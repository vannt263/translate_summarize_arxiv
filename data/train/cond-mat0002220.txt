    "anomalous normal - state properties of superconducting cuprates @xcite have stimulated intense theoretical investigations of models of strongly correlated electrons describing the interplay between antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering of reference ( undoped ) insulating substances and the itinerant character of charge carriers introduced by doping .",
    "for the understanding of superconductivity the most challenging regime is that of intermediate ( optimum ) doping .",
    "however , even the apparently simplest region of weak doping is not fully understood theoretically .",
    "recently , the attention in experimental and theoretical investigations of cuprates has been given to characterization and understanding of different doping regimes @xcite . in a simple picture",
    ", weak doping should correspond to the regime where properties vary linearly with the concentration of holes , i.e.  one can deal with a semiconductor - like model where charge carriers ( holes ) are independent and well defined quasiparticles .",
    "this requires a nonsingular variation of thermodynamic quantities with doping .",
    "however , this scenario has been questioned near the metal ",
    "insulator transition based also on numerical solutions for some model systems @xcite , e.g.  the hubbard model .",
    "alternative possibilities include phase separation @xcite , quantum critical behavior @xcite or other instabilities at low doping .",
    "still , singular behavior in a planar ( 2d ) system is expected only at @xmath2 , while @xmath3 should lead to a regular variation with doping .    among the least understood properties of charge carriers in cuprates and correlated systems in general",
    "are those related to the coupling of their orbital motion to an external magnetic field . evidently anomalous and not understood",
    "is the hall constant in cuprates which reveals unusual temperature and doping dependence @xcite .",
    "another quantity is the diamagnetic ( orbital ) susceptibility @xmath4 , which for noninteracting electrons corresponds to landau diamagnetism @xcite and seems to be connected to the hall response @xcite .",
    "anomalous paramagnetic - like variation with magnetic field has been noticed within the ground state of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite at low doping .",
    "recent @xmath3 studies of a single hole within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite confirm the existence of a paramagnetic regime at intermediate @xmath5 , though the systems studied were quite small .",
    "conclusive experimental results on diamagnetic susceptibility are lacking @xcite , since the orbital part appears quite hidden by other contributions , although it could be distinguished via the anisotropy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the thermodynamic properties and orbital response of correlated electrons at finite temperature in the low - doping regime .",
    "most numerical studies of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model have so far focused on the ground - state properties @xcite , employing exact diagonalization of small systems , projector monte carlo , and density matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg ) .",
    "recently , the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) has been introduced , which allows insight into the statics and dynamics at @xmath3 . in previous applications",
    "certain thermodynamic quantities have also been investigated as a function of doping . in this paper",
    "we focus on the low doping regime , where the method can be compared with the alternative approach , a novel adaptation of the worldline quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) cluster method @xcite which allows for the study of much larger systems at least for temperatures @xmath6 below which the minus - sign problem sets in .",
    "large systems are particularly important for the study of diamagnetic response which appears to be quite sensitive to finite size effects . in both cases ,",
    "new ways of dealing with the magnetic field are introduced .",
    "related qmc methods have been used to study nonmagnetic properties of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , in an exploratory calculation for doped chains and for ladders with 1 and 2 holes @xcite , in two dimensions at @xmath7 with 1 or 2 holes @xcite , and for chains at finite @xmath1 in a background of no holes @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "the planar @xmath0-@xmath1 model as a representative model for strongly correlated electrons and electronic properties of cuprates is studied , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are fermionic operators , projecting out sites with double occupancy .",

    "section ii of the paper is devoted to a brief introduction of both numerical techniques employed , qmc and ftlm . in sec .",
    "iii results for several thermodynamic properties in the low - doping regime are presented and discussed .",
    "iv is devoted to the discussion of the orbital susceptibility of the system .",

    "results of both methods for doped systems are compared and presented relative to the undoped heisenberg afm . for large enough systems we expect to reach a typical behavior in the low doping regime .",
    "the loop cluster algorithm ( lca ) for the world - line qmc has been introduced by one of the present authors @xcite and recently adapted also to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the worldline representation of the quantum qmc .",
    "the hamiltonian , eq .  [ eq : model ] , on a 2d square lattice can be split within the standard trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite into four parts @xmath13 consisting of mutually commuting terms . this is equivalent to the well known checkerboard decomposition of hamiltonians in 1d .",

    "the time evolution operator is applied .",
    "since the hamiltonian is total spin conserving , we can track time evolution of a particular spin along its so called _ worldline _ ( wl ) . because of the cyclic property of the trace , the wls are periodic in the imaginary time interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the time evolution operator acts only on @xmath20 plaquettes and the weight of the configuration @xmath21 factorizes into a product of plaquette weights .",
    "the partition function @xmath22 is formally that of a ( @xmath23)-dimensional classical system . the thermal average of an observable @xmath24 can be obtained by @xmath25 such thermal expectation values are calculated by means of monte carlo ( mc ) importance sampling , where a sequence of configurations @xmath26 ( markov chain ) is constructed , which obeys detailed balance and reproduces the correct boltzmann distribution @xmath27 .",
    "thermal expectation values now become simple averages @xmath28 in practice , monte carlo runs are finite , @xmath29 , leading to statistical errors which can be calculated from the standard deviation of partial data sets @xcite .    in standard local algorithms",
    "an update from one configuration @xmath30 to another @xmath31 in the markov chain represents a small local change of the wls .",
    "therefore , consecutive configurations are highly correlated , which drastically increases the necessary number of monte carlo steps .",
    "such difficulties are overcome in the lca @xcite which introduces global ( nonlocal ) stochastic updates that effectively reduce the correlations . in the lca formulation",
    "also the continuous time limit @xmath32 can be taken @xcite avoiding the second order systematic error of eq .",
    "[ eq : trotter ] . for certain observables improved estimators can be easily constructed allowing a potential reduction of statistical errors .",
    "for more details we refer to the introductory paper @xcite .",

    "the update procedure is split into three substeps , allowing the application of the standard lca for the @xmath33 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model or for free fermions in all three cases . within each substep , only updates between two of the possible three states ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and hole @xmath36 ) are performed . for the weights of particular plaquettes and other technical details we refer to @xcite .    in case of negative weights @xmath37 , their magnitude @xmath38 is taken for construction of the mc procedure , since the negative @xmath21 can not be taken as a probability .",

    "let us briefly comment on the origin of negative signs in the wl formulation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . in the system with no doped holes the only source of negative weights are plaquettes , where two opposite spins exchange their positions representing a spin flip .",
    "because of the periodicity of wls in time direction and the absence of holes spin flips always occur in even numbers , producing no net negative sign . in the pure heisenberg model , this sign",
    "can also be transformed away by rotation of spins on one sublattice , resulting in all - positive plaquette weights @xcite .",
    "for one hole doped into the afm one would naively not expect a sign problem , e.g. , in this case there is no sign in the exact diagonalization approach .",
    "examining the particle wls surrounding the hole wl one finds , however , that an exchange of two fermions can occur when @xmath42 and @xmath43 , producing an odd number of spin flips , i.e.  a negative sign , as can be seen schematically in a small @xmath44 system , @xmath45 where a loop motion of the hole @xmath46 around the system and a consecutive spin flip @xmath47 reproduce the original configuration with two fermions @xmath34 and @xmath48 interchanged .",
    "measuring the sign here reduces to spin flip counting .",
    "for higher concentration of holes a more general expression for the sign of the configuration can be obtained .",
    "it links fermion wl ( @xmath49 ) and hole wl permutation ( @xmath50 ) @xmath51 so that for low doping it is preferable to measure @xmath50 rather than @xmath49 .",
    "the sign problem also complicates the use of the improved estimators since for every observable a separate algorithm must be devised .    to follow the emergence of the sign problem as well as the development of diamagnetic properties it is convenient to generalize the isotropic spin interaction term of the model eq .",

    "recently , though , a way around the sign problem has been proposed by calculating fermion propagators for a background of no holes @xcite .    for",
    "a fixed number of holes , the average sign will converge as the system size increases .",
    "this convergence could be taken as a another criterion that the limit of a dilute system has been reached .      in the analysis of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model",
    "the exact diagonalization of small systems using the lanczos algorithm has been extensively employed @xcite , predominantly in the investigation of the static and dynamic properties of the ground state .",
    "more recently a ftlm combining the lanczos procedure and random sampling was introduced @xcite , allowing the calculation of @xmath3 static and dynamic properties of correlated systems .",
    "the application is particularly simple for an arbitrary function of conserved quantities , e.g.  @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are ( approximate ) eigenfunctions and energies , respectively , obtained by diagonalization within the reduced orthonormal set , generated from the initial functions @xmath67 in @xmath68 lanczos steps .",

    "it is however important to realize that for a particular system , finite - size effects start to be pronounced at @xmath73 where , e.g. , some characteristic length - scale becomes larger than the system size . in our case of low doping , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,",
    "we find @xmath76 .",
    "all our results are presented for @xmath77 where @xmath78 . in the present study @xmath79 so that at least 30 states are sampled in the thermal averages @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the ftlm gives also the correct ground state within the chosen small system .",
    "thermodynamic properties @xmath80 depend on the hole concentration @xmath81 . for the weak doping limit",
    ", one would expect a linear dependence for most quantities . for a finite system size ,",
    "the relevant parameter is thus the number of holes @xmath82 doped into the afm . in the low - doping regime",
    "it makes sense to represent the results as a difference @xmath83 to distinguish the change in a particular quantity with doping , this notation is used in the following . if , e.g. , @xmath84 behaves quantitatively as @xmath85 one can conclude that the quantity changes linearly with the number of added holes @xmath82 , i.e.the holes behave as independent entities , and the system sizes are large enough so that the low - doping regime has indeed been reached .",
    "such behavior is however not the only possibility at low doping , since one can expect , e.g. , even - odd effects in the case of pairing of holes .",

    "the binding energy is negative and thus pointing to the attractive interaction between the holes . with the increase of the temperature",
    "the bound state disintegrates and the difference @xmath96 approaches zero . in the case of a small system",
    "the difference can even become positive but vanishes with increasing system size .",
    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : eng ] that @xmath98 is not a monotonous function .",
    "the ground state of a single hole introduced into the afm is quite well understood via analytical approaches @xcite and numerical calculations @xcite . for @xmath11 ,",

    "@xmath98 has not been considered so far .",
    "an interpretation of its behavior can be given as follows .",

    "the effect is thus first a decrease of @xmath199 with decreasing @xmath5 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaj ]",
    ". turnover to the diverging diamagnetic @xmath4 should happen only when the coherent quasiparticle is formed at @xmath200 .",
    "@xmath201 should scale with the inverse of the quasiparticle effective mass @xmath202 .",
    "it is known that @xmath203 can become very large for the extreme @xmath58 case , in particular for larger @xmath1 .",
    "this explains why we can not reach the coherent regime for @xmath204 even at @xmath205 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dchi ] ) , while the downturn is indeed observed for @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaj ] ) .    at @xmath208 ,",
    "the results are qualitatively different .",
    "the most pronounced effect is the change into a paramagnetic @xmath4 for @xmath209 .",
    "the width of this @xmath5 window is quite large .",
    "in fact within the ftlm and qmc data we are unable to locate the reentrance temperature @xmath201 into the diamagnetic response , although the latter is expected @xcite .",
    "an argument for the low value of @xmath201 can be given in terms of a very shallow energy minimum which defines the quasiparticle dispersion near the ground - state of a hole in an afm within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite , hence the quasiparticle looses its character already at very low excitation energies .",
    "still the paramagnetic response in the window @xmath210 remains to be explained .",
    "let us finally discuss also results for @xmath4 for finite doping @xmath211 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : chich ] .",
    "the easiest regime to interpret is that of a nearly empty band , i.e.  @xmath212 , where @xmath4 is diamagnetic and nearly independent of @xmath5 . in this regime",
    "the electron system is dilute and strong correlations are unimportant , hence landau diamagnetism is expected . at moderate temperatures @xmath101 and for an intermediate - doping regime , @xmath213 , @xmath4 is dominated by a paramagnetic response with a peak at approximately @xmath214 . as consistent with results at low doping , there is a weak diamagnetism at @xmath215 and @xmath216 , while the paramagnetic regime extends to @xmath217 for @xmath209 . for low temperatures @xmath218 quite pronounced oscillations in @xmath219 appear and",
    "can be partly attributed to finite - system effects .",
    "certain aspects of the above results for @xmath219 can be understood using the hte .",
    "one is the asymmetry between @xmath220 and @xmath221 at higher @xmath130 . in the lowest order of the hte , only hopping of the electrons around a basic plaquette loop",
    "has to be considered .",
    "the signal on the @xmath222 side of @xmath219 is thus reduced by a factor of @xmath223 against the @xmath224 side since in the first case only the plaquettes with ferromagnetically aligned spins contribute .",
    "let us first compare both numerical methods used in the analysis of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at low doping .",
    "the qmc method allows the studies of larger systems and the loop algorithm solves some serious drawbacks of the mc methods .",
    "it is indeed very efficient in cases where there is no sign problem , e.g.  the anisotropic model @xmath58 at @xmath56 . within the wl approach it is also very easy to formulate and measure certain responses like the orbital susceptibility @xmath4 .",
    "still the method suffers from a sign problem ( for @xmath225 ) even for a single hole @xmath56 in an afm ( though not in a background of no holes @xcite ) .",
    "results are thus in practice limited to @xmath226 for the isotropic case @xmath227 . on the other hand",
    "the ftlm has no minus - sign problem but rather limitations due to small systems which can be studied .",
    "these are even more pronounced in cases with @xmath170 where the translational symmetry is lost .",
    "it is an interesting observation that within the ftlm , the limiting temperature @xmath228 for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is in most cases quite close to the lowest @xmath5 reached by the qmc method .",
    "we have presented several results for thermodynamic quantities , i.e.energy @xmath229 , specific heat @xmath108 , entropy @xmath230 and spin susceptibility @xmath127 , as a function of @xmath5 at low doping . at @xmath231",
    "all results are consistent with the picture where holes introduced into the afm behave as independent ( nondegenerate ) particles .",
    "the perturbation introduced into the afm by holes is quite large even at lowest @xmath132 , in particular visible from @xmath110 and @xmath123 , consistent with experiments in cuprates @xcite .",
    "results for the orbital susceptibility @xmath4 , now obtained also for much larger systems using the qmc method , confirm the preliminary ftlm results @xcite , indicating an anomalous paramagnetic response at low doping in an intermediate window of temperatures @xmath232 ( for the isotropic model @xmath227 ) .",
    "in fact within our numerical studies it is hard to reach the lower end of this window , meaning that @xmath233 .",
    "still , the reentrance into a diamagnetic behavior is expected from theoretical arguments on the existence of a well defined quasiparticle at @xmath198 , as well as from more reliable qmc results for the @xmath58 case @xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic response at intermediate @xmath5 can be viewed also as an extension of a more pronounced @xmath234 regime observed at finite doping @xmath235 at all @xmath5 .",
    "the explanation can thus go in the direction proposed by laughlin @xcite , that at low doping @xmath220 we are dealing with quasiparticles ( with a diamagnetic response ) , being a bound composite of charge ( holon ) and spin ( spinon ) elementary excitations .",
    "the binding appears however to be quite weak and thus easily destroyed by finite @xmath5 or @xmath124 , enabling the independent response of constituents , which apparently is paramagnetic .        for a review ,",
