    "we therefore neglect the @xmath148- and @xmath149-dependencies in the following and write @xmath158 with @xmath159 ( @xmath160 are bosonic matsubara frequencies ) .",
    "the condition for odlro can only be satisfied if @xmath154 contains averages @xmath161 of the order of unity .",
    "@xcite    since we have found only one pole for a given momentum in our numerics , in what follows we restrict ourselves to the case that @xmath162 exhibits a single pole ( the generalization to multiple poles would be straightforward ) .",
    "we have @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the residuum of the pole @xmath165 at momentum @xmath21 . for sufficiently low - lying poles",
    "we find @xmath166 ( note that the boundary to the electron - hole continuum is located at finite energies).@xcite for @xmath167 to be of the order of @xmath17 , @xmath165 must vanish .",
    "that is , the presence of odlro of electron - hole pairs implies a gapless electron - hole excitation spectrum .",
    "since any finite electron - phonon coupling introduces a gap , in our model odlro is only present if the ei phase transition is driven by the electronic correlations caused by the coulomb interaction of type eq .  .",
    "regardless of the particular driving mechanism , @xmath168 serves as an order parameter for the low - temperature long - range ordered phase .",
    "phase fluctuations of @xmath37 may destroy the ordered state , e.g. , in one - dimensional systems or two - dimensional systems at finite temperatures.@xcite the lattice degrees of freedom may suppress these fluctuations , supporting thereby long - range order . in this connection",
    ", we like to emphasize that the nature of the ordered low - temperature phase in the purely electronic model , exhibiting a @xmath93 symmetry in the normal phase , significantly differs from the low - temperature phase in the model containing the coupling to the lattice , where the @xmath93 symmetry is absent even in the normal phase . for the latter , odlro is absent ( see discussion above ) , and",
    "we therefore suppose that a finite @xmath37 is not indicative of any kind of  electron - hole pair condensate \" with  supertransport \" properties . to date the identification of a measurable quantity verifying odlro in the materials considered as potential candidates for realizing the ei phase is , to the best of our knowledge , an open problem .",
    "in this work we have revisited on what terms an excitonic insulator ( ei ) forms . in particular , we have analyzed the effects of an explicit electron - phonon interaction @xmath62 .",
    "the potential ei state then may possess a static lattice distortion .",
    "we have shown that @xmath62 will not change the single - particle spectra qualitatively , even if self - energy effects are taken into account .",
    "however , @xmath62 significantly modifies the electron - hole pair spectrum . to demonstrate this , we have calculated the contributions of the electron - phonon interaction to electron - hole pairing within the kadanoff - baym approach including ring and ladder diagrams .",
    "when the electron - phonon coupling is neglected the phase mode is acoustic .",
    "electron - lattice coupling destroys the acoustic mode regardless if it causes a static lattice distortion or renormalizes the effective electron - electron interaction .",
    "we pointed out that an acoustic phase mode implies the presence of off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) , and therefore indicates  in a strongly coupled electron - hole system  an exciton  condensate \" .",
    "this applies to the ei phase in pure electronic models as , e.g. , the extended falicov - kimball model .",
    "@xcite since in most of the ( potential ) ei materials considered so far , the lattice degrees of freedom play a non - negligible role , they should prevent , according to the reasonings of this paper , the appearance of an acoustic phase mode .",
    "hence these materials embody rather unusual ( gapped ) charge - density - wave systems than true exciton condensates with super - transport properties ( cf .",
    "the remark by kohn in the supplementary discussion in ref .  ) .    to realize an exciton condensate in equilibrium experimentally , bilayer systems , such as graphene double layers and bilayers ,  @xcite are the most promising candidates at present .",
    "since the interband tunneling processes can be suppressed by suitable dielectrics , an acoustic collective mode , and hence odlro , may emerge . in these systems electrons and holes",
    "occupy different layers and the exciton condensation is presumably accompanied by the appearance of supercurrents in both layers that flow in opposite directions ,  @xcite respectively , the occurrence of a dipolar supercurrent .",
    "@xcite    let us finally emphasize that the numerical results presented in this work are obtained using rather crude approximations .",
    "that is why a more elaborated numerical treatment is highly desirable .",
    "a possible next step is to calculate the dynamical structure factor , which is accessible experimentally by electron energy - loss spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite here , collective modes show up as peaks and one might address the acoustic phase - mode problem .",
    "the phase invariance leading to the acoustic phase mode might also be reflected in josephson - like phenomena induced by tunneling excitons .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the plasmon mode in the low - temperature state has not been elaborated yet .",
    "this mode is generated by intraband correlations and shows an acoustic behavior in the normal phase .",
    "@xcite we mentioned that the inclusion of exchange terms in the coulomb interaction destroys the phase invariance , just as the electron - phonon interaction considered in this work .",
    "@xcite however , electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions do not have to promote the same values for the phase of @xmath37 ; thus it is interesting to analyze the consequences of their interplay . in particular , cooling down the system , the phase realized may alter .",
    "another worthwhile continuation concerns the possible formation and condensation of  polaron excitons , \" i.e. , the buildup of a condensate of excitons which are dressed by a phonon cloud .",
