    "the gravimetric atom interferometer ( gain ) was developed and built at humboldt universitt zu berlin to perform mobile high - precision gravity measurements .",
    "it is based on interfering ensembles of @xmath0rb atoms in an atomic fountain configuration and stimulated raman transitions .",
    "[ fig : physicspackage ] shows the working principle of the instrument , a complete description has been published elsewhere@xcite . during",
    "free fall the atomic matter - waves are split vertically in space , reflected and recombined using a mach - zehnder @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath1 pulse sequence , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : physicspackage](b ) .",
    "the output phase of the interferometer depends on the local light phase at the atomic positions during the pulses .",
    "this corresponds@xcite to a threefold sampling of the ballistic trajectory and thus a @xmath3 measurement , when neglecting the spatial splitting of the wave - packets during the interferometry sequence .",
    "the measurement sequence starts with a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) loading approximately @xmath4 laser - cooled @xmath0rb atoms within . the cloud is then launched upwards using far - detuned moving molasses achieving a temperature of and a vertical velocity of .",
    "after a previously described process@xcite which selects only atoms in the magnetically insensitive sub - state within a narrow vertical velocity class , the cloud reaches the elongated magnetically shielded interferometry region .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath1 raman pulse sequence is then conducted with a time @xmath5 between pulses .",
    "afterwards , the upper state population @xmath6 is detected using a fluorescence detection system which yields an interference signal @xmath7 with contrast @xmath8 and offset @xmath9 .",
    "the next measurement is then started with a cycle time of .",
    "the interferometer phase @xmath10 is connected to the gravity value @xmath3 by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the effective wave - number of the raman transitions , @xmath13 is a constant frequency chirp rate of the raman laser which compensates for the time - varying doppler - shift of the atoms during free fall , and @xmath14 is a configurable raman laser phase which can be used to scan the interferometer fringe . in order to deduce @xmath10 at a new measurement site , interference fringes are first scanned by altering the rf chirp rate @xmath13 for several values of @xmath15 .",
    "their positions overlap at the desired chirp rate value where @xmath16 which removes the phase ambiguity due to the fringe pattern , compare above equation and fig .",
    ".    the inertial reference is provided by a retro - reflection mirror shown in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : physicspackage](a ) which therefore has to be decoupled from environmental vibrations .",
    "this is realised with an active vibration isolation system@xcite .",
    "due to its limited isolation at micro - seismic frequencies of , residual vibrations are contained in its feedback loop error signal . feeding this signal into a previously demonstrated post - correction algorithm@xcite thus further reduces interferometer phase noise by a factor 2 to 4 , depending on the micro - seismic background .",
    "special care was taken during the development of gain to ensure that the set - up is small and robust enough for transport to other locations with minimal effort .",
    "it thus consists of 3 modular units@xcite with a respective size of roughly .",
    "after completion of the set - up and initial gravity comparisons in berlin@xcite , two measurement campaigns were carried out at remote locations .",
    "the 1^st^ took place in november 2013 at the geodetic observatory in wettzell , the 2^nd^ in february 2015 at onsala space observatory near gothenburg , sweden .",
    "both locations were chosen because the local gravity values are known very accurately due to several measurement campaigns conducted with fccg during the last years@xcite .",
    "they furthermore operate scgs for high - precision monitoring of temporal gravity changes which proved invaluable for characterizing the performance of the gain gravimeter .",
    "while conducting the 2^nd^ campaign in onsala , the state - of - the - art fccg fg5x-220 performed a simultaneous measurement for a direct comparison of the instrumental properties . during both campaigns",
    "a small truck was used to transport gain to the destination sites .",
    "transport and set - up took approximately 3 days until the first gravity data were produced , a delay which could be shortened in the future to less than a day through optimization of the work - flow and small alterations of gain .",
    "0.495    0.495",
    "a five day segment of the gravity data taken during both campaigns is shown in the upper half of fig .",
    "[ fig : gravitydata ] , showing temporal variations due to earth tides , atmospheric and other environmental effects @xcite . in order to characterize the gravimeter s stability ,",
    "these variations need to be subtracted from the gravity signal . below a magnitude of it",
    "is not sufficient to use only synthetic models for this purpose because remaining signals caused by incomplete atmospheric correction , tidal modelling and local water storage fluctuations can reach up to a few .",
    "we thus use the scg as a reference to assess instrumental effects in gain . as shown in the bottom half of fig .",
    "[ fig : gravitydata ] , both instrument are in excellent agreement .",
    "the residuals obtained by subtracting both datasets do not contain visible signals within the error bars of the measurement . the detailed analysis in fig .",
    "[ fig : allandev ] shows that they resemble white noise on time - scales below . beyond this",
    "the relative stability improves further and reaches , or , for a time - scale of or approximately one day .",
    "this is the best reported stability for an absolute gravimeter to our knowledge and shows the excellent control of any time - variable systematic effects in gain as listed in table [ tab : systematics ] . comparing scg and",
    "gain data on the sub- level requires scg scale factor calibration significantly better then which is beyond standard fccg results@xcite .",
    "the scale factor was thus re - obtained for both campaigns using 5 days of gain gravity data , yielding values consistent with previous calibrations but improved uncertainties of and , respectively . even under optimized schedules@xcite , low micro - seismic noise and maximal tidal amplitude , fg5 instruments would need at least three weeks to achieve a similar precision which demonstrates the value of gain s improved resolution .",
    "0.495    0.495    the absolute gravity values were compared to the reference value during the 1^st^ campaign and to the simultaneously measured fg5x-220 result during the 2^nd^ campaign .",
    "both comparisons show excellent agreement within their specified @xmath17 uncertainties as shown in table [ tab : comparison ] .",
    "the gain values are slightly higher in both cases with differences of and .",
    "the achieved level of accuracy is slightly better than another value @xcite obtained using atom interferometry and comparable to the level provided by the fg5(x ) , where individual instruments differ by @xcite .",
    "the biggest uncertainty is caused by raman laser wave - front distortions as shown in table [ tab : systematics ] .",
    "they have been reduced by wave - front measurements and a correcting model @xcite which was applied to all optical elements in the raman beam path except the lower vacuum window . in the future",
    "this effect could be decreased further by reducing the cloud expansion through advanced cooling techniques or a more complete correction .",
    "due to stormy winter weather and the proximity to the kattegat coastline , micro - seismic vibrations were strongly elevated during parts of the 2^nd^ campaign .",
    "this did not affect the gain sensor as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allandev](b ) , but increased the fg5x noise level roughly five - fold as observed before@xcite .",
    "gain s improved tolerance to micro - seismic vibrations is due to its repetition rate , as opposed to of the fg5x , and more effective isolation system .",
    "this shows a general advantage of atomic gravimeters compared to fccgs which rely on low levels of micro - seismic excitation .",
    "atomic sensors also do not excite vibrations of the floor / pillar as the test - masses involved in the measurement are negligible , which altogether enables low - noise operation not only on dedicated concrete pillars but also on regular flooring .",
    "this extends their range to a vastly increased number of measurement sites which , in combination with their continuous , drift - free , absolute measurement , will improve results in applications such as monitoring of tidal , hydrological or geophysical gravity signals with amplitudes in the range on long time - scales where spring - based instruments are limited by non - linear drifts .",
    "albeit gain can not yet reach the ultimate low short - term noise level provided by scg , the values demonstrated here are comparable to those of state - of - the - art spring - based relative gravimeters @xcite without their long - term drifts .",
    "the noise level of mobile atomic gravimeters may in the future be improved through further optimization of vibration isolators@xcite , hybrid sensor strategies@xcite or advanced techniques such as interleaved fountain operation@xcite .",
    "the comparison between two types of absolute gravimeters based on fundamentally different measurement principles , namely fccg and atomic gravimeters , is beneficial in its own right and will boost the search for hidden systematic effects and increase the accuracy of today s gravity networks .",
    "we further anticipate that the robust and adaptable architecture of cold atom interferometry will enable the development of self - contained , compact and rugged instruments for applications which so far were not accessible to absolute gravimetry .",
    "for instance , airborne and shipborne gravity surveys will benefit from the characteristics of atomic gravimeters and gradiometers due to their intrinsic immunity to hysteresis effects which deteriorate the performance of current spring - based instruments during turbulence@xcite .",
    "drift - free , continuous operation at places such as underground systems , boreholes or even the sea floor will exceed the operating range of existing spring - based gravimeters and enable new insights in earth sciences and geodesy ."
