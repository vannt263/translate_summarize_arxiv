    "<S> . however , this could be as well just sample - specific since the mobility in the hole side was significantly lower compared to the electron side .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : moiree_pnp]e . </S>",
    "<S> the latter analysis is performed instead of the cavity length analysis since equation  [ cavity - length ] does not hold any more if the fermi - energy is tuned beyond the satellite dp . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in equation  [ cavity - length ] a circular fermi - surface and electron like dispersion is assumed , which does not hold in the presence of a strong band - modulation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , mapping the fp resonance peak position as a function of charge - carrier density is free of any assumptions and therefore independent of the band - structure . if the semitransparent interfaces are defined via the main dp , the evolution of @xmath55 between neighboring peaks as a function of @xmath2 is in good agreement with the values extracted from theory ( transport simulation in the absence of a moir superlattice ) , which is indicated with the black , dashed line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : moiree_pnp]e . </S>",
    "<S> if the semitransparent interfaces are defined via the satellite dps , the density - spacing between the fp resonance peaks is further increased on both , the electron and hole side .    </S>",
    "<S> although a precise extraction of the cavity size is not possible with equation  [ cavity - length ] , an estimate can still be given . </S>",
    "<S> we have found a cavity size of @xmath29 on the electron side if the density is measured from the main dp , whereas setting the density to zero at the satellite dp gives an unphysical cavity size ( @xmath29 ) . on the electron side the density of states seems almost unaltered , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moiree_pnp]b , however the band - structure is substantially modified , which can be seen in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the band - structure consists of two nonisotropic bands above the satellite dps which makes the situation rather complex , with different visibilities and angle dependent transmissions for the two bands . </S>",
    "<S> on the hole side the cavity size analysis yields cavity sizes of @xmath29 if the density is measured from the main dp . at the satellite </S>",
    "<S> dp the density of states decreases to zero , meaning that a real dirac point is formed </S>",
    "<S> . therefore one might expect , that the density for the fp oscillations should be measured from the satellite dp . </S>",
    "<S> however by setting the charge - carrier density to zero at the hole satellite dp , the analysis gives unphysical results . </S>",
    "<S> we note , that close to the hole satellite dp equation  [ cavity - length ] should be valid if counting the charge - carrier density from the satellite dp , since the band - structure is isotropic . besides the most pronounced fp resonances indicated with the purple arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moiree_pnp]d , a second set of resonances with a much shorter period seem to appear in the very vicinity of the hole satellite dp ( see inset of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : moiree_pnp]d ) . for these resonances </S>",
    "<S> the extracted cavity length leads only to reasonable values ( @xmath29 ) when counting the charge carrier density starting from the satellite dp . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the residual doping ( @xmath56 ) prevents us from resolving more of these features in the very vicinity of the satellite dp </S>",
    "<S> . a possible explanation for the different behavior of the two sets of fp oscillation ( @xmath16 ) might be the following : the small resonances are only observed up to densities of @xmath57 ( where @xmath57 is measured from the satellite dp ) , where the moir miniband remains close to dirac like ( linear dispersion relation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy corresponding to theses small oscillations is consequently exclusively tuned in the linear part of the moir miniband ( see supporting information ) . from the band - structures </S>",
    "<S> we would expect that the small oscillations should be visible up to higher doping values , namely values which are larger by a factor of up to @xmath58 depending on the model . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is based on the energy - spacing between the satellite dp and the first van hove singularity at higher energies , extracted from theory ( see supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the extracted energy - spacing corresponds to an upper bound within which the dispersion relation might be considered as linear . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy corresponding to the stronger resonances indicated with the purple arrow , does partially reside outside of the linear region of the dirac cones where the band - structure becomes more complex , including singularities and band - overlaps .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the work of lee _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite they suggest that model 3 , which is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : moiree_pnp]b , is the one describing the experimental situation best . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for model 1 , where multiple satellite dps appear near every main dp , equation  [ cavity - length ] would also have to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the additional degeneracy of the satellite dirac cones . </S>",
    "<S> although by including additional degeneracies , and counting the density from the satellite dp , the strong oscillations could give reasonable cavity sizes , however , for the small oscillations , the additional degeneracies would result in too large cavity sizes . moreover , most experimental evidence points to a single dirac cone at the satellite dp . </S>",
    "<S> we also note here , that the visibility of these resonances are quite low , which could also introduce some experimental error in the analysis .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we first analysed a _ pnp_-junction in the absence of a moir superlattice where the varying visibility of the different types of fp resonances could be linked to sharp and smooth _ pn_-junctions in the system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the change of the effective cavity length depending on @xmath2 and @xmath3 could be mapped via the fp resonances . in a second sample , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a moir superlattice gave rise to satellite dps and the modified band - structure resulted in confinement of electronic trajectories and in the appearance of fp resonances . </S>",
    "<S> although the oscillations are formed in the moir minibands , they can mostly be described as if they would originate from the non - modified band - structures . </S>",
    "<S> further studies will be needed to explain these findings .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show that confinement of electrons can be obtained using miniband engineering . </S>",
    "<S> future studies can investigate the angle dependent transmission properties of such an interface . moreover combining the studies of transverse magnetic focusing @xcite and bias spectroscopy </S>",
