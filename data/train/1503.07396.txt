    "ebola is a lethal virus for humans .",
    "it was previously confined to central africa but recently was also identified in west africa @xcite . as of october 8 , 2014 , the world health organization ( who ) reported 4656 cases of ebola virus deaths , with most cases occurring in liberia @xcite .",
    "the extremely rapid increase of the disease and the high mortality rate make this virus a major problem for public health .",
    "typically , patients present fever , malaise , abdominal , headache , and asthenia .",
    "one week after the onset of symptoms , a rash often appears followed by haemorrhagic complications , leading to death after an average of 10 days in 50%90% of infections @xcite .",
    "ebola is transmitted through direct contact with blood , bodily secretions and tissues of infected ill or dead humans and non - human primates @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this work is to understand the dynamics of the liberian population infected by ebola virus in 2014 , by using an appropriate mathematical model .",
    "more precisely , we begin by considering a system of ordinary differential equations to describe the 2014 ebola outbreak , which is nothing else than an epidemic sir model , that is , a model based on the division of the population into three groups : the susceptible , the infected , and the recovered @xcite .",
    "we simulate the model obtained by parameters estimated on november 4 , 2014 , by kaurov @xcite .",
    "our objectives are to better understand the outbreak and to predict the effect of vaccination on the infected individuals over time .    in order to deal with the epidemic of ebola",
    ", governments have decided to implement tough measures .",
    "for example , some have applied quarantine procedures while others have opted for mass vaccination plans as a precaution to the epidemic @xcite . in this context",
    ", we consider an optimal control problem to study the effect of vaccination on the spread of virus .",
    "the text is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce a basic mathematical model to describe the dynamics of the ebola virus during the 2014 outbreak in liberia . after the mathematical modelling",
    ", we use the obtained model to simulate it in section  [ sec:3 ] with the parameters estimated from recent statistical data based on the who report of the 2014 ebola outbreak @xcite . following @xcite , in section  [ sec : vac ]",
    "we study different cases of vaccination of individuals by adding a vaccination term to the model .",
    "section  [ sec_control ] presents an optimal control problem , which we use to study the impact of a vaccination campaign on the spread of the virus .",
    "we end with section  [ sec:4 ] of conclusions and future work , where the results are summarized and some research perspectives presented .",
    "the objective of this section is to describe mathematically the dynamics of the population infected by the ebola virus .",
    "the dynamics is described by a system of differential equations .",
    "this system is based on the common sir ( susceptible - infectious - recovery ) epidemic model , where the population is divided into three groups : the susceptible group , denoted by @xmath0 , the infected group , denoted by @xmath1 , and the recovered group , denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the total population , assumed constant during the short period of time under study , is given by @xmath3 .    to create the equations that describe the population of each group along time , let us start with the fact that the population of the susceptible group will be reduced as the infected come into contact with them with a rate of infection @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the change in the population of susceptible is equal to the negative product of @xmath4 with @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath5 now , let us create the equation that describes the infected group over time , knowing that the population of this group changes in two ways :    ( i ) : :    people leave the susceptible group and join the infected group , thus    adding to the total population of infected a term    @xmath6 ; ( ii ) : :    people leave the infected group and join the recovered group , reducing    the infected population by @xmath7 .",
    "this is written as @xmath8 finally , the equation that describes the recovery population is based on the individuals recovered from the virus at rate @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the recovery group is increased by @xmath9 multiplied by @xmath1 : @xmath10 figure  [ sir_fig1 ] shows the relationship between the three variables of our sir model .",
    "as shown in the next section , this simple model describes well the 2014 ebola outbreak in liberia for suitable chosen parameters @xmath4 and @xmath9 and appropriate initial conditions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "with the aim to approximate the 2014 ebola outbreak in liberia , we now simulate the complete set of equations  that describe the sir model : @xmath14 \\dfrac{di(t)}{dt } = \\beta \\dfrac{s(t)i(t)}{n } - \\mu i(t),\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\dfrac{dr(t)}{dt } = \\mu i(t ) , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the rate of infection and @xmath9 the rate of recovery .",
    "the data for the outbreak in liberia is based on the cumulative numbers of total reported cases ( confirmed and probable ) taken from the official data reported by the ministry of health of liberia up to october 26 , 2014 , as provided by the world health organisation ( who ) @xcite ( in particular , the ebola virus disease cases reported each week from liberia are given in figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the model fits well the reported data of confirmed ( means infected ) cases in liberia .",
    "note that the exact population size @xmath15 does not need to be known to estimate the model parameters as long as the number of cases is small compared to the total population size @xcite . to estimate the parameters of the model",

    ", we describe the evolution of each group of individuals over time and the link between them .",

    "the real data of confirmed cases for the 2014 ebola outbreak occurred in liberia , taken from @xcite , is shown with circles.,width=377 ]    when we compare our results with those of astacio et al .",
    "@xcite , when they modeled the 1976 outbreak of ebola in yambuku , a small village in mongala district in northern democratic republic of congo ( previously zaire ) , and the 1995 outbreak of ebola in kikwit , in the southwestern part of the democratic republic of congo , we note that the evolution of each group obtained in our simulations is reasonable .",
    "the main difference between the 2014 outbreak of ebola in liberia and the previous outbreaks of ebola in yambuku and kikwit studied in @xcite is at the end of the evolution of infected : while in the previous 1976 and 1995 outbreaks of ebola in yambuku and kikwit the infected group goes to zero , now in the 2014 outbreak of ebola in liberia the infected group remains important with a high number of infected individuals by the virus , which describes the reality of what is currently happening in liberia .",
    "one can conclude that the 2014 ebola outbreak of liberia is much more dangerous than the previous ebola outbreaks .",
    "in this section , we simulate the model by using parameters estimated on november 4 , 2014 , by kaurov @xcite , who studied statistically the recent data of the world health organisation ( who ) @xcite . in his statistical study ,",
    "kaurov studied the outbreak by modeling it with wolfram s language . here",
    "we use his sir model for modelling and time - discrete equations for resolution of the set of equations through .",

    "the parameters obtained by kaurov , knowing that 95% of population is susceptible and 5% of population is infected , are @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite . in agreement ,",
    "the initial susceptible , infected , and recovered populations are given , respectively , by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath22 ( note that in contrast with sections  [ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] , the variables are now dimensionless ) .",

    ", @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath22.[result_sir1],width=377 ]    an important dimensionless quantity that plays a key role in any sir model is the well - known basic reproduction number @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this number tells us how fast the disease will spread at the epidemic . for model ,",
    "the basic reproduction number is simply given by @xmath31 .",
    "let us now discuss the comparison between the different values of @xmath32 obtained recently . on september 2 , 2014",
    ", althaus studied the case of the 2014 ebola outbreak occurred in guinea , in sierra leone , and in liberia @xcite . in his study , althaus used the who data occurred in the three countries .",
    "he found different values for the basic reproduction number , depending on the country : in guinea @xmath33 , in sierra leone the value of @xmath32 is given by @xmath34 , while in liberia @xmath32 is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "let us now compare between these values and the value for the basic reproduction number studied by kaurov , knowing that his study , which was done on november 4 , 2014 , is more recent than the one of althaus , done september 2 , 2014 .",
    "as the parameters estimated statistically by kaurov are for the three countries , our comparison will be between @xmath36 , the mean of the three basic reproduction numbers found by althaus , and @xmath37 , the number found more recently by kaurov .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is given by @xmath38 , where the more recent @xmath37 is given by @xmath39 .",

    "infectious diseases have tremendous influence on human life . in last decades",
    ", controlling infectious diseases has been an increasingly complex issue . a strategy to control infectious diseases",
    "is through vaccination .",
    "now our idea is to study the effect of vaccination in practical ebola situations .",

    "the time - dependent curve of infected individuals shows that when the percentage of vaccinated individuals increases , the peak of the curve of infected individuals is less important and the period of infection ( the corresponding number of days ) is shorter while the number of recovered gets more important .",
    "in fact , in case of infection without vaccination , the curve of the infected group goes to zero in about 90 days ( see figure  [ sir_vac_simul1 ] ) , where in the presence of vaccination the curve of the infected group goes to zero in about 45 days ( see figure  [ sir_vac_simul2 ] ) .",
