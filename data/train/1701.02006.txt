    ". in particular , such flexible and efficient way to control external pumping laser may generate fascinating topological defects dynamically which properties depend on the way how to manipulate the pumping laser .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] shows the phase profile of each circular component of condensed polariton under shifting the linearly polarized lasers in the middle site . in such case , shifted laser is linearly polarized which means each circular component of condensed polariton experience a equally pumping source mainly originated from @xmath161 in the eq .",

    "<S> we show that how to support propagation of spin degree in a spin - symmetric exciton - polariton condensates in a semiconductor microcavity . due to the stimulated spin - dependent scattering between hot excitons and condensates , exciton polaritons form a circular polarized condensate with spontaneous breaking the spin rotation symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the spin antiferromagnetic state are developed evidently from the density and spin flow pumped by localized laser source . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy spin current is identified where the steady state is characterized by the oscillating spin pattern . </S>",
    "<S> we predict via simulation that it is very promising to dynamical creation of fractionalized half - quantum vortices induced by effective non - abelian gauge potential within currently experiment procedure . </S>"
