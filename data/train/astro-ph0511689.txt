    "it has been known that the iras point source catalog ( psc ) is incomplete in the galactic - center area , and in the strip ( the iras gap ) , which traces a great circle almost perpendicular to the galactic plane at @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cataloged source densities in these areas are apparently lower than those in the surrounding regions . because past maser surveys , especially sio maser surveys , were often made based on the iras psc ( for example , @xcite ) , some important objects may have been left unobserved .",
    "a lack of maser surveys in these areas caused an incompleteness in the sio maser statistics of galactic - plane sources ( for example , @xcite ) . in the area near the galactic center",
    ", an effort has been made to fill the unsurveyed area ( @xcite ) by selecting large - amplitude variables identified in infrared bands ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the situation has now been changed owing to the msx survey ( @xcite ) , which cataloged middle - infrared ( mir ) sources in the iras - incomplete regions .",
    "it covered the whole galactic plane with @xmath6 , and partially the iras - gap area .",
    "furthermore , the 2mass catalog ( @xcite ) became available for selecting mass - losing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) candidate stars , which are suitable for maser searches .    in this paper , we present the result of an sio maser search of iras - missing bright objects in the galactic plane , and objects in the iras - gap area near @xmath7",
    ". furthermore , we studied the nature of oh 1612 mhz sources in the galactic plane in the near- and middle - infrared bands .",
    "this work was originally motivated by an accidental detection of sio masers at the 10@xmath8-offset position of iras 18268@xmath41117 ( = oh 020.433@xmath400.344 ) , where no corresponding infrared object was found at the time of the detection in 2001 march ( a short summary of this detection was given in appendix 1 ) .",
    "therefore , we planned to search for sio maser sources without near- or middle - ir counterparts . however , gradual releases of the 2mass catalog and the msx5c/6c catalogs enabled us to identify the above source as a faint mir object .",
    "we made sensitive near- and middle - ir imaging observations for a few selected maser sources to check whether or not these sources have counterparts in the relevant infrared bands .",
    "we found near- and middle - ir counterparts for all of the sio - detected sources .",
    "we found that there are several oh 1612 mhz sources having no near- and middle - ir counterpart .",
    "we describe the results of these observations and discuss the nature of the odd maser sources without near- or middle - ir detections .",
    "observations in the sio @xmath90 @xmath10 and 2 maser lines around 43 ghz were made with the nobeyama 45-m telescope during the periods in 2001 march  april and 2002 february  may .",
    "some additional observations were made in 2004 may and 2005 january  february , after the msx6cg catalog out of the galactic plane was available . a cooled sis - mixer receiver ( s40 ) with a bandwidth of about 0.4 ghz",
    "were used , and the system temperature ( including atmospheric noise ) was 200300 k ( ssb ) , depending on the frequency and weather .",
    "the aperture efficiency of the telescope at 43 ghz was 0.5 .",
    "the antenna temperature given in the present paper was corrected for atmospheric absorption and telescope ohmic loss , but not for the beam or aperture efficiency ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the conversion factor of the antenna temperature to the flux density is about 2.9 jy k@xmath12 .",
    "acousto - optical spectrometer arrays of both high and low resolutions ( aos - h and aos - w ) with 40 and 250 mhz bandwidths , respectively , were used , giving velocity coverages of about @xmath13 km s@xmath12 and spectral resolutions of 0.3 km s@xmath12 ( per two binned channels ) .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked using strong sio maser sources , irc@xmath410414 and v1111 oph , and the pointing accuracy was confirmed to be better than 5@xmath14 in a windless condition .",
    "observations were made in a position - switching mode , and the off - position was chosen to be 10@xmath8 away from the object in right ascension .",
    "the total on - source integration time was typically 10 min .",
    "we also observed several sources in the h@xmath15o maser line at 22.235 ghz using a hemt ( h22 ) receiver .",
    "this was made mainly as a backup observation in bad weather .",
    "the aperture efficiency at this frequency was 0.62 ; the conversion factor to the antenna temperature was 3 jy k@xmath12 .",
    "the hpbw was 73@xmath14 .",
    "the system temperature at 22 ghz varied between 180400 k , depending on the weather .",
    "the line parameters of sio detections are given in table 1 and the rms noise levels of non - detections are given in table 2 .",
    "the infrared properties of the observed sources are summarized in table 3 , listing the 2mass name , @xmath2 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 magnitudes , msx 6c name , separation from the 2mass positions , flux density in c band ( 12.3 @xmath3 m ) , colors @xmath18 [ @xmath19 and @xmath20 [ @xmath21 , and nearby iras source name within @xmath22 , and separation in arcsec .",
    "we selected two types of objects : one from 2mass nir objects with no iras ( or very faint msx ) counterpart , and another from oh 1612 mhz sources without iras or msx counterpart .",
    "in addition , we observed bright msx sources without iras identifications near the galctic plane , especially in the iras gap - area .",
    "we selected the observing candidates using the 2mass gator by the @xmath23 color and the @xmath2 magnitude ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "it was checked whether or not the selected candidates had iras or msx(5c ) counterparts ; the stars that had an iras or msx counterpart within 20@xmath14 ( a radius of hpbw of the 45-m telescope ) were removed from the list .",
    "we observed 32 objects from this sample .",
    "the positions of the observed sources and their near - infrared ( nir ) properties are listed in table 3 with `` @xmath26 '' after the 2mass name in the first column .",
    "because of a software bug of the msx(5c ) imager , which was used for source selection , the objects listed in table 3 are not perfectly consistent with the above condition .",
    "however , all of the objects have very low mir flux densities .",
    "another type of object without mir counterparts is a subsample of oh 1612 mhz sources in the galactic disk ( @xmath27 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these sources were detected with vla , and the positions are known within a few arcsec accuracy .",
    "the assignments to the nearest iras / msx/2mass sources were made by @xcite .",
    "a considerable number of the objects have iras / msx counterparts at positions beyond 3 sigma of the iras / msx - position uncertainties . because the assignments to the msx sources by sevenster et al.s ( 2001 ) work were made before the software - bug correction of the msx imager",
    ", we again checked whether they really have no msx counterpart .",
    "finally , we chose 10 oh 1612 mhz objects with no iras nor msx counterpart ( except oh 006.095@xmath400.630 , 013.379 + 00.050 , and 014.431@xmath400.033 , which were included in the sample before the software bug correction ) .",
    "the positions and properties of these oh objects are summarized in table 4 , listing the oh name , positions , the center velocity of oh double peaks , the outflow velocity , the msx6c source name , the flux density at the a band , the separation from the oh position , the nearest iras source name ( and separation in arcminute between the parentheses ) , and the object type .",
    "we detected sio maser emission in oh 006.095@xmath400.630 , and h@xmath15o in oh 28.397 + 0.080 .",
    "the sio and h@xmath15o spectra for these two objects are shown at the bottom of figure 1b .",
    "weak water maser emission in oh 28.397 + 0.080 can be seen on the lower velocity side ( @xmath2860 km s@xmath12 ) of the main peak at @xmath29",
    "km s@xmath12 .",
    "the nature of these objects is discussed in sections 4.2 and 4.3 .",
    "the iras gap area of ( @xmath30 , @xmath31)@xmath32(80@xmath3388@xmath33 , @xmath346@xmath33 ) is an easily accessible region of the sky from nobeyama .",
    "however , past sio maser surveys ( @xcite ) did not involve objects in this region .",
    "the msx survey was mainly restricted to the galactic plane ( @xmath6 ) , except for a few areas out of the galactic plane , which was cataloged as `` high latitude , @xmath35 '' in msx 6c . from the msx catalog",
    ", we selected mir sources above the 5 jy at band c ( 12.13 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "because the msx survey did not cover the 60 @xmath3 m band , source selections were made simply based on a condition for the logarithmic flux - density ratio , @xmath36 log(@xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the flux densities at band c ( 12.13 @xmath3 m ) and band e ( 21.3 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "the logarithmic flux - density ratio , @xmath20 , is very similar to the iras color , @xmath40 , which is the logarithmic ratio of the iras 25 to 12 @xmath3 m flux - density .",
    "the positions and mir properties of the observed sources are listed in table 3 ( without `` @xmath26 '' in the first column ) . because most of these objects have 2mass nir counterparts , we designated the objects by the 2mass counterpart names .",
    "we also observed msx objects with iras counterparts and a few bright miras in the same sky area for completeness ; these objects have colors of agb stars and were not observed before .",
    "we detected sio masers 39 out of 86 objects in msx sources near the galactic plane , or 26 out of 62 in the iras gap region of @xmath41 .",
    "the results are also given in tables 1 and 2 . because these objects are mostly bright mir objects , discussions on the overall properties of these sources are given in appendix 2 .",
    "one of the most interesting objects among sio detections is a symbiotic star , j21020980 + 4546329 ( = v407 cyg ; @xcite ) .",
    "this star has been known to be similar to oh / ir sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it seems to have escaped from past sensitive maser - line searches because of not being included in the iras psc , except for a few negative results ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of sio masers in the present work indicates that this is a star similar to another symbiotic star with sio masers , r aqr .",
    "near - infrared imaging observations for the oh 1612 mhz objects were made during 2001 august 2527 with the 88-inch telescope of university of hawaii , at mauna kea , hawaii , using the nir array camera , called sirius ( simultaneous - color infrared imager for unbiased survey ) .",
    "the infrared array camera had 1024@xmath421024 pixels ( hgcdte ) with a resolution of @xmath43 per pixel , and obtained the @xmath0- ( 1.25 @xmath3 m ) , @xmath1- ( 1.63 @xmath3 m ) , and @xmath2-band ( 2.14 @xmath3 m ; in fact , @xmath44 ) images simultaneously .",
    "this camera was developed by the sirius team at nagoya university for a southern sky survey with the 1.4-m infrared telescope at southerland , south africa .",
    "it was temporarily installed to the uh 88-inch telescope for a joint uh  nao ( national astronomical observatory ) project .",
    "a detailed description of this camera can be found in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "@xmath45-band images for programmed objects were taken with an exposure time of 30 s at two dithering positions in order to subtract the sky background .",
    "the data reductions were made by a standard data - reduction procedure with the iraf package , subtracting the dark frames , dividing by the sky background , and subtracting the sky - field .",
    "then , @xmath45 color - composite images were created .",
    "objects with `` red '' colors were searched in the color - composite images .",
    "these objects normally fall within the regions @xmath46 and @xmath47 on a nir two - color diagram ; we have long experience of identifying oh / sio objects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric results for oh sources are summarized in table 5 , listing the source name ; the positions of the identified star in j2000 ; the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 magnitudes ; and whether or not sio / h@xmath15o is detected , and whether or not the source is recognizable on the msx imager .",
    "we identified 5 nir counterparts near the oh positions ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "however , for the other 4 objects , we could not find any counterparts .",
    "for the case of oh 006.095@xmath400.650 , a very faint red star was detected ( only in @xmath2 band ) near the oh position ( within 2@xmath14 ) . however , because of the faintness ( and probably due to time variation and sensitivity ) , this star is not seen on the corresponding 2mass @xmath2-band image .",
    "middle - infrared observations were made on 2002 july 29 using the subaru 8.2-m telescope of national astronomical observatory of japan at mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the mir camera , comics ( cooled mid - infrared camera and spectrometer ) , was mounted on the cassegrain offset focus .",
    "this camera has a @xmath48 si : as detector array , and it was optimized for @xmath49- and @xmath50-band observations .",
    "the camera provided a field of view of @xmath51 with the pixel scale of @xmath52 .",
    "the details of this camera are described in @xcite , or the subaru instrumental home page.http://subarutelescope.org/observing/instruments/comics@xmath53    observations were made in the chopping mode by a second mirror for background subtraction at a 30@xmath14 offset position .",
    "in addition , dithering of about 5@xmath14 was also introduced . these techniques to subtract the sky background reduced the noise by about @xmath54 compared with simple staring .",
    "we used a camera with 3 filters [ n8.8 ( 8.78 @xmath3 m with a band width of 0.77 @xmath3 m ) , n9.8 ( 9.73@xmath3 m with a band width of 0.94 @xmath3 m ) , and n12.5 ( 12.41@xmath3 m with a band width of 1.15 @xmath3 m ) ] , with exposure times of a few to 30 s. the flux standard stars ( hd 161096 , hd 168723 , hd 169916 etc . )",
    "were observed as a flux calibration .",
    "the seeing size of a point source was typically @xmath55 at 12.4 @xmath3 m .",
    "the raw data were reduced using a software package developed by the comics team , with subtracting the dithering images and dividing by sky - flats .",
    "we used the iraf package for aperture photometry . because we normally detected only one source in the field and it was near the center of the field , the photometry was extremely simple .",
    "we used an aperture having a radius of 6 pixels , and integrated all of the emission inside . to determine the sky background emission",
    ", we took the average count between two radii of 20 and 30 pixels from the star and subtracted the average from the count in the aperture . for nondetections , we measured the level of the blank sky at several different positions in the same manner as above and gave the upper limit of the signal as 3-times the rms value of the counts .",
    "two exposures in each band were normally made for one object .",
    "the average flux densities calculated from these exposures are given in table 6 .",
    "the errors in the flux densities were estimated from the difference of the flux densities in two exposures , and were expected to be about 0.1 jy . the absolute flux densities were obtained by comparing the flux densities with those of the standard stars at nearly the same elevation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the q - band imaging observations at 24.5 @xmath3 m became available with subaru comics after the 2003 first semester .",
    "therefore , additional imaging observations were made at 24.5 @xmath3 m on 2003 july 15 as a service observation . at this time",
    ", we chose 5 objects that were not detected ( or marginally deteted ) before in the other bands .",
    "the data reduction was made in the same way as described before .",
    "the rms noise level was about 0.5 jy .",
    "we detected only oh 18.381 + 00.162 at 24.5 @xmath3 m .",
    "the results are summarized in table 6 ; the source name , observed flux densities at 8.7 , 9.7 , 12.4 , and 24.5 @xmath3 m , the dust color temperature ( @xmath56 ) , the color ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath2-band extinction ( @xmath57 ) , estimated luminosity distance ( @xmath58 ) , and kinematic distance ( @xmath59 ) are given .",
    "the dust color temperature was computed from a flux density ratio of 12.4 to 8.7 @xmath3 m assuming a black body ; the color , @xmath40 [ @xmath60 log(@xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the flux densities at 12 and 25 @xmath3 m ] , was computed from the dust color temperature ( of 8.7 and 12.4 @xmath3 m ) assuming that the dust emits black body radiation at 25 @xmath3 m .",
    "the kinematic distance was estimated from the oh radial velocity , assuming a flat rotation curve of 220 km s@xmath12 and a sun  g.c .",
    "distance of 8 kpc .",
    "as far as the color temperatures ( or @xmath40 ) are concerned , the stars that were detected at 8.7 and 12.4 @xmath3 m were not different from typical oh / sio maser sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2-band interstellar extinction and the distance were estimated using the same formula as that of @xcite , assuming the extinction law in the exponential - disk model in the galaxy and a constant stellar luminosity of @xmath64 of the central star .",
    "in the case of j18301610@xmath41115376 , the msx catalog gives flux densities of 1.72 and 2.10 jy at 8 and 12 @xmath3 m , respectively ( for msx6c_g020.5138@xmath400.4885 ) . in the case of oh 006.095@xmath400.630",
    ", the msx catalog gives flux densities of 1.59 and 2.48 jy at 8 and 12 @xmath3 m , respectively ( for msx6c_g006.0952@xmath400.6294 ) .",
    "the observed values were roughly 2030% larger than the flux densities given in the msx catalog for these sources .",
    "however , because the mir fluxes of pulsating stars are variable ( for example , @xcite ) , the differences can be attributed to the time variation .",
    "we conclude that they coincide reasonably well with the previously measured flux densities for these two stars .",
    "in this section , we discuss the properties of the nir and oh 1612 mhz sources . because the properties of msx sources in the area of @xmath65 are quite similar to the normal iras agb objects , we give a discussion on them separately in appendix 2 .",
    "figure 3 shows two - color and magnitude  color diagrams for the observed 32 2mass objects with no iras or a faint msx counterpart ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we can recognize that the distributions of the sampled stars in these diagrams are quite similar to those of the corresponding diagrams of sio detected objects in the galactic disk and bulge ( @xcite , 2002 , and 2004b ) , except that the @xmath2 magnitudes of the present sample are about 0.5 magnitude on average higher ( fainter ) than those of the outer bulge objects .",
    "this fact indicates that the sampled nir objects are approximately 8 kpc or more away from the sun .",
    "the two objects detected in sio are relatively bright compared with the other nondetection stars , indicating that they are relatively close to the sun ( @xmath67 kpc ) .",
    "the mir flux densities of these objects seem to indicate that they have a smaller mass - loss rate than those of the average sio maser stars in the galactic disk / bulge do .",
    "therefore , the sio detection rate of these stars is considerably lower than that of the iras sources in the disk , partly due to their distances .",
    "the other reason for the low detection rate is attributed to the fact that this sample involves the rgb or agb stars without mass loss , because the sampling of nir stars was governed only by the nir colors .",
    "figure 4 shows the observed spectra of the detected sources between 1.25 and 12.4 @xmath3 m .",
    "the upper panel shows the spectra of near - ir sources with sio , and the lower panel shows the spectra of oh 1612 mhz sources .",
    "it has been well known that the silicate dust has an emission / absorption band at 9.8 @xmath3 m .",
    "the silicate band exhibits emission at 9.8 @xmath3 m when the circumstellar envelope is optically thin , and an absorption when it is optically thick [ for example , see @xcite ] .",
    "the absorption feature is recognizable for some sources in figure 4 ( clearly in oh 006.095@xmath400.630 ) .",
    "however , the emission feature is not very clearly recognized in figure 4 ( except a slight enhancement in oh 031.985@xmath400.177 ) .",
    "this is probably because the emission feature at 9.8 @xmath3 m is smeared because of the wide band width ( @xmath320.94 @xmath3 m ) of the n9.8 filter .",
    "in contrast , the absorption feature can be wide , and most of the oh sources exhibit the 9.8 @xmath3 m absorption except oh 031.985@xmath400.177 .    in figure 4 , the near - ir sources with sio masers exhibit flat spectra between 2.2 and 12.4 @xmath3 m .",
    "the circumstellar envelopes of these sources are relatively thin .",
    "oh 013.510@xmath400.578 exhibits a relatively flat spectrum , except for a weak absorption feature at 9.8 @xmath3 m .",
    "this source is probably a star similar to the near - ir objects with relatively thin envelopes , but it must be located far ( by a factor of 3 compared with near - ir sources ) .",
    "it has been known that the oh 1612 mhz masers are occasionally found in star - forming regions , accompanying the dominant oh 1665/1667 mhz masers [ for example , @xcite ] .",
    "the positions of these main- and satellite - line masers usually coincide within a few arcsec accuracy .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that at least 7 of the 1612 mhz sources ( mostly single - peak spectra except one ) that were found by @xcite are associated with star - forming regions . among them , the object , oh 5.885@xmath40.392 , has a doubly peaked spectrum with a separation of 40 km s@xmath12 , exhibiting a stronger 1612 mhz ( peak ) flux density than the 1665 mhz flux density .",
    "because of the association with a continuum source , this object is considered to be a star - forming region ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xcite discussed 5 oh 1612 mhz sources [ in table 2 of @xcite ] , which are seen toward , but are not associated with , star - forming regions ; all of these have iras or msx counterparts with reasonable @xmath40 colors as evolved stars .",
    "the 2mass images show only one clear nir counterpart ( oh 331.646@xmath40.259 ) , but no or a dubious red candidate for the other 4 objects .",
    "one object , oh 331.594@xmath40.135 , has no iras , msx , or 2mass counterpart .    these examples tell us that , even if we can not find any nir counterpart for a particular object , we should often find the mir counterpart if it is an evolved star ( in agb or post - agb phase ) . if not , they may be a star - forming region . a mir and nir diagnostics , as well as",
    "that using the oh main line ( 1665/1667 mhz ) and sio masers , is crucial for judging whether the object is an evolved star or a star - forming region , and is useful for precluding non - agb stars from oh radial - velocity samples in the galactic disk ( @xcite ) .    in the present sample of oh 1612 mhz objects , sio masers",
    "are detected only in oh 006.095@xmath400.630 .",
    "the presence of the nir and mir counterparts secures that this object is an evolved star .",
    "as far as we find the bright nir counter parts , as for oh 013.379 + 00.050 , 013.510@xmath400.578 , 014.431@xmath400.033 , and 031.985@xmath400.177 , they are likely to be evolved stars .",
    "furthermore , the nir counterparts of these oh objects do not accompany any star - forming activities , such as nebulous features and a cluster of faint red stars , which are often associated with star - forming regions . on the other hand , for",
    "the other 5 oh 1612 mhz objects for which neighther nir nor mir counterparts are found ( except oh 18.381 + 00.162 ) , they are possibly oh maser sources in star - forming regions .",
    "two sources , oh 018.381 + 00.162 and 032.731@xmath400.327 , are relatively strong 1612 mhz emission sources among the sampled oh sources : about 4 jy km s@xmath12 for the blue shifted components of the double peaks .",
    "the expansion velocities are about 9 and 15 km s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "since the oh peak flux density is roughly correlated with the iras 25 @xmath3 m flux density ( @xcite ) , we estimate that the 25 @xmath3 m flux densities of these sources must be about 1560 jy if they are agb stars .",
    "the weakness of the 12 @xmath3 m emission of these objects indicates @xmath68 .",
    "the positions of oh 018.381 + 00.162 were measured using vla ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and both positions coincide well with the later measurement ( @xcite ) with an error of @xmath69 .",
    "fix and mutel ( 1984 ) found that the oh emission of oh 018.381 + 00.162 was not resolved with vla and gave the lower limit of the distance , 7 kpc .",
    "water maser searches for this star have been negative ( @xcite ; the present study ) .",

    "a steep increase of the intensity beyond 12 @xmath3 m ( @xmath71 ) indicates that this object is at the phase of proto - planetary nebulae .",
    "the distance of this source was estimated to be 5.5 kpc from nir photometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "if oh sources without nir / mir counterparts , oh 018.381 + 00.162 and oh 032.731@xmath400.327 , are located as distant as 11 kpc , 2-times the oh 037.1@xmath40.8 distance , the 12 @xmath3 m flux density would be about 0.6 jy , which is close to the detection limit of subaru comics .",
    "in fact , oh 018.381 + 00.162 , was detected at 0.61 jy at 12.4 @xmath3 m , and 3.5 jy at 24.5 @xmath3 m in the present work ( see table 6 ) .",
    "the msx imager gave a slight enhancement of signal on the d- and e - band ( 14 and 21 @xmath3 m ) images at this position .",
    "these facts are consistent with the estimated distance of about 11 kpc for oh 018.381 + 00.162 . for oh 032.731@xmath400.327 ,",
    "we found no enhancement of emission on the msx a ",
    "e - band images at the oh position .",
    "therefore , it is more difficult to estimate the distance .",
    "because the envelope expansion velocities of these two sources ( @xmath72 and 14 km s@xmath12 ) are as moderate as that of an agb star , the mass losses of these two sources are relatively mild .",
    "@xcite argued that cold oh / ir sources with @xmath73 have a luminosity of @xmath74 and a mass below 4 @xmath75 , and that they are less luminous and less massive than those in the bluer region , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in the two - color diagram .",
    "the distribution of these cold oh / ir objects at the left side of the black body curve in the two - color diagram seems to be fitted by a model of 3 @xmath75 without dust formation in the post - agb phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "the models without dust - formation in the post - agb phase seem to be consistent with the nondetection of sio masers in these sources .",
    "the detectability of the central star in the @xmath2 band may strongly depend on the sphericity of the envelope in the post - agb phase .",
    "if a collimated high - velocity flow is developed and a hollow is created , the nir photons can escape through the hollow . in this sense",
    ", @xmath2-band detection would be a measure of sphericity of the envelope .",
    "the color , @xmath78 $ ] , in the models of @xcite for cold objects falls between 410 , where [ 12 ] is the 12 @xmath3 m magnitude [ @xmath602.5  log(@xmath79 ) ] .",
    "the 12 @xmath3 m magnitude is estimated to be nearly 5.2 ( or larger ) for these two oh sources .",
    "because these sources were not detected in the @xmath2-band observations , we estimate @xmath78 $ ] to be about 10 for these sources .",
    "our findings given in this paper is consistent with sevenster s conjecture ( @xcite ) that the cold objects are more or less evolved to elliptical planetary nebulae , rather than bipolar planetaries .",
    "we found that the oh source , oh 028.397 + 00.080 , has no nir and mir counterpart , though a relatively strong h@xmath80o emission was found in the present work .",
    "note that the 1612 mhz spectrum shows only a single peak at @xmath81 km s@xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "here , we speculate on a few nearby objects that have been found around this oh source .",
    "an msx point source , msx6c _ g028.3937 + 00.0757 ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , j2000.0 ) , is located about 20@xmath14 southeast of oh 028.397 + 00.080 .",
    "this msx source is deduced to be the same as iras 18402@xmath40403 ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , j2000.0 ) , where the iras flux densities at 12 and 25 @xmath3 m , 1.2 and 16.4 jy , correlates well with those of msx , respectively .",
    "the flux densities at 60 and 100 @xmath3 m are 356.3 and 932.3 jy , respectively , which are too large as an evolved object .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of this source indicates that this is a very cool object , such as a young star embedded in a molecular cloud , or a galaxy .",
    "in fact , @xcite found a radio continuum source at almost the same position ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 , j2000.0 ) as that of the msx source ; according to them , this is a gps ( gigahertz peaked spectrum ) radio source .",
    "during mapping of the molecular cloud , g28.34 + 0.06 ( which was found as a silhouette on msx middle - ir images ) , @xcite detected a strong submillimeter - wave point source ( assigned as p2 in their figure 3 ) with jcmt scuba at the position ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , j2000.0 ) .",
    "it is located about 6@xmath14 west of oh 028.397 + 00.080 , indicating a reasonable agreement with the position of oh 028.397 + 00.080 within the errors .",
    "the 850 @xmath3 m map shows considerable complexity of this source .",
    "based on a position difference of about 23@xmath14 , @xcite noted that this source is distinctively different from iras 18402@xmath40403 ( or msx6c _ g028.3937 + 00.0757 ) . from the high flux density ( 48 jy ) at 450 @xmath3 m , they concluded that it is a pre - main - sequence ob star at a distance of @xmath90 kpc .",
    "if this submillimeter - wave source is an agb star embedded in a very thick envelope , the luminosity must be about @xmath91 .",
    "it is also possible that a considerable part of middle- and far - infrared flux densities of the above - mentioned nearby source , iras 18402@xmath40403 ( @xmath92 jy ) , may come from this oh 1612 mhz source .",
    "assuming that half of the 60 @xmath3 m flux of iras 18402@xmath40403 comes from this oh source ( a half from dust clouds toward the same direction ) , we obtain a distance of about 6 kpc from the sun .",
    "the high flux density at 450 @xmath3 m indicates that the dust is considerably opaque at this frequency .",
    "the optical depth of unity at 450 @xmath3 m indicates dust extinction , @xmath93 mag ( equivalent to the column density @xmath94 hi @xmath95 ) .",
    "this value is much larger than the column density @xmath96 hi @xmath95 for ( slightly unusual ) massive hi cloud of @xmath97 ( @xcite ) in this direction .",
    "therefore , we can consider that most of the submillimeter radiation ( and far - ir emission too ) comes from the envelope of this star .",
    "based on the column density and the radius of the black body sphere , @xmath98 cm and @xmath99 k ( which gives 48 jy at 450 @xmath3 m ) , the mass loss rate of the star can be estimated as @xmath100 when we assume an expanding velocity of 30 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this model is considerably extreme as the circumstellar envelope of an o - rich evolved object .",
    "therefore , we conclude here that oh 028.397 + 00.080 is a cool object in a star - forming region , not an evolved star .",
    "we investigated the nature of stars with optically very thin or extremely optically thick dust envelopes in the radio , nir , and mir wavelengths . by sio maser lines",
    ", we detected 44 out of 130 observed objects .",
    "infrared observations for the subset of this sio sample confirmed that about 2/3 of the objects with thick envelopes ( oh 1612 mhz sources ) have nir or mir counterparts .",
    "so far , we have found nir counter parts for all of the sio detected sources .",
    "however , we could not find any nir or mir counterparts for 4 of oh 1612 mhz sources .",
    "these objects must be stars with extremely cold thick envelopes without dust formation in the agb phase , or young objects in star - forming regions .",

    "the subsequent 5-point mapping of this sio emission ( hpbw of 40@xmath14 ) on 2001 april 10 gave the accurate position of this source as ( ra , dec , epoch)= ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 , j2000.0 ) ; the positional accuracy was estimated to be about 5@xmath14 .",
    "we found no iras point source within 2@xmath8 .",
    "we also checked all of the known optical , infrared and oh 1612 mhz objects in the simbad database , and found no candidate for this source .",
    "a subsequent near - ir imaging observation at this position was kindly made by p. wood with the anu 2.3-m telescope on 2001 june .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath2-band images showed a bright - red star at ( ra , dec , epoch)= ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 , j2000.0 ) . because of the brightness at the @xmath2-band , @xmath105 mag and the @xmath23 color , @xmath106 mag , it must be , without doubt , a near - ir counterpart of the above sio maser source .",
    "we designated this object as j18301610@xmath41115376 for the 2mass corresponding object , after 2mass data was released .",
    "the msx catalog listed a source , msx5c_g020.5046@xmath400.4779 ( 0.5 jy in band a [ 8.8 @xmath3 m ] , but not detected in the other bands ) , which is located about 45@xmath14 south of the sio position .",
    "this source is too weak and can not be a strong sio maser source as above . for confirmation , we observed this source ( = j18301278@xmath41115463=msx6c_g020.5053@xmath400.4777 in table 2 and 3 ) in the sio @xmath90 @xmath10 and 2 transitions on 2001 april 10 ; no emission stronger than 0.08 k was detected .",
    "meanwhile , it turned out that the original msx catalog and image server ( ver",
    ". 1 ) had a software bug , and did not list some faint objects below a few jy .",
    "the msx image server and overlays ( ver .",
    "2)http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu / applications / msx/ @xmath107 .",
    "] gave msx6c_g020.5138@xmath400.4885 at ( ra , dec , epoch)=(18@xmath108 , @xmath109 , j2000.0 ) with 2.2 jy in band c ( 12.5 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "this msx source is located about 4@xmath14 se of above sio position , and therefore , we believe this is a mir counterpart of the above - mentioned sio maser source .",
    "we detected 26 among 62 2mass / msx sources observed in sio maser lines in the region of @xmath41 , where the iras survey was incomplete .",
    "the sio detection rate is about 42 percent , which is slightly smaller than the sio detection rates in the previous bulge / disk sio surveys ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 5 shows histograms of 12 @xmath3 m ( band c ) flux densities , @xmath62 and the colors , @xmath20 , for the observed objects .",
    "the solid line in these figures indicates the sio detection rate in each bin .",
    "the detection rate looks nearly constant over log(@xmath110 ) , except at low and high flux - density limits where the statistical significance is poor .",
    "the detection rate tends to increase with decreasing @xmath20 .",
    "however , this is probably due to a deficiency of high @xmath20 objects in this galactic - longitude area compared with objects in the inner - galaxy areas ( for instance , see @xcite ) .",
    "it has been known that the sio detection rate of iras sources drops at large @xmath20 ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "though classification of the msx sources have been made ( @xcite ) , comparisons between the msx and iras sources , especially for sources with the colors of agb stars , have not been investigated well .",
    "@xcite discussed that the sio maser detection rate is correlated with the msx band a ( 8 @xmath3 m ) , because the sio molecule has the fundamental vibration band at around 8 @xmath3 m .",
    "the detection rate in the present sample was comparable with those expected at this longitude range .",
    "@xcite discussed that the sio detection rate for the iras sample decreases with the galactocentric distance .",
    "for example , it was 13% for the sources in @xmath111250@xmath33 , and 42% for the sources in @xmath11290@xmath33 .",
    "they concluded that the contamination rate by c - rich or young stars in the flux - limited sample increases with the galactic longitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present sio maser search gave a detection rate similar to the previous one made in the region of @xmath11290@xmath33 .",
    "a small improvement for the source selection was made in the present sio search , because the positions of the msx sources are more accurately known than those of the iras psc sample and the agb nature of the sources was more or less confirmed by the presence of any nir counterpart on the 2mass images near the msx position .",
    "we conclude that these criteria result in a somewhat flat detection rate with the flux density .",
    "the average and the standard deviation of the radial velocities of 23 msx sources detected in the @xmath113 area are @xmath114 and 25.3 km s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "because these sources are located in the narrow range of @xmath115 where the area is nearly tangential to the direction of the galactic center , the effect of galactic rotation on the radial velocity becomes negligible in a range of the distance below 4 kpc [ see figure 8 of @xcite ] .",
    "the obtained value of the radial velocity dispersion , 25.3 km s@xmath12 , is insensitive to the source distances .",
    "therefore , it is more accurate than the values obtained before for these sio emitting objects .",
    "for example , velocity disperions of @xmath3230 km s@xmath12 were obtained for the southern sio maser sources in the solar neighbourhood ( @xcite ) .",
