    "although the observations of filaments within molecular clouds have been reported since decades ( e.g. schneider & elmegreen 1979 ) , only recently their presence has been recognized as a unique characteristic of the star - formation process .",
    "the latest herschel results have revealed the direct connection between the filaments , dense cores and stars in all kinds of environments along the milky way , from low - mass and nearby clouds ( andr et al .",

    "if the estimated linear mass of an observed filament is larger than the value obtained for the ostriker filament ( @xmath0 16.6 m@xmath1 pc@xmath2 for t=10 k ) , it is assumed that the filament is unstable .",
    "analogously , density profiles flatter than the ostriker profile are generally interpreted as a a sign of collapse .",
    "however , it is worth recalling the assumptions and limitations of this model : @xmath3 filaments are assumed to be isothermal , @xmath4 they are not rotating , @xmath5 they are isolated , @xmath6 they can be modeled as cylindrical structures with infinite length , @xmath7 their support against gravity comes solely from thermal pressure .",
    "an increasing number of observational results suggest however that none of the above assumptions can be considered as strictly valid . in a first paper ( recchi et al .",

    "since the first millimeter studies in nearby clouds it is well known that star - forming filaments present complex motions both parallel and perpendicular to their main axis ( e.g. loren 1989 ; uchida et al .",
    "recently , hacar & tafalla ( 2011 ) have shown that the internal dynamical structure of the so - called velocity coherent filaments is dominated by the presence of local motions , typically characterized by velocity gradients of the order of 1.52.0 km  s@xmath2",
    "pc@xmath2 , similar to those found inside dense cores ( e.g. caselli et al .",
    "2002 ) . comparing the structure of both density and velocity perturbations along the main axis of different filaments , hacar & tafalla ( 2011 ) identified the periodicity of different longitudinal modes as the streaming motions leading to the formation of dense cores within these objects .",
    "these authors also noticed the presence of distinct and non - parallel components with similar amplitudes than their longitudinal counterparts .",
    "interpreted as rotational modes , these perpendicular motions would correspond to a maximum angular frequency @xmath8 of about 6.5  @xmath9 10@xmath10 s@xmath2 . assuming these values as characteristic defining the rotational frequency in galactic filaments ,",
    "the detection of such rotational levels then rises the question on whether they could potentially influence the stability of these objects . with the plane of the sky",
    ", an observed radial velocity gradient @xmath11 corresponds to a real gradient that is @xmath12 times larger than that . ]    to estimate the dynamical relevance of rotation we can take the total kinetic energy per unit length as equal to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the external radius of the cylinder and @xmath15 its linear mass .",
    "the total gravitational energy per unit mass is @xmath16 , hence the ratio @xmath17 is @xmath18 clearly , for nominal values of @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the total kinetic energy associated to rotation is significant , thus rotation is dynamically important .",
    "in order to calculate the density distribution of rotating , non - isothermal filaments , we extend the approach already used in paper i , which we shortly repeat here .",

    "this expression is more convenient than classical lane - emden type equations ( see e.g. robe 1968 ; hansen et al .",

    "[ eq : basic ] , we can obtain equilibrium solutions for isothermal , uniformly rotating filaments .",
    "we have checked that our numerical results reproduce the main features of this kind of cylinders , already known in the literature , namely :    * density inversions take place for @xmath38 as the centrifugal , gravitational and pressure gradient forces battle to maintain mechanical equilibrium .",
    "density oscillations occur in other equilibrium distributions of polytropes ( see horedt 2004 for a very comprehensive overview ) .",
    "noticeably , the equilibrium solution of uniformly rotating cylindrical polytropes with polytropic index @xmath39 depends on the ( oscillating ) zeroth - order bessel function @xmath40 ( robe 1968 ; see also christodoulou & kazanas 2007 ) .",
    "solutions for rotating cylindrical polytropes with @xmath41 maintain this oscillating character although they can not be expressed analytically . as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : denrot ] , in the case of isothermal cylinders ( corresponding to @xmath42 ) , the frequency of oscillations is zero for @xmath32 , corresponding to the ostriker profile .",
    "this frequency increases with the angular frequency @xmath24 . * for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , due to the fact that , in this case , the effective gravity @xmath45 is directed outwards . for @xmath46 , @xmath47 . if @xmath48 , there is perfect equilibrium between centrifugal and gravitational forces ( keplerian rotation ) and the density is constant ( see also inagaki & hachisu 1978 ) .",
    "* the density tends asymptotically to the value @xmath49 .",
    "this implies also that the integrated mass per unit length @xmath50 diverges for @xmath38 .",
    "rotating filaments must be thus pressure truncated .",
    "this limit of @xmath51 for large values of @xmath30 is essentially the reason why density oscillations arise for @xmath52 .",
    "this limit can not be reached smoothly , i.e. the density gradient can not tend to zero .",
    "if the density gradient tends to zero , so does the pressure gradient . in this case",
    "there must be asymptotically a perfect equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force ( keplerian rotation ) but , as we have noticed above , this equilibrium is possible only if @xmath48 .",
    "thanks to the density oscillations , @xmath53 does not tend to zero and perfect keplerian rotation is never attained .",

    "] as can be seen there , the linear mass of a rotating filament could easily exceed the critical linear mass of its ostriker - like counterpart without being necessary unstable .",
    "it is also instructive to obtain estimations of the above models in physical units in order to interpret observations in nearby clouds . for typical filaments similar to those found in taurus ( hacar & tafalla 2011 ;",

    "clearly , the law @xmath79 displays a radial profile with even stronger oscillations than the model with uniform rotation . as mentioned above",
    ", oscillations are prone to dynamical instabilities . in this case , instabilities start occurring at the minimum of the density distribution , here located at @xmath80 .",
    "conversely , these density oscillations are suppressed in rotating filaments that obey a law like @xmath81 .",
    "it is however worth noticing that this last rotational law fails to satisfy the solberg - hiland criterion for stability against axisymmetric perturbations ( tassoul 1978 ; endal & sofia 1978 ; horedt 2004 )",

    "it is easy to see that also the asymptotically constant law fulfils this condition if the angular frequency is constant .",
    "figure  [ fig : denlinrot ] also shows that density oscillations are damped in the presence of positive temperature gradients .",
    "this was expected as more pressure is provided to the external layers to contrast the effect of the centrifugal force . since density inversions are dynamically unstable , positive temperature gradients must be thus seen as a stabilizing mechanism in filaments .",

    "as it is well known , if we assume that the filament extends until infinite distances , then the column density is : @xmath129 however , the cylinder could be embedded in a more extended cloud , with radius @xmath130 . if we take for simplicity the cloud aligned with the filament , the situation is shown in fig .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate how the equilibrium structure of a filament changes in a rotating configuration . to do so </S>",
    "<S> , we solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equation assuming both uniform and differential rotations independently . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a new set of equilibrium solutions for rotating and pressure truncated filaments . </S>",
    "<S> these new equilibrium solutions are found to present both radial and projected column density profiles shallower than their ostriker - like counterparts . moreover , and for rotational periods similar to those found in the observations , the centrifugal forces present in these filaments are also able to sustain large amounts of mass ( larger than the mass attained by the ostriker filament ) without being necessary unstable . </S>",
