    "polluted white dwarfs provide an opportunity to investigate the ultimate fate of planetary systems .",
    "@xcite show that under the right conditions , some planets do manage to survive the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post - agb phases , while @xcite had already shown that these planets and asteroids could find themselves within the white dwarf tidal radius if their orbits become unstable during close encounters with each other .",
    "the formation of debris discs around white dwarfs may be a common occurrence @xcite and is most likely related to the presence of a crowded circumstellar environment in the parent star .",
    "the presence of debris material accreted onto the white dwarf surface is evident in spectroscopic observations of a large fraction of hydrogen - rich white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the origin of magnetic fields in white dwarf stars may be linked to possible field - generating merger events preceding the birth of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of such mergers during the post - agb phase would be directly related to the multiplicity in their respective stellar or planetary systems : surface metallicity and magnetic field in white dwarfs may be concomitant .",
    "recent investigations have uncovered several cool , magnetic , polluted da white dwarfs @xcite . because the initial class identifications were secured with low - dispersion spectra , the present daz selection is independent of field intensity weaker than @xmath1 mg .",
    "the inverse problem remains to be investigated : could some high - field white dwarfs also be polluted ?",
    "an answer to that question would require detailed modeling beyond linear zeeman effect , but spectral lines could still escape detection because of line spread .",
    "we present an analysis of two recently identified polluted white dwarfs from the revised nltt catalogue of @xcite : nltt  888 and the magnetic white dwarf nltt  53908 . in section 2 ,",
    "we present new high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of these objects . with these data ,",
    "we constrain the atmospheric parameters ( section 3.1 ) , the magnetic field strength in nltt  53908 ( section 3.2 ) , and we conduct an abundance analysis ( section 3.3 ) . finally we summarize our results in section 4 and examine the particular case of nltt  53908 along with the class properties of cool , magnetic daz white dwarfs .",
    "we first observed nltt  53908 with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) attached to the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla observatory on ut 21 october 2008 .",
    "we used grism number 11 ( 300 lines / mm ) with a 1 arcsecond slit - width resulting in a resolution of @xmath2  .",
    "the spectrum revealed a cool daz white dwarf with caii h&k .",
    "incidentally , @xcite classified nltt  53908 ( pm i 22276@xmath31753 ) as a da white dwarf .",
    ".equivalent widths and line velocities of nltt  888.[tbl_lines ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^ \" , ]      + references : ( 1 ) this work ; ( 2 ) @xcite ; ( 3 ) @xcite ; ( 4 ) @xcite ; ( 5 ) @xcite ; ( 6 ) @xcite ; ( 7 ) @xcite",
    "we obtained accurate calcium abundance measurements in the atmospheres of the daz white dwarfs nltt  53908 and nltt  888 . also , we measured the iron abundance in nltt  888 and found that nltt  53908 is a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "these two objects join a class of cool , polluted white dwarfs .",
    "table  [ tbl_cool ] lists all daz white dwarfs with @xmath4 k. their atmospheric parameters and abundance measurements are taken from the cited references .",
    "it is worth noting that within this sample of cool daz white dwarfs , the iron to calcium abundance ratio varies by a factor of @xmath5 from an abundance ratio close to unity ( nltt  43906 ) and up to @xmath660 ( nltt  888 ) , and assuming steady state accretion , this range of abundances suggests a remarkable diversity in the accretion source composition .    also , table  [ tbl_cool ] lists confirmed surface magnetic fields @xmath7 or upper limits based on the shape of the h@xmath8 core . requiring that the @xmath9 components occupy separate resolution elements we have @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the resolving power and @xmath12 is the magnetic line displacement .",
    "we find that @xmath13 kg , where @xmath14 is the land factor and @xmath0 is given in  .",
    "for those stars that have been observed spectropolarimetrically we provide the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath15 measurement or upper limit . out of 13 objects listed in table  [ tbl_cool ] ,",
    "four are known to possess a magnetic field . restricting the sample to temperatures below 6000",
    "k , seven objects remain with three harbouring a magnetic field .    the incidence of magnetism in the general population of white dwarfs has been reported to be as low as @xmath16% in spectropolarimetric surveys @xcite to possibly as high as 13 - 21% in the old population of nearby white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the field strengths range from a few kg ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to several 100 mg covering five orders of magnitude .",
    "assuming a flat distribution per field decade @xcite , we estimate that 40% of magnetic white dwarfs have fields below 1 mg ( corresponding to the largest field in our daz sample ) , i.e. , @xmath67% of the old , local population . assuming that our daz sample was drawn from a similar population we find that the probability of identifying 4 magnetic white dwarfs in a sample of 13 objects is below 1% .",
    "therefore , we can be confident at the 99% level that the population of cool daz white dwarfs has a higher incidence of magnetism than currently reported in the general population .",
    "for example , @xcite reported the identification of twelve magnetic white dwarfs in a survey of @xmath17 cool white dwarfs ( 4,000@xmath1810,000 k ) or an incidence of 11% .",
    "more specifically , eight out of 64 hydrogen - rich white dwarfs ( 13% ) were found to be magnetic , with only two objects with a field below 1  mg .",
    "the probability that our sample of 4 magnetic objects out of 13 daz white dwarfs could be drawn from a population with a 3% ( 2/64 ) field incidence is below 0.1% .",
    "important questions remain unanswered : first , having estimated the field incidence among cool , polluted white dwarfs , what would be the incidence among their warmer ( @xmath19  k ) counterparts ?",
    "conversely , what would be the fraction of polluted white dwarfs in a high - field ( @xmath20  mg ) sample ? in the context of merger - induced magnetic fields",
    "@xcite , only mergers occurring on the red giant or asymptotic red giant phases generate fields . also ,",
    "diffusion models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply that atmospheric pollution quickly recedes after an accretion event .",
    "a dense circumstellar environment increases the probability that these events would be observed simultaneously in a given system .",
