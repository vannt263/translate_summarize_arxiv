    "the kaon @xmath0-parameter remains an important ingredient in current analyses of cp violation in the standard model  @xcite .",
    "it is is defined in qcd with up , down and strange quarks by the matrix element of a four - quark operator between kaon states , @xmath5 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while this matrix element is well - defined , its relation to the full amplitude in the standard model relies on the hypothesis that the charm quark can be treated as a heavy particle .",
    "while the quality of this approximation is difficult to assess , it is typically assumed to be valid at the five percent level , which sets the scale for the precision to be attained by a lattice determination of @xmath6 .",
    "despite recent progress with other fermion formulations , lattice qcd with wilson type quarks remains attractive because it is computationally cheap and does not suffer from mixing between flavour and spin degrees of freedom ( unlike staggered fermions ) . on the other hand ,",
    "all axial symmetries are explicitly broken , which leads to mixing of operators with opposite chirality , and the possible occurence of unphysical fermion zero modes in the quenched approximation . in order to avoid the latter problem in typical quenched simulations , the masses of pseudoscalar mesons are typically heavier than the physical kaon mass .",
    "concerning the calculation of @xmath6 , the mixing problem is particularly annoying . decomposing the operator @xmath7 the relevant piece for @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing is the parity even component , which renormalizes as follows  @xcite : @xmath10_{\\rm r } & = &     z_{\\rm vv+aa}\\left[o_{\\rm vv+aa}+\\sum_{i=1}^4 z_i\\ o_i^{d=6 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "while the mixing problem can be solved by imposing axial continuum ward identities  @xcite , it represents a major obstacle for precision results . note that the parity - odd operator component @xmath11 does indeed renormalize multiplicatively  @xcite",
    "this can be exploited for the computation of @xmath6 as will be explained shortly .",
    "axial and vector symmetries can be distinguished according to whether or not the quark mass term is left invariant .",
    "hence , a non - standard form of the quark mass term also modifies the form of the symmetry transformations .",
    "let us consider the continuum theory for a light quark doublet @xmath12 and the @xmath13 quark including a chirally twisted mass term , @xmath14 after a chiral rotation of the doublet fields @xmath15 and with @xmath16 chosen such that @xmath17 , the lagrangian reads @xmath18 the field rotation re - defines the symmetries and maps composite fields , e.g. @xmath19 in particular , the operators are mapped to each other at `` maximal twist '' @xmath20 , where the quark mass is determined entirely by the chirally twisted mass parameter @xmath21 .",
    "hence , by using wilson quarks with a maximally twisted light quark doublet and a standard @xmath13 quark , the complicated operator mixing problem can be by - passed  @xcite .",
    "an additional benefit consists in the elimination of unphysical zero modes by the twisted mass term .",
    "this allows for numerical simulations to get close to the physical situation : light , mass degenerate @xmath22 quarks and a heavier @xmath13 quark .",
    "however , most results in lattice qcd are currently obtained in the limit where the kaon is made out of mass - degenerate @xmath23 and @xmath13 quarks . in this way",
    "a quenched artefact is avoided  @xcite , but it implies that the zero mode problem is back for the standard wilson @xmath13 quark . in order to cope with mass - degenerate quarks we also consider a different set - up , where the rles of @xmath13 and @xmath24 quarks are interchanged .",
    "the chirally twisted doublet is now @xmath25 and after the chiral rotation one finds @xmath26 again the operators are mapped to each other provided @xmath27 . for obvious reasons we will refer to the two set - ups as @xmath28 and @xmath29 scenarios , respectively .",
    "the latter has the advantage that both @xmath23 and @xmath13 quark masses can be decreased simultaneously without encountering unphysical zero modes .",
    "setting @xmath16 to @xmath28 or @xmath29 requires some parameter tuning using known results for finite renormalization constants .",
    "in addition one needs the multiplicative operator renormalization constant .",
    "the renormalization problem has been solved non - perturbatively in  @xcite , using a finite volume scheme based on the schrdinger functional and recursive finite size techniques  @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations have been performed using the o(@xmath30 ) improved wilson quark action and the wilson s plaquette action for the gauge fields .",
    "4 - 5 @xmath31-values have been chosen in the interval @xmath32 $ ] , corresponding to lattice spacings @xmath33 , if the scale is set by @xmath34 .",
    "the lattice volumes range form @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "quark masses are tuned to achieve @xmath37 or @xmath38 and pseudoscalar masses around or above @xmath39 .",
    "the analysis of excited states determined safe plateaux regions where @xmath6 could be extracted from suitable ratios of correlation functions .",
    "finite volume effects were checked at the coarsest lattice spacing ( @xmath40 ) , and found to be below the statistical errors . in the @xmath28 scenario",
    "chiral extrapolations were performed linearly to the physical kaon mass . in the @xmath29 scenario",
    "the kaon mass could be reached by _ interpolation _ except at @xmath41 where finite volume effects at the physical kaon mass would have been non - negligible .",
    "the resulting values for the @xmath6 are given in figure  1 as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "discarding the values at the coarsest lattice the data seem to scale very well .",
    "a continuum extrapolation of @xmath29 data linear in @xmath30 seems adequate .",
    "we have performed a benchmark calculation of @xmath6 where , apart from the quenched approximation , all systematic errors are under control . these include cutoff effects , finite volume effects and the contamination by excited states .",
    "a non - perturbative renormalization procedure has been employed , and the continuum limit has been taken . the preliminary result @xmath43 has the desired precision",
    ". within errors it is compatible with results obtained by other groups using different lattice regularisations ( see @xcite for a recent review and further references ) .",
    "hence , further progress will require the inclusion of dynamical quark flavours .",
    "the recent progress with simulation algorithms for wilson - type quarks  @xcite will soon allow to compute @xmath6 with a similar precision including the effect of light dynamical up and down quarks .",
