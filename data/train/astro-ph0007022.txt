    "supernova  1998bu appeared in the leo  i group sab galaxy m  96 ( ngc  3368 ) and was discovered by mirko villi ( 1998 ) on may  9.9  ut at a magnitude of about + 13 ( unfiltered ccd ) , 10  days before maximum blue light , t@xmath4=may  19.8@xmath90.5  ut ( see below ) .",

    "this implies an explosion date for sn  1998bu of 1998  april  30.2@xmath90.5  ut .",
    "an important aspect of the discovery of this supernova is that hst images already exist for its parent galaxy m  96 .",

    "shortly after the discovery of sn  1998bu we began a programme of @xmath19 imaging .",
    "most of the data were obtained using the 82  cm instituto de astrofisica de canarias telescope ( iac80 ) on tenerife , and the 1.0  m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) at la palma observatory .",
    "some additional photometry was obtained at the 2.56  m nordic optical telescope ( not ) ( la palma ) and the 3.5  m wyoming - indiana - yale - noao telescope ( wiyn ) at kitt peak .",

    "the reduction steps included bias - subtraction , flat - fielding and correction for bad pixels by interpolation .",
    "the reduction of the data from the not is described in oudmaijer _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) .",
    "data from the other telescopes were reduced at imperial college using the starlink package ccdpack to carry out the standard procedures of de - biassing , flat - fielding and bad - pixel and cosmic - ray removal .",
    "aperture photometry was then carried out .",
    "the flux from the supernova or standard stars was measured in a circular aperture .",
    "the background was estimated and subtracted using an annulus concentric with the central aperture .",
    "the annulus inner and outer radii were respectively @xmath261.5 and @xmath262.5 that of the central aperture . for a given night and telescope ,",
    "the central aperture was selected to have a diameter equal to four times the fwhm of a typical stellar image . owing to its spatial variation ,",
    "particular care had to be taken in estimating and subtracting the background from the host galaxy . to check this",
    ", we examined @xmath27 images of m  96 taken by n. tanvir with the int in 1994 .",
    "we found that variation of the aperture annulus radius from @xmath2810  to @xmath2820  , centred on the supernova position , would affect the supernova instrumental magnitudes presented here by no more than 0.01 mag .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were then obtained using the starlink photom package .",
    "photometry was performed in two steps .",
    "first , the supernova magnitudes relative to comparison field stars were measured .",
    "the comparison stars were then calibrated against landolt field stars .",
    "the comparison stars are identified as cs1 , cs2 , cs3 , cs4 and cs5 in figure  1 .",
    "at least three of these were usually available on a given frame .",
    "for the iac80 observations , colour - corrected magnitude differences between the comparison stars and sn  1998bu were obtained using the canonical equations ( 1 ) _ viz .",
    "_ : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the instrumental magnitude differences between a comparison star and the supernova , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the colour differences , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the colour coefficients , derived below using the procedures of hardie ( 1962 ) .",
    "no airmass term appears since , for any frame , the comparison stars and supernova were observed at essentially the same airmass .",
    "the comparison stars were calibrated in @xmath22 using standard landolt ( 1992 ) fields .",
    "the observations for this were carried out with the iac80 on 1999 june 13 .",
    "the colour correction coefficients were also derived from these data using iraf s photcal package .",
    "the respective values for ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) were ( 0.022@xmath90.010 , 0.014@xmath90.007 , 0.036@xmath90.015 , 0.075@xmath90.020 ) .",
    "these values agree well with those shown in the iac80 web - page ( http://www.iac.es/telescopes/iac80/instrumentacion.html#color ) .    for the wiyn observations , calibration of the comparison stars in @xmath27",
    "was carried out using landolt standards observed at the wiyn telescope on 1998 june 5 .",
    "similar procedures were used as for the iac80 calibrations . however , no landolt standards were observed in @xmath41 or @xmath8 .",
    "therefore we used a modified version of equations ( 1 ) _ viz .",
    "_ : @xmath42 values for ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) were found to be ( 0.002@xmath90.008 , -0.014@xmath90.018 , 0.073@xmath90.028 ) .",
    "the @xmath27 comparison star magnitudes obtained from the iac80 and wiyn all agreed to within the errors , and so the weighted mean values from these telescopes were adopted .",
    "the @xmath22 comparison star magnitudes are shown in table  1 .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of the jkt the observations that were obtained of standard star fields did not span an adequate colour range .",
    "moreover , the constraints of scheduled jkt observers meant that often only two or three filters were available , and in a variety of combinations . in view of this",
    ", we did not carry out colour corrections for the jkt data .",
    "colour correction procedures , such as those described above , can alter the magnitude by as much as 0.1 , with the @xmath41 and @xmath8 filters usually being the most sensitive to this effect .",
    "however , since our sn  1998bu magnitudes were obtained by averaging the values obtained relative to comparison stars of different colour indices , we expect the error due to inadequate colour correction to be small .",
    "nevertheless , for such cases , we have increased the uncertainty to @xmath90.075 .",
    "we then used the calibrated magnitudes of the comparison stars ( table  1 ) to transform the colour - corrected differences from equations ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) into apparent magnitudes for sn1998bu using equations ( 3 ) _ viz .",
    "_ : @xmath46    only a few @xmath41-band measurements were obtained . moreover ,",
    "due to the lack of observations of standard stars in this band , we had to indirectly calibrate the comparison stars . to achieve this , we used average @xmath41-band magnitudes for these stars from jha _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) and suntzeff _ et al . _",
    "given the larger uncertainties in this procedure we estimate a precision of no better than @xmath9 0.1 in the @xmath41-band apparent magnitudes of  sn1998bu .",
    "thus , at a given epoch and telescope , for each available comparison star a set of magnitudes was calculated for sn  1998bu . the weighted mean magnitude in each band",
    "was then obtained .",
    "these are listed in table  2 .    [",

    "( 1999 ) who report maxima at + 1.2@xmath90.7 , +",
    "0.6@xmath90.7 and 3.4  @xmath91.1  days for @xmath27 respectively , and with jha _",
    "( 1999 ) who find the v - maximum to have occurred at + 1.6@xmath91.3  days .",
    "this behavior has been noted in other type  ias such as sn  1990n and sn1992a ( suntzeff 1993 , leibundgut 1998 , lira _",
    "1998 ) . clearly , this is not the behavior of a simple cooling blackbody , where the maximum would occur later at longer wavelengths . that the photosphere is not a pure blackbody is confirmed by the contemporary spectra ( figure  2 ) .",
    "we note that for sn  1998bu the times between maxima in different bands do _ not _ agree with the analysis of sn  ia light curves by schlegel ( 1995 ) .",
    "he obtained @xmath50-@xmath51  d , @xmath50-@xmath52  d and @xmath53-@xmath54  d , while our results for sn  1998bu are + 3.3 , 1.4 and 4.7  d respectively .",
    "we also see a pronounced second maximum in @xmath55 at about + 25  d together with a corresponding inflection in @xmath11 . again",
    ", this behavior has been seen in other type  ias ( _ e.g. _ ford _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) .      in figure  8",
    "we show both the optical and infrared light curves .",
    "the latter were obtained by plotting our ir photometry ( table  3 ) together with data from mayya & puerari ( 1998 ) and jha _ et al . _",
    "these data constitute one of the most complete early - time infrared light curves obtained for a type  ia supernova . as mentioned above",
    ", it is the first time that ir photometry for a normal type  ia event has been acquired _ before",
    "_ t@xmath4 .",
    "we find that the _ first _ maximum in the ir light - curves occurs at about -5  d. thus , there is a trend in which the epochs of first maximum occur earlier as we move from the @xmath11-band through @xmath55 and into the ir .",
    "we also show in figure  8 the @xmath56 template light curves of elias _ et al . _",
    "( we have slightly truncated elias _ et al .",
    "_ s original templates so that the earliest epoch of the template corresponds to elias _ et al .",
    "_ s earliest observation . )",
    "the position of these templates were fixed on the time axis assuming that the fiducial time , @xmath57 , of elias _ et al .",
    "_ corresponds to  -6.25  days .",
    "the ir light curves have been shifted vertically to provide the best match to the data . a detailed discussion of the ir light curves is given in meikle ( 2000 ) .",
    "sn  1998bu exhibited an unusually high degree of reddening . at t@xmath4 , @xmath58 , much redder than the typical @xmath59 of sne  ia ( branch , 1998 ) .",
    "however , both the light curve shapes and the spectral features of sn  1998bu are typical of a type  ia event ; this and the results of our polarimetry lead us to conclude that sn  1998bu was indeed a normal type  ia supernova , but that it was heavily reddened by dust .",
    "estimation of the amount of reddening is , however , a difficult issue .",
    "several methods have been considered .",
    "one way is to use the relation between the equivalent width ( @xmath60 ) of interstellar lines such as na  i  d and the colour excess , @xmath61 ( barbon _ et al .",
    "recently , munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) produced an improved determination of the relationship for the milky way by measuring @xmath61 for 32 o - type and b - type stars .",
    "the spectra of sn  1998bu exhibit narrow na  i  d absorption lines in the rest frames of both the milky way and m  96 ( munari _ et al .",
    "the @xmath60s are , respectively , 0.19    and 0.35   .",
    "( 1998 ) also reported _ single _ na  i lines in the milky way and m  96 . with these data , and assuming that munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) relation is also valid in m  96 , we obtain a total colour excess ( _ i.e. _ including galactic reddening ) for sn  1998bu of @xmath61=0.21 , or @xmath62=0.65 assuming @xmath63=3.1 .",
    "this is a significantly lower value than that found by consideration of the sn colours ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , munari & zwitter ( 1997 ) warn that the use of the na  i  d1 line to account for interstellar extinction is only valid when the line can be modeled with a single gaussian component .",
    "when absorption is multi - component , their relation provides an _ upper limit _",
    "only for @xmath61 .",
    "thus , as also pointed out by suntzeff _",
    "( 1999 ) , this is inconsistent with the sn - colour derived values .",
    "a different procedure is that followed by phillips _",
    "they use a technique based on the fact that all type  ia events show a very similar @xmath64 evolution between 30 and 90  days after @xmath65-maximum . for sn",
    "1998bu , they find a total @xmath66 or @xmath67 ( @xmath63=3.1 ) .",
    "another sn - colour procedure is the multicolor light curve shape method , developed by riess _",
    "it is a multi - template ( @xmath22 ) method that uses a training set of well - studied sne  ia to produce a `` standard sn  ia '' , and deviations from this fiducial event are quantified as a function of changes in luminosity and extinction .",
    "application of this method by jha _",
    "( 1999 ) to sn  1998bu gives a total @xmath61=0.30 or @xmath62=0.94 , consistent with the value obtained by phillips _",
    "et al._. yet another sn - colour method has been proposed by krisciunas _",
    "_ ( 2000 ) .",
    "they compared the @xmath68 colours of sn  1998bu with those of less - reddened sne  ia and infer @xmath69 , again consistent with phillips _",
    "et al._.    one further approach is to compare sn  1998bu with sn  1981b . as pointed out in meikle & hernandez ( 2000 ) and in section  3.1.1 ( above ) , the detailed optical spectral features of these two sne  ia around @xmath70 are very similar , especially redward of 5000  (see figure  2 ) .",
    "the major difference between the two events is the overall spectral slope .",
    "we therefore assume that the supernovae are intrinsically identical and that the difference in slope is due to extinction .",
    "we modified a sn  1981b spectrum taken at t@xmath4 ( branch _ et al .",
    "_ 1983 ) by simultaneously scaling the flux by wavelength - dependent and wavelength - independent factors .",
    "the behavior of the wavelength - dependent factor is taken to be the cardelli _",
    "( 1989 ) extinction law .",
    "this procedure was followed until a good match was obtained between the sn  1981b spectrum and one of sn  1998bu at -0.8  d. this was achieved with a _ difference _ in a@xmath71 between the two sne  ia of @xmath72 , or @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , this represents a lower limit to the sn  1998bu extinction .",
    "the matched spectra are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that there are some differences between the individual spectral features but that they are generally quite small . however , as mentioned earlier , the calcium triplet absorption is significantly deeper in sn  1981b . using their @xmath64 evolution method , phillips _",

    ", we obtain for sn  1998bu @xmath75 , or @xmath0 , in good agreement with the sn - colour derived values described above .",
    "we used this value with the cardelli _",
    "( 1989 ) law , @xmath76 , and a distance modulus of @xmath15 ( see introduction ) to determine the absolute intrinsic peak magnitudes .",
    "these are shown in table  6 .",
    "we find that sn  1998bu peaked at @xmath77 ( see table  6 for other bands ) .",
    "this is @xmath78 and @xmath79 fainter than the values found by , respectively , suntzeff _ et al . _ and jha _ et al . _",

    "s ( 1999 ) relations ( 1719 ) we obtain @xmath83  km / s / mpc .",
    "_ derive @xmath84  km / s / mpc from their sn  1998bu light curves . the barely significant difference between our value and that of suntzeff _ et al .",
    "_ can be explained by the choices of extinction correction and distance modulus .",
    "we have presented first - season @xmath85 photometry and @xmath19 polarimetry of the nearby type  ia sn  1998bu . also presented",
    "are a set of optical spectra spanning  @xmath86 to @xmath87 plus a single ir spectrum at  @xmath88 .",
    "the optical light curve shapes are typical of a normal type  ia supernova .",
    "in addition , de - reddening of the -0.8  day optical spectrum using the standard galactic extinction law ( cardelli _ et al . _ 1989 ) produces a spectrum which is highly similar to those of classic sne  ia .",
    "this suggests strongly that the very red colour of sn  1998bu is due to extinction .",
    "it is also likely that the relatively strong polarization is associated with grains within m  96 along the line of sight .",
    "we conclude that both the light curve shapes and spectra indicate that sn  1998bu is a _ normal _",
    "type  ia supernova .",
    "the @xmath22 peak magnitudes we obtained are consistent with those of suntzeff _ et al . _",
