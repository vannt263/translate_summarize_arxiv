    "recently there has been considerable interest in a class of possible new states of matter featuring coexistence of superfluid and normal components .",
    "examples have appeared in several variants , under various names ( `` sarma state '' @xcite , `` interior gap '' @xcite , `` breached pair''@xcite - which we adopt here , `` gapless superconductor '' @xcite ) . breached pair states are candidates to arise when there are interactions favoring pairing between fermions with fermi surfaces of different size .",
    "they are quite different from the famous loff phases @xcite , and need not break translation invariance .",
    "the basic _ ansatz _ for this class of states goes back to old work of sarma @xcite .",
    "there are two main causes for the recent upsurge in interest .",
    "first , new candidate applications have emerged .",
    "these include notably cold atom systems , where there can be great flexibility in manipulating denisities , effective masses , and interactions @xcite ; and high - density qcd , relevant to neutron star interiors , as will be our concern below .",
    "second , and importantly , parameter regimes have been identified where the new states are likely to be stable .",
    "general heurisitic arguments , based on extrapolation from clear limiting cases ( ultrastrong coupling , flat bands ) were presented in @xcite .",
    "quantitative comparisons between breached pairing and other homogeneous states , identifying favorable cases , have been presented in @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that inhomogeneous ( phase separated superfluid and normal ) states can compete favorably with breached pair states .",
    "this is an interesting question , that receives further investigation .",
    "our preliminary conclusion is that such phase separation can occur , but only in rather special parameter regimes .",
    "we shall not discuss it further here .    in this paper we shall compare the energy of breached pair to conventional bcs and normal state alternatives , in some models suggested by high density qcd .",
    "our calculations may have application to neutron stars , but in view of the difficulty of interpreting astrophysical observations and the idealized nature of the models perhaps their main interest is methodological .",
    "we illustrate in this specific context how one establishes the ( in)stability of breached pairing , and the influence of different physical conditions .",
    "here we summarize properties of the breached pairing superconductor concetrating on the stability condition of the breached pairing phase .",
    "we present calculations in a toy model @xcite that has a superfluid ground state of up - strange quark pairs .",
    "the relation of more realistic cases to this model is worked out in the appendix .",
    "we consider massive @xmath0 and massless @xmath1 quarks both being relativistic , @xmath2 where the fermi momenta are related to the chemical potentials as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the fermi momentum for the @xmath0-quark is smaller than that for the @xmath1-quark , @xmath5 .",
