    "quantum phenomenon has been observed by numerous experiments on microscopic scales . however , on macroscopic scales , it is difficult to find quantum effects , such as quantum superpositions .",
    "a lot of physicists have been looking up the root of quantum - to - classical transition for decades .",
    "the reason can be divided into two categories : coarsened measurement and decoherence@xcite .",
    "commonly viewpoint is that decoherence plays a prominent role in quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "there are two routes to explain decoherence : one route is that system interacts with external environments , the other is taken in wave function collapse@xcite , which need not external environments .",

    "we find that gravitational time dilation can reduce or increase the decoherence due to spontaneous emission in different reference frames ( different zero potential energy point ) .",
    "it is attributed to the fact that in different reference frame , the distinguishability of emission photon from different positions is different .",
