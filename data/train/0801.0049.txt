    "if we write @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the condition for @xmath9 to be horizontal becomes @xmath10 a _ horizontal isotopy _ is an isotopy via horizontal loops .",
    "the _ rotation number _ @xmath11 of a horizontal loop @xmath9 is the number of complete turns of the velocity vector @xmath12 , as we once traverse the loop in positive direction , relative to the trivialisation of @xmath1 given by @xmath13 .",
    "the rotation number is clearly invariant under horizontal isotopies , and it is easy to show by examples ( see section  [ section : proof ] ) that every integer can be realised as the rotation number of a horizontal loop .",
    "the following theorem was proved by j. adachi in  @xcite :    two horizontal loops are horizontally isotopic if and only if their rotation numbers agree .",
    "adachi proves this theorem by studying the image of @xmath9 under the projection @xmath14 .",

    "this is more in line with the usual conventions as regards the contact geometric aspects of our discussion . )",
    "he determines the ` reidemeister moves ' in this projection and then reduces the proof to the corresponding classification of topologically trivial legendrian knots in standard contact @xmath17-space , due to ya .",

    "the purpose of the present note is to show that a much shorter proof can be given by using the projection @xmath18 instead .",

    "this means that @xmath23 defines a legendrian immersion into @xmath24 with its standard contact structure @xmath25    the _ rotation number _ @xmath26  in the contact geometric sense  of such a legendrian immersion is defined as the number of complete turns made by @xmath27 as the loop @xmath28 is traversed once in positive direction , relative to the trivialisation of @xmath29 given by the vector fields @xmath30 so it is obvious that @xmath31 .",
    "the rotation number @xmath26 is invariant under legendrian regular homotopies , i.e.  @xmath32-homotopies via legendrian immersions .",
    "moreover , one can prove by elementary methods that the map @xmath33\\mapsto { { \\tt rot}}({\\overline{\\gamma}})$ ] defines a one - to - one correspondence between legendrian regular homotopy classes of legendrian immersions @xmath34 on the one hand , and the integers on the other ; see ( * ? ? ? * thm .",

    "we call a planar curve of this type a _ front_.    the coordinate @xmath37 can be recovered as the slope of the front projection : @xmath38 the coordinate @xmath39 can be recovered as an ` area integral ' : @xmath40 this equation defines the horizontal lift of a legendrian immersion @xmath28 even when its front projection @xmath41 is singular , e.g.   during the first legendrian reidemeister move  ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , the area condition discussed in the preceding section being satisfied , this lifts to a horizontal loop @xmath42 with @xmath52 . for other non - zero rotation numbers ,",

    "now consider two horizontal loops @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding legendrian immersions @xmath55 satisfy @xmath56 , so there is a legendrian regular homotopy between them . as the proof in @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
