    "in two - dimensional field theories and statistical systems the conformal invariance provides a powerful tool which allows us to compute exactly physical quantities such as correlation functions , critical exponents and field contents @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the conformal symmetry is infinite - dimensional in two dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we can classify conformal field theory ( cft ) models and find their field contents by studying the finite - size effects and the modular transformation properties of such theories on the torus . above two dimensions",
    "the conformal symmetry is finite - dimensional , hence this symmetry appears less useful in analyzing critical systems . despite this difficulty , extension of some of the notions of the two - dimensional cft to higher - dimensional theories",
    "has been pursued by a few authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , cardy has studied modular transformation properties of the partition function of conformal invariant free field theories on a compact space of three and higher dimensions @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "he has shown that the partition function of such theories on @xmath8 of radii @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively and a moduli @xmath9 , or its derivative with respect to @xmath10 , is invariant under @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to examine whether interacting field theories have the same modular transformation properties at their fixed points where they are conformally invariant .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the @xmath0 nonlinear @xmath1 ( nl@xmath1 ) model on a three - dimensional compact space as an example of models including interactions .",
    "of a variety of three - dimensional compact spaces , @xmath12 allows us to study the properties with respect to conformal invariance of the field theory defined on it @xcite . in @xmath13 with @xmath7 less than four @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model is known to be renormalizable in the @xmath14 expansion and permits us a nonperturbative analysis .",
    "furthermore , the model possesses order ( symmetry breaking)-disorder phase transition in dimensions @xmath15 @xcite and hence it serves our purpose of studying the modular properties at the critical value of the coupling constant . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "the @xmath16-dimensional @xmath17 nl@xmath1 model has been studied as an effective field theory of the long wavelength behavior of 2-dimensional quantum antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "recently , from the analyses of the large @xmath5 @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model on the semi - compact space @xmath18 , interesting results have been obtained on the low temperature properties of the quantum antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "curiously the specific heat of @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model is represented by roger s polylogarithmic functions @xcite ; this is analogous to the specific heat of certain two - dimensional integrable systems being represented by roger s dilogarithmic function @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model in the @xmath7-dimensional euclidean space @xmath20 is defined by the action @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an @xmath5-component vector obeying the constraint @xmath23 . by introducing an auxiliary field @xmath24 ,",
    "the partition function is expressed as @xmath25}\\bigr ) \\label{action3}\\ ] ] by carrying out the path integration of @xmath22 , the partition function ( [ action3 ] ) is written in terms of the effective action as follows .",
    "@xmath26 where we have set @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the limit @xmath28 keeping @xmath29 fixed . in this limit",
    "we can evaluate the partition function ( [ efpart ] ) by means of the saddle point method .",
    "the gap equation for the saddle point value of @xmath24 is @xmath30 it is known that the @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model on @xmath31 has an infrared ( ir ) fixed point at @xmath32 and an ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point at @xmath33 for @xmath15 .",
    "we will consider the model on @xmath34 ( of radii @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ) and solve the gap equation ( [ saddle ] ) at the uv fixed point at @xmath33 , at which the model is transformed by a conformal mapping into a theory which possesses conformal invariance in @xmath35 .",
    "we recapitulate the renormalization group ( rg ) transformation of the @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model @xcite . in accordance with the saddle point approximation",
    ", we calculate the @xmath36-function of the @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model in the large @xmath5 limit to obtain the fixed point .",
    "since the uv divergence behavior is independent of the global property of the space @xcite , we may consider the model on @xmath18 ( of radius @xmath3 ) instead of @xmath37 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the weak constant magnetic field @xmath38 for the purpose of computing the wave function renormalization constant .",
    "we choose the the first component of @xmath22 in the direction of @xmath39 and set @xmath40 .",
    "the partition function is now given , after performing the path integral for @xmath41 , by @xmath42    in parallel with field theories at finite temperature , uv divergences of the present model can be handled by introducing two bare coupling constantsb @xcite , @xmath43 the rg transformation in the theory defined by ( [ ps2 ] ) amounts to changing the momentum cut - off in @xmath44 from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 plays the role of the lattice spacing in the lattice version .",
    "the @xmath36-functions for @xmath29 and @xmath48 can be calculated by carrying out this rg transformation in the momentum space .",
    "the result is : @xmath49 where we have put @xmath50 .",
    "we find that the rg transformation has two fixed points , @xmath51 where we have set @xmath52 by considering the limit @xmath53 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath54 is ir stable and @xmath55 is uv stable .",
    "we note that the critical coupling constants @xmath56 are the same as those on @xmath57 as they should be .",
    "the @xmath36-functions ( [ beta1 ] ) and ( [ beta2 ] ) can also be obtained in the saddle point method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58 vanishes only at @xmath59 .",
    "this reflects the fact that no phase transition can occur at finite @xmath3 in the spacetime @xmath60 ; it is a special case of the mermin - wagner - coleman s theorem @xcite .",
    "the above result was derived by adopting the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) in the @xmath61 coordinate .",
    "the @xmath36-functions for the model with the antiperiodic boundary condition ( apbc ) can be derived by repeating the same rg transformation as above .",
    "the result differs from eqs .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) and ( [ beta2 ] ) slightly : @xmath62 the uv stable critical value of @xmath29 is @xmath63 and coincides with that in the case of pbc , as it should .",
    "we are now ready to investigate the @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model on @xmath37 .",
    "we consider this model with the value of @xmath29 fixed at its uv critical value @xmath64 while the value of @xmath48 being left arbitrary .",
    "first we write the gap equation ( [ saddle ] ) explicitly .",
    "the eigenvalues of the laplacian @xmath65 on @xmath37 are @xmath66 , where @xmath67 with @xmath68 being 0 or 1 depending on whether we take the pbc or apbc in the direction of @xmath61 respectively .",
    "@xmath69 takes non - negative integers , and @xmath70 integers .",
    "write @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "the gap equation ( [ saddle ] ) takes the form @xmath73 we solve this equation ( [ sadmode ] ) by keeping @xmath29 fixed at its critical value @xmath64 and find the critical value @xmath74 of @xmath75 or @xmath76 of @xmath24 .",
    "we solve the gap equation ( [ sadmode ] ) in the three limiting cases @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "( 1a)@xmath80  ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the gap equation ( [ sadmode ] ) is further reduced to @xmath82 on substituting the critical value @xmath83 for @xmath29 on the left side of ( [ e0a ] ) , we get @xmath84 , and hence @xmath85 regarding the length of @xmath61 as the inverse of the temperature , we have the @xmath0 nl@xmath1-model at finite temperature .",
    "then @xmath86 is the correlation length at temperature @xmath87 .",
    "the specific heat of this model , @xmath88 , has been calculated in @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are roger s dilogarithmic and trilogarithmic functions respectively , @xmath92 .",
    "it is curious to see that a rational number emerges from polylogarithms .",
    "it has been observed that roger s dilogarithmic functions appear in the computation of the specific heat of two - dimensional integrable models and that a simple rational number comes out by use of the addition formula @xcite .",
    "( 1b)@xmath93  ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the saddle point equation ( [ sadmode ] ) can be reduced to @xmath95 we obtain to the order of @xmath96 @xmath97 the anomalous dimension @xmath98 of @xmath22 can be read from the @xmath4 dependence of the correlation length , @xmath99 , which follows from finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "we get @xmath100 , which agrees with the usual computation in the large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "( 1c)general case .",
    "we consider the case , @xmath79 . in eq.([sadmode ] ) , the summation over @xmath69 is divergent , and is regularized by introducing the cutoff @xmath101 .",
    "the summation can be performed by means of the euler - maclaurin formula @xmath102 } + o({1 \\over n^4 } ) .",

    "@xmath105      in the gap equation ( [ sadmode ] ) , the eigenvalues of the @xmath106 part of @xmath65 take the squares of half odd integers times @xmath107 .",
    "those of the @xmath61 part of @xmath65 also take the square of half odd integers if we impose the apbc in the direction of @xmath108 .",
    "we solve the gap equation ( [ sadmode ] ) in three cases depending on @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath109 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , there arise a few subtle problems in the study of quantum effects in scalar field theories with apbc .",
    "first , one can not make use of the nave effective potential in the computation of the expectation value @xmath1 of @xmath41 , since a constant expectation value obviously contradicts apbc .",
    "one can circumvent this difficulty by considering instead linear modes .",
    "the saddle point equation for @xmath1 , then takes the same form as that in the pbc case , @xmath110 .",
    "second , the tachyonic modes will generally arise after taking account of the quantum effect of twisted scalar field on untwisted scalar field .",
    "we will see that the same type of tachyonic modes appear in the solution of the gap equation in the apbc case .",
    "( 2a)@xmath80  ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the gap equation can be further reduced to @xmath111 at @xmath112 , this equation has a solution @xmath113 , with @xmath114 this solution is tachyonic , @xmath115 , and it should be interpreted that the correct value is @xmath116 .",
    "we have not fully understood the mechanism of dealing with these tachyonic modes . while we consider the unstable saddle point where we solve the gap equation of this model .",
    "( 2b)@xmath93  ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the boundary condition becomes immaterial in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "hence we have the same result as ( 1b ) .",
    "( 2c)general case .",
    "we consider the limit of @xmath118 with @xmath119 fixed . in the case of @xmath120 ,",
    "the gap equation can be evaluated by means of the euler - maclaurin formula ( [ euler ] ) .",
    "we have to the order of @xmath121 as @xmath122 by setting @xmath123 , we obtain @xmath124 .    in the case of @xmath125 ,",
    "we can also make use of ( [ euler ] ) and find the critical value as @xmath126 formally . by the same argument as made in the case ( 2a ) , the definition should lead @xmath116 under the condition of at least @xmath127 .",
    "( this upper - limit can been seen if we consider a small @xmath10 , which make @xmath74 equal to just 0 not to a pure imaginary number . )",
    "with the above result , let us discuss the physical aspects of the @xmath0 nl@xmath1 models on ( semi)compact manifolds .",
    "first we discuss the modular invariance of this model .",
    "the simplest example model with the modular invariance is the two dimensional free scalar model on a torus with moduli @xmath10 .",
    "its free energy @xmath128 is invariant under @xmath11 , if we ignore the regularization of the divergence .",
    "we can calculate the free energy of @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model on @xmath12 with the apbc by means of the saddle point method .",
    "if we choose @xmath33 , the arguments in [ s : apbc ] enable us to calculate free energy as @xmath129 to the order @xmath121 in the case of @xmath120 and in the region @xmath127 in the case of @xmath125 .",
    "obviously it is not invariant under @xmath11 .",
    "hence we deform the definition of the free energy ( [ free ] ) as follows according to @xcite .",
    "@xmath130 where @xmath131 is a some function .",
    "if we exchange the two radii of @xmath106 and @xmath61 , _ i.e. _ @xmath132 , the deformed free energy defined above is invariant . because the every derivative of the free energy ( [ free ] ) by @xmath10 leads the factor @xmath133 , the deformed free energy ( [ dfree ] ) can be regarded as the half derivative by @xmath10 of the free energy ( [ free ] ) .",
    "second we discuss the attempt of the expansion of zamolodchikov s c - theorem in dimensions higher than three .",
    "there exist an very important considerations about the c - theorem @xcite in higher - dimensional field theory .",
    "the c - functions defined by the finite size correction and that introduced by the energy momentum tensor do not coincide in higher dimensions in general . we expect it is useful to analyze the partition functions to understand the c - theorem .",
    "we can calculate the specific heat @xmath134 of the large @xmath5 @xmath0 nl@xmath1 model ( pbc ) with arbitrary @xmath135 by means of the saddle point method .",
    "if we obtain the mass gap @xmath136 from the gap equation ( [ saddle ] ) for the coupling constant @xmath135 , the graph of the specific heat calculated as @xmath137 is presented as      we see from the above graph that the specific heat has the local minimum at @xmath140 @xmath141 , @xmath142 @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , although we consider the model on @xmath12 or @xmath60 , which does not allow the phase transition , this behavior of the specific heat seems to justify to consider the model on @xmath12 or @xmath60 with the coupling constant @xmath143 , which is the critical value on @xmath144 .",
    "we expect some interpretation in terms of the rg . in apbc case",
    ", we do not find such a local minimum of the specific heat .",
    "therefore we can not give a simple justification to @xmath143 on @xmath12 or @xmath60 .",
    "we have a variety of the expansion .",
    "especially , we expect the analysis of the four - fermion model or supersymmetric nl@xmath1 model are important because they permit the nonperturbative analysis .",
    "furthermore it is reported that the latter has zero @xmath36-function independent of the coupling constant @xcite . and",
    "the combination of the campactification and @xmath145-expansion will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
