    "the first results on polarized deep - inelastic scattering from the emc experiment @xcite were interpreted @xcite as evidence that the total spin of the proton carried by quarks was rather small , in fact compatible with zero .",
    "this suggested that the polarization of sea quarks , including non - valence strange quarks , might be larger than naively expected from the quark model .",
    "an alternative explanation had also been suggested @xcite , based on the contribution from gluon polarization to the matrix element of the flavor - singlet axial current .",
    "there are strong arguments @xcite that the glue polarization is unlikely to be as large as needed to explain the emc data , but the ultimate resolution must come from experiment .",
    "the more recent , next generation smc @xmath9 deuterium @xcite and slac @xmath10 @xmath11he @xcite experiments have been recently analyzed @xcite and found to be compatible with each other and with the original emc data .",
    "the possibility of a large gluon polarization therefore continues to be of interest .",
    "the lack of the analog of polarized charged - current scattering implies that far less flavor separation is possible when examining spin - dependent parton distributions .",
    "the integral constraint on the polarized parton distributions arising from the spin-1/2 nature of the proton includes possible contributions from constituent parton orbital angular momentum and so is far less restrictive than the corresponding momentum sum rule .",
    "all of these observations have pointed to the desirability of more direct measurements of the polarized gluon distribution in polarized hadron collisions akin to the information available on the unpolarized gluon distribution from , say , direct photon production .    at the same time , the prospects @xcite for the availability of high luminosity polarized proton - proton collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at collider energies ( @xmath12 ) have been extensively discussed .",
    "these facts have motivated an increasingly large literature discussing the spin - dependence and sensitivity to polarized parton distributions of many standard model processes .",
    "familiar processes such as jet production @xcite , direct photons @xcite , and weak boson production @xcite have all been studied as have processes such as quarkonium production at both low @xmath5 @xcite@xcite and high @xmath5 @xcite and double photon production @xcite .",
    "many of the results of these studies have found their way into the proposals @xcite for spin - physics experiments using the proposed rhic detectors .",
    "using such facilities , a comprehensive program involving the extraction of the polarized parton densities and tests of the spin - structure of the standard model is envisaged .    the availability of high quality data on @xmath0-quark production from both ua1 @xcite and cdf @xcite combined with the availability of a full set of next - to - leading ( nlo ) order qcd calculations of heavy quark cross - sections @xcite have proved to be a valuable new constraint on unpolarized gluon distributions @xcite .",

    ". we do not attempt in this study any systematic analysis of the detectability of heavy quark production in the proposed rhic detectors nor make any quantitative estimates of the sensitivity of such experiments to the extraction of the polarized gluon distributions .",

    "each of the individual ` average asymmetries ' @xmath58 \\hat{a}^{ij}_{ll } d\\hat{\\sigma}_{ij } } { \\sigma_{tot}}\\ ] ] is both a measure of the spin - dependence ( via the @xmath39 ) of a specific contributing initial parton configuration and of its importance in the cross - section .",
    "this quantity is a useful figure of merit for the examination of the spin - dependence in any specific reaction .",
    "the observable asymmetries , @xmath59 , which require information about the ( presently unknown ) @xmath60 , will of course be smaller than this quantity , barring accidental cancellations , since @xmath61 . given a set of putative polarized distributions , the observable @xmath59 can be easily calculated and estimates of the measurability of any particular asymmetry can be made by using the total cross - section and luminosity ( and appropriate cuts for the realistic detection of the events ) to estimate the total event rates . in this report , we will focus on calculations of @xmath62 as it provides a reasonable glimpse into the relative importance of the various contributions to the observable spin - dependence .    for @xmath0-quark production in @xmath13 collisions in the range of energies accessible to rhic ( @xmath63 )",
    ", we find that when calculating the _ _ total cross - section the average partonic center of mass energy , @xmath64 , is in the range @xmath65 .",
    "this fact and the results shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 2 then imply that the observable @xmath59 , when typical polarized gluon distributions ( such as those of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are included , does indeed yield a not unreasonably small and _ _ positive asymmetry , just as found by contogouris _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "the total cross - section is , of course , dominated by events at low transverse momentum , i.e. for values of @xmath66 and for large values of @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 . from figs .",
    "1(a ) and 2 we can see that as the center - of - mass energy is increased and as @xmath69 , i.e. , when the transverse momentum is increased , the partonic level spin - spin asymmetries rapidly approach @xmath49 for the dominant gluon fusion process , changing dramatically the expected magnitude and even sign of the observable asymmetry .",
    "motivated by the excellent ua1 @xcite and cdf @xcite data on @xmath0-quark production as a function of transverse momentum , we calculate the average @xmath62 mentioned above for b - quark production in @xmath13 collisions at the highest rhic energy , @xmath70 , for the integrated production cross - section , namely @xmath71 versus @xmath72 .",
    "we use the @xmath1 subprocesses above , a ( relatively ) recent set of leading - order ( lo ) unpolarized parton distributions @xcite ( as that is all that is required in eqn .",
    "13 ) corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , we assume @xmath74 and use a momentum scale @xmath75 as suggested by ref .",
    "these assumptions reasonably reproduce the ua1 integrated cross - section ( when rapidity cuts are included ) in proton - antiproton collisions , provided one uses an overall multiplicative @xmath76-factor of roughly @xmath77 , a fact which is consistent with many other analyses @xcite .    the resulting average asymmetry in the integrated cross - section in proton - proton collisions is shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) as a function of @xmath72 . as expected , the value at @xmath78 , corresponding to the total cross - section , gives a small positive average asymmetry consistent with our observations above .",
    "for values of @xmath79 , the spin asymmetry in the dominant gluon fusion contribution is already approaching its asymptotic value of @xmath49 so that the ` analyzing power ' of this reaction , based on the @xmath1 processes , seems optimally large .",
    "this reaction is unique in that all contributing lowest order processes are characterized by the same maximal partonic level asymmetry , at least at large @xmath5 .    for comparison , we plot in fig .",
    "3(b ) the corresponding average @xmath62 for the @xmath1 processes contributing to direct photon production , namely @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this case",
    "also , increasing @xmath5 leads to @xmath82 where @xmath39 is reduced compared to the larger values in the forward and backward direction found at lower @xmath5 .",
    "this helps to explain the ( slow ) decrease in @xmath83 from to the @xmath84 contributions .",
    "the partial cancellation between the @xmath85 and @xmath86 contributions is also evident .",
    "to estimate the effects of including polarized gluon distributions , we evaluate the observable asymmetry , @xmath59 , using a simplified set of assumptions .",
    "we assume that the quark sea is unpolarized so that there is no contribution from the @xmath87 diagrams .",
    "for the polarized gluon distribution , we use the ansatz , @xmath88 which yields a value of the integrated contribution to the proton spin ( at @xmath89 ) of @xmath90 where @xmath91 this range of values spans many of the models which have been discussed in the literature .",
    "the resulting asymmetries are shown in fig .  4 and demonstrate the large variation in @xmath59 which is possible .",
    "this analysis based on the @xmath1 subprocesses suggests that not only could @xmath0-quark production at large @xmath5 be an excellent process for the extraction of the polarized gluon distributions ( based on the large value of the average asymmetry ) but that the dramatic change in the sign of @xmath59 implied by fig .",
    "3(a ) would constitute an interesting test of the spin - structure of the qcd matrix elements .",
    "all of this interesting spin structure is in a region where perturbative qcd is applicable and at energies where it has been thoroughly tested .",
    "in addition , the energy is not so high as to require the use of resummation techniques @xcite which are necessary when working at very low @xmath92 .",
    "the large @xmath76 factor necessary to reproduce the data , however , is reminder that radiative corrections play an important role in the detailed structure of the observable cross - section and we examine the possible effects of such next - to - leading order effects in the next section .",
    "the ability to confront or even to extract unpolarized gluon distributions from @xmath0-quark production data relies on the existence of a full set of next - to - leading order corrections to heavy quark production @xcite which are by now standard .",
    "clearly any attempt to probe the _ _ polarized gluon distributions will also eventually require a complete analysis of the _ _ spin - dependent @xmath8 corrections as well . in this section",
    "we make a few comments on the likely effect that such corrections might play in modifying the results found in sec .",
    "ii . we do not attempt a complete analysis of the spin - dependent radiative corrections .",
    "the finite @xmath8 corrections remaining after the extraction of divergent pieces to be associated with parton evolution will come in two varieties : those involving vertex and box - diagram corrections to the @xmath1 processes and those arising from @xmath7 subprocesses such as @xmath93 .",
    "the first class of corrections , retaining as it does the same basic helicity structure of the final state heavy quarks , will still yield a partonic level spin - spin asymmetry approaching @xmath6 at large transverse momentum , i.e. , @xmath94 , when @xmath95 becomes large compared to the final state quark masses .",
    "the approach to this value could well be different but at large enough values of @xmath5 , say @xmath96 , we expect the same general features as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) to appear .",
    "we can not , for example , argue on general grounds that the value of @xmath39 near threshold will remain maximally large at @xmath43 .",
    "long before the complete nlo calculations were available , it was argued @xcite that gluon fragmentation to heavy quark pairs , via @xmath7 subprocesses such as @xmath97 is likely to be a large , even the dominant source of heavy quarks at large transverse momentum , i.e. , for @xmath98 , yielding much , if not all , of the needed @xmath76 factor .",
    "the standard argument put forth is that at @xmath99 in the parton - parton center - of - mass frame , gluon fusion is much more likely to produce a gluon pair rather than quarks , i.e. , @xmath100 the graphical structure of the @xmath7 diagrams ( dominated by @xmath101- and @xmath102-channel gluon exchange ) is very different from that of the @xmath1 diagrams ( coming from @xmath103-channel annihilation and heavy quark exchange ) leading to different kinematics , and presumably , a different spin structure .",
    "in fact , the spin - spin asymmetries for the underlying @xmath1 processes shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , namely @xmath45 and @xmath104 , are all large and _ positive _ which leads to the disappointing possibility that there might be substantial cancellations with the spin - effects present in the @xmath105 processes . using the asymmetries in fig .",
    "1(b ) ( in the large @xmath5 limit we use the values at @xmath106 of roughly @xmath107 ) and the observed necessary @xmath76 factor of @xmath108 , we might estimate very crudely that the average asymmetry could be reduced to something of the order @xmath109 instead of @xmath110 .    to examine this possibility more quantitatively ,",
    "we choose to model the effects of the @xmath7 subprocesses by following one rather typical pre - radiative correction analysis of such effects by glover , hagiwara , and martin @xcite .",
    "they ` regularize ' the @xmath7 contributions by requiring that @xmath111 where the notation @xmath112 collectively denotes the subprocesses @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 . in eqn .",
    "18 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are cutoffs which we take to be @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",
    "these conditions ensure that the final light parton , ( c ) , is hard and acollinear to the initial parton directions while the angular cut excludes collinear gluon emission from the final heavy quarks .",
    "the remaining phase space configurations are further restricted to three regions , described by the following cuts :    ` a ' : three - jet configuration    @xmath120    ` b ' : heavy quark excitation    @xmath121    ` c ' : collinear @xmath122 production    @xmath123    in the equations above , @xmath124 is the separation in the pseudorapidity - azimuthal angle plane , namely , @xmath125^{1/2 } \\;\\;\\;.\\ ] ] the cut - off dependence of these prescriptions has been extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is also found that the massless limit of the exact @xmath7 matrix elements @xcite is an excellent approximation at all but the very smallest values of @xmath72 . making use of this simplified model of the important contributions arising from @xmath101- and @xmath102-channel gluon exchange processes , we plot in fig .",
    "5 the resulting integrated cross - sections using both the @xmath18 and these regularized @xmath126 subprocesses , here collected by initial parton combination ( @xmath127 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . )",
    "as expected , the latter diagrams dominate the cross - section at large transverse momentum , in this case even roughly reproducing the required @xmath108 factor ( which is somewhat fortuitous ) .",
    "these results are consistent with earlier calculations which make similar assumptions @xcite but they do seem to overestimate somewhat the contribution from the @xmath85 initial states compared to the exact nlo calculation @xcite .    because the massless matrix elements are known to be a good approximation in this case , we can also make use of the corresponding partonic level asymmetries for the massless @xmath7 subprocesses which were first evaluated in ref .",
    "we use these to evaluate the resulting average asymmetry , @xmath128 , now incorporating all the @xmath1 and @xmath7 subprocesses . the resulting average asymmetry in the integrated cross - section",
    "is shown in fig . 6 as a function of @xmath72 . in each of the three kinematic regions ,",
    "the @xmath86 contributions are negligible and in the @xmath129 configuration the individual contributions to the average asymmetry from the @xmath127 and @xmath85 configurations are consistent with existing results @xcite on the spin asymmetries in three - jet events , namely small and positive for the @xmath85 configurations and small and negative for the @xmath127 type . in both the @xmath130 and @xmath131 classes ,",
    "the spin - spin asymmetries arising from the @xmath127 and @xmath85 contributions are relatively large and positive , reflecting their connection to the underlying @xmath132 and @xmath133 origin as seen in fig .",
    "the intuitive and qualitative estimates quoted above seem to be borne out in this approximate calculation showing that there may well be a large cancellation in the spin - dependence .",
    "we also note that the @xmath7 configurations make a small negative contribution to the asymmetry in the integrated cross - section at very small values of @xmath72 , somewhat reducing the asymmetry in the total cross - section .",
    "this is , however , in the region where the massless approximation for the matrix - elements and partonic asymmetries is worst and , in fact , may likely give the wrong sign for @xmath39 .",
    "( compare the purely massless @xmath134 matrix elements and asymmetries to the exact ones which would give a constant asymmetry of @xmath49 at threshold instead of @xmath43 . )",
    "combined with the fact that the nlo corrections to the @xmath1 diagrams will likely give similar positive asymmetries near threshold , it seems that the asymmetry in the total cross - section , or at least for @xmath135 , could have a form quite similar to that obtained with the lo @xmath1 diagrams alone . once again",
    ", however , a complete nlo spin - dependent calculation will be required to verify these conjectures .",
    "one possible experimental difficulty with attempts at extracting spin information from such low @xmath5 data is that the ua1 and cdf data both have lower bounds on @xmath72 of roughly @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xmath138 respectively .",
    "the total @xmath0-production cross - section that ua1 quotes is then extracted from extrapolations of the @xmath5-dependent data to @xmath139 and to the full - rapidity interval by using the qcd predictions for the rapidity variation .",
    "it is in just this region that one would like real data to probe the spin - dependence .",
    "we note that a very similar analysis could be applied to gluino pair production using the @xmath1 cross - sections and asymmetries of ref .",
    "@xcite , provided one could generalize the results for @xmath140 of ref .",
    "@xcite to include spin - dependence . in this case , however , the use of any massless approximation for the matrix elements would likely be unjustified due to the presumably large gluino mass . any realistic appraisal of the spin - dependence of gluino production at supercollider energies will seemingly require a much more detailed analysis than has been done to date .",
    "finally , it has been pointed out @xcite that the _ _ transverse spin - dependent quark and antiquark distributions ( often called ` transversity ' ) can be probed using the @xmath141 contribution to heavy quark production .",
    "while this annihilation process does indeed have a large intrinsic transverse polarization asymmetry , @xmath142 , the overall contribution of this subprocess to the total cross - section is never large in @xmath13 collisions at the energies we discuss , so that the corresponding average asymmetry @xmath143 , is never more than @xmath144 .",
    "while these results do not constitute a complete analysis of the spin - dependence of @xmath0 quark production , they are suggestive of some general trends which we believe will be a robust feature of the full calculation .",
    "inclusion of the polarized parton distributions for a realistic evaluation of the observable asymmetries , @xmath59 , will no doubt change the cancellations found above to some extent but we certainly expect that the sizable cancellation found above between lo and nlo effects will persist in any complete analysis .",
    "this might well imply that @xmath0-quark production may not be the most sensitive process from which to attempt to constrain or extract information on the polarized gluon distribution , despite the highly suggestive lo results .",
    "this cancellation is in itself , however , a very interesting prediction which depends sensitively on the spin structure of nlo qcd and could possibly provide a useful test of the matrix element structure of the strong interactions beyond the leading order .",
    "if the polarized gluon density were measured in other reactions and found large , then the smallness of the observable @xmath59 in @xmath0-quark production might then be attributable to this cancellation and not to the inherent smallness of @xmath145 .",
    "next - to - leading corrections to jet or direct photon production , for example , for which the @xmath8 diagrams contain the same kinematical structure would not be expected to yield such a dramatic change in spin - dependence from the leading order result .",
    "this is already apparent from the nlo corrections for direct photon production which have recently appeared @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion is also suggested by the fact that jet ( direct photon ) production is dominated at leading order by spin - one gluon ( spin-1/2 quark ) exchange and this feature is retained by nlo calculations and is confirmed by data on jet - jet and jet-@xmath146 angular distributions @xcite .",
    "the very different kinematical structures found in the @xmath1 processes ( @xmath101- and @xmath102-channel @xmath147 exchange and @xmath103-channel production ) and in the @xmath7 processes ( @xmath101- and @xmath102-channel gluon exchange ) could presumably be probed by similar @xmath0-quark pair angular distributions but this is experimentally difficult . the spin - dependence of this process might well provide a unique glimpse into the interplay between lo and nlo corrections in qcd .",
    "the only similar case evident so far in the study of standard qcd processes at polarized colliders is the case of double photon production which gets dominant contributions from both @xmath148 via born diagrams and from @xmath149 via box - diagrams and exhibits something of the same partial cancellation of spin - dependence @xcite .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , these results reinforce the notion that the reliable extraction of spin - dependent parton distributions from data obtained in polarized proton - proton collisions may necessarily be much more dependent on the availability of radiative corrections than has been the case for unpolarized distributions in the past .",
