    "the cluster ages experiment ( case ) is a long - term project whose main goal is to determine the distances and ages of nearby globular clusters ( thompson et al .",
    "the primary distance indicators used by the case group are detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "the search for these relatively rare objects is performed using 1-meter class telescopes .",
    "usually for each target cluster , several hundred ccd frames are collected over one or more observing seasons .",
    "suitable candidates are then observed with larger telescopes ( eg .",
    "thompson et al . 2001 ) . a secondary benefit of the project s survey phase is the detection of large samples of variables of various types including rr  lyr and sx  phe stars .    the first globular cluster for which the case project determined a distance was @xmath0 centauri",
    "an analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data for an eclipsing binary ogle  gc17 yielded an apparent distance modulus equal to @xmath7 mag ( kaluzny et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "time series photometry of @xmath0 cen obtained by the case project in the 1999 and 2000 seasons resulted in light curves of almost 400 variables from the cluster field ( kaluzny et al .",

    "we use these data to calibrate different formulae which permit the calculation of absolute magnitudes of rr  lyr variables .",
    "it has been known for many years that the absolute magnitude of rr lyr stars @xmath1 is a function of metallicity [ fe / h ] ( sandage 1981a , b ) .",

    "the estimates of the zero point of the relation vary from around 1.1 mag ( gould & popowski 1998 ) to 0.8 mag ( gratton et al .",
    "1997 , caloi et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that some theoretical models predict that a simple linear relationship of form ( 1 ) may not exist at all .",
    "this is caused by the fact that even variables of the same metallicity have different luminosities depending on the direction of their evolution across the instability strip ( lee 1991 ) .",
    "more complex relations between @xmath1 of rr lyr stars and their metallicities were documented , for example , by caputo ( 1997 ) .",
    "there is also observational evidence for a non - linear dependence of @xmath1 on [ fe / h ] .",
    "for example , caputo et al .",

    "the systematic errors caused by using the simple linear relation ( 1 ) may be minimized by excluding highly evolved rr lyraes from the analyzed samples . in particular , the formula should be used with caution when analyzing variables belonging to globular clusters showing `` blue '' horizontal branches .",
    "recent investigation of the @xmath9}$ ] relation in @xmath0 cen was done by rey et al .",
    "they used [ fe / h ] metallicities derived from the @xmath18 index of the ca@xmath19 photometric system .",

    "( 1997 ) .    the new @xmath2-band light curves of rr lyr variables in @xmath0 cen obtained by the case ( kaluzny et al .",
    "2003 ) have about three times as many observed points as the photometry of kaluzny et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "this permits a more precise estimation of mean @xmath20 magnitudes and allows the elimination of objects with unstable light curves from the calibration sample . adopting an apparent distance modulus of the cluster as determined by ( kaluzny et al .",
    "2002 ) we can obtain a new @xmath21}$ ] relation for rr lyr stars in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the sample used for the calibration includes 122 stars with stable light curves of good quality and metallicities determined by rey et al .",
    "we decided to remove the rrab variable v52 from the further analysis .",
    "its high luminosity suggests that it is a foreground star .",
    "additionally , van leeuwen et al . ( 2000 ) gives only a 45% membership probability for this variable , based on a proper motion study .",
    "the @xmath9}$ ] dependence for remaining 121 variables is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 . the middle panel shows the same relation but for a sub - sample consisting of 67 rr@xmath22 variables .",

    "we estimate that the external error of the zero point of the photometry is about 0.02 mag .",
    "transformation from @xmath20 to @xmath1 is performed using the distance modulus whose error is 0.04 mag .",
    "thus , combining this value with 0.02 mag error resulting from computing the mean magnitudes @xmath20 , we assumed that individual absolute magnitudes of rr lyr stars from our sample have uncertainties of 0.05 mag .    knowing the errors we were able to fit straight lines to the graphs shown in fig .",

    "they have significantly brighter magnitudes and longer periods than those near the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) .",
    "rey et al . ( 2000 ) investigated this problem in @xmath0 cen .",

    "recently , chaboyer ( 1999 ) in his review of globular cluster distance determinations adopted @xmath28 arguing that 1-@xmath29 range of this value encompasses the majority of recent determinations for @xmath11 .",
    "our results do not differ significantly from those presented by rey et al .",

    "al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "the mean difference in @xmath2 magnitude between both data sets consisted of 53 rr@xmath22 stars is @xmath30 mag .",
    "having established the relation ( 4 ) , we can use it for determining the distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud - @xmath31 .",
    "we used the data of walker ( 1992 ) , who summarized the ccd photometry of 182 rr lyr variables belonging to seven lmc globular clusters .",
    "we decided to exclude from our analysis variables from the cluster ngc 1841 because it is most probably located about 0.3 mag closer than the main body of the lmc .",
    "the mean value of the reddening free magnitude @xmath32 of 160 rr lyr stars from the remaining six clusters is @xmath33 mag .",
    "the mean metallicity of this sample is @xmath16}=-1.9\\pm0.2 $ ] .",
    "knowing the observed magnitude of rr lyr stars from the lmc and computing their absolute magnitude using relation ( 4 ) we determined that the distance modulus to the lmc is equal to @xmath34 mag .",
    "this result supports the `` long '' distance scale .",
    "most recently , clementini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) presented new photometry and spectroscopy for more than a hundred rr lyrae stars in two fields located close to the bar of the lmc .",
    "the dereddened apparent average luminosity of the variables from their sample was @xmath35 mag at the mean metal abundance of @xmath16 } = -1.48\\pm0.03 $ ] .",
    "their metallicity was tied to the harris ( 1996 ) scale which differs by about 0.06 dex from the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale used by rey et al .",
    "thus the mean metallicity of their sample is @xmath16 } = -1.54\\pm0.03 $ ] on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) scale .",
    "application of equation ( 4 ) for their data gives the distance modulus to the lmc equal to @xmath36 mag .",

    "( 2003 ) we find that our @xmath1-@xmath16}$ ] relation gives @xmath37 mag .",
    "on the one hand , nonlinear pulsation models of rr lyr stars suggested that the luminosity of these stars may be uniquely related to the pulsation period and the shape of their light curves ( e.g. simon & clement 1993 ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that there is a close correlation between the fourier coefficients of the light curves and their corresponding periods and luminosities .",
    "such correlations could potentially improve the distances derived for these stars .    on the other hand serious attempts to find such empirical relations pioneered by kovcs & jurcsik ( 1996 , hereafter kj96 ) and most recently updated by kovcs & walker ( 2001 ) - hereafter kw01 - bore mixed success .",
    "the empirical procedure is essentially reduced to adopting a linear combination of the period and @xmath38 selected fourier parameters @xmath39 for predicting the rr lyr absolute magnitude : @xmath40 the coefficients @xmath41 and cluster distance moduli @xmath42 are fitted to minimize scatter @xmath43 in the apparent average magnitudes @xmath44 summed over @xmath45 rr lyr stars in @xmath46 clusters : @xmath47 ^ 2\\label{e:1a}\\ ] ] problems are indicated by an apparent lack of convergence from the whole procedure to a unique solution .",
    "different data sets yield substantially different relations , both in respect to the optimum parameter set and in the numerical values of the involved coefficients . for rrab stars",
    "kj96 obtained : @xmath48 while kw01 using 383 rr@xmath22 stars from 20 globular clusters recommend either of three : @xmath49    note that the sine phase convention is used here unless otherwise stated .",
    "a worrying inconsistency is shown , for example , by the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ e:2 ] ) and ( [ e:3 ] ) .",
    "several different causes might be responsible for these problems :    1 .   the original problem connected to the sensitivity of high order fourier coefficients to poor data melted away with abundance of the high quality observations ( e.g. kaluzny et al .",
    "1997 , kw01 and the present work ) .",
    "the more persistent problem is connected to the apparent inability of the procedure to account for the hidden diversity of properties related to metallicity , evolutionary status and possibly misidentified pulsation mode , all capable of producing several different trends in the data .",
    "this problem is acknowledged by rejecting outlying stars from the rest by the @xmath52 distance criterion ( see e.g. kovcs & kanbur 1998 ) .",
    "the risk is that the omitted stars hide much information on the nature of the physics involved .",
    "3 .   one reason for widely different values of the coefficients obtained from the different data sets could be the strong correlation between the fourier coefficients .",
    "such fits could be sensitive to a group of coefficients while changing loads between individual members of the group matters little .",
    "finally , some evidence discussed further in this paper indicates that magnitudes of rrab stars might also depend on a factor , so far unaccounted for , independent of the period and shape of the light curve .",
    "we recommend future trials with colors sensitive to temperature and/or metallicity .    in order to clarify the situation and possibly to identify the cause of these problems we undertook the same kind of analysis from scratch and for an entirely new set of data .",
    "our present sample consists of 76 rr@xmath22 variables observed in @xmath0 cen by kaluzny at el .",
    "( 1997 ) and kaluzny et al .",
    "the photometry in these two papers is of very good quality and shows no systematic differences in the zero point ( see kaluzny et al .",
    "2003 for details ) .",
    "following recommendations of kovcs & kanbur ( 1998 ) for analysis we used only @xmath53 stars with @xmath54 .",
    "a clear advantage of our data is very consistent photometry obtained within the same project and using the same telescope .",
    "the vast majority of stars was observed at least 500 times , hence we obtained very precise and reliable values of the fourier coefficients .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the question whether the shape of the rrc light curve is or is not correlated to the luminosity in principle does not exclude their use as standard candles .",
    "more problems in this respect stem from the large intrinsic scatter of their magnitudes , of order 0.1 mag . for lmc ebru et al .",
    "( 2001 ) list ogle observations of 450 rr@xmath55 stars from the fields sc2 , sc3 , sc4 and sc5 . as these observations were only a byproduct of a project designed for other purposes , the number of @xmath2 filter observations , their exposure length and distribution are not optimal for measuring such fine effects as the third harmonic in the small amplitude , near sinusoidal light curves of rrc . for this practical reason we could not test simon & clement ( 1993 ) formula ( eq . [ e:11 ] ) as none of the ogle light curves yielded @xmath56 with the required accuracy of 0.2 radians .",
    "application of our formula ( eq . [ e:12 ] ) for these data was straightforward , as finding the amplitude of the ogle @xmath2 light curves posed no difficulty at all . from the total sample of 450 rr@xmath55 stars we selected only 57 variables with sufficient amplitude @xmath57 mag and errors not exceeding 0.010 mag .",
    "7 we plot @xmath1 computed from eq .",
    "( [ e:12 ] ) against the observed average magnitude . in this respect",
    "we were reassured , in a perverse way , that the lmc rrc stars behave quite similarly to our stars from @xmath0 cen : they both reveal little correlation of the predicted @xmath1 with its actual value .",
    "such a situation calls for a repeated analysis of the type performed by kw01 for as large a sample of rr@xmath55 stars from different globular clusters as possible , in order to check whether the formulae based on fourier coefficients have any prediction value for @xmath1 .",
    "the impression of similar properties is further confirmed in the @xmath58 diagram ( fig .",
    "8) plotted for rr@xmath55 stars from both @xmath0 cen ( full circles ) and the lmc ( open circles ) .",
    "both samples occupy the same locations without showing any systematic differences . in our opinion",
    ", this particular similarity justifies use of the rrc stars as standard candles in these clusters .",
    "the @xmath2-band photometry of stars in @xmath0 cen obtained by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2003 ) contains 3 times as many observations and with higher precision than available so far . to understand what could be learned from such data we attempted here to redo from scratch analysis of the rr lyr stars in this cluster .",
    "the results combined with the new metallicity determinations of rey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and distance modulus to the cluster derived by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , yield for rr lyr stars a new @xmath9}$ ] relation independent of previous ones . for evolved stars , with @xmath59 days",
    "the relation becomes nonlinear .",
    "rejecting them , we obtain a nearly linear relation with inclination consistent with previous results . applying this relation to available observations of rr lyr in the large magellanic cloud",
    "we obtain its distance modulus @xmath37 mag consistent with the `` long '' distance scale .    using the same @xmath2-band photometry we derive and calibrate the formulae connecting the absolute magnitude of rr lyr stars of bailey type @xmath22 with the fourier parameters describing their light curves .",
    "this approach , closely following previous works , proved only partially successful in that the residuals from fit remain large compared to the statistical errors of observations and in that the new formulae show little relation to the ones derived from older data . employing our best fit formula calibrated with our distance modulus of @xmath0 cen to the ogle photometry of 13 rr lyr stars from the lmc enabled us to obtain its distance modulus equal to @xmath60 mag .",
    "the agreement with the value obtained from the @xmath9}$ ] relation is very good , which on one hand is hardly surprising as both data sets overlap , yet on the other hand demonstrates the formal validity of our methods .",
    "summarizing , we estimate the lmc distance modulus equal to @xmath61 mag where the systematic error is determined by the error in the distance modulus of @xmath0 cen ( kaluzny et al .",
    "the distance to the lmc is thus equal to @xmath62 kpc .",
    "our results for the rr@xmath55 stars are less encouraging . despite nearly sinusoidal light curves , our photometry proved to be accurate enough for analyzing the harmonics , however any fitted formulae employing fourier coefficients yielded @xmath1 only loosely correlated with @xmath20 . on the theoretical side",
    "this indicates dependence of @xmath20 on some additional factor yet to be identified . on the practical side",
    "any estimated @xmath1 suffer from large random errors .",
    "a comparison with the rrc stars from the lmc observed by the ogle team ( ebru et al . 2001 ) proved difficult , because apart from the intrinsic errors of our formulae , the poorer sampling of data , obtained for other purposes , prevented an accurate evaluation of the harmonics .",
    "an excellent review of the recent distance determinations to the lmc was given by walker ( 1999 ) .",
    "here we point out only the discrepancy between so - called `` short '' and `` long '' distance scales .",
    "the former , based on the statistical parallax and the red clump methods , gives the distance modulus to the lmc as approximately 18.2 - 18.3 mag ( gould & popowski 1998 , udalski 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "this is 0.2 - 0.3 mag smaller than the value of about 18.50 mag resulting from the cepheid period - luminosity relation and theoretical models of the horizontal branch or globular clusters main sequence fitting .",
    "however , recent improvements of the red clump method based on the infrared photometry seem to indicate that this method also provides the distance modulus of the lmc at around 18.50 mag . for example",
    ", three papers based on the @xmath46-band photometry were recently published giving the distance modulus to the lmc as equal to @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 mag , respectively ( alves et .",
    "al 2002 , sarajedini et al .",
    "2002 , pietrzyski & gieren 2002 ) .",
    "also , the newest determination of the cepheid period - luminosity relation , based on @xmath66600 stars , indicates that the distance to the lmc is around 18.50 mag ( sebo et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "our estimate is in excellent agreement with these recent results proving that our calibration of the absolute magnitudes of rr lyr stars produces valuable results .",
    "we would like to thank igor soszyski from the ogle project for his valuable suggestions concerning the ogle catalogue of variable stars in the lmc and grzegorz stachowski for reading the manuscript .",
