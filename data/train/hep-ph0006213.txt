    "in studying the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite due to the coherent forward scattering of neutrinos by electrons in matter , it is often instructive to consider first special cases where the electron density is taken to be a simple function of distance",
    ". it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate perhaps the simplest case : the case where the electron density is a linear function of distance .",
    "the problem of the linear electron density is formulated in sec .  2 .",
    "the case of two neutrino species has a long history @xcite , and the solution , as reviewed in sec .",
    "3 , can be expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions  see , for example , chapter  viii of @xcite , or equivalently confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "however , the solution in this form is specific to the case of two neutrino species , and is not convenient for generalizations to more neutrino species .",
    "physically , this generalization is essential because there are at least three types of neutrinos .",
    "therefore , sec .  4",
    "is devoted to treating in a different way the msw differential equations for linear electron density and two neutrino species . on the one hand",
    ", this alternative method must lead to the same solutions as those in sec .  3",
    "; on the other hand , this new treatment can be readily generalized to any number of neutrino species .",
    "this case of linear electron density but any number of neutrino species forms the main content of the present paper , and various aspects of this case are treated in sec .  5 and sec .",
    "let there be @xmath0 types of neutrinos , denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the neutrino of the first generation , i.e. , the one that forms the su(2 ) doublet with the electron .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath1 is the only neutrino which interacts differently with the electron because of the exchange of the intermediate boson @xmath5 , while the others neutrinos @xmath2 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 @xmath4 all have the same interaction with the electron .",
    "thus , the neutrino mass matrix @xmath7 @xcite is an @xmath8 matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath7 give the @xmath0 neutrino masses @xmath9 .",
    "in analyzing the msw effect , the neutrino masses are usually taken to be much smaller than the momentum @xmath10 of the neutrino . under this assumption , because @xmath11 it is @xmath12 that enters in the differential equation for the msw effect .",
    "let @xmath13 be the @xmath0-component neutrino wave function , then this differential equation is @xmath14\\psi(x)\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is an @xmath8 matrix whose only non - zero element is @xmath16_{11}=\\sqrt{2}\\,{g_{\\rm f}}n_e(x),\\ ] ] with @xmath17 the fermi weak - interaction constant and @xmath18 the electron density at the point @xmath19 .",
    "the terminology `` linear electron density '' is used to mean that @xmath18 is a linear function of @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath18 is the density of electrons , it can not be negative .",
    "therefore , the msw differential equation ( [ eq : msw - d.e . ] ) is physically meaningful only for the half - line of @xmath19 where @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the neutrino or the electron , but not both , is replaced by its antiparticle , the quantity @xmath21_{11}$ ] of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w11 ] ) changes sign .",
    "therefore , the complementary half - line of @xmath19 describes this slightly different physical situation . for this reason , eq .",
    "( [ eq : msw - d.e . ] ) is to be studied for the entire range of @xmath19 , from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .    for the present case of the linear electron density , eq .",
    "( [ eq : msw - d.e . ] ) can be reduced , for a given value of @xmath10 , to the dimensionless standard form @xmath24 where @xmath25 \\psi_2(t ) \\\\[2pt ] \\psi_3(t ) \\\\[2pt ] \\vdots \\\\[2pt ]   \\psi_n(t ) \\end{bmatrix}\\ ] ] and @xmath26 a_2    & b_2 & 0    & \\hdots & 0 \\\\[1pt ] a_3    & 0    & b_3 & \\hdots & 0 \\\\[1pt ] \\vdots & \\vdots    & \\vdots &   & \\vdots \\\\[1pt ] a_n & 0    & 0    & \\hdots & b_n \\end{bmatrix}.\\ ] ] this is accomplished as follows .",
    "\\(i ) to change the independent variable from @xmath19 to @xmath27 , there is a shift in origin and a rescaling with possibly a reversal of sign .",
    "\\(ii ) to change the dependent variable from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , there is a rotation in the second to @xmath0th component and an introduction of exponential factors with possibly some minus signs .    furthermore , from ( i ) and ( ii )",
    ", the elements of the matrix @xmath30 can be chosen to satisfy the conditions @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33    consider the following special cases .",
    "\\(a ) if , for some @xmath34 , say @xmath35 , @xmath36 , then it is seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) and ( [ eq : a ] ) that @xmath37 is decoupled from the other @xmath38 s . thus ,",
    "this special case of @xmath0 types of neutrinos is reduced to a problem with @xmath39 types of neutrinos .",
    "\\(b ) if , again for some @xmath34 , say @xmath35 , @xmath40 , then a rotation can be carried out between @xmath37 and @xmath41 such that , after this additional rotation , the new @xmath42 is zero .",
    "thus , this special case of @xmath40 can be reduced to the above case of @xmath36 , and hence again this second special case of @xmath0 types of neutrinos is reduced to a problem with @xmath39 types of neutrinos .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to study the ordinary differential equation ( [ eq : psi - schr ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) and ( [ eq : a ] ) under the condition ( [ eq : sum - b - zero ] ) together with @xmath43 and @xmath44 in view of the inequality ( [ eq : b - ordered ] ) , it turns out to be convenient to define symbolically @xmath45",
    "let us review first the well - known case of the msw effect for two types of neutrinos @xcite . by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : msw - d.e.])([eq : sum - b - zero ] ) , the msw equations are @xmath47 or more explicitly @xmath48 with @xmath49 . a second - order ordinary differential equation for @xmath50 is obtained by applying @xmath51 to eq .",

    "( [ eq : msw-2-nu - second - o ] ) is @xmath60.\\ ] ] this is one convenient form for the solution for @xmath46 .",
    "in the existing treatment in the literature for linear electron density and two types of neutrinos @xcite as reviewed in sec .  3 , the crucial step is to recognize that the second - order differential equation ( [ eq : msw-2-nu - other ] ) can be solved exactly in terms of known higher transcendental functions , either parabolic cylinder functions or confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "more generally , for @xmath0 types of neutrinos , the corresponding differential equation is of @xmath0th order . even for @xmath61 ,",
    "the third - order differential equation is not one for any well - known transcendental function .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to generalize the treatment of @xmath46 to larger values of @xmath0 , we must recast the solution of sec .",
    "3 so that parabolic cylinder functions and confluent hypergeometric functions do not play an essential role .    a useful question to ask is the following : in what way is the linear electron density especially simple ? the answer must be sought in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) , from which it is seen that the independent variable @xmath27 appears only in one matrix element , and furthermore , it appears only linearly in that element .",
    "this implies that , if fourier transform is applied to the differential equation ( [ eq : psi - schr ] ) , the differentiation with respect to the fourier - transform variable appears only once .",
    "hence it is expected that an explicit expression can be obtained for the fourier transform of @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath62 then it follows from eq .",

    "this differential equation simplifies immediately to @xmath66 or @xmath67 integration over @xmath68 gives @xmath69    from the inequality ( [ eq : a - positive ] ) , it is seen that the function on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : capf ] ) has a singularity at @xmath70 therefore the constant in ( [ eq : capf ] ) can take on different values for @xmath68 positive and for @xmath68 negative .",
    "in other words , the differential equation ( [ eq : capf - d.e . ] ) is really two differential equations , one for @xmath71 and the other for @xmath72 , consistent with the fact that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : capf - d.e . ] ) has a singularity at @xmath73 . with this observation ,",
    "it is natural to define    @xmath74    and @xmath75 inverting the fourier transform ( [ eq : capf - fourier ] ) , this choice leads to @xmath76 with the notation ( [ eq : b - extras ] ) , these two formulas ( [ eq : psi1 - 1 - 2 ] ) can be written as @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "it remains to show that both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are confluent hypergeometric functions of the correct parameters and argument .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to define @xmath81 so that it follows from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : w11 ] ) .    the consideration here will be limited to the part of the asymptotic behavior that does not vanish as @xmath111 .",

    "smirnov @xcite and others @xcite on the sun taking into account two species of neutrinos , it has been found that most of the effect takes place in a fairly narrow region around a particular value of the electron density . because of this , it is quite accurate to use a linear approximation to the electron density .    for more than two species of neutrinos ,",

    "it is believed that , in so far as this case of linear electron density is applicable to the physically interesting case of solar neutrinos , the asymptotic evaluation of sec .",
