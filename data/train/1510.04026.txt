    "the past few years have seen a dramatic growth in cellular network traffic , contributed by billions of mobile devices as the first - class citizens of the internet . the global cellular network traffic from mobile devices",
    "is expected to surpass 24 exabytes ( @xmath0 ) per month by 2019 @xcite , 9@xmath1 larger than the traffic served by existing cellular network .",
    "while we are embracing a world with ambient cellular connectivity , however , we are facing a critical and challenging problem  we have limited understanding about the patterns of traffic experienced by cellular towers deployed in urban areas , especially when 3 g and lte networks are widely available in current modern metropolis@xcite .",
    "we do not completely understand how urban functional regions and ecologies , such as business district , affect the mobile traffic of cellular towers@xcite .",
    "in addition , the dominant factors that affect their traffic variations are still unknown .",
    "such limited knowledge significantly increases the cost of operating thousands of cellular towers in big cities . despite of the aforementioned lack of knowledge , understanding the traffic patterns of cellular towers in the large scale urban environment",
    "is extremely valuable for internet service providers ( isp ) , mobile users , and government managers of modern cites@xcite .",
    "if we can _ identify and model _ the patterns of cellular towers , instead of using the same strategy to provide services , such as using the same load balancing and data pricing algorithms on each tower , an isp can exploit the modeled traffic patterns and customize the strategies for individual cellular towers .",
    "for example , an isp can potentially have different pricing on individual cellular tower based on the traffic it experiences .",
    "in addition , mobile users will benefit from the traffic modeling as well because they can choose towers with predicted lower traffic and enjoy better services .",
    "surprisingly , management departments of government will benefit from the traffic modeling as well because they may infer the land usage and human economy activities by looking at the patterns of cellular traffic@xcite .    on the other hand , understanding the traffic patterns of cellular towers is challenging for three reasons .",
    "first , the traffic experienced by thousands of cellular towers deployed in large scale modern cities is complicated and hard to analyze .",
    "for example , our dataset includes 9,600 cellular towers and 150,000 subscribers , where lots of redundant and conflict logs are observed . to identify traffic patterns embedded in the thousands of towers , we need to design a system that is able to clean and handle the data of large scale cellular traffic .",
    "second , we do not have the priori about the existence of patterns that can be used for representing the behavior of thousands of cellular towers . to make matters worse , even if such patterns exist ,",
    "we do not know their profiles . without these profiles , it is challenging to group thousands of cellular towers into a small number of patterns .",
    "third , the traffic of a cellular tower is affected by many factors , such as time and locations , etc .",
    "these factors , sometimes , compound with each other and further complicate our analysis .",
    "for example , significant traffic variation is observed at both fine - grained ( hours ) and coarse - grained ( days ) time scale , and across towers deployed in different locations@xcite . by addressing these challenges , in this paper",
    ", we investigate how to extract and model the mobile traffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers in a large scale urban environment via credible dataset collected by one of the largest commercial mobile operators .",
    "our core contribution is a powerful model which combines three dimensional information , including time , locations of towers , and traffic frequency spectrum , for extracting and modeling the traffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers .",
    "a breakdown of the core contribution comprises three parts .",
    "first , we design a system which leverages machine learning to identify and extract five patterns from the traffic of thousands of cellular towers .",
    "our system is built with processing large scale data in mind and is able to process the traffic of towers with granularity of 10 minutes .",
    "second , we identify the context of traffic experienced by cellular towers by investigating the correlation between time - domain traffic characteristics and locations of towers . therefore , by looking at the traffic pattern of a tower , we can infer the type of location where it is deployed and the type of users it serves .",
    "third , our frequency - domain traffic spectrum analysis reveals that any traffic of the 9,600 cellular towers can be constructed using a linear combination of four primary components corresponding to human activity behaviors .",
    "this observation provides an unique angle ( frequency ) for analyzing cellular traffic and significantly simplifies the process of analysis by a linear model .    through investigating the traffic of 9,600 cellular towers ,",
    "we find following interesting observations .",
    "first , the 9,600 cellular towers can be classified into five groups using features extracted from time - domain traffic .",
    "this experimental result confirms our motivation that a small number of patterns do exist among thousands of cellular towers .",
    "second , each of the traffic pattern maps to one type of locations , including resident , office , transport , entertainment , and comprehensive area .",
    "therefore , the traffic pattern of a cellular tower does suggest the urban ecology and location context where it is deployed as well as the type of users it serves .",
    "third , our frequency - domain analysis reveals that the transition between the five traffic patterns encodes the mobility of human .",
    "for example , when the phase of residential pattern moves toward the phase of transport pattern , people start their commute from home to work . in summary , we believe that the proposed traffic patterns extraction and modeling , combined with the empirical study on large scale cellular towers , pave the way toward a deep understanding of the traffic patterns of large scale cellular towers .    this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 , we provide details about the utilized dataset , and present some basic observations of traffic spatio - temporal distributions . in section 3 ,",
    "we design our traffic processing system and identify the key traffic patterns of the large scale cellular towers .",
    "based on the discovered five traffic patterns , in section 4 and 5 , we conduct a deep analysis and reveal the correlation among data traffic , urban ecology and human behaviors in the time and frequency domain respectively . after discussing related work in section 6 , we summarize our discoveries and discuss potential investigations in section 7 .",
    "in this section , we provide details about the dataset we investigate as well as the needed preprocessing . in addition , we visualize the spatial - temporal distribution of cellular traffic .",
    "the dataset is an anonymized cellular trace collected by an isp from shanghai , a big city in china , between aug 1st and aug 31st 2014 .",
    "each entry of the trace contains detailed mobile data usage of users , including the i d of devices ( anonymized ) , start - end time of data connection , base station i d , address of base station , and the amount of 3 g or lte data used in each connection .",
    "the trace logs 1.96 billion tuples of the described information , .",
    "the trace contains petabytes ( @xmath2 ) logs , terabytes ( @xmath3 ) per day and gigabytes ( @xmath4 ) per base station on average .",
    "this large scale and fine - grained dataset guarantees the credibility of our traffic pattern analysis and modeling .      the trace collected by the isp needs to be preprocessed because of .",
    "the preprocessing includes three steps .",
    "first , we eliminate the redundant and conflict logs , such as the identical traffic logs , introduced by technical issues .",
    "second , to solve the problem of incomplete information , we convert the addresses of base stations to their longitudes and latitudes through apis provided by baidu map , the most popular online map service provider in china .",
    "this conversion gives us the precise location of a base station , which is important for analyzing the ground truth of urban functional regions .",
    "the last step of preprocessing is computing the traffic density ( byte / km@xmath5 ) across the city .",
    "the obtained traffic density allows us to understand the spatial distribution of cellular traffic .      before diving into a deep analysis of mobile data traffic",
    ", we first visualize the spatial - temporal traffic distribution of the 9,600 base stations , where we find two interesting observations .",
    "first , the data embeds fundamental temporal patterns of mobile data traffic .",
    "figure  [ td ] shows the aggregated traffic of the 9,600 towers at different time scales .",
    "figure  [ td](a ) shows the traffic distribution of a day ( aug 7th , thursday ) where we observe that the aggregated network traffic is tightly coupled with the sleep pattern of humans .",
    "high cellular traffic is observed during the day and low traffic is experienced during midnight .",
    "there are two traffic peaks in each day : one around 12 pm and the other around 10 pm .",
    "similar patterns are observed in figure  [ td](b ) .",
    "the timing of the two peaks suggests that most people tend to consume data traffic heavily after lunch and before sleep .",
    "figure  [ td](b ) shows the traffic distribution of a week ( from aug to aug ) and figure  [ td](c ) shows the traffic distribution of a month ( from aug 3 to aug 31 ) .",
    "both figures show that the traffic exhibits a periodical pattern on the scale of a week , where weekend s traffic is less than weekday s traffic .",
    "such traffic variation comes from people s weekly work schedule .    on the other hand",
    ", our trace also records the spatial distribution of mobile data traffic .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the spatial and temporal characteristics of traffic are correlated . figure  [ sddt ] shows the traffic density at 4 am , 10 am , 4 pm and 10 pm .",
    "we find the following observations .",
    "first , towers deployed at the center of the city experience high traffic despite of the time of a day .",
    "second , at 4 am , most areas of the city are covered by dark color , which suggests that traffic demand is small because of human sleep .",
    "in contrast , at 10 am , most areas of the city are covered by light color , suggesting that traffic demand becomes high because people start working .",
    "therefore , the areas of peak traffic map to areas occupied by human , such as residential housing or central business district ( cbd ) .",
    "now , we investigate the data traffic of the of 3g / lte cellular towers and design a system that is able to identify key traffic patterns of large scale cellular towers .",
    "we start from understanding the traffic patterns of a few cellular towers to motivate our study .",
    "our cellular network traffic measurement and analysis are motivated by a key observation  the traffic pattern of one cellular tower is vastly different from another .",
    "we can clearly observe the difference of traffic between these two types of cellular towers , where the traffic profiles of residential towers have two peaks within a day and remain high across night , while the traffic profiles of towers in business district experience only one peak within a day and get close to zero across night .",
    "this comparison clearly reveals the difference of traffic patterns between the two specific types of cellular towers .",
    "however , from the perspective of an isp , which manages of cellular towers , is the traffic pattern of one cellular tower vastly different from another ? to understand this problem , we conduct a large scale measurement and investigate the recorded 9600 cellular towers in our dataset of shanghai .",
    "[ t ]        figure  [ fig : latvstime_all ] shows the traffic variations within one day with 40 randomly selected cellular towers for each degree latitudes or longitudes respectively .",
    "the x - axis shows the time in hours and y - axis shows the logical positions of the selected cellular towers in terms of latitude ( a ) or longitude ( b ) . and the color presents the normalized value where red color indicates higher traffic and blue color stands for lower traffic in these measurements , we find two observations .",
    "first , the peak hour of one cellular tower , which is marked as red , is vastly different from another during the day time when serving mobile users .",
    "in fact , the variance of the peak among the selected towers is about 10 hours .",
    "second , while most of towers experience low traffic in early morning , the first several towers , also have low traffic during evening .",
    "therefore , significant differences of data traffic are observed across cellular towers .",
    "such differences cause troubles for an isp to manage its cellular network .",
    "for example , because of the unique pattern of individual traffic , an isp can not obtain the optimal performance by using the same load balancing strategy , which is built on top of traffic patterns , on different towers .",
    "therefore , a natural question to ask is that is it possible to model the traffic pattern of of cellular towers ? more specifically , can we utilize a few simple patterns to present the traffic of of cellular towers ?",
    "identifying these patterns of cellular towers would give an isp significant benefits on network management , including load balancing , pricing , etc .",
    "our investigation suggests that at least two , maybe more , traffic patterns exist among of cellular towers .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2patterns ] shows the traffic of 40 selected cellular towers deployed in residential area and in business district . in addition , we find other two observations in this investigation .",
    "first , in terms of the traffic of residential area , all residential towers experience similar traffic patterns where the peak traffic is present around 9 pm .",
    "in addition , only a small amount of traffic is observed between 8 am and 4 pm because most users leave home for work .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn for towers deployed in business district .",
    "second , the traffic pattern of residential towers is different from towers deployed in business district where peak hour appears around 1 pm .",
    "inspired by these two observations , we conclude that traffic patterns do exist among of cellular towers . one key question addressed by this paper is finding out how many traffic patterns exist among of cellular towers and how to identify them .      investigating traffic patterns among of cellular towers is extremely challenging for three reasons .",
    "first , we have little prior knowledge about the data traffic , and do not know which cell towers may share the same traffic pattern and how the pattern may look like .",
    "second , the measured cellular traffic data is huge in terms of tracing 9,600 cellular towers for a month . to make matters worse ,",
    "the measured data is not clean in terms of unstructured logs .",
    "last but not least , the measured cellular traffic data is noisy where large variation of traffic is observed because the absolute traffic depends on the number of mobile users served .",
    "all these factors make the analysis of cellular traffic patterns extremely challenging . to tackle these challenges , we design , implement , and evaluate a system which is able to identify the key traffic patterns of such large scale cellular towers .",
    "our system is composed by three key elements : traffic vectorizer , pattern identifier and metric tuner .",
    "* traffic vectorizer : * the key of designing the traffic vectorizer is a parallel transformer , which takes the time - domain traffic logs of of cellular towers as its input and converts each cell tower s logs into a time - domain traffic vector .",
    "the vector is constructed in two phases  and normalization .",
    "* pattern identifier : * pattern identifier takes the vectorized data from the vectorizer and runs an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for identifying the key patterns of cellular tower traffic .",
    "the pattern identifier addresses one key challenge of the mining process  unknown patterns , by exploiting hierarchical clustering@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of hierarchical clustering is iteratively merging the nearest two clusters .",
    "it first considers each input point as a cluster and then bottom - up iteratively merges the nearest two clusters until the stop condition is met .    * metric tuner : * as the number of traffic patterns is unknown , a key question is when the identifier should stop its clustering . in our system",
    ", we use davies - bouldin index @xcite to explicitly inform the identifier that the optimum number of patterns have been identified .",
    "davies - bouldin index is utilized because it measures both the separation of clusters and cohesion within clusters , which mathematically guarantees good clustering result .",
    "the mathematic formulation of davies - bouldin index is as follows , @xmath6 where the objective function is the davies - bouldin index , @xmath7 is the vectorized data of cellular tower @xmath8",
    ", @xmath9 is the centroid of each cluster , @xmath10 is the number of clusters and @xmath11 is the numbers of towers within the @xmath12 cluster .",
    "we minimize the davies - bouldin index by considering two factors  the distance between clusters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are the average distance from points to their cluster s centroid .",
    "when the minimum davies - bouldin index is obtained , the optimum number of patterns is identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : pattern ] shows the five time - domain patterns identified by our system from the 9,600 cellular towers((c ) to ( g ) ) and each cluster s cdf of points distance to its centroid(b ) .",
    "the five clusters differ in terms of the time where peak traffic appears as well as the amount of traffic experienced during weekday and weekends .",
    "figure  [ fig : pattern](b ) shows that the distance cdf curves of clusters are similar and all of them increase rapidly as distance increases .",
    "80% of points distance to their clusters centroid are less than 10 , which implicates the clustering result is good .",
    "the percentage of each cluster s cell towers is shown in table  [ tab : clustercount ] , which indicates the third cluster has most cell towers and second cluster the least .",
    "since the five clusters are given by the hierarchical classifier , an interesting question to ask is what are the locations where these five types of towers are deployed ?",
    ".percentage of cell towers classified in each cluster . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * peak - valley features:*observing figure  [ fig : pattern ] , all traffic patterns experience periodic peaks and valleys . however , the traffic patterns are significantly different in peak value , valley value and peak - valley ratio .",
    "we quantify these characteristics and summarize them in table  [ tab : maxmin ] . according to table  [ tab : maxmin ] , in transport area and office area weekend s",
    "maximum traffic and minimum traffic is much less than weekday , which is consistent with last paragraph s finding .",
    "what s more , the transport s peak - valley ratio is much higher than other regions , which is explicitly presented in figure  [ fig : timecharacter](b ) .",
    "however , transport area s maximum traffic is less than other regions both in weekday and weekend .",
    "it suggests that transport area has the least traffic amount and the largest peak - valley traffic difference , while resident area and comprehensive area are the opposite .    * time of traffic peak and valley : * different urban functional regions traffic patterns differ not only in peak volume , but also in peak time .",
    "we quantify this characteristic and present it in table  [ tab : timepeak ] .",
    "we leave the blank unfilled , if there is not a periodic peak or valley . observing table  [ tab : timepeak ] , we find that traffic valley always takes place in 4:00@xmath155:00 . in weekday , transport area has two peaks in 8:00 and 18:00 , which are probably caused by rush hour . in entertainment area ,",
    "weekday s traffic peak time is 18:00 while weekend s traffic peak time is 12:30 .",
    "it suggests that people go for entertainment later in weekday because of work .",
    "[ t ]          we compare the interrelationships between normalized modeled traffic patterns in figure  [ fig : interrelationship ] .",
    "the first row of figure  [ fig : interrelationship ] compares the modeled traffic patterns of residential areas and transport hot spots .",
    "the peak of residential area is about 3 hours later than the second peak of transport , and the slope of these two peaks is almost identical . in addition , when we compare traffic patterns of transport hot spots and business district shown in figure  [ fig : interrelationship ] , we find that the peak in business district takes place in the time period between the two peaks of transport hot spots .",
    "both observations suggest that the traffic patterns in these three areas are related .",
    "these three traffic patterns probably depict the daily routine of working populations , for them rush through heavy traffic area to work in morning and rush back home in evening .    in the third row of figure",
    "[ fig : interrelationship ] , blue line stands for the traffic pattern in comprehensive area , and red line stands for the average traffic pattern of all cell towers .",
    "in fact , we find that these two patterns are of great similarity , which suggests that comprehensive area really is a mixture of other four kinds of functional areas .",
    "[ t ]        in this section , we conduct frequency - domain analysis .",
    "such frequency - domain analysis is motivated by observing the inherent time - domain periodicity of traffic and the disadvantages of pure time - domain traffic analysis , where time - domain traffic identification is not easy , especially when cellular towers are deployed in the comprehensive areas with couples of behaviors .",
    "for example , we know that traffic of cellular tower in the office area reaches the valley in weekends , and traffic of cellular tower in transport area has two peaks in one day , but for an arbitrary cellular tower which has both characteristics , we do not know which of the two will predominate",
    ". on the other hand , in frequency domain , we can quantify these characteristics by using the amplitude and phase of frequency corresponding to one day and one week .",
    "thus , we can grasp the key points and compare the strength of different characteristics of traffic for one cellular tower , which is not intuitive in time domain . here ,",
    "a natural question to ask is what are the most discriminating and essential features to present traffic patterns of cellular towers .",
    "motivated by answering this question , we conduct frequency domain analysis on the five extracted patterns and reveal several important discoveries .      in order to analyze the strong periodicity existing in time domain , we first carry out discrete fourier transform ( dft ) on the time - domain traffic vector .",
    "can be formulated as the following : @xmath16=\\sum_{n=1}^{n}x[n]e^{-2\\pi ikn / n},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the number of traffic samples , that is as discussed before in our analysis .",
    "@xmath18 $ ] is the frequency spectrum of time - domain traffic @xmath19 .",
    "shows the dft , where three peaks are observed , @xmath20 @xmath214 , 28 , 56 .",
    "the absolute values of the three components are much higher than the rest of points , which suggests that most information of the time - domain traffic could be retained by the three components . motivated by this hint",
    ", we use the three components for presenting the time - domain traffic . to evaluate the information loss of ignoring the rest of frequency components ,",
    "we reconstruct the time - domain traffic using the three main frequency components , which is expressed as follows : @xmath22\\!=\\!\\ !",
    "\\begin{cases } \\hat{x}[k],&\\!\\ !   \\text{if $ k=$0 , 4 , 28 , 56 , $ n$-4 , $ n$-28 , $ n$-56 , } \\\\ 0,&\\!\\ !",
    "\\text{otherwise , } \\end{cases}\\\\\\\\ x^r[n]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\hat{x}^r[k]e^{2\\pi ikn / n } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    @xmath23=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\hat{x}^r[k]e^{2\\pi ikn / n},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 $ ] is the reconstructed time - domain traffic . from the result",
    ", we can observe that the reconstructed curve is very close to the original curve .",
    "specifically , the lost energy , @xmath25 ^ 2-\\sum_{n=1}^n x[n]^2 $ ] , is less than 6% relative to the total energy of the original traffic @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] , which suggests the negligible energy contributed by frequency components beyond the three main components .",
    "[ bth ]        [ bth ]        to further understand the capability of signal reconstruction using the three points , we analyze the variance of amplitude of dft at each frequency component we can observe that the dft variances of the three frequency components are larger compared to the rest . in addition , we use the dft to analyse in figure  [ fig : fexa4 ] . we can find that the reconstructed curves are also very close to the original curves , and their dft spectrum varies most significantly at the three frequency components , which suggests that these three frequencies are the most important components in distinguishing towers of different traffic patterns as well as constructing a time - domain traffic .      in order to better understand the five traffic patterns of towers in frequency domain , we now provide visualized frequency analysis of them . in addition , based on our earlier observation in section  5.1 , we only analyze the three frequencies corresponding to one week , one day , and half a day .",
    "since each dft point is a complex number , we analyze the distribution of its amplitude and phase extracted by the following expressions : @xmath27||,\\\\ p^m_k = arg\\ x^m[k ] , \\end{cases } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the amplitude and phase of dft for tower @xmath30 at the @xmath31 frequency component .    figure  [ fig : app ] shows the distribution of the amplitude and phase of towers deployed in the comprehensive , residential , office , transport , and entertainment areas .",
    "meanwhile , means and standard deviations of the amplitude and phase for towers at the three frequency components of towers in the 4 types of areas are presented in figure  [ fig : appp ] .    from figure",
    "[ fig : app](a ) and figure  [ fig : appp](a ) , we can observe that towers in office area have the strongest periodicity of one week .",
    "their phases mainly concentrate around 1.35 , while the phase of towers in residential and entertainment area centers around -1.65 , about @xmath32 away from 1.35 .",
    "this @xmath32 separation suggests that towers in residential and entertainment area have reverse traffic characteristics as that in the office area .",
    "as we can observe in figure  [ fig : app](b ) , the distribution of towers is continuous with respect to the phase of one day .",
    "moreover , it shows a smooth traffic transition from residential area to comprehensive and transport area , and finally to office area . on the other hand , according to our priori knowledge , the human migration flow usually leads to the peaks of traffic of areas appear sequentially with the same order that the flow passes through , which coincides with our observed phenomenon .",
    "thus , such transition suggests the human migration flow from home to office via transport during rush hours . in figure",
    "[ fig : appp](b ) , we can also observe that the means of their phase are incremental with the same order .",
    "figure  [ fig : app](c ) and figure  [ fig : appp](c ) show characteristics of the amplitude and phase of the frequency component which stands for half a day .",
    "the amplitude of this frequency component indicates the strength of double - hump characteristic . in figure",
    "[ fig : appp](c ) , we can observe that the amplitude of towers in transport area is the largest , indicating their strongest double - hump characteristic .",
    "this result coincides with our priori knowledge that there are two rush hours of transport area in the morning and evening , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : app](c ) , we find that traffic of residential and office area are not separated by traffic of transport area .",
    "this observation is not contradictory to our pervious analysis because the directions of people commute in the morning and afternoon are reversed .",
    "overall , the amplitude and phase of the three frequency components show a strong capability of differentiating towers with different traffic patterns .",
    "based on the observations , we make the following statements .",
    "first , the most representative tower in each cluster is not the centroid .",
    "in fact , it is the farthest non - noise point from the hyperplanes , which separate clusters . to understand this problem ,",
    "let us think about the points around a hyperplane , where we observe similar traffic patterns of points even though they belong to different clusters .",
    "in geographical context , these towers are deployed in areas of mixed urban functions .",
    "in contrast , the points far from the separating hyperplane are located at areas of a single urban function .",
    "although perhaps not the most representative points , cluster centroids can well characterize the traffic patterns since they are distant from others clusters .",
    "second , the frequency - domain features of towers are distributed in a polygon .",
    "such polygon is formed because the profile of each cluster in figure  [ fig : app ] has a cigar shape .",
    "thus , different features of towers can be regarded as being linear relevant or piecewise linear relevant approximately , which overlayed with a gaussian noise can form the cluster with the cigar shape . as a result , a point in the frequency domain can be seen as a linear combination of the four vertex of the polygon , @xmath20 , the four most representative points , which we call as the four primary components .    to illustrate these two statements",
    ", we plot the distribution of towers and corresponding polygon in figure  [ fig : pol ] . for better understanding ,",
    "we only show three features , including amplitude and phase of one day , and amplitude of half day . according to our first statement ,",
    "the most representative tower in each cluster is the furthest one from the hyperplane .",
    "in addition , we use the density of the towers , i.e. , the number of towers within a fixed distance away from in the feature space , as a decision function to ensure that is not a noise point .",
    "figure  [ fig : pol ] shows that all the towers are distributed in or along the edge and plane of the polygon , as we discussed above .",
    "[ t ]        by looking at the coefficient of each primary component , we can obtain the percentage of corresponding urban function of the area where an arbitrary cellular tower is deployed .",
    "we formulate the process of obtaining the coefficients as a quadratic programming problem , which is shown below : @xmath33 where ||@xmath34|| is the 2-norm of a vector , @xmath35 is the feature of the target tower , @xmath36 is the feature of the most representative tower for cluster @xmath8 in the frequency domain , and @xmath37 is the obtained coefficient for cluster @xmath8 . in this example , the feature of tower @xmath30 , @xmath38 , is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the amplitude of one day , phase of one day , and amplitude of half a day for tower @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we use the quadratic programming to solve the problem because the traffic of an actual tower is usually overlayed with various noises , such that these points close to the plane of the the polygon may be driven out of the polygon . by solving this quadratic programming , for points inside the polygon",
    ", we can find their exact convex combinations , while for some point outside the polygon , we can find the point in the polygon with the smallest distance to the target point , which is a good approximation .",
    "we dedicatedly select a list of towers in the comprehensive area .",
    "then , we use the method presented above to solve the convex combinatorial coefficients of them .",
    "we compare these coefficients with a transform of the previously introduced poi , @xmath20 , the term frequency - inverse document frequency ( tf - idf ) of the corresponding types and locations .",
    "tf - idf is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document .",
    "specifically , tf - idf can be calculated as the following : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total number of towers , and @xmath45 is the number of towers of which the poi of type @xmath8 appears within a specific distance , and poi@xmath46 is the times that the poi of type @xmath8 appears within a fixed distance of tower @xmath30 . to be better compared with ,",
    "we normalize the tf - idf of each tower by the sum of tf - idf of all the four types for this tower , which is called as the normalized tf - idf ( ntf - idf ) .",
    "this process can be formulated as the following : @xmath47 the obtained ntf - idf is proportional to the poi for each type , which roughly represents the density of the corresponding function in the corresponding area .",
