    "one of the most important goals of current cosmological studies is to unveil the nature of the mechanism behind cosmic acceleration . in principle , the most promising explanations involve either the existence of new fields in high energy physics or large - scale modifications of gravity theory . following the former route , several possibilities have been discussed in the literature , among them a possible interaction between the dark matter and the smooth dark energy component , permitting transfer of energy between these two fields and violating adiabaticity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if the dark energy component is the vacuum energy density @xmath5 , characterised by an equation - of - state parameter @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the pressure , these scenarios may constitute not only a phenomenological attempt at alleviating the so - called coincidence problem , since dark matter and dark energy are no longer assumed to be independent , but also the unsettled situation in the particle physics / cosmology interface , in which the cosmological upper bound for @xmath5 differs from theoretical expectations ( @xmath8 ) by more than 100 orders of magnitude ( see @xcite for a discussion on the cosmological constant problems ) . from the physical viewpoint , it worth mentioning that no known symmetry in nature prevents a non - minimal coupling between these components .",
    "therefore , although no observational piece of evidence has so far been unambiguously presented for an interaction in the cosmological dark sector , a weak coupling still below current detection can not be completely excluded .    given the theoretical implications of such a detection for cosmology , it is important to investigate ways to probe this possibility from observations .",
    "our goal in this paper is to propose and explore a low-@xmath0 test for a possible dark matter / dark energy interaction from measurements of the gas mass fraction @xmath1 in relaxed and massive galaxy clusters .",
    "the test proposed is model - independent in the sense that in the low-@xmath0 regime the @xmath1 equations become independent of the interacting model , although the signature of a non - minimally coupled remains present .",
    "we apply the test to the current data and investigate the constraining power of future @xmath1 measurements from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "we also discuss the necessary conditions in terms of number and accuracy of upcoming data for a successful application of the test . in",
    "what follows , we outline the main assumptions of our analysis and discuss the main results .",
    "in ou analysis , we assume a non - minimal coupling between the cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a dark energy component ( @xmath9 ) with @xmath10 ( baryons and radiation are assumed to be separately conserved , implying the usual scaling @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the evolution of the mean dark matter density @xmath13 and of @xmath5 are obtained from the balance equations @xmath14 @xmath15 where a dot denotes derivative with respect to time , @xmath16 is the hubble parameter and @xmath3 is the cosmological scale factor , written in terms of the redshift parameter as @xmath17 . in the absence of a natural guidance from fundamental physics on the interaction function @xmath18 , which controls the rate of energy transfer , several phenomenological forms have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "an interesting approach was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the time variation of @xmath9 is deduced from its effect on the cdm evolution .",
    "the qualitative argument is the following : since @xmath9 is decaying into cdm particles , cdm will necessarily dilute more slowly compared to its standard evolution , @xmath19 .",
    "thus , if the deviation from the standard evolution is characterised by a constant @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 eqs.([c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) yield @xmath22 which is equivalent to the dark energy evolution found if one assumes @xmath23 ( from now on , the subscript 0 denotes present - day quantities ) .",
    "note that a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath20 leads to a slower ( faster ) dilution of the matter component , which implies in an energy transfer from @xmath9 ( cdm ) to cdm ( @xmath9 ) ( for thermodynamic constraints on the sign of @xmath20 , we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "a more general parameterisation for the interaction parameter was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which this quantity is assumed to be an arbitrary function of the scale factor , i.e. , @xmath24 . in this case , regardless of the interaction function @xmath18 a given theory may provide or , equivalently , of its effect on the cdm evolution , @xmath13 can always be parameterised in terms of @xmath25 .",
    "note also that this approach can be applied even if the dark energy component has an arbitrary equation - of - state parameter ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "observations of the gas mass fraction in relaxed and massive galaxy clusters have been widely used as a cosmological test ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the key assumption of this test is that the baryonic mass fraction in galaxy clusters provides a fair sample of the distribution of baryons at large scale @xcite .",
    "the mass fraction of hot gas measured within a characteristic radius of a halo at redshift @xmath0 can be written as @xmath27^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the baryon and cdm density parameters as function of @xmath0 and the angular diameter distance ( @xmath30 ) ratio accounts for deviations in the geometry of the universe between the fiducial model adopted in the observations and the model to be tested taking into account possible violations of the so - called distance duality relation , see @xcite . ] .",
    "the term @xmath31 accounts for star formation and other baryon effects within the characteristic radius under the assumption that @xmath32 should be approximately constant with redshift ( for a discussion of the systematics errors included on @xmath31 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "many forms of @xmath31 have been adopted in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", for the test discussed here the exact form or value of @xmath31 is not important , so that we marginalise over it in all the analyses presented in the next sections .",
    "regardless of the cosmological models involved in the analysis , the distance ratio above equals unity in the cosmographic limit ( @xmath33 ) . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath34 , the baryon - to - total - mass density ratio @xmath35 $ ] becomes constant , as the baryons and cdm density parameters have the same @xmath0 dependence . on the other hand , under the assumptions discussed earlier ,",
    "if there is a non - minimal coupling in the cosmological dark sector the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath36 where the extra term @xmath37 makes @xmath38 no longer constant , providing a direct test to the idea of an interacting dark energy field . in reality , this test can be applied to any scenario whose dilution of dark matter is modified with respect to the usual @xmath2 scaling , regardless whether it is due to an interacting or any other physical process . here , however , for simplicity , we will restrict our analysis to the case in which a non - minimal coupling in the dark sector is parameterised by a constant interacting parameter @xmath20 , as given in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "in our analysis , we consider the chandra @xmath32 data analysed in @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "originally , this sample comprises @xmath39 regular , relatively relaxed and massive galaxy clusters distributed over a wide range of redshift ( @xmath40 ) .      in order to implement the low-@xmath0 test of eq .",
    "( [ fgaslowz ] ) , we first study the redshift interval in which the cosmographic condition above is satisfied .",
    "the fiducial model used in the observations was a flat @xmath9cdm scenario with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "thus , considering @xmath42 , given by current cmb experiments @xcite , we show in figure 1b the quantity @xmath43 \\times 100\\%$ ] , where @xmath20cdm stands for the interacting model discussed in sec .",
    "ii with the values of @xmath20 and @xmath44 fixed at the best - fit values given by eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath32 data up to @xmath45 , which corresponds to a dispersion of @xmath46 for the angular diameter ratio of eq .",
    "( [ fgas ] ) .",
    "such value is negligible when compared with current observational uncertainties ( @xmath47 ) and restricts our working sample to @xmath48 clusters ( fig .",
    "1a ) interval is possible only because the fiducial model used in the @xmath32 observations and the best - fit scenario found below [ eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) ] predict very similar @xmath49 evolution . however , the most general way to define the test of eq .",
    "( [ fgaslowz ] ) is through the cosmographic limit discussed above . ] .    considering this sub - sample , we perform a @xmath50 analysis : @xmath51^{2}}{\\sigma^2_{f^{obs}_{gas } } } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the theoretical expression for @xmath32 at low-@xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ fgaslowz ] ) and @xmath53 is the error in the @xmath54 measurements . from this analysis , we find @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( @xmath57 stands for the number of degrees of freedom ) . clearly , the current data are unable to unambiguously detect or rule out a non - minimal coupling in the cosmological dark sector . in",
    "what follows , we perform mc simulations to discuss the necessary conditions ( i.e. , number of @xmath32 data points and improvements on the relative error measurement @xmath58 ) to detect such a coupling at a given confidence level .",
    "we expect that the larger the number of @xmath32 data points or the smaller their error @xmath59 , the smaller the uncertainty on the interacting parameter @xmath60 should be .",
    "thus , in order to find which are the necessary improvements in future observations to check the hypothesis of a non - minimal coupling in the cosmological dark sector , we generate synthetic samples of @xmath32 measurements assuming the distribution and redshift interval of the current observations .",
    "the steps of the simulations are the following : we first define the number of points ( @xmath61 ) to be simulated .",
    "then , we simulate a sample of @xmath62 measurements , with @xmath61 points in the same redshift range of the current data . for each point simulated",
    "we assume a normal distribution @xmath63 , with a mean value and error defined as the fiducial values .",
    "the relative errors for @xmath32 are obtained assuming that the relative error provided by observations can be fitted by a polynomial to find its redshift dependence .",
    "we performed @xmath64 realisations for each one of the analyses described below .",
    "we first study the evolution of the figure - of - merit , defined as fom = @xmath65 , as function of the number of data points in the range [ 50 - 250 ] . using the simulated data we perform @xmath50 analyses and find the best - fit values for the pair ( @xmath20 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "we repeat this process @xmath64 times and calculate the mean and standard deviation of these parameters and the corresponding fom , for a fixed value of @xmath61 . the fiducial model used in the simulations",
    "has the parameters values given in eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) and the results are shown in fig .",
    "1c . from this analysis",
    ", we find that for a relatively small number of measurements when compared to future x - ray surveys , e.g. , @xmath66 , the fom value @xmath67 corresponds to an improvement of order of 3 with respect to the current data ( fom@xmath68 ) .",
    "this clearly shows that very tight bounds on the interacting parameter can be obtained from a larger sample of galaxy clusters x - ray observations .    in what follows",
    ", we will direct our analysis to the necessary improvements in future observations , i.e. , the number of galaxy clusters @xmath61 and the relative error of the gas mass fraction @xmath58 , to observationally distinguish between values of @xmath20 of the order of current estimates and the standard value @xmath34 . besides assuming the best - fit values given in eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) as fiducial values , our simulations always assume the distribution and relative error of the current @xmath32 sample shown in fig",
    ". 1a .    under such conditions ,",
    "the simulation process provides the number of data points @xmath69 necessary to verify the hypothesis of a non - minimal coupling in the cosmological dark sector . in order to find @xmath69",
    ", we adopt the criterion @xmath70 , where @xmath71 corresponds to the confidence level ( number of standard deviations ) required .",
    "the results are shown in the fig .",
    "as expected , the error bar for the interaction parameter decreases for higher values of @xmath61 . for @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "we find @xmath74 , which clearly illustrates the viability of implementation of the test procedure in the near future since a value of @xmath75 is expected in some planned x - ray surveys .",
    "it is worth noticing that such result is somehow conservative since no improvement on the upcoming @xmath32 data relative to the current ones was considered to derive the above value of @xmath69 .    in order to study the influence of the uncertainties of @xmath32 measurements on the estimates of @xmath69",
    ", we also vary the relative error @xmath58 with @xmath61 , considering the interval between @xmath76 of the current observational value .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "2b , where 100% means the present - day value .",
    "clearly , by improving the quality of the data or , equivalently , decreasing their relative error , @xmath69 becomes considerably smaller .",
    "as an example , decreasing the relative error in 50% , we find @xmath77 , which corresponds to 1/3 of the previous value obtained when the relative error of the current @xmath32 data ( @xmath78 ) is considered . for @xmath79 , which corresponds to the number of @xmath32 measurements currently available , the improvement on @xmath58 needed to distinguish coupled from uncoupled dark energy is of the order of 25% relative to the present observational value .",
    "these results indicate that improvements in the relative error of @xmath32 observations are more effective to achieve this goal than an increase in the size of the sample .",
    "testing a possible non - minimal coupling between the dark matter and dark energy fields constitutes an important task for cosmology and fundamental physics . in this paper , we have proposed and applied a new , model - independent test for this hypothesis using low-@xmath0 measurements of the gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters .",
    "as well known , the transfer of energy between the dark components necessarily modifies the dilution of dark matter with respect to the usual @xmath2 scaling whereas the baryonic component remains separately conserved ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , the test here proposed can in principle be applied to any model of this class or even to cosmologies in which the attenuated dilution of the cdm component results from another physical process .",
    "this is possible because in the low-@xmath0 regime the @xmath1 equations become cosmological model - independent , although the signature of a non - standard cdm evolution remains present .",
    "since the current observational data can not unambiguously detect any interaction between the dark components , we have used the present bounds given by eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) as fiducial values and performed mc simulations to study the necessary requirements for a @xmath80 detection .",
    "we have then generated thousands of @xmath1 samples assuming the present observational error distribution , as described in sec .",
    "v. after discussing the gain in the fom with the number of data points @xmath61 in the synthetic sample , we have investigated the number and accuracy of future observations needed for a successful application of the test . for the simplest case in which @xmath20 = const .",
    ", adopted in our analysis , and considering the relative error @xmath58 of current data , we have found that the minimum number of data points necessary to distinguish between an interacting and a non - interacting dark energy component should be @xmath81 times larger than the current observational sample ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "this number , however , is much smaller than the number of galaxy clusters expected to be observed by the extended roentgen survey with an imaging telescope array ( erosita ) , which clearly shows the viability of implementation of this @xmath32 test in the near future .",
    "we have also calculated how @xmath69 changes as the relative error of @xmath32 measurements improves . as shown in fig .",
    "2b , decreasing @xmath58 by a factor of 2 leads to @xmath77 , which is three times smaller than the value found assuming the relative error of the current @xmath32 data .",
    "these results clearly show that a combination of quantity and precision of future @xmath32 measurements can become an important tool not only to probe a possible interaction in the cosmological dark sector but also to explore its consequences .",
