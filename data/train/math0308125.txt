    "these individuals are interesting because of their dimension , five , and the value , @xmath7 , of their volume .",
    "the volumes of our 5-manifolds are interesting because the value of the riemann zeta function at three , @xmath8 , is known to be an irrational number [ 11 ] , in contrast to dimension three , where the irrationality of volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is unknown .",
    "our manifolds are explicitly described by gluing together the sides of a hyperbolic convex polytope .",
    "these manifolds are the first examples of explicitly described complete hyperbolic 5-manifolds of finite volume .",
    "one of our examples has a group of symmetries of order 16 that acts freely on the manifold .",
    "the resulting quotient hyperbolic 5-manifold has volume , @xmath6 , which is the smallest known volume of a complete hyperbolic 5-manifold .",
    "the previous smallest known volume was @xmath9 which is the volume of a hyperbolic 5-manifold constructed by b. everitt [ 1 ] .",
    "a volume lower bound of r. kellerhals [ 3 ] suggests that our quotient manifold has very small volume and may be a minimum volume open hyperbolic 5-manifold .",
    "see our paper [ 9 ] , for the volumes of some arithmetic hyperbolic @xmath10-manifolds .",
    "we now set up notation .",
    "a real @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 is said to be _ lorentzian _ if @xmath12 preserves the _",
    "lorentzian inner product _ @xmath13",
    "the _ hyperboloid model _ of hyperbolic @xmath14-space is the metric space @xmath15 with metric @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 a lorentzian @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 is said to be either _ positive _ or _ negative _ according as @xmath12 maps @xmath18 to @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the isometries of @xmath18 correspond to the positive lorentzian @xmath11 matrices .",
    "let @xmath20 be the group of positive lorentzian @xmath21 matrices with integer entries .",
    "the group @xmath20 is an infinite discrete subgroup of the group @xmath22 of lorentzian @xmath21 matrices .",
    "the _ principal congruence two subgroup _ of @xmath20 is the group @xmath23 of all matrices in @xmath20 that are congruent to the identity matrix modulo two .",
    "the congruence two subgroup @xmath23 is not torsion - free , but it only has 2-torsion by theorem ix.7 of newman [ 5 ] .",
    "in this section , we determine the structure of the congruence two subgroup @xmath2 of the group @xmath3 of integral , positive , lorentzian @xmath24 matrices . before reading this section ,",
    "we advise the reader to read the first four sections of our paper [ 10 ] which determines the structure of @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "vinberg [ 12 ] proved that the group @xmath3 is a reflection group with respect to a noncompact 5-simplex @xmath27 in @xmath5 whose coxeter diagram is    ( 210,80)(-80,-50 ) ( -48,7)3 ( -75,0 ) ( -75,0)(1,0)50 ( -2,7)3 ( -25,0)(1,0)50 ( -25,0 ) ( 25,0 ) ( 48,7)3 ( 25,0)(1,0)50 ( 75,0 ) ( 32,-26)3 ( 25,0)(0,-1)48 ( 25,-48 ) ( 75,0)(1,0)50 ( 75,0 ) ( 125,0 ) ( 98,7)4    the volume of @xmath27 is @xmath28 , see [ 9 ] .",
    "vertices for @xmath27 are @xmath29 the group @xmath3 is generated by the following six matrices that represent the reflections of @xmath5 in the sides of @xmath27 , @xmath30",
    "@xmath31    let @xmath32 be the group generated the first five matrices in the above list of matrices .",
    "then @xmath32 is the group generated by the reflections in the sides of @xmath27 incident with the vertex @xmath33 .",
    "therefore @xmath32 is isomorphic to a spherical 4-simplex reflection group whose coxeter diagram is obtained from the coxeter diagram of @xmath2 by deleting its right most vertex and its adjoining edge . hence @xmath32 has the coxeter diagram    ( 160,80)(-80,-50 ) ( -48,7)3 ( -75,0 ) ( -75,0)(1,0)50 ( -2,7)3 ( -25,0)(1,0)50 ( -25,0 ) ( 25,0 ) ( 48,7)3 ( 25,0)(1,0)50 ( 75,0 ) ( 32,-26)3 ( 25,0)(0,-1)48 ( 25,-48 )    the order of the coxeter group @xmath32 is 1920",
    ". none of the elements of @xmath32 are in @xmath2 . by lemma 16 of [ 9 ] ,",
    "the index of @xmath34 in @xmath3 is 1920 .",
    "hence @xmath32 is a set of coset representatives for @xmath34 in @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore have a natural , split , short , exact sequence of groups @xmath35    let @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath37 is a convex hyperbolic polytope which is subdivided into 1920 copies of @xmath27 obtained by reflecting in the sides of @xmath27 that are incident with the vertex @xmath33 .",
    "the polytope @xmath37 has 16 actual vertices and 10 ideal vertices .",
    "the ideal vertices are @xmath38 the 10 ideal vertices of @xmath37 are the vertices of a regular ideal 5-dimensional cross polytope @xmath39 centered at the point @xmath33 .",
    "the regular cross polytope @xmath39 has 32 sides each of which is a regular ideal 4-simplex .",
    "let @xmath40 be the standard basis of @xmath41 and let @xmath42 be the 5-simplex in @xmath5 with one actual vertex at the origin @xmath43 of @xmath5 and five ideal vertices @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "we call @xmath42 a _ corner _ 5-_simplex _ , with @xmath43 the _ corner vertex _ of @xmath42 , and each side of @xmath42 incident with @xmath43 a _ corner side _ of @xmath42 .",
    "the 5-simplex @xmath42 has five corner sides .",
    "the sixth side of @xmath42 is a regular ideal 4-simplex .",
    "the dihedral angle between any two corner sides of @xmath42 is a right angle .",
    "the dihedral angle between the ideal side of @xmath42 and a corner side is @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath42 is a hyperbolic coxeter simplex .",
    "the regular ideal cross polytope @xmath39 is subdivided into 32 copies of @xmath42 fitting together around their corner vertices at the point @xmath33 .",
    "each side of @xmath39 is the ideal side of one of the 32 corner simplices subdividing @xmath39 .",
    "the dihedral angles between the ideal sides and a common corner side of two adjacent corner simplices subdividing @xmath39 add up to the dihedral angle @xmath47 of @xmath39 .",
    "the polytope @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath39 by gluing onto each of 16 mutually nonadjacent sides of @xmath39 a corner 5-simplex with one of the attached corner 5-simplices being @xmath42 .",
    "the corner vertices of the attached corner 5-simplices are the actual vertices of @xmath37 .",
    "the actual vertices of @xmath37 are @xmath48 the polytope @xmath37 has 16 sides .",
    "the remaining 16 sides of @xmath39 extend to the 16 sides of @xmath37 .",
    "each of these 16 sides of @xmath39 is a regular ideal 4-simplex which is coplanar with a corner side of five of the attached corner 5-simplices .",
    "thus each side of @xmath37 is obtained from a regular ideal 4-simplex @xmath49 by gluing on a corner 4-simplex onto each side of @xmath49 .",
    "hence , each side of @xmath37 is congruent to the polytope @xmath50 described in our paper [ 10 ] .",
    "the group of symmetries of @xmath36 is @xmath32 which is a subgroup of index two of the group of symmetries of @xmath39 .",
    "the dihedral angles of @xmath37 are the dihedral angles of the attached corner 5-simplices between corner sides , and so @xmath37 is a right - angled polytope .",
    "it is worth noting that l. potyagailo and e. vinberg [ 6 ] have proven that a 5-dimensional , right - angled , hyperbolic polytope of finite volume has at least 16 sides , and so @xmath37 is a 5-dimensional , right - angled , hyperbolic polytope of finite volume with the smallest possible number of sides .",
    "the polytope @xmath37 has 16 sides , five of them are coplaner with the coordinate hyperplanes @xmath51 , for @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the last generator of @xmath27 .",

    "the reflections of @xmath5 in the 16 sides of @xmath37 are represented by matrices of the form @xmath56 with @xmath12 in @xmath32 .",
    "each such matrix @xmath56 is in @xmath2 , since @xmath2 is a normal subgroup of @xmath3 .",
    "now since @xmath32 is a set of coset representatives for @xmath34 in @xmath3 , we have that @xmath36 is a fundamental polytope for @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore have the following theorem .",
    "the congruence two subgroup @xmath34 of the group @xmath3 of integral , positive , lorentzian @xmath24 matrices is a reflection group with respect to the right - angled polytope @xmath37 .",
    "we now describe the 16 matrices that represent the reflections of @xmath5 in the sides of @xmath37 .",
    "five of the sides of @xmath37 are coplanar with the coordinate hyperplanes @xmath51 , for @xmath52 .",
    "the reflections in the five coordinate hyperplanes are represented by diagonal matrices with diagonal entries all 1 except for a @xmath57 in the @xmath58th diagonal slot .",
    "the polytope @xmath37 has 10 sides each of which is perpendicular to three of the coordinate hyperplanes in all 10 combinations of three coordinate hyperplanes .",
    "the matrices representing the reflections in these 10 sides are obtained from the matrix @xmath59 by conjugating by a permutation matrix of the first five coordinates .",
    "note that the three diagonal ones can lie in any one of the 10 combinations of three diagonal positions in the first five diagonal slots .",
    "the remaining side of @xmath37 is not incident with any of the coordinate hyperplanes .",
    "we call this side the _ far side _ of @xmath37 .",
    "the reflection of @xmath5 in the far side of @xmath37 is represented by the matrix @xmath60 let @xmath61 be the group of 32 diagonal matrices @xmath62 then @xmath61 is a subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "the next corollary follows immediately from theorem 1 .",
    "every nonidentity element of @xmath34 of finite order has order two , every finite subgroup of @xmath34 is conjugate in @xmath3 to a subgroup of the elementary 2-group @xmath61 , and there are 16 conjugacy classes of maximal finite subgroups of @xmath34 in @xmath34 corresponding to the 16 actual vertices of @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a torsion - free subgroup of @xmath2 of finite index .",
    "then the finite group @xmath61 acts freely on the set of cosets of @xmath1 in @xmath2 by @xmath63 , since @xmath1 is torsion - free . therefore @xmath64 divides @xmath65 $ ] .    now suppose that @xmath65 = 32 $ ] .",
    "then the convex polytope @xmath66 is a fundamental polytope for @xmath1 .",
    "the polytope is subdivided into 32 copies of @xmath37 , one of which is @xmath37 , that fit together around the origin @xmath43 of @xmath5 , with one copy of @xmath37 in each of the 32 orthants of @xmath5 bounded by five coordinate hyperplanes of @xmath5 .",
    "the polytope @xmath67 has 72 sides of two different types .",
    "a side of @xmath37 lying in a coordinate hyperplane is identified with a side of the copy of @xmath37 across the coordinate hyperplane .",
    "this eliminates @xmath68 sides of the 32 copies of @xmath37 subdividing @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath69 be a side of @xmath37 that is perpendicular to three coordinate hyperplanes and let @xmath70 be the subgroup of @xmath61 generated by the reflections in the three coordinate hyperplanes perpendicular to @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath70 leaves the hyperplane of @xmath5 spanned by @xmath69 invariant .",
    "hence the eight sides @xmath71 of the copies of @xmath37 subdividing @xmath67 are coplanar .",
    "these eight copies of @xmath50 form a side @xmath72 of @xmath67 .",
    "the intersection of the eight copies of @xmath50 forming @xmath72 is a hyperbolic line which we call the _ axis _ of the side @xmath72 of @xmath67 .",
    "the axis of the side @xmath72 is an edge of @xmath69 joining two ideal vertices @xmath44 and @xmath73 of @xmath69 .",
    "there are a total of 40 sides of @xmath67 of this type which accounts for @xmath74 sides of the 32 copies of @xmath37 subdividing @xmath67 .",
    "now @xmath61 maps the far side of @xmath37 to 32 sides of @xmath67 that are congruent to @xmath50 .",
    "this accounts for all of the @xmath75 sides of the 32 copies of @xmath37 subdividing @xmath67 .",
    "thus @xmath67 has a total of 72 sides , 32 small sides congruent to @xmath50 , and 40 large sides made up of eight copies of @xmath50 glued together around a common infinite edge .",
    "the axes of the 40 large sides of @xmath67 are the edges of the regular ideal 5-dimensional cross polytope @xmath76 with vertices @xmath77 , for @xmath52 .",
    "there is one small side of @xmath67 in each of the 32 orthants of @xmath5 bounded by five coordinate hyperplanes .",
    "the small sides of @xmath67 are pairwise disjoint .",
    "the polytope @xmath67 has the same symmetry group as the regular cross polytope @xmath76 .",
    "all the dihedral angles of the sides of @xmath67 are right angles and all the dihedral angles of @xmath67 are right angles .",
    "let @xmath69 be a side of @xmath67 and let @xmath78 be the reflection of @xmath18 in the side @xmath69 .",
    "then there is a reflection @xmath79 in a side of @xmath37 and an element @xmath80 of @xmath61 such that @xmath81 .",
    "hence @xmath78 is in @xmath2 .",
    "now since @xmath61 is a set of coset representatives for @xmath1 in @xmath2 , there is an element @xmath82 of @xmath1 and an element @xmath83 of @xmath61 such that @xmath84 . then @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath86 is a side - pairing transformation in @xmath1 for @xmath67 that pairs the side @xmath87 of @xmath67 to the side @xmath69 of @xmath67 . summarizing , we have the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath1 be a torsion - free subgroup of @xmath2 of index 32 .",
    "then the right - angled polytope @xmath67 is an exact fundamental polytope for @xmath1 .",
    "the side - pairing transformations of @xmath67 are of the form @xmath86 where @xmath83 is in @xmath61 and @xmath78 is the reflection in a side of @xmath67 .",

    "the 160 actual vertices are obtained from @xmath89 by permuting the first five coordinates .",
    "the ten ideal vertices @xmath90 of the regular cross polytope @xmath76 are ideal vertices of @xmath67 , which we call _ large ideal vertices_. each large ideal vertex is a vertex of eight large sides and no small sides .",
    "all the other ideal vertices of @xmath67 are ideal vertices of small sides , with each ideal vertex shared by two small sides in adjacent orthants , for a total of @xmath91 ideal vertices of small sides , which we call _ small ideal vertices_. the 80 small ideal vertices are obtained from @xmath92 by permuting the first five coordinates .",

    "all the dihedral angles of @xmath93 are right angles .",
    "the polytope @xmath67 has @xmath95 small ridges congruent to @xmath93 .",
    "each small ridge is a side of just one small side of @xmath67 and just one large side of @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath96 be adjacent sides of @xmath37 that are both perpendicular to three coordinate hyperplanes .",
    "these two sets of three coordinate hyperplanes have two hyperplanes in common .",
    "the intersection of @xmath69 and @xmath96 is a ridge @xmath97 of @xmath37 , and so @xmath97 is congruent to @xmath93 .",
    "now @xmath97 is perpendicular to the two common coordinate hyperplanes and lies in the other two coordinate hyperplanes .",
    "let @xmath98 be the subgroup of @xmath61 generated by the reflections in the two coordinate hyperplanes perpendicular to @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath98 leaves the 3-plane of @xmath5 spanned by @xmath97 invariant . hence the four ridges @xmath99 of copies of @xmath37 subdividing @xmath67 are coplanar .",
    "these four copies of @xmath93 form a ridge @xmath100 of @xmath67 .",
    "the intersection of the four copies of @xmath93 forming @xmath100 is a hyperbolic ray which we call the _ axis _ of the ridge @xmath100 of @xmath67 .",
    "the axis of the ridge @xmath100 is an edge of @xmath97 joining a large ideal vertex to an actual vertex of @xmath97 .",
    "the polyhedron @xmath100 is congruent to the top half of the rhombic dodecahedron @xmath101 in figure 5 of our paper [ 10 ] . see figure 2 .",
    "the polyhedron @xmath100 has nine vertices , four actual and five ideal , and nine sides , four triangles congruent to @xmath94 , four rhombi made up of two copies of @xmath94 glued together along a line edge , and an ideal square congruent to @xmath102 .",

    "a large side of @xmath67 has 20 sides , eight small sides in common with adjacent small sides of @xmath67 and 12 large sides in common with adjacent large sides of @xmath67 .",

    "two adjacent large sides of @xmath96 , with a common ideal square face , have @xmath107 as an ideal vertex .",
    "hence the link of @xmath107 in @xmath96 is a rectangular box made up of two adjacent cubes .",
    "thus @xmath96 has four large sides and two small sides with ideal vertex @xmath107 .",
    "finally , the link of the small ideal @xmath107 in @xmath67 is a rectangular 4-box made up of two adjacent 4-cubes .",
    "thus @xmath67 has six large sides and two small sides with ideal vertex @xmath107 .",

    "each triangle face of @xmath67 is a face of a small side of @xmath67 .",
    "now @xmath93 has six faces congruent to @xmath94 and @xmath50 has ten sides congruent to @xmath93 .",
    "hence @xmath50 has 30 triangle faces .",

    "let @xmath111 be a rhombic face of @xmath67 .",
