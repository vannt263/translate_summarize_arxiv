    "ram pressure stripping ( rps hereafter ) by intracluster medium ( icm ; namely , x - ray emitting hot plasma in clusters of galaxies ) is one of the major mechanisms of gas removal from cluster member galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic materials , thus removed from the galaxies , form tail - like structures behind , which have been observed in , e.g. ,  ( e.g. , ) ,  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and x - ray bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a gas removal process may quench the star formation in galaxies , and expedite morphological transformation from spirals to s0s ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a plausible explanation to the observed environmental effects of cluster galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , details of the rps process are not yet clear from observational viewpoints , leaving a significant uncertainties in the current theoretical modelings .",
    "one of the best candidates for the observational rps study is a nearby spiral galaxy ngc 4388 ( n4388 hereafter ) .",
    "it is located at a projected distance of 1.3 degree away from the core of the virgo cluster ( m87 ) , and its radial velocity of @xmath6 km s@xmath7 is about by 1500 km s@xmath7 higher than that of m87 . such a high velocity is thought to have enhanced the rps in this object .",
    "in fact , as reported in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , n4388 is one of the most -deficient spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "recently , more intriguing rps features have been unveiled : @xcite discovered in  a plume of ionized gas extending 35 kpc to the northeast . moreover , as shown in , the stripped plume has an  counterpart with a larger extent of about 110 kpc ( @xmath8 ) , containing a mass of about 3.4 @xmath9 @xmath5 in the atomic phase . using an x - ray imaging analysis ,",
    "found an x - ray counterpart associated with the  and  tails .",
    "as suggested in , e.g , , the stripping may be due to an interaction with the icm of the virgo cluster at a projected distance of @xmath10 kpc from m87 .",
    "in contrast , og05 and proposed an alternative view : n4388 is interacting , at a speed @xmath11 km s@xmath7 , with the hot gas halo of the m86 group which is assumed to be located outside the virgo cluster .",
    "since m86 has a projected distance of only @xmath12 kpc from the plume , they can actually be very close in three dimensions .",
    "due to large systematic uncertainties on the line - of - sight distance of n4388 ( e.g. , 13.6 mpc from ; 19.2 mpc from @xcite ; and 38.7 mpc from ) , the origin of the stripping in n4388 remain unclear .",
    "the cold  plume , which has a column density sufficient to significantly absorb background x - ray photons , is found covering an x - ray bright , @xmath13  @xmath14  field in the central @xmath15  region of the m86 group ( og05 ) .",
    "this makes the x - ray absorption measurement a promising way to constrain the line - of - sight geometry between n4388 and m86 . for this purpose",
    ", we carried out a spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopic analysis on the m86-n4388 region .",
    "we assume a distance of 16.7 mpc to the virgo cluster , so that @xmath16 corresponds to about 4.86 kpc . for easy calculation ,",
    "the same values are assumed also for n4388 and m86 . unless stated otherwise , the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the m86 center and n4388 regions were observed with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) onboard _ xmm - newton _ , on 2002 july 1 and 2011 june 17 , respectively .",
    "the combined field of view covers the entire  cloud reported in og05 . basic reduction and calibration of the epic data",
    "were carried out with sas v12.0.1 . in the screening we set _",
    "flag_=0 , and kept events with _ patterns _ @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the mos and pn cameras , respectively . by examining lightcurves extracted in @xmath19 kev and @xmath20 kev from source - free regions , we rejected time intervals affected by hard- and soft - band flares , respectively , in which the count rate exceeds a 2@xmath21 limit above the quiescent mean value ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the obtained clean mos(pn ) exposures are 65(39 ) ks and 26(10 ) ks for the m86 and n4388 pointings , respectively .",
    "point sources detected by a sas tool edetect_chain were discarded in the spectral analysis .",
    "background was estimated as a combination of three independent components , i.e. , instrumental background , cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , and the galactic emission .",
    "following @xcite , we created the instrumental background spectra for all the epic data using a filter wheel closed dataset .",
    "the cxb and galactic emission components were calculated by analyzing spectra extracted from a region near the ccd edge of the n4388 pointing , which is about @xmath22 south of n4388 ( @xmath23 west of m87 ) . specifically , we first subtracted the instrumental background from the extracted spectra , and then fitted the resulting spectra with a model consisting of three components ; an absorbed power law model ( photon index @xmath24 ) describing the cxb , an absorbed optically thin thermal model with a temperature fixed at 0.2 kev and abundance at 1.0 @xmath25 for the galactic foreground , and another absorbed thermal model for the projected icm . a same absorption column density ( @xmath26 hereafter ) was applied to the three components .",
    "the best - fit temperature of the icm component is @xmath27 kev , which is consistent with the previous measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these fits constrained the @xmath28 kev cxb flux as 7.4 @xmath29 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath7 sr@xmath7 , which agrees with other reportings ( e.g. , @xcite ) . adopting the cxb brightness uncertainty of 6.2% for a 0.5 deg@xmath31 region reported in @xcite",
    ", we include a cxb systematic error of 12% in subsequent analysis .",
    "it was combined in quadrature with a statistical uncertainty , which was calculated by scanning over the parameter space with the @xmath32 command @xmath33 , to constitute the total measurement errors in the spectral fittings .",
    "in order to search the x - ray data for possible absorption features associated with the atomic gas cloud , we calculated a 2-d absorption map of the m86 central region based on a centroidal voronoi tessellation ( cvt hereafter ; @xcite ) binning method .",
    "the @xmath34 region shown in figure 1@xmath35 was thus divided into 71 sub - regions , each having a minimal signal - to - noise ratio of 100 , or a count of @xmath36 in @xmath37 kev .",
    "then we extracted the mos and pn spectra from individual cvt sub - regions and fit them simultaneously in @xmath37 kev with an absorbed apec model for the hot gas component , plus an absorbed power - law with index of 1.6 for unresolved point sources ( e.g. , x - ray binaries ; @xcite ) belonging to the galaxies .",
    "the redshift was fixed to 0 , while the absorption , temperature , and metal abundance were set free . adopting the redshift of n4388 (",
    "i.e. , 0.008 ) does not change the fitting results .",
    "the obtained absorption map is shown in figure 1@xmath38 .",
    "the associated errors are typically @xmath39 @xmath1 for low absorption sub - regions , and @xmath40 @xmath1 for the higher ones .",
    "we also attempted to apply the same spectroscopic method to the epic data within @xmath41 from the center of n4388 ; however , given the current data quality , we were not able to identify significant absorption structure beyond errors .",
    "other datasets in _ chandra _ and _ suzaku _ archives are not suited for this purpose .    as shown in figure 1@xmath38 ,",
    "the absorption @xmath26 are in most regions consistent within errors with the galactic value ( i.e. , @xmath42 @xmath1 ; ) throughout the field , but we found a possible excess region @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 southeast of the m86 center , as indicated by the red and purple circles . to verify this excess absorption structure ( eas hereafter ) , we investigated , in details , five representative regions on and surrounding the structure .",
    "the extracted pn spectra are shown in figure 2@xmath35 .",
    "one of them ( gray ) is inferred to have a slightly lower temperature , as suggested by its lower spectrum peak energy than in the others .",
    "the remaining four exhibit similar spectra in @xmath46 kev , but two of them ( red and purple ) show lower fluxes at @xmath47 kev than the other two , suggesting different absorption @xmath26 . to quantify these inferences ,",
    "the extracted spectra were fit with the same absorbed apec + power - law model as plotted in figure 2@xmath38 .",
    "the obtained confidence contours are plotted in figure 2@xmath48 and 2@xmath49 , on the absorption versus temperature , and absorption versus power - law normalization planes , respectively .",
    "it shows that the absorption on the eas ( red and purple circles ; @xmath50 @xmath1 ) is higher than those of the surrounding regions ( @xmath51 @xmath1 ) at the 90% confidence level , which can not be ascribed to uncertainties in the gas temperature or point source measurements .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there is no significant galactic dust cloud near the eas region , indicating that the excess absorption can not be created , either , by foreground absorption inhomogeneity .    to take into account the projected virgo icm component",
    ", we fit the spectra from the eas by adding a second absorbed apec model . according to previous measurement in @xcite ,",
    "the temperature of the virgo component was fixed at 2.3 kev .",
    "the two - phase model gave a better fit ( @xmath52 ) than the single - phase one ( @xmath53 ) to the northeast part of the eas ( purple circle in fig .",
    "it yielded a temperature of 0.8 @xmath54 0.1 kev for the m86 component , and a smaller overall absorbing @xmath26 of @xmath55 @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "2@xmath48 ) .",
    "according to the @xmath32 tool simftest , the fitting improvement with the two - phase model is significant at @xmath56 99% confidence level .",
    "although the two - phase model might partially explain the observed @xmath26 in the purple region , the excess absorption remains essentially unchanged in the red one . to further explore the origin of the eas in the red region",
    ", we allowed the absorptions of the two - phase components to vary freely .",
    "the best - fit @xmath26 are @xmath57 @xmath1 and @xmath58 @xmath1 for the m86 and virgo components , respectively .",
    "this implies that the measurement of the eas is driven by the m86 emission .",
    "such a two - phase model was also applied to the surrounding non - eas regions ( gray , black , and blue circles in fig .",
    "1 ) , and the resulting @xmath26 are consistent with , or smaller than , the single - phase ones .",
    "then we compared the detected eas with the  tail reported in og05 .",
    "as shown in figure 1@xmath38 , the southwest part of the eas nicely coincides with the peak of the  emission .",
    "the excess x - ray absorption @xmath26 above the galactic value , @xmath0 @xmath1 , is consistent with that estimated from the radio data ( @xmath59 @xmath1 ; og05 ) .",
    "also , based on the two - phase results of the red and purple circles , the mass of the absorber is estimated to be @xmath60 , which agrees with the  mass ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "these indicate that the southwest eas is probably induced by the  tail . on the other hand ,",
    "the northeast part of the eas ( purple circle ) , which exhibits an excess absorption of @xmath62 @xmath1 ( according to the two - phase fit ) , appears in a more complicated region . besides the northeast tip of the  tail , a plume of ionized gas , which has been found extending nee towards another galaxy ngc 4438 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , also appears to overlap with this feature .",
    "hence , the northeast part of the eas might be caused by a superposition of different absorbers .      to investigate thermal structure of the hot gas in the  tail ,",
    "we have also created a @xmath63 kev surface brightness map and a temperature map , shown in figure 3@xmath35 and 3@xmath38 , respectively , both covering the m86 center and n4388 regions .",
    "the maps were calculated by the same cvt binning and spectral fitting methods as described in  3.1 .",
    "figure 3@xmath35 reveals an x - ray emission enhancement ( marked with a green box ) , by a factor of @xmath64 higher than the surrounding , extending from n4388 up to @xmath2 south of m86 .",
    "it is associated apparently with the  tail . as shown in figure 3@xmath38 , the enhancement , or a tail ,",
    "has a lower temperature , @xmath65 = 1.07@xmath54 0.08 kev , than the surrounding region ( @xmath66 kev ) at the 99% confidence level .    to remove the projection effects",
    ", we carried out a two - phase spectral fitting to the low - temperature region shown in figure 3@xmath38 .",
    "since the projected emission is likely to be a blend of both virgo and m86 components , the temperature of the second apec component was set free .",
    "this model did not give a significant improvement to the fitting ( @xmath67 compared to the single - phase @xmath68 ) , and the parameters of the two apec components can not be well constrained .",
    "this may be caused by a relatively poor data quality .",
    "we thus fixed the temperature of one component to the averaged surrounding value of 1.31 kev ; then , the other temperature was obtained as 0.89@xmath54 0.10 kev .",
    "the 1.31 kev component has a surface brightness of @xmath69 ergs @xmath1 @xmath70 @xmath71 in @xmath72 kev , consistent with the surrounding value .",
    "hence , the 0.89 kev component is naturally considered as local emission possibly associated with the tail .",
    "assuming a cylinder shape ( 45 kpc in length and 10 kpc in radius ) of the extracted region shown in figure 3@xmath38 , the density of the 0.89 kev component was calculated to be @xmath73@xmath74 @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the volume filling factor , and its total mass in the extracted region is @xmath77@xmath4@xmath78 @xmath5 .",
    "the temperature and density of the x - ray tail are consistent with those reported in .",
    "based on a 2-d spectral analysis using the _ xmm - newton _ data , we detected a region with excess absorption ( @xmath79@xmath26 = @xmath0 @xmath1 ) at a distance of @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 southeast of the m86 center .",
    "the southwest peak of the absorption structure apparently coincides with the peak of an  gas tail which was probably removed from n4388 by ram pressure . towards southwest of the  peak ,",
    "the excess x - ray absorption diminished , but we instead observed , along the  tail , an excess x - ray surface brightness ( by a factor of 3 ) and a temperature decrease ( from @xmath80 kev to @xmath81 kev ) , which reconfirm the findings of .",
    "if this is attributed to emission from a hot plasma , we find a mass of @xmath3@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the detection of the eas allows us to constrain , more tightly than before , the stripping location of the long  tail .",
    "our results indicate that the eas region of the  tail is now in front of , or at similar distance to , the center of the m86 group .",
    "in contrast , the heliocentric recession velocity of the eas ( @xmath82 km @xmath70 ; og05 ) is much larger than that of m86 ( -244 km @xmath70 ) .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that these two objects are moving towards each other at @xmath83 km @xmath70 along the line - of - sight .",
    "furthermore , given an age of @xmath84 myr ( og05 ) , the eas region of the tail should have been created at least @xmath85 kpc in front of m86 .",
    "this further allows us to consider the origin of the rps .",
    "let us first examine a possible interaction between n4388 and the m86 group icm , assuming that the m86 is much outside the virgo icm sphere . by extrapolating the radially - averaged emission measure profile shown in figure 9 of @xcite ,",
    "the hot gas density of m86 at @xmath86 kpc is @xmath87 @xmath75 , and the ram pressure acted on n4388 is @xmath88 dyn @xmath30 .",
    "next we consider a n4388-virgo interaction . by adopting the gas density profile reported in figure 6 of @xcite and a predicted orbit of n4388 suggested in",
    ", the virgo icm near the stripping spot ( @xmath89 kpc ) has a density of @xmath90 @xmath75 , and the ram pressure is @xmath91 dyn @xmath30 .",
    "although the radial velocity difference between m86 and n4388 is larger than the virgo - n4388 one , the low icm density of the m86 significantly reduces the estimated ram pressure in the former case .",
    "a third picture is that n4388 has been interacting with a combination of the m86 and the virgo icm , assuming that the m86 group is well in the virgo cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "then the ram pressure is enhanced to @xmath92 dyn @xmath30 , which is contributed mostly from the virgo icm . to create stripping",
    ", the ram pressure should exceed the gravitational restoring force in the galaxy which was estimated to be @xmath93 dyn @xmath30 in @xcite .",
    "hence , our current result suggests that the n4388-m86 interaction is insufficient for the rps , and the  tail was created mostly by colliding with the virgo icm .",
    "another interesting aspect is to understand phase changes of the materials removed from n4388 . given the associated hot plasma mass and  mass of @xmath94@xmath4@xmath78 @xmath5 (  3.2 ) and @xmath95 @xmath5 ( og05 ) , respectively , the ionized - to - atomic gas mass ratio in the tail is therefore @xmath96 , which is an order of magnitude higher than the typical values within disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it implies that the 0.89  kev plasma is not the ism that was already in n4388 before the stripping , but rather a remnant of the cold gas , which has been transfered into the hot phase by thermal conduction or mixing with the ambient icm .",
    "let us examine the efficiency of the conductive heating .",
    "we may assume a minimal width of 5 kpc of the  tail ( fig . 1 of og05 ) and a @xmath26 of @xmath97 @xmath1 (  3.1 ) .",
    "then , employing a spitzer rate conductivity , the evaporation timescale can be calculated to be @xmath98 myr , which is a factor of 3 shorter than the age of the tail .",
    "hence , the thermal conduction should have been suppressed to some extent .",
    "this can naturally be explained by some magnetic interfaces between the cold and hot phases .",
    "a similar scenario was proposed to explain the multi - phase hot plasmas in the cluster cd galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when the conductive heat to a magnetic - field structure is substantially blocked , its  content might be condensed into star - forming materials .",
    "we will report this phenomenon in a follow - up paper .",
    "we thank tom oosterloo and jacqueline van gorkom for providing us the  map ."
