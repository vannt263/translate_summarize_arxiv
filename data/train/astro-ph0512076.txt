    "various proposals have been put forward to explain recent observations indicating that the universe is accelerating .",
    "a possible explanation is that the universe is filled with dark energy in the form of an exotic component , the generalized chaplygin gas , with negative equation of state @xcite .",
    "the striking feature of this model is that it allows for an unification of dark energy and dark matter @xcite .    another possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe could be the infrared modification of gravity one should expect from extra dimensional physics , which would lead to a modification of the effective friedmann equation at late times .",
    "a concrete model has been suggested by dvali , gabadadze and porrati @xcite and later generalized by dvali and turner @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the modification of the friedmann equation by the introduction of an additional nonlinear term proportional to @xmath0 , the so - called cardassian model @xcite .",
    "currently type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations provide the most direct way to probe the dark energy component at low to medium redshifts .",
    "recently , supernovae data has been analysed by various groups and it was shown that it yields relevant constraints on some cosmological parameters .",
    "in particular , it is possible to conclude that , when one considers the full supernova data set , the decelerating model is ruled out with a significant confidence level @xcite . it is also shown that one can measure the current value of the dark energy equation of state with higher accuracy and the data prefers the phantom kind of equation of state , @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the most significant result of that analysis is that , without a flat prior , supernovae data does not favour a flat @xmath2cdm model at least up to @xmath3 confidence level , which is consistent with other cosmological observations . in what concerns the equation of state of the dark energy component",
    ", it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the same set of supernovae data , that the best fit equation of state of dark energy evolves rapidly from @xmath4 in the past to @xmath5 at present , which suggests that a time varying dark energy fits the data better than the @xmath2cdm model .    in this paper",
