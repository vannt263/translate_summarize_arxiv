    "two - body charmless hadronic decays of neutral @xmath15 hadrons can provide insight into both the ckm matrix and possible new physics phenomena .",
    "the cdf  ii experiment@xcite can reconstruct significant samples of these decay modes by virtue of the high yields of @xmath15-quark production at the fermilab tevatron @xmath8 collider and the use of a dedicated trigger on impact parameters of charged - particle tracks .    whereas @xmath16 decays are also under intense scrutiny at the @xmath17 factories , studies of the @xmath9-meson and @xmath15-baryon channels are presently unique to the tevatron .",
    "properties of the heavier hadron states complement and extend measurements in the @xmath18 and @xmath16-meson sectors , _",
    "e.g. _ , by constraining hadronic parameters that are difficult to calculate@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i report new results on analyses of two - body charmless hadronic decays of @xmath16 , @xmath9 , and @xmath19 hadrons , charge - conjugate modes are implied throughout . ] in a sample with time - integrated luminosity @xmath5  pb@xmath6 collected by the cdf  ii detector between february 2002 and september 2003 at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath20  tev .",
    "data are collected using cdf s hadronic @xmath21 triggers , which are designed to select events containing track pairs originating from a common displaced vertex . at the lowest trigger levels , pairs of oppositely",
    "charged tracks are required to have each transverse momenta @xmath22  gev/@xmath23 and total @xmath24  gev/@xmath23 , impact parameters @xmath25150  @xmath26 m , and an azimuthal opening angle between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "candidate @xmath15 hadrons are then reconstructed from the track pairs and required to have a transverse decay length greater than 300  @xmath26 m , their total momenta point back to within 80  @xmath26 m of the primary vertex , and an invariant mass between 4.0 and 6.0  gev/@xmath29 .",
    "60 mm    additional optimized cuts are applied offline to confirm the trigger selection .",
    "an isolation criterion , defined as @xmath30 , where the sum is over all the non-@xmath15 tracks @xmath31 within a cone of radius=1 in pseudorapidity - azimuth space around the candidate @xmath15-hadron direction , is imposed to effect a @xmath32 background rejection factor while retaining a signal efficiency of @xmath3385% .",
    "specific ionization ( @xmath34 ) information measured in cdf s drift chamber is used statistically in the fit to distinguish @xmath35 from @xmath36 mesons with a separation of @xmath37 and @xmath38 for negative and positive tracks , respectively .",
    "this resolution suffices to provide a separation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 mesons that is @xmath3360% of what a perfect particle identification scheme would achieve .",
    "the di - track invariant mass distribution , where the world - average @xmath36-meson mass@xcite is assigned to each daughter regardless of @xmath34 information , is depicted by the points in fig .",
    "[ thefigure ] . a clear signal of @xmath39 events is observed .",
    "an unbinned maximum likelihood fit that combines ` dipion ' mass @xmath40 , additional kinematic ( kin ) , and @xmath34 particle identification ( pid ) information is used to discriminate between the two @xmath16 modes , the two @xmath9 modes , and the background component .",
    "the likelihood function used is @xmath41 , where the index @xmath42 runs over the @xmath43 events and @xmath44 has contributions from signal ( sig ) and background ( bkg ) : @xmath45 , where @xmath15 is the background fraction .",
    "the signal likelihood function is given by @xmath46 , where the index @xmath47 runs over the six distinct @xmath48 decay - mode and charge - state combinations , and the parameters @xmath49 represent their relative fractions determined by the fit .",
    "the background likelihood function is expressed as @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to @xmath40 , the other kinematic variable used is the charge - signed momentum imbalance , defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52(@xmath53 ) is the modulus of the smaller(larger ) momentum of the two tracks and @xmath54 is the charge sign of the track assigned to @xmath52 .",
    "analytic expressions for the @xmath40 dependence on @xmath55 exhibit discriminating shape differences between particles and antiparticles ; self tagging is thereby facilitated in the fit .",
    "the branching - fraction ratio of the @xmath16 modes is measured to be @xmath56 which is in agreement with the current world average@xcite .      in the @xmath9 sector ,",
    "two ratios of fragmentation fractions ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) and branching fractions are measured : @xmath60 @xmath61 where in both cases the following assumptions are made : @xmath62 , the @xmath2 content of @xmath63 is 100% dominated by the @xmath2-even short - lived component , and@xcite @xmath64 .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 is assumed because this @xmath2 @xmath9 eigenstate may not possess a lifetime identical to the average @xmath9 lifetime measured using other modes , including semileptonic decays . the uncertainty on @xmath65 is included in the systematics in eqs .",
    "[ eqn : bs1 ] and [ eqn : bs2 ] . combining eqs .",
    "[ eqn : bs1 ] and [ eqn : bs2 ] with world - average results@xcite for the light @xmath21 mesons provides a first measure of the branching fraction @xmath66 \\times 10^{-6},\\ ] ] which is almost twice that for the @xmath67 mode@xcite .",
    "the branching - fraction comparison between these two modes , which differ only by flavor of spectator quark , is compatible with expectations from qcd sum - rule calculations@xcite .",
    "the other @xmath9 channel for which an accessible branching fraction is expected , @xmath68 , is not observed and a limit is therefore set : @xmath69 which translates@xcite to @xmath70 , near the lower end of current expectations@xcite .",
    "other rare modes , thought to be dominated by annihilation and exchange processes and exhibiting branching fractions in an expected range@xcite of @xmath71 to @xmath72 , were sought by adding contribution components for them to the likelihood expression .",
    "since the fit parameters changed negligibly after their inclusion , no evidence for these modes was established , and the following limits were set : @xmath73 or@xcite @xmath74 .",
    "the current best limit measurement@xcite for this mode is @xmath75 .",
    "also , @xmath76 which takes the assumption that both modes have the same average lifetime and translates to @xmath77 .",
    "this represents a significant improvement over the previous best limit measurement@xcite of @xmath78 .",
    "our data sample was also used separately to search for the charmless two - body baryon decays@xcite @xmath79 and @xmath80 by counting the number of candidates populating a search region with invariant mass between@xcite 5.415 and 5.535  gev/@xmath29 .",
    "no evidence for these modes was found , and an upper limit is therefore presented : @xmath81     < 22 \\times 10^{-6 } \\ ; ( 90\\%\\ ; cl),\\ ] ] which improves upon the previous limit@xcite of @xmath82 .",
