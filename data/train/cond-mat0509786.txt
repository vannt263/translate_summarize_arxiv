    "symmetry is one of the most important ideas in modern physics . frequently , the identification of the symmetries of a physical system is the key to understanding it . in this paper",
    "we identify a new type of symmetries of nonrelativistic physics , which are manifest when the system is put in curved space , yet less evident in flat space .",
    "the uncovering of these symmetries comes from our attempt to understand the properties of the so - called `` unitary '' fermi gas , which is a gas of fermions which interact with each other through a zero - range two - body potential tuned to infinite scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "this system has been studied theoretically for some time  @xcite , but only recently did it become realized in experiments with trapped atoms using a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "what is special about this system the absence of any intrinsic parameter , except for the number density .",
    "unfortunately , this same feature means that there is no small coupling constant on which to build a reliable perturbation theory .",
    "it is therefore imperative that we find and exploit all the symmetries of this system .    despite the strong coupling , we are now certain that the ground state of the unitary fermi gas is a superfluid .",
    "we also have , as our starting point , at least two theoretical frameworks which allow one to solve certain problems involving the unitary fermi gas in a reliable fashion .",
    "these are the thomas - fermi theory and superfluid hydrodynamics .",
    "the two theories are very similar : both make no attempt to solve the problem at the microscopic level ; they are both valid in the long - wavelength regime , when the characteristic length scale of the problem is much larger than all microscopic scales ( including the healing length ) ; and they need as an input at most one parameter ( which is denoted as @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ xi - def ] ) and characterizes the zero - temperature equation of state . ) the total energy and the oscillation frequencies of unitary fermi gas in a trap  @xcite can be computed using these approaches .",
    "the input parameter @xmath1 is not fixed within these theories , but can either be measured experimentally or computed by monte - carlo simulations .    however , until now it is not possible to systematically include corrections to either the thomas - fermi theory or superfluid hydrodynamics . at weak coupling",
    "there is no fundamental obstacle to compute these corrections , but our tools do not work at strong coupling .",
    "these corrections can be considerable if we want to study the physics at length scales not much larger than the healing length .",
    "the main , utilitarian motivation of this paper is to develop a systematic way to go beyond the leading order in the long - wavelength expansion .",
    "this is done using an effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite .",
    "the central idea of the eft philosophy is a power expansion over momentum ( or inverse wavelength ) , instead of the usual perturbative expansion over powers of the coupling constant .",
    "this makes eft particularly suitable for problems involving strongly coupled systems in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "naturally we find that at leading order the eft reproduces the thomas - fermi theory and superfluid hydrodynamics .",
    "however , in principle , the eft can be extended to arbitrary order in the expansion over momentum at the cost of introducing an increasing number of free parameters .",
    "the form of the effective lagrangian is constrained only by the symmetries of the system under study .    somewhat unexpectedly , putting all possible constraints on the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) lagrangian turns out to be a very nontrivial problem in the case of the unitary fermi gas . in this paper , this task is accomplished by temporarily putting the system in curved space and exploiting the properties of general coordinate invariance and conformal invariance . working in curved space necessitates the use of certain mathematical tools normally employed only in general relativity , but what we find at the end is quite nontrivial and worth the effort .",
    "in addition to one free parameter at the leading order , one needs just two parameters to characterize the nlo lagrangian .",
    "these parameters can not be computed within the eft , but since the number of physical quantities that can be computed is greater than three , the eft has real predictive power .",
    "we start the paper with a summary of some results that can be obtained using the eft ( sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] ) . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : nrgci ] we show that the lagrangian for interacting nonrelativistic particles can be coupled to background gauge fields and spatial metric in a way that respects gauge invariance and the general coordinate invariance .",
    "the general coordinate invariance is a gauge version of the translation and galilean transformations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conformal ] we study the conformal invariance of unitary fermi gas .",
    "we then proceed , in sec .",
    "[ sec : leff ] and [ sec : nlo ] , to find the most general effective lagrangian , to leading and next - to - leading orders , that is consistent with these symmetries .",
    "some applications of the eft are considered in sec .",

    "we conclude with sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "here we give a brief summary of the result of this paper for the unitary fermi gas .",
    "we do it here to give the reader a sense of the power and the limitations of the effective field theory derived in the paper .",
    "we work in the unit system where @xmath2 .",
    "we denote the number density as @xmath3 and the fermion mass as @xmath4 , from which we define the fermi momentum @xmath5 , the fermi energy @xmath6 , and the fermi velocity @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 , defined as the ratio of the energy density of the unitary fermi gas to the energy density of a free fermi gas at the same density , @xmath8    first we shall show that the dynamics of the gas is described , to leading order , by the lagrangian , @xmath9^{5/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the phase of the condensate , @xmath11 is the chemical potential , @xmath12 is the trapping potential , and @xmath13 is a dimensionless parameter .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "another case , not considered in this paper , is that of rotating systems where @xmath38 are not zero .",
    "although space is flat in all practical applications , keeping @xmath32 arbitrary in intermediate steps allow one to derive nontrivial results , as we shall see .",
    "we have written the time - derivative term in eq .",

    ", however , the two forms are not equivalent .",
    "as at the end we shall put the metric to flat , the choice between the two forms is a matter of convenience .",
    "we will soon find that the symmetric form in  ( [",
    "free - l ] ) is much more advantageous .    the action  ( [",
    "free - l ] ) is invariant under gauge transformations , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "it is also invariant under a change of coordinate on the 3d manifold , @xmath47 the infinitesimal version of ( [ gauge - tr ] ) and ( [ 3d - gci ] ) is @xmath48 we note that while the gauge parameter @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ static - gci ] ) can be a function of both time and space , so far we have considered the gauge parameter @xmath50 ( which is the coordinate shift , @xmath51 ) to be time - independent .",
    "in fact , if one attempts to make @xmath50 time - dependent , one finds that the action is not invariant , but acquires a change proportional to the time derivative of @xmath50 , @xmath52 however , the invariance of the action can be restored by a small modification of the transformation laws  ( [ static - gci ] ) .",
    "the modified transformations read    [ nonrel - gci ] @xmath53    it is straightforward to verify that terms proportional to @xmath54 now cancel in @xmath55 .",
    "( had we written the time - derivative term in the asymmetric form @xmath44 this would not be true . )",
    "we shall call ( [ nonrel - gci ] ) the _ nonrelativistic general coordinate transformations _ , or simply general coordinate transformations .",
    "the action is said to be general coordinate invariant .",
    "let us discuss the relationship between the transformations  ( [ nonrel - gci ] ) with the more familiar galilean transformations .",
    "in contrast to  ( [ nonrel - gci ] ) , the galilean transformations are defined in flat space , @xmath42 .",
    "they can be thought of as a special class of  ( [ nonrel - gci ] ) with a particular choice of @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath56 this leaves the flat metric unchanged while transforming other fields , @xmath57 note that in eqs .",
    "( [ galilean ] ) terms proportional to @xmath58 and higher orders of @xmath59 have been dropped .",
    "thus any theory with general coordinate symmetry is automatically galilean invariant when restricted to flat space.the transformations  ( [ nonrel - gci ] ) can be thought of as a gauge version of the translation and galilean transformations .",

    "for example , the theory with the following lagrangian , @xmath60 is consistent with general coordinate invariance , as one can make @xmath61 transform as @xmath62 in flat space ( [ int - l ] ) describes a system of particles interacting though a yukawa two - body potential , @xmath63 we thus have an example of an interacting theory where coupling to an external gauge field and a metric can be introduced in a way consistent with general coordinate invariance .",
    "we have not demonstrated that general coordinate invariance can be achieved for _ any _ two - body potential . however , our foremost interest is in systems with universal behavior , where only the scattering length @xmath64 is important , not the details of the two - body potential .",
    "for this purpose , the lagrangian  ( [ int - l ] ) is sufficient . in particular ,",
    "infinite scattering length is achieved by fine - tuning @xmath65 and @xmath66 so that @xmath67 when the first bound state appears at threshold . to achieve universality we also need to keep @xmath66 smaller than any physical length scale .",
    "the universality of the fermionic system with infinite scattering length means that one can choose @xmath65 and @xmath66 arbitrarily ( keeping @xmath66 small ) , and the physics does not depends on our choice if eq .",
