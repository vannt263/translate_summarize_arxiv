    "it has been known for quite some time now that intermediate mass stars in the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase of their evolution contribute at least 50% of the nir light in a simple stellar population ( ssp ) of age 1 - 2 gyr , e.g. , @xcite , bruzual ( 2007 , 2011 ) .",
    "the treatment of this stellar phase in stellar population synthesis models determines the predicted spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of stellar populations in this wavelength and age range . in fig.[fig1 ] we compare the predictions of @xcite for a salpeter imf , @xmath1 , ssp model at two different ages , with the predictions of three different versions of our code : ( a ) the bc03 models ; ( b ) the minor revision of these models introduced by cb07 , and ( c ) a major revision of this code and models ( in preparation , hereafter cb@xmath2 ) .",
