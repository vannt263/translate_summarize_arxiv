    "the non - detection of pulsed emission in the xmm - newton data suggests that it could be a neutron star only if the pulsed fraction is lower than 4% or the period is shorter than 146 ms .",
    "the lightcurve , especially at times after the peak around mjd 56970 , seems to follow a simple exponential decay on a timescale of a month or so , which is often seen in low - mass x - ray binaries as the first phase of flux decay during an outburst @xcite .",

    "the presence of a spectral break at a few kev has been ubiquitously found in bright ulxs and argued as a signature of super - eddington accretion @xcite .",
    "specifically , depending on the mcd plus power - law fitting , this source is typical of a sub - class of ulxs , dubbed as the _ broadened disk _ class by @xcite , which have a relatively low luminosity ( near the luminosity threshold for ulxs ) and were interpreted as due to normal stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath95  @xmath4 ) accreting near the eddington level .",
    "we argue that the mcd plus power - law fit is not physical because the power - law component , which is presumably produced by up - scattering of disk photons in an optically - thin corona , dominates over the mcd component at low energies ( below 1.5 kev ) .",

    "the absence of timing noise is also consistent with the spectrum being dominated by emission from a thermal slim - disk .",

    "also , most ulxs were found to have a displacement with star clusters @xcite , suggesting a lower probability of finding a ulx associated with a star cluster .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the x - ray flare is due to accretion onto a nuclear black hole of the galaxy , by a tidally disrupted star or other source of gas . in the scenario of a tde , part of the disrupted stellar materials",

    "the source displayed an overall decreasing trend in flux ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "however , the short baseline of the monitoring program does not allow for a test for the @xmath103 power - law decay model , as short - term variability is always associated with accretion system .",

    "the x - ray energy spectrum is hard , unlike canonical tde candidates .",
    "this could be possible if we had detected it in a late phase .",
    "due to the absence of sensitive observations between 2011 february and 2014 july , we may have caught it 13 years after the initial burst . in this case , the current accretion rate is rather low , the disk is no longer a standard disk , and the emergent spectrum may have become hard . in fact , the tde candidate igr j12580 + 0134 associated with ngc 4845 showed a hard spectrum at its luminosity peak @xcite .",
    "also , the jetted tde candidates manifested themselves as an extreme subclass with complex spectral and temporal behaviors @xcite .",
    "these indicate that tdes may be a diverse population .",
    "the upper limit obtained from the _ maxi _ data indicates that the black hole mass assuming an eddington limited tde is less than @xmath9@xmath104 @xmath4 , if it had emitted a hard spectrum ( @xmath105 ) from the very beginning . if the initial x - ray spectrum is much softer and peaked at energies below 2 kev , then the upper limit in luminosity is much higher , e.g. , @xmath106 erg  s@xmath1  given a cool disk emission with @xmath107 kev , and so is the allowed black hole mass ( up to @xmath9@xmath108 @xmath4 )",

    "specifically , the x - ray emission from the molecular cloud sgr  b2 requires x - ray flaring activities from sgr  a@xmath111 which have a power - law spectrum with a photon index @xmath112 and an x - ray luminosity of roughly @xmath98 erg  s@xmath1  lasting a few years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spectrum and luminosity are similar to those observed for ngc 247 .",
    "in addition to the possibility of being triggered by a tidally disrupted star , the accretion materials could come from a stream of gas similar to the case of the g2 cloud near sgr  a@xmath111 @xcite , in which case the accretion rate may be insufficient to reach the eddington limit .",
    "thus , the temporal and spectral characteristics of this object can be well explained by a stellar - mass black hole accreting close to the eddington limit at its luminosity peak .",
    "however , we emphasize that the possibility for nuclear black hole activity can not be completely ruled out .",
    "the absence of sensitive x - ray observations in the early phase of the flare hampers a conclusive diagnosis of the source nature .",
    "also , the tde behavior may be too complex to predict especially in its late phase .",
    "plus , the trigger could be other sources like a small gas cloud rather than a disrupted star , whose consequent accretion behavior is even more difficult to predict .",
    "a continued x - ray monitoring will be a key to distinguishing the different scenarios .",
    "if this object is proven to be a nuclear black hole , it will have great interest in two aspects .",
    "first , its proximity will offer us a unique test laboratory for tde physics at the late phase , if it is a tde .",
    "also , it suggests that monitoring in x - rays for flaring activity may be an effective tool for us to unveil hidden nuclear black holes in nearby quiescent galaxies .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments that improved the paper , the _ chandra _ director for granting discretionary time and the _ swift _ pi for approving the too program , and the _ xmm - newton_/_chandra_/_swift _ teams for successful executions of the observations .",

    "<S> ngc 247 is a nearby late - type bulgeless spiral galaxy that contains an inactive nucleus . we report a serendipitous discovery of an x - ray flare from the galaxy center with a luminosity up to @xmath0 erg  s@xmath1  in the 0.310 kev band with _ xmm - newton_. a _ chandra _ observation confirms that the new x - ray source is spatially coincident with the galaxy nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the _ xmm - newton _ data revealed a hard power - law spectrum with a spectral break near 34 kev , no pulsations on timescales longer than 150 ms , and a flat power spectrum consistent with poisson noise from 1 mhz to nearly 10 hz . </S>",
    "<S> follow - up observations with _ swift _ detected a second flux peak followed by a luminosity drop by factor of almost 20 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral and temporal behaviors of the nuclear source are well consistent with the scenario that the flare was due to an outburst of a low - mass x - ray binary that contains a stellar - mass black hole emitting near its eddington limit at the peak . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can not be ruled out that the sudden brightening in the nucleus was due to accretion onto a possible low - mass nuclear black hole , fed by a tidally disrupted star or a gas cloud ; the _ maxi _ observations limit the peak luminosity of the flare to less than @xmath2  erg  s@xmath1 , suggesting that it is either a low mass black hole or an inefficient tidal disruption event ( tde ) . </S>"
