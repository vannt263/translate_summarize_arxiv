    "in nuclear , molecular and high energy physics [ 1,2 ] , one of the interesting problems is to obtain exact solutions of the relativistic wave equations like klein - gordon ( kg ) , dirac and salpeter wave equations for mixed vector and scalar potential .",
    "the kg equation has also been used to understand the motion of a spin - zero particle in large class of potentials using different methods .",
    "this allows us to introduce two types of potential coupling , which are the four - vector potential ( @xmath5 ) and the space - time scalar potential ( @xmath6 ) .    for the case",
    "@xmath7 the solution of these wave equations with physical potentials has been studied recently .",
    "furthermore , their exact solutions are possible only for certain central potentials such as morse potential [ 3 ] , hulthn potential [ 4 ] , woods - saxon potential [ 5 ] , pschl - teller potential [ 6 ] , reflectionless - type potential [ 7 ] , pseudoharmonic oscillator [ 8 ] , ring - shaped harmonic oscillator [ 9 ] , @xmath8 potential [ 10 ] , five - parameter exponential potential [ 11 ] , rosen - morse potential [ 12 ] , and generalized symmetrical double - well potential [ 13 ] , etc by using different methods .",
    "it is remarkable that in most of these works , the scalar and vector potentials are almost taken to be equal ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) [ 2,14 ] .",
    "recently , interest in the solutions of the kg equation for the case where @xmath10 has surged .",
    "it presents bounded solutions in the relativistic view , although the kg equation reduces to the schrdinger - like problem in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "however , the reduced equation can show the relativistic properties of the system .",
    "for the most recent contributions , one may consult the papers in [ 2,6,9,10 ] and references therein .",
    "therefore , the choice @xmath11 ( positive energy states ) produces a nontrivial nonrelativistic limit with a potential function @xmath12 and not @xmath13 it represents the concept of the exact spin symmetry that occurs in nuclei ( _ i.e. _ , when the difference potential @xmath14 in the negative energy states ( corresponding to @xmath15 ) the nonrelativistic limit is the trivial interaction free - mode .",
    "it represents the concept of the pseudospin symmetry ( _ i.e. _ , occurs when the sum potential @xmath16 [ 15 ] .",
    "the spin symmetry is relevant for mesons [ 16 ] .",
    "the pseudospin symmetry concept has been applied to many systems in nuclear physics and related areas [ 15 - 17 ] and used to explain features of deformed nuclei [ 18 ] , the super - deformation [ 19 ] and to establish an effective nuclear shell - model scheme [ 17,20 ] .",
    "this , of course , does not diminish the importance of such problems .",
    "it only limits it s contribution ( with the proper physical interpretation ) to the relativistic regime [ 14 ] .",
    "however , in some few other cases , it is considered the case where the scalar potential is greater than the vector potential ( in order to guarantee the existence of kg bound states ) ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) [ 21 - 24 ] .",
    "many authors have considered a more general transformation between the unequal vector and scalar potentials given by @xmath18 ( or @xmath19)@xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 being arbitrary constants of certain proportions have to be chosen after solving the problem under consideration ( cf .",
    "[ 25 ] and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , such physical potentials are very few .",
    "the bound state solutions for the last case is being obtained for the exponential potential with the @xmath4-wave ( @xmath23 ) kg equation when the scalar potential is greater than the vector potential [ 21 ] .",
    "the problems connected with the molecular structure provide interesting and instructive applications of quantum mechanics , since molecules are considerably more complex in structure than atoms .",
    "two distinct problems arise in connection with molecular structure .",
    "the first is to obtain the electronic wave functions and potential energy functions of the nuclear coordinates .",
    "this problem can be solved analytically only in the simplest cases .",
    "the second is to obtain the solution of the nuclear motion equation . in this regard ,",
    "the construction of a suitable potential function of a diatomic molecule is very important .",
    "it has been found that the potential - energy function for the lowest electronic states of actual diatomic molecules can be expressed by means of the morse potential [ 26]:@xmath24 \\right ] ^{2},\\]]which has three adjustable positive parameters @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 at @xmath28 it has a minimum value at zero and approaches @xmath26 exponentially for large @xmath29 if @xmath30 is somewhat smaller than @xmath31 it becomes large ( but not infinie ) as @xmath32 this potential is important in the field of molecular physics describing the interaction between two atoms [ 26,27 ] .",
    "overmore , progress has been made in the field of diatomic molecules and extensive use of the potential functions have been introduced [ 28,29 ] . at present",
    "the morse potential is still one of the potential functions used most in molecular physics and quantum chemistry [ 30 ] .",
    "however , it has few asymptotic inaccuracies in the regions of small and large @xmath29 to avoid these inaccuracies , many works have been carried out in that direction to improve morse potential [ 31 ] . in 1986 , schiberg [ 32 ] suggested hyperbolical ( empirical ) potential functions of the form : @xmath33 ^{\\pm 1}\\right\\ } ^{2},\\]]where @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are three adjustable positive parameters with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the spectroscopic dissociation energy ) and @xmath39 @xmath40 is a parameter .",
    "in contrast to the everywhere - regular morse potential , @xmath41 is highly singular at the origin with @xmath42 and @xmath43 singularities .",
    "the two potentials behave similarly near the extremum point @xmath44 it has the minimum value @xmath45 at the point@xmath46and approaches @xmath26 exponentially for large @xmath29 unlike the morse potential ( 1 ) , the empirical potential ( ep ) function @xmath41 approaches infinity at the point @xmath47 in the region of large @xmath48 it is closer to the experimental rydberg - klein - rees ( rkr ) curve than the morse potential for some diatomic molecules . for a diatomic molecular model instead of the nuclear model , we consider the reduced mass definition . if the nuclei have masses @xmath49 and @xmath50 the reduced mass is defined as @xmath51 and at this point the diatomic molecular model can be included to the the pseudospin symmetry concept . in this context , it is worth noting that the energy of the nuclear motion ( in @xmath52 ) is widely separated from the energy in atomic vibration and rotation ( in @xmath53 ) .",
    "that is why , one is able to separate the two motions and study the atomic vibration and rotation separately from the nuclear motion .",
    "lu _ et al _ [ 33 ] obtained an approximate solution for the schrdinger equation of diatomic molecule oscillator with the positive sign ep functions given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ( @xmath54 case ) by means of the hypergeometric series method .",
    "further , rigorous energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the @xmath55 schrdinger eqauation are also obtained using a similar method@xmath56 since there are no exact analytical solutions for the ep functions @xmath57 without an approximation to the centrifugal term @xmath58 some approximation [ 34 ] was used to obtain these solutions .",
    "one of these approximations have been employed in solving the rotating morse potential for any @xmath59-state [ 34,35 ] .",
    "the ro - vibrating energy eigenvalues of the ep functions were determined with a semiclassical ( sc ) procedure ( the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition ) and a quantum - mechanical ( qm ) method ( the schrdinger equation ) [ 33 ] .",
    "furthermore , several approximation schemes have been developed to find better analytical formulas for eq .",
    "( 2 ) with @xmath54 [ 33,36 ] .",
    "overmore , jia _ et al _ [ 37 ] have used the basic concepts of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics formalism and the functional analysis method to investigate approximately the pseudospin symmetric solutions of the dirac equation for the arbitrary pseudo - orbital angular momentum number @xmath60 and to obtain the bound state solutions for the nuclei in the relativistic ep as a diatomic molecular model .",
    "very recently , the nu method [ 38 - 40 ] was applied to solve the radial schrdinger wave equation with the ep functions for @xmath61 case [ 41 ] .",
    "the analytic solution is used to obtain the ro - vibrating energy states for selected @xmath62 and @xmath63 diatomic molecules using the relevant potential parameters and spectroscpic constants given in ref . [ 32 ] .    over the past years",
    ", the quantum deformation [ 42 ] has been the subject of interest because of its relevance with applications in nuclei [ 43 - 45 ] , statistical quantum theory , string beam theory and conformal field theory [ 46 - 49 ] .",
    "recently , some authors have introduced few potentials in terms of hyperbolic functions [ 50,51 ] in the view of @xmath64-deformation [ 52 ] .",
    "encouraged with the high performance of the above inter - molecular potential , we write the ep functions as    @xmath65 ^{\\pm 1}=\\frac{e^{\\alpha ( r - r_{e})}\\pm e^{-\\alpha ( r - r_{e})}}{e^{\\alpha ( r - r_{e})}\\mp e^{-\\alpha ( r - r_{e})}}=\\frac{% 1\\pm e^{-2\\alpha ( r - r_{e})}}{1\\mp e^{-2\\alpha ( r - r_{e})}}=\\frac{1\\pm qe^{-2\\alpha r}}{1\\mp qe^{-2\\alpha r}}=\\left [ \\coth _ { q}(\\alpha r)\\right ] ^{\\pm 1},\\ ] ]    @xmath66 ^{\\pm 1}\\right\\ } ^{2}=d\\left\\ { 1-\\sigma \\left [ \\frac{1\\pm qe^{-2\\alpha r}}{1\\mp qe^{-2\\alpha r}}\\right ] \\right\\ } ^{2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 giving a magnitude for @xmath64 that is larger than one . for an inverse transformation @xmath68 the magnitude for @xmath64 varies between zero and one . in the context of the quantum deformation [ 52 ] ,",
    "the above form is similar to a @xmath64-deformed ( perturbed ) generalized deformed empirical potential ( @xmath64-dep / gdep ) functions .",
    "it is worth noting that the range of parameter @xmath64 was taken as @xmath69 in [ 50 ] and has been extended to @xmath70 or @xmath69  or even complex by ref .",
    "such @xmath64-deformed potential functions have been introduced for the first time by arai [ 42 ] for real @xmath64 values . when  @xmath64 is complex ,",
    "these functions are called the generalized deformed potential functions . in this paper",

    ", we calculate the ro - vibrating energy states for selected @xmath62 and @xmath63 diatomic molecules in the non - relativistic approach .",
    "section 6 contains the relevant conclusions .",
    "the nu method is briefly outlined here and the details can be found in [ 38 ] .",
    "this method was proposed to solve the second - order differential equation of the hypergeometric - type :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are at most second - degree polynomials and @xmath77 is a first - degree polynomial .",

    "it is defined with a compact support often called domain of influence which can be spheres in three - dimensions .",
    "generally speaking , the weight function commonly used is exponential function .",
    "furthermore , the weighted integral  and weighted average are defined by @xmath92 and @xmath93 if @xmath94 real - valued orthogonal polynomial functions , respectively , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath97 etc . since @xmath98 and @xmath99 the derivative of @xmath100 needs to be negative [ 38 ] which is the essential condition in making the choice of particular solution relevant to the real bound state solution . the other part of the wave functions in eq .

    "the determination of @xmath103 is the essential point in the calculation of @xmath104 for which the discriminant of the square root in the last equation is set to zero .",
    "this gives the polynomial @xmath105 which is dependent on the transformation function @xmath106 also , the parameter @xmath107 defined in eq .",
    "( 8) takes the form@xmath108 in this regard , we can construct a parameteric generalization of the nu method valid for any central and non - central exponential - type potentials .",

    "in relativistic quantum mechanics , we usually use the kg equation for describing a scalar particle , i.e. , the spin-@xmath45 particle dynamics .",
