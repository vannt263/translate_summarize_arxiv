    "the flux ratios of lensed images in some quadruply lensed qsos disagree with the prediction of best - fit lens models with a smooth potential whose fluctuation scale is larger than the separation between the lensed images . such a discrepancy is called the `` anomalous flux ratio '' and has been considered as an imprint of cold dark matter subhalos with a mass of @xmath7 in the lensing galaxy @xcite .",
    "subhalos can be also detected through their effects on the image positions @xcite .",

    "we also assumed an error of 0.2arcsec for the position of the centroid of x , which is roughly the angular size , and 0.003arcsec for the position of the centroid of g. a large error for x was adopted because of possible contamination from the lensed fifth image .",

    "the ratio of convergence of y at a1 and a2 becomes smaller than @xmath92 , and hence the convergence at a1 becomes too small to account for the reddening in optical / ir bands ( see subsection 3.3 ) .",

    "then we fit extinction curves to the flux ratios of a1@xmath112b and a2@xmath112b in different wavelengths to estimate the amount of differential extinction .",
    "we adopted the dust extinction curve for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) bar @xcite and assumed the mir flux ratios as the intrinsic ones . in order to examine the dust extinction from a dwarf galaxy either in the intervening line of sight or in the galaxy g",

    "the reduced @xmath115 for the fits of extinction curves were larger than unity if only the observational errors in the flux ratios are taken into account . to achieve unity for the reduced @xmath115",

    "we note that our estimates of the differential extinction from an intervening obscurer at @xmath122 approximately agree with those in a previous study @xcite in which the standard galactic extinction law of @xmath123 for @xmath124 at @xmath125 is assumed .",
    "the weighted average of the flux ratios of c@xmath112b is also overlaid in figure 4 .",
    "the estimated value @xmath126 is consistent with the c@xmath112b flux ratio in mid - infrared ( @xmath127 ) at @xmath128 sigmas , and agrees well with those in our g@xmath129x@xmath129y lens models ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) shown in table 1 .",
    "we can estimate the ratio of the difference of convergence contribution @xmath132 between a2 and b to a1 and b as @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the redshifts of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively ( figure 2 ) .",
    "they are close to or slightly larger than the ratios of the differential extinction of a2 to that of a1 , @xmath137 for both the redshifts .",
    "therefore , the large difference in the differential extinction of a2 relative to a1 can be naturally explained by our model in which object y has an elongated sie profile even though a1 is located close to a2 .",
    "the dust mass column density @xmath138 in a sight line per an amount of extinction is @xmath139 for the galaxy model and @xmath140 for the smc dust model @xcite . assuming that y resides at @xmath141 , the dust mass column density estimated from the amount of extinction in the site line of a1(a2 ) is @xmath142 for the galaxy dust model , and @xmath143 for the smc dust model .",
    "if the dust mass distribution traces the best - fit sie mass profile of y , then the estimated dust mass for the smallest elliptical region centered at the centroid of y that includes a1(a2 ) is @xmath144 for the galaxy dust model , and @xmath145 for the smc dust model .",
    "we find that the dust mass @xmath5 estimated from the differential extinction does not significantly change if @xmath42 and it agrees with the value obtained from the sub - mm continuum emission of y provided that the dust temperature is @xmath146 , the emissivity index is @xmath40 and the redshift is @xmath42 .    thus these results indicate that object y is a good candidate for an intervening object that causes the differential extinction of a1 and a2 .",
    "the detected object y is most probably a dusty dark dwarf galaxy at a redshift of @xmath147 .",
    "if y is associated with a subhalo at @xmath148 , then it may be also associated with @xmath149 21-cm absorption systems in the lensing galaxy g , which has a large line - of - sight velocity @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "the inferred @xmath149 column density of the sum of three systems around @xmath151 is @xmath152 @xcite , where @xmath153 is the spin temperature and @xmath154 is the covering factor for the background continuum source .",
    "if we assume @xmath155 and @xmath156 , then the @xmath149 column density estimated from absorption agrees with the value estimated from the difference in the hydrogen ( @xmath157 ) column densities in sight lines to a1 and a2 relative to b , @xmath158 , which was measured with the x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "the latter can be converted into the sum of hydrogen mass column densities @xmath159 in the sight lines to a1 and a2 as @xmath160 .",
    "then the sum of baryon mass column densities at the sight lines is estimated as @xmath161 assuming the solar abundance @xcite .",
    "this value is comparable to the corresponding surface mass density @xmath162 inferred from the best - fit sie profile for y. the hydrogen mass enclosing a1(a2 ) is then estimated as @xmath163 provided that the gas distribution traces the best - fit sie profile .",
    "this implies that the mass profile of the lens model is solely determined by baryon which dominates over the dark matter .",
    "such dark matter deficiency reminds us of missing dark matter in some dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the dust to gas ratio in the sight line to a1(a2 ) is @xmath164 if the hydrogen column density in the sight line to a1(a2 ) is proportional to the surface mass density of the best - fit sie with @xmath84 .",
    "the dust to gas mass ratio in the sight line to a1(a2 ) is also estimated as @xmath165 for the galaxy dust model .",
    "these values are smaller than the galactic values , but larger than those for lmc and smc @xcite .",
    "conversely , if we assume the dust mass from extinction and the dust - to - gas ratio for smc , the gas masses around a1 and a2 become much larger than those inferred from the best - fit sie mass profile assuming that baryon traces dark matter . therefore , we conclude that the dust to gas ratio and the dust properties of y are much similar to those in galaxy than to those in lmc or smc if y is associated with @xmath149 absorption systems at @xmath166 .",
    "if y is associated with another dwarf galaxy in the line of sight , the most probable redshift is @xmath167 at which the critical surface density is the smallest . since the critical surface density is a broad function of redshift , the reasonable range of redshift is also broad .",
    "for instance , for a redshift of @xmath168 , the difference in the critical surface density falls within 20 percent of the minimum value .",
    "this is consistent with our lensing constraint : @xmath169 .",
    "indeed , a recent theoretical analysis predicts that the expected convergence contribution from intervening structures is much larger than that from subhalos in mg0414 + 0534 @xcite .",
    "although object y seems to have a relatively large size @xmath170kpc for a galaxy with one - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath171km / s , the optical / nir emission seems to be extremely small as @xmath172jy at the i band error in the i band flux @xcite . ] .",
    "if y is at @xmath173 , the corresponding stellar mass would be @xmath174 if the sed is similar to that of faint submillimeter galaxies like less 34 @xcite .",
    "however , it is unnatural unless huge amount of dust is hiding luminous stellar components .",
    "perhaps , y is an object like recently discovered ultra diffuse galaxies ( udgs ) in coma @xcite .",
    "udgs have stellar masses typical of dwarf galaxies but effective radii of milky - way sized objects .",
    "the stellar components may have been expanded due to outflow caused by starburst @xcite or agn activity .",
    "then the surface brightness in the optical / nir band can be extremely small despite being gas - rich .",
    "the required high ellipticity @xmath175 for y is consistent with the shape of udgs if prolate @xcite and that of dark matter halos that host the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies if oblate @xcite",
    ". more detailed analysis of y would give us a clue about the origin of past starburst activity .",
    "if y is turned out to be residing in the intervening line of sight , then a substantial portion of faint submillimeter galaxies in the universe may be attributed to such gas - rich dusty dark dwarf galaxies .",
