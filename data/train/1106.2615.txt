    "simulations of qcd equation of state ( eos ) on lattice show that at very high temperatures and/or densities the nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to a new state of matter called quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) .",
    "it is expected that qgp can be produced experimentally by colliding two nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collider(rhic ) at bnl and large hadron collider(lhc ) at cern are two such experimental facilities .",
    "the depletion of hadrons with high transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) produced in nucleus + nucleus collisions with respect to those produced in proton + proton ( pp ) collisions has been considered as a signature of qgp formation .",
    "the two main processes which cause the depletion are ( i ) the elastic collisions and ( ii ) the radiative loss or the inelastic collisions of the high energy partons with the quarks , anti - quarks and gluons in the thermal bath . the importance of elastic energy loss in qgp diagnosis was pointed out first by bjorken  @xcite .",
    "later the calculations of elastic loss had been performed with improved techniques  @xcite and its importance was highlighted subsequently  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of charm and bottom quarks in the partonic plasma , in the expected range of temperature to be attained in the experiments , is small .",
    "consequently , the bulk properties of the plasma is not decided by them and hence heavy quarks may act as an efficient probe for the diagnosis of qgp .",
    "the collisional energy loss of heavy quarks  @xcite has gained importance recently in view of the measured nuclear suppression in the @xmath1 spectra of non - photonic single electrons  @xcite . in the present work we focus on the energy loss of heavy quarks in qgp in deducing the properties of the medium .",
    "several ingredients like inclusions of non - perturbative contributions from the quasi - hadronic bound state  @xcite , 3-body scattering effects  @xcite , the dissociation of heavy mesons due to its interaction with the partons in the thermal medium  @xcite and employment of running coupling constants and realistic debye mass  @xcite have been proposed to improve the description of the experimental data .",
    "for mass dependence of energy loss due to radiative processes dokshitzer and kharzeev  @xcite argue that radiative energy loss of heavy quarks will be suppressed compared to that of light quarks due to dead cone effects  @xcite",
    ". however , aurenche and zakharov claim that the radiative process has an anomalous mass dependence  @xcite due to the finite size of the qgp which leads to small difference in energy loss between a heavy and a light quarks .",
    "although the authors of  @xcite concluded that the suppression of radiative loss for heavy quarks is due to dead cone effects but it will be fair to state that the issue is not settled yet .",
    "the other mechanism that can affect the radiative loss is the lpm effect  @xcite which depends on the relative magnitude of two time scales of the system  @xcite : the formation time ( @xmath2 ) and the mean scattering time scale ( @xmath3 ) of the emitted gluons . if @xmath4 then lpm suppression will be effective .",
    "the lpm effect is built - in in the expression for radiative energy loss of heavy quarks derived in  @xcite . in the present work the lpm and the dead cone effects",
    "are explicitly taken into account for heavy quark dissipation .",
    "we assume here that the light quarks and gluons thermalize before heavy quarks .",
    "the charm and bottom quarks execute brownian motion  @xcite in the heat bath of qgp .",
    "therefore , the interaction of the heavy quarks with qgp may be treated as the interactions between equilibrium and non - equilibrium degrees of freedom .",
    "the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation provide an appropriate framework for the evolution of the heavy quark in the expanding qgp heat bath .",
    "the system under study has two components .",
    "the equilibrium components , the qgp , is assumed to be formed at a temperature @xmath5 at an initial time @xmath6 after the nuclear collisions .",
    "the qgp , due to its high internal pressure expands , as a consequence it cools and reverts to hadronic phase at a temperature , @xmath7 .",
    "the non - equilibrium component , the heavy quarks produced due to the collision of partons of the colliding nuclei has momentum distribution determined by the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , which evolves due to their interaction with the expanding qgp background .",
    "the evolution of the heavy quark momentum distribution is governed by the fp equation .",
    "the interaction of the heavy quarks with the qgp is contained in the drag and diffusion coefficients .",
    "the drag and diffusion coefficients are provided as inputs , which are , in general , dependent on both temperature and momentum .",
    "the evolution of the temperature of the background qgp with time is governed by relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the solution of the fp equation at the ( phase ) transition point for the charm and bottom quarks gives the ( quenched ) momentum distribution of hadrons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons ) through fragmentation .",
    "the fragmentation of the initial momentum distribution of the heavy quarks results in the unquenched momentum distribution of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons .",
    "the ratio of the quenched to the unquenched @xmath1 distribution is the nuclear suppression factor which is experimentally measured .",
    "the quenching is due to the dragging of the heavy quark by qgp .",
    "hence the properties of the qgp can be extracted from the suppression factor .",
    "in contrast to earlier works where the momentum dependence of the drag coefficient were ignored ( or considered its value at low momentum ) in the present work we emphasize on its momentum dependence .    the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the fp equation , in section iii the drag coefficients for collisional and radiative processes have been discussed . in section",
    "iv the initial conditions and the space time evolution of the system have been described .",

    "we need to evaluate the collision integral for a situation where one of the colliding partner is in thermal equilibrium .    to proceed in this direction ,",
