    "liquid crystals are an intermediate phase of matter between the commonly observed solid and liquid phases @xcite . in the simplest liquid crystal phase ,",
    "the nematic phase , the constituent rod  like molecules translate freely as in a conventional liquid but whilst flowing , tend to align along certain locally preferred directions i.e. they exhibit a certain degree of long - range orientational ordering .",
    "liquid crystals have attracted a lot of interest in recent years because of their unique physical properties and continue to do so because of their diverse applications @xcite and their analogies to other physical systems .",
    "the mathematical theory of nematic liquid crystals is very rich ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of any mathematical theory for nematic liquid crystals is the definition of an _ order parameter _ that distinguishes the ordered nematic phase from the disordered isotropic liquid phase .",
    "mean - field liquid crystal theories , such as the maier - saupe theory , describe the liquid crystal configuration in terms of a probability distribution function @xmath1 on the unit sphere .",
    "the order - parameter , known as the @xmath0-tensor order parameter , is defined in terms of the second moment of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "probabilistic second - moment definition _ naturally requires @xmath0 to be a symmetric , traceless @xmath2 matrix and imposes certain constraints on its eigenvalues , which represent the degree of ordering .",
    "the landau - de gennes theory , on the other hand , is a continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals and does not contain any information about either @xmath1 or the intermolecular interactions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-tensor order parameter , within the landau - de gennes framework , is a symmetric , traceless @xmath3 matrix with no a priori constraints on the eigenvalues .",
    "the landau - de gennes energy functional is a nonlinear integral functional of @xmath0 and its spatial derivatives and the equilibrium , physically observable configurations correspond to either global or local minimizers of this energy subject to the imposed boundary conditions .",
    "a natural question of interest is - do the equilibrium configurations predicted by the landau - de gennes theory agree with the probabilistic second - moment definition of @xmath0 ?",
    "we systematically address this question in this paper .",
    "we obtain explicit bounds for the scalar order parameters of global energy minimizers , referred to as _ equilibrium scalar order parameters _ , in terms of the temperature and the material - dependent constants .",
    "these bounds quantify ( to some extent ) the competing effects of the different terms in the landau - de gennes energy density .",
    "further , these bounds are compared to the probabilistic second - moment definition of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to explicitly delineate the regions of agreement and the regions of disagreement and we find that the landau - de gennes predictions do nt match the probabilistic second - moment definition in the low - temperature regime .",
    "in particular , the equilibrium scalar order parameters , within the landau - de gennes framework , can take physically unrealistic values ( larger than unity ) in the low - temperature regime .",
    "our results largely depend on the use of maximum principle type of arguments for nonlinear elliptic systems of partial differential equations and they can be readily extended to more general energy functionals than the ones considered in this paper .",
    "the derivation of the landau - de gennes energy density is valid near the isotropic state , close to the nematic - isotropic transition temperature .",
    "therefore , it is well - expected that the predictions are physically unrealistic in the low temperature regime .",
    "however , our results show that the landau - de gennes predictions fail to be consistent with the probabilistic second - moment definition within a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the nematic - isotropic transition temperature . in principle",
    ", one would want to develop a continuum theory that works for all temperature regimes . in the last part of the paper",
    ", we briefly outline a ginzburg - landau approach that remedies the flawed predictions in the low temperature regimes .",
    "we define a modified landau - de gennes energy functional such that the energy density blows up whenever the liquid crystal configuration violates the constraints imposed by the probabilistic second - moment definition of @xmath0 or equivalently whenever the scalar order parameters are physically unrealistic .",
    "one deficiency of this approach is that it has no apparent connection with the mean - field microscopic approaches .",
    "a different approach has been suggested in @xcite and we hope to systematically investigate a microscopic - macroscopic derivation of a continuum energy functional in future work @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we review the probabilistic second - moment definition of the order parameter . in section  [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "we study equilibrium liquid crystal configurations within the continuum landau  de gennes theory . in section  3.1 , we consider spatially homogeneous cases whereas in sections  3.2 and 3.3 , we include spatial inhomogeneities into the model and obtain upper bounds for the corresponding equilibrium scalar order parameters .",
    "these bounds explicitly define the domain for the equilibrium scalar order parameters in terms of the temperature and the material - dependent parameters . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we discuss the main results and conclusions of this paper and suggest future research directions .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the probabilistic second - moment definition of the @xmath0-tensor order parameter and the maier - saupe mean - field liquid crystal theory .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for details and we present the main points here for completeness .    within the simplest microscopic model , the nematic molecules are modelled by elongated rods where the long molecular axes tend to align along certain locally preferred directions @xcite .",
    "the state of alignment of the nematic molecules is described by a probability distribution function for the molecular orientations on the unit sphere , @xmath4 , since @xmath5 is the space of all admissible directions .",
