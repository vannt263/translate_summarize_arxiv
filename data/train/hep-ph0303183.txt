    "models with extra dimensions have attracted great attention in recent years as they offer new perspectives on challenging problems in modern physics .",
    "it was demonstrated by randall and sundrum that a small but warped extra dimension provides an elegant solution to the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the fifth dimension is an @xmath1 orbifold with an ads@xmath2 geometry of curvature @xmath3 , bordered by two 3-branes with opposite tensions and separated by distance @xmath4 .",
    "the red shift induced by the ads warp factor @xmath5 generates an exponential hierarchy between the energy scales on the two branes .",
    "if the brane separation is @xmath6 , the scale on the negative tension brane is of tev - size , while the scale on the other brane is of order @xmath7 .",
    "the ads curvature @xmath3 and the 5d planck mass @xmath8 are assumed to be of order @xmath7 .",
    "gravity is weak at the tev - brane because the zero mode corresponding to the 4d graviton is localized at the positive tension brane ( planck - brane ) .",
    "in contrast to the original proposal @xcite we take the standard model ( sm ) fermions and gauge bosons as bulk fields . in the non - supersymmetric framework we are studying , the higgs field has to be confined to the tev - brane in order to preserve the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "our motivation is twofold . with the sm fermions residing in the 5-dimensional bulk",
    ", the hierarchy of quark and lepton masses can be related to a higher dimensional geography @xcite .",
    "different fermion flavors are localized at different positions in the extra dimension or , more precisely , have different wave functions .",
    "the fermion masses are in direct proportion to the overlap of their wave functions with the higgs field @xcite . also the ckm mixing can be explained along these lines .",
    "a second point is that at the tev - brane non - renormalizable operators , now only tev - scale suppressed , are known to induce rapid proton decay , large neutrino masses and flavor violating interactions . because of the warp factor , the effective cut - off scale varies along the extra dimension .",
    "if the quarks and leptons are localized towards the planck - brane in the extra dimension , the suppression scales of dangerous operators can be significantly enhanced @xcite .",
    "small majorana neutrino masses can then arise from dimension - five interactions , without introducing new degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies can be satisfactorily resolved .",
    "alternatively , dirac neutrino masses can be generated by a coupling to right - handed neutrinos in the bulk @xcite .",
    "fields living in the 5d bulk can be expanded as a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states .",
    "electroweak observables , in particular the weak mixing angle and gauge boson masses , require the kk excitations of sm particles to be heavier than about 10 tev @xcite .",
    "a small hierarchy separates the weak and kk scales . in the presence of brane - localized kinetic terms",
    "the bound on the kk scale may be somewhat relaxed @xcite , but we are not considering this possibility in the following . for fermions confined to the tev - brane ,",
    "the electroweak constraints have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of flavor violation in the warped sm which is an immediate consequence of our approach to the fermion mass problem .",
    "some aspects of this topic have already been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the crucial connection to the issue of fermion masses , however , has not been thoroughly investigated so far .",
    "this connection allows us to obtain more reliable predictions for the flavor violating rates .",
    "moreover , we are including lepton flavor violating processes which have not yet been considered in context of the warped sm .",
    "some results have already been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we summarize some results on bulk fermions and gauge bosons in a warped background . in section 3",
    "we are using the observed fermion masses and mixings to determine the locations of the various fermion flavors in the extra dimension",
    ". the fermion mass pattern can be accommodated without relying on hierarchical yukawa couplings . in section 4",
    "we discuss how the mixing between different kk levels leads to a non - unitary ckm matrix . flavor violation by ( kk ) gauge boson exchange , being a natural consequence of our setup , is studied in section 5 .",
    "we find that with a kk scale of 10 tev the model is consistent with the experimental constraints , while some processes , such as muon - electron conversion , are within reach of next generation experiments . in section 6 we show that contributions from non - renormalizable operators to flavor violating processes are naturally within experimental bounds , while proton decay can not by adequately suppressed .",
    "finally , in section 7 we conclude .",
    "we assume that the standard model gauge bosons and fermions reside in the bulk of the warped 5d space - time @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",

    "the ads curvature @xmath3 is related to the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tensions . to set the notation",
    "let us briefly review some properties of gauge and fermion fields in a slice of ads@xmath2 .",
    "a gauge field propagating in a curved background with metric @xmath13 is described by the equation of motion @xmath14 the mass term @xmath15 arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking and is present only for the weak gauge bosons .",
    "since the higgs field is localized at the tev - brane , we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the 5d gauge coupling . the higgs vev @xmath18 is expected to be of order @xmath7 . imposing the gauge @xmath19",
    ", we decompose the 5d fields as @xmath20    inserting the metric ( [ met ] ) and the decomposition ( [ kka ] ) into the equation of motion ( [ el ] ) , the wave functions @xmath21 have to satisfy @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",

    "the normalization constants are fixed by @xmath27    in the case @xmath28 eq .  ( [ el ] ) admits a constant zero mode solution @xcite .",
    "the excited states are localized towards the tev - brane and have tev - scale kk masses @xmath29 . in the presence of the mass term @xmath15",
    ", the zero mode acquires a mass @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the kk scale .",
    "the order @xmath32 corrections are related to a dip in the zero mode wave function caused by the boundary mass term @xcite .",
    "compared to the 4d standard model they induce a tree - level shift of the w and z boson mass ratio relative to its 4d standard model value . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the electroweak precision data thus implies the constraint @xmath33 tev . if the boundary mass term was not included in the kk reduction , but evaluated with the @xmath28 wave functions , the order @xmath32 effects would show up in the 4d effective action as mixings between the kk states .",
    "the equation of motion of a fermion in curved space - time reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fnfbein , @xmath36 are the dirac matrices in flat space , and @xmath37 is the spin connection induced by the metric ( [ met ] ) .",
    "fermions have two possible transformation properties under the @xmath38 orbifold symmetry , @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 is odd under @xmath38 , and the dirac mass term , which is odd as well , can be parametrized as @xmath41 .",
    "the dirac mass should therefore originate from the coupling to a @xmath38 odd scalar field which acquires a vev . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath42 is even . using the metric ( [ met ] )",

    "the fermion is localized near the boundary at @xmath57 @xmath58 , i.e.  at the planck- ( tev- ) brane ( see also fig .",
    "[ f_1 ] ) .",
    "the zero modes of leptons and quarks acquire masses from their coupling to the higgs field @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the 5d yukawa couplings .",
    "the 4d dirac masses are given by @xmath61 in the second step we have used @xmath62 and introduced the dimensionless couplings @xmath63 .    the gauge interaction between bulk gauge bosons and fermions , @xmath64 , induces the effective 4d couplings @xcite @xmath65 between the different kk levels . in the case of a massless gauge boson ( @xmath66 )",
    "this integral reduces to the normalization condition of fermions ( [ normferm ] ) , and one finds @xmath67 . for a massive gauge field the gauge coupling of the zero mode to tev - brane fermions is somewhat reduced due to the dip in its wave function @xcite . in the sm",
    "this effect leads , for instance , to smaller gauge couplings of w and z bosons relative to that of the photon . in order to keep these corrections within experimental bounds we derived in ref .",
    "@xcite the constraint @xmath68 tev if the fermions reside on the tev - brane . for fermions localized towards the planck - brane this constraint becomes weaker than the 10 tev bound from the gauge boson masses discussed before .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ mg0 ] ) and ( [ gc ] ) , we can determine the higgs vev required to provide the measured gauge boson masses . to keep the electroweak corrections small enough",
    ", we take @xmath69 tev . assuming @xmath70 we find @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , there is still a small hierarchy of about twenty between the fundamental scale and the higgs vev .",
    "the fermion masses crucially depend on the overlap of the fermion wave functions and the higgs profile .",
    "they are functions of the 5d mass parameters of the left- and right - handed fermions , @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , which enter eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) . as the 5d dirac mass , i.e.  @xmath75 parameter increases ,",
    "the fermion gets localized closer towards the planck - brane .",
    "its overlap with the higgs profile at the tev - brane is reduced , which is reflected in a smaller 4d fermion mass from electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "since the fermionic zero modes depend exponentially on the 5d mass parameters , the large hierarchy of charged fermion masses can be generated from @xmath75 parameters of order unity @xcite . if right - handed neutrinos are introduced in the bulk , sub - ev neutrino masses",
    "can be explained in the same manner @xcite .",
    "building up the fermion mass matrices from eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) requires also the specification of the 5d yukawa couplings .",
    "thus there are considerably more independent parameters in the model than there are observable fermion masses and mixings . relating the measured fermion properties to their locations in the extra dimension",
    "needs therefore additional assumptions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the 5d yukawa couplings are of order unity , and the fermion mass pattern is solely due to the different locations .",
    "additionally , the fermions were localized as closely as possible towards the planck - brane in order to maximally suppress the impact of non - renormalizable operators on rare processes .    in the following",
    "we are using a somewhat different approach .",
    "while still assuming the 5d yukawa couplings to be of order unity , we are looking for a set of @xmath75 parameters which `` most naturally '' accounts for the observed fermion masses and mixings .",
    "more precisely , we are taking random 5d yukawa couplings and require the averaged fermion properties to fit the experimental data .",
    "similar methods have been used to study models where the fermion mass pattern is due to ( approximately ) conserved charges @xcite . there",
    "the role of the fermion locations is taken by a set of higgs fields .",
    "let us first focus on the quark sector .",
    "at the scale of 10 tev , where we are matching our model to the observational data , the ( running ) quark masses are @xmath76 we have used one loop renormalization group equations @xcite to run the quark masses given in ref .",
    "@xcite from the scale @xmath77 to 10 tev .",
    "the running reduces the quark masses by about 20 percent .",

    "there is a slow increase @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and an exponential suppression @xmath86 for @xmath55 .",
    "note that some non - equal yukawa couplings are needed to render the mass matrix ( [ product ] ) non - singular .",

    "so in fact there is a one parameter family of solutions , labeled , for instance , by @xmath112 .",
    "however , if some of the light quarks are localized towards the tev - brane ( @xmath85 ) , large deviations from electroweak precision variables drive the kk scale far above 10 tev @xcite . in section 5",
    "we will see that in this case flavor violation is greatly enhanced . since @xmath113 is already close to 1/2 , we can not move the right - handed quarks much closer to the tev - brane .",
    "this would also require to localize the right - handed top quark extremely close towards the tev - brane by @xmath114 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath115 can not be localized much closer towards the tev - brane without getting too large modifications of the left - handed bottom couplings .",

    "however , very large yukawa couplings @xmath118 introduce a new and unexplained hierarchy in the model . taking yukawa couplings @xmath119 would mean to move the quarks closer towards the tev - brane which worsens the electroweak fit .",
