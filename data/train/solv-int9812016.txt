    "one of the most characteristic properties of scattering in string theory , as well as in some strong interaction processes , is the so - called @xmath1 duality .",
    "schematically , it can be represented as in figure  [ fig s - t duality ] .",
    "we assume here the point of view that the 4-point amplitudes @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are some ` quantum numbers ' , in both sides of figure  [ fig s - t duality ] are obtained out of two 3-point amplitudes @xmath4 by integrating away the quantum number corresponding to the internal line , so that analytically the duality looks like a(k , l , s)a(s , m , n ) ( s)=a(k , m , t)a(t , l , n ) ( t ) , [ eq duality ] where @xmath5 is some measure . in  ( [ eq duality ] )",
    "the 3-point amplitude is assumed to be symmetric in all its arguments .",
    "if it is not , the formula  ( [ eq duality ] ) must be written more carefully , as we will see below in section  [ sec k s ] .    as is known , the @xmath1 duality results in a dramatic reduction of the number of feynman diagrams : any two diagrams with the same numbers of external lines and cycles are equivalent .    what mathematical structures form the basis of such duality",
    "of course , within the usual string theory it can be explained ` geometrically ' by saying that to the two sides of figure  [ fig s - t duality ] corresponds in fact the same ` string diagram ' ( figure  [ fig s - t string ] ) .",
    "suppose , however , that we want to have a general algebraic mechanism for @xmath1 duality irrespective of such pictures and hopefully providing new possibilities for constructing string - like theories .",
    "string theory has intimate connections with many fields of mathematics .",
    "we are mostly interested in its relations with integrable models .",
    "so , let us mention here the string ",
    "soliton correspondence  @xcite and the fact that the string amplitudes satisfy the yang  baxter equation  @xcite .    there exist , however , different kinds of fundamental equations responsible for integrability .",
    "the most important is believed to be the tetrahedron equation ( te ) , which deals with @xmath6-dimensional integrability : the quantum te  @xcite for quantum models and the functional te  @xcite for both classical and quantum models . at the same time , the different equations are strongly connected with one another . in particular ,",
    "the tetrahedron equation is connected with the _ pentagon equation _",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we argue that the mathematical structure responsible for @xmath1 duality is the functional pentagon equation  ( fpe ) .",
    "we demonstrate it on simple examples .",
    "as is known , strings have close relations with infinite - dimensional groups . nevertheless , we believe it is natural to start from fpe solutions related to finite - dimensional lie groups .",
    "so , the modest aim of this paper is to demonstrate that there can exist some algebraic mechanism for @xmath1 duality based on fpe solutions , and if we can pass from finite - dimensional to infinite - dimensional groups ( which looks very plausible ) , we will obtain wide range of new string - like theories .",
    "below , in section  [ sec pentagon ] we explain what is the fpe and how it arises naturally when dealing with @xmath1 duality . in sections  [ sec lengths ] and  [ sec k s ] we present two simple geometric constructions for 3-point amplitudes that obey duality . the amplitude of section  [ sec k s ] generalizes the well - known veneziano 4-particle amplitude .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec discussion ] we show that our constructions can be described algebraically in terms of relations in lie groups , namely the group of movements of euclidean plane and the heisenberg group .",
    "our idea of a duality mechanism is very simple .",
    "suppose that , for any fixed quantum numbers on the external lines of both sides in figure  [ fig s - t duality ] , there exists some correspondence law @xmath7 such that t = f(s ) a(k , l , s)a(s , m , n)(s ) = a(k , m , t)a(t , l , n)(t ) .",
    "[ eq s - t transformation ] here it is implied tacitly that function @xmath8 also depends on the ` outer ' variables @xmath9 and  @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear that ( [ eq s - t transformation ] ) is sufficient for ( [ eq duality ] ) to hold .",
    "consider now the scattering diagram  ( a ) in figure  [ fig s - t pentagon ]    and transform it into the diagram  ( b ) in two ways , as shown in the figure .",
    "suppose that some quantum numbers have been attached to _ all _ lines of diagram  ( a ) ( including the internal ones ) .",
    "using the function  @xmath8 , we get quantum numbers for diagram  ( b ) as well .",
    "it is very natural to require that the function  @xmath8 satisfy the compatibility condition : _ two sequences of transformations in figure  [ fig s - t pentagon ] must result in the same quantum numbers for diagram  ( b)_. and this compatibility condition is nothing but some version of functional pentagon equation .    to see where the pentagon is ,",
    "let us draw a ` poincar dual ' for figure  [ fig s - t pentagon ] as figure  [ fig pentagon ] .    here",
    "the vertices of figure  [ fig s - t pentagon ] are represented as triangles , and to a transform of the type of figure  [ fig s - t duality ] corresponds deleting of a diagonal of a quadrilateral and replacing it with the other diagonal .",
    "note that the variables ( quantum numbers ) are attached to the _ edges _ ( sides and diagonals ) of the pentagon .",
    "there exist also other versions of fpe where variables belong e.g.  to the triangles themselves , see  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical picture of figure  [ fig pentagon ] suggests at once a possibility for choosing function  @xmath8 .",
    "namely , let us draw , as figure  [ fig lengths ] , the ` poincar dual ' of figure  [ fig s - t duality ] on the euclidean plane and take the _ lengths of edges _ as ` quantum numbers ' .",
    "if the lengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 of edges in figure  [ fig lengths ]    are given , then @xmath13 is determined from the equation s_abd+s_bcd = s_abc+s_acd , [ eq areas ] where @xmath14 is the area of the corresponding triangle expressed through the lengths of its sides .",
    "for example , @xmath15    the fact that such a transformation @xmath16 obeys the pentagon equation is evident from geometrical argument ( a pentagon in which the lengths of all sides and two diagonals are given is a ` rigid body ' where distance between any two points is fixed and does not depend on a chain of algebraic transformations we have used to calculate it ) .    consider the obvious relation ( + ) = -(+ ) [ eq angles ] for the angles in figure  [ fig lengths ] , and let the sides of the quadrilateral  @xmath17 be fixed and only its diagonals vary .",
    "using formulae like @xmath18 we will find @xmath19 and similarly for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "substituting these angle differentials into ( [ eq angles ] ) and taking ( [ eq areas ] ) into account , it is not hard to derive the relation = -l_6l_6s_abcs_acd .",
    "[ eq ldl / ss ]    the relation ( [ eq ldl / ss ] ) together with ( [ eq areas ] ) suggests the following form for 3-point amplitude @xmath22 and measure @xmath23 satisfying the condition  ( [ eq s - t transformation ] ) : a(l_1,l_2,l_3)=e^s(l_1,l_2,l_3)s(l_1,l_2,l_3 ) , [ eq lengths amplitude ] where @xmath24 is an overall arbitrary constant , and ( l)=ll . [ eq lengths measure ]    as for the minus sign in ( [ eq ldl / ss ] ) , its role becomes clear when we choose the integration path in @xmath25 and/or @xmath13 .",
    "here some freedom seems to exist .",
    "if we regard the lengths as complex variables , the equation ( [ eq areas ] ) determines , for fixed @xmath26 and @xmath12 , some riemann surface whose points are pairs @xmath27 .",
    "so , probably , some cycles on that surface can be taken as integration contours . here",
    "we will not go that far , but just navely assume @xmath17 to be a convex quadrilateral in a usual real euclidean plane , and let @xmath25 change from its minimal value compatible with this assumption ( and with given @xmath26 and @xmath12 ) to its maximal value .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath13 changes from _ its maximal value to its minimal value_. if we reverse the direction of integration in @xmath13 , the minus sign disappears , and finally the formula  ( [ eq duality ] ) acquires the form @xmath28",
    "figure  [ fig pentagon ] suggests in fact one more choice of a transformation satisfying the fpe .",
    "let us take as a quantum number the _ angular coefficient _  @xmath29 of a given edge ( if the ends of the edge are @xmath30 and @xmath31 in some fixed frame of reference , not necessarily orthogonal , then @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that if values @xmath33 and @xmath34 in figure  [ fig k s ]    are given , then @xmath35 is determined uniquely .",
    "let us write the formula for finding  @xmath35 in the following form : = k_6-k_2k_6-k_4 .",
    "[ eq k s ] the structure of this relation is f(abd)g(bcd)=h(abc)k(acd ) , [ eq * ] by which we mean that the l.h.s .",
    "is the product of two expressions corresponding to triangles @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , while the r.h.s",
    ".  corresponds in a similar way to triangles @xmath38 and  @xmath39 .",
    "so , relation  ( [ eq k s ] ) is similar to  ( [ eq areas ] ) , although it is ` multiplicative ' rather than ` additive ' .",
    "note that ( a)equation  ( [ eq k s ] ) has also the solution @xmath40 which we are not interested in .",
    "let us agree that we have rejected that solution ; ( b)the transformation @xmath41 , given @xmath42 and @xmath34 , is an involution .",
    "the fact that the transformation @xmath8 obeys the pentagon equation follows from the fact that a pentagon for which the angular coefficients of all sides and two diagonals are given is determined uniquely up to a similarity and a shift .    remarkably , there exist two more multiplicative relations yielding the same dependence @xmath41 and having the same structure  ( [ eq * ] ) : = k_4-k_2k_4-k_6 [ eq * 2 ] and = k_2-k_6k_2-k_4 .",
    "[ eq * 3 ]    for the analog of formula  ( [ eq ldl / ss ] ) we can take = -k_6(k_6-k_2)(k_6-k_5 ) .",
    "[ eq dk ] the reader can verify that ( [ eq dk ] ) follows from ( [ eq k s ] ) , provided @xmath43 .",
    "an important feature of formulae ( [ eq ks][eq dk ] ) is that they remain valid after a mbius ( rational ) transformation of all @xmath29 s : @xmath44 such transformations correspond just to another choice of coordinate axes for figure  [ fig k s ] .    the most general formula of type  ( [ eq duality ] ) that we can obtain from ( [ eq ks][eq dk ] ) results from raising all terms in ( [ eq k s ] ) to some degree  @xmath45 , in ( [ eq * 2 ] ) to some degree  @xmath46 , in ( [ eq * 3 ] ) to some degree  @xmath47 and multiplying all together with corresponding terms of  ( [ eq dk ] ) .",
    "using the fact that @xmath48 we can choose e.g.  a curve joining @xmath49 and @xmath34 as the integration path , and write the final formula as @xmath50 where a(l , m , n | , , ) = ( l - m)^- ( m - n)^- ( n - l)^--1 .",
    "[ eq amplitude k s ]    both sides of ( [ eq duality k s ] ) generalize the well - known veneziano expression  @xcite for the 4-point amplitude . to see this ,",
    "let us put @xmath51 then , for example , the l.h.s . of ( [ eq duality k s ] ) yields , up to a constant multiplier , @xmath52 which coincides with the veneziano amplitude up to the obvious change of notations",
    ".    it will be certainly of big interest to compare the _ five_-point and , more generally , @xmath53-point amplitudes that can be obtained in such way with those in classical papers  @xcite .",
    "let us explain why we believe that our constructions are related to lie groups .",
    "consider two transformations acting on points @xmath54 of a euclidean plane : shifting by  @xmath55 along the @xmath56  axis s(a ) ( x , y)(x+a , y ) [ eq s(a ) ] and rotation through the angle  @xmath57 @xmath58 then , the existence of a triangle with sides @xmath59 and _ external _ angles @xmath60 means the equality r()s(n)r()s(l)r()s(m)= * 1*. [ eq 6-term ]    note that the group of movements of a euclidean plane is three - parametric , and that is why @xmath61 and  @xmath47 can be determined from given @xmath62 and  @xmath10 .",
    "similar to  ( [ eq 6-term ] ) relations can be written also for quadrilaterals and pentagons , and all the geometric constructions of section  [ sec lengths ] can be described in terms of such relations .    as for section  [ sec k s ] ,",
    "its constructions have nothing to do with euclidean distance , so , in our opinion , here more relevant is the three - parametric group generated by the transformations  @xmath63  ( [ eq s(a ) ] ) and @xmath64 then the existence of a triangle whose sides have @xmath56-projections @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 ) and angular coefficients @xmath59 is described by the equality s(a)t(l - m)s(b)t(m - n)s(c)t(n - l)=*1*. [ eq 6-term ]    from the abstract point of view , the group generated by @xmath63 and @xmath67 is nothing but the heisenberg group .",
    "one can readily see this from the relation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a central element for any  @xmath55 .",
