    "many additional aspects of this problem have been investigated within the rubrics of vicious random walks @xcite and `` friendly '' random walks @xcite .    in this work , we study two related and complementary random walk ordering problems . in the `` leader '' problem ,",
    "we ask for the probability @xmath17 that the initially leftmost particle in a group of @xmath0 particles remains to the left of all the other particles up to time @xmath12 @xcite . in the `` laggard '' problem ,",
    "we are concerned with the probability @xmath2 that the initially rightmost particle from a group of @xmath0 particles never attains the lead ( becomes leftmost ) .",
    "these two probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay algebraically @xmath18 as @xmath19 and our basic goal is to determine the exponents @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these ordering problems arise in a variety of contexts .",
    "physical applications include wetting phenomena @xcite and three - dimensional lorentzian gravity @xcite .",
    "a more probabilistic application is the ballot problem @xcite , where one is interested in the probability that the vote for a single candidate remains ahead of all the other candidates throughout the counting ; this is just a restatement of the leader problem .",
    "another example is that of the lamb and the lions @xcite , in which one is interested in the survival of a diffusing lamb in the presence of many diffusing lions . in one dimension ,",
    "a lamb that was initially in the lead must remain the leader to survive .    for the leader problem ,",

    "a numerical solution of the pertinent laplace equation gives @xmath6 , a significant improvement over the previously - quoted estimate @xmath29 @xcite . in sec .",
    "v , we turn to the laggard problem and give an asymptotic estimate for the exponent @xmath21 . concluding remarks and some open questions",
    "are given in sec .",
    "we begin by mapping the original problem of @xmath0 diffusing particles @xmath30 on the line onto a single effective diffusing particle located at @xmath31 in @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "the particle order constraints on the line translate to bounding hyperplanes within which the effective particle is confined @xcite .",
    "the effective particle is absorbed if it hits one of these boundaries .",
    "for the leader problem , the explicit shape of these bounding hyperplanes can be easily worked out for the cases @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; we will later extend this analysis to the 4-particle system .    for 2 particles , their separation undergoes simple diffusion and the process terminates when the separation equals zero .",
    "thus the survival probability of the leader decays as @xmath34 . to fix notation and ideas for later sections",
    ", we now study the 3-particle system . for a leader at @xmath35 and particles at @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ", we view these coordinates as equivalent to the isotropic diffusion of a single effective particle at @xmath38 in three dimensions .",
    "whenever this effective particle crosses the plane @xmath39 , the original walkers at @xmath40 and @xmath41 in one dimension have reversed their order .",
    "there are three such planes @xmath42 that divide space into @xmath43 domains , corresponding to the @xmath44 possible orderings of the three walkers ( fig .",
    "[ planes](a ) ) .",
    "these planes all intersect along the @xmath45 axis .",
    "we may simplify this description by projecting onto the plane @xmath46 that contains the origin and is perpendicular to the @xmath45 axis .",
    "now the plane @xmath47 may be written parametrically as @xmath48 and its intersection with the plane @xmath46 is the line @xmath49 .",

    "the union of these two domains defines a wedge of opening angle @xmath61 .",
    "since the survival probability of a diffusing particle within a wedge of arbitrary opening angle @xmath62 and absorbing boundaries decays asymptotically as @xmath63 @xcite , we deduce the known result that the leader survival probability exponent is @xmath23 .",
    "for more than 3 particles , the domain for the effective particle is geometrically more complex and the corresponding solution to the diffusion equation does not seem tractable .",
    "we therefore recast the survival probability of the effective diffusing particle in terms of the simpler problem of the electrostatic potential of a point charge within the same geometric domain @xcite .",
    "let @xmath64 be the survival probability of a diffusing particle within an infinite wedge - shaped @xmath65-dimensional domain with absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath66 be the electrostatic potential due to a point charge within the same domain , with @xmath67 on the boundary .",
    "generically , these two quantities have the asymptotic behaviors @xmath68    more relevant for our purposes , these two quantities are simply related by @xcite @xmath69 this equivalence arises because the integral of the diffusion equation over all time is just the laplace equation . thus the time integral of the survival probability has the same asymptotic behavior as the spatial integral of the electrostatic potential over the portion of the domain that is accessible by a diffusing particle up to time @xmath12 . substituting the respective asymptotic behaviors from eqs .",

    ", we can then determine the original ordering probability .    to illustrate this approach ,",
    "let us determine the various ordering probabilities of 3 particles on the line in terms of the equivalent electrostatic problem .",
    "in fact , it is simpler to work backwards and find the equivalent ordering problem that corresponds to a specific wedge domain , for example , consider the @xmath72 wedge 123 in fig .",

    "the solution with the smallest eigenvalue is @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78 , leading to the known result @xmath79 , for 3 vicious walkers .",
