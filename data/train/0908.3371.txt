    "bilayer graphene has attracted much interest partly due to the opening of a tunable gap in its electronic spectrum by an external electrostatic field . such a phenomenon was predicted in refs . @xcite and can be observed in optical studies controlled by applying a gate bias @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , within the self - consistent hartree approximation , the gap was derived as a near - linear function of the carrier concentration injected in the bilayer by the gate bias .",
    "recently , this problem was numerically considered in ref .",
    "@xcite using the density functional theory ( dft ) and including the external charge doping involved with impurities .",
    "the dft calculation gives the gap which is roughly half of the gap obtained in the hartree approximation .",
    "this disagreement was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite as a result of both the inter- and intralayer correlations .    in this work",
    ", we study this problem within the same hartree approximation as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but including the effect of external doping .",
    "we calculate the carrier concentration on both sides of the bilayer considering the case , where the carrier concentration in the bilayer is less than 10@xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "then , we minimize the total energy of the system and find self - consistently both the chemical potential and the gap induced by the gate bias . our results completely differ from those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the external doping is disregarded . in the presence of dopants , the dependence of the gap on the carrier concentration , i.e. , on the gate voltage , exhibits an asymmetry at the electron and hole sides of the gate bias .",
    "the graphene bilayer lattice is shown in fig . [ grlat ] .",
    "atoms in one layer , i.e. , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the unit cell , are connected by solid lines , and in the other layer , e.g. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , by the dashed lines .",
    "the atom @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) differs from @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) because it has a neighbor just below in the adjacent layer , whereas the atom @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) does not .",

    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath14 result in the position of levels at @xmath16 , but @xmath14 is much less than @xmath22 .",
    "there is in addition the parameter @xmath23 induced by the gate voltage and associated with the asymmetry of two layers in the external electrostatic field .",
    "this parameter presents the potential energy @xmath24 between two layers , where @xmath25 is the interlayer distance and @xmath26 is electric field induced both by the gate voltage and the external dopants in the bilayer .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 as well as the chemical potential @xmath27 should be self - consistently calculated for the given gate voltage . for this purpose , we can held only the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath22 , neglecting the small effect of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath14 on the gap @xmath23 . in this approximation",

    "the minimal value of the upper energy @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 band takes the maximal value @xmath36 at @xmath37 and the minimal value @xmath38 at @xmath39 because the value of @xmath23 is much less than @xmath22 , the distinction between @xmath23 and @xmath40 is small and the gap between the bands @xmath35 and @xmath41 takes approximately the value @xmath42 .",

    ", the filled bands do not contribute into the energy of the system , because the electron charge of the filled bands is compensated by the ion charge and this energy have to be considered as the ground state energy .",

    "all these numbers are supposed to be positive or negative for the electron or hole doping correspondingly .",
    "let us emphasize that the dielectric constant @xmath76 of bilayer graphene depends on the substrate . for simplicity",
    ", we put @xmath77 in the definition ( [ wf ] ) .",
    "we seek the minimum of the total energy @xmath78 as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath27 , and the lagrange multiplier @xmath79 .",

    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath79 can be excluded from these two equations .",
    "then , the equation obtained should be expanded in @xmath84 , since the thickness @xmath25 of the bilayer is much less than the thickness @xmath85 of the substrate .",
    "thus , we obtain the following equation : @xmath86 let us emphasize , that this equation is invariant under the simultaneous sign change in @xmath87 and @xmath88 , that expresses the charge invariance of the problem . at the fixed external doping @xmath88 ,",

    "( [ n1 ] ) ] .",
    "we obtain solution @xmath96 . according to eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , the gap as a function of the carrier concentration takes a very simple form : @xmath97 where the right - hand side does not depend at all on the gate bias , but only on the screening constant @xmath98 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ bifig3 ] in dashed lines , it is symmetrical on the electron and hole sides .    with the help of eq .",

    "@xcite : @xmath100^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] both equations give approximately the same results at @xmath101 @xmath1 .",
    "however , contrary to eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) contains the carrier concentration in the right - hand side giving rise to the more rapid increase in the gap with @xmath102 .",
    "this increase also contradicts to the dft calculations @xcite .",
    "two reasons can result in the disagreement of our theory with ref .",
    "first , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the filled bands are supposed to create the electric field in the bilayer , that is incorrect as explained in the previous section .",
    "second , the minimization should be done with respect two variables @xmath27 and @xmath23 , however , only one of them seems to be exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite .      for the bilayer with the acceptor or donor dopants , eq .",
    "( [ var1 ] ) presents a solution @xmath103 as a function of @xmath80 .",
    "we obtain , evidently , the small values of @xmath104 for @xmath80 close to @xmath105 . since @xmath106 , we can expand the function in the right - hand of eq .",
    "( [ var1 ] ) in @xmath107 . in this region of the relatively large @xmath36",
    ", we find again with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ n ] ) and ( [ var1 ] ) the linear dependence @xmath108    the value of the carrier concentration @xmath109 corresponds to the zero bias voltage , where @xmath110 ( see fig .",
    "[ bifig3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in contrast with the undoped case , the gap demonstrates the asymmetrical behavior on the electron and hole sides .",
    "if the bilayer contains acceptors with concentration @xmath74 , the gap decreases linearly with the hole concentration and vanishes , when the gate bias is not applied and the hole concentration equals @xmath111 . starting from this point , the gap increases and , thereafter , becomes again small ( equals zero in fig . [ bifig3 ] ) at the carrier concentration corresponding to the minimal value of the dc conductivity , where @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the difference ( @xmath113@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ bifig3 ] ) observed in refs . @xcite and @xcite between these two values of carrier concentrations , at the zero bias and at the minimal conductivity",
    ", gives directly the donor / acceptor concentration ( @xmath111 ) on the layer close to the substrate .",
    "then , for the gate bias applied in order to increase the electron concentration , the gap is rapidly opening with the electron appearance .",
    "we see , that the asymmetry arises between the electron and hole sides of the gate bias .",
    "this asymmetry can simulate a result of the hopping integral @xmath14 in the electron spectrum @xcite . in order to obtain the gap dependence for the case of electron doping , @xmath114 , the reflection transformation @xmath115 has to be made .",
    "this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ bifig4 ] where the experimental data from ref .",
    "@xcite are displayed .",
    "the gap in the vicinity of the minimal conductivity value could reach indeed a finite value due to several reasons .",
    "one of them is the form of the `` mexican hat '' shown in fig .",
    "second , the trigonal warping is substantial at low carrier concentrations . finally , the graphene electron spectrum is unstable with respect to the coulomb interaction at the low momentum values .",
    "for the graphene monolayer , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the logarithmic corrections appear at the small momentum . in the case of the bilayer ,",
    "the electron self - energy contains the linear corrections , as can be found using the perturbation theory .",
    "the similar linear terms resulting in a nematic order were also obtained in the framework of the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the gap opening in the gated graphene bilayer has an intriguing behavior as a function of carrier concentration . in the presence of the external doping charge , i.e. donors or acceptors ,",
    "this function is asymmetric on the hole and electron sides of the gate bias and it is the linear function only for the large gate bias .",
    "a difference between two values of carrier concentrations , i.e. at the zero bias and at the minimal conductivity , gives directly the sign and concentration of the charged dopants on the bilayer .",
