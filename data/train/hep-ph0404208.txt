    "the method to construct guts with reduced independent parameters @xcite consists of searching for renormalization group invariant ( rgi ) relations holding below the planck scale , which in turn are preserved down to the gut scale . of particular interest is the possibility to find rgi relations among couplings that guarantee finitenes to all - orders in perturbation theory @xcite . in order to achieve the latter",
    "it is enough to study the uniqueness of the solutions to the one - loop finiteness conditions @xcite .",

    "the search for rgi relations and finiteness has been extended to the soft supersymmetry breaking sector ( ssb ) of these theories @xcite , which involves parameters of dimension one and two .",
    "eventually , the full theories can be made all - loop finite and their predictive power is extended to the higgs sector and the supersymmetric spectrum ( s - spectrum ) .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to start an exhaustive search of these latter predictions , as well as to provide a rather dense review of the subject .",
    "here let us review the main points and ideas concerning the _ reduction of couplings _ and _ finiteness _ in @xmath4 supersymmetric theories .",
    "a rgi relation among couplings @xmath5 , @xmath6 has to satisfy the partial differential equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9-function of @xmath5 . there",
    "exist ( @xmath10 ) independent @xmath11 s , and finding the complete set of these solutions is equivalent to solve the so - called reduction equations ( res ) @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the primary coupling and its @xmath9-function . using all the @xmath15 s to impose rgi relations",
    ", one can in principle express all the couplings in terms of a single coupling @xmath13 .",
    "the complete reduction , which formally preserves perturbative renormalizability , can be achieved by demanding a power series solution , whose uniqueness can be investigated at the one - loop level .",
    "finiteness can be understood by considering a chiral , anomaly free ,  @xmath4 globally supersymmetric gauge theory based on a group g with gauge coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "the superpotential of the theory is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( the mass terms ) and @xmath18 ( the yukawa couplings ) are gauge invariant tensors and the matter field @xmath19 transforms according to the irreducible representation @xmath20 of the gauge group @xmath21 .",
    "the one - loop @xmath9-function of the gauge coupling @xmath13 is given by ^(1)_g&= & = [ _ il(r_i)-3c_2(g ) ]  , [ betag ] where @xmath22 is the dynkin index of @xmath20 and @xmath23 is the quadratic casimir of the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath9-functions of @xmath18 , by virtue of the non - renormalization theorem , are related to the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath24 of the matter fields @xmath19 as : _",
    "c^ijk = c^ijk = c^ijp _ n=1_p^k(n ) + ( k i ) + ( kj )  .",
    "[ betay ] at one - loop level @xmath24 is given by _",
    "i^j(1)=c_ipqc^jpq-2g^2c_2(r_i)_i^j  , [ gamay ] where @xmath25 is the quadratic casimir of the representation @xmath20 , and @xmath26 .",
    "all the one - loop @xmath9-functions of the theory vanish if the @xmath9-function of the gauge coupling @xmath27 , and the anomalous dimensions @xmath28 , vanish , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dynkin index of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the quadratic casimir invariant of the adjoint representation of @xmath21 .",
    "a very interesting result is that the conditions ( [ zoup - fini ] ) are necessary and sufficient for finiteness at the two - loop level @xcite .",
    "the one- and two - loop finiteness conditions ( [ zoup - fini ] ) restrict considerably the possible choices of the irreducible representations @xmath31 for a given group @xmath21 as well as the yukawa couplings in the superpotential ( [ supot ] ) . note in particular that the finiteness conditions can not be applied to the supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) , since the presence of a @xmath33 gauge group is incompatible with the condition ( [ zoup - fini ] ) , due to @xmath34=0 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the expectation that finiteness should be attained at the grand unified level only , the ssm being just the corresponding low - energy , effective theory .",
    "the finiteness conditions impose relations between gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , we have to guarantee that such relations leading to a reduction of the couplings hold at any renormalization point .",
    "the necessary , but also sufficient , condition for this to happen is to require that such relations are solutions to the reduction equations ( res ) to all orders .",
    "the all - loop order finiteness theorem of ref.@xcite is based on : ( a ) the structure of the supercurrent in @xmath4 sym and on ( b ) the non - renormalization properties of @xmath4 chiral anomalies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , similar results can be obtained @xcite using an analysis of the all - loop nsvz gauge beta - function @xcite .",
    "the above described method of reducing the dimensionless couplings has been extended @xcite to the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) dimensionful parameters of @xmath4 supersymmetric theories . recently very interesting",

    "the powerful supergraph method @xcite for studying supersymmetric theories has been applied to the softly broken ones by using the `` spurion '' external space - time independent superfields @xcite . in the latter method",
    "a softly broken supersymmetric gauge theory is considered as a supersymmetric one in which the various parameters such as couplings and masses have been promoted to external superfields that acquire `` vacuum expectation values '' . based on this method the relations among the soft term renormalization and",
    "that of an unbroken supersymmetric theory have been derived .",
    "in particular the @xmath9-functions of the parameters of the softly broken theory are expressed in terms of partial differential operators involving the dimensionless parameters of the unbroken theory . the key point in the strategy of refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite in solving the set of coupled differential equations so as to be able to express all parameters in a rgi way , was to transform the partial differential operators involved to total derivative operators @xcite .",
    "it is indeed possible to do this on the rgi surface which is defined by the solution of the reduction equations .",
    "in addition it was found that rgi ssb scalar masses in gauge - yukawa unified models satisfy a universal sum rule at one - loop @xcite .",
    "this result was generalized to two - loops for finite theories @xcite , and then to all - loops for general gauge - yukawa and finite unified theories @xcite .    in order to obtain a feeling of some of the above results , consider the superpotential given by ( 1 ) along with the lagrangian for ssb terms @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are the scalar parts of the chiral superfields @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the gauginos and @xmath39 their unified mass . since only finite theories are considered here , it is assumed that the gauge group is a simple group and the one - loop @xmath9-function of the gauge coupling @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "it is also assumed that the reduction equations admit power series solutions of the form c^ijk = g_n=0^ijk_(n ) g^2n  . according to the finiteness theorem @xcite , the theory is then finite to all - orders in perturbation theory , if , among others , the one - loop anomalous dimensions @xmath40 vanish",

    "<S> finite unified theories ( futs ) are n=1 supersymmetric grand unified theories , which can be made all - loop finite , both in the dimensionless ( gauge and yukawa couplings ) and dimensionful ( soft supersymmetry breaking terms ) sectors . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable property provides a drastic reduction in the number of free parameters , which in turn leads to an accurate prediction of the top quark mass in the dimensionless sector , and predictions for the higgs boson mass and the supersymmetric spectrum in the dimensionful sector . </S>",
    "<S> here we examine the predictions of two futs taking into account a number of theoretical and experimental constraints . for the first one we present the results of a detailed scanning concerning the higgs mass prediction , while for the second we present a representative prediction of its spectrum .    * finite unified theories and the higgs mass prediction * + abdelhak djouadi@xmath0 , sven heinemeyer@xmath1 , myriam mondragn@xmath2 + and george zoupanos@xmath3 +   @xmath0laboratoire de physique mathmatique et thorique , + universit de montpellier ii , france + ` abdelhak.djouadi@cern.ch ` + @xmath1 dept . of physics , cern , </S>",
