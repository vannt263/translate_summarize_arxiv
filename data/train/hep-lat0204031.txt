    "coleman suggested a perturbative approach to the understanding of the equivalence between the sine  gordon and the thirring model .",
    "he developed a perturbation theory with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath4 in order to compare the @xmath14point green functions in the sine - gordon and the massive thirring model in coordinate representation . under the assumption of the existence of these two theories ,",
    "coleman concluded that they should be equivalent if the coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath5 obey the relation @xcite @xmath16 and the operators @xmath2 and @xmath0 satisfy the abelian bosonisation rules @xmath17 where the constant @xmath18 depends on the regularisation @xcite .",
    "the common point of all approaches to the solution of the massless thirring model @xcite@xcite and to the derivation of the equivalence between the sine - gordon and the massive thirring model @xcite is a quantisation of the fermionic system around the trivial perturbative vacuum .",

    "( [ courel ] ) the creation of non  perturbative solitons is energetically preferable with respect to the creation of bosons .",
    "the bosons are decoupled from the system and there exist practically only solitons .",
    "the topological current of the sine - gordon model coincides with the noether current of the massive thirring model related to the @xmath35 invariance @xcite , responsible for the conservation of the fermion number in the massive thirring model , the topological charge of the sine - gordon model has the meaning of the fermion number . since many ",
    "soliton solutions obey pauli s exclusion principle , this should prove skyrme s statement @xcite that the sine - gordon model solitons can be interpreted as massive fermions .",
    "thus , via spontaneously broken chiral symmetry the massive thirring fermions get converted into extended particles with the properties of fermions and masses much heavier than their initial mass .",
    "we will now show that spontaneous symmetry breaking in four dimensions may also lead to stable solitons of finite mass , to extended particles , which at large distances behave like dual dirac monopoles , like electrical charged particles @xcite whose interaction originates in their topology .",
    "the dirac string can be dissolved by a transition from a description with a dual u(1 ) gauge field @xmath36 to a field of unit vectors @xmath37 in the form of a hedgehog @xmath38 see fig .",
    "[ colouredhedgehog ] .",
    "this @xmath39-field has a singularity at the origin and two degrees of freedom which can be identified with the two degrees of freedom of the electro - magnetic field in the vacuum . since no magnetic monopoles have been found until now we prefer the interpretation of dirac monopoles as electrically charged particles .",
    "the @xmath39 representation of the dirac monopole is equivalent to the original description in terms of the gauge field @xcite and makes it evident how one can dissolve the singularity at the origin . removing the condition @xmath41 by multiplying @xmath39 with a factor @xmath42 and reducing the length of the vectors in the centre to zero ( @xmath43 ) the hedgehog field can be regularised .",
    "this corresponds to a transition to a field of unimodular quaternions , to an su(2)-field @xmath44 where the fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 depend on the position @xmath47 in minkowski space - time and @xmath48 are the pauli matrices . or @xmath49 and @xmath50 . ]",
    "we can now introduce the lagrangian of dual su(2)-qcd by a geometrical concept . as suggested by gauge - theories",
    ", we would like to interpret the field strength as internal curvature in colour space , in the parameter space @xmath51 of su(2 ) .",
    "this can be done via the definition of a connection @xmath52 between local internal coordinate systems . using @xmath53 as basis vectors of the tangential space at @xmath54",
    "we define the connection field as the tangential vector @xmath55 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 @xmath58 the relation between the dual gauge field and the connection is implied by the transition to the si  system .",
    "the connection field @xmath59 looks only superficially like a pure gauge field which would lead to the rather unnatural definition of curvature zero for the unit sphere @xmath51 and to field strength zero .",
    "the above definition ( [ dualgaugefield ] ) differs from the pure gauge definition by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "the electric flux through a rectangle in configuration space is given by the corresponding area in the tangential plane of @xmath51 .",
    "this suggests to identify the dual field strength tensor with the curvature tensor @xmath61 @xmath62 the connection field @xmath55 obeys the maurer - cartan equation@xcite @xmath63 the curvature tensor can therefore be represented in a form which is well known from non - abelian gauge theories @xmath64 in those theories the gauge field @xmath55 is the basic field and ca nt be derived from a soliton field .",
    "it is well  known from qcd that a lagrangean which contains the square of the curvature only dissolves monopoles .",
    "therefore we supplement the lagrangean of dual qcd by a compressing higgs - potential , a function of tr@xmath65 with the minimum at @xmath66 and monotonically increasing with @xmath67 allowing for spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath68 with sommerfeld s fine  structure constant @xmath69 .",
    "as long as the above mentioned general requirements for the potential are fulfilled the special choice of the potential does influence the properties of the soliton core only , i.e.  the high energy properties . for the potential @xmath74 there exists an analytical solution @xmath75 which results in the energy for a single soliton @xmath76 comparing this expression with the rest energy of the electron of 0.511 mev , one gets @xmath77 fm , a value close to the classical electron radius of @xmath78 fm .",
    "there are three contributions to the radial energy density , the expression in the square braces in @xmath79,\\ ] ] two contributions from the electric field and one from the potential energy .",
    "the contribution of the colour component of the electric field in the direction of @xmath39 , the `` radial field '' decreases with @xmath80 and has the largest range . at large distances",
    "it provides the classical coulomb field of a point  like charge .",
    "it reaches its maximum at @xmath81 and decreases in the centre due to the shrinking of the spherical volume .",
    "the nasty divergence of the classical coulomb field is obviously removed .",

    "a restriction of the fields to @xmath84 , to those at the minimum of the potential @xmath83 , leads to maxwell s electrodynamics in a dual formulation @xcite . in this `` electrodynamic limit ''",
    "the soliton field degenerates to @xmath85 and can be characterised by the space - time dependence of an @xmath86field , the unit vector field @xmath39 .",
    "the two degrees of freedom of @xmath39 provide the two polarisations of the free electromagnetic field .",
    "connection field and curvature get very simple expressions , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and the gauge symmetry of electrodynamics has a very intuitive geometrical interpretation .",
    "the vectors @xmath89 , in the tangential plane of the equatorial @xmath90 attributed to @xmath91 , define a local coordinate system for the connection fields @xmath52 at @xmath91 .",
    "a @xmath92 rotation of this local coordinate system around @xmath39 corresponds to the well known @xmath92 gauge symmetry of maxwell s electrodynamics . by a further rotation of these @xmath39 vectors in @xmath93",
    "direction @xcite one arrives at the dual formulation of electrodynamics , discussed in @xcite .",
    "this transition to the abelian description is like combing a sphere and attaches line - like singularities to the point  like singularities of the hedgehogs , one gets the well  known dirac  strings @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that also in 31 dimensions a model with spontaneous symmetry breaking may lead to solitons of finite mass .",
    "these solitons have quantised charges following from their topology and particle  antiparticle annihilation , already at the classical level . with only three degrees of freedom",
    "this model describes the phenomena of the free maxwell field , charged particles and their interaction via the maxwell field .",
    "the only difference to maxwell s electrodynamics is in the fact that the charges in maxwell s electrodynamics can be arbitrary . in the mentioned model",
    "only multiples of the elementary charge are allowed and this should not be a disadvantage as it agrees with experiment .",
    "this holds also true for magnetic monopoles , objects that are unstable in this model .",
