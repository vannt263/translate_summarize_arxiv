    "there currently exist several observations which indicate a potential violation of the cosmological principle which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large distance scales .",
    "one such observation is the hemispherical power asymmetry .",
    "@xcite in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) which has generated considerable interest in recent years .",
    "parametrization of hemispherical anisotropy of cmbr temperature field can be obtained by the dipole modulation model @xcite of the following form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an isotropic field , @xmath4 the preferred direction and @xmath5 amplitude of dipole modulation .",
    "both wmap and planck @xcite data confirm this asymmetry signal with high significance .",
    "this effect is absent at high-@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the dipole amplitude @xmath5 and the direction as observed in the wmap five year data are @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively @xcite .",
    "the planck observations are consistent with this result . in order to explain the observed large scale anisotropy",
    "many theoretical models have been proposed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the possibility that the dipole modulation might be related to the primordial power spectrum .",
    "a fascinating possibility is that it might be related to the early inhomogeneous or anisotropic phase of the expansion of the universe .",
    "such a phase is perfectly consistent with the big bang paradigm which postulates that the universe acquires isotropy during inflation .",
    "this phenomenon has been explicitly demonstrated with in the framework of the anisotropic bianchi models @xcite .",
    "it has been found that most of these models become isotropic very quickly during inflation .",
    "it has been suggested that the anisotropic modes , generated during this early phase may later re - enter the horizon @xcite and lead to observed signals of anisotropy .",
    "these modes will primarily affect the low @xmath0 multipoles of the cmbr and hence are consistent with the observations .",
    "we consider an inhomogeneous and , independently , an anisotropic model of the primordial power spectrum .",
    "we assume a simple parametrization of the power spectrum in these models .",
    "we expect that such a form may be related to a fundamental model which might involve an inhomogeneous metric or noncommutative space time or some other model of physics at very high energy scale .",
    "here we use the fact that the observed anisotropy is a small effect and hence we only need to keep its contribution at leading order .",
    "we assume a simple functional form of the @xmath8 dependence of this contribution and extract the parameters of this function by making a fit to the temperature data .",
    "these parameters are then used to predict the anisotropy in polarization data . in particular",
    "we focus on the ee and te correlations .",
    "the power spectrum is assumed to be generated by a scalar inflaton field .",
    "since such a field does not generate b modes , we do nt consider correlations involving these modes .",
    "the signature of hemispherical anisotropy in cmbr polarization power spectrum has been considered earlier in @xcite .",
    "however our emphasis and results are different .",
    "in particular we relate the observed anisotropy in temperature data to a primordial power spectrum and use the resulting power in order to predict the the signature in cmbr polarization .",
    "these results are so far not available in literature .",
    "we next clarify that if we assume homogeneity then it is not possible to generate a dipolar power spectrum required for an explanation of the hemispherical anisotropy within the standard framework of commutative space - time .",
    "however there are indications that such a power spectrum may be obtained within a non - commutative space - time @xcite . here",
    "we shall not be concerned with the theoretical subtleties in the calculation of this power spectrum and its relationship with the observed cmbr correlations .",
    "these issues are partially addressed in @xcite .",
    "however considerable more work is required before this framework can be properly understood . in any case",
    "the inhomogeneous model provides a theoretically sound description of the observed hemispherical anisotropy .",
    "hence we expect our results for the case of an inhomogeneous model to be very reliable .",
    "the cmbr temperature fluctuation and polarizations are fields on a sphere , so they can be decomposed in spherical harmonics @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the spherical harmonic coefficients and @xmath12 is the index denoting temperature ( t ) or e - mode polarization ( e ) . in terms of primordial density perturbation @xmath13 ,",
    "they are defined by the equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the present conformal time , @xmath16 is the mean cmbr temperature and @xmath17 is the standard transfer function employed in camb . using the standard notation @xcite , it can be written as , @xmath18    the two point correlation function in the presence of dipole modulation term in the temperature field can be written as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "here @xmath21 is the isotropic angular power spectrum and the second term on right is the contribution because of the dipole modulation term in the temperature field .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the dipole modulation leads to a correlation between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multipoles of the temperature field .    using eq .",

    "i.e. the primordial power spectrum @xmath23 . in this paper ,",
    "our primary objective is to consider an inhomogeneous primordial power spectrum model and an anisotropic one which would give @xmath0 and @xmath1 correlation explaining the hemispherical anisotropy . in real space , the two point correlation function of the density fluctuations @xmath24 can be expressed as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "next we give details about the two models .",

    "the first term on the right is the standard isotropic and homogeneous two point correlator .",

    "the amplitude of inhomogeneity is parametrized by @xmath37 .",
    "we expect the absolute magnitude of @xmath37 to be small .",
    "furthermore we expect this term to only show mild oscillations and , hence , the absolute magnitude of @xmath38 should not be large compared to unity .",
    "this model differs somewhat from that proposed in @xcite where the authors expanded the inhomogeneous term in powers of @xmath39 and kept only the leading order term .",

    "we use the high resolution wamp - ilc 9 year @xcite and planck s smica @xcite data . for masking the galactic portion we use kq85 for ilc and cmb - union mask for smica .",

    "the contribution due to detector noise is also included while generating the random map .",
    "however contribution due to noise is nt included for the case of smica , since the corresponding noise files are too bulky . for multipole range @xmath90 the detector noise gives a relatively small contribution @xcite .",
    "hence the error induced by neglecting the noise contribution in the case of planck data in the above range is expected to be small .",

    "the standard deviation of @xmath91 over these 1000 maps gives an estimate of the error in the statistic .",

    "furthermore the anisotropic model ( fig [ fig : anisotropic_part1 ] ) shows a more pronounced trend which is opposite to what is seen for the case of inhomogeneous model . in this case",
