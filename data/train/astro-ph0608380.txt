    "the standard picture of agn emission  which identifies the engines as accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs)is now well established . also well established is the hierarchical paradigm for structure formation , in which massive galaxies grow via a series of mergers of smaller objects .",
    "an obvious consequence of this picture is that some galaxies should contain two smbhs in their centers .",
    "such nuclear bh pairs will initially be widely separated ( @xmath7 kpc ) `` dual '' smbhs .",
    "after @xmath8 myr they will become true _ binary _ smbhs , gravitationally bound to one another and with parsec - scale separations ; they may finally coalesce into a single central smbh on much longer timescales  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of smbh binaries has significant implications for the formation of galactic cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and their coalescence may be a significant source of gravitational radiation in the universe ; this subject has received much theoretical study ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "observational study of these objects has been far more limited , however : only recently has direct detection of a true binary smbh been reported , in the liner - like elliptical radio galaxy 0402 + 379 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is only one unambiguous detection of a dual agn in a single galaxy , from _ chandra _ studies of the merger remnant ngc 6240 @xcite , although there are several examples of merging pairs of agn hosts ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , and there is a population of close quasar pairs that are very unlikely to be lensed objects ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "most of the merger examples were discovered in studies of merging late - type galaxies with significantly disturbed morphologies .",
    "recent work on galaxy evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) implies that significant stellar mass in elliptical galaxies is built up in dissipationless mergers of early - type progenitors .",
    "the remnants of such mergers exhibit only subtle visual signatures @xcite , suggesting that dual - smbh systems should also occur in apparently normal early - types .",
    "the extended groth strip is a subregion of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey that is also the site of intense , multiwavelength observational efforts by the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) team .",
    "full details of the dataset can be found in @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we present evidence from aegis for a dual agn at @xmath0 in the @xmath9 early - type galaxy egsd2 j142033.66 + 525917.5 the object was identified serendipitously in the process of visually inspecting deep2 spectra to confirm galaxy redshifts . throughout this work",
    "we adopt a flat , @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 and @xmath2 ; all distances are quoted in physical ( not comoving ) units .",
    "and h@xmath4 emission .",
    "each [ ] line has two clear emission components separated by @xmath12 in velocity . for clarity ,",
    "the h@xmath4 emission is shown on a magnified vertical scale in the inset ; it is affected by noise from a night sky line . ]",
    "[ fig:1dspec ] shows part of the one - dimensional deep2 spectrum of this object , obtained using the deimos spectrograph on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the most notable features of the spectrum are a pair of strong , double - peaked emission lines , readily identifiable by their wavelength ratios as [ ] @xmath134959 and @xmath135007 .",
    "the two peaks of the @xmath135007 line are separated by @xmath14  in wavelength .",
    "the spectrum also has h@xmath4 emission , which may be double - peaked but is partially obscured by residual night - sky poisson noise ; there are no other emission lines , but the spectrum displays a numerous stellar continuum absorption features over the entire observed wavelength range ( 67508890 ) , most of which is not shown here .",
    "[ fig:2dspec ] shows the sky - subtracted two - dimensional deimos spectrum of this object in the regions around each of the emission lines seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dspec ] .",
    "the spectrum exhibits two _ spatially offset _ emission components : their ( one - dimensional ) spatial centroids ( which can be measured independently to an accuracy of @xmath15 pixels ) are separated by 1.5 deimos pixels , or @xmath16 on the sky .",
    "the two components spatial extents are consistent with the @xmath17 seeing on the night of observation ; they are not extended sources .    because the emission lines in this spectrum have significant velocity structure , we determined the systemic redshift of the galaxy by fitting synthetic spectral templates to the galaxy s stellar continuum emission , whose absorption features do not exhibit such structure .",
    "following @xcite , we use the stellar population synthesis code of @xcite to create two templates , representing an old ( 7 gyr ) population and a young ( 0.3 gyr ) population , both with solar metallicity .",
    "we then find the redshift and the linear combination of these templates that best fit the observed spectrum , excluding wide windows around the h@xmath4 and [ ] lines . only the old - population template proved necessary for a good fit .",
    "this procedure yields a redshift of @xmath0 for the host galaxy .",
    "the k - correction algorithm of @xcite then gives an absolute magnitude @xmath1 ( ab ) and a rest - frame color @xmath3among the reddest in deep2 , though typical of agn @xcite .",
    "we have shifted the wavelength scale of fig .",
    "[ fig:1dspec ] to the rest frame of the host ; the expected wavelengths of the emission lines are shown by vertical dashed lines .",
    "the two emission peaks are located almost symmetrically with respect to the host galaxy in velocity space . in the host",
    "s rest frame , their velocity separation is @xmath5 and their projected physical separation is @xmath6 kpc .    having fit the stellar continuum , we may subtract off this emission and consider the properties of the emission lines alone .",
    "first , the two emission - line components have strongly asymmetric profiles .",
    "the emission lines seen in fig .  [ fig:1dspec ] are not well described by the sum of two gaussian curves ; there is significant emission bridging the two peaks .",
    "we therefore fit the spectrum with _ three _ gaussians by iteratively fitting and subtracting first the blueward peak , then the redward , then the bridging emission .",
    "this yields velocity dispersion measurements of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the blueward and redward emission components , respectively .",
    "the bridging emission is too uniformly distributed in wavelength to be particularly well described a gaussian , but its nominal dispersion is @xmath20 , and its peak is consistent with zero velocity offset .",
    "the ratio of the [ ] @xmath21 and h@xmath4 line fluxes is commonly used to distinguish seyfert galaxies from other emission - line galaxies , with seyferts having @xmath21/h@xmath22 in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; this criterion remains valid for red galaxies at @xmath23 ( r.  yan et al . in prep . ) .",
    "we have measured the ratios for the two emission components in this red galaxy by summing the 1-d spectrum over the measured @xmath24 velocity width of each peak .",
    "this procedure gives ratios of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the blueward and redward component , respectively , placing both firmly in the seyfert category .",
    "we now turn to multiwavelength imaging from the aegis collaboration . of the available imaging data ,",
    "hst_/acs images have the potential to resolve the two emission regions ; we show acs imaging in the f606w and f814w ( hereafter @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : hst ] . also shown",
    "are the positions of the deimos slit edges and the positions along the slit of the emission components seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dspec ] .",
    "the @xmath28 band image shows an early - type , spheroidal galaxy with a smooth profile , but the image also exhibits subtle asymmetry , with a nucleus that is slightly off - center compared to the outer envelope ; this may indicate recent merger activity .",
    "the @xmath27 band image is less smooth and more obviously asymmetric .",
    "it also shows an interesting horseshoe - shaped structure near its center on a similar angular scale as the galaxy s two emission - line components ; this structure might be related to the emission regions .",
    "we have run the galfit galaxy image modeling code @xcite on the acs images , and we find that both radial profiles are described well by a @xcite profile , with index n=2.14 for the @xmath28 band and n=1.7 for the @xmath27 band .",
    "the images central concentrations are thus near the low end of the elliptical range . also , the morphological parameters computed by @xcite for the acs imaging are consistent with expectations for bulge - dominated galaxies , but with a significantly lower concentration and higher degree of substructure than are typical for such objects .",
    "these results support the picture of an early - type galaxy with a double nucleus .",
    "m flux ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the dashed line ( visible at center ) shows the sum of the dust and stellar models . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] , we compile a rest - frame sed from aegis observations .",
    "the object is detected at @xmath29 significance in _ chandra_/acis imaging , ground - based @xmath30 photometry from cfht and palomar , all four _ spitzer _ irac bands , the _ spitzer _",
    "mips 24 @xmath31 m band , and at 21 cm with the vla .",
    "we also show @xmath32 upper limits on the flux in the _ galex _ bands and at 6 cm .",
    "the measured sed is well described by the simple model of an early - type galaxy with a central , dust - obscured agn .",
    "plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] is a synthetic sed , produced using the code of @xcite , representing a galaxy with an old ( 7 gyr ) , dust - free stellar population that formed in a single 500 myr burst ; it has been normalized to the measured k band flux of the host galaxy , and no further fitting has been done in the figure . to obtain more precision ,",
    "we have applied the sed template - fitting procedure of @xcite to the @xmath30 fluxes alone : this galaxy has a 7-gyr - old stellar population with a stellar metallicity @xmath33 times solar , a stellar mass of @xmath34 , a star formation rate of @xmath35 } = -0.97\\pm 0.35 $ ] and a @xmath27 band dust extinction of @xmath36 mag . also plotted in the figure is a simple model of the emission from a dust - obscured agn , normalized to the 24 @xmath31 m flux , to illustrate that dust can account for the mips flux without contributing significant emission at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the curve was produced using the publicly available dusty code for radiative transfer through dust @xcite , with a simple hot - dust model after @xcite , and an input spectrum given by the mean sed for radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "observation is also consistent with an obscured agn : of nine photons detected from this source seven are in the hard ( 27 kev ) x - ray band , indicating that the soft ( 0.52 kev ) x - ray emission has been absorbed .",
    "assuming an intrinsic x - ray spectrum @xmath37 , the x - ray data imply an absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity of @xmath38 erg s@xmath39 in the rest - frame 210 kev band .",
    "similarly , assuming a radio spectrum @xmath40 , the 21 cm emission translates into a rest - frame 1.4 ghz luminosity of @xmath41ergs@xmath39hz@xmath39 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "these observations represent strong evidence for a dual agn hosted by an early - type galaxy . the [ ] @xmath21/h@xmath4 emission - line ratio of the galaxy is iron - clad evidence for an agn ; this is further supported by the x - ray detection . the conclusion that there are in fact _",
    "two _ accreting smbhs in this galaxy is driven entirely by the deep2 spectroscopic data .",
    "double peaked emission lines like those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dspec ] could be explained by three reasonable models : a rotating disk , an outflow ( or inflow ) , or a pair of orbiting emission components .",
    "a reasonable disk model , however , can not easily accommodate emission regions separated by @xmath6 kpc and @xmath5 .",
    "typical accretion disks around smbhs are smaller by several orders of magnitude and have relativistic velocities ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) ; it is difficult to understand how a larger disk could exhibit its brightest agn - like emission at distances @xmath42 kpc from the smbh . on the other hand ,",
    "outflows of gas and dust are commonly invoked to explain asymmetric [ ] emission from narrow - line agn ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "these asymmetries , however , typically take the form of broad , blue wings , not strong second peaks , and in this picture we would expect one emission component to be at rest at the host galaxy s center , unlike what is observed here",
    ". there do exist , in a few nearby seyferts , bipolar outflows that have spatial scales , bulk velocities , and emission - line ratios that could explain our observations ( _ e.g. _ , ) , but these systems are quite kinematically disturbed , with emission components whose velocity dispersions are comparable to their velocity separations .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the relatively narrow emission - line components in this object .",
    "we thus regard a dual smbh as the likeliest explanation for our observations .",
    "the identification is quite consistent with theoretical expectations and with previous observations . as discussed in the introduction , dual smbhs",
    "are expected to remain separated at @xmath7 kpc for @xmath8 myr after a galaxy merger and then rapidly form a parsec - scale binary indeed , like this one , the previously observed dual agn in ngc 6240 @xcite has a separation @xmath42 kpc . unlike this one , that galaxy also shows strong signatures of recent merger activity , but since such signatures are quite subtle in dissipationless mergers , they will not be as obvious in our imaging . however , the identification of a dual agn in this galaxy is not as secure as in ngc 6240 , where _",
    "chandra _ can resolve two x - ray sources in the galaxies centers ; the angular scale of interest here ( @xmath16 ) is simply too small to be resolved in our observations .",
    "nevertheless , assuming our interpretation is correct , it is possible to infer further information about the two smbhs .",
    "first , they are clearly bound within the galaxy , since their peculiar velocities ( @xmath43 ) are much smaller than the escape velocity ( @xmath44 ) implied by the host galaxy s measured stellar mass .",
    "second , our observations permit an estimate of the smbh masses .",
    "@xcite show that , in nearby agn , the width of the [ ] emission lines is a reasonable proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy bulge , @xmath45 , provided that any asymmetric wings are removed .",
    "our line - fitting procedure accounts for all obvious asymmetries , so we may use the measured linewidths to infer smbh masses from the @xmath46-@xmath45 relation ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "this relation implies @xmath47 for the blueward component and @xmath48 for the redward one . by comparison",
    ", the relation between bulge mass and smbh mass ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) implies that this @xmath49 galaxy should harbor a bh of mass @xmath50 , more than an order of magnitude larger than the total bh mass we infer .",
    "the discrepancy is only at the @xmath51 level , however , given the large scatter in the relations discussed here .",
    "simple considerations might lead one to expect that dual smbhs reside in a relatively large fraction of galaxies : if a typical galaxy undergoes a major merger every few gyr , and the resulting dual smbh has a lifetime of @xmath52 myr , then a few percent of all galaxies  say @xmath53 of the @xmath54 galaxies in deep2should host such systems .",
    "the fact that we have found only one dual agn in deep2 is not inconsistent with this estimate .",
    "first , it is not clear that _ every _ dual smbh will exhibit agn activity for its full lifetime , especially from both nuclei at once . even if so",
    ", clean detection of double - peaked agn emission lines is easiest if the bright , narrow [ ] emission lines fall in the deep2 wavelength range ; this is true for only @xmath55 of the deep2 sample .",
    "also , dual agn that occur in late - type galaxies may have the bulk of their optical emission obscured by dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so we can expect objects with observational signatures like this one to occur mostly in early - type systems .",
    "these constitute only @xmath56% of the deep2 sample .",
    "thus we would expect deep2 to have only a few dozen objects like the one studied here if all such objects are active .",
    "this dual agn was discovered serendipitously ; a comprehensive search of the deep2 catalog might find more .",
    "we close by addressing the relatively weak emission bridging the two emission components in figs .",
    "[ fig:1dspec ] and  [ fig:2dspec ] .",
    "as already mentioned , narrow [ ] lines in agn spectra frequently exhibit asymmetric blue wings , probably from outflows ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "if such an outflow is present for the redward agn here , it could explain the bridging emission .",
    "given the unusual nature of this galaxy s spectrum , however , this explanation is by no means certain",
    ". infrared imaging and integral - field unit observations on an 8-meter class telescope with adaptive optics , or narrow - band imaging of the [ ] line from space , could help to further characterize this emission and the system as a whole .",
