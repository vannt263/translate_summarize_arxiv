    "the @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratio is an important measure of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis .",
    "current theoretical models of stellar evolution on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) predict that stars with `` normal '' chemical composition transform into carbon stars , from spectral type m via the intermediate states ms , s and sc , through the dredge - up of freshly synthesized carbon in he - shell flashes ( busso et al .",
    "this scenario is also confirmed by observations ( smith & lambert 1985 , 1990 ; dominy et  al.1986 ; lambert et  al .",
    "since mainly the @xmath1c - isotope is synthesized , there should be a coeval evolution in the @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratio from the value determined during the first red giant evolution .",
    "in addition , processes like hot bottom burning will affect this ratio ( boothroyd et  al.1993 ) , as well as set an upper mass limit for carbon stars .",
    "thus , an accurate estimate of the @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratio should increase our understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of carbon stars ( e.g. , forestini & charbonnel 1997 ; wallerstein & knapp 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratio is also an important tracer of the past starformation rate and stellar mass function ( prantzos et  al .",
    "1996 ; greaves & holland 1997 ) .    in a classical paper , lambert",
    "@xcite determined the photospheric @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios of 30 optically bright carbon stars , by fitting stellar atmosphere models to near - ir data on the isotopomers of c@xmath2 , co , and cn .",
    "a decade later ohnaka & tsuji ( 1996 , 1999 ) , based on a different method and data on the cn red system around 8000 , presented @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios that , on the average , are about a factor of two lower than those of lambert et  al .",
    "@xcite for the same stars .",
    "the activity in this field was further increased with the published results of abia & isern @xcite .",
    "they derived @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios of 44 carbon stars , using the cn red system , which fell in between the results obtained by lambert et  al .",
    "@xcite and ohnaka & tsuji @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since they used the same model atmospheres as lambert et  al .",
    "@xcite , suggesting that the derived @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios depend on the spectral features used .",
    "it is difficult to identify the main reason for the different results obtained by lambert et  al .",
    "@xcite and ohnaka & tsuji ( 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "the former used high - resolution near - infrared data , while the latter used data obtained closer to optical wavelengths . also the atmospheric models differ .",
    "de  laverny & gustafsson @xcite have investigated the method used by ohnaka & tsuji @xcite and found that it is very sensitive to model parameters and blends .",
    "their conclusion is that the larger @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios determined by lambert et  al .",
    "@xcite are more reliable , since this analysis is rather insensitive to the adopted model parameters , and also the effect of blends is less severe , but the discussion continues ( ohnaka & tsuji 1998 ; de laverny & gustafsson 1999 ) .",
    "recently , ohnaka et  al .",
    "@xcite have revised the values for three of the stars , which were originally published in ohnaka & tsuji @xcite . using new model atmospheres ,",
    "they obtain @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios that are larger by about 40% , i.e. , closer to those estimated by lambert et  al .",
    "@xcite .    to shed light on this disturbing controversy",
    ", we have performed independent estimates of the @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratio , using co radio line emission from the circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) , for a sample of carbon stars showing large discrepancies between the sets of photospheric estimates . due to the weakness of the circumstellar @xmath0co lines , and the difficulties in the interpretation of the circumstellar emission",
    ", only a few attempts have been made to determine the @xmath1co/@xmath0co ratio in the cses of carbon stars ( e.g. , knapp & chang 1985 ; sopka et  al .",
    "1989 ; greaves & holland 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we present new observational results , as well as a detailed modelling of circumstellar @xmath1co and @xmath0co radio line emission .",
    "we have selected a sample of 11 optically bright carbon stars for which the photospheric @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios have been determined by lambert et  al .",

    "as for the @xmath1co modelling , this is illustrated for two of our sample stars , ( fig .",
    "[ cwleo ] ) and ( fig .  [ uhya ] ) .",
    "the abundance of @xmath0co is usually ( the j - stars provide an exception ) much smaller than that of @xmath1co , which leads to significantly different excitation conditions for the rarer isotopomer .",
    "for instance , the model @xmath0co line intensities are more sensitive to the assumed properties of the central source of emission , since radiative pumping via the first excited vibrational state becomes important .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0co @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 and @xmath4@xmath5@xmath9@xmath7@xmath6 transitions have inverted populations over parts of the envelope even for a high mass loss rate object as , fig .",

    "changing the inner radius of the cse or the luminosity of the star by @xmath350% will change the estimated @xmath0co abundance by @xmath320% .    in our modelling of the @xmath0co line emission we have assumed that the @xmath0co envelope size is equal to that of @xmath1co .",
    "this is based upon the model results by mamon et  al .",
    "@xcite . in this model both",
    "the effects of photodissociation and of chemical fractionation were included .",
    "chemical fractionation of co occurs through the exchange reaction ( watson et al .  1976 )",

    "below this temperature , the backward reaction is suppressed and production of @xmath0co from @xmath1co is favoured .",
    "this reaction can effectively produce @xmath0co in the outer , cool parts of circumstellar envelopes .",
    "mamon et  al .",
    "@xcite concluded that the difference between the @xmath1co and @xmath0co abundance distributions , when tested over a large mass loss rate interval , is always small , no more than 10 to 20% . without the effect of chemical fractionation",
    "the @xmath0co envelope would be significantly smaller .",
    "this is due to the fact that co is photodissociated in lines and thereby exhibits considerable self - shielding .",
    "thus , the shielding is higher the higher the optical depth , and hence it is less efficient for the less abundant @xmath0co . using oso we have obtained a brightness distribution map of the @xmath0co(@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 ) emission around . it is found that the model , with an assumed @xmath0co envelope size equal to that of @xmath1co , reproduces the observed radial brightness distribution within the observational errors , fig .  [ cwleo ] .",
    "a 20% smaller @xmath0co envelope gives the same @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratio but fails to reproduce the observed radial brightness distribution within the observational errors .",
    "this shows the importance of chemical fractionation , at least in the cool outer parts of dense cses . in the case of the thin molecular envelope around a 20% smaller @xmath0co envelope size",
    "would increase the derived @xmath0co abundance by about 20% .",
    "this illustrates that in the case of a thin cse the co molecules are effectively excited to the photodissociation radius , i.e. , photodissociation determines the size of the emitting region , whereas in a dense cse excitation sets the size of the emitting region .      in table",
    "[ coresult ] we list the observed integrated @xmath1co/@xmath0co line intensity ratios .",
    "they are corrected for the differences in line strengths and beam - filling factors ( assuming the sources to be unresolved the combined effect gives a @xmath61 correction , i.e. , the observed ratio is lowered by a factor of 0.87 ) .",
    "although we note that some of our cses are resolved , we have nevertheless treated all our sources in the same manner .",
    "here we have chosen to integrate the emission over the entire line in order to achieve better signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "for optically thin lines this ratio should provide a first order estimate of the abundance ratio . a narrow velocity interval centered on the systemic velocity , where optical depth effects are smallest ,",
    "should give somewhat higher line intensity ratios than those presented here .",
    "nine of our sample stars have been detected in the @xmath0co(@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 ) and/or the @xmath0co(@xmath4@xmath5@xmath9@xmath7@xmath6 ) line .",

    "[ input ] we present the @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratios derived using our radiative transfer code .",
    "they span a large range , from 2.5 to 90 ( steps of 5 in the @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratio was used to find the best fit @xmath0co model , except for the j - stars where a smaller step - size of 0.5 was used ) . for most of our observed stars",
    "the isotope ratio obtained from the detailed radiative transfer is higher than those estimated from simple line intensity ratios .",
    "the discrepancy is fairly small for the objects with thin cses , but it increases with the thickness of the cse ( @xmath3@xmath63/@xmath19 ) and reaches a factor of six for the high mass loss rate objects , fig .",

    "[ cwleo ] and for the low mass loss rate object in fig .",
    "the optical depth in the @xmath1co(@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 ) line is significantly lower .",
    "the estimated @xmath0co abundance depends on the adopted @xmath1co abundance ( assumed to be equal for all stars ) .",
    "we find that to a first approximation it scales with @xmath64 , since a lower ( higher ) @xmath64 leads to a higher ( lower ) mass loss rate to fit the @xmath1co line intensities and hence a lower ( higher ) @xmath0co abundance to fit the @xmath0co line intensities .",
    "this means that to a first approximation the estimated @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratios are only very weakly dependant on the adopted @xmath1co abundance .",
    "we have varied some of the other parameters in the model ( see above ) , and conclude that in doing so the derived @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratio changes by about 20% . with an additional uncertainty of @xmath1715% in the relative calibration of the @xmath1co and @xmath0co data",

    "@xcite estimated @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratios for four of our stars that are all lower than our derived values .",

    "we note here that our results suggest that the @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios in the detached shells ( with ages of about 10@xmath37 and 10@xmath66yr for and , respectively ) are the same as the present ones in the photospheres .",
    "taken at face values our derived @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratios support the @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios derived by lambert et  al .",
    "@xcite , fig  [ resplot ] .",
    "however , there are a number of uncertainties in the extrapolation from the circumstellar isotopomer result to the stellar isotope ratio . the properties of the co molecule suggests that the isotopomer ratio in the gas leaving the star is equal to the isotope ratio .",
    "we have based our circumstellar model upon the photodissociation / chemical fractionation results of mamon et  al .",
    "@xcite , and this has so far proven to give good results in our test cases .",
    "our radiative transfer calculations are detailed and also provide good fits to multi - transition data .",
    "we also believe that estimates of isotopomer ratios are far less dependant on the adopted circumstellar model than are individual abundances .",
    "the two molecules have essentially the same energy level diagrams , the same transition strengths , and the same collisional cross sections , and hence their relative abundances are much less dependant on the adopted model than their absolute abundances ( note that for @xmath1co we actually adopt an abundance ) .",
    "however , one should note that the circumstellar estimates apply to time scales of 10@xmath27 to 10@xmath37 years , but there is no reason to expect that these stars have changed their surface composition over such a short time scale . in conclusion , we believe that our derived @xmath1co/@xmath0co - ratios are reliable estimates of the stellar @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratios .",

    "this star could be a borderline case with a mass of about 3.5m@xmath67 , where the cno - cycle produces a low @xmath1c/@xmath0c - ratio , while the temperature is not high enough to effectively convert @xmath1c to @xmath51n ( ventura et  al .",
