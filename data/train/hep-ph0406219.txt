    "the linear @xmath0 @xmath1-model occupies a unique place in elementary particle physics and quantum field theory",
    ". introduced back in 1960 by gell - mann and levy,@xcite the model is at the heart of particle and nuclear dynamics at very different scales . at the scale of order 10 mev ,",
    "the model with sigma , pion and nucleon fields is relevant for nuclear structure calculations .",
    "then , at the scale of order 100 mev , the model with nucleon fields replaced by quark ones , is an effective theory of chiral dynamics of hadrons ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "and at the scale of order 100 gev , the model is nothing else but the higgs sector of the electroweak theory .    in this brief review",
    ", we will describe new and quite surprising phenomena taking place in the linear @xmath0 @xmath1-model at finite density or , more precisely , at the finite chemical potential @xmath2 for the hypercharge @xmath3 .",
    "the interest to this model is connected with that it is a toy model for the description of the dynamics of the kaon condensate@xcite in the color - flavor locked phase@xcite of high density qcd that may exist in cores of compact stars .",
    "we will consider dynamics at finite @xmath2 both in the linear @xmath1-model itself@xcite and in its gauged version , when the subgroup @xmath4 is being gauged.@xcite the central results are as follows :    1 .",
    "in the ungauged @xmath1-model , the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath5 symmetry , caused by the chemical potential , leads to a lesser number of nambu - goldstone bosons than that required by the goldstone theorem .",
    "one of the consequences of this phenomenon is that the system is not a superfluid despite the presence of a condensate .",
    "2 .   in the gauged version of the model , the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath5 symmetry , caused by the chemical potential , is always accompanied by spontaneous breakdown of both rotational symmetry and electromagnetic @xmath6 .",
    "the spectrum of excitations in the gauged model is very rich . in particular , there exist excitation branches that behave as phonon - like quasiparticles for small momenta and as roton - like ones for large momenta .",
    "these roton - like excitations are present because of gauge vector fields .",
    "this can shed light on microscopic nature of roton - like excitations , which is an old problem in the theory of superfluidity.@xcite it also suggests that this model can be relevant for superfluid and superconducting systems .",
    "recently a class of relativistic models with a finite density of matter has been revealed in which spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries leads to a lesser number of nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons than that required by the goldstone theorem.@xcite the simplest representative of this class is the linear @xmath0 @xmath1-model with the chemical potential for the hypercharge @xmath3 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a complex doublet field .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath2 is provided by external conditions ( to be specific , we take @xmath9 ) .",
    "for example , in the case of dense qcd with the kaon condensate , @xmath2 is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the current mass of the strange quark and @xmath12 is the quark fermi momentum.@xcite note that the terms with the chemical potential reduce the initial @xmath0 symmetry to the @xmath13 one .",
    "this follows from the fact that the hypercharge generator @xmath3 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the third component of the right handed isospin generator .",
    "henceforth we will omit the subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 , allowing various interpretations of the @xmath18 [ for example , in the dynamics of the kaon condensate , it is just the conventional isospin symmetry @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) ] .",
    "the terms containing the chemical potential in eq .",
    "( [ l - model ] ) are @xmath21 the last term in this expression makes the mass term in lagrangian density ( [ l - model ] ) to be @xmath22 .",
    "therefore for supercritical values of the chemical potential , @xmath23 , there is an instability resulting in the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath24 down to @xmath6 connected with the electrical charge @xmath25 .",
    "one may expect that this implies the existence of three ng bosons .",
    "the explicit calculation shows that this is not the case . to see this , we represent the field in the following form : @xmath26 by analyzing the quadratic forms for the two pairs of the fields @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ", we arrive at the explicit dispersion relations for the charged and neutral degrees of freedom,@xcite @xmath29 respectively . as is easy to check , here there are only two ng bosons with the following dispersion relations , @xmath30 which carry the quantum numbers of @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons .",
    "the third would - be ng boson , with the quantum numbers of @xmath33 , is massive in this model .",
    "this happens despite the fact that the potential part of lagrangian density ( [ l - model ] ) has three flat directions in the broken phase , as it should .",
    "the splitting between @xmath31 and @xmath33 occurs because of the seesaw mechanism in the kinetic part of the lagrangian density ( kinetic seesaw mechanism).@xcite this mechanism is provided by the first two terms in expression ( [ mu - terms ] ) which , because of the imaginary unit in front , mix the real and imaginary parts of the field @xmath8 .",
    "of course this effect is possible only because @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 symmetries are explicitly broken in this system at a nonzero @xmath2 . the latter point is reflected in the spectrum of @xmath37 mesons even for subcritical values of the chemical potential @xmath38 . in that case",
    ", there is a splitting of the energy gaps (  masses \" ) of @xmath39 and @xmath40 doublets . while the gap of the first doublet is equal to @xmath41 , the gap of the second one is @xmath42 .",
    "another noticeable point is that while the dispersion relation for @xmath32 is conventional , with the energy @xmath43 as the momentum @xmath44 goes to zero , the dispersion relation for @xmath31 is @xmath45 for small @xmath44 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ ng1 ] ) and ( [ ng2 ] ) ] .",
    "this fact is in accordance with the nielsen - chadha counting rule , @xmath46.@xcite here @xmath47 is the number of ng bosons with the linear dispersion law , @xmath43 , @xmath48 is the number of ng bosons with the quadratic dispersion law @xmath45 , and @xmath49 is the number of the generators in the coset space @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 is the symmetry group of the action and @xmath52 is the symmetry group of the ground state ) .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath45 also implies that , despite the presence of the condensate , the landau criterion@xcite fails in this model and the system is not a superfluid .",
    "indeed , recall that , according to the landau criterion , superfluidity takes place for velocities @xmath53 , where the critical velocity @xmath54 is the minimum of the ratios @xmath55 taken over all excitation branches and over all values of momentum @xmath44",
    ". therefore even the presence of a single branch with @xmath45 implies that @xmath56 .",
    "does the conventional anderson - higgs mechanism survive in the gauged version of this model despite the absence of one out of three ng bosons ?",
    "this question has motivated the work where the gauged @xmath1-model with the chemical potential for hypercharge was considered.@xcite the answer to this question is positive and we will consider it in the following sections .",
    "we will consider the dynamics in the gauged version of model ( [ l - model ] ) , i.e. , the model described by the lagrangian density @xmath57^\\dagger(d^\\mu - i\\mu\\delta^{\\mu0})\\phi - v(\\phi^\\dagger\\phi ) , \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and the covariant derivative @xmath59 .",
    "the field @xmath8 could be taken in the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) with @xmath60 being the expectation value that is determined by minimizing the effective potential .",
    "the @xmath18 gauge fields are given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are three pauli matrices , and the field strength @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is the u(1)@xmath65 gauge field with the strength @xmath66 .",
    "the hypercharge of the doublet @xmath8 equals + 1 .",
    "this model has the same structure as the electroweak theory without fermions and with the chemical potential for hypercharge @xmath3 .",
    "we consider two different cases : the case with @xmath67 , when the hypercharge @xmath3 is connected with the global @xmath68 symmetry , and the case with a nonzero @xmath69 , when the @xmath68 symmetry is gauged .",
    "the main characteristics of these dynamics are the following.@xcite for @xmath70 , the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath24 symmetry is caused solely by a supercritical chemical potential @xmath23 . in this case spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath24 is always accompanied by spontaneous breakdown of both the rotational symmetry @xmath71 [ down to @xmath72 and the electromagnetic @xmath6 connected with the electrical charge .",
    "therefore , in this case the @xmath73 group is broken spontaneously down to @xmath74 .",
    "this pattern of spontaneous symmetry breakdown takes place for both @xmath67 and @xmath75 , although the spectra of excitations in these two cases are different . also , the phase transition at the critical point @xmath76 is a second order one .",
    "the realization of both the ng mechanism and the anderson - higgs mechanism is conventional , despite the unconventional realization of the ng mechanism in the original ungauged model ( [ l - model ] ) . for @xmath67 , there are three ng bosons with the dispersion relation @xmath43 , as should be in the conventional realization of the breakdown @xmath77 when @xmath78 is a global symmetry .",
    "the other excitations are massive ( the anderson - higgs mechanism ) . for @xmath75 , there are two ng bosons with @xmath43 , as should be when only @xmath71 is a global symmetry ( the third ng boson is now  eaten \" by a photon - like combination of fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 that becomes massive ) . in accordance with the anderson - higgs mechanism ,",
    "the rest of excitations are massive .",
    "since the residual @xmath74 symmetry is low , the spectrum of excitations is very rich . in particular",
    ", the dependence of their energies on the longitudinal momentum @xmath81 , directed along the @xmath74 symmetry axis , and on the transverse one , @xmath82 , is quite different .",
    "a noticeable point is that there are two excitation branches , connected with two ng bosons , that behave as phonon - like quasiparticles for small momenta ( i.e. , their energy @xmath43 ) and as roton - like ones for large momenta @xmath81 , i.e. , there is a local minimum in @xmath83 for a value of @xmath81 of order @xmath84 ( see the plots of the dispersion relations in secs .",
    "[ 4 ] and [ 6 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath85 is a monotonically increasing function of the transverse momenta .",
    "the existence of the roton - like excitations is caused by the presence of gauge fields [ there are no such excitations in ungauged model ( [ l - model ] ) ] .",
    "as is well known , excitations with the behavior of such a type are present in superfluid systems and the microscopic origin of these excitations is a long standing problem.@xcite the connection of roton excitations with gauge fields in the gauged @xmath1-model is intriguing and could shed light on their microscopic nature .",
    "the presence of these excitations also suggests that the present model could be relevant for anisotropic superfluid systems .    in the case of @xmath86 ,",
    "the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath24 symmetry takes place even without chemical potential . introducing the chemical potential leads to dynamics similar to that in tumbling gauge theories.@xcite while in tumbling gauge theories the initial symmetry is breaking down ( `` tumbling '' ) in a few stages with increasing the running gauge coupling , in this model two different stages of symmetry breaking are determined by the values of chemical potential .",
    "when @xmath87 , the @xmath24 breaks down to @xmath6 , and the rotational @xmath71 is exact . in this case ,",
    "the conventional anderson - higgs mechanism is realized with three gauge bosons being massive and with no ng bosons .",
    "the presence of @xmath2 leads to splitting of the masses of charged @xmath88 gauge bosons .",
    "it is interesting that at this stage the phenomenon that we call dynamical transmutation of chemical potential takes place .",
    "it is reflected in such a rearrangement of the ground state when @xmath2 ceases to play the role of the chemical potential for hypercharge and becomes the chemical potential for electric charge instead .",
    "the second stage happens when @xmath89 becomes larger than @xmath90 .",
    "then one gets the same breaking pattern as that described above for @xmath91 , with @xmath77 .",
    "the spectrum of excitations is also similar to that case . at last , for all those values of the coupling constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 for which the effective potential is bounded from below , the phase transition at the critical point @xmath94 is a second order one .",
    "we begin by making the following general observation .",
    "let us consider a theory with a chemical potential @xmath2 connected with a conserved charge @xmath97 .",
    "let us introduce the quantity @xmath98 where on the right hand side we consider the minimum value amongst the ratios @xmath99 for all _ bosonic _ particles with @xmath100 in this same theory but _ without _ the chemical potential .",
    "then if @xmath101 , the theory exists only if the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath102 symmetry takes place there . indeed ,",
    "if the @xmath102 were exact in such a theory , the partition function , @xmath103 $ ] , would diverge ..",
    "@xcite ] examples of the restriction @xmath104 in relativistic theories were considered refs .   and .",
    "in fact , the value @xmath105 is a critical point separating different phases in the theory .",
    "it is important that since in the phase with @xmath101 the charge @xmath97 is not a good quantum number , @xmath2 ceases to play the role of a chemical potential determining the density of this charge .",
    "this point was emphasized in ref .  .",
    "there are a few options in this case .",
    "if there remains an exact symmetry connected with a charge @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a constant and @xmath108 represents some other generators , the chemical potential will determine the density of the charge @xmath109 ( we call this phenomena a dynamical transmutation of the chemical potential ) .",
    "otherwise , it becomes just a parameter determining the spectrum of excitations and other thermodynamic properties of the system ( the situation is similar to that taking place in models when a mass square @xmath110 becomes negative ) .",
    "we will encounter both these options in model ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "we begin by considering the case with @xmath111 and @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath112 , the @xmath73 symmetry is exact .",
    "of course in this case a confinement dynamics for three @xmath18 vector bosons takes place and it is not under our control .",
    "however , taking @xmath113 and choosing @xmath84 to be much larger than the confinement scale @xmath114 , we get controllable dynamics at large momenta @xmath44 of order @xmath84 .",
    "it includes three massless vector bosons @xmath115 and two doublets , @xmath40 and @xmath116 .",
    "the spectrum of the doublets is qualitatively the same as that in model ( [ l - model ] ) : the chemical potential leads to splitting the masses ( energy gaps ) of these doublets and , in tree approximation , their masses are @xmath42 and @xmath41 , respectively ( see sec .",
    "in order to make the tree approximation to be reliable , one should take @xmath92 to be small but much larger than the value of the running coupling @xmath117 related to the scale @xmath84 [ smallness of @xmath118 is guaranteed by the condition @xmath119 assumed above ] .",
    "the condition @xmath120 implies that the contributions both of vector boson and scalar loops are small , i.e. , there is no coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism ( recall that one should have @xmath121 for the cw mechanism).@xcite    let us now consider the case with @xmath122 in detail . since @xmath110 is equal to @xmath123 ( [ r ] ) , there should be spontaneous @xmath68 symmetry breaking in this case . for @xmath124 , the equations of motion derived from lagrangian density eq.([lagrangian ] ) read @xmath125 & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the point is that in that case vector bosons in the theory without chemical potential are massless .",
    "therefore , while for the chemical potential connected with hypercharge @xmath202 is positive , @xmath203 for the chemical potential connected with electrical charge @xmath185 there .",
    "this in turn implies that in that case there is no way for increasing @xmath123 through the process of the transmutation of the chemical potential as it happens in the case of negative @xmath110 .",
    "therefore for @xmath91 the phase in which both the @xmath6 symmetry and the rotational symmetry are broken occurs at once as @xmath89 becomes larger than @xmath110 .",
    "let us now describe the case with @xmath75 . in this case",
    "the @xmath68 symmetry is local and one should introduce a source term @xmath204 in lagrangian density ( [ lagrangian ] ) in order to make the system neutral with respect to hypercharge @xmath3 .",
    "this is necessary since otherwise in the system with a nonzero chemical potential @xmath2 the thermodynamic equilibrium could not be established .",
    "the value of the background hypercharge density @xmath205 ( representing very heavy particles ) is determined from the condition @xmath206.@xcite    after that , the analysis follows closely to that of the case with @xmath67 .",
    "because of the additional vector boson @xmath80 , there are now 12 quasiparticles in the spectrum .",
    "the sample of spontaneous @xmath73 symmetry breaking is the same as for @xmath67 both for @xmath207 and @xmath86 , with a tumbling - like scenario for the latter .",
    "however , for supercritical values of the chemical potential , there are now only two gapless ng modes ( the third one is  eaten \" by a photon - like combination of fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 that becomes massive ) .",
    "their dispersion relations in infrared read @xmath208 the rest 10 quasiparticles are gapped . the masses ( gaps ) of the massive states are @xmath209 , \\\\ \\delta^2 = \\mu \\phi + \\frac{\\phi_b^2 } { 2 } -\\sqrt{\\left(\\mu \\phi -\\frac{\\phi_b^2}{2}\\right)^2+\\phi^2 \\phi_b^2 } ,   & \\quad & [ \\times 2 ] , \\label{goes_to_0 } \\\\",

    "( [ goes_to_0 ] ) goes to zero together with @xmath69 , i.e. , these two degrees of freedom describe the two transverse states of massless vector boson @xmath80 in this limit .",
    "the dispersion relations for 10 massive particles are quite complicated . therefore in order to extract the corresponding dispersion relations , numerical calculations",
    "were performed.@xcite these dispersion relations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - all ] . bold and thin lines correspond to double degenerate and nondegenerate modes , respectively . as one can see , the two branches connected with gapless ng modes contain roton - like excitations at @xmath173 .",
    "other characteristic features of the spectrum are also similar to those of the spectrum for the case with @xmath213 shown in fig .",

    "a dynamics with an abnormal number of ng bosons realizes and , despite the presence of a condensate , there is no superfluidity in the system .",
    "the richness of the spectrum of excitations in the gauged version of the model is provided by the coexistence of spontaneous breakdown of rotational symmetry and that of the electromagnetic @xmath6 .",
    "it is noticeable that the spectrum contains roton - like excitations .",
    "their connection with gauge fields is intriguing and deserves further study .",
    "the coexistence of spontaneous breakdown of the rotational symmetry with that of the electromagnetic @xmath6 is provided by a condensate of vector charged bosons .",
    "the possibility of a condensation of vector bosons was considered in the literature in models different from the present one.@xcite the advantage of the linear @xmath1-model without fermions is in its simplicity .",
    "the model admits a controllable dynamics that puts the creation of a vector condensate on a solid ground and allows to study the spectrum of excitations in detail .",
    "one can expect that the phenomena discussed here should exist in a wide class of relativistic models at finite density . in connection with that , it is noticeable that recently a general approach to the description of systems with an abnormal number of ng bosons has been developed by nambu.@xcite also , in a very recent paper@xcite the phenomenon with an abnormal number of ng bosons was revealed in the extended nambu - jona - lasinio model with spontaneous breakdown of the color @xmath214 down to @xmath215 .",
