    "many aspects of the experimental program at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) depend on the analysis of processes at large momentum transfers containing multiple hard scales . as such",
    ", they will be influenced by improved formulations of factorization in qcd at unintegrated level  @xcite , which serve in multi - scale processes to control perturbative large logarithms to higher orders of perturbation theory and to describe appropriately nonperturbative physics in the initial and final states of the collision .",
    "these formulations involve transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) , or unintegrated , parton decay and parton density functions ( pdfs )  @xcite .    a broad class of such multiple - scale events is given by small-@xmath0 processes .",
    "these processes are one of the main sources of final states in the central region at the lhc  @xcite . besides , they are responsible for the sizeable rates of forward large - p@xmath1 jet production at the lhc , giving rise to new phenomenology in the lhc forward region compared to previous collider experiments , e.g. forward jet physics  @xcite .",
    "small-@xmath0 tmd factorization and pdfs ( see for instance recent reviews in  @xcite ) serve for the perturbative resummation of high - energy logarithmic corrections and for the development of parton shower algorithms capable of incorporating multi - gluon coherence including the effects of large - angle , noncollinear emission .",
    "most of tmd computational tools relevant to small-@xmath0 and forward physics at the lhc have so far been developed within a quenched approximation in which only gluon and valence quark contributions are taken into account at tmd level  @xcite . while this gives a sensible approximation , based on the dominance of spin-1 exchange processes at high energies , to the asymptotic behavior of production processes coupled to gluons such as heavy flavor and scalar production , it is mandatory to go beyond this approximation to include preasymptotic effects , and to treat final states associated with quark - initiated processes such as drell - yan production . in this work",
    "we take first steps to address this issue by including sea quark contributions and examine forward drell - yan production .",
    "drell - yan processes at the lhc are instrumental in precision electroweak measurements , in luminosity monitoring and pdf determinations , and in new physics searches  @xcite .",
    "studies of drell - yan at tmd level have recently been performed in the framework of the soft - collinear effective theory  @xcite .",
    "results on high - energy logarithmic corrections to drell - yan have been obtained in the @xmath2 channel  @xcite and in the associated production channel @xmath3 heavy quarks  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "early attempts  @xcite to treat the unintegrated pdf evolution beyond the quenched approximation include quarks via splitting probabilities to lowest order of perturbation theory , neglecting any transverse momentum dependence in the branching . in  @xcite k@xmath1-dependent kinematic corrections",
    "are included , while the splitting kernels are still taken in lowest order .",
    "also , a program to perform shower monte carlo evolution at unintegrated level has recently been proposed  @xcite based on the expansion  @xcite in two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) kernels .",
    "this program is formulated at the next - to - leading logarithmic order . however",
    ", this does not include small-@xmath0 logarithmic effects which are present beyond nlo in flavor singlet distributions .",
    "the approach of the present paper is based on the high - energy form of the ( off - shell ) tmd quark green function introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this is obtained by generalizing to finite transverse momenta , in the high - energy region , the 2pi expansion  @xcite .",
    "the main point is to construct unintegrated sea - quark distributions incorporating the effects of the tmd gluon - to - quark splitting kernel  @xcite , which contains all single - logarithmic small-@xmath0 corrections to sea quark evolution for any order of perturbation theory . in order to relate this parton splitting kernel to forward vector boson production",
    ", we analyze the flavor exchange process at high energy according to the  reggeized quark \" calculus  @xcite .",
    "this extends the effective action formalism  @xcite , currently explored at nlo  @xcite , to amplitudes with quark exchange in terms of effective degrees of freedom , the so - called reggeized quarks  @xcite .",
    "the use of the effective vertices  @xcite ensures gauge invariance of the coefficients relevant to perform the high - energy factorization  @xcite for vector boson production , despite the off - shell parton .",
    "we then examine kinematic effects related to the difference between the virtuality of the exchanged parton and its transverse part which , although formally subdominant both in the collinear and in the high - energy expansions , can nevertheless be numerically non - negligible .",
    "these kinematic effects are similar to those observed in the study of  @xcite .",
    "we perform a numerical study of the kinematic terms at the level of the partonic @xmath4 cross section , and compare this with the @xmath5 result  @xcite .",
    "the formulation proposed in this work can be implemented in a parton shower monte carlo event generator .",
    "details of the formulation and shower implementation will be described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the present paper is the following .",
    "2 we apply the reggeized quark calculus to examine @xmath4 boson production and reobtain the tmd quark splitting function . in sec .  3 we investigate kinematic effects in the factorization formula and study this numerically .",
    "we give conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section we relate the @xmath4 boson production cross section to the unintegrated quark density defined at high energy via the transverse momentum dependent kernel  @xcite . for definiteness",
    "we consider factorization of the @xmath6 matrix element into off - shell point - like @xmath7 coefficient and off - shell gluon - to - quark splitting function , which is of direct phenomenological relevance for forward drell - yan production .    within the reggeized quark formalism of  @xcite this process",

    "although evaluated off - shell , the splitting function in eq .",
    "is universal  @xcite .",
    "it reduces to the collinear splitting function at lowest order for @xmath50 , but in the high energy limit it factorizes correctly the finite @xmath51 dependence to all orders . by using this result ,",
    "the unintegrated sea quark distribution is given by @xmath52 we thus write the forward @xmath4-boson hadronic cross section in the high energy factorized form @xmath53 with @xmath54 given in eq .   and @xmath55 the ( integrated ) parton distribution as provided by collinear factorization .",
    "the scale @xmath56 in eqs .   and   is an initial infra - red scale at which the parton distribution functions are defined .",
    "the dependence on this scale occurs for the tmd distributions as a direct consequence of the matching procedure between high energy and collinear factorization .",
    "the presence of collinear singularities in the integrations over momentum lines connecting the 2pi amplitudes requires the use of a regulator for the bfkl gluon green s function which breaks the scale invariance of the lo bfkl equation .",
    "in addition to the bfkl gluon density , also the integral over @xmath57 in eq .   is collinear divergent in the limit @xmath58 and requires regularization , leading to an additional dependence on the scale @xmath56 .",
    "while in  @xcite this is achieved through dimensional regularization in @xmath59 dimensions , a cut - off regularization will be used in future monte - carlo realizations of eq .  .",

    ".    we will be interested in applications of the sea quark distribution in eq .   to shower monte carlo generators including the transverse momentum dependence of the parton branching , such as  @xcite .",
    "compared to previous tmd approaches  @xcite , this distribution includes the finite-@xmath62 dependence of the kernel  , responsible for all - order logarithmically enhanced corrections to quark evolution at small @xmath0 .",
    "for these applications it is relevant to investigate the size of corrections associated with the high - energy kinematic approximations discussed earlier .",
    "we turn to this in the next section , and study the numerical effect of the kinematic contributions on the off - shell @xmath4-boson production cross section .",
    "in this section we discuss that the accuracy of the factorized expression obtained above can be increased by going beyond the strong ordering approximation in eqs .  , .",
    "we will write the convolution integral in terms of the virtuality of the four - momentum exchanged in the @xmath17-channel , @xmath64 , rather than the transverse momentum . while the two formulations coincide in the asymptotic high - energy limit @xmath65 , they differ by inclusion of finite-@xmath66 terms .",
    "we examine numerically the role of these terms .",
    "the formulation in @xmath67 arises naturally if we remove the constraint @xmath68 in the effective vertex of eq .  .",
    "the kinematically improved version of this vertex is @xmath69 gauge invariance can be verified similarly to eqs .  , .",

    "replaced by @xmath71 where @xmath72 the angular average can now be performed exactly , and yields @xmath73 unlike eq .",
    "the above expression no longer decouples in transverse momentum space .",
    "however , by changing variable to @xmath74 in the convolution integral , we get @xmath75 this result shares some features with the results in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , as in  @xcite it takes into account subleading corrections to strong ordering by keeping track of the exact kinematic relation between virtuality and transverse momentum .",
    "it was shown in the numerical nlo - dglap analysis of  @xcite that these kinematic contributions provide a large fraction of the full corrections at nlo .",
    "on the other hand , unlike  @xcite eq .   contains the dynamical effects of transverse momentum dependent terms in the gluon - to - quark splitting kernel .",

    "what dominates this region are the transverse momentum dependent terms , which are kept correctly by both eq .   and eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : deltasmall](a ) that in the small @xmath83 region the collinear expression obtained by setting @xmath80 in eq .",
    "is far from the full result , due to missing tmd corrections to the kernel  .",

    "[ fig : deltabigg ] .",
    "however , the full result contains significant corrections with respect to these curves , corresponding to terms that are subdominant both in the collinear and in the high - energy expansions .",
    "we see that a non - negligible part of these corrections can be taken into account by including kinematic contributions from terms beyond the strong ordering in the lightcone minus momenta , as eq .",
    "this is analogous to effects observed in  @xcite . as a result eq .",
    "provides a closer approximation to the full matrix element .",
    "it can be verified numerically that the corrections die out in the limit of asymptotically large @xmath8 .",
    "this analysis is however significant for applications to finite collider energies .",
    "we thus observe that taking into account tmd terms in the parton splitting and the reggeized quark coefficient enables one to extend the description of vector boson production in terms of factorized quark distributions from the collinear region into the region where @xmath83 is of order @xmath89 and transverse momenta are no longer strongly ordered .",
    "this is a region where collinear approximations are seen not to be sufficient , and it is relevant to forward drell - yan .",
    "we will use the unintegrated quark distribution thus defined in forthcoming studies  @xcite . as a result of tmd terms ,",
    "on the other hand , the initial state kinematics becomes rather more complex .",
    "corrections to longitudinal momentum ordering in the effective vertices are seen to be numerically significant when @xmath83 is of order the vector boson mass . to this end",
    "it is useful to employ the formulation given in this section which includes the exact one - loop kinematics .",
    "drell - yan production processes are instrumental in hadron collider experiments both for hadronic physics studies and for new physics searches . at the lhc",
    "a new kinematic region opens up for forward drell - yan , in which the qcd treatment of the production process and associated final states acquires new features due to multi - parton radiation over long rapidity intervals .",
    "the emission of soft gluons that are not collinearly ordered becomes relevant , and effects of color coherence set in associated with the region of small longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath0 .",
    "taking this into account calls for improved formulations of factorization in qcd at unintegrated , or transverse momentum dependent , level .",
    "fully general tmd factorization formulas are still lacking  @xcite , due to the difficulty in disentangling systematically soft and collinear gluon correlations between initial and final states .",
    "this is illustrated , for instance , by back - to - back di - hadron and di - jet hadroproduction  @xcite . in the case of small @xmath0 ,",

    "phenomenological applications of the reggeized quark formalism were investigated in  @xcite using the approach  @xcite to tmd pdfs . compared to these studies ,",
    "the main feature of our approach is that it includes , besides the lowest - order quark splitting function , the full series of finite-@xmath90 terms in the tmd kernel .",
    "these terms control the perturbative summation of small-@xmath0 logarithmic corrections to flavor - singlet observables to all orders in @xmath76 .",
