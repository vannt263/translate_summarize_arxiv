    "the evolution of a quantum system is halted when very many measurements are performed in a finite time , in order to check whether the system is still in its initial state .",
    "this phenomenon is called quantum zeno effect  @xcite ( qze ) : the survival probability at a given time goes to one as the measurement frequency increases .    the survival probability after @xmath3 measurements in a time @xmath4 is expressed by a product formula depending on @xmath4 and @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the uniformity in time of the qze , and study the behavior of the zeno product formula for large @xmath3 _ and _ @xmath4 .",
    "let us first recall the basics of the qze .",
    "let a quantum system be prepared , at time @xmath5 , in the state @xmath6 , a normalized vector in the separable hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the scalar product in @xmath7 .",
    "the system evolves under the action of the hamiltonian @xmath9 , a self - adjoint operator on @xmath7 , through the unitary group @xmath10 .",
    "the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are called survival ( or return ) amplitude and probability , respectively , and represent the amplitude and probability that the quantum system is found back in the initial state @xmath6 at time @xmath4 .",
    "if the state  @xmath6 is in the domain of the hamiltonian  @xmath9 , we have for @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the variance of the hamiltonian in the state @xmath6 .",
    "let us now carry out @xmath3 measurements at time intervals @xmath16 , in order to check whether the system remains in its initial state .",
    "if at each and every time the measurement has a positive outcome and the system is found in its initial state , the state `` collapses '' and the evolution starts anew from @xmath6 .",
    "thus the survival probability after @xmath3 measurements reads @xmath17 this is called _ zeno product formula _ , and will be the subject of our investigation .",
    "the limit of infinitely frequent measurements , @xmath18 , of the zeno product formula can be easily computed using the taylor expansion in  ( [ taylorp ] ) : if the initial state @xmath6 is in the domain of the hamiltonian @xmath9 one gets @xmath19 uniformly in @xmath4 on compact subsets of @xmath20 , see  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if one performs frequent measurements on a quantum system in a given time interval @xmath21 $ ] , a qze takes place  @xcite : the transitions to states different from the initial one are hindered , despite the action of the hamiltonian ( in general the state @xmath6 is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath9 ) .",
    "the qze has been successfully demonstrated in a variety of physical systems , on experiments involving ionic hyperfine levels  @xcite , photons  @xcite , nuclear spins  @xcite , optical pumping  @xcite , ultracold atoms  @xcite , level dynamics of individual ions  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , optical systems  @xcite , and cavity quantum electrodynamics  @xcite . for a review on the mathematical and physical aspects of the subject see  @xcite .",
    "the qze can be obtained both by pulsed and continuous measurements , as well as by a strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been realized that , by exploiting the quantum zeno dynamics , one gets a powerful approach to control .",
    "the key idea is to engineer a given evolution by a rapid sequence of projections  @xcite .",
    "this can yield a berry phase  @xcite or , more generally , non - abelian geometric phases  @xcite , a resource for holonomic quantum computation .",
    "moreover , the qze can be seen as an effective way of imposing constraints and boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "finally , notice that the qze is a purely quantum phenomenon : in classical mechanics it is not observed , since the measurement process can be conceived so that it does not interfere with the evolution of the system .    in this article",
    "we want to investigate the behavior of the zeno product formula  ( [ eq : pntdef ] ) as the observation time becomes large , @xmath22 , namely the double limit : @xmath23    notice that , since the time dependence in  ( [ eq : pntdef ] ) is given through the ratio @xmath24 , the long - time limit  ( [ s.c.limit ] ) is in fact a semiclassical limit , where the planck constant @xmath25 , namely , @xmath26 in this respect , the limit  ( [ s.c.limit1 ] ) answers the following question : what happens to the evolution of the system when we compare the period between two successive measurements with the quantum scale given by @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the relevant energy scale of the state ?    for the analysis of the classical limit of the qze see  @xcite . by a semiclassical analysis on phase space  @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that the qze vanishes at all orders in the planck constant @xmath29 , in the limit @xmath30 , and thus it is a purely quantum phenomenon without classical analogue , at the same level of tunneling .",
    "( notice , however , that at variance with  @xcite , in the present situation the state @xmath6 and the hamiltonian @xmath9 do not depend on @xmath29 . )",
    "heuristically , if we perform first the limit in @xmath3 and then the limit in @xmath4 we get qze , namely @xmath31 conversely , for a decaying system , if we invert the order of the two limits we obtain a classical behavior , namely @xmath32 therefore , the limit  ( [ s.c.limit ] ) does not exist because it depends on the way in which it is computed .    in order to better understand the transition from  ( [ quantum ] ) to  ( [ classical ] ) , we look at the double limit  ( [ s.c.limit ] ) when @xmath4 diverges as a power of @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a fixed time interval and @xmath35 , see the right panel of fig .  [ fig ] . in this case",
    "the survival probability @xmath36 depends only on @xmath3 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , in the following we will consider the product formula @xmath39 and investigate the limit @xmath40 for different values of @xmath41 .",
    "the value @xmath42 will correspond to the qze limit  ( [ eq : qzelimit ] ) , @xmath43 while the value @xmath44 will correspond to the large - time limit of an evolution stroboscopically measured with period @xmath38 , @xmath45 the latter regime , describing a quantum system subject to periodic kicks , has become a paradigmatic example in the study of quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "it represents a standard test bed for the investigation of different features of quantum systems whose classical counterparts have a chaotic evolution . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of a kicked quantum system undergoing repeated measurements of momentum has been investigated .",
    "a diffusive behavior has been obtained , even when the dynamics of the classical counterpart is not chaotic , and in general , the system has been shown to have an anomalous diffusive behavior , characteristic of intermittent classical dynamical systems and random walks in random environments  @xcite .",
    "thus as @xmath37 ranges from 0 to 1 , one goes from qze to a kicked dynamics , and for a decaying system the limit probability @xmath46 goes from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "we will show that the transition is abrupt with a threshold at @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig ] .",
    "moreover , we will also consider larger values of the exponent , i.e.  @xmath49 , which correspond to stroboscopic measurements with a larger and larger period .",
    "in such a case the limit probability @xmath46 of a decaying system is obviously 0 , but interesting exceptions will occur at particular values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 for systems with recurrences .",
    "notice also that , as a consequence of the previous discussion , the limit  ( [ eqn : nlimit ] ) can be viewed as the semiclassical limit  ( [ s.c.limit1 ] ) when @xmath29 goes to zero as a power of @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a fixed constant .",
    "therefore , for short in the following we will often refer to the regime with zero limit probability as the _ classical _ regime , as opposed to a nonzero limit probability characteristic of a _",
    "quantum _ regime , see fig [ fig ] .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ sect : mainresult1 ] we discuss the case @xmath52 and we show that @xmath1 is the threshold exponent between quantum and classical behavior ; in section [ sect : mainresult2 ] we focus on the case @xmath53 and we prove that , essentially , the system exhibits always a classical behavior , but the limit becomes sensitive to the spectral properties of the state @xmath6 and to some interesting arithmetical properties of @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
