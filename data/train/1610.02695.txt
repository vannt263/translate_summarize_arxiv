    "monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) have attracted recently much attention due to their exceptional properties , such as coupling of spin and valley degrees of freedom , which allows for the valley polarization with a circularly polarized light in these materials  @xcite .",
    "recent magneto - photoluminescence experiments revealed the significant zeeman splitting of emission lines associated with optical recombination of excitons and trions in different valleys .",
    "the effective exciton @xmath4-factors of this `` valley zeeman effect '' in a magnetic field directed normal to a monolayer plane were found to be @xmath6 for a wide range of investigated materials , including selenides  @xcite , sulphides  @xcite and tellurides  @xcite .",
    "the multi band @xmath0  method is perfectly suited for theoretical investigation of magneto - optical and transport effects , including zeeman effect , optical absorption and photogalvanics  @xcite .",
    "the available two - band @xmath0  models describing electronic spectra in tmdcs  @xcite account for the bottom conduction and topmost valence bands and are parameterized by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "the simple two - band model is , however , insufficient for calculation of exciton zeeman effect since the exciton @xmath4-factor @xmath5 vanishes in the two - band @xmath0  approximation  [ ] .",
    "therefore to obtain nonzero @xmath5 additional terms describing contributions of remote bands should be included in the two - band @xmath0  model  @xcite , which make the model less transparent .",
    "moreover parametrization of the @xmath0  model by fitting the dft band structure only in the vicinity of distinct points of the brillouin zone is less reliable and allows for a much freedom in the choice of parameters .    in this work",
    "we use an alternative approach based on the idea proposed in ref .  [ ] .",
    "this approach comprises three steps , namely , ( i ) use dft - based calculations of electronic states in tmdcs as a starting point , ( ii ) use atomistic tight - binding ( tb ) model to fit the electronic spectrum and wave functions along the high - symmetry paths of the brillouin zone , and ( iii ) derive @xmath0  hamiltonian by decomposing the tb model in the vicinity of a given wave vector in the brillouin zone . as a result",
    ", we obtain a multi band @xmath0  hamiltonian ( the number of bands is equal to the number of atomic orbitals included in the tb model ) with a set of parameters that are uniquely determined by the tb parametrization .",
    "this hamiltonian can be further used for calculating the valley zeeman effect , landau levels , etc .    as a starting point",
    "we use several existing eleven - band tb models  @xcite .",
    "these models include @xmath9-type orbitals of metal atoms and @xmath10-type orbitals of chalcogen atoms , and capture all symmetries of the studied system .",
    "the resulting @xmath0  hamiltonian , which describes dispersion of the bottom conduction and topmost valence bands , contains six bands that have even parity with respect to mirror reflection in the monolayer plane .",
    "we present a systematic parametrization of the six - band @xmath0  hamiltonian by expansion of tb hamiltonians  @xcite in the vicinity of @xmath2 points of the brillouin zone for different materials ( mos@xmath3 , ws@xmath3 , mose@xmath3 , wse@xmath3 ) and different tb models .",
    "we also do the whole three - step procedure on our own , i.e. , perform post - dft calculations by applying @xmath7 formalism to obtain reliable band gaps and accurate band dispersion , fit it with the tb model and do the @xmath0  decomposition , which allows us , as a result , to obtain an independent @xmath0  parameterization .",
    "we want to stress the novelty of using @xmath7 set of data to extract tb parameters since in previous studies the main focus was made on dft calculations using mainly local or semi - local exchange - correlation functionals  @xcite , whereas hybrid functional was also used  @xcite to partially correct the severe underestimation of band gap values usually observed at the dft level for mos@xmath3 monolayers , see ref .",
    "[ ] for a recent review .",
    "the use of @xmath7 correction strongly affects the effective charge carrier masses  @xcite too .",
    "then , we use the derived six - band @xmath0  hamiltonian to calculate effective masses , landau levels , and the effective exciton @xmath4-factor @xmath5 in different tmdcs . we analyze the main contributions to @xmath5 , which result from the mixing with excited conduction and deep valence bands .",
    "we show that the calculated values of @xmath5 and effective masses vary in a wide range for different tb parameterizations .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath5 for available in literature tb models ( @xmath11 ) are rather far from experimental values .",
    "however using our dft+@xmath7 calculations and the tb fitting procedure we were able to find additional @xmath0  parameterization sets , which well describe the experimental exciton @xmath4-factor ( @xmath6 ) , as well as conduction and valence band effective masses and the wave functions coefficients .",
    "this result underlies the importance of the careful choice for the dft starting point calculations and tb parameterizations : along with effective masses and energy gaps the @xmath4-factor value may serve as a test for improving both the dft calculations and tb models .",
    "as a starting point for construction of an effective @xmath0-hamiltonian we will use eleven - band tight - binding models developed in refs .  .",
    "these tight - binding models include three @xmath10-type orbitals on each of the two chalcogen atoms ( x ) and five @xmath9-type orbitals on a metal atom ( m ) .",
    "the electron wave function within the tight - binding approximation is presented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals @xmath12  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a number of an electronic band , @xmath15 is a wave vector , @xmath16 denotes the type of an atom , @xmath17 runs through the atoms of a given type , @xmath18 enumerates the set of orbitals , @xmath19 gives the position of atoms in a two - dimensional lattice , and @xmath20 are coefficients .",
    "the basis orbitals of the eleven - band tight - binding model are  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the orbital with a @xmath9-like symmetry of the m atom and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the symmetric and asymmetric combinations of the @xmath10-type orbitals of the top ( @xmath27 ) and bottom ( @xmath28 ) x atoms in the unit cell , @xmath29 and @xmath30 axes lie in the monolayer plane , and @xmath31 is the monolayer normal . the spin orbit interaction between electron spin and orbital momenta of atomic orbitals  @xcite",
    "is neglected in this work .",
    "if the @xmath32 mirror symmetry is conserved , i.e. for a free - standing monolayer in the absence of external electric field and strain , the hamiltonian , which describes the energy spectrum of a monolayer electron with a wave vector @xmath15 , written in the basis eq .",
    "has the form @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the 6@xmath356 block acting on the orbitals with even with respect to @xmath32 symmetry , and @xmath36 is the 5@xmath355 block acting on the orbitals with odd symmetry .",
    "the exact form of blocks @xmath34 and @xmath36 depends on a particular tight - binding model  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the bloch functions of the bottom conduction and topmost valence bands , which are of the main interest in this work , are even with respect to @xmath32 reflection  @xcite , and therefore these bands are described by the @xmath34 block .",
    "we note that magnetic field normal to a monolayer does not break the parity of wave functions , and hence we do not need the @xmath36 block in the calculation of @xmath5 .",
    "we also note , that the mixing of the @xmath34 and @xmath36 blocks by a perturbation that breaks @xmath32 symmetry does not affect @xmath5 in the first order in this perturbation .    to construct an effective @xmath0  hamiltonian in the vicinity of @xmath37 points , where @xmath38 is the lattice constant",
    ", we will decompose the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath39 over a small wave vector @xmath40 . up to the second - order terms",
    "this decomposition yields @xmath41    electron wave functions at @xmath2 valleys of mx@xmath3 transform according to irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the c@xmath42 point group .",
    "we denote six wave functions that diagonalize @xmath43 at @xmath44 as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where a superscript names the electronic band and a subscript denotes the corresponding irreducible representation ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , see tab .",
