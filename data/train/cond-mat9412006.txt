    "the relationship between the sequence and conformation of a heteropolymer is one of the most challenging unsolved problems in biophysics . in the case of proteins",
    ", it is widely believed that the native functional conformation is , in a sense , `` written '' in the sequence of the heteropolymer in the `` language '' of the interactions between monomer species .",
    "this conformation is also believed to be both the ground state from thermodynamic point of view ( better to say , it is structurally very close to the ground state , up to some short scale thermal and/or frozen fluctuations ) and reliably accessible from the kinetic point of view .",
    "the fact that even chains with random sequences can have a unique frozen ground state was first discussed in terms of phenomenological models @xcite , where the freezing transition was shown to be similar to that of the random energy model ( rem ) @xcite .",
    "the rem - like freezing transition was also derived starting from a microscopic hamiltonian in which the interactions between pairs of monomers were assumed to be random , independently taken from a gaussian distribution @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the nature of interactions between species was parameterized in terms of the mean and width of the monomer - monomer interaction distribution .",
    "thus , in this sense , polymer sequence was not explicitly included in this model , since it is absent from the hamiltonian . as for models with polymer sequences explicitly present ,",
    "two have been considered so far : 2 letter ising - type model @xcite and the so - called @xmath2-charge model @xcite .",
    "these models were shown to also exhibit a freezing phase transition for random chains .",
    "therefore , it is natural to conjecture that any sort of random heteropolymer will have this kind of transition , and the question is whether we are able to understand the properties and characteristic temperature of this transition for realistic models of heteropolymers .",
    "indeed , proteins , for example , are comprised of 20 kinds of different monomers , which interact to each other in a complicated manner .",
    "there are several relevant types of interactions between different monomers , such as van - der - waals interactions , dipole - dipole interactions , hydrogen bonds , and hydrophobic interactions .",
    "as long as we are speaking about short - range interactions , interactions can be described in terms of a matrix : if there are @xmath0 types of monomers , we have a @xmath1 matrix , where each @xmath3 matrix element represents the energy of interaction between monomers of the types @xmath4 and @xmath5 , given that they are in spatial contact .",
    "there were several attempts in the literature to derive this kind of `` interaction '' matrix for real amino acids ( see , in particular , @xcite ) .",
    "it is rather difficult , however , to derive this kind of matrix .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of heteropolymer properties to deviations of the interaction matrix is unclear . for computer simulations , for example",
    ", it is important to know how precise one should be in choosing the interaction energies in order to reproduce the native state and to avoid the appearance of some other state , structurally completely different , which may appear as the ground state of a simulated system due to an imperfect interaction matrix . of course",
    ", other non - protein heteropolymers might be also of interest .    in this paper , we consider the freezing transition for a heteropolymer with an arbitrary interaction matrix .",
    "we derive a general formalism for the analysis of the freezing transition of random chains in which only short range interactions are assumed .",
    "in addition to the formal benefit that the general treatment establishes a formalism with which other short range species interaction models can be derived as special cases by using specific interaction matrices , this theory can be used to analyze what properties of a species - species interactions matrix effect the freezing transition and in what way .",
    "consider a heteropolymer chain with a frozen sequence of monomers @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of monomer along the chain ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath6 is the sort of monomer @xmath7 in the given sequence .",
    "let @xmath0 be the total number of different monomer species , @xmath9 . in the condensed globular state , the spatial structure of the chain",
    "is governed by volume interactions between monomers .",
    "the disorder and heteropolymer effects of different monomer species comes mainly through pairwise monomer - to - monomer interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "higher order interactions provide the non - specific excluded volume effect , while chain connectivity defines the set of available placements of monomers in space .",
    "this is clear when one considers the lattice model , where subsequent monomers are nearest neighbors on the lattice ( chain connectivity ) : a site on the lattice can be occupied by only one monomer ( excluded volume effect ) , and the energy is given as a sum of pairwise interactions of the nearest neighbors on the lattice .",
    "the complicated set of monomer - monomer interactions , related to frozen - in sequence , appears then due to the restricted set of pairings of monomers in the space .",
    "the interaction part of hamiltonian can be therefore written in a rather simple way : @xmath10 where @xmath11 gives the mayer function of short range interaction between monomers of _ species _ @xmath4 and @xmath5 , placed in space at the distance @xmath12 apart from each other , @xmath6 is the species of monomer number @xmath7 ( `` spin '' of monomer @xmath7 ) , and @xmath13 is either kroneker or dirac delta .",
    "eq  ( [ eq : genham ] ) has the simple interpretation that monomers number @xmath7 and @xmath14 interact based upon their proximity , @xmath15 , and the second virial coefficient of interaction between the species of the two monomers , @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 contribution contains all higher order interactions of monomers .",
    "we assume that it is `` homopolymeric '' in form , i.e. it does not depend on the monomer species , but only on the overall density @xmath18 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath19 , where all virial coefficients @xmath20 are assumed to be positive ( repulsive ) .    throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the following notation : upper case roman characters label monomer numbers , i.e. bead number along the chain ( @xmath8 ) , lower case roman characters label monomer species numbers ( @xmath21 ) , and lower case greek characters are for replica indices ( @xmath22 ) , which will be defined later .",
    "we will be also using the notation for vectors and operators ( matrices ) with the clear indication of the dimensionality of the corresponding space , as we consider several different spaces simultaneously .",
    "for example , the interaction matrix with matrix elements @xmath23 will be denoted as @xmath24 . in this notation",

    "the standard way to approach the partition function of a system with frozen disorder is to employ , first , the principle of self - averaging of free energy and , second , the replica trick : @xmath31 where @xmath32 means average over the set of all possible @xmath33 sequences .    in this paper , we consider random sequences , meaning that the species @xmath34 appear independently along the chain with the probabilities @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , so that the probability of realization of the given sequence @xmath37 is written as @xmath38    collecting the above equations , we can write the key value of @xmath39-replica partition function as @xmath40 \\right\\}^n     \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\sum_{\\rm seq } p_{\\rm seq } \\sum _ { c_1 , \\ldots , c_n } \\exp \\left [ - { 1 \\over t } \\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{n } { \\cal h } \\left ( c_{\\alpha } , { \\rm seq } \\right ) \\right ]    \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 stand for conformations of replica number @xmath42 .    for each conformation and each replica , we introduce density distributions of all species as @xmath43 for simplicity , we will not explicitly include the sequence independent terms @xmath17 from the original hamiltonian  ( [ eq : genham ] ) .",

    "operator @xmath47 is @xmath23 with respect to monomer species , and it is diagonal in both replica space and real coordinate space , meaning that it has matrix elements @xmath48 .",
    "the next step is to perform hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite of the form @xmath49 here @xmath50 are the fields conjugated to the corresponding densities and @xmath51 is normalization factor which comes from integration over @xmath52 .",
    "note that the sum over sequences enters only in the last `` source '' term of this expression : @xmath53 the summation , or average , over the sequences is easier to describe in non - vector notation : @xmath54    as in case of two - letter heteropolymer , to extract the relevant order parameters , we expand over the powers of the fields @xmath52 ( high temperature expansion ) and keep terms up to @xmath55 : @xmath56 \\sum _",

    "while taking the @xmath112 limit , we have to consider @xmath87 to be in between @xmath39 and @xmath113 , so that @xmath114 means the existence of grouping of replicas , or broken replica permutation symmetry , while @xmath87 approaching 1 means the restoration of replica symmetry .",

    "thus , for @xmath129 , we can optimize the free energy with respect to @xmath87 and @xmath18 independently .",
    "however , if this condition is not valid , the coupling between density and the replica overlap order parameter becomes significant ; this should lead to other interesting physical phenomena , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the `` homopolymeric '' attractive second virial term , in competition with the repulsive higher order terms in @xmath17 , is responsible for the formation and maintenance of the globular conformation with a reasonably high density .",
    "therefore , @xmath130 primarily enters into homopolymer effects , such as the coil to globule transition .",
    "other effects , such as the freezing transition , are purely heteropolymeric , and are due to @xmath131 , or @xmath120 terms ; they are related to the choice of some energetically preferential conformations out of the total vast number of globular conformations .    for the homopolymer case ( @xmath132 or @xmath133 ) or the effective homopolymer case ( a heteropolymeric interaction matrix is rendered homopolymeric due to the choice of composition @xmath134 ; say , @xmath135 , while others @xmath136 ) , we immediately see that @xmath137 , so @xmath138 and thus there is no freezing transition .",

    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that in the potts model , all monomers from differing species interact with each other in the same way , so that the part of the chain without similar monomers is effectively homopolymeric . as @xmath0 increases , these homopolymer - like regions increase and the freezing temperature consequently decreases .",

    "a consequence of this symmetry is that these moments vanish in the homopolymer case ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "we now pass to analysis of two opposite extremes in the equation  ( [ eq : finalselfconsist1 ] ) .      as we are instructed by the examples of potts and @xmath2-charge models , what is important in high @xmath161 limit is the singularity of the right hand side of  ( [ eq : finalselfconsist1 ] ) .",
    "this is obviously governed by high @xmath60 terms of power series , which are basically related to @xmath212 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the standard problems of @xmath213 statistical physics , such as the @xmath213 ising model , the ideal polymer , or other markovian processes , where @xmath214 plays the role of the transfer matrix .",
    "it is well known that highest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix is only relevant in @xmath215 limit ( `` ground state dominance principle '' ) . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath216 , where @xmath217 is highest eigenvalue of @xmath218 matrix , and thus @xmath219 to find the next terms in asymptotic formula for @xmath152 , we note that the most divergent term in eq  ( [ eq : cumulexp ] ) comes form the last term in  ( [ eq : finalselfconsist1 ] ) and is due to @xmath220 term in  ( [ eq : defcumul ] ) , it diverges as @xmath221 .",
    "we know , however , that this term vanishes for both potts and @xmath2-charge models .",
    "moreover , we can show , that it vanishes also for many other models with some regularities , producing cancellation of correlations and anti - correlations between matrix elements of @xmath186 .",
    "for this reason , we keep next to the highest singularity , thus obtaining @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of the @xmath225 operator .",

    "therefore freezing transition for stiff chains is very dependent on the pattern of interactions , not only on their overall heterogeneity .",
    "this has clear physical meaning . in case of stiff chains ,",
    "real monomers represent the physical units of interaction . in other words ,",
    "quasi monomers almost coincide with monomers . in terms of propagation , or chains of collisions",
    "( see above ) , it is clear that highest eigenvalue of @xmath228 matrix corresponds to the lowest ( because of the sign ) energy of interaction , while the corresponding eigenvector , in terms of the obvious quantum mechanical analogy , is the linear combination of monomers which realizes this lowest energy and thus controls the freezing temperature .",
    "the examination of the small @xmath161 case may be on the first glance questionable , as our approach is entirely mean - field in nature and , therefore , it might be applicable for large enough @xmath161 only .",
    "we have seen , however , in the examples of potts and @xmath2-charge models , that the applicability of the flexible chain limit is controlled by the _ effective _ flexibility , which is considerably smaller than @xmath161 itself .",
    "we therefore consider formally the small @xmath161 limit , leaving the analysis of applicability for each particular case .    in small @xmath161 limit ,",
    "only the first term with @xmath229 is relevant in the series  ( [ eq : cumulexp ] ) . omitting all higher order terms",
    ", we obtain the remarkably simple result @xmath230 where the second cumulant ( variance ) is defined as @xmath231 ^ 2 \\right>$ ] and matrix averages are defined by @xmath232 unlike the stiff chain limit , in the flexible chain case at hand , the freezing transition is controlled mainly by overall heterogeneity of interaction energies @xmath23 .",
    "thus , if one started with an interaction matrix with independent elements and shuffled the matrix elements ( even though it is hard to think of real physical experiment of this kind ) , this transformation would not change the freezing temperature for flexible chains .",
    "this is qualitatively a very natural result , as the nature of flexible chains is such that for any given monomer , many of the neighbors in space are neighbors along the chain . in other words ,",
    "the interaction units are quasi monomers , which are substantially different from the monomers and represent clouds of monomers , where the individuality of each monomer species ( with different patterns of energetical preferences to other species ) is lost .    in the case of the potts and @xmath2-charge models ,",
    "the variance of the interaction matrix yields the flexible chain limits for both the potts  ( [ eq : tfpotts ] ) and @xmath2-charge  ( [ eq : tfpcharge ] ) models .",
    "thus , the solution  ( [ eq : tfvar ] ) for @xmath152 in this limit is remarkably simple and powerful . to demonstrate this",
    ", we show some particular examples .      in the independent interaction model , all @xmath233",
    "are taken independently from gaussian distribution @xmath234 \\label{eq : gaussprob}\\ ] ] ( recall that capital @xmath7 and @xmath14 are related to monomer numbers along the chain and not to species ) . from the physical point of view",
    ", the independence of , say , @xmath233 and @xmath235 can be realized if and only if the total number of different species is very large , i.e. , in the @xmath236 limit .",
    "the effective stiffness in this limit is small , and we have to use the expression  ( [ eq : tfvar ] ) for the freezing temperature .",
    "therefore , @xmath237 .",
    "this indeed coincides with original result of the work @xcite .",
    "it is of special interest to examine the freezing transition for polymers comprised of real amino acids , i.e. , of constituents of real proteins .",
    "this can be done using the matrix of interaction energies derived for amino acids by miyazawa and jernigan @xcite .",
    "we are in a position to examine the freezing transition for random sequences ( even though real protein sequences might not be random @xcite ) . in the work @xcite",
    ", the interaction matrix was given in the form @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the interaction energy and @xmath240 is a temperature not formally defined in @xcite . in some rough approximation , we identify the mj matrix with our @xmath241 . to avoid rewriting of the eq  ( [ eq : finalselfconsist ] ) , we substitute the mj matrix into  ( [ eq : finalselfconsist ] ) instead of @xmath186 , meaning that now @xmath242 .",
    "we assume also equal composition @xmath243 .",
    "we can then numerically calculate the @xmath109 vs @xmath161 dependence .",
    "the result is shown in figure  1 .",
    "note the qualitative similarity of the graph of @xmath109 vs @xmath161 for the mj matrix and @xmath153 vs @xmath161 given by  ( [ eq : xiselfcon ] ) .",
    "given the realistic value of @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) for polypeptide chain , we obtain from the figure  1 the estimate @xmath246 , or @xmath247 . by taking more realistic uneven composition , we arrive at @xmath248 , or @xmath249 .",
    "note that for real amino acids system the relevant solution is generally in the high flexibility regime .    to understand these results ,",
    "recall the way that the mj matrix was derived in @xcite .",
    "the protein @xmath27 structures data bank was employed such that if there were @xmath250 contacts between amino acids labelled as @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the data bank , and the total number of contacts was @xmath251 , then the ratio @xmath252 was interpreted as a probability governed by some effective boltzmann distribution @xmath253 $ ] , thus yielding the mj matrix of energies , @xmath239 . in the later work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the ratio @xmath254 obeys indeed boltzmann type formula if proteins do match the random energy model , and then the parameter of distribution , @xmath240 , is nothing but the freezing temperature , @xmath152 @xcite . from that logic , we expect thus @xmath255 .",
    "our result is slightly higher .",
    "we conclude thus , that there is a reasonable agreement between the works @xcite , @xcite , and our results .",
    "starting from a sequence - model hamiltonian in which interactions between _ species _ of monomers is expressed in terms of some arbitrary symmetric matrix @xmath186 , we have derived a formalism with which to examine the freezing transition of random heteropolymers . as monomer species interactions are given by some matrix , this formulation is the most general form , assuming that interactions are short range and that heteropolymeric contributions come primarily from two - body interactions .",
    "first , we have related the freezing temperature to the interaction matrix self - consistently .",
    "this self - consistent equation can be solved exactly for certain specific systems .",
    "for example , models such as the @xmath0-potts and @xmath2-charge models are important as they describe interesting physical cases , but with only a minimal amount of complexity in their solutions .",
    "it is especially interesting that these two simple models have radically different freezing behavior with respect to the number of species .",
    "clearly simply adding new and different monomer species does not necessarily enhance the freezing transition .    taking another approach ,",
    "we can trade the accuracy of an exact result for the generality of the assumption of only some arbitrary symmetric interaction matrix . to this end",
    ", we solved the exact self - consistent equation perturbatively .",
    "due to the nature of the @xmath153 function , there are two regimes of interest : small @xmath161 ( high effective flexibility ) where @xmath256 and @xmath257 , where @xmath153 approaches a singularity in the self - consistent formulation . expanding at these two limits , we found @xmath258 where @xmath217 is the largest eigenvalue of the @xmath259 matrix .",
    "the equation above quantitatively details certain descriptions of what one could qualitatively call the `` heteropolymeric character '' of the interaction matrix @xmath186 and the species composition @xmath187 .",
    "specifically , for flexible chains , one would expect that the physical unit of interactions , or quasi monomers , consist of several monomers .",
    "the variance of the interaction matrix gives , in a sense , the heteropolymeric width of interactions .",
    "if these interaction energies are ordered in the interaction matrix , however , the correlations between monomer species interactions reduces the heteropolymeric nature of the system , and thus reduces the freezing temperature .    in the limit of stiff chains ,",
    "quasi monomers generally consist of individual monomers .",
    "thus , the specific nature of interactions are of paramount importance . in this limit",
    ", one can imagine the interactions in space ( i.e. not necessarily along the chain ) as interactions propagating through the pairwise interactions of monomer species .",
    "this chain of interactions , in the stiff polymer limit , becomes very long and thus the system shares characteristics with other one - dimensional systems , such as the 1d ising model .",
    "specifically , here the freezing temperature is proportional to the largest eigenvalue , which dominates in the long interaction chain limit , of the transfer matrix @xmath259 .",
    "to conclude , we comment on the applicability of this theory .",
    "three points are to be mentioned here .",
    "first , since we truncate the series  ( [ eq : source_term_series ] ) to @xmath55 , we can not comment on the nature of any phase transitions in the average value of @xmath52 , such as the microphase segregation seen in two letter ferromagnetic interaction matrices @xcite .",
    "second , all calculations have been mean field and therefore effects due to the fluctuations in the order parameter @xmath65 have been neglected . at present , these effects have been examined in one - loop approximation only @xcite . for further details ,",
    "we refer the reader to the discussions in @xcite .",
    "even though the issue remains open , to the best of our understanding at this moment , mean field @xmath260 theory is definitely applicable in the vicinity of freezing transition , at least when the number of monomer species is more than two .",
    "third , and last , we have ignored the possibility of liquid crystalline ordering in the stiff chain regime .",
    "this issue has not been examined at all , we can only guess qualitatively that orientational ordering should be suppressed in strongly non - uniform heteropolymer system compared to a homopolymer of comparable stiffness .",
    "thus , for models with `` heteropolymeric character , '' i.e. , the interaction matrix and probability distribution can not be reduced to that of a homopolymer , our theory predicts a freezing transition .",
    "our formalism facilitates the calculation of specific models of interactions , but perhaps most importantly , the direct relationship between the interaction matrix and the freezing transition is demonstrated .    *",
