    "electron elastic scattering off quantum targets is an important fundamental phenomenon of nature .",
    "it has significance to both the basic and applied sciences and technologies . yet , to date , the knowledge on the process of electron collision with such important quantum targets as endohedral fullerenes @xmath0@c@xmath1 is far from complete .",
    "endohedral fullerenes are nanostructure formations where an atom @xmath0 is encapsulated inside the hollow interior of a c@xmath1 molecule .",
    "the authors are aware of only a handful of works on this subject .",
    "these are the theoretical studies of fast charged - particle ionization of @xmath0@c@xmath1 @xcite and low - energy electron scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 @xcite calculated in the framework of two different model approximations .",
    "namely , in refs .",
    "@xcite a static hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation was employed . there ,",
    "both the atom @xmath0 and c@xmath1 were considered as nonpolarizable targets and the c@xmath1 cage was modeled by an attractive spherical potential of a certain inner radius , thickness , and depth . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors kept the encaged atom `` frozen '' , modeled the c@xmath1 cage by the potential similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but accounted for polarization of the c@xmath1 cage by incident electrons .",
    "the latter was evaluated in a simplified manner by adding a static polarization potential @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the static polarizability of c@xmath1 ) to the model c@xmath1-potential .",
    "note , a meager amount of research on @xmath6 collision is in contrast to the study of photon-@xmath0@c@xmath1 collision , different aspect of which has been intensely scrutinized in a great variety of theoretical works to date ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , including experimental studies @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "such disbalance in favor of the number and quality of studies of @xmath0@c@xmath1 photoionization versus research on electron-@xmath0@c@xmath1 collision is not accidental .",
    "electronic collision with a multielectron target is a more complicated multifaceted process compared to photonic collision with the same target .",
    "therefore , the comprehensive description of electron scattering by a multielectron target is too challenging for theorists even with regard to a free atom , not to mention @xmath0@c@xmath1 targets .",
    "the present study does not aim at solving the difficult problem of electron-@xmath0@c@xmath1 scattering in its entirety .",
    "instead , it focuses on the contribution of electron scattering only off the encapsulated atom @xmath0 to the entire collision process .",
    "the significance of the present study is that it provides an important frame of reference for ( future ) understanding of which part of electron-@xmath0@c@xmath1 scattering could be due to scattering off the encapsulated atom @xmath0 ( unraveled in the present work ) and which is due to other `` facets '' of the entire @xmath0@c@xmath1 system .",
    "research results , thus , provide a relative rather than absolute knowledge . to meet the goal ,",
    "the c@xmath1 cage is modeled , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , by a spherical potential of a certain inner radius , thickness , and depth .",
    "polarization of the c@xmath1 cage by incident electrons will , thus , be ignored ( being not the subject of the focused study ) .",
    "this is in contrast to accounting for polarization of the encapsulated atom in the present study .",
    "the neglect by polarizability of c@xmath1 by incident electrons should not be over - dramatized .",
    "the effect of polarizability is electron - energy - dependent and may either enhance or decrease scattering cross section , at certain electron energies .",
    "therefore , when scattering off c@xmath1 is dramatically decreased , or where scattering of the encapsulated atom @xmath0 is dramatically increased , a relative role of scattering off the atom @xmath0 will ( might ) be significant .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0@c@xmath1 has the hollow interior which is not totally occupied by the atom ( i.e. , not totally filled in with charge density ) .",
    "as such , it acts as a resonator relative to incident electronic waves .",
    "therefore , at wave frequencies , matching resonance frequencies of the @xmath0@c@xmath1-resonator , there will be a significant incident - electron - density build - up in the hollow interior of @xmath0@c@xmath1 .",
    "obviously , this build - up of electron density will be positioned near the encapsulated atom @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the effect of atomic polarization on electron scattering might become comparable or even more important than the c@xmath1 polarization effect , at resonance frequencies .",
    "as such , the impact of atomic polarizability on @xmath6 scattering it can not be dropped out of the consideration at all .",
    "it is , therefore , indisputably needed ( and interesting , and does make sense ) to study how polarization of the encapsulated atom can affect the scattering process even in the neglect by polarization of the fullerene cage by incident electrons . to account for atomic polarization under confinement ,",
    "the authors employ the dyson formalism for the self - energy part of the green s function of a scattered electron @xcite , adapt it to the case of the electron motion in a combined field of the encapsulated multielectron atom @xmath0 and the model static c@xmath1 cage , solve the generalized dyson equation , and , thus , calculate the electron elastic - scattering phase shifts and corresponding cross sections for the @xmath2 scattering reaction .",
    "the study is restricted to electron elastic scattering at low electron energies @xmath7 ev where the most interesting effects occur .",
    "finally , the present study also has a significance which is independent of its direct applicability to electron-@xmath0@c@xmath1 scattering .",
    "this is because it falls into a mainstream of intense modern studies where numerous aspects of the structure and spectra of atoms under various kinds of confinements ( impenetrable spherical , spheroidal , dihedral , debye - like potentials , etc . )",
    "are being attacked from many different angles by research teams world - wide ( see , e.g. , numerous review articles in refs .",
    "such studies are interesting from the view point of basic science .",
    "results of the present study add new knowledge to the collection of atomic properties under confinement as well , particularly revealing the impact of atomic polarization under confinement on electron - atom scattering .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the paper unless specified otherwise .",
    "in the present work , the c@xmath1 cage is modeled by a spherical potential @xmath9 defined as follows : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the inner radius , thickness , and depth of the potential well , respectively .",
    "next , the wavefunctions @xmath14 and binding energies @xmath15 of atomic electrons ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the standard set of quantum numbers of an electron in a central field , @xmath20 is the electron spin variable ) are the solutions of a system of the `` endohedral '' hf equations : @xmath21\\psi_{i } ( { \\bm x } ) + \\sum_{j=1}^{z } \\int{\\frac{\\psi^{*}_{j}({\\bm x'})}{|{\\bm x}-{\\bm x'}| } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times[\\psi_{j}({\\bm x'})\\psi_{i}({\\bm x } ) - \\psi_{i}({\\bm x'})\\psi_{j}({\\bm x})]d { \\bm x ' } = \\epsilon_{i}\\psi_{i}({\\bm x } ) .",

    "( [ eqhf ] ) differs from the ordinary hf equation for a free atom by the presence of the @xmath9 potential in there .",
    "this equation is first solved in order to calculate the electronic ground - state wavefunctions of the encapsulated atom .",
    "once the electronic ground - state wavefunctions are determined , they are plugged back into eq .",
    "( [ eqhf ] ) in place of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in order to calculate the electronic wavefunctions of scattering - states @xmath28 and their radial parts @xmath29 .",

    "in the aims of the present paper , the authors focus on electron scattering off ba@c@xmath1 , as the case study .",
    "this is because the ba atom is a highly polarizable atom .",
    "it is expected to retain its high polarizability under the c@xmath1 confinement as well .",
    "this provides one with a better opportunity to learn how atomic polarization can alter electron scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 compared to scattering off the static target .",
    "furthermore , the study focuses on the electron energy region of up to @xmath88 ev .",
    "first , at such energies , the electron wavelength @xmath89 @xmath90 exceeds greatly the bond length @xmath91 @xmath90 between the carbon atoms in c@xmath1 .",
    "correspondingly , the incoming electrons will `` see '' the c@xmath1 cage as a homogeneous rather than `` granular '' cage .",
    "this makes it appropriate to model the c@xmath1 cage by a non - granular , i.e. , `` smooth '' potential .",
    "moreover , as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , a low - energy electron motion in the field of c@xmath1 is insensitive to details of the `` smooth '' potential , i.e. , to whether the potential is the potential with round borders and unparallel walls or simply a square - well potential , as long as @xmath92 .",
    "this additionally justifies the use of the square - well potential , eq .",
    "( [ swp ] ) , in the present study .",
    "second , correlation / polarization effects , which are of the primary concern of this paper , are expected , as usually , to be most strong primarily at low - energy electron collisions with multielectron targets .",
    "third , at these low energies , earlier , there were predicted spectacular confinement - induced resonances in @xmath2 scattering @xcite , similar to those predicted in @xmath50 scattering @xcite .",
    "the presence of the confining c@xmath1 cage in this case , as well as in the case of scattering off empty c@xmath1 , results in the emergence of positive quasi - discrete states in the field of @xmath0@c@xmath1 or c@xmath1 .",
    "when quasi - discrete states are present , then , in accordance with the known fact , `` ... resonance scattering occurs because a positive level with @xmath93 , though not a true discrete level , is quasi - discrete : owing to the presence of the centrifugal potential barrier , the probability that a particle of low energy will escape from this state to infinity is small , so that the lifetime of the state is long '' @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to explore how the predicted resonances in @xmath2 scattering can be altered by the effects of polarization of the encapsulated atom @xmath0 by incident electrons .",
    "next , the calculations of electron scattering off ba@@xmath94 and free ba , performed in the present work in the framework of both shift and scat , accounted for the monopole , dipole , quadrupole , and octupole perturbations of the valence @xmath95 and @xmath96 subshells of free and encaged ba by incident electrons . finally , in view of low values of the electron energies , only the @xmath97- , @xmath98- , @xmath99- , @xmath100- , and @xmath101-partial electronic waves have been accounted for in the calculations .",
    "the contribution of other partial electronic waves is negligible , at given energies .",
    "corresponding calculated hf , shift , and scat data for the real parts of phase shifts @xmath102 , partial @xmath103 and total @xmath37 cross sections for electron elastic scattering off ba@c@xmath1 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ bac60 ] ( the imaginary parts @xmath104 of the phase shifts , when present , are small at the chosen energies and present little interest for discussion ) .    as an important finding , one learns from fig .",
    "[ bac60 ] that the c@xmath1 confinement does not at all `` extinguish '' the possibility for the encapsulated ba atom to be strongly polarized by incident electrons . on the contrary",
    ", the polarization impact is found to affect dramatically both the electron scattering phase shifts and partial @xmath85 as well as total @xmath83 cross sections .",
    "all this is obvious from the comparison of calculated results obtained in the framework of hf , on the one hand , and shift and scat , on the other hand , approximations . as another important result",
    ", one finds that accounting for only the second - order ( with respect to the coulomb interaction ) correlation effects , as in shift , is important but far insufficient for the calculation of low - energy electron scattering off ba@c@xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the correlation impact beyond the second - order approximation , i.e. , accounted for in the scat approximation , is utterly significant  the lower the energy , the stronger the impact .    for the next , it is both interesting and necessary to bring to the attention of the reader that the _ empty _",
    "static c@xmath1 cage can only support the @xmath97- , @xmath98- , and @xmath99-bound states @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the `` stuffed '' c@xmath1 , i.e. , ba@c@xmath1 , was found to lose a @xmath97-bound state , but acquire , instead , a @xmath100-bound state , in the static hf approximation @xcite .",
    "now , it follows from the present study that by `` unfreezing '' the encapsulated ba atom , i.e. , by making it polarizable , the lost @xmath97-bound state is returned to the ba@c@xmath1 system , and the latter keeps the former @xmath98- , @xmath99- and @xmath100-bound states .",
    "moreover , the ba@c@xmath1 system is found to start supporting a second @xmath98-bound state as well .",
    "all this becomes clear by noting the calculated scat values of the @xmath97- , @xmath98- , @xmath99- , and @xmath100-phase shifts at @xmath105 : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "the zero - energy values of these phase shifts satisfy the generalized version of levinson theorem for scattering in a potential field @xcite which ( the generalized theorem ) could be derived by the direct numerical calculation and written as follows : @xmath110 here , @xmath111 is the number of closed subshells with given @xmath17 in the ground - state configuration of an atom , whereas @xmath112 is the number of additional _ empty _ bound states with the same @xmath17 in the field of @xmath0@c@xmath1 . given that , for the ground - state of the encapsulated ba atom , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , one finds that , in accordance with the scat values of the phase shifts , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "this translates into one @xmath97- , two @xmath98- , one @xmath99- , and one @xmath100-bound states supported ( one at a time ) by ba@c@xmath1 .",
    "note that calculated shift phase shifts , in contrast to scat data , point to the existence of neither @xmath97- nor second @xmath98-bound state in the field of ba@c@xmath1 .",
    "this discrepancy between the calculated shift and scat data speaks , in general , to the importance of a fuller account of electron correlation in the calculation of @xmath39a@xmath40 scattering .",
    "the discovered in the framework of scat emergence of a @xmath97-bound state and a second @xmath98-bound state in the field of ba@c@xmath1 has profound consequences for both the corresponding partial and total electron - scattering cross sections .",
    "namely , because the phase shift @xmath121 , on the way to its value of @xmath122 at @xmath123 , passes through the value of modulo @xmath124 ( at @xmath125 ev ) , @xmath126 becomes large , at lower energies , in contrast to the predictions obtained with the help of inferior hf and shift .",
    "similarly , the increase of @xmath127 to @xmath128 at @xmath129 results in large @xmath130 as well , at low energies , again , in contrast to the predictions by hf and shift .    talking about the @xmath99- and @xmath101-partial cross sections , one can see that each of them is dominated by the strong resonance .",
    "its emergence clearly follows from the behavior of the @xmath99- and @xmath101-phase shifts .",
    "indeed , the phase shifts first tend to increases towards modulo @xmath131 with decreasing energy , but , because the field turns out to be not strong enough , before that value is reached , they sharply decrease , passing through the value of modulo @xmath124 .",
    "this is a typical behavior of phase shifts upon electron scattering on quasibound states @xcite .",
    "next , note how the resonances in the @xmath99- and @xmath101-partial cross sections become higher , narrower , and shift towards lower energy as more correlation is accounted for in the calculation ( compare calculated hf versus shift versus scat results ) .",
    "we thus find that the inclusion of more correlation into the calculation of @xmath87 scattering increases the strength of the field of the ba@c@xmath1-scatterer , since the above noted changes in the resonances are typical for electron scattering in a field of increasing strength @xcite .",
    "next , note that no @xmath100-resonance emerges in @xmath87 scattering calculated in either of the three approximations utilized in this paper .",
    "this is in contrast to electron elastic - scattering off empty static c@xmath1 .",
    "there , the sharp @xmath100-resonance was predicted to emerge at low energies @xcite ( this is the extremely narrow resonance near zero plotted in fig .  [ c60 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the absence of the @xmath100-resonance in @xmath87 scattering is interesting .",
    "it is directly associated with that a noticeable part of the valence electronic charge - density of encapsulated ba is drawn into the c@xmath1 shell @xcite .",
    "therefore , the field inside the `` stuffed '' c@xmath1 becomes more attractive than in empty c@xmath1 .",
    "it turns the @xmath100-state into a bound state , thereby eliminating the emergence of a @xmath100-resonance in @xmath87 scattering .",
    "now , as it has been shown in the paragraph above , the inclusion of correlation into the calculation of @xmath87 scattering increases the field of ba@c@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath100-state remains bound .",
    "this is why the @xmath100-resonance does not take place in @xmath87 scattering even if polarization of the encapsulated ba atom by incident electrons is accounted for in the calculation .",
    "our general prediction is that there will be no @xmath100-resonances on quasibound states in electron scattering off any @xmath0@c@xmath1 system in case where there is a noticeable transfer of electronic charge - density from the encapsulated atom to the c@xmath1 shell .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to compare how much differently polarization of the ba atom by incident electrons affects electron elastic scattering off free ba versus ba@c@xmath1 . the corresponding calculated hf and scat total electron elastic - scattering cross sections",
    "are depicted in fig .",
    "[ bavsbac60 ] .",
    "the calculated data reveal a spectacular difference between the role of polarization in electron scattering off ba and ba@c@xmath1 .",
    "namely , it appears that the effects of polarization in @xmath87 scattering act oppositely to the effects in @xmath132 scattering .",
    "thus , whereas @xmath133 at @xmath134",
    "ev , the situation is exact opposite for @xmath87 scattering in about the same energy region : @xmath135 . alternatively , whereas @xmath136 at @xmath137 ev , one observes that @xmath138 in there .",
    "it is , thus , found in the present study that the effects of atomic polarization in electron scattering off the free and encapsulated inside c@xmath1 atoms may follow opposite routes .",
    "this is an interesting observation .",
    "lastly , note that there are energy regions , specifically , @xmath139 ev and @xmath140 ev , where @xmath141 .",
    "this means that the gas - medium of big - sized @xmath142s can be more transparent to incident electrons than the gas - medium of smaller - sized isolated atoms @xmath0 themselves .",
    "this counter - intuitive effect was earlier unveiled in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the static hf approximation , but appears to retain its place even if the encapsulated atom is polarizable , as is shown in the present paper .",
    "the present work has provided a deeper insight into possible features of low - energy electron elastic scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 fullerenes .",
    "this has been achieved by studying the dependence of @xmath87 elastic scattering with account for polarization of encapsulated ba by incident electrons .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the polarization effect results in dramatic differences between electron scattering off ba@c@xmath1 evaluated with and without inclusion of polarization into the calculation .",
    "it has been found that a fuller account for correlation effects in @xmath143 scattering is utterly important .",
    "furthermore , it has been unraveled in the present study that the impact of polarization on electron scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 may be both qualitatively and quantitatively different than that in the case of electron scattering by the free atom @xmath0 . for instance , it has been demonstrated that where polarization significantly enhances the @xmath87 scattering cross section , it significantly diminishes the @xmath132 scattering cross section and vice verse .",
    "this leads to the possibility for electron scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 to become significantly weaker than in the case of electron scattering by the isolated atom @xmath0 , in certain energy regions .",
    "this counter - intuitive effect has been found to be stronger and occur in a broader energy region than when polarization is ignored .",
    "lastly , the present study provides researchers with background information which is useful for future studies of electron scattering by @xmath0@c@xmath1 , particularly aimed at elucidating of a possible significance of a simultaneous polarization of both the c@xmath1 cage and encaged atom by incident electrons .",
    "this will make the @xmath0@c@xmath1 more attractive , so that predicted in the present study features of @xmath2 may appear at different energies , or disappear at all , some actual bound states may be converted to resonances , etc .",

    "<S> the present paper explores possible features of electron elastic scattering off endohedral fullerenes @xmath0@c@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it focuses on how dynamical polarization of the encapsulated atom @xmath0 by an incident electron might alter scattering off @xmath0@c@xmath1 compared to the static - atom-@xmath0 case , as well as how the c@xmath1 confinement modifies the impact of atomic polarization on electron scattering compared to the free - atom case . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to provide researchers with a `` relative frame of reference '' for understanding which part of the scattering processes could be due to electron scattering off the encapsulated atom and which due to scattering off the c@xmath1 cage . to meet the goal , </S>",
    "<S> the c@xmath1 cage is modeled by an attractive spherical potential of a certain inner radius , thickness , and depth which is a model used frequently in a great variety of fullerene studies to date . </S>",
    "<S> then , the dyson equation for the self - energy part of the green s function of an incident electron moving in the combined field of an encapsulated atom @xmath0 and c@xmath1 is solved in order to account for the impact of dynamical polarization of the encaged atom upon @xmath2 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the ba@c@xmath1 endohedral is chosen as the case study . </S>",
    "<S> the impact is found to be significant , and its utterly different role compared to that in @xmath3 scattering is unraveled . </S>"
