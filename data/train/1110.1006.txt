    "returns in financial time series are the most fundamental inputs to quantitative finance . to a certain extend ,",
    "they provide some insights in the the dynamical content of the market . in this letter",
    ", we consider several financial series on futures , using always a five minutes sampling .",

    "we know that the distribution of log - returns @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 , can be written quite generally as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an objective function and @xmath8 a normalization factor . in particular , it can be shown easily that @xmath7 can be derived by minimizing a generating functional @xmath9 $ ] , subject to some constraints on the mean value of the objective function .",
    "it reads @xmath10\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "in addition , the expression given in eq .",
    "( [ ini ] ) for the probability distribution can also be seen as the outcome of an equation of motion for @xmath4 . from eq .",
    "( [ ini ] ) and ( [ ini2 ] ) , we can express the stochastic process @xmath4 as a markovian process of the form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a gaussian process satisfying @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 depends only on @xmath4 . adopting the it convention @xcite ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath18 , associated with this equation of motion ( eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) , is given by the following fokker - planck equation @xmath19 - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } [ f(x ) p(x , t)]\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , we can finally extract the stationary solution for @xmath5 in the form of eq .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) can be related to real data on financial markets is not granted .",
    "therefore , we need to compare predictions derived from these equations to real data .",
    "as mentioned above , we use financial time series on different futures , using a five minutes sampling .",
    "in eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not specified and any choice can be considered .",
    "obviously , only specific choices will have a chance to get a reasonable agreement with real data .",
    "for example , let us consider three cases :    * if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath23 , and thus we predict a gaussian shape for the log - returns distribution .",
    "* in the more general case where @xmath24 and @xmath17 is not constant , we obtain @xmath25 and thus we predict non - gaussian shape for the log - returns distribution .",
    "* let us specify the case ( ii ) .",
    "introducing a constant @xmath26 and defining the two functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we get @xmath29 in this scenario @xmath5 follows the so - called t - distribution .",
    "it depends on one parameter @xmath26 to be fitted on real data , for normalized log - returns .",
    "let us notice that eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) is equivalent to the q - exponential form of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath30 where we have conserved the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite . obviously , eq . ( [ nu ] ) and ( [ q ] )",
    "are directly related by @xmath31 . in particular , @xmath1 is equivalent to @xmath32 .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] , we present the log - returns @xmath33 ( five minutes sampling ) for a large set of futures . to make the comparison ,",
    "we have scaled @xmath33 for all futures to the volatility of the dax future ( fdax ) . on the left hand side ( lhs ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we observe that futures on dax , bund , yen , euro , gold present the same probability distribution for @xmath33 , hence @xmath5 is universal for all these data series once the volatility is normalized to the same value . on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we provide comparisons with futures on commodities .",
    "we observe that data series on cl ( crude oil ) follows the same @xmath5 as fdax , but other data series on wheat and ng ( natual gaz ) exhibit some larger tails .",
    "we can use results developed in section [ param ] in order to compare with experimental distributions @xmath5 of fig .",
    "we use predictions exposed in cases ( i ) and ( iii ) , respectively the gaussian and the q - exponential forms ( or t - distribution ) .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for data",
    ", we only display @xmath5 for fdax .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show that the q - exponential probability distribution of eq .",

    "let us notice that futures with larger tails discussed above correspond to smaller values of @xmath26 . also , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the gaussian approximation fails to describe properly the data . on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we observe that when @xmath26 is increased above @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) , then @xmath5 stands in the middle of the correct probability density and the gaussian approximation .",
    "when @xmath26 tends to infinity , the t - distribution recovers the gaussian limit .",
    "from the theory point of view , the probability distribution of log - returns of financial time series , sampled at high frequency , can be expressed quite generally as @xmath35 . in this expression",
    ", the function @xmath7 can be derived using the formalism of stochastic differential equations applied to quantitative finance .",
    "several cases have been considered in this letter .",
    "then , we have shown that real data ( with normalized log - returns ) are compatible with a distribution of the form @xmath36 we have exemplified this property on a sample of data sets . however , this is a quite general result that stays robust on a larger set of financial data as well as on a wide range of sampling frequency of these data , below one hour . interestingly also , this probability distribution corresponds to the equation of motion eq .",
