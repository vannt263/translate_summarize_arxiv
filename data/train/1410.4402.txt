    "since an unexpected and brilliant discovery of high-@xmath2 superconductivity in cuprates in 1986 @xcite ,  experts have been trying to find the origin of superconductivity in them , but in vain .",
    "there are several problems that are interconnected and probably can not be solved independently .",
    "but they are so complex that researchers are forced to consider them separately in order to find the key concepts and express key ideas explaining the huge totality of experimental data .",
    "general discussion and the analysis of high-@xmath2-oxide superconductivity can be found in comprehensive reviews @xcite . in particular , the main questions to be solved",
    "are as follows : ( i ) is superconductivity in cuprates a conventional one based on the cooper pairing concept ?",
    "( ii ) if the answer to the first question is positive , what is the mechanism of superconductivity , i.e. , what are the virtual bosons that glue electrons in pairs ? ( iii ) which is the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter ?",
    "this question remains unanswered , although the majority of the researchers in the field think believe that the problem is already resolved ( namely , @xmath3-one , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) ? ( iv ) what is the role of the intrinsic disorder and non - stoichiometry in the superconducting properties @xcite ? ( v ) what is the origin of the symmetry loss and , specifically , the emerging nematicity @xcite ? ( vi ) what is the origin of the so - called pseudogap @xcite ? ( vii ) what is the role of spin- and charge- density waves ( sdws and cdws ) both in the normal and superconducting states of cuprates ?",
    "the role of various electron spectrum instabilities competing with the cooper pairing below the critical temperature @xmath2 is a part of the more general problem : how can certain anomalous high-@xmath2 oxide properties above @xmath4 be explained , e.g. , the linear behavior of the resistivity @xcite ? in this connection , a quite reasonable viewpoint was expressed that if one understands the normal state of cuprates , the superconducting state properties will be perceived @xcite . here , it is also worth to mention a possible failure @xcite  of the fermi liquid concept belonging to landau @xcite  and the role of strong electron correlations @xcite .    during last decades",
    "we have been developing a phenomenological theory to elucidate the influence of cdws on superconductivity of high-@xmath2 oxides , since the cdws were observed in a number of those materials @xcite .",
    "we identified the cdw energy gap with the pseudogap mentioned above .",
    "such an identification is based , in particular , on the appearance of cdws only below the approximate border of the pseudogapped region  in la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 @xcite  and yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the symmetry of the pseudogap order parameter ( isotropic ) differs from that for the superconducting one ( @xmath3 ) in bi@xmath8sr@xmath8cacuo@xmath11 @xcite , superconductivity in bi@xmath8sr@xmath5la@xmath12cuo@xmath13  emerges with doping when the ( nodal ) pseudogap disappears @xcite , the pseudogap competes with the superconducting gap at antinodes in ( bi , pb)@xmath8(sr , la)@xmath8cuo@xmath13 @xcite , and the interplay of pseudogapping and superconductivity among different members of the oxide family ( ca@xmath14la@xmath15)(ba@xmath16la@xmath17)cu@xmath18o@xmath19 is not the same for varying dopings @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is worthy of note that both angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunnel microscopy ( stm ) experiments allow one to measure only overall energy gaps whatever their microscopic origin .",
    "that is why it is usually difficult to distinguish for sure between superconducting , sdw , and cdw gaps even in the case when they manifest themselves separately in certain momentum ranges each @xcite .    as for direct experiments confirming the existence of cdws competing with superconductivity in cuprates , cdws",
    "have been shown to be a more important factor in this sense than sdws , the remnants of which survive far from the antiferromagnetic state appropriate to zero - doped samples of superconducting families @xcite .",
    "it is useful to shortly summarize the main new findings in this area .",
    "x - ray scattering experiments in yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath21  revealed the cdw ordering at temperatures lower than those of the pseudogap formation , giant phonon anomalies , and elastic central peak induced by nanodomain cdws @xcite . the cdw correlation length increases with the temperature , @xmath22 ,  lowering .",
    "however , the competing superconducting order parameter , which emerges below @xmath2 , so depresses cdws that the true cdw long - range order does not develop , as was shown by raman scattering @xcite .",
    "suppression of cdws by cooper pairing was also found in x - ray measurements of la@xmath23sr@xmath14cuo@xmath7  @xcite .    the well - known cdw manifestations in bi@xmath8sr@xmath5la@xmath14cuo@xmath24",
    "were recently confirmed by complex x - ray , arpes , and stm  studies @xcite .",
    "those authors associate cdws with pseudogapping , but argue that the cdw wave vector connects the fermi arc tips rather than the antinodal fermi surface ( fs ) sections , as stems from the peierls - insulator scenario @xcite .",
    "this conclusion , if being true , makes the whole picture even more enigmatic than in the conventional density - wave approach to pseudogaps either in the mean - field approximation or taking into account fluctuations .",
    "the electron - hole asymmetric cdw ordering was demonstrated by stm and resonant elastic x - ray scattering measurements @xcite for bi@xmath25sr@xmath8cacuo@xmath11 samples , with the pseudogapping in the antinodal momentum region . as was shown in those experiments , cdws and concomitant periodic crystal lattice distortions ,",
    "plds can be observed directly , whereas their interplay with superconductivity manifestations can be seen only indirectly , e.g. , as anticorrelations between @xmath2 and the structural , @xmath26 , or cdw , @xmath27 , transition temperature.(there is a viewpoint @xcite that the strong interrelation between electronic cdw modulations and plds @xcite , inherent , e.g. , to the peierls model of the structural phase transition @xcite , does not exist , and plds can emerge without electronic contributions , which seems strange in the context of indispensable coulomb forces . ) .",
    "this fact is well known , say , for superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite or pseudoternary systems ( lu@xmath15sc@xmath14)@xmath28ir@xmath7si@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems interesting to propose such studies of superconducting properties , which would demonstrate manifestations of cdw existence , although the cdw gapping is an insulating rather than a superconducting one . in a number of publications",
    ", we suggested that certain measurements of the stationary josephson critical current , @xmath0 , between quasi - two - dimensional cdw superconductors with the @xmath3 order parameter symmetry ( inherent to cuprates ) can conspicuously reveal such dependences that would reflect cdw gapping as well or at least demonstrate that the actual gapping symmetry differs from the pure @xmath3 one@xcite .",
    "below , we present further theoretical studies in this direction , which put forward even more effective experiments .",
    "following the dominating idea ( see our previous publications @xcite and references therein ) concerning the electron spectrum of high-@xmath2 oxides identified as partially gapped cdw superconductors , cdwss , we restrict our consideration to the two - dimensional case with the corresponding fs shown in fig .  1a .",
    "the superconducting @xmath1-wave order parameter @xmath30 is assumed to span the whole fs , whereas the @xmath31-wave mean - field dielectric ( cdw ) order parameter @xmath32 develops only on the nested ( dielectrized , d ) fs sections .",
    "there are @xmath33 or 2 of the latter ( the checkerboard and unidirectional configurations , respectively ) , and they are connected in pairs by the cdw - vectors @xmath34 s in the momentum space .",
    "the non - nested sections remain non - dielectrized ( nd ) .",
    "the orientations of @xmath34 s are assumed to be fixed with respect to the crystal lattice . in particular , they are considered to be directed along the @xmath35- and @xmath36-axes in the momentum space ( anti - nodal nesting ) @xcite . the same orientation along @xmath35- and @xmath37-axes is also appropriate to @xmath30-lobes , so that we confine ourselves to the @xmath3-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter as the only one found in the experiments for cuprates .",
    "hence , the profile of the @xmath1-wave superconducting order parameter over the fs is written down in the form @xmath38 the function @xmath39 is the @xmath22-dependent magnitude of the superconducting gap , and the angular factor @xmath40 looks like @xmath41    in the case @xmath33 , the experimentally measured magnitudes of the cdw order parameter @xmath32 in high-@xmath2 oxides are identical in all four cdw sectors , and the corresponding sector - connecting @xmath34 vectors are oriented normally to each other .",
    "therefore , we assume the cdws to possess the four- ( the checkerboard configuration ) or the two - fold ( the unidirectional configuration ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the latter is frequently associated with the electronic nematic , smectic or more complex ordering @xcite).the opening angle of each cdw sector , where @xmath42 , equals @xmath43 . such a profile of @xmath32 over the fs can also be described in the factorized form as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath22-dependent cdw order parameter , and the angular  factor @xmath46{lll}% 1 & \\mathrm{for~}\\left\\vert \\theta - k\\omega\\right\\vert < \\alpha & \\text{\\textrm{(d section),}}\\\\ 0 & \\mathrm{otherwise } & \\text{\\textrm{(nd section).}}% \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{fsigma(teta)}%\\ ] ] here , @xmath47 is an integer number , and the parameter @xmath48 for @xmath33 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the both gapping mechanisms ( superconducting and cdw - driven ) suppress each other , because they compete for the same quasiparticle states near the fs . as a result , a combined gap ( the gap rose in the momentum space , see fig .",
    "1b ) @xmath51 arises on the fs .",
    "the actual @xmath39- and @xmath45-values are determined from a system of self - consistent equations .",
    "the relevant initial parameters , besides @xmath52 and @xmath53 , include the constants of superconducting and electron - hole couplings recalculated into the pure bcs ( no cdws ) and cdw ( no superconductivity ) limiting cases as the corresponding @xmath54 and @xmath55 order parameters at @xmath56 .",
    "it should be emphasized that our model is a simplified , generic one , because real cdws are complex objects , which behave differently on the crystal surfaces and in the bulk @xcite .",
    "thus , it is quite natural that they are not identical for various high-@xmath2 oxides @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the presented model allows the main features of the materials concerned to be taken into account . for brevity",
    ", we mark the cdw @xmath1-wave superconductor with @xmath52 cdw sectors as @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath31-wave bcs superconductor is described in the framework of the standard bcs theory .",
    "its characteristic parameter is the value of the corresponding superconducting order parameter @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "also for the sake of brevity , it will be marked below as @xmath60 .    in the tunnel hamiltonian approximation ,",
    "the stationary josephson critical current is given by the formula @xcite@xmath61 here , @xmath62 are the tunnel hamiltonian matrix elements , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the transferred momenta ; @xmath65 is the elementary electrical charge , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are gorkov green s functions for superconductors to the left and to the right , respectively , from the tunnel barrier ( hereafter , all primed quantities are associated with the right hand side electrode ) .",
    "the internal summation is carried out over the discrete fermionic frequencies  @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "below , we consider tunnel junctions of two types : symmetric @xmath70 between two identical cdwss , and nonsymmetric @xmath71 between a cdws as the left electrode and an @xmath31-wave bcs superconductor as the right one ( here , @xmath72 stands for the insulator ) .",
    "expressions for the corresponding green s functions can be found elsewhere @xcite . since cdws electrodes are anisotropic , their orientations with respect to the junction plane will be characterized by the angles @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( the latter appears only in the symmetric case ) , i.e. the deflections of the positive  @xmath30- and @xmath75-lobes from the normal @xmath76 to the junction ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "accordingly , the angular dependences @xmath40 and @xmath77 of the corresponding order parameters ( see formulas ( [ fdelta(teta ) ] ) and ( [ fsigma(teta ) ] , respectively ) should be modified by changing @xmath78 to @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "an important issue while calculating the josephson current is tunnel directionality @xcite , which should be taken into consideration in the tunnel hamiltonian @xmath62 . indeed",
    ", if we calculate @xmath0 between , e.g. , pure bcs @xmath1-wave superconductors , @xmath81 , making no allowance for this factor , formula ( [ icgen ] ) would produce an exact zero .",
    "it is so because , owing to the alternating signs of superconducting lobes , the current contributions from the fs points described by the angles @xmath78 and @xmath82 would exactly compensate each other in this case .",
    "the same situation also takes place in the case of a junction with @xmath83 . for a junction with @xmath84 ,",
    "it is not so , but , in the framework of the general approach , we have to introduce tunnel directionality in this case as well .    here , we briefly consider three factors responsible for tunnel directionality ( see a more thorough discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . first",
    ", the velocity component normal to the junction should be taken into account .",
    "this circumstance is reflected by the @xmath85-factor in the integrand and an angle - independent factor that can be incorporated into the junction normal - state resistance @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "second , superconducting pairs that cross the barrier at different angles penetrate through barriers with different effective widths @xcite ( the height of the junction barrier is assumed to be much larger than the relevant quasiparticle energies , so that this height may be considered constant ) . since the actual @xmath78-dependences of @xmath62  for realistic junctions are not known , we simulate the barrier - associated directionality by the phenomenological function@xmath87   , \\label{wdirect}%\\ ] ] this means that the effective opening of relevant tunnel angles equals @xmath88 .",
    "the barrier transparency is normalized by the maximum value obtained for the normal tunneling with respect to the junction plane and included into the junction resistance @xmath86 .",
    "hence , @xmath89 . the multiplier @xmath90 in ( [ wdirect ] )",
    "was selected to provide @xmath91 .",
    "third , we use the model of coherent tunneling @xcite , when the superconducting pairs are allowed to tunnel between the points on the fss of different electrodes characterized by the same angle @xmath78 .    as a result of the standard calculation procedure @xcite applied to formula ( [ icgen ] ) and in the framework of the approximations made above",
    ", we obtain the following formula for the stationary josephson critical current across the tunnel junction:@xmath92 where @xcite@xmath93 here , for brevity , we omitted the arguments in the dependences @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "integration over @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ icgen ] ) is carried out within the interval @xmath98 , i.e. over the fs semicircle  turned towards the junction plane .",
    "if any directionality and cdw gapping are excluded ( so that the integration over @xmath78 is reduced to a factor of @xmath49 ) and the angular factors @xmath99 and @xmath100 remain preserved , we arrive at the sigrist  rice model @xcite .",
    "the influence of various problem parameters on the critical stationary josephson curent in the symmetric , @xmath70 , and nonsymmetric , @xmath101 , junctions was analyzed in detail in works @xcite . here",
    ", we attract attention to the problem of cdw detection in high-@xmath2 oxides .",
    "the number of problem parameters can be diminished by normalizing the order parameter  quantities by one of them .",
    "for such a normalization , we selected the parameter @xmath54 and introduced the dimensionless order parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( for the superconducting order parameter of cdws , @xmath104 ) . with regard to experimental needs",
    ", we also introduced the reduced temperature @xmath105 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the actual critical temperature of the cdws . in the framework of our theory ,",
    "it has to be found from the system of equations for the cdws indicated above . for the josephson current amplitude @xmath0",
    ", we introduced the dimensionless combination @xmath106 .",
    "one more preliminary remark concerns the parameter of effective tunnel directionality @xmath107 ( see formula ( [ wdirect ] ) ) .",
    "our calculations @xcite showed that its choice is very important . on the one hand , large values of this parameter correspond to thin junctions and large values of the tunnel current , which is beneficial for the experiment .",
    "however , in this case , the predicted phenomena become effectively smoothed out up to their disappearance . on the other hand ,",
    "narrow tunnel cones ( small @xmath107-values ) provide well pronounced effects , but correspond to thick interelectrode layers and , as a result , small tunnel currents .",
    "hence , in the real experiment , a reasonable compromise should be found between those two extremes .      while examining fig .",
    "2 , it becomes clear that the clearest way to prove that electrons in high-@xmath2 oxides undergo an additional pairing of some origin besides the @xmath1-wave bcs one is to demonstrate that the gap rose differs from that in the @xmath108 superconductor .",
    "the case in question concerns pairing symmetries , which may be different from the @xmath1-wave one or / and extend over only certain fs regions . in the framework of the tunnel technique , the most direct way to perform the search is to fix one electrode and rotate the other one ( e.g. , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) . in the case of @xmath111 junction ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath112 dependences are known to have a cosine profile stemming from dependence ( [ fdelta(teta ) ] ) for the superconducting order parameter @xmath30 and , since any other gapping is absent , for the corresponding gap rose ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "any deviations of the gap rose from this behavior will testify in favor of the existence of additional order parameter(s ) .",
    "certainly , averaging the current over the fs will smooth the relevant peculiarities and making allowance for tunnel directionality will distort them .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed method will be sufficient to detect the competing pairing without its ultimate identification .    in fig .  3 ,",
    "the corresponding normalized @xmath112 dependences calculated for the symmetric s@xmath114s@xmath115 junction and the cdw geometries @xmath50 and 4 , as well as the reference @xmath1-wave bcs curve , are shown .",
    "the tunnel directionality parameter @xmath116 was assumed .",
    "a more detailed analysis of @xmath112 dependences and their relations with other problem parameters can be found in work @xcite .",
    "the results obtained testify that the formulated task is feasible .",
    "an attractive feature of this technique is that , instead of the fixed @xmath57 electrode , we may use the @xmath117 one as well , which might be more convenient from the experimental point of view .",
    "the measurement of the temperature dependences of the critical josephson tunnel current @xmath118 seems to be the most easily realizable method of those proposed in this work . the dependence @xmath118 in the symmetric @xmath119 junctions has a monotonic convex shape . among other things ,",
    "this fact is associated with the constant sign of order parameter over the whole fs . however , in the case of symmetric @xmath120 junctions , the situation may change .",
    "indeed , for junctions involving yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 , nonmonotonic @xmath118-dependences and even the change of @xmath0 sign , i.e. the transformation of the 0-junction into the @xmath49-one or vice versa were observed @xcite .",
    "such a phenomenon was not found for other cuprates .",
    "however , it is extremely difficult to produce josephson junctions made of other materials than yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , further technological breakthrough is needed to make sure that the non - monotonic behavior is a general phenomenon inherent to all high-@xmath2 oxides with @xmath1-wave superconducting order parameter .",
    "it should be noted that , in the measurements concerned , the electrodes remained fixed , so that the peculiar behavior of @xmath118 could not result from the change of overlapping between the superconducting lobes with different signs .",
    "there is an explanation based on the existence of the bound states in the junction due to the andreev  saint - james effect @xcite .",
    "this theory predicts that the current @xmath118 between @xmath1-wave superconductors must exhibit a singularity at @xmath121 .",
    "nevertheless , the latter has not been observed experimentally until now . probably , this effect is wiped out by the roughness of the interfaces in the oxide junctions @xcite and therefore may be of academic interest .",
    "earlier we suggested a different scenario @xcite .",
    "namely , we showed that , at some relative orientations of @xmath122 junction electrodes , one of them can play a role of differential detector , which enables tiny effects connected with the thermally induced repopulation of quasiparticle levels near the fs to be observed . in our approach ,",
    "no zero-@xmath22 singularity of the current could arise .",
    "a similar situation takes place for cdwss . although we can not assign a definite sign to the combined gap  @xmath123 ( see eq .",
    "( [ d(t_teta ) ] ) , the corresponding unambiguously signed @xmath30 enters the expression for the calculation of @xmath0 ( formulas ( [ icgen ] ) and [ p(t ) ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "the fs of the cdws remembers  the specific @xmath30-sign at every of its points and , thus , can also serve as a differential detector of the current at definite electrode orientations . as a result , the dependences @xmath118 both for symmetric @xmath124 and nonsymmetric @xmath125 junctions",
    "can also by nonmonotonic and even sign - changing functions . unlike the @xmath111 junctions , for which the @xmath118-behavior could depend only on the orientation angles of both electrodes ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , now the other parameters responsible for the superconducting and combined gaps  these are @xmath126 and @xmath53become relevant . in figs .  4 and 5 ,",
    "the @xmath127 dependences are shown for various fixed @xmath53 and @xmath126 , respectively , both for the checkerboard  and unidirectional  cdw geometry .",
    "we would like to attract attention to the fact that those dependences are rather sensitive to the electrode orientations ( see the relevant illustration in fig .",
    "6 ) , so that it might be laborious to find a suitable experimental configuration .",
    "the key issue is that the parameters @xmath126 and/or @xmath53 can be ( simultaneously ) varied by doping .",
    "hence , doping cdws electrodes and keeping their orientations fixed , we could change even the character of the @xmath128 dependence : monotonic , nonmonotonic , and sign - changing .",
    "provided the corresponding set of parameters , we could transform the same junction , say , from the 0-state into the @xmath49-one by varying the temperature only .",
    "now , let the electrode orientations be fixed by the experimentalist @xcite and the temperature be zero ( for simplicity ) , but the both parameters @xmath53 and @xmath126 can be varied ( by doping ) . in figs .  7 and 8 ,",
    "the dependences of the dimensionless order parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 on @xmath53 and @xmath126 are exhibited for both analyzed cdw structures .",
    "one can see that , in every cross - section @xmath131 or @xmath132 , both @xmath133 and @xmath134 profiles are monotonic . at first glance",
    ", the josephson tunnel current should also demonstrate such a behavior .",
    "however , our previous calculations @xcite showed that it is so when the orientations of @xmath57 electrodes in the @xmath135 junction are close or rotated by about 90@xmath136 with respect to each other , i.e. when the superconducting lobes strongly overlap in the momentum space and make contributions of the same sign to the current .",
    "but if they are oriented in such a way that mutually form a kind of differential detector for monitoring the states at the gapped and non - gapped fs sections , contributions with different signs cancel each other and more tiny effects become observable . such a conclusion can already be made from figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "really , as is illustrated by figs .",
    "7 and 8 , in the limiting cases@xmath137 for both kinds of cdws , and , if @xmath138 ( here , @xmath139 is the euler constant ) , @xmath140 at @xmath33 or @xmath141 at @xmath50 @xcite  we have @xmath142 . then , according to formulas ( [ icgen ] ) and [ p(t ) ] ) , @xmath0 also vanishes .",
    "therefore , if the current crosses the point @xmath143 at some values of parameters @xmath53 or @xmath126 different from their limiting ones , ( i )  the current behavior becomes nontrivial , because larger values of @xmath53 and @xmath126 , which are accompanied by smaller values of the superconducting order parameter @xmath144 , lead to the current enhancement .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath53 or @xmath126 grows further towards its corresponding limiting values , the current must sooner or later begin to decrease by the absolute value .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by figs .  9 and 10 , where the dependences @xmath145 and @xmath146 at @xmath56 are shown .",
    "while analyzing those figures , the following consideration should be taken into account .",
    "namely , we suppose that gradual doping monotonically affects the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath126 of @xmath57 superconductors .",
    "specific calculations ( figs .  9 and 10 )",
    "were made assuming that only one of the control parameters , @xmath53 or @xmath126 , changes , which is most likely not true in the real experiment .",
    "however , the presented results testify that each of those parameters differently affects the current . moreover , underdoping is usually accompanied by the increase of both @xmath53 and @xmath32 ( proportional to the structural phase transition temperature , i.e. the pseudogap appearance temperature , @xmath147 ) @xcite",
    ". therefore , the situation when the doping - induced simultaneous changes in the values of @xmath53 and @xmath55 would lead to their mutual compensation seems improbable .",
    "accordingly , we believe that the proposed experiments may be useful in one more , this time indirect , technique to probe cdws in high-@xmath2 oxides . in particular , the oscillating dependences @xmath148 depicted in fig .  10b",
    ", if reproduced in the experiment , will be certain to prove the interplay between the superconducting order parameter and another , competing , one ; here , the latter is considered theoretically to be associated with cdws .",
    "in the two - dimensional model appropriate for cuprates , we calculated the dependences of the stationary critical josephson tunnel current @xmath0 in junctions involving @xmath1-wave superconductors with cdws on the temperature , the cdw parameters , and the electrode orientation angles with respect to the junction plane .",
    "it was shown that the intertwining of the cdw and superconducting order parameters leads to peculiar dependences of @xmath0 , which reflect the existence of cdw gapping .",
    "the peculiarities become especially salient when the crystal configurations on the both sides of the sandwich make the overall current extremely sensitive to the overlap between the superconducting lobes and the cdw sectors . in this case , the whole structure can be considered as a differential tool suitable to detect cdws .",
    "doping serves here as a control process to reveal the cdw manifestations .",
    "such configurations have already been created for yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 @xcite and may be used to check the predictions of our theory .    the work was partially supported by the project n  8 of the 20122014 scientific cooperation agreement between poland and ukraine .",
