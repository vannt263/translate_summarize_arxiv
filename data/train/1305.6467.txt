    "the experimental evidence for neutrino mass , acquired in recent decades , provides concrete evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although the requisite new degrees of freedom can not yet be determined it is clear that additional particles are likely to exist , in order to generate the masses .",
    "similarly , there is by now a large amount of evidence for an additional galactic constituent , an unknown substance referred to as dark matter ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this may or may not require new degree s of freedom , but the hypothesis that the dark matter is comprised of a stable ( or long lived ) new particle species provides a simple explanation for this observed feature of the universe . given that these two indicators for beyond - sm physics can be explained by extending the particle spectrum of the sm , it is natural to ask if the requisite new particles can be related .",
    "could the mechanism of neutrino mass be related to the existence of a stable dark - matter candidate ?",
    "a particularly simple model realizing this idea was proposed by ma in 2006  @xcite .",
    "this model extends the sm to include an additional sm - like scalar doublet and gauge - singlet fermions , all of which are odd under a discrete @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the extended field content allows for radiative neutrino mass , generated at the one - loop level , while the lightest beyond - sm field is absolutely stable .",
    "one thus arrives at a simple synergetic model of radiative neutrino mass and dark matter .    in this work",
    "we generalize ma s approach .",
    "we present a class of related models , all of which generate neutrino mass via a loop diagram with the same topography as ma s , whilst simultaneously admitting stable dark - matter candidates .",
    "the loop - diagram employed by ma contains a mass insertion on the internal fermion line ( see figure  [ fig : yukawa_loop ] ) , and our generalizations fall naturally into two categories ; those which break lepton - number symmetry via a majorana mass insertion , and those with a dirac mass insertion , such that lepton - number symmetry is broken at a vertex .",
    "although the basic mechanism is very similar in both cases , this difference modifies one s expectations for the beyond - sm field content and the associated phenomenology .",
    "it turns out that , in both cases , this approach is very general and many realizations are possible .",
    "however , restricting attention to models in which the beyond - sm multiplets are no larger than the adjoint representation significantly reduces the possibilities .",
    "as we shall see , there are only two such ( minimal ) models with a majorana mass - insertion , both of which are known  @xcite .",
    "we find seven additional models with a mass insertion of the dirac type , all of which achieve radiative neutrino mass and dark - matter candidates .",
    "we detail these models , finding a subset that are compatible with direct - detection experiments .",
    "there are cases with an inert singlet , an inert doublet , and an inert triplet ; the models therefore provide a natural setting for inert @xmath0-tuplet theories of dark matter , such that radiative neutrino mass is also achieved .",
    "interestingly , three of the new models admit a simple extension that can explain the origin of the ( formerly imposed ) discrete symmetry . by upgrading the discrete symmetry to a gauged @xmath5 symmetry , and extending the field content by a single sm - singlet scalar ,",
    "the discrete symmetry can arise as an accidental symmetry of the low - energy lagrangian , after @xmath5 symmetry breaking takes place .",
    "this provides a simple explanation for the discrete symmetry .",
    "though we focus on models with representations no larger than the adjoint , we also briefly discuss cases where the beyond - sm fields can be quadruplet and/or quintuplet representations of @xmath6 .",
    "we present the candidate models in these cases , and mention some key issues , based on the lessons learned from our preceding studies . despite the use of larger multiplets , these models can still be of interest ; in addition to allowing for radiative neutrino mass , the exotics with larger electric - charges in these multiplets can enhance the @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 signal from dark - matter annihilation when they appear inside loops  @xcite .",
    "this can provide a simple connection between the mechanism of neutrino mass and the astrophysical gamma - ray signal  @xcite .    before proceeding we note that the connection between radiative neutrino mass and dark matter has been explored in a number of different models , including ref .",
    "@xcite , which precedes ma s work ; for other examples see  @xcite .",
    "previous works on inert - singlet models  @xcite , inert - doublet models  @xcite , and inert - triplet models  @xcite are also well known .",
    "additional relevant works dealing with inert - multiplet dark matter and/or radiative neutrino mass are cited in the text .",
    "note also that refs .",
    "@xcite have detailed the one - loop realizations of the @xmath9 operator for neutrino mass .",
    "inert scalar dark matter can also help cure the little hierarchy problem found in low - scale seesaws  @xcite .",
    "the present work follows on from the generalized tree - level seesaws presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : rad_nu_plus_dm ]",
    "we discuss ma s model and present the generalizations that similarly achieve radiative neutrino mass and dark - matter candidates .",
    "section  [ sec : fermion_dm ] considers the case of fermionic dark - matter , while section  [ sec : scalar_dm ] discusses scalar dark - matter .",
    "one of the generalized models is presented in more detail in section  [ sec : real_and_complex_scalar ] . in section  [ sec : gauge_symmetry ] we show that some of the models allow a simple extension , such that the discrete symmetry appears as an accidental symmetry in the low - energy theory . models with exotics forming larger @xmath10 representations are discussed in section  [ sec : non - minimal_models ] ( and explicitly displayed in the appendix ) .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we are interested in the class of models that generate neutrino mass radiatively by the diagram in figure  [ fig : yukawa_loop ] . here",
    "@xmath11 is a beyond - sm fermion and @xmath12 are new scalars ( which can be identical in some cases ) .",
    "a basic feature of this diagram is that the three vertices can all involve two beyond - sm fields .",
    "consequently one can always consider a discrete @xmath4 symmetry whose action on the beyond - sm multiplets is \\ { , s_1 , s_2 } & & -  \\ { , s_1 , s_2 } , while all sm fields transform trivially .",
    "the lightest field within the multiplets @xmath11 and @xmath12 will thus be stable , and provided this field is electrically neutral and colorless , one arrives at a dark - matter candidate .",
    "these comments are generic for all models of this type ; the connection between loop masses and dark matter is simple to realize in this class of models .    figure  [ fig : yukawa_loop ] produces majorana neutrino masses , so the loop diagram must contain a source of lepton number violation . choosing the convention for lepton - number symmetry such that the new fermion @xmath11 has the same value as the sm leptons , there are two ways to explicitly break lepton - number symmetry ; it can be broken at either the mass insertion or at one of the vertices .",
    "the simplest models , in terms of the requisite number of beyond - sm multiplets , are those with a lepton number violating ( majorana ) mass insertion . in this case one",
    "has @xmath13 and minimal cases occur for @xmath14 .",
    "thus , only two beyond - sm multiplets are required . the general loop - diagram for this subset of models is given in figure  [ fig : mass_loop ] .",
    "we consider this case first .",
    "we seek models that achieve neutrino mass via figure  [ fig : mass_loop ] and give rise to dark - matter candidates .",
    "clearly the fermion must form a real representation of the sm gauge symmetry , @xmath15 , in order to allow a bare majorana mass .",
    "as we are considering dark - matter candidates we do not consider colored fields .",
    "note also that @xmath16 must be odd - valued to ensure there is no fractionally charged particles ( the lightest of which would be stable and thus cosmologically excluded ) .",
    "odd - valued @xmath16 also ensures that @xmath17 contains an electrically neutral component , so no additional constraint is imposed by this demand .    with this information",
    "one can obtain the viable combinations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 that generate figure  [ fig : mass_loop ] . the basic lagrangian terms are & & i|_r^d__r - _ r + |d^s|^2 -m_s^2 |s|^2 + |l _",
    "r+_(s^h)^2 + , [ eq : ma_lagrangian ] where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the sm lepton ( scalar ) doublet and @xmath21 denotes the charge - conjugate of @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that the possible combinations for @xmath11 and @xmath18 are not restricted by quantum numbers ; one can consider increasingly large multiplets , presumably up to some unitarity limits  @xcite , and realize a model with figure  [ fig : mass_loop ] and a dark - matter candidate .",
    "however , if we restrict our attention to models with @xmath22 , such that no new multiplet is larger than the adjoint representation , there are only two possibilities .",
    "the first case is ma s original proposal , which employs an additional ( inert ) scalar doublet @xmath23 , and a gauge - singlet fermion @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "this model is the prototype for the class we are considering .",
    "the second model also employs the scalar doublet @xmath23 , but instead utilizes the triplet fermion @xmath25  @xcite , familiar from the type - iii seesaw  @xcite .",
    "thus , both of the models are known in the literature , and there are no additional possibilities unless one considers larger multiplets .    in each of these models",
    "the dark - matter candidate can be a neutral component of @xmath18 or a majorana fermion .",
    "there is , however , an important difference between the singlet case , @xmath26 , and the other model ; the singlet does not participate in weak interactions and is therefore brought into thermal contact with the sm sector via the yukawa coupling . for fermionic dark - matter , this can produce conflict between the need to keep the yukawa coupling large to ensure thermal dark - matter , and the need to suppress the yukawa coupling to limit the size of flavor changing effects .",
    "this issue does not arise in the triplet fermion model , as the fermions can maintain equilibrium with the sm sector via weak interactions in these cases , even if the yukawa couplings are suppressed .",
    "for an analysis of ma s model , incorporating recent lhc data on the higgs , see e.g.  ref .",
    "also note that loop effects can induce observable interactions between dark matter and experimental detectors in ma s model  @xcite .",
    "having exhausted the minimal models with a lepton - number violating mass insertion , we now consider models with a dirac mass insertion ; i.e.  the beyond - sm fermion has nonzero hypercharge . in this case",
    "the general mass - diagram has the form shown in figure  [ fig : yukawa_loop ] .",
    "the fields @xmath17 and @xmath27 are no longer related by charge conjugation , so the mass insertion is of the dirac type and @xmath11 is a vector - like fermion .",
    "in addition one requires @xmath28 .",
    "we again consider a @xmath4 symmetry under which the sm fields transform trivially but the new fields are odd .",
    "the lagrangian contains the following pertinent terms : & & i|^d _  -   m _  +  _",
    "i=1,2\\{|d^s_i|^2  -  m_i^2 |s_i|^2 } + & & +  _ 1|l _ rs_1  +  _ 2 |l^c_l_2  +  _",
    "s_1_2 h^2 + , [ eq : l_ykawa_lagrange ] where , in our convention , lepton number symmetry is broken by a yukawa coupling .",
    "with the @xmath4 symmetry present , there are no terms in the scalar potential that are linear in _ just one _ of the new scalars @xmath12",
    ". therefore the beyond - sm scalars do not acquire an induced vev and parameter space exists for which @xmath29 , so the @xmath4 symmetry remains exact .",
    "in selecting viable multiplets one must ensure that no new multiplet contains a fractionally charged field , to avoid a ( cosmologically excluded ) stable charged field . to ensure that the lightest @xmath4-odd field is a neutral dark - matter candidate one must demand that the new multiplets contain at least one neutral field .",
    "note that the neutral field does not have to appear as an explicit propagating degree of freedom inside the loop diagram ; it is sufficient merely that the loop - diagram exists and that the particle content includes a neutral field that can play the role of dark matter .    with these conditions in mind we search for viable combinations of the beyond - sm multiplets that realize figure  [ fig : yukawa_loop ] .",
    "we find that the size of the beyond - sm multiplets is not restricted by our demands ; one can consider increasingly large multiplets and realize the loop diagram .",
    "however , if attention is restricted to models in which none of the beyond - sm multiplets are larger than the adjoint representation , only seven distinct models are found . these are listed in table  [ l_yukawa ] . of the seven models ,",
    "one employs the exotic lepton triplet @xmath30 , studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , three contain an exotic vector - like ( and sm - like ) lepton doublet @xmath31  @xcite , and two contain a charged lepton doublet @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "there is also a model with a sm - like charged singlet fermion , @xmath33 , which already appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "neutrino masses take a standard calculable form in these models . for example , in models @xmath34 and @xmath35 only singly - charged exotics propagate in the loop , and the sm neutrino mass matrix is given by , and should be multiplied by an extra factor of 2 for model @xmath34 . ]",
    "( _ ) _ & & + & & here @xmath36 is the mass for the charged component of the exotic fermion @xmath37 , and summation is implied for the repeated index @xmath38 ( which labels the exotic - fermion generations ) .",
    "the masses @xmath39 refer to the charged scalar mass - eigenstates , which are linear combinations of the charged scalars @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the mixing results from the @xmath42-term in eq .  , which takes the explicit form @xmath43 , for models @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "if all the exotics are at the tev scale one requires dimensionless couplings of @xmath44 to obtain @xmath45  ev .",
    "the scenario with all exotics at the tev scale is most interesting from a phenomenological perspective .",
    "however , strictly speaking one only requires the lightest exotic to have a mass of @xmath46 in order to realize a dark - matter candidate .",
    "the other exotics can be much heavier , allowing larger dimensionless couplings .    before moving on to discuss dark matter in detail",
    ", we note that , of the models in table  [ l_yukawa ] , only models @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath47 are expected to produce ( dominant ) radiative neutrino masses in the absence of the @xmath4 symmetry , as we briefly discuss in appendix  [ app : mass_no_z2 ] .",

    "<S> we present a class of models with radiative neutrino mass and stable dark - matter candidates . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino mass is generated by a one - loop diagram with the same topography as ma s 2006 proposal ( which used an inert scalar - doublet and singlet fermion ) . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize this approach and determine all variants with new fields no larger than the adjoint representation . </S>",
    "<S> when the neutrino mass diagram contains a majorana mass insertion there are two possibilities , both of which are known . </S>",
    "<S> if the mass insertion is of the dirac type there are seven additional models , two of which are excluded by direct - detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the other five models are also constrained , such that only scalar dark - matter is viable . </S>",
    "<S> there are cases with an inert singlet , an inert doublet , and an inert triplet , providing a natural setting for inert @xmath0-tuplet models of dark matter , with the additional feature of achieving radiative neutrino mass . </S>",
    "<S> we show that some of the models admit a simple explanation for the ( requisite ) discrete symmetry , and briefly discuss cases with representations larger than the adjoint , which can admit a connection to the astrophysical gamma - ray signal .    a class of inert n - tuplet models with radiative neutrino mass and dark matter +    sandy  s.  c.  law@xmath1 and kristian  l.  mcdonald@xmath2 +    * department of physics , national cheng - kung university , + tainan 701 , taiwan + @xmath3 arc centre of excellence for particle physics at the terascale , + school of physics , the university of sydney , nsw 2006 , australia + </S>"
