    "globular clusters ( gcs , hereafter ) are well - studied stellar systems containing the oldest stars in the galaxy , and much of our knowledge of stellar dynamics and stellar evolution rests on them . with an age of about 10 gyr ,",
    "low - mass ( @xmath0 1 @xmath1 ) stars are now on the agb phase in gcs . while younger , more massive",
    ", agb stars often turn into infrared stars with thick dust shells due to heavy mass loss , the low - mass stars found in gcs do not appear to evolve in this manner .",
    "although several red giants in gcs show small mid - infrared ( mir ) excesses that indicate weak mass loss ( @xcite ; ramdani , jorissen 2001 ) , they bear little resemblance to the dust - enshrouded stars found in young magellanic clusters @xcite .",
    "maser emission is another characteristic often seen in such objects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , no maser sources have ever been found in gcs ( knapp , kerr 1973 ; @xcite ; cohen , malkan 1979 ; dickey , malkan 1980 ) .",
    "a possible exception is the oh maser source v720 oph in ngc  6171 ( frail , beasley 1994 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested two possibilities for this object : to be a foreground star or to be an evolutionary product of a merged binary . whereas previous surveys searched for oh and/or h@xmath2o masers ,",
    "no sio maser detection has yet been reported ( for negative results with the vla , see the web page ) . in this paper",
    ", we report on a result of sio maser detections in agb variables , possibly associated with gcs .",
    "targets were selected from our program of near infrared ( nir ) observations of more than 140 gcs taken from the known galactic total of 150 .",
    "nir monitoring observations started in 2002 march using an array camera ( sirius ) attached to the 1.4 m irsf telescope at the south african astronomical observatory [ see @xcite and @xcite for instrumental details ] .",
    "during the course of this work , we found several new red variables with @xmath3 mag .",
    "these stars are redder than the samples with small infrared excesses , studied by @xcite or @xcite , at least in @xmath4 , so they are more promising candidates for sio maser emission .",
    "( 150mm,200mm)f1.eps    for thirty two stars , the sio maser lines ( @xmath5@xmath6 and 2 ) at 43.122 and 42.821 ghz @xcite , respectively , were searched for with the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope during 2004 march 2830 and on may 8 .",
    "the half - power beam width was about 40@xmath7 at 43 ghz .",
    "we used a cooled sis receiver ( @xmath8 180  250 k ) and acousto - optical spectrometers with high ( 40 khz ; aos - h ) and low ( 250 khz ; aos - w ) resolutions having 2048 channels each .",
    "the spectrometer arrays covered velocity ranges of @xmath9 km s@xmath10 and @xmath11 km s@xmath10 in aos - h and aos - w , respectively .",
    "the conversion factor of the antenna temperature to the flux density was @xmath12 jy k@xmath10 .",
    "we detected sio maser emissions from six red variables toward six gcs ( among 32 surveyed stars ) , mostly in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "for the previously known variable stars in ngc  6171 and pal  10 , the variable ids ( v1 and v2 , respectively ) were taken from the catalog of variable stars in gcs by @xcite .",
    "ngc  6171 v1 is v720 oph , mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the other four variables were newly found from our nir observations , and named according to clement s numbering system ( namely liller  1 v1 , pal  6 v1 , terzan  5 v5 , and terzan  12 v1 ) .",
    "lines of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 were detected , except in the case of terzan  12 v1 , for which only @xmath13 was seen .",
    "their spectra from aos - h are shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the detection criteria used by @xcite were satisfied by these lines , except for marginal detections of the @xmath14 lines in liller  1 v1 and ngc  6171 v1 .",
    "the integration time for each object was about 30 minutes , similar to those made in the past sio surveys ( @xcite ; deguchi et al .",
    "the detections were confirmed in aos - w spectra in all cases .",
    "the observational properties of the detected objects are summarized in table [ tab:1 ] , which contains the source positions , angular separations from the cluster center ( @xmath15 ) , sio transitions , radial velocities ( @xmath16 ) , peak antenna temperatures ( @xmath17 ) , integrated intensities , and rms noise levels for both transitions from the aos - h spectra .",
    "table [ tab:2 ] lists the properties of the gcs .",
    "they were mostly taken from a compilation by @xcite . in the table ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the galactic coordinates of the cluster center , @xmath20 is the cluster velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( with the escape velocity @xmath21 at half radius between parentheses),ognedin / gc/ . ]",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the half - mass radius and the tidal radius of the cluster respectively , and [ fe / h ] is the metallicity . in addition , we give dm ( the distance modulus of each clusters ) and @xmath24 ( the reddening ) used to calculate the absolute bolometric magnitudes in subsection [ sec : mbol ] , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the number of nir sio candidates within 34@xmath27 of the cluster and the contamination probability , which are discussed in subsection [ sec : bulge ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the derived @xmath28 values should be lower than those of the agb tips , which depend on the age and chemical composition .",
    "@xcite showed that the younger agb stars evolve upwards in luminosity .",
    "they consider that the tip luminosity for metal - rich gcs is about @xmath29 mag at an age of about 10 gyr .",
    "only pal  6 v1 and terzan  12 have a @xmath28 value consistent with this limit , i.e. , lower than @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , the merger of binary systems or direct collision can produce massive objects that would reach higher luminosity @xcite .",
    "this possibility is also mentioned by @xcite .",
    "this is related to a problem concerning planetary nebulae ( pne ) in gcs .",
    "so far , four pne are known to exist in gcs ( ps-1 in m  15 , @xcite ; gjjc-1 in m  22 , @xcite ; jafu-1 in pal  6 and jafu-2 in ngc  6441 , @xcite ) . while this number is less than expected based on the assumption that every dying star produces a pn , current models predict that the masses of white dwarfs in gcs are too small to produce pne ( see @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these authors suggested that only special objects , whose masses are augmented in close - binary interaction , can become pne .",
    "because the variable stars with heavy mass - loss have a lifetime roughly equal to that of planetary nebulae , it seems natural to expect the same number of them , both of which are considered to be products of merged binaries . since blue stragglers are common in gcs @xcite and also with the recent discoveries that they contain numerous low - mass x - ray binaries and millisecond pulsars @xcite , it is strongly suggested that close - binary formations and merger events occur relatively often in them @xcite . with these indications and our new detection of masers with high luminosities ( ngc  6171 v1 , pal  10 v2 , and terzan  5 v5 )",
    ", we support the idea of a merged binary by @xcite .",
    "it may be slightly premature , however , at this stage to discuss their statistics and formation rates before further complete surveys are made .",
    "among the six sio maser sources that we detected in the present survey , five , with the exception of liller  1 v1 , stand as potential candidates for gc members . among them ,",
    "the variables toward ngc 6171 and terzan 5 are highly likely gc members , though those toward pal 6 , pal 10 , and terzan 12 , are somewhat debatable .",
    "the membership must be approved ( or disproved ) much more firmly in future observations , because some uncertainty remains as to the coincidence of the maser velocities with those of the clusters due to a lack of precision in the optical velocity measurements of gcs .",
    "these maser sources are dust - enshrouded agb stars that were not expected in gcs in the past .",
    "some of them have luminosities that are too high to fit the standard evolutionary tracks of low - mass stars , and may have evolved from binary mergers . on the other hand , sio sources toward pal  6 and terzan  12 have luminosities that are consistent with the normal stellar evolution of old stars , though they might also be special objects at a certain stage of close - binary interaction .",
    "the authors are grateful to the staff members of nobeyama radio observatory for supporting the 45-m telescope operations .",
    "they also thank dr .",
    "i.  s. glass for his thorough reading of the manuscript , dr . m.  w. feast for useful comments , and the irsf / sirius team for near - infrared observations .",
