    "massive stars are sources of copious stellar winds of variable mass - loss rate and velocity , which create circumstellar and interstellar shells of a wide range of morphologies ( johnson & hogg 1965 ; chu 1981 ; lozinskaya & lomovskij 1982 ; heckathorn , bruhweiler & gull 1982 ; chu , treffers & kwitter 1983 ; dopita et al .",

    "the high angular resolution of _ spitzer _ images ( @xmath06 arcsec at @xmath3 m ) even allowed us to discover parsec - scale circumstellar nebulae around several already known evolved massive stars in the magellanic clouds ( gvaramadze , kroupa & pflamm - altenburg 2010d ; gvaramadze , pflamm - altenburg & kroupa 2011a ) .",
    "the vast majority of nebulae associated with massive stars were detected far from ( known ) star clusters where the massive stars are believed to form ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "this suggests that central stars of these nebulae are runaways .",
    "indeed , studies of massive stars in the field showed that most of them can be traced back to their parent clusters ( e.g. schilbach & rser 2008 ) or are spatially located not far from known star clusters and therefore could escape from them ( de wit et al .",

    "2010 ) . in the latter case",
    ", the well - defined circular shape of nebulae around wr120bb and wr120bc implies that these two wr stars are located outside the cluster , so that their nebulae are not affected by stellar winds of other massive members of the cluster .    in this paper , we report the discovery of a new circular shell in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) with _ spitzer _ and the results of follow - up spectroscopic observations of its central star with gemini - south .",

    ", we adopt a colour excess of @xmath22=0.03 mag . to model the lmc interstellar reddening , we assume the reddening law suggested by howarth ( 1983 ) with @xmath25=3.1 .",
    "the best fit to the whole sed was achieved with @xmath22=0.18 mag , which is comparable to that of 0.22 mag derived for star2 in section[sec : b ] . on the other hand , a similar fit to the sed",
    "could also be obtained with a colour excess of 0.12 mag if the luminosities of the two companions are both reduced by 0.1dex .",
    "this @xmath22 is closer to the one obtained from the analysis of the circular shell ( see section[sec : neb ] ) .",
    "future uv observations should enable a much more precise determination of the luminosities and redenning .",
    "a comparison of the stellar parameters of the wr component with the almost complete sample of the wr stars in the lmc ( hainich et al . 2014 ) reveals that the analyzed wr star is one of the hottest wr stars in the lmc . while @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the wr component are comparable to those of its o companion , the number of heii ionizing photons is four orders of magnitude larger , placing bat993a among the strongest heii ionizing sources in the lmc .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the unique signature of heii emission observed in the circular shell , as discussed in section[sec : neb ] .",
    "johnson & hogg ( 1965 ) were the first who noted association of wr stars with filamentary shells and suggested that they are the result of interaction between the material ejected from the stars and the interstellar matter ( cf .",
    "avedisova 1972 ) . this suggestion was further elaborated to take into account the interaction of the wr wind with the circumstellar material shed during the preceding red supergiant or lbv stages ( e.g. dercole 1992 ; garca - segura , langer & mac low 1996a , b ; brighenti & dercole 1997 ) .",
    "circumstellar _ shells produced in this process show signatures of cno - processing ( e.g. esteban et al . 1992 ; stock , barlow & wesson 2011 ) and are associated exclusively with wnl stars ( e.g. lozinskaya & tutukov 1981 ; chu 1981 ; gruendl et al .",
    "2000 ; gvaramadze et al .",

    "2009 ; burgemeister et al .",
    "the size and crossing time of this region determine the characteristic size and lifetime of the circumstellar shells , which are typically several pc and several tens of thousands of years , respectively .",
    "the winds of more evolved ( wne ) wr stars interact directly with the local interstellar medium and create new , generally more extended shells .",
    "correspondingly , the chemical composition of these _ interstellar _ shells is similar to that of ordinary hii regions ( e.g. esteban et al .",
    "1992 ; stock et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "since the wr component of bat993a is of wne type , it is natural to expect that its associated shell should consist mostly of interstellar matter . in section[sec : neb - spec ] , we support this expectation by an analysis of the long - slit spectra of the shell obtained with the gemini and du pont telescopes and the salt .",

    "there is no distinct limb - brightened emission in the southwest direction , but the shell can still be discerned because of a diffuse emission filling its interior . bat993a and star2",
    "are clearly resolved in the image .",
    "the lopsided appearance of the shell and the off - centred position of the stars suggest that the ambient medium is denser in the eastern direction , which is consistent with the presence of a prominent hii region in this direction ( cf .",
    "section[sec : nebula ] and see also the next section ) .      all long - slit spectra obtained with the gemini and du pont telescopes and the salt",
    "show numerous emission lines along the whole slit .",

    "below we analyse the obtained spectra to understand the origin of the shell .      for the analysis of physical conditions and elemental abundances in the shell",

    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra of the shell were extracted from the area of radius of 15 arcsec centred on bat993a with the central @xmath293 arcsec excluded to avoid the effect of bat993a and star2 .",

    "since the spectra of the shell do not show any significant continuum ( see fig.[fig : neb_1d_spec ] ) , we assumed in our calculations that ew of underlying absorption in balmer hydrogen lines is = 0  ( cf .",

    "the detection of a strong nebular heii @xmath304686 emission implies the presence of a non - negligible amount of o@xmath49 , whose abundance can be derived in the way described in izotov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the helium abundance was derived in the manner described in detail in izotov & thuan ( 1994 ) , izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1994 ) and izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1997 ) .",
    "the new fits from benjamin , skillman & smith ( 2002 ) were used to convert hei emission line strengths to singly ionized helium abundances .",
    "one can see that the shell abundances derived from both data sets are consistent with each other and the lmc ones within the error margins , which implies the absence of n and he enrichment of the shell and suggests that it is mainly composed of material swept - up from the local interstellar medium .",
    "+     +     +     +    to study the gas kinematics around bat993a and star2 , we calculated the distribution of the heliocentric radial velocity , @xmath50 , along the slit using both gemini spectra and the method and programs described in zasov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . to exclude possible systematic shifts ,",
    "the closest bright night sky line [ oi ] @xmath306363  was used . to match the scale along the slit with the seeing during the observations , the spectra were rebinned from 0.073 to 0.4 arcsec pixel@xmath51 .",
    "finally , only those velocity measurements were used which satisfy the criteria s / n@xmath423 and @xmath52 .",
    "the upper panels in fig.[fig : pv ] plot the h@xmath28 intensity and @xmath50 distributions along the slit for both gemini spectra , obtained for pa=125@xmath53 ( left - hand panel ) and pa=22@xmath53 . in both cases , the h@xmath28 emission appears everywhere along the slit , but its intensity shows clear correlation with the shell ( see the bottom right - hand panel for the mcels2 h@xmath28 image of the shell with the slit positions for the gemini observations shown by dashed lines ) .",
    "particularly , it has two peaks in the southeast direction ( at @xmath08 and 13 arcsec from bat993a ) , which correspond to the two arcs on the eastern side of the shell . in the northwest direction , the h@xmath28 emission peaks at @xmath018 arcsec , which is consistent with the greater extent of the shell in this direction .",
    "one can also see that @xmath50 is quite uniform within the shell and in the southeast and southwest directions , and does not show a distinct correlation with the h@xmath28 intensity peaks . on the other hand , there is a noticeable increase of @xmath50 in the northwest direction , and to a lesser extent in the northeast one , suggesting that the shell might have a blister - like structure .",
    "the bottom left - hand panel in fig.[fig : pv ] plots intensity of the heii @xmath304686 line along the slit ( indicated in the bottom right - hand panel by a solid line with pa=90@xmath53 ) for the du pont spectrum taken on 2012 december 13 .",
    "one can see that the heii emission shows a good correlation with the shell . like the h@xmath28 emission , it is the brightest on the eastern edge of the shell and extends to a larger angular distance in the western direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the heii emission is concentrated only in the shell , which implies that the heiii region is trapped by the shell .",
    "it is instructive , therefore , to derive the effective temperature of the wr star by applying the zanstra method ( zanstra 1927 ) . with @xmath54(heii @xmath304686)/@xmath54(h@xmath34)@xmath00.07 ( see table[tab : int3 ] ) and using equation(1 ) in kaler & jacoby ( 1989 ) , one finds @xmath55@xmath095 kk , which agrees fairly well with the temperature derived in section[sec : mod ] ( see table[tab : model ] ) .      in section[sec :",
    "phys ] , we found that the chemical composition and electron number density of the shell are similar to those measured for hii regions and interstellar shells around wr stars , which implies that the shell originated because of interaction between the wr wind and the local interstellar medium .",
    "this implication can be further supported by using diagnostic diagrams , which allow to classify emission - line nebulae on the basis of line ratios ( see e.g. kniazev , pustilnik & zucker 2008a ; frew & parker 2010 , and references therein ) . with ratios @xmath56(@xmath54(h@xmath28)/@xmath54([nii ] @xmath316548,6584))=1.21 , @xmath57(h@xmath28)/@xmath54([sii ] @xmath316717,6731))=0.84 , and @xmath57([oiii ] @xmath305007)/@xmath54(h@xmath34))=0.86 , the shell is located in the region occupied by hii regions and interstellar shells around magellanic cloud wr stars ( see fig . 4 in frew & parker 2010 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the circular shell is a wind - blown structure photoionized by its central stars .",
    "we speculate that the two - arc morphology of the shell could be caused by a sharp density gradient along the line - of - sight , resulting in blow - up of the shell in the transverse direction as it entered in the region of lower density .",
    "this , along with the brightness asymmetry of the shell and the displacement of its central stars , provides support to the possibility that the shell is associated with a blister - like , wind - driven bubble .",
    "there is mounting evidence that massive stars form in a clustered way ( gvaramadze et al .",
    "2012b and references therein ) .",
    "subsequently , some of them found themselves in the field because of dynamical few - body encounters ( poveda et al .",
    "1967 ; gies & bolton 1986 ) , binary - supernova explosions ( blaauw 1961 ; stone 1991 ) and cluster dissolution caused by gas expulsion ( tutukov 1978 ; kroupa , aarseth & hurley 2001 ) .",
    "the discovery of two massive and therefore rare stars , one of which in its turn is a massive binary system , at @xmath00.5 pc in projection from each other , gives rise to the question of their physical relationship .",
    "a chance projection along the same line - of - sight of physically unrelated massive field stars can be rejected to a considerable degree of reliability .",
    "although such projections might be common in the vicinity of massive star clusters , they are highly improbable in the field ( cf .",
    "gvaramadze & menten 2012 ) .",
    "one can envisage two possible explanations of the close proximity of bat993a and star2 .",
    "firstly , these two stars might be members ( at least in the recent past ) of a _ runaway _ triple ( or higher multiplicity ) hierarchical system , which became unstable and dissolved into a binary system ( now bat993a ) and a single unbound star ( star2 ) in the course of evolution of its most massive component(s ) ( e.g. gvaramadze & menten 2012 ) .",
    "if this is the case , then the brightness asymmetry of the shell and the offset of the stars towards its brightest portion could be because of the eastward motion of the system . for a typical space velocity of runaway stars of several tens of @xmath58 and assuming that the system was ejected @xmath596 myr ago ( i.e. soon after its formation in the parent cluster )",
    ", one finds that the cluster should be at @xmath59100@xmath41200 pc away . proceeding from this , we searched for known star clusters to the west of the shell and found two open clusters , [ hs66]49 and ic2111 , at @xmath0 41 and 92 pc in projection , respectively ( cf . gvaramadze et al .",
    "the age of the former cluster is unknown , while that of the latter one is 6@xmath291 myr ( wolf et al .",
    "2007 ) , i.e. consistent with the age of the wn3 star of @xmath06 myr ( see section[sec : mod ] ) .",
    "the runaway scenario , however , implies that the circular shell should be of circumstellar origin ( cf .",
    "lozinskaya 1992 ; danforth & chu 2001 ; gvaramadze et al .",
    "2009 ) , which is inconsistent with the normal chemical composition of the shell .",
    "it is likely therefore that the lopsided appearance of the shell and the displacement of its central stars are simply because of the eastward density gradient of the ambient medium ( cf .",
    "sections[sec : nebula ] and [ sec : neb ] ) .",
    "secondly , bat993a and star2 could be members of a yet unrecognized star cluster .",
    "observational and theoretical arguments suggest that star clusters are formed in compact configurations with the characteristic radius of @xmath601 pc , which is independent of cluster mass ( kroupa & boily 2002 ) .",
    "this makes them hardly resolved in the magellanic clouds , where 1 pc corresponds to @xmath03@xmath414 arcsec .",
    "indeed , some of the brightest stars in these galaxies are today known to be star clusters ( e.g. weigelt & baier 1985 ; walborn et al . 1995 , 1999 ; heydari - malayeri et al .",
    "moreover , the detection of young star clusters could additionally be hampered because of heavy obscuration by dust in their parent molecular clouds .",
    "some members of these embedded clusters , however , could be visible in optical wavelengths if they were dynamically ejected out of the obscuring material ( gvaramadze et al .",
    "2010b , 2012b ) and/or if they are located in a favourably oriented blister - like hii region on the near side of the natal cloud ( cf .",
    "gvaramadze et al .",
    "it is possible that just this situation takes place in the case of bat993a and star2 ( cf .",
    "section[sec : mod ] ) , and that their cousins in the parent cluster are hidden by obscuring material along our line - of - sight .",
    "we found some support to this possibility in the @xmath15 survey of the magellanic clouds by kato et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . as we already noted in section[sec : nebula ] , this survey resolved bat993a into two stars separated by 1 arcsec from each other ( see fig.[fig : acq ] and table[tab : phot ] ) . assuming that star3 is a massive member of the same cluster as bat993a and star2 , one can derive the @xmath61-band extinction towards it using the @xmath10 and @xmath21 magnitudes from table[tab : phot ] and the relationship : @xmath62 \\ , , \\label{eqn : ak}\\ ] ] where @xmath61=@xmath21+@xmath63 mag ( carpenter 2001 ) .",
    "for the intrinsic @xmath64 colour of @xmath410.21 mag ( typical of o stars ; martins & plez 2006 ) , we found @xmath65=0.61 mag and the absolute @xmath61-band magnitude @xmath66 mag , which corresponds to an o8.5v star ( martins & plez 2006 ) .",
    "then using @xmath67=@xmath414.25 mag ( martins & plez 2006 ) and @xmath68 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) , we found @xmath69=5.42 mag and the visual magnitude of star3 of @xmath70@xmath019.7 mag .",
    "the latter two estimates imply that the extinction towards the putative cluster is variable , which is often the case in young star clusters ( e.g. sagar , munari & de boer 2001 ; espinoza , selman & melnick 2009 ) , and that the contribution of star3 to the ( optical ) spectrum of bat993a is negligible ( cf .",
    "section[sec : mod ] ) .",
    "to conclude , follow - up ir spectroscopy of star3 is highly desirable to confirm its status as an o star and to prove the existence of a star cluster possibly associated with bat993a and star2 .",
    "the latter in its turn would provide one more piece of evidence that massive stars form in a clustered mode .",

    "<S> we report the first - ever discovery of a wolf  rayet ( wr ) star in the large magellanic cloud via detection of a circular shell with the _ spitzer space telescope_. follow - up observations with gemini - south resolved the central star of the shell into two components separated from each other by @xmath02 arcsec ( or @xmath00.5 pc in projection ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of these components turns out to be a wn3 star with h and he lines both in emission and absorption ( we named it bat993a using the numbering system based on extending the breysacher et al . </S>",
    "<S> catalogue ) . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy of the second component showed that it is a b0v star . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent spectroscopic observations of bat993a with the du pont 2.5-m telescope and the southern african large telescope revealed that it is a close , eccentric binary system , and that the absorption lines are associated with an o companion star . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the spectrum of the binary system using the non - lte potsdam wolf  rayet ( powr ) code , confirming that the wr component is a very hot ( @xmath090 kk ) wn star . </S>",
    "<S> for this star , we derived a luminosity of @xmath1 and a mass - loss rate of @xmath2 , and found that the stellar wind composition is dominated by helium with 20 per cent of hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy of the shell revealed an heiii region centred on bat993a and having the same angular radius ( @xmath015 arcsec ) as the shell . we thereby add a new example to a rare class of high - excitation nebulae photoionized by wr stars . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the nebular spectrum showed that the shell is composed of unprocessed material , implying that the shell was swept - up from the local interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the physical relationship between the newly identified massive stars and their possible membership of a previously unrecognized star cluster .    </S>",
