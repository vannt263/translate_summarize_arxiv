    "the discovery of disks around main - sequence stars has opened possibilities for studying nascent planetary systems .",

    "hd 141569 (= iras 15473 - 0346 = sao 140789 ) , classified as b9.5ve by jaschek & jaschek ( 1992 ) , is a herbig ae / be star with double peaked h@xmath4 emission .",
    "jaschek , jaschek , & egret ( 1986 ) first identified it as a main sequence star with infrared excess and an sed peaking at @xmath060 .",
    "the disk has an optical depth @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , which is a few times larger than the two well - known infrared excess stars , @xmath3  pic and hr 4796a . with an hipparcos measured distance of 99 @xmath6 pc",

    "such a low luminosity for its spectral type is consistent with that of other young main sequence a stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the age of hd 141569 is not well determined .",
    "it is located approximately on the zero age main sequence , has an infrared optical depth similar to that of other young a stars , has strong co emission ( @xcite ) , and has two t - tauri like companion stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "together , these constrain its age to 10@xmath1010@xmath11 yr .",
    "the 1.1  results reported here are part of our guaranteed time project to study the environments of nearby stars with the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer ( nicmos ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "hd 141569 was included because of its large far - infrared optical depth , co emission , and extended elliptical disk in mid - infrared images by silverstone et al .",
    "the scattered light disk around hd 141569 has also been observed with nicmos at 1.6  by augereau et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "coronagraphic observations of hd 141569 were made on 27 september 1998 with nicmos camera 2 .",
    "the f110w filter ( @xmath12=1.10 , fwhm=0.59 ) was used to maximize the angular resolution while minimizing scattered light . with the target positioned in the 0.@xmath13 radius coronagraph ,",
    "three multiaccum sequences were obtained , for a total integration time of 607.9 sec at each of two spacecraft orientations , rolled 8  about the target axis with respect to each other . to minimize time - dependent point spread function ( psf ) variations , the two image sets were obtained within 40 minutes .    prior to each set of coronagraphic observations , 0.36  s target acquisition frames were obtained with the f171 m ( @xmath12=1.72 , fwhm=0.07 ) filter .",
    "contemporaneous lamp flats and backgrounds were obtained at f160w for the purpose of locating the coronagraphic hole and enabling good flat - fielding near the hole .",
    "the multiaccum data sets were processed with the nicreduce software ( @xcite ) .",
    "dark frames taken on 20 september 1998 were used to subtract the dark current and correct the detector shading .",
    "a special coronagraphic flat field was created by modifying a standard high s / n on - orbit f110w reference flat field . within a radius of 12 pixels ( 0.@xmath191 ) of the hole",
    ", the pixel sensitivities were measured in the f160w hole - finding image , scaled to f110w , and replaced in the reference flat .",
    "after bias subtraction , linearization and flat fielding , known bad pixels were corrected with a distance weighted average within a radius of eight pixels , and the three multiaccum images from each spacecraft orientation were medianed .",
    "the best available photometric calibration was applied to the final f110w images in which 1 adu s@xmath13 = 2.031@xmath1410@xmath15 jy and 0  mag = 1775 jy ( @xcite ) .    in the reduced and calibrated nicmos images ,",
    "scattered light from the star still dominates the flux levels at radii of 15@xmath1 , so in order to see the disk , a psf star must be subtracted . the same observing strategy and the f110w filter were used for 14 other stars in this gto program , and targets which do not show extended disk emission form a library of possible psf stars .",
    "the detailed character of the nicmos psf changes with time primarily due to thermal variations in the hst optical assembly ( @xcite ) ; hence some psf star subtractions produce much lower residuals than others .",
    "each psf image was registered using cubic convolution interpolation to both orientations of hd 141569 . only stars brighter than hd 141569 were considered , and the psf subtraction residuals are dominated by systematic uncertainties .    scattered light from two nearby stars outside the field of view , see  [ diskmorph ] , pollutes the northwest corner of the image . for both roll angles , we used synthetic psfs generated with tiny tim ( @xcite ) and positioned them at the locations of the two stars to subtract this excess scatter . a small amount of residual flux , however , can still be seen in figure [ figimg ] .",
    "figure [ fig_radialavg ] compares the azimuthally averaged disk flux observed after subtraction of each of the three best matched psf stars .",
    "two of these psf stars , @xmath16 eri and 49 cet , were disk candidates in which no disk was detected , and the third , hr 4748 , was observed specifically as a psf star . at radii greater than 1.@xmath16 ( 160 au ) , the morphology of the disk is consistent in all three subtractions .",
    "subtraction of 49 cet yielded the smallest amplitude residuals , and all further analysis was carried out on images using it as the psf .",
    "the psf - subtracted images from each telescope roll were rotated to a common orientation and averaged .",
    "regions of the image obscured by the diffraction spikes in one roll were replaced where possible by uncorrupted regions in the other roll .",
    "the psf subtracted , roll - combined coronagraphic image of hd 141569 is shown in figure [ figimg]a .",
    "an elongated disk is clearly evident at radii from @xmath01.6 to 4@xmath1 ( 160 to 400 au ) from the star .",
    "elliptical isophotes were fit to the disk image yielding a position angle of 356 @xmath2 5  and ratio of the minor to major axes of 0.63 @xmath2 0.04 .",
    "if , as is likely for dust orbiting a star , the disk is intrinsically circular , the axial ratio implies an inclination of 51@xmath23  from face - on .",
    "this geometry was used to `` deproject '' the disk to a face - on view ( see figure [ figimg]b ) .",
    "the azimuthally averaged disk surface brightness , shown in figure [ fig_radialavg ] as computed from the deprojected image , peaks at 0.3 mjy arcsec@xmath17 at a radius of 185 au and falls off to larger and smaller radii . fitting the slope of the surface brightness with a power law gives r@xmath18 for 190 @xmath19 r @xmath19 250 au . at 250",
    "au an annulus of lower surface brightness , or a `` gap '' in the disk , can be seen , which is apparent in figure [ fig_tauomega ] where the surface brightness has been multiplied by 4@xmath20r@xmath21 to determine the surface density of scatterers ( see  [ grains ] ) . on either side of this gap ,",
    "the surface density of scatterers does not vary appreciably . at r@xmath22340 au",
    ", the surface brightness of the disk falls off more steeply , as r@xmath23 .    the disk flux density , in a rectangle of area 63 sq .",
    "arcsec outside of 0.@xmath16 from the star and extending to 5.@xmath13 from the star along the major axis of the disk , is 7.2@xmath21.8  mjy .",
    "this integration excluded pixels in the diffraction spikes ; we make a purely geometric correction by finding the average flux density at every radius and multiplying it by the number of excluded pixels .",
    "the corrected total flux density is 8 @xmath2 2 mjy .",
    "the f110w magnitudes of 49 cet and hd 141569 were extrapolated from their h - band magnitudes , and the uncertainty in their flux ratio completely dominates the uncertainty in the photometry of the disk .",
    "a change of @xmath02% in the subtracted psf flux , makes a @xmath020% difference in the integrated disk flux density .",
    "the eastern side of the disk is 1.5@xmath20.2 times brighter than the western side .",
    "this difference is not an artifact of the psf subtraction and can be explained by dust particles which preferentially scatter in the forward direction .",
    "such phase functions apply even when the particles are a few times larger than the wavelength of the scattered light ( @xcite ) and are produced in recent models of fluffy grains ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "small particles probably do exist in the hd 141569 disk ( see  [ grains ] ) . the brighter side , therefore , is inclined toward us , and the ratio of forward to backward scattering implies an asymmetry parameter , @xmath24 , of 0.11 in the analytic phase function of henyey & greenstein ( 1941 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of augereau et al .",
    "( 1999b ) on hr 4796a in which the upper limit for @xmath24 was 0.15 .",
    "[ gapsection ]    the surface brightness of the disk has a complicated radial morphology which can not be represented by a single power - law .",
    "the density of scatterers , assuming the disk is everywhere optically thin , is as high at radii up to about 360 au from the star as it is in the region 200 au from the star .    dynamical processes could play a large part in shaping the disk .",
    "hd 141569 may be the brightest member of a multiple star system , since two bright stars ( henceforth `` b '' and `` c '' ) with h = 8.6 and 9.4 mag lie 7.@xmath157 ( @xmath22750 au ) and 8.@xmath193 ( @xmath22900 au ) away at respective position angles of 311.5  and 310.0 . the high probability that these stars are physical companions and assessments of their ages",
    "are discussed in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the three stars are physically associated , the two companions would likely have a significant dynamical effect on the disk .",
    "if the companion stars are in the plane of the disk , the physical separation of `` a''``b '' is 990 au and that of `` b''``c '' is 190 au .",
    "then , the ratio of the semi - major axes of the wider to the closer pair would be only @xmath05.2 .",
    "this is not expected to be a stable triple system ( @xcite ) , although such young stars may not yet have had time to become unbound .",
    "if the companions are out of the disk plane , they could be much further from the primary , and their dynamical effect could be to excite significant velocities in the disk dust perpendicular to the plane .",
    "this would puff up the disk and possibly flare it . increased collision velocities",
    "could promote the breakup of larger particles into smaller and could help account for the large number of scatterers far out in the disk .",
    "the dip in surface brightness at r@xmath25250 au which is most easily seen along the major axis ( figure [ figimg ] ) , is a striking feature of the disk .",
    "the full width at half minimum of this gap is 60 au , to which the intrinsic size of the nicmos psf contributes @xmath05% .",
    "the depth of this dip in terms of the density of scatterers ( @xmath26 ; figure [ fig_tauomega ] ) is @xmath014% of the average value between 185 and 340 au .",
    "no point source is seen within the disk , and to constrain the luminosities of possible companion bodies , we planted psf `` stars , '' generated with tiny tim ( @xcite ) , at random locations in the image at one telescope roll angle subtracted from the image at the other roll .",
    "the limiting magnitude ( 3@xmath27 ) of an object which could be detected at each radius is plotted in figure [ fig_srclimit ] .",
    "this limit does not apply to the region obscured by the diffraction spikes which , at the radius of the gap , hide @xmath017% of the disk .    at the radius of the gap , the limiting magnitude of 20.3 and an assumed age @xmath2810 myr correspond to a planet with mass @xmath280.003 m@xmath29 ( 3 m@xmath30 ) according to cooling curves by burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . at this age",
    ", the brown dwarf - planet transition occurs at log(l / l@xmath29)@xmath313 which corresponds to an f110w magnitude of @xmath016 .",
    "figure [ fig_srclimit ] shows that either a star or brown dwarf would be clearly detectable in our image at any radii greater than @xmath080 au .",
    "if the gap is cleared only by the gravity of a co - orbital planet , the planet mass is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the width and radius of the gap , respectively , and the constant @xmath35 0.1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to a planetary mass of @xmath01.3 jupiters , which given the detection limits discussed in  [ gapsection ] , could not have been detected . the orbital period for material 250 au from the 2.3",
    "m@xmath29 star is 2600 yr .",
    "if we assume that it takes @xmath22300 orbital periods to clear material in a gap , based on models of disks by bryden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , then a gap can be opened in @xmath228@xmath1410@xmath36  yr .",
    "that the gap is not completely clear may mean that processes are moving particles through the disk .",
    "the poynting - robertson timescale for particles @xmath221  is @xmath04@xmath1410@xmath37  yr , similar to the age of the star .",
    "radiation pressure will preferentially clear small grains on a timescale of @xmath010@xmath38  yr and could fill in a gap if such grains are present , or being created , in the disk .",
    "we can combine the information we infer from the nicmos images with what is known about the disk from mid to far - infrared measurements . for reflection from optically thin dust , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the angular distance of the scatterers from the illuminating star , @xmath41 is surface brightness",
    ", @xmath42 is the received flux from the star , @xmath43 is the optical depth of scatterers , and @xmath44 is the albedo ( figure [ fig_tauomega ] ) . at the peak surface brightness , @xmath40=1.@xmath19 , @xmath41=0.3 mjy arcsec@xmath17 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the optical depth to visual absorption implied by the far infrared excess is @xmath46 ; if this is also the absorption optical depth at 1.1 , then the albedo of the scatterers is @xmath00.3 .",
    "however , about  of the luminosity emitted from 3.5  25  arises from a region within 150 au of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , the total infrared @xmath43 overestimates the optical depth in the exterior part of the disk seen in reflected light and results in an underestimate of the albedo . in the region at @xmath01.@xmath19 ( 190 au ) , therefore , the albedo is greater than 0.3 and probably more like 0.4 .",
    "this is a substantially higher albedo than the zodiacal dust in our own solar system , 0.1 ( @xcite ) , but is similar to the albedos of mineral mixtures and ices found in iso spectra of herbig ae / be disks ( @xcite ) .    at",
    "r@xmath19150 au , the dust temperature is @xmath0150 k as estimated from mid - infrared colors and luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the grains are icy , the decline in 1.1  surface brightness inside 185 au may be due to the sublimation of the ice at temperatures @xmath0100 k. in this case , the grains emitting in the mid to far - infrared are the iceless counterparts of the grains at higher radius .",

    "the gas , therefore , is well inside the brightest part of the reflected light disk and the gap . in the spectrum of sylvester et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , a large rise in the continuum shortward of 8  and a possible peak at 11.3  both indicate emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .",
