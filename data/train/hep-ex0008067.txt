    "while the cumulative evidence for neutrino oscillations is very striking , the final proof that the observed anomalies are actually due to neutrino oscillations is still outstanding . in particular ,",
    "the current observations of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite are all consistent with the hypothesis of maximal @xmath2 oscillations , but do not yet exclude some alternative unconventional explanations @xcite .",
    "the main physics goal of the monolith experiment @xcite is to establish the occurrence of neutrino oscillations in atmospheric neutrinos through the explicit observation of the full first oscillation swing in @xmath2 disappearance @xcite , and to investigate and presumably exclude alternative explanations .",
    "this also yields a significantly improved measurement of the oscillation parameters with respect to previous measurements .",
    "the monolith detector will be located at the gran sasso laboratory in italy , and the measurement of the oscillation pattern can be supplemented by measurements in the cern to gran sasso neutrino beam .",
    "a proposal is currently in preparation @xcite .",
    "if approved promptly , a first part of the detector could be operational towards the end of 2004 .",
    "the physics results described in the following sections correspond to an exposure of 4 years with the full detector .",
    "the goals quoted above can be achieved with a high - mass tracking calorimeter with a coarse structure and magnetic field .",
    "a large modular structure has been chosen for the detector ( figure [ fig : module ] ) .",
    "one module consists in a stack of 120 horizontal 8 cm thick iron planes with a surface area of @xmath3 , interleaved with 2 cm planes of sensitive elements .",
    "the height of the detector is thus 12 meters .",
    "thinner plates , 2 and 4 cm thick , were also considered in the past , however the 8 cm plate thickness resulted to be best compromise between physics result and detector costs .",
    "the magnetic field configuration is also shown in figure [ fig : module ] ; iron plates are magnetized at a magnetic induction of @xmath4 t. the detector consists of two modules .",
    "optionally , the downstream module could be complemented by an end cap of vertical planes to improve the performance for non - contained muons from the cngs beam .",
    "the total mass of the detector exceeds 34 kt .",
    "glass spark counters ( resistive plate chambers with glass electrodes ) have been chosen as active detector elements .",
    "they provide two coordinates with a pitch of 3 cm , and a time resolution of 2 ns .",
    "finally , an external veto made of scintillation counters reduces the background from cosmic ray muons .",
    "in the two flavour approximation , the survival probability for neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be expressed by the well known formula @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance travelled in km , @xmath7 is the neutrino energy in gev , @xmath8 is the neutrino mixing angle , and @xmath0 is the difference of the mass square eigenvalues expressed in ev@xmath9 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "provided that the neutrino oscillation hypothesis is confirmed , another goal of the experiment is to further investigate the nature of these oscillations . depending on the oscillation parameters , oscillations into active ( @xmath10 ) or sterile ( @xmath11 ) neutrinos can be distinguished through their different effects on the up / down ratio of neutral current ( nc)-like events , and/or through the presence or absence of matter effects yielding a distortion of the observed oscillation pattern as a function of energy and/or muon charge .    even in the absence of sterile neutrinos ,",
    "matter effects are present in the case of a small contribution from @xmath12 oscillations at the `` atmospheric '' @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding msw resonance might be observable @xcite as a localized @xmath2 rate suppression either in @xmath2 or in @xmath13 .",
    "due to its ability of in situ measurement of the energy of every muon in the multi - tev range , monolith will also be a unique facility for pioneer investigations of cosmic ray muons in the unexplored 100 tev energy region .",
    "the results of these studies will give information which is relevant for the solution of the problem of the knee in the cosmic ray energy spectrum .",
    "other potential physics topics include studies of the primary atmospheric neutrino flux , the search for astrophysical point sources , and a search for a neutrino `` line '' from wimp annihilation in the center of the earth .",
    "neutrino beams from future muon storage rings @xcite ( neutrino factories ) will be essentially pure beams of either @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the occurence of @xmath16 or @xmath17 oscillations would therefore manifest itself via the appearance of wrong sign muons .",
    "a massive magnetized iron detector like monolith , with good muon charge separation and momentum measurement , could therefore be well suited @xcite for the observation of such oscillations .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite this kind of beam will in particular offer the possibility to measure the @xmath18 mixing angle , currently only constrained by the super - kamiokande and chooz results , and the sign of @xmath0 through matter effects . depending on which of the solar neutrino solutions is correct it might also open the way for the study of cp violation in the neutrino system .",
    "interestingly , the optimization of detectors for the neutrino factory , focusing on wrong sign muon appearance measurements , has yielded a detector @xcite whose basic parameters are very similar to those of monolith .",
    "this is true in particular when the source is far enough away to impinge at a sizeable angle from below ( horizontal geometry of monolith ) .",
    "for instance , a beam from fermilab ( l=7300 km ) would impinge at an angle of 35@xmath19 , and be almost aligned with the gran sasso hall axis , and therefore perpendicular to the magnetic field axis .",
    "the results obtained in the physics studies of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the measurements of @xmath20 , sign of @xmath0 , and cp violation therefore qualitatively apply to monolith used as a neutrino factory detector .",
    "of course the potential timescale of a neutrino factory is quite different from the one of the current atmospheric neutrino program .",
    "nevertheless , it might be interesting to consider that such a facility might become reality within the lifetime of the monolith project , and that its useful life might be extended accordingly .",
    "monolith is a 34 kt magnetized iron tracking calorimeter proposed for atmospheric neutrino measurements at the gran sasso laboratory in italy .",
    "its main goal is the proof of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis through the explicit observation of a sinusoidal oscillation pattern ( @xmath2 reappearance ) .",
    "other goals include auxiliary measurements in the cern to gran sasso beam , and the investigation of potential @xmath12 and @xmath21 contributions . in the long term",
    ", the detector could also be used in a potential neutrino factory beam .",
