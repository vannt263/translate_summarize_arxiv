    "recent development of gravitational wave ( gw ) interferometers such as advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( aligo ) @xcite , advanced virgo gravitational wave detector ( adv ) @xcite , and kagra [ formerly called large - scale cryogenic gravitational wave telescope ( lcgt ) ] @xcite , has raised expectations for detecting gws from violent astrophysical events .",
    "the detection of gws enables us to test general relativity and to open a new window to the universe .",
    "the merger of compact binaries , including neutron stars ( nss ) and/or black holes ( bhs ) , is a primary source candidate of gws .",
    "the detection rates of gws from these binary mergers have been studied ( e.g. , ) .",
    "recent estimations suggest that the next - generation gw interferometers would detect @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 events per year for ns - ns , bh - ns , and bh - bh binaries , respectively ( @xcite and references therein ; see also @xcite about expectations for aligo and adv in the forthcoming years ) .",
    "a more recent estimation suggests the detection rate of bh - bh binary mergers more than one order of magnitude higher @xcite .",
    "the ongoing ligo has already constrained the merger rates of these compact binaries .",
    "the upper limits on ns - ns , bh - ns , and bh - bh binary merger rates are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 yr@xmath8 at 90% confidence level , respectively @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath9 and @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 is the solar luminosity in the b band @xcite .",
    "recent simulations have revealed that the merger of neutron star binaries ( nsbs ) , i.e. , ns - ns and bh - ns binaries , leads to dynamical mass ejection .",
    "newtonian and fully general relativistic simulations of ns - ns mergers have shown the subrelativistic ejection of ns material by tidal torque and/or shock heating with the mass of @xmath12 - @xmath13 and the speed of @xmath14 - @xmath15 in the unit of the speed of light @xmath16 for a wide range of parameters , where @xmath17 is the solar mass .",
    "mass ejection via magnetically driven winds @xcite and neutrino - driven winds @xcite may be also possible .",
    "the shock waves accelerated by a steep density gradient at a ns surface in the merging phase can also drive relativistic ejecta @xcite . a relativistic wind from a rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized ns produced in the post - merger stage",
    "may additionally inject energy to the ejecta , as discussed in the context of the extended emission of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mass ejection from bh - ns mergers has also been studied and the tidal mass ejection is also expected @xcite .",
    "the general relativistic simulations of bh - ns mergers show that the mass ejection is highly anisotropic with @xmath18 - @xmath19 and @xmath20 - @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "ejecta from nsbs are inevitably neutron - rich , and can drive r - process nucleosyntheses @xcite .",
    "the radioactive decay of r - process elements powers transient events , so - called macronovae or kilonovae @xcite .",
    "macronovae have been expected to be bright in optical bands at a few days after the mergers of nsbs @xcite .",
    "recent studies with detailed opacity treatment including elements heavier than iron groups have indicated that macronovae are longer and softer events than those previously thought , over a week in infrared bands @xcite .",
    "a recent near - infrared observation of short grb 130603b by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) at a post - burst phase finds radiation consistent with a macronova @xcite .",
    "although this radiation can be also interpreted as an afterglow , this observation implies mass ejection with @xmath21 and @xmath22 if this is from a macronova .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the subrelativistic ejecta is very similar to that of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the ejecta expand freely in the initial phase @xcite .",
    "then , they start to strongly interact with the interstellar medium ( ism ) and to be decelerated when the mass of the swept - up ism becomes comparable to the ejecta mass , entering into the sedov - taylor phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of nsb remnants is generally faster than that of snrs due to smaller ejected mass and the higher velocity of the ejecta .",
    "note that the word of remnants is used for the remnants generated by interactions between the ejecta and the ism , analogously to snrs , not nss or bhs produced by mergers throughout this paper .",
    "a fraction of the kinetic energy of the ejecta is converted to the energy of particles , i.e. , the particles are accelerated at a forward shock in the remnants . in the magnetized medium , accelerated relativistic electrons radiate synchrotron photons in radio bands @xcite .    in this paper , we show that relativistic electrons accelerated at the forward shocks of nsb remnants can also emit x - rays and gamma rays in the framework of a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "emission by ssc is inevitably present in a magnetized system with relativistic electrons .",
    "the ejecta of a ns - ns merger expand to the entire directions ; ns material expands to the equatorial plane mainly due to tidal interaction , and it also expands along the rotational axis due to shock heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the velocities of the former and latter components is @xmath23 in fully general relativistic simulations @xcite , while the former component is dominant , i.e. , anisotropy is larger , in newtonian simulations ( i.e. , ) due to weaker gravity in the vicinity of the nss than general relativity . in both cases , the expansion of the ejecta is reasonably approximated to be isotropic .",
    "a recent simulation revealing that radioactive heating quickly smooths out inhomogeneities in the initial mass distribution also supports this approximation @xcite .",
    "although ns - ns mergers could also produce the relativistic ejecta by the shock breakout @xcite , we consider only the subrelativistic ejecta in this study . on the other hand ,",
    "the ejecta of a bh - ns merger expand anisotropically at the initial phase .",
    "then , when they are decelerated by interactions with the ism , they start to expand in a nearly isotropic manner because their lateral expansion speed is roughly the sound speed comparable with the speed of the shock .",
    "thus , we emphasize that the model based on the approximation of the isotropic expansion in this paper is also applicable to the cases of bh - ns mergers .",
    "it is worth noting that there are few models for x - ray and higher energy emission associated with gws .",
    "isotropic emission is eagerly anticipated to find electromagnetic counterparts that help the localization of gw sources because the sgrb jet , if any , is off - axis in most cases and not able to be detected .",
    "x - ray emission in the inspiral phase is proposed , which may be precursors of sgrbs @xcite . the relativistic ejecta driven by accelerating shock waves generated just after the collision of nss produce non - thermal electrons via shock acceleration , emitting synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron emission reaches x - ray energies and is radiated almost isotropically because the ejecta expand nearly isotropically .",
    "another model is the early `` afterglow '' of a ns - ns merger lasting several thousand seconds powered by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the magnetized wind from a rapidly - spinning massive ns @xcite .",
    "this model predicts a large opening angle of emission compared to sgrbs ( @xmath24@xmath25 for a reasonable parameter choice @xcite ) , which is determined by the balance between the pressure of the magnetar wind nebula and ejecta . also , high - energy neutrinos from magnetar wind nebulae are proposed @xcite .",
    "compared to these models our model is based on more conservative mass ejection , i.e. , dynamical mass ejection , confirmed by numerical simulations . also , this study is the first estimation of inverse - compton - scattered photons for isotropic radiation .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows .",
    "we start with the description of our model in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "then , we show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of nsb merger remnants ( nsbmrs ) and investigate their dependence on parameters related to particle acceleration in section [ sec : results ] . the detectability of the emission is discussed with particular attention to possible backgrounds in section [ sec : detectability ] .",
    "then , we discuss the dependence of the sed on parameters of the environments and the ejecta properties of the merger , and examine possible hadronic emission in section [ sec : discussion ] . then",
    ", this study is summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "consider mass @xmath26 dynamically ejected isotropically from a ns - ns merger with the speed of @xmath27 .",
    "the ejecta initially expand freely and isotropically , and sweep up the surrounding ism with the number density @xmath28 . when the total mass of the swept ism becomes comparable with @xmath26 , the ejecta",
    "are started to be decelerated and the expansion enters into the sedov - taylor phase .",
    "a strong forward shock is generated where particles are accelerated .",
    "the deceleration radius is @xmath29 and the corresponding deceleration time @xmath30 is @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 cm , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the proton mass . in the case of a bh - ns merger , the deceleration radius and time may be modified by a factor of @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the solid angle where ns material is initially ejected .",
    "this factor is small , only @xmath38 according to general relativistic simulations @xcite .",
    "thus , although the calculation results below assume isotropic mass ejection , they can be reasonably applied to the bh - ns merger cases just by replacing parameters with those of bh - ns mergers . throughout this paper",
    "we estimate emission from accelerated electrons at @xmath39 when it is the most luminous .",
    "let us roughly estimate the bolometric flux of emission from a nsbmr occurred at @xmath40 mpc from the earth .",
    "we assume that relativistic electrons have a fraction @xmath41 of the total kinetic energy of the ejecta @xmath42 .",
    "if the energy of the electrons is converted into radiation at @xmath39 , the bolometric flux is @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 mpc .",
    "this numerical value is well above the sensitivity of active x - ray telescopes such as _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , the _ x - ray multi - mirror mission newton _ ( _ xmm_-_newton _ ) , _ suzaku _ x - ray telescope in soft x - ray ranges for point - like sources . also , it is comparable with the sensitivity of the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) in the very - high - energy ( @xmath46 gev ) range @xcite .",
    "the distance of @xmath47 mpc is within the horizon of aligo and adv to ns - ns and bh - ns binaries @xcite . given a ns - ns merger rate per galaxy of @xmath48 yr@xmath11 from known ns - ns mergers in the milky way and the number density of galaxies of @xmath49 mpc@xmath50 , the number of ns - ns binary merger remnants within the distance of @xmath51 can be estimated as @xmath52 therefore , high - energy emission from nsbmrs may become good observational targets for these instruments if they produce photons in the high - energy bands .",
    "thus , we consider nsbmrs within 100 mpc throughout this paper that allow us to neglect cosmological effects .",
    "the detection of such high - energy photons can confirm that electrons are accelerated .",
    "we calculate the broadband sed of nsbmrs in the framework of a ssc model with a numerical code developed in @xcite . in the ssc model synchrotron radiation and ssc emission",
    "are calculated based on a given electron spectrum and the strength of magnetic fields .",
    "the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of cosmic microwave background photons and bremsstrahlung are negligible in the range surveyed in this study .",
    "the model parameters defined in this section are summarized in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the table also exhibits the fiducial parameters used in this study for ns - ns merger remnants . in the cases of bh - ns merger remnants",
    ", a larger value of the ejected mass @xmath26 ( @xmath53 ) can be allowed @xcite .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath54 of internal energy released at the forward shock is converted to the energy of magnetic fields downstream of the shock .",
    "rankine - hugoniot relations indicate that the released internal energy density is @xmath55 for a non - relativistic gas , and therefore the strength of the magnetic fields is @xmath56 where @xmath57 .    the spectrum of accelerated electrons at injection",
    "is assumed to be a power - law function with the index of @xmath58 in the range from the minimum lorentz factor at injection @xmath59 and the maximum lorentz factor of electrons @xmath60 following diffusive shock acceleration @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the lorentz factor of electrons and @xmath63 is the normalization factor of the total number of electrons .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor of electrons can be estimated by equating the time scale of particle acceleration and the minimum time scale among the dynamical timescale @xmath64 in this study@xmath65 and cooling time scales .",
    "the acceleration time scale is estimated in the framework of diffusive shock acceleration for a parallel shock in the test particle approximation as ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath66 and the larmor radius of the particles @xmath67 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the electron mass , @xmath70 is the absolute electric charge of an electron , and @xmath71 is called a gyrofactor , representing particle acceleration efficiency ; a larger @xmath72 results in less efficient acceleration because particles require more time to go back and forth between the downstream and upstream of the shock .",

    "cta can detect gamma rays from nsbmrs within @xmath140 mpc , if such a parameter set is realized . in this case , a very sharp x - ray spectrum , which is detectable , is predicted in soft x - ray ranges because of the maximum energy of electrons high enough to produce gamma rays up to the cta energy range .",
    "when the radiative efficiency of gamma rays is sufficiently high , the ics energy - loss of electrons dominates the synchrotron energy - loss , resulting in the sed peak energy of the ssc emission lower than @xmath131 gev .",
    "this enables the peak energy to approach @xmath135 gev where the _",

    "so far , we have considered dynamical mass ejection from nsb mergers .",
    "however , it is possible that magnetically / neutrino - driven winds in the post - merging phase can additionally powers the ejecta . here",
    ", we examine one of such possibilities ; a rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized massive ns produced by a ns - ns merger drives ejecta if the equation of state of nss is so stiff that the merged ns does not collapse to a black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the massive ns initially has the rotation energy of @xmath146 where @xmath147 g @xmath148 is the moment of inertia and @xmath149 s is the initial spin period .",
    "this huge energy is released within a characteristic time scale , i.e. , spin - down time scale , @xmath150 here , @xmath151 g is the strength of the magnetic field at a pole and @xmath152 cm is the radius of the massive ns .",
    "thus , the total kinetic energy of ejecta can increase by more than one order of magnitude , if the released rotation energy is converted into the kinetic energy before @xmath30 ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mag ] demonstrates the sed of ns - ns merger remnants in several cases of @xmath145 which corresponds to @xmath154 erg and @xmath155 years .",
    "the ejecta expand with mildly relativistic speed of the lorentz factor of @xmath156 .",

    "such a huge energy input into ejecta and the large energy fraction of accelerated electrons enables us to detect gamma rays even for a distance of @xmath40 mpc .",
    "thus , the detection of gamma rays from such distant ns - ns merger remnants implies the formation of rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized nss .",
    "the internal pressure of the massive nss , which depends on the equation of state , should be high enough to support them against gravitational collapse after angular momentum redistribution and neutrino cooling .",
    "thus , the detection of gamma rays may also allow us to constrain the equation of state of nss with the mass of the massive nss inferred from gw observations .",
    "the huge energy input allows us to find ns - ns merger remnants by surveys not only in gamma rays by the _",

    "background emission from galaxies hosting nsbmrs could interfere their identification , unless observational instruments spatially resolve them or they are located outside the host galaxies .",
    "temporal coincidence with gw radiation does not allow background - free observations for nsbmrs because they are long - lasting over years . in this section",
    "we discuss the identification of nsbmrs in optical , x - ray , and gamma - ray bands with particular emphasis on possible background emission .",
    "the detectability in radio bands is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "radiation from the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) of host galaxies could be a prime competitor to nsbmrs in terms of luminosities .",
    "however , they are less important background sources than other sources because agn bright enough to harbor emission from nsbmrs are rare .",
    "thus , we do not consider agn as backgrounds .",
    "when the galactic nuclei of host galaxies are not so active like the milky way and other low - luminosity agn , astrophysical objects and/or phenomena in the host galaxies are primary backgrounds for nsbmrs .",
    "snrs , to which a similar model as nsbmrs is applied , are not severe background sources , although the kinetic energy of ejecta is comparable ( @xmath165 erg ) .",
    "the deceleration time @xmath30 of snrs is @xmath0 yr due to the larger mass and slower speed of ejecta . as a result ,",
    "the flux of a snr is roughly @xmath166 times smaller than that of a nsbmr . since",
    "a supernova rate is @xmath49 yr@xmath11 for galaxies like the milky way , only a few snrs could contribute to the total flux of snrs at a time slice .",
    "the afterglow of the sgrb associated with a nsbmr is another potential background if sgrbs originate from nsb mergers as have been suggested .",
    "although a sgrb produce highly beamed emission , its afterglow might contribute to the accompanying merger remnant after the significant deceleration of sgrb ejecta even for an off - axis event .",
    "however , the total energy of the afterglow is @xmath167 ( @xmath168)@xmath169 erg , where @xmath170 is the opening angle of the sgrb jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is much smaller than that of the nsb ejecta .",
    "therefore , sgrb afterglows also do not contribute as a background .",
    "different objects or phenomena dominantly contribute as primary backgrounds in different wavelengths .",
    "although the contents of galaxies depend on their types , the type of galaxies in which nsb mergers predominantly occur is unclear because our knowledge on the mergers is inferred from firmly identified ns - ns binaries in the milky way .",
    "the observed host galaxies of sgrbs can answer this problem if sgrbs are driven by nsb mergers as believed .",
    "however , recent observations have revealed that sgrbs are associated with both early - type ( i.e. , elliptical ) and late - type ( i.e. , spiral and irregular ) galaxies @xcite , supported by theoretical population studies ( e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "hence , we consider both possibilities to discuss possible backgrounds .    to summarize in advance , nsbmrs are expected to be detected in x - ray bands .",
    "the identification of the optical emission requires good spacial resolution of telescopes .",
    "gamma - ray emission can exceed possible background emission if its flux is enough to reach the sensitivity of the telescopes .",
    "the superposition of stellar emission is a primary background .",
    "hereafter galaxies without strong active nuclei and prominent starburst activity are called normal galaxies .",

    "approximating the cross - section of the galaxy to be @xmath177 , the flux of starlight from a small region around the remnant with the area of @xmath178 is @xmath179 erg @xmath115 s@xmath11 where @xmath180 arcsec and @xmath181 kpc .",
    "therefore , optical telescopes with angular resolution of less than @xmath182 such as keck telescopes , subaru telescope , and hst , can identify synchrotron radiation from the remnant at @xmath40 mpc in optical bands in the high gamma - ray flux cases ( figures [ fig : gamma ] and [ fig : mag ] ) . in the fiducial case a nsbmr at @xmath40 mpc is fainter than the limited magnitude of these telescopes , @xmath183 erg @xmath115 s@xmath11 .",

    "@xcite may relax the requirement of angular resolution , if sgrbs originate from nsb mergers .",
    "the primary background is x - ray binaries .",
    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; @xmath186 ) are associated with old stellar population and are an good indicator of the total stellar mass ; lmxbs are known to be the main x - ray sources of early - type galaxies . on the other hand , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs : @xmath187 )",

    "if @xmath188 is close to @xmath201 erg s@xmath11 , their x - ray flux is comparable with the flux of the total flux of x - ray binaries . even in this case",
    "the observations of the temporal evolution of nsbmrs would allow us to identify nsbmrs .",
    "galactic diffuse gamma rays are the main background for identification .",
    "the diffuse gamma rays primarily originate from cosmic - ray protons accelerated by snrs .",
    "they are produced by cosmic rays propagating in galactic space via the decay of neutral pions produced by interactions with the ism .",
    "since star - forming activity is already over in early - type galaxies , diffuse gamma - ray emission from early - type galaxies is not considered .",
    "the diffuse gamma - ray emission of the milky way has been estimated by solving the propagation of cosmic rays ( e.g. , using the galprop code @xcite ) .",
    "recent calculations required to reproduce the observational result of the _ fermi_-lat have revealed the diffuse gamma - ray luminosity of the milky way is @xmath204 erg s@xmath11 above 200 mev in which @xmath205 decay of cosmic ray protons dominates @xcite .",
    "another late - type galaxy m31 is also detected by the _",
    "fermi_-lat , and its sed can be explained by a scaled sed of the galactic diffuse emission down to @xmath206 erg s@xmath11 above 200 mev .",
    "interestingly , ref . found that the number flux of photons above 100 mev correlates with the star formation rates of local group galaxies including several starburst galaxies .",
    "assuming the shape of the sed of these galaxies is similar , this result indicates a correlation between gamma - ray luminosity above 100 mev and their star formation rates .",
    "if this relation is applicable for all normal late - type galaxies and starburst galaxies , the luminosity of diffuse gamma rays is @xmath207 erg s@xmath11 even for strong starburst galaxies with star formation rates up to @xmath208 yr@xmath11 such as m82 , which indicates the gamma - ray flux of @xmath209 erg @xmath115 s@xmath11 where @xmath210 erg s@xmath11 is the gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "thus , gamma rays from nsbmrs dominates the diffuse gamma rays of its host galaxy in the high gamma - ray flux cases .",
    "in section [ sec : results ] we discussed the dependence of parameters related to particle acceleration under the fixed parameters on the ejecta of nsb mergers , i.e. , their mass @xmath26 and speed @xmath139 , and their environment , i.e. , ism density @xmath28 .",
    "however , these parameters are also uncertain at present and should also be determined by observations .",
    "the detection of the nine independent characteristic features of nsbmrs allows us to infer all the nine model parameters ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) . in the fiducial case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fid ] ) as an example , there are four characteristic frequencies in the sed , i.e. , the frequencies of the sed breaks by synchrotron self - absorption and synchrotron cooling ( @xmath158 ) , the roll - off frequency @xmath211 , and the frequency of the sed peak of the ssc emission .",
    "two characteristic fluxes exist , i.e. , flux at the sed peaks of the synchrotron radiation and ssc emission .",

    "the light curves of nsbmrs , which have not been discussed in detail , can determine @xmath30 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies of nsbmrs can determine the distance @xmath51 .",
    "the observations of these nine features can in principle determine all the model parameters .",
    "thus , the multi - wavelength observations of nsbmrs are essentially important to understand the physical nature of nsbmrs , nsbs , and their environments . in this section ,",
    "we provide the dependence of the nsbmr sed on the parameters of the ejecta of nsb mergers ( @xmath26 and @xmath139 ) and their environment ( @xmath28 ) in an analytic way to help parameter estimations from observations .",
    "if electrons are accelerated , we expect that cosmic rays are also accelerated in nsbmrs .",
    "it is interesting to consider hadronic emission as well as the possible contributions to the observed cosmic rays , regarding nsbmrs as a new class of cosmic - ray accelerators .",
    "we also discuss these topics in this section .",
    "the number density of the ism in the vicinity of nsb merger has been set to be @xmath212 cm@xmath50 throughout this paper .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that ns - ns systems firmly confirmed and expected to be merged within a hubble time , namely b@xmath214+@xmath215 @xcite , b@xmath216+@xmath217 @xcite , j@xmath218@xmath219 @xcite , and j@xmath220@xmath221 @xcite , are located in the disk of the milky way in which the typical density of the ism is @xmath222 cm@xmath50 . on the other hand , there is a possibility that ns - ns mergers occur in smaller densities because 1 ) there is a ns - ns binary in a globular cluster , namely b@xmath223+@xmath224c @xcite , and 2 ) the ambient ism density of a significant fraction of sgrbs has been inferred to be @xmath225@xmath226 cm@xmath50 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , there is no observational information on the ism density around bh - ns merger .",
    "thus , it is useful to give the scaling laws of sed on the ism density @xmath28 .",
    "when electrons are in the slow cooling regime and are predominantly cooled by synchrotron radiation , the frequency of the synchrotron peak @xmath158 is moved following @xmath227 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : syn_brk ] ) and the flux of synchrotron radiation at the peak is scaled proportional to @xmath228 .",
    "the flux becomes lower in a lower ism density environment .",
    "we can estimate or constrain the ism density in the vicinity of the nsbs through these dependence .",
    "this also allows us to test the nsb hypothesis of the sgrb origin by comparing the inferred density with the circumburst density of sgrbs .      according to simulations ,",
    "the parameters of ejecta , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath139 , depend on the equation of state of nss which is uncertain @xcite .",
    "the mass of ejecta @xmath26 may be larger than @xmath229 up to @xmath230 and @xmath139 is distributed from @xmath119 to @xmath231 for ns - ns mergers @xcite .",
    "the ejected mass may be more for bh - ns mergers @xcite .",
    "a recent observation of grb 130603b implies @xmath21 and @xmath22 if the post - burst radiation is interpreted as a macronova .",
    "when the synchrotron cooling of electrons is dominant in the slow cooling regime , the frequency of the synchrotron peak @xmath158 is scaled according to @xmath232 ( eq . [ eq : syn_brk ] ) and its flux at @xmath104 is proportional to @xmath233 . here",
    ", we can learn that the flux of nsbmrs is very sensitive to @xmath139 .",
    "an analogy with snrs indicates that a forward shock in nsbmrs can accelerate cosmic rays as well as electrons .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor of the cosmic rays with their atomic number @xmath234 and nuclear mass number @xmath235 is estimated following the same discussion as electrons , @xmath236^{1/2 }   \\right).\\ ] ] here , the nuclear mass is approximately @xmath237 and @xmath35 is the proton mass . regarded as a function of @xmath72 , the maximum lorentz factor",
    "is numerically represented as @xmath238 where @xmath239 since the value of @xmath72 is more than unity by definition , the dynamical time scale always limits the maximum lorentz factor of cosmic rays under our choice of parameters .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor corresponds to @xmath240 ev for protons and @xmath241 ev for irons , respectively .",
    "therefore , nsbmrs can be sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays above the _ knee _ up to the _ ankle _ in the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "since cosmic rays are accelerated , gamma - ray emission with the hadronic origin is an interesting possibility as in the cases of snrs . here",
    ", let us estimate the flux of hadronic gamma - ray emission through the interaction of accelerated protons with the strongly shocked ism .",
    "since the protons travel a distance of @xmath242 at @xmath39 , the optical depth of @xmath243 interactions downstream of the forward shock is @xmath244 , where @xmath245 @xmath115 is the cross section of an inelastic @xmath243 collision .",
    "the maximally achievable bolometric flux is @xmath246 erg @xmath115 s@xmath11 , where @xmath247 is the energy fraction of accelerated protons to the total kinetic energy of ejecta and @xmath248 is the energy conversion efficiency of protons to gamma rays in a @xmath243 collision .",
    "thus , gamma rays from @xmath243 collisions do not compete with the leptonic gamma rays at @xmath39 .",
    "the relative contribution of gamma rays from @xmath243 collisions increases at later time because @xmath249 is proportional to the time of the system as long as protons are confined in the system while high - energy electrons are cooled .",
    "also , we expect that the flux of high - energy neutrinos is similar to that of the hadronic gamma rays .",
    "we have shown that electrons accelerated at forward shocks in nsbmrs can produce high energy emission in x - rays and gamma - ray bands .",
    "the x - rays are detectable even by the current generation x - ray telescopes at @xmath39 under the fiducial parameter set ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the detection of the high - energy radiation reveals the acceleration of high - energy particles in nsbmrs .",
    "also , the observation of the radiation allows us to test the nsb merger hypothesis of sgrbs through the comparison between the estimated ism density surrounding the mergers and the circumburst density inferred by the observations of sgrb afterglows .",
    "we also suggest that nsbmrs are the accelerators of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays beyond the _ knee _ up to the _ ankle _ in the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "we find that the flux of gamma rays originating from these cosmic rays is much lower than that of the leptonic gamma rays at @xmath39 .",
    "nearby nsbmrs ( @xmath250 mpc ) may be also detected by the _",
    "fermi_-lat and cta if the radiative efficiency of electrons is high enough at @xmath39 ( see figure [ fig : gamma ] ) . in order to enhance the radiative efficiency a narrow electron spectrum centered at the cooling lorentz factor of electrons @xmath88 is required .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration , believed to work in snrs , is difficult to predict such a narrow spectrum .",
    "thus , the detection of gamma rays implies an alternative mechanism like stochastic acceleration as motivated by snrs .",
    "if the ejecta are powered by another source , i.e. , a magnetically / neutrino driven wind in addition to the dynamical mass ejection , the flux of radiation from nsbmrs can be enhanced .",
    "we demonstrated that ns - ns merger remnants even at @xmath40 mpc are detectable in gamma rays , for example , if the ejecta are powered by a rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized massive ns born through the mergers and the radiative efficiency of electrons is high .",
    "the detection of such distant ns - ns merger remnants by gamma rays implies the formation of such massive nss .",
    "the massive nss must be supported by internal pressure .",
    "thus , the detection may also allow us to constrain the equation of state of nss through the mass of the massive nss inferred by the observations of gws .",
