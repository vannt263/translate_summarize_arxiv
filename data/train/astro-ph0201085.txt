    "the interpretation of the ratio  for the  average normal \" galaxy is straightforward , if we consider most likely that ib / c progenitors are wolf rayet stars , whose hydrogen envelope has been fully lost ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the latter stars may result from the evolution of the most massive stars ( m@xmath3940m@xmath40)@xcite or from less massive primary component of binary systems after the mass transfer ( eg . table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "assuming a constant star formation rate during the last 100  myr , and adopting the same initial mass function ( imf ) for single stars and binary components , the ratio  is simply given by @xmath41 where m is the initial mass of the star , the index i refers to all channels leading to type ib / c , j to the formation of type ii  and w s are relative weights that depend on the overall binary fraction and on the relative frequency of case a , b and c in the binary evolution .",
    "the expected variation of the ratio  is shown in the upper panel of fig.[fig : bin ] , as a function of the binary fraction . to this purpose",
    "we have adopted a salpeter imf up to 120  m@xmath40 , and the values of m@xmath42 and m@xmath43 were taken from table 2 of @xcite ; the latter authors also assume that all stars more massive than 40  m@xmath40 explode as type ib / c , while single stars and secondary stars less massive than 40  m@xmath40 explode as type ii .",
    "we have considered several cases : ( a ) all binaries evolve as case a ( dotted line ) ; ( b ) all binaries evolve as case b ( dashed line ) ; ( c ) case a and b share the same relative weight ( solid line ) ; ( d ) as in ( c ) but in the case that only binary members explode as type ib / c  ( lower dot long - dashed line ) ; ( e ) as in ( c ) but in this case the initial mass for ib / c  has been lowered from 40  m@xmath40 to 25  m@xmath40 ( upper dot short - dashed line ) .",
    "the horizontal line represents the observed average value for the normal galaxy sample ( cs ) .",
    "we did not account for case c evolution because it is considered to be a very rare event and as such it will only slightly modify the picture depicted in fig.[fig : bin ] .",
    "the fraction does not appear much affected by the precise details of the binary evolution . for normal spirals ,",
    "the observed ratio is consistent with a scenario where the progenitors of type ib / c  are wolf rayet stars , either evolved from stars initially more massive than 40  m@xmath44 or from less massive primary components of binary systems .",
    "the data support a universal salpeter imf and indicate a binary fraction of about the 50% . a significantly higher binary fraction ( about 75% )",
    "is required if one insists that only binary evolution give rise to type ib / c .",
    "as discussed by wellstein & langer ( 1999 ) , uncertainties in the mass- loss rate , convection treatment and chemical composition may affect both the upper mass limit ( 40  m@xmath40 ) leading to type ii  in single stars , and the mass transfer phase in binary evolution .",
    "fortunately , uncertainties leading to different type ib and type ic  events are not relevant here , because we are considering their combined frequency .      from table 1 and fig.[fig : bin ] , we also infer that things could be markedly different in seyfert galaxies , where the observed ratio is @xmath11 .",
    "several seyfert galaxies , of which a sizable fraction belongs to strongly interacting systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath1 2/3 of seyfert 2 ) , show significant , or even dominant ( over the active nucleus luminosity ) circum - nuclear star formation .",
    "a recent  narrow band survey @xcite found that about 1/2 of seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 show maximum value of region emission in the circum - nuclear regions .",
    "this study of the radial distribution of  regions in normal , liner and seyfert galaxies agrees with a large number of detailed spectroscopic and imaging studies of seyfert galaxies .",
    "consistently , the radial distribution of  appears to be more strongly peaked in seyfert galaxies than in normal galaxies in several samples @xcite as well as in our own .",
    "however , enhancement of star formation rate in the inner galactic regions can not explain the relative excess of type ib / c   found in seyfert galaxies .    the observed radial gradients of chemical composition @xcite and the central concentration of type ib / c  in seyfert galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distnorm ] ) imply that ib / c  could be typically produced in 2 @xmath45 regions in seyfert and in @xmath45  regions in normal galaxies . because mass loss increases with metallicity and , consequently , the minimum initial mass for single wolf rayet production decreases ,  could be a function of metallicity . as shown by model ( d ) in the upper panel of fig.[fig : bin ] , could increase by the 100% if the minimum mass for ib / c production decreases from 40 m@xmath44 to 25 m@xmath44 . however , this is not very likely because mass - loss is also sensitive to the luminosity and the latter is a strong function of the initial mass @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation is that star formation in circum - nuclear and disk regions of seyfert galaxies is a high _ binary fraction_. if we assume that all young stars are in binaries and undergo mass transfer during their life , we would obtain @xmath460.6 .",
    "this value , though lower than the observed one , would double the expected relative frequency of binary stars with respect to the normal galaxies .",
    "inspection of table 1 shows that the observed ratio n(ia)/n@xmath29   is 0.63 for the normal galaxies and rises to 1 in the seyfert sample .",
    "would this ratio be free from selection effects , it would strongly indicate a larger probability of assembling binary systems .",
    "however , the magnitude at maximum and light - curve of type ia  is very different from that of core - collapse .",
    "this makes the comparison of the ratio n(ia ) over number of core - collapse  _ meaningless _ if not accompanied by a careful examination of the relative control times which , unfortunately can not be done here .    an appealing alternative is constituted by a `` top - loaded '' imf . the high efficiency at which gas is reprocessed into stars is often taken as an indication in favor of a top - heavy initial mass function in compact starbursts e.g. @xcite .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bin ] depicts the effect of changing the imf exponent x , where @xmath47 and x=1.35 corresponds to the salpeter imf . the value of   increases as the imf becomes flatter .",
    "the observed value in seyfert galaxies would indicate a very flat imf , above 8 @xmath48 .",
    "we must however stress that conclusive evidence in favor of an imf slope significantly flatter than the salpeter one has not been found in external galaxies , not even in wolf - rayet and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the necessity of a top heavy imf disappears if , in seyferts , we are observing a very young burst of star formation . to illustrate this effect we show in the lower panel of fig.[fig : bin ] the run of the ratio  with the binary fraction , for different burst ages and a constant sfr .",
    "if the starburst is sufficiently old , let us say of age @xmath49 50 myr , then there may exist evolved stars with any mass between the upper imf limit and the critical mass m@xmath468  @xmath48 for core collapse .",
    "but if the burst is younger , then all stars with initial mass below a given value ",
    "m(@xmath22 )  are still on the main sequence and only stars more massive than m(@xmath50 ) can explode .",
    "different curves in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bin ] are labeled by the duration of the burst , in myr .",
    "a salpeter imf is consistent with the observed @xmath51  if the star formation episode is younger than @xmath1 13 myr .",
    "this value depends only slightly on the assumed chemical composition .",
    "we found that normal galaxies show @xmath520.27 , a value consistent with the ratio of absolute supernova rates in snu . with the caveat of our still - limited sample size ,",
    "seyfert galaxies show a peculiar distribution of supernova types , with higher frequency of type ib / c  ( @xmath53 ) than non - active galaxies .",
    "these finding are consistent with a `` normal ''  rate related to secular star formation as far as non - active galaxies are concerned .",
    "a scenario where wolf rayet stars are produced by the most massive stars ( @xmath3940m@xmath44 ) and by less massive ( 8m@xmath44@xmath54m@xmath5440m@xmath44 ) primary stars of binary systems that soon or later undergo mass - transfer , reproduces fairly well the observed ratio , without particular assumptions on the imf .",
    "a large type ib / c rate with respect to type ii , as found for seyferts , is a new result .",
    "we consider several explanations as possible , namely a lowering of the upper mass limit for type ii precursors due to a higher metallicity , a very high _ binary fraction _ , a top heavy imf and a young age of the burst of star formation . while metallicity is likely to act in the observed direction ,",
    "because it enhances the mass - loss rate , the amplitude of the observed effect may not be explained .",
    "even if the  value found for seyfert galaxies needs confirmation with better statistics , it is interesting to note that an high could be associated with the enhanced sfr in the circum - nuclear and regions of galaxies hosting seyfert nuclei , especially of type 2 nuclei @xcite . a young age of the burst of star formation  probably triggered by interaction with a massive companion galaxy @xcite  is a likely cause of the high  observed among seyfert galaxies , as it requires the minor number of assumptions .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with an evolutionary sequence leading from ir - luminous starbursts , to seyfert 2 and eventually to seyfert 1 galaxies , with the youngest seyfert 1 being the ones of lowest intrinsic power and/or the ones most heavily obscured @xcite .",
