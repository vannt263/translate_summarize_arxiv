    "the dynamics of the pacific ocean , within a band of about @xmath0 latitude from the equator , is characterised by a pronounced stratification , greater than anywhere else in the ocean ; see @xcite .",
    "a very sharp layer separates a shallow layer of relatively warm water ( and so less dense ) near the surface , from a deeper layer of denser , colder water .",
    "since these distinct top and bottom layers differ by density and temperature , the sharp layer between them is termed _ pycnocline _ and sometimes _ thermocline_. the difference in density across the thermocline is about 1% . in addition , underlying non - uniform currents occur , see e.g. @xcite . in a band",
    "approximately 300 km wide about the equator , the underlying currents are highly depth - dependent : in a sub - surface layer , typically extending no more than about 100 m down , there is a westward drift that is driven by the prevailing trade winds ; just below this there lies the equatorial undercurrent ( euc ) , an eastward jet whose core resides on the thermocline . below the euc , the motion dies out rapidly so",
    "that , at depths in excess of about 240 m , there is an abyssal layer of essentially still water .",
    "variety of waves in this region is observed , including long waves with wavelengths exceeding 100 km @xcite .",
    "there is ample evidence of large - amplitude internal waves , with relatively short wavelengths ( typically a few hundreds of metres ) and periods about 5 - 10 min ; see @xcite .",
    "we examine a simplified model of two - dimensional internal geophysical waves propagating along the equator .",
    "although the coriolis force plays the role of a waveguide keeping the euc and the occurring waves to propagate along the equator ( and to remain essentially two dimensional ) its impact on the dynamics of this two dimensional motion is rather small . thus , for simplicity we neglect coriolis forces .",
    "the gravitationally induced internal waves propagate on the common interface ( thermocline / pycnocline ) between the upper and lower media of different densities .",
    "( we assume for simplicity that both media have constant densities . ) in physical reality the ocean surface will have surface waves .",
    "we neglect the surface waves and hence consider the top surface to be a flat boundary like a rigid lid . for long and intermediate surface waves coupled with internal waves such an approximation",
    "is justified , cf . @xcite .",
    "the boundary underneath is by an impermeable flat bed , which is a relevant approximation for the ocean bed , in the equatorial pacific .",
    "recently , explicit nonlinear solutions for equatorially trapped waves were obtained in the lagrangian framework , see @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , solutions for the internal waves have been described in @xcite . however ,",
    "both these types of solution are restricted to relatively short wavelengths , and they are realistic representations of the flow only for the region near the surface and in the neighbourhood of the thermocline , respectively .    by examining the governing equations of the system we provide a hamiltonian formulation of the equations and with a variable transformation we show that it has a canonical hamiltonian structure .",
    "the hamiltonian formulation of surface waves over deep water has been noticed by zakharov @xcite and since then the hamiltonian models have been used extensively for various approximations with linear and nonlinear pdes , e.g. @xcite .    as per figure 1",
    "we define the lower medium @xmath1 as the domain @xmath2 , the upper medium @xmath3 as the domain @xmath4 and the entire system @xmath5 as the domain @xmath6 where @xmath7 describes the elevation of the common interface .",
    "the subscript @xmath8 will be used to denote evaluation at the common interface .",
    "the shear flow in a general form is @xmath9    and moreover @xmath10 is a continuous function for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath13 .",
    "+ the constants @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are positive ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we use the subscript notation @xmath18 to represent the lower and upper media respectively .",
    "the next assumption is that the pycnocline is always in the strip @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 for all @xmath21 so that all internal waves take place in this _",
    "strip_.    the velocities in the two media are decomposed into wave and current parts : @xmath22    where without any ambiguity @xmath23    the non - lateral velocity flow , with propagation in the positive @xmath24-direction , is given by @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the respective constant densities of the lower and upper media and stability is given by the condition that @xmath28     and @xmath3 with densities @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the shear profile @xmath29 is provided qualitatively .",
    "the five layers i ",
    "v correspond to the description in @xcite .",
    "the important feature is that the wave motion takes place in layers ii and iii where the vorticity is zero and @xmath29 is constant . in the other layers @xmath29 is continuous . ]",
    "we assume that for large @xmath30 the amplitude of @xmath31 attenuates and hence make the following assumptions @xmath32",
    "we write euler s equation as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the pressure at a depth @xmath35 , @xmath36 is ( constant ) atmospheric pressure , @xmath37 is the dynamic pressure due to the wave motion , @xmath38 is the acceleration due to gravity ( where @xmath35 points in the opposite direction to the center of gravity ) , @xmath39 is the force due to gravity per unit mass , and the coriolis force is neglected for simplicity .",
    "its effect is not significant and also it is important to keep the waves one - dimensional .    applying equations ( [ phi_def ] ) and noticing that in the strip @xmath40 we have @xmath41 and velocities @xmath42 and thus there is no vorticity in the strip , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "the equations can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 . at the interface @xmath46",
    "therefore we have the conservation law ( bernoulli condition ) at the interface @xmath47 writing the bernoulli condition in terms of wave potentials @xmath48 only @xmath49 the difference with the case without current is only the shift @xmath50 this also suggests the definition of @xmath51 as the interface velocity potential and hence the definition of ] @xmath52 we will also use the following kinematic boundary conditions : @xmath53 noting that @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where the subscripts @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote evaluation at the bottom ( lower boundary ) and lid ( upper boundary ) respectively . again",
    "we observe only a shift @xmath58 in comparison with the case @xmath59 : @xmath60 therefore the time evolution of the variables , describing the dynamics of the internal waves @xmath61 does not depend on the shear outside the strip ; the constant flow in the strip leads only to a velocity shift with the velocity of the current @xmath15 ( in comparison to the currents free case ) .",
    "we will analyse the phenomenon from the hamiltonian point of view .",
    "if we consider the system under study as an irrotational system the hamiltonian , @xmath62 , is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies as :    @xmath63    we try to express the hamiltonian in terms of @xmath64 .",

    "the integral @xmath67    gives an irrelevant constant , which can be absorbed by a proper renormalization and does not produce any dynamic terms , since the average elevation of the thermocline by definition is zero at @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 the integrals over the upper layer produce    @xmath70 and altogether the kinetic terms produce the extra term    @xmath71    this quantity itself is a conservation law , related to the energy of the overall translation of the system by a velocity @xmath15 , see @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by : @xmath72    we notice that the hamiltonian does not depend on the @xmath29 outside the _ strip_. in order to express it in terms of the desired variables we introduce the dirichlet - neumann operators @xmath73 given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the normal derivative of the velocity potential @xmath48 , at the surface , for an outward normal @xmath76 , see more details in @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath77    we can express the hamiltonian in terms of the conjugate variables @xmath78 as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the hamiltonian in absence of shear , @xmath81 everywhere .    from ( [ kbc ] ) , @xmath82 and",
    "can be written as a canonical hamiltonian system @xmath83 or @xmath84    for the shifted variables @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 @xmath88    therefore this system of equations has the usual canonical hamiltonian form ( same as the hamiltonian form when there is no current ) after the galilean change of the coordinates , i.e. in a system travelling with velocity @xmath15 together with the flow in the strip @xmath89 .",
    "by taylor expanding the dirichlet - neumann operator we can represent it in terms of orders of @xmath31 as @xmath90 with the constant , linear and quadratic terms given as @xmath91 where the operator @xmath92 is a fourier multiplier equivalent to both the operation @xmath93 and the wavenumber @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95    the operator @xmath96 can therefore be expressed as @xmath97 and , also , the hamiltonian can be represented as @xmath98    using explicit expressions @xmath99 in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath100 is given by @xmath101    recalling ( [ hsys ] ) we calculate the linearized equations of motion as @xmath102    looking for solutions in the form @xmath103 where , as usual @xmath94 is the wave number , @xmath104 is the angular frequency and @xmath105 is the wave speed , from the compatibility of the two equations we obtain the dispersion law    @xmath106    in the case of infinite media as @xmath107 then @xmath108 and becomes @xmath109    the long - wave approximation of is the case @xmath110 which gives    @xmath111",
    "lastly , the consideration of the system as a single media system , i.e. @xmath112 in gives @xmath113 which is the well known dispersion relation for the linear approximation of gravity water waves in a single medium irrotational system @xcite .",
    "the shear flow in the layers , away from the thermocline ( the strip where the internal waves occur ) does not affect the dynamics of the internal waves .",
    "the results are complementary to the case where the vorticity is constant but with a finite jump at @xmath114 considered in @xcite . in the latter case vorticity",
    "does affect the wavespeed of the internal waves , cf . with @xcite .",
