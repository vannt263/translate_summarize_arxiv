    "the application of cellular automata , ising models and other tools of ( computational or statistical ) physics has a long tradition @xcite . of course , thinking human beings are not enthusiastic about being treated like a randomly flipping magnetic moment , since they form their opinions by complicated cognitive processes . but to see general properties of mass psychology , such simple approximations may be realistic enough . similarly , conceiving a child is a very private affair ; nevertheless from average birth rates one can predict reasonably well how many babies will be born next year in a large country . whether i smoke , drink or eat steaks , has influence on my health and on my time of death ; nevertheless , average mortality rates are published in many countries and were already studied three centuries ago by comet researcher halley .    more recently , starting perhaps with @xcite ( see @xcite for recent simulations and further literature ) , the  consensus  literature tried to find out when ( in a computer simulation ) a complete consensus from initially diverging opinions emerges .",
    "deffuant et al @xcite ( henceforth denoted as d , where earlier papers on this model are cited ) and hegselmann and krause ( hk ) @xcite had opinions on a continuous scale between @xmath1 and 1 , while the sznajd model @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) mostly used the binary choice @xmath0 for opinions .",
    "the hk model and most other `` voter '' models @xcite assume that every agent is influenced by its neighbours or by all other agents and takes , for example , the opinion of the majority of them , or of a weighted average , as its own next opinion .",
    "the sznajd model , on the other hand , assumes that every agent tries to influence its neighbours , without caring about what they think first .",
    "thus in the sznajd model the information flows outward to the neighbourhood , as in infection or rumour spreading , while in most other models the information flows inward from the neighbourhood .",
    "the d model is in between : two people who exchange opinions move closer together in their opinions .",
    "the models of hk and d assume that only people whose opinions are already close to each other can influence each other : bounded confidence .",
    "the results of these two models are similar but the d model is faster to simulate , up to 450 million agents by the present author , fig.1 .",
    "the main result is that a complete consensus is reached if the interval of opinions over which people influence each other is large enough , while for small such intervals at the end several distinct opinions survive . for the d model",
    "this can also be seen from approximate analytical treatment @xcite .",
    "the sznajd model , with only the opinions @xmath0 allowed , always leads to a complete consensus , and this remains true if @xmath2 different opinions are allowed and all opinions can influence each other . with bounded confidence in the sense that opinion @xmath3 can influence only the neighbouring opinions @xmath4 , the results are similar to those of d and hk . full consensus for @xmath5 up to three but not for larger @xmath5 .",
    "however , the sznajd model takes into account the well - known psychological and political fact that `` united we stand , divided we fall '' ; only groups of people having the same opinion , not divided groups , can influence their neighbours .",
    "in contrast to the other consensus models , the sznajd model as published thus far deals only with communication between neighbours , not between everybody . it is a `` word - of - mouth '' model .",
    "to see if a consensus emerges out of initially different opinions , all three models here start with a random initial distribution of opinions @xmath6 of @xmath7 `` people '' , where @xmath8 is a real number ( between 0 and 1 ) in the d @xcite and hk @xcite models , while it is an integer in the galam @xcite and the sznajd model @xcite . only the basic d and hk versions are reviewed here .",
    "fortran programs are listed in @xcite or given in the appendix .      in the d model @xcite , at every monte carlo step a randomly selected pair @xmath9 checks if the opinions @xmath8 and @xmath10 differ by less than a fixed parameter @xmath11 .",
    "if no , nothing happens ; if yes , both opinions move closer to each other by an amount @xmath12 . in fig.1 ,",
    "the weight @xmath13 was taken as 0.3 , and @xmath14 and 0.40 for low , intermediate and high tolerance of dissent .      also in the hk model @xcite , the opinions vary between 0 and 1 . at each monte carlo step ,",
    "one randomly selected @xmath15 takes the average opinion of all other opinions @xmath10 which differ less than @xmath11 from @xmath8 .",
    "because of this large sum , the simulation for large numbers @xmath7 of people is much slower than in the d model ; nevertheless the final results are quite similar , fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "the galam model @xcite is not really a consensus model since dissenters are ignored , not convinced .",
    "@xmath16 people are divided into @xmath17 groups of four each , each group determining by majority vote which of two possible opinions the single delegate of that group will support .",
    "four such delegates again select one representative by majority vote , four such representatives select one council member , and so on , until after @xmath18 such steps of majority hierarchies one opinion represents the whole community . in case of a 2:2 tie ,",
    "the status quo is preserved , i.e. the government wins over the opposition . even if in the initial random distribution of opinions , the opposition has a sizeable majority , at the end the minority government wins , also in the case of more realistic monte carlo simulations or modified models @xcite .",
    "some sort of consensus is also reached if all people in a room on fire run to one of two exits , leaving the other exit unused .",
    "this panic is the limiting case of a simulation @xcite using molecular dynamics techniques , where in general each person follows partly the majority direction and partly his / her own judgement .",
    "the sznajd people usually sit on lattice sites , and a pair of two neighbours @xmath9 having the same opinion @xmath19 convinces all its neighbours of this opinion @xmath8 . instead of a pair , also a single site , or a plaquette of four agreeing neighbours",
    "has been simulated @xcite to convince all neighbours .",
    "the basic sznajd model with random sequential updating always leads to a consensus , even if more than two opinions are allowed or for higher dimensions .",
    "if initially half of the opinions are @xmath20 and the other half @xmath1 , then at the end half of the samples will have @xmath21 for all @xmath15 , and the remaining half have @xmath22 everywhere .",
    "a phase transition is often observed as a function of the initial concentration @xmath23 of up spins @xmath24 : for @xmath25 all samples end up with @xmath22 , and for @xmath26 they all end up in the other fixed point @xmath27 , for large enough lattices .",
    "this phase transition at @xmath28 does not exist in one dimension @xcite or when a single site ( instead of a pair or plaquette ) on the square lattice @xcite already convinces its neighbours .",
    "pictures and cluster analysis of the domain formation process @xcite show strong similarity with ising models .",
    "the time needed to reach a complete consensus fluctuates widely and ( in the cases were a phase transition is found ) does not follow a gaussian or log - normal distribution . if convincing happens only with a certain probability , then no complete consensus is found @xcite",
    ". a hamiltonian - like description seems possible ( only ? ) in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the number of people who never changed their opinion first decays with a power of time , and then stays at a small but finite value @xcite , quite different from ising models .",
    "see @xcite for an economic application .",
    "switching from the square to the triangular or a diluted lattice does not change the qualitative results @xcite .",
    "elgazzar @xcite and schulze @xcite left the word - of - mouth limit of nearest - neighbour interactions and looked at longer ranges of interaction , using a `` small world '' network @xcite or a power - law force @xcite . if the probability to convince others decays with a power of the distance , the phase transition remains in the usual case ( when a pair is needed to convince neighbours ) , but no phase transition appears in the simpler case of a single site being able to convince @xcite . in contrast , the ising model may show a transition for power - law decay of interactions even if for nearest neighbours in one dimension no transition occurs .",
    "schulze also simulated a `` ghost site '' connected to all normal sites on the square lattice @xcite ; this ghost site convinces each normal site of the ghost opinion with a small probability . in marketing",
    ", this probability corresponds to the influence of advertising , e.g. through tv commercials .",
    "the larger the lattice is the smaller is the amount of advertising needed to convince the whole market .",
    "a different subject is `` frustration '' : what should i do if my neighbours to the left tell me to vote for @xmath20 , and those to the right tell me to vote for @xmath1 ? for the usual random sequential updating",
    "i follow first the opinion of which i am convinced first , and later i follow the one of which i am convinced later : no problem .",
    "but if simultaneous updating is used , then i am frustrated , i do not know whom to follow , and thus do not change my opinion . in this case , a consensus is difficult in small lattices and impossible in big ones @xcite .",
    "( our introduction is mostly taken from there . )",
    "these difficulties are partially reduced if i am less obedient to authority and in case of conflicting advice follow my own opinion , defined as the majority opinion in my own past voting record @xcite . the blocking effect of frustration is also removed by a small amount of noise @xcite , when people with a low probability do not follow the above rule . then after sufficiently long time a nearly complete consensus is found .",
    "talking about voting , the results of brazilian elections ( distribution of number of votes among many candidates ) were reproduced quite well if the sznajd model with many different opinions ( instead of only @xmath0 ) is put on a barabsi - albert network @xcite . if the sznajd dynamics is simultaneous to the growth of this network , complete consensus no longer is possible @xcite .",
    "on the square lattice , if only @xmath29 or 5 parties are simulated @xcite with bounded confidence , even - odd oscillations as a function of the opinion number may appear at intermediate times , with the effect that the party which was on second place halfway through the convicing process ends up with no votes , just as the fourth - ranked party , while the third - ranked party at the end still has a small number of followers . also , bounded confidence makes it difficult to reach a consensus for a large number @xmath5 of parties @xcite .",
    "returning to one dimension , behera and schweitzer showed that numerically their sznajd results can not be distinguished from a probabilistic voter model with interactions from nearest and next - nearest neighbours @xcite .",
    "in its first three years , the sznajd model @xcite , first rejected by phys . rev .",
    "letters , found followers in four continents .",
    "some of its results are ising like , others are not .",
    "more sociological numbers than only brazilian elections would be nice for comparison .",
    "thanks to f. ptsch and a. o. sousa for comments on the manuscript .",
    "in one dimension one can see without computer simulations why an initial random distribution of votes ( which is not up - down periodic everywhere like an antiferromagnet ) results in a complete consensus . after some time large domains of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are formed , with domain boundaries like @xmath32 .",
    "if the righmost plus pair in this picture is selected , it convinces the leftmost minus to become plus , and the boundary is shifted to the right . if instead the leftmost minus pair is selected , it shifts the boundary to the left .",
    "thus the boundaries undergo a random walk until they annihilate each other or are annihilated at the two sample ends .",
    "an intermediate step of this annihilation process are configurations like @xmath33 or @xmath34 . here",
    "the inner mixed region can not expand since in contrast to ising models only adjacent pairs convince ; but the inner region can shrink to annihilation when the outer pairs are selected to convince their neighbours .",
    "thus all boundaries finally vanish and we arrive at a complete consensus .",
    "these arguments apply also to more than two opinions , while simulations show this behaviour also in higher dimensions , fig.2 , in not too large lattices .",
    "simple programs for d and hk are listed below .    ....",
