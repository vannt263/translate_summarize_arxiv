    "the ly@xmath0  forest  fluctuating absorption produced by intergalactic neutral hydrogen atoms in the spectra of background quasars  is the most powerful probe of cosmic structure at redshifts @xmath11 .",
    "the physics of ly@xmath0  forest absorption is relatively well understood , thanks to numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite and related analytic methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) that accurately predict its statistical properties with minimal assumptions beyond those of the standard cosmological model . the power spectrum , correlation function , and probability distribution function ( pdf ) of ly@xmath0  forest flux have been used to constrain the underlying matter power spectrum and the thermal state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , with corresponding constraints on cosmological parameters and dark matter properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses have treated each sightline in isolation , as a collection of individual 1-dimensional tracks through the intergalactic gas distribution .",
    "the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) of sdss - iii @xcite is opening a new `` 3-dimensional '' frontier in ly@xmath0  forest cosmology by measuring absorption on a grid of sightlines ( 150,000 quasars over 10,000 square degrees ) that is large enough and dense enough to enable accurate measurements of transverse correlations across sightlines separated by tens of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . ] .",
    "boss and potential successor surveys ( e.g. , bigboss , @xcite ) present a new theoretical challenge .",
    "for instance , the recent first measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the ly@xmath0forest fluctuations in the boss data release 9 @xcite have opened new perspectives in constraining cosmological models , but the analysis and interpretation of such data require the development of efficient theoretical tools . in particular , to accurately predict the statistics of the ly@xmath0  forest at large scales for specified cosmological parameters , one must model physics on the pressure - support scale ( a.k.a . the `` jeans scale '' ) of the igm  about @xmath14 for typical values and roughly @xmath15 at overdensity of 10 ( comoving at @xmath16 , see @xcite )  while simulating volumes many hundreds of @xmath12 on a side .",
    "this paper proposes and tests a new method of meeting this challenge .",
    "most ly@xmath0  forest absorption arises in diffuse , highly photoionized gas , which is heated by photoionization and cooled adiabatically by expansion of the universe , leading to a tight correlation between temperature and density @xcite .",
    "this correlation enables the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation ( fgpa ; @xcite ) , where the ly@xmath0  optical depth is tied to the local dark matter overdensity assuming photoionization equilibrium and the @xcite formula for neutral hydrogen absorption .",
    "the fgpa can be applied to a log - normal density field created from gaussian initial conditions @xcite or to the dark matter density field of an n - body simulation , with pressure effects incorporated by smoothing the field at the gas jeans scale or by using an approximate technique @xcite to incorporate pressure into the n - body evolution .",
    "most efforts to systematically model large scale ly@xmath0  forest measurements and their dependence on cosmological parameters have used some variant of this approach , with full hydrodynamic simulations used to calibrate and test it ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "growing computer power enables more ambitious approaches , and @xcite used grids of hydrodynamic simulations to model ly@xmath0  forest statistics , but even these simulations ( @xmath17 on a side ) are tiny compared to the volume probed by boss .",
    "there are several reasons that the n - body or log - normal approaches are unsatisfactory as a tool for modeling the 3-d ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "first , even without hydrodynamics , it is not currently feasible to model gpc@xmath18 volumes while retaining good resolution on the gas jeans scale .",
    "for example , even the heroic 3000@xmath18-particle simulations analyzed by @xcite have an initial particle spacing of @xmath19 , while smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations require initial separations of @xmath20 to yield fully converged results @xcite .",
    "second , the choice of smoothing scale for the dark matter inevitably produces some ambiguity in the predictions @xcite ; ly@xmath0  forest statistics are insensitive to this choice , but not perfectly so @xcite .",
    "third , the fgpa assumes a deterministic relation between dark matter overdensity and continuum - normalized ly@xmath0  flux ( @xmath21 , hereafter simply `` flux '' ) , of the form @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is the index of the gas temperature - density relation and @xmath24 is a normalization constant that depends on several physical parameters ( see @xcite ) . in practice , there is scatter around this relation because of peculiar velocities , shock heating of the gas above the temperature - density relation , and pressure - induced differences between the gas and dark matter distributions .",
    "peculiar velocities , the largest source of scatter @xcite , can be incorporated into dark matter - based approaches , but the latter two effects require a hydrodynamic treatment . finally , even if the fgpa were a perfect approximation on some scale ( e.g. , the gas jeans scale ) , smoothing does not commute with the non - linear transformation between density and flux , so one can not simply apply it to a lower resolution dark matter simulation and recover a lower resolution version of the transmitted ly@xmath0  flux .",
    "we expect that the fgpa and log - normal methods , and even linear perturbation theory with effective bias factors calibrated on hydrodynamic simulations @xcite are adequate on sufficiently large scales , e.g. , for predicting the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) feature at @xmath25 @xcite , which is the primary target of boss .",
    "@xcite have developed an efficient semi - analytic method for generating mock data sets for the large - scale ly@xmath0  forest , tailored to reproduce the observed power spectrum and pdf , which allows tests for systematics in analysis methods and calculation of statistical errors and covariance matrices . but boss and other 3-d ly@xmath0  forest surveys will also enable precise measurements of flux correlations at scales of a few @xmath12 to a few tens of @xmath12 , where these approximations may not be accurate relative to the measurement precision .",
    "large simulation volumes are still needed in this regime , both to eliminate systematic effects of the finite box size and to ensure that statistics are limited by the available data not by the available simulation volume .",
    "deriving constraints and error bars requires making predictions as a function of cosmological and igm parameters . @xcite",
    "have proposed an elegant and accurate method for remapping non - linear dark matter distributions from one cosmology to another , so these parameter explorations can be kept inexpensive if one can carry them out with moderate resolution n - body simulations .    in this paper , we make explicit the separation - of - scale philosophy that is already implicit in these alternative methods to predict large - scale ly@xmath0  forest statistics .",
    "we concentrate on the conditional flux probability distribution ( pdf ) , the probability @xmath26 of finding flux @xmath27 in a spectral pixel at location 2 given that the flux has the value @xmath28 in a pixel with transverse ( projected ) separation @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other two - point statistics such as the flux correlation function @xmath30 can be computed by integrating over this distribution and the unconditional pdf ( see  [ sec : cpdf ] ) .",
    "it seems reasonable in principle that to predict this distribution on large scales we should only need to resolve the matter distribution on scales @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations are needed to compute the relation between the flux @xmath3 , smoothed ( 1-dimensionally ) on the scale of instrumental resolution or some deliberately chosen larger scale , and the matter density contrast @xmath4 , smoothed ( 3-dimensionally ) on a scale larger than the simulation resolution but smaller than the separations being probed . for the reasons discussed above , this relation is not deterministic but stochastic , described by a conditional probability distribution @xmath2 .",
    "our conjecture is that one can predict @xmath32 for a given cosmological and igm model by using a moderate resolution n - body simulation to compute @xmath33 and convolving this with the local conditional distribution computed from high - resolution hydro simulations , @xmath2 evaluated for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "physically , we are assuming that the fluxes at positions 1 and 2 are correlated because the matter densities at these positions are correlated , and that the _ deviation _",
    "@xmath36 from the conditional mean is uncorrelated with the _ deviation _ @xmath37 .",
    "the assumption of uncorrelated deviations will certainly fail for closely neighboring pixels , whose fluxes will lie above or below the conditional mean for the same reason , but we expect it to become accurate quickly at larger separations .",
    "we test this conjecture explicitly using a large , adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulation of a @xmath1 comoving volume , realized with @xmath8 dark matter particles and a @xmath8 top - level hydro grid , evolved with the amr hydro code ramses @xcite .",
    "we use this simulation to calibrate the @xmath2 relation for several choices of dark matter and ly@xmath0  smoothing scales .",
    "we then compare the ly@xmath0  forest statistics computed from the gas distribution of the simulation to those computed from the dark matter distribution by the procedure described above , which we refer to as lymas for ly@xmath0  mass association scheme .",
    "we also compare results to the deterministic fgpa approach applied on the same smoothing scales , finding that lymas  is significantly more accurate at small separations . for compactness , we will sometimes abbreviate ly@xmath0  forest to lyaf  in the remainder of the paper .    in the next section",
    "we describe the hydro simulation and our methods for creating lyaf  spectra and for extracting skewers of the smoothed dark matter density field .",
    "section  [ sec : cpdf ] presents lymas  in its simplest form , which is designed to predict flux statistics across sightlines but does not produce realistic artificial spectra , because it ignores correlated deviations of @xmath38 along an individual line of sight . in  [",
    "sec : pseudospectra ] we describe an extended scheme that produces artificial spectra with a 1-d flux power spectrum and 1-point pdf that ( almost ) exactly match those of the full spectra from the hydro simulation while retaining the accurate performance of lymas  for cross - sightline statistics . in ",
    "[ sec : appli ] we describe the application of lymas  to n - body simulations of a @xmath9 and @xmath10 comoving volume , illustrating the impact of finite box size on flux correlation statistics .",
    "we summarize our results and look towards future applications in  [ sec : discussion ] . finally ,",
    "in the website dedicated to lymas , we describe several sets of electronic tables being made available with this paper , presenting the conditional flux pdfs computed from the marenostrum hydro simulation and the mock spectra extracted from the large n - body simulations .",
    "in this section , we introduce the `` horizon - marenostrum '' simulation , a high resolution cosmological n - body and hydrodynamics simulation we have analyzed to generate our calibrations .",
    "we will then describe our procedures to extract from this simulation the lyaf spectra as well as dm density fields .",
    "the horizon - marenostrum simulation ( which we hereafter refer to simply as marenostrum ) was run for a @xmath39cdm universe using wmap1 parameters @xcite , namely @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 km / s / mpc , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the simulation was performed in a periodic box of side @xmath46 mpc with @xmath8 dark matter particles ( e.g. with mass resolution of @xmath47 ) and an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) technique @xcite was used to keep the spatial resolution fixed at @xmath48 kpc in physical units .",
    "the evolution of the thermodynamic properties of the gas depends on a wide range of physical processes .",
    "in particular , marenostrum incorporates metal - dependent cooling and photoionization heating from a uv background computed via the prescriptions of @xcite , starting at a reionization redshift @xmath49 .",
    "a model of supernova feedback and metal enrichment has also been incorporated using the implementation described by @xcite .",
    "the high - redshift ly@xmath0  forest arises mainly in gas with overdensity @xmath50 , whose thermal evolution is governed primarily by photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling from the expansion of the universe . for reference ,",
    "figure  [ fig : mn0 ] shows the evolution of the mean temperature of the igm at the mean density ( from @xmath51 to @xmath5 ) , and figure  [ fig : mn ] shows the mass - weighted temperature - density diagram of the marenostrum simulation at our analysis redshift @xmath52 . at densities",
    "@xmath53 one sees the usual sharp locus of photoionized gas , with a small fraction of gas shock heated above this relation . at higher densities one sees shock - heated gas in halos and",
    "the locus of radiatively cooled and star - forming gas in galaxies . for further details of the mn simulation",
    ", we refer the readers to previous papers that have used it for other analyses @xcite .",
    "we compute ly@xmath0 absorption spectra along about one million lines of sight cast through the @xmath54 output of the marenostrum simulation . at this redshift ,",
    "the simulated volume allows us to probe ly@xmath0 absorption lines over a range of @xmath55 around the observed wavelength @xmath56 . for a given sight - line ,",
    "the opacity at observer - frame frequency @xmath57 is @xmath58 , where the sum extends over all ( leaf ) cells traversed by the ray , @xmath59 is the numerical density of neutral h atoms in each cell , @xmath60 is the cross section of hydrogen to ly@xmath0 photons , and @xmath61 is the physical cell size . we compute @xmath60 as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the ly@xmath0 oscillator strength , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the electron s charge and mass , @xmath66 is the doppler frequency width due to thermal motions of atoms at temperature @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the ratio of the natural line width ( @xmath69 ) to the doppler frequency width .",
    "the cross section is a function of frequency in the rest - frame of the absorbing gas cell @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is the cell s line - of - sight velocity ) , which we use to define the dimensionless frequency offset @xmath72 .",
    "finally , the hjerting function @xmath73 is : @xmath74    in practice , for each sight - line , we compute the opacity due to all cells on a high - resolution grid of observer - frame wavelength ( with @xmath75 ) .",
    "we then compute a high - resolution normalized flux @xmath76 , which we integrate down to the targeted 1024 @xmath77-bins . at the observed frame wavelength @xmath78 , the resolution of the boss spectrographs",
    "@xcite is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the fwhm of the line - spread function , implying @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding gaussian dispersion is @xmath82 , which translates to a comoving distance of @xmath83 . to mimic the effects of boss spectral resolution , therefore",
    ", we convolve our extracted lyaf  spectra with a 1-d gaussian of dispersion @xmath84 .",
    "note also that when generating our grid of flux , the marenostrum simulation leads to a mean flux decrement with a slightly too high value .",
    "following standard practice in ly@xmath0  forest modeling , we match the observed mean decrement at @xmath85 @xcite by changing the uv background intensity in post - processing , increasing its intensity by a factor of about 1.3 .",
    "the results should be virtually identical to those of a simulation run with this higher intensity background during evolution , since at igm densities the photoionization heating rate is insensitive to the uv background intensity @xcite .      to extract dark matter skewers ,",
    "we follow a 3-step process :    * adaptive interpolation of the dm particle distribution on a high resolution grid ( here a @xmath8 grid for the horizon - marenostrum simulation and a @xmath86 grid for the gadget simulations of section  [ sec : appli ] ) .",
    "note that this interpolation is performed after projection into redshift space if needed .",
    "redshift space projection is performed along the @xmath87 coordinate , so that we work in the distant observer limit . *",
    "smoothing with a gaussian window in fourier space , using the fact that even when working in redshift space , periodicity of the box is preserved because we use the distant observer limit . *",
    "extraction of the skewers from a grid of lines of sight aligned along the @xmath87 axis and positioned at random otherwise .",
    "the adaptive interpolation method we use is described by @xcite , so we give here only a quick sketch of it .",
    "it is similar to sph interpolation except that it is not a direct projection of the particles as an ensemble of round clouds on the grid .",
    "indeed , the sph interpolation method , if used as is , can behave poorly in underdense regions , where it can leave totally empty grid sites . to avoid this defect ,",
    "each grid site is considered as a virtual particle and the @xmath88 closest particles to it are found ( here @xmath89 ) .",
    "then we perform a calculation of the density at the center of the cell using a weight for each particle @xmath90 that is roughly proportional to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the distance of the particle to the center of the cell and where @xmath93 is a standard sph kernel function @xcite .",
    "we use the term `` roughly '' because the actual interpolation scheme is more complex than that : ( i ) special treatment is performed when the number of particles in the cell , @xmath94 , exceeds @xmath88 : in this case , we perform the interpolation over the @xmath94 particles instead of @xmath88 : this is to minimize the deviation from total mass conservation discussed below ; ( ii ) to make sure that the total contribution of each particle equals its mass @xmath95 , a renormalization of its local contribution to each cell is performed _ a posteriori _",
    "( i.e. , after calculating its contribution to each individual cell ) . our scheme does not guarantee that all the particles contribute : there might be some cases where a particle could not contribute to any grid site , which means that the total mass is not conserved exactly .",
    "this effect is however small , usually of the order of @xmath96 percent ( it is fixed by an overall renormalization of the grid density ) .",
    "the adaptive interpolation scheme is relatively expensive , but it preserves high - resolution information in overdense regions of the dark matter field .",
    "we have not tested lymas  with simpler density assignment methods such as cloud - in - cell , so we caution that our favorable findings below might not apply in this case .",
    "our approach to predicting lyaf  flux statistics is based on the conditional distribution of flux given density .",
    "figure  [ fig : uncond_pdf ] plots the _ unconditional _ flux pdf of the lyaf spectra extracted from the hydro simulation , in real space and in redshift space , where the spectra have been smoothed to boss resolution . figure  [ fig : scatter_plots ] plots contours of the joint distribution of optical depth @xmath97 and overdensity @xmath98 , where the subscript @xmath99 emphasizes that the flux is smoothed ( in one dimension ) to the boss spectral resolution and the density contrast is smoothed with a 3-d gaussian of radius @xmath6 ( top panels ) or @xmath100 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the top left panel shows a tight correlation between the real space smoothed overdensity and the `` real space '' lyaf  flux , i.e. , the flux computed with all gas peculiar velocities ( but not thermal broadening ) set to zero .",
    "this tight correlation , first noted by @xcite , provided the initial motivation for the fgpa .",
    "croft et al .",
    "noted that the scatter in the correlation goes up when one includes peculiar velocities of the gas , which shift the line of sight location of absorption features and raise or lower optical depths through convergence or divergence in velocity space .",
    "we see this effect in the top middle panel of figure  [ fig : scatter_plots ] .",
    "however , in the right panels we show the correlation when the dark matter distribution is _ also _ computed in redshift space : the scatter decreases , producing a correlation that is essentially just as tight as the one obtained in real space .",
    "the same trends hold for a @xmath100 smoothing length ( lower panels ) , but in this case the range of densities is compressed , and the correlation is steeper . as a result , the scatter in optical depth has larger impact relative to the trend with density . for our calculations below , we have experimented with a range of smoothing lengths , and we find that the best results ( i.e. , the most accurate predictions for flux statistics ) are obtained with a smoothing length in the range @xmath101 .",
    "this is comparable to the jeans scale for @xmath102 @xcite and somewhat smaller than the boss spectra resolution scale of @xmath103 .",
    "we have not tested whether smaller smoothing lengths would give better results for higher resolution spectra .",
    "however , we also carry out most of our tests for @xmath100 smoothing , as this still works quite well , and it can be applied to n - body simulations with lower resolution .",
    "the fgpa converts dm density to optical depth using a physical model motivated by photoionization equilibrium assuming that all gas contributing to the lyaf  lies on a temperature - density relation @xmath104 , leading to @xmath105 this relation makes sense for modeling high - resolution spectra , but it does not necessarily apply at low resolution because of the non - linear relation between flux and optical depth , and even in the high - resolution case it omits some physical effects . alternatively , one can derive an `` optimal '' deterministic relation between smoothed density and smoothed flux that is calibrated on hydro simulations , a strategy advocated by @xcite . a straightforward choice for an `` optimal '' mapping is to find the unique monotonic relation between the smoothed matter density and the smoothed flux such that the spectra generated from the dark matter have the same unconditional 1-point flux pdf as the spectra from the hydro simulation .",
    "we do so by matching the corresponding cumulative distributions to a pixel with dm contrast @xmath4 we assign a flux @xmath3 such that @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the 1-point pdfs of flux and dm density measured from the simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : determ_rel ] illustrates this procedure graphically and shows the resulting mapping , which is slightly different in real space and redshift space because the pdfs are different in the two cases ( see fig .  [ fig : uncond_pdf ] ) .",
    "the mapping is also different if we consider the @xmath100 dm smoothing rather than the @xmath109 smoothing .",
    "well after reionization , the interplay between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling produces a temperature - density relation @xmath110 in the diffuse photo - ionized medium that dominates the lyaf  @xcite , and in this case ( which applies in our simulation ) the fgpa predicts @xmath111 . our deterministic relations for @xmath109 smoothing have this logarithmic slope at low density , but the relation flattens somewhat at higher density , with lower optical depth than the @xmath112 extrapolation predicts",
    ". this flattening may be partly a consequence of working at boss resolution rather than high resolution .",
    "we will use the deterministic mappings plotted here as a foil for evaluating the success of the lymas  probabilistic scheme .",
    "the scatter in figure  [ fig : scatter_plots ] shows that the relation between dm density and flux is not , in fact , deterministic .",
    "figure  [ fig : prob_cond_dm ] plots the conditional probability distributions @xmath2 for dark matter density contrasts @xmath113 , 0 , 1 , and 4 ; each curve represents a vertical cut through the corresponding panel of figure  [ fig : scatter_plots ] . beginning with the top row , for dm smoothing length @xmath114 , we see that these conditional distributions are quite broad , though they always show the expected trend of lower average flux for higher dm density .",
    "the middle panel , based on redshift - space spectra but real - space dm densities , has broader distributions as expected .",
    "however , when we use redshift - space dm densities ( right panel ) , the distributions are if anything sharper and more differentiated than those obtained for real - space spectra and real - space dm densities ( left panel ) .",
    "the bottom row , for dm smoothing @xmath115 , shows similar trends , but the curves are less differentiated than those for @xmath114 .",
    "the distributions for @xmath113 , 0 , and 1 have maxima at nearly the same flux level ( @xmath116 in the right panel ) , and in redshift - space the @xmath117 curve is nearly flat over a wide range of flux , so its maximum is poorly defined .",
    "this difference is not surprising , since the @xmath115 smoothing scale is larger than the boss spectral resolution scale , and smoothing the dm density to this scale therefore loses information that is relevant to predicting the boss - resolution flux .",
    "we will nonetheless find that the lymas  scheme with @xmath100 dm smoothing outperforms the deterministic scheme with @xmath109 smoothing .    as described already in the introduction , the philosophy of lymasis to assume that the fluxes along separate lines of sight can be drawn independently from the conditional probability distributions @xmath2",
    ", with the flux correlations across lines of sight arising from correlations in the underlying dm density field ( coherent fluctuations in the uv background or the igm equation - of - state could also produce large scale flux correlations ; these effects can be incorporated into lymas  simulations , but we have not done so here ) . to compute 2-point flux statistics via lymas , we create artificial spectra along each of the dm skewers extracted from the simulation , assigning to each pixel a flux that is randomly drawn from the conditional distribution @xmath2 that we have computed from the hydro simulation and illustrated in figure  [ fig : prob_cond_dm ] .",
    "the creation of artificial spectra is not strictly necessary for computing these flux statistics ; it is effectively a convenient monte carlo method of doing the relevant integrals over the probability distributions . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : pseudospectra ] below , the artificial spectra created in this simple manner are unrealistic because they ignore additional correlations ( beyond those from dm alone ) that arise in neighboring pixels along a single line of sight . in  [ sec : pseudospectra ] we present a method for creating realistic artificial spectra that have the correct degree of coherence along individual lines of sight , but this more complex method is not needed for predicting flux statistics in the idealized case , with no contribution from observational effects such as noise and continuum fitting errors .",

    "the solid black curve shows the unconditional 1-point pdf . as expected , imposing the condition @xmath122 , i.e. , strong absorption along the neighboring line of sight , increases the probability of @xmath28 being low .",
    "the peak of the conditional distribution is depressed in amplitude , but it is only slightly shifted in location relative to the unconditional pdf .",
    "interestingly , the impact of the @xmath125 condition is stronger in redshift space than in real space , presumably reflecting the additional effects of coherence in the velocity field . for @xmath126 , which still represents fairly strong absorption ( about 15th - percentile in the cumulative distribution ) ,",
    "we see similar effects but reduced in magnitude .    even for this fairly small transverse separation , the lymas  scheme with @xmath114",
    "reproduces the results from the true hydro spectra almost perfectly , with the most noticeable error being a small deviation in the height of the peak .",
    "the deterministic scheme is considerably less accurate , especially in redshift space and for the lower @xmath125 .",
    "remarkably , despite the broader conditional distributions seen in figure  [ fig : prob_cond_dm ] , lymas  with @xmath115 is nearly as accurate as with @xmath114 when computing the conditional flux pdf at these separations , and it is again much more accurate than the deterministic relation .",
    "the blue - dashed curve in all panels shows results for the `` coherent '' pseudo - spectrum method described in ",

    "two of the panels in the middle column repeat the two right - hand panels of figure  [ fig : prob_cond_r ] .",
    "we can see a number of trends , all in qualitative agreement with expectations .",
    "the impact of the conditioning flux is strongest when the transverse separation is small , though it is still noticeable at @xmath130 . as the conditioning flux @xmath125",
    "is increased , the conditional pdf of @xmath28 shifts towards higher flux values . for @xmath131 and @xmath130",
    ", the conditional pdf nearly matches the unconditional pdf .",

    "conditional distributions like those in figure  [ fig : prob_cond_s ] provide a comprehensive description of the two - point correlations in the lyaf  flux field .",

    "however , a proper comparison to observations would have to account for the effects of noise on the conditioning flux @xmath125 , which do _ not _ cancel by averaging ; we ignore these effects here .",
    "note that the vertical scales are different in each panel .",

    "we see from figure  [ fig : spectrum1 ] that when one pixel has a high value of @xmath161 , and thus a high flux relative the conditional mean expected given the local dm density , then its neighboring pixels also have high values of @xmath161 .",
    "the coherence of the `` percentile field '' dies away gradually with separation , but independent draws from @xmath2 lose this coherence entirely .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum1 ] also suggests a strategy for creating more realistic pseudo - spectra : for each skewer @xmath162 through the smoothed dm density field ( where @xmath163 represents redshift - space position along the line of sight ) , first generate a percentile spectrum @xmath164 with the correct statistical properties , then draw the flux in each pixel from the conditional distribution @xmath165 at the location in this distribution implied by @xmath164 .",

    "this transformation slightly alters the 1-d power spectrum , and in principle one could iterate back and forth between these two steps . in practice , we find that a single iteration already produces excellent agreement with the target 1-d power spectrum up to quite high @xmath171 , as shown by the dotted curve in figure  [ fig:1dpk ] .",

    "lymas  shifts the problem of simulating gpc@xmath18 volumes of the ly@xmath0  forest from the realm of computationally impossible to computationally challenging .",
    "an n - body simulation of a @xmath197 cube with high enough resolution to produce @xmath114 dark matter skewers requires @xmath227 particles , and even the creation of the dark matter field from the n - body particle distribution is a cpu- and memory - intensive task .",
    "one also requires a calibrating hydrodynamic simulation for each cosmological model of interest , of large enough volume to yield accurate @xmath2 . as a first step ,",
    "we have created catalogs of artificial spectra at boss resolution for the marenostrum cosmology at @xmath228 , from a @xmath9 box with @xmath6 and a @xmath197 box with @xmath115 . in future work",
    ", we will investigate methods for incorporating the redshift evolution of the forest over the range probed by an individual quasar spectrum and move towards a full realization ( from multiple simulations ) of the boss quasar sample .    alongside these technical challenges , the most interesting direction for future study with lymas",
    "is to explore the sensitivity of medium and large scale structure in the 3-d ly@xmath0  forest to the underlying cosmological and igm parameters . indeed , if the thermal history of the hydro simulation or the cosmological parameters change , the pdf of the flux and then the probabilities @xmath2 would also change . at present",
    ", we do nt know if we still need to derive new calibration tables for each set of specific cosmological parameters ( or set of thermal history models ) or whether a simple rescaling at some steps from the present study would be acceptable .",
    "nevertheless , these investigations can be started by manipulating the marenostrum simulation to compute conditional flux pdfs for different igm equations of state ( by artificially changing gas temperatures ) or matter fluctuation amplitudes ( by relabeling output redshifts ) , then applying these conditional pdfs to different n - body outputs .",
    "these rescaling calculations should be spot - checked against fully self - consistent sets of simulations , but we expect they will provide good guidance to the sensitivity of flux statistics to cosmology and degeneracies with the igm .",
    "there are obvious analogies between the lymas  approach to modeling the ly@xmath0  forest and methods for creating galaxy redshift catalogs by populating the dark matter halos of n - body simulations in accord with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , with the advantage that predicting the ly@xmath0  forest from first principles is more straightforward than modeling galaxy formation .",
    "however , the effects of ionizing background fluctuations @xcite , inhomogeneous reionization @xcite , and metal - line contamination remain important potential systematics that require further scrutiny .    the potential payoff from exploiting sub - bao scales in the 3-d ly@xmath0",
    "forest is large .",
    "one long - recognized opportunity is to apply the alcock - paczynski ( @xcite ) test to the ly@xmath0  forest to constrain the product @xmath229 at high redshift @xcite ; this requires accurate predictions of the intrinsic anisotropy in ly@xmath0  forest clustering .",
    "a more model - dependent variant of this idea is to use the amplitude of correlations as a function of transverse separation to constrain @xmath230 directly .",
    "the slope and curvature of the matter power spectrum are diagnostics for neutrino masses or curvature in the inflationary fluctuation spectrum , and the ly@xmath0  forest can probe the power spectrum shape on scales that are degraded by non - linear evolution at low redshift .",
    "most enticing but perhaps most challenging is the prospect of precisely constraining the amplitude of matter clustering at @xmath231 , so that @xmath39cdm predictions for the growth of structure can be tested from the cmb epoch through the ly@xmath0  forest epoch down to the lower redshifts probed by large weak lensing and galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "these tests could reveal the signatures of complex dark energy models or devations from general relativity on cosmological scales . with the massively multi - plexed spectroscopic surveys underway and planned for the future , the 3-d ly@xmath0  forest is emerging as a major new route to tracing the growth of structure in the universe .",
    "lymas  is an important step towards matching theoretical predictions to this observational opportunity .",
