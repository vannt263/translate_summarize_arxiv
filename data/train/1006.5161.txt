    "research interest in the origins of the long - range bidirectional movement of particles ( organelles , vesicles , nutrients ) driven by molecular motors is motivated by fundamental questions concerning the nature of interactions between motors and their cargos as transport processes take place .",
    "a current explanation for the phenomenon relies on the idea that motors of different polarities act coordinately on the same particle at different times . if , however , they act in parallel , the bidirectional movement would reflect dominance of one or another kind of motor achieved by a _ tug - of - war _ mechanism @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . an important question that remains in this context concerns the mechanisms that would promote such coordination @xcite .",
    "alternatives to the coordination or _ tug - of - war _ models in the literature arise from the possibility of attributing the phenomenon to a dynamic role of the microtubules @xcite or to a mechanical coupling between different motors @xcite .",
    "a general difficulty encountered within any of these views is related to the presence of other particles ( including other motors ) on the microtubule at a given time that are not directly involved with the transfer process .",
    "these other particles are expected to impose restrictions on motility and performance of the motors that are directly interacting with cargo at that time @xcite .",
    "contrarily to these expectations , however , data from observations of beads driven by kinesins in steady - state conditions indicate that the number of long length runs of such beads increases significantly as the density of motors at the microtubule increases , although their velocities remain essentially unaltered within a wide range of motor concentrations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , the reality of traffic jam in crowded microtubules still challenges the current view of long - range cargo transport that presupposes an effective and controllable movement  of the motor(s ) arranged into a motor - cargo complex .",
    "this , of course , requires a certain degree of stability of motor - cargo interactions and motor processivity .",
    "our intention here is to discuss these problems from a different perspective by bringing into this scenario the model introduced in @xcite to examine cargo transport as a _ hopping _ process .",
    "according to that , motors and cargos would not assemble into complexes to put transport into effect . on the contrary , each motor would function as an active overpass for cargo to step over to a neighboring motor .  in this case , the long - range movement of cargo is envisaged as a sequence of these elementary ( short - range ) steps either forwards or backwards . in @xcite we examined the conditions under which this may happen , accounting for the fact that motor motility is affected by the interactions with other motors and with cargos on the microtubule .",
    "there , we considered the presence of a collection of interacting motors , all of them presenting the same polarity ( kinesins may be thought of as prototypes ) and a single cargo . here , we examine whether it is possible to explain in a similar context the origin of the observed bidirectional movement displayed by cargos .",
    "the particular mechanism we propose to substantiate the hopping differs from that suggested in @xcite .",
    "it keeps , however , the same general ideas of the original .",
    "as it will be explained below , we view the hopping of cargo between motors as an effect of thermal fluctuations undergone by motor tails .",
    "the flexibility of the tails may promote contact and , eventually , exchange of cargo between neighboring motors .    as in @xcite ,",
    "the model dynamics is mapped into an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite whose stationary properties are resolved explicitly in the limit of very large systems .",
    "other asep models have already been considered in the literature to study the conditions for motor jamming in the absence of cargo @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our model is conceived to account explicitly for changes in the dynamics of the motors that at a certain instant of time are interacting with cargos .",
    "the model is reviewed here in order to include a second cargo in the system , still keeping the presence of motors of a single polarity .",
    "we believe that this approaches more realistic situations in which the simultaneous presence of many cargos and motors on the same microtubule must be the prevailing situation @xcite .",
    "we show that under these conditions , a cargo may be able to execute long - range bidirectional movement as it moves over clusters of motors assembled either at its back end or at the back end of the cargo in front .",
    "one may recognize in this a possibility for explaining the origins of self - regulation in intracellular transport since it has been suggested in the last few years that signaling pathways involved in intracellular traffic regulation can be  performed simply by the presence of cargos at the microtubule @xcite .",
    "we then speculate that the passage of cargos on microtubules does not get blocked by motor jamming . on the contrary ,",
    "jamming operates as an allied process to promote long runs of cargos across motor clusters . in this case , the density of motors on the microtubule can be identified as an element of control in intracellular transport since it directly affects the conditions for jamming .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the model developed here does not rule out other possibilities , such as the _ tug - of - war _ or competition models .",
    "what we suggest is that the presence of motors of different polarities may not be essential to explain the origin of the bidirectional movement .",
    "the hopping mechanism is presented in sec.2 .",
    "the kinetic properties of the extended version are developed in sec.3 , considering the presence of two cargos .",
    "in sec.4 we present our results .",
    "additional remarks and conclusions are in sec.5 .",
    "the stochastic model in @xcite formulated in a lattice describes the dynamics of motors and cargos accounting for ( i ) steric interactions among different particles moving on the same microtubule ; ( ii ) the presence of motors of a single polarity ; ( iii ) the fact that cargos do not move if not driven by motors .",
    "the crucial point is in item ( iii ) because it requires a specific model for motor - cargo dynamics as transportation takes place .",
    "we offer here a slightly different view from that in @xcite keeping however the reliance on the ability of motors to transfer cargo .",
    "one way by which this may be achieved is sketched in _ figure ( 1)_. the stepping of cargo would be accomplished as it is released from a motor to which it is attached at a certain instant of time and then get attached to another ( neighboring ) motor either at the left or at the right ",
    "see _ figure ( 1a)_. this process , like the one discussed in @xcite , relies strongly on the flexibility of the motor 's tail .",
    "the idea was inspired by experimental results suggesting a dynamic role of the kinesin 's coiled - coil segment in the process @xcite , @xcite and also by data indicating that under load , kinesin motors display an oscillatory movement @xcite @xcite . here , we think of these oscillations as signaling fluctuations in the position of motor 's tail , not necessarily being correlated with displacement of its center of mass .",
    "if this is the case , such oscillations would promote contact between neighboring motors favoring cargo exchange .",
    "accordingly , long - range displacements of cargo would reflect a hopping process extended over many neighboring motors which may be accomplished if these motors get jammed into clusters for sufficient long periods of time.notice that the whole mechanism does not require special stability of cargo - motor binding . on the contrary , the transfer of cargo by a motor would be ease by a loose attachment between them .    the model in @xcite",
    "was resolved explicitly considering the presence of a single cargo in the system .",
    "the averages for the quantities of interest were determined in steady - state conditions .",
    "we showed there that the long - range displacements of the cargo would occur predominantly in the backwards direction , i.e. in opposition to the direction of the movement of the considered motors .",
    "we shall show here that the same dynamics may lead cargo to display bidirectional movement if the system contains at least one more cargo interfering with the movement of the motors .    to examine the properties of the system containing two cargos and an arbitrary number of motors",
    ", we map it into the same asep as in goldman1 whose dynamics can also reproduce the scheme in _ figure(1)_.      we consider a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath0 sites , representing the microtubule with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this system contains @xmath1 motors and a number @xmath2 of other particles - the cargos - that interact with motors in order to move .",
    "each site can be occupied by a motor or by a motor attached to a cargo _ ( see fig.1(a ) ) _ , otherwise it is empty .",
    "the total number of sites that remain unoccupied is @xmath3 . here",
    ", we analyze the long - time behavior of this system for @xmath4 and determine the average cargo velocity as a function of the parameters .",
    "the results indicate conditions for cargos to perform a type of long - range movement that share the characteristics of the observed bidirectional movement .    the map of the dynamics shown in _",
    "figure.1 _ into the considered asep is carried out as follows .",
    "_ _  _ _ first , each site is identified by its position @xmath5 at the lattice .",
    "then , to each of these sites is associated a variable @xmath6 that assumes integer values @xmath7 or @xmath8 such that @xmath9 if the site @xmath10 is empty , @xmath11 if it is occupied by a motor ; or @xmath12 if it is occupied by a motor attached to a cargo . with these",
    ", a configuration @xmath13 of the lattice is specified by the set @xmath14 @xmath15 the dynamics of the asep that reproduces the elementary steps in _",
    "fig.1 _ can now be defined . for this , consider that at each time interval @xmath16 a pair of consecutive sites , say @xmath10 and @xmath17 are selected at random .",
    "the occupancy of these two sites is then switched according to the following rules @xmath18where the pair @xmath19 is represented by the values of the corresponding site variables @xmath20the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the assigned probabilities per unit time ( rates ) for occurrence of the processes indicated .",
    "process @xmath23 describes the possibility for a motor ( kinesin ) that carries no cargo to step forward to a neighboring empty site _ ( figure 1b)_. processes @xmath24 and @xmath25 account for the switching of the cargo between two neighboring motors .",
    "this accounts either for backward @xmath24 or for forward steps",
    "notice that the dynamics conserves the number of particles of type-1 as well as those of type-2 .    in order to investigate the long - time dynamics of a cargo resulting from these elementary steps we use the _ matrix _ _ ansatz _ introduced by derrida @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea is to represent the probability @xmath26 of a configuration @xmath13 of the system with @xmath1 sites and @xmath0 particles of type-1 as a trace over a product of @xmath1 non - commuting matrices , each specifying the corresponding site occupancy:@xmath27where @xmath28is the normalization .",

    "it is necessary at first to find the _ algebra _ that must be satisfied by these matrices such that the probabilities defined in ( [ prob do estado ] ) satisfy the stationary conditions @xcite ,    @xmath38    where the sum extends over all configurations of @xmath0 motors distributed over @xmath39 lattice sites .",
    "observe that the nonzero terms on the lhs of the above equation are those for which configurations @xmath13 and @xmath40 differ from each other at most by the positions of a pair of consecutive sites , which can be reversed by any of the elementary processes defined by the dynamics in ( [ dinamica ] ) . in this case , each factor @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) must be replaced by the rate @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath22 for the corresponding elementary process that brings @xmath13 back from @xmath40 ( or @xmath40 from @xmath13 ) .",
    "the algebra corresponding to the asep defined by the dynamics ( [ dinamica ] ) has been presented in ( @xcite ) for @xmath45    @xmath46    with @xmath47here , we shall use this same algebra to evaluate the traces over products of matrices @xmath48 @xmath34 and @xmath36 that appear in calculating averages over the quantities that characterize the movement of a cargo . before proceeding , however , a few remarks are in order .",
    "the model with two cargos is not ergodic .",
    "the dynamics preserves the number of empty spaces in each of the two partitions defined by the initial positions of the two cargos in the system with periodic boundary conditions .  in this case , all configurations @xmath13 and @xmath49 that satisfy equation ( [ mestra ] ) must share the number of empty spaces in each of the partitions .",
    "moreover , configurations in which the empty spaces are all concentrated in one of the two partitions must be excluded , for these do not satisfy ( [ mestra ] ) with the algebra ( [ algebra ] ) .",

    "we notice in these results that for varying @xmath152 and for @xmath155 slightly above @xmath167 the average velocity of the cargo changes sign .",
    "this means that at steady state , which may be achieved at sufficiently short times after an eventual change in motor density at the microtubule , cargos may adjust and change their direction of propagation moving across motor clusters .",
    "the mechanism for cargo transfer envisaged here is equivalent to a hopping process in which the associated rates depend on site occupation .",
    "because motors move and their movement is affected by the presence of the cargos and all other motors on the microtubule , the long - time dynamics of  the system must be examined globally .",
    "our results indicate that the existence of mutual interactions and the fact that many cargos are allowed to coexist at the microtubule are determinant for reproducing in this context the characteristics of the bidirectional movement . we show that within a certain range of motor density a cargo in this system executes long - range displacements in both directions .",
    "we may argue then that long - range cargo transfer is facilitated by traffic and specifically , by the assembly of motors into clusters , which characterizes traffic jam .",
    "the presence of the other cargos in the system is essential for this to occur as they function as additional obstacles that interfere in the motor density profile .",
    "each cargo induces aggregation of motors at its back end . in turn , this provides the conditions for cargo to execute long - range displacements either backwards , over the aggregate assembled at its back end , as well as forwards , over the aggregate assembled at the back end of the cargo in front .",
    "as it was originally formulated the model does not account for the possibility that a motor with one or more attached cargos may move as well .",
    "in fact , this is the only mechanism that is usually employed to describe cargo transport and it is the basis for _ coordination _ or _ tug - of - war _ models .",
    "also ,  for simplicity we have considered interactions of a cargo with a single motor at a time . should  a set of motors be allowed to interact with the cargo to participate in the transfer process then the map into the asep would need to be modified accordingly .",
    "we are currently working on these possibilities by including into the dynamics ( [ dinamica ] ) a process of the kind @xmath168 that recovers ergodicity of the model @xcite    we should emphasize that the occurrence of the long - range bidirectional movement as a consequence of the hopping processes devised here may happen by the action of motors of just one kind possessing a well defined polarity .",
    "changes in motor density and related traffic profile suffice as a mechanism to control cargo direction and the size of the runs determined essentially by the extent of motor clusters at jamming conditions .",
    "this offers a rather straightforward explanation for the data mentioned above suggesting that the number of long run - lengths performed by the observed beads increases significantly as the density of motors at the microtubule increases beeg .",
    "in addition , the results presented here indicate that , for sufficiently high values of the motor density for which @xmath169 at the point where the model displays a phase transition , cargos would perform a uniform movement ( on average ) since their velocities become independent of @xmath170 such behavior has also been observed in the same set of experiments .",
    "as noticed by ma and chisholm @xcite , `` little is known regarding motor traffic and how it correlates with the movement of cargo '' . here ,",
    "we offer a possibility based on the idea that the transport does not require the action of an external agent to coordinate the process , or a _ tug - of - war _ mechanism or even the existence of a mechanical coupling between two kinds of motors as proposed more recently @xcite .",
    "instead , it suggests that such coordination can be achieved by collective effects on the course of the dynamics as the system `` self - organizes '' so that it presents characteristics that reflect an internal ( and global ) order that does not have its origin in the characteristics of the external medium .",
    "it is then possible that the necessary transport in cells is accomplished just by adjusting the density of motors at the microtubule .",
    "accordingly , the presence of processive motors of different polarities that are normally required to explain the movement of a putative motor - cargo complex would not be necessary .",
    "transportation here is based on a mechanism that requires formation of clusters of motors , not necessarily on their ability to travel along long distances .",

    "<S> most models designed to study the bidirectional movement of cargos as they are driven by molecular motors rely on the idea that motors of different polarities can be coordinated by external agents if arranged into a motor - cargo complex to perform the necessary work @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the movement of a cargo is conceived here as a _ hopping process _ resulting from the transference of cargo between neighboring motors . in the light of this </S>",

    "<S> the global properties of the model in the long - time regime are obtained by mapping the dynamics of the collection of interacting motors and cargos into an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) which can be resolved using the matrix _ ansatz _ introduced by derrida @xcite .    </S>",
