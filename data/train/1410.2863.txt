    "cavity optomechanics studies quantum effects induced by light - matter interaction between cavity and mechanical modes  @xcite .",

    ", the optomechanical systems can demonstrate strong nonlinearity .",
    "it is promising to reach this regime in several experimental systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent theoretical works have shown that ultrastrong coupling could be achieved by various quantum engineering schemes  @xcite .    the cavity and the mechanical modes in an optomechanical system are subject to environmental noise , which causes decoherence and plays a crucial role in studying the nonlinear optical effects .",
    "the system - bath couplings can be treated with a master equation approach .",
    "very often , a standard master equation ( sme ) is used to describe the damping and thermal excitations .",

    "such treatment is based on the assumption that the optomechanical coupling is much weaker than the mechanical frequency , and thus does not seriously modify the eigenstates of this system . under this assumption , each system mode is only affected by their corresponding bath modes . however , in the single - photon strong or ultrastrong coupling regime , photons in the eigenstates are strongly dressed by phonon excitations of the mechanical mode , and this assumption is not valid anymore  @xcite .    here",
    "we study the quantum coherence and dynamics of an optomechanical system in the ultrastrong coupling regime with an appropriate master equation approach . in our method",
    ", we decompose the system operators in terms of the eigenstates ( dressed states ) of the optomechanical system and derive the master equation under this decomposition .",
    "this approach was previously used to study strongly - coupled harmonic oscillators with linear coupling  @xcite and a mechanical resonator coupled to a two - level - system defect  @xcite .",

    "it is originated from mechanical bath modes that influence the state of the cavity via light - matter interaction .",
    "we show that at high temperature our master equation generates faster cavity dephasing and entanglement decay when compared with the sme .",
    "the second - order photon correlation given by our master equation also demonstrates more classical behavior than that of the sme at high temperature , predicting photon bunching in some regions of photon antibunching predicted by the sme .",
