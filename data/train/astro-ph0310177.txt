    "neutron star atmosphere models predicted the presence of absorption features depending on atmospheric composition , but high quality spectra , collected both by and by , did not yield evidence for any feature ( see pavlov et al .",

    "ins spectra are well fitted by one or more black - body curves with , possibly , a power law contribution at higher energies , but with no absorption or emission features .",
    "+ the spectrum of 1e1207.4 - 5209 , on the contrary , is dominated by two broad absorption features seen , at 0.7 and 1.4 kev , both by ( sanwal et al , 2002 ) and ( mereghetti et al , 2002 ) . to better understand the nature of such features , devoted two orbits , for a total observing time of 257,303 sec , to 1e1207.4 - 5209 . in the two mos epic cameras the source yielded 74,600 and 76,700 photons in the energy range 0.2 - 3.5 kev , while the pn camera recorded 208,000 photons , time - tagged to allow for timing studies .",
    "analysis of this long observation , while confirming the two phase - dependent absorption lines at 0.7 and 1.4 kev , unveiled a statistically significant third line at @xmath02.1 kev , as well as a possible fourth feature at 2.8 kev . the nearly 1:2:3:4 ratio of the line centroids , as well as the phase variation , naturally following the pulsar b - field rotation , strongly suggest that such lines are due to cyclotron resonance scattering ( bignami et al .",
    "a recent software release , based on a better characterization of the epic instrument , prompted us to revisit the data . while the spectral analysis results confirm and strengthen the conlusions of bignami et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the temporal and spatial analysis yielded interesting new results which we shall briefly outline ( see de luca et al . 2003 for details ) .",
    "after converting the arrival times of the 208,000 pn photons to the solar system barycenter , we searched the period range from 424.12 to 424.14 ms using both a folding algorithm with 8 phase bins and the rayleigh test .",
    "the best period value and its uncertainty ( p = 424.13076@xmath10.00002 ms ) were determined following the procedure outlined in mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . comparing the new period measurement of with that obtained with in january 2000 ( pavlov et al .",
    "2002b ) , we obtain a period derivative @xmath2=(1.4@xmath10.3)@xmath310@xmath4 s s@xmath5 .",
    "however , fig.1 ( left panel ) shows that the @xmath2 value rests totally on the first period measurement . using only the 3 most recent values ,",
    "the period derivative is unconstrained .",
    "thus , we can not exclude that the observed spin - down , based on only a few sparse measurements , be affected by glitches or doppler shifts induced by orbital motion .",
    "questioning the object s @xmath2 would have far reaching consequences for the understanding of 1e1207.4 - 5209 since the serious discrepancy between the pulsar characteritic age ( @xmath6 yrs ) and the snr age ( @xmath7 kyrs ) is entirely based on the value inferred from the measurements summarized in fig .  1 ( left panel ) .    to study the energy dependence of the pulse profile , we divided the data in four channels with approximately 52,000 counts each : 0.2 - 0.52 kev , 0.52 - 0.82 kev , 0.82 - 1.14 kev and 1.14 - 3.5 kev .",
    "the pulse profiles in the different energy ranges ( fig .  1 , right panel ) show a broad , nearly sinusoidal shape , with a pulsed fraction varying from @xmath0 3 to @xmath0 11 % in the four energy intervals .",
    "it is worth noting that the minimum pulsed fraction is found in the 0.20 - 0.52 kev energy range , the only portion of the spectrum free from absorption lines .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "1 ( right panel ) is an independent confirmation of the findings of bignami et al ( 2003 ) who ascribed the source pulsation to the absorption lines phase variation .    finally , comparing the shapes of the light curves of fig .  1 ( right )",
    ", we see for the first time a phase shift of nearly 90@xmath8 between the profile in the lowest energy range ( @xmath90.52 kev ) and those at higher energies .",
    "to derive the sky coordinates of we computed independently for the mos1 and mos2 cameras the boresight correction to be applied to the default epic astrometry .",
    "we used the guide star catalog ii ( gsc - ii ) to select , amongst our @xmath0200 serendipitous detections , 6 sources with a stellar counterpart to be used to correct the epic astrometry .",
    "the rms error between the refined x - ray and gsc - ii positions is @xmath01 arcsec per coordinate .",
    "the resulting mos1 position of is @xmath10 , @xmath11 with an overall error radius of 1.5 arcsec .",
    "the mos2 position is @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcsec , fully consistent with the mos1 coordinates .",
    "the field of 1e 1207@xmath145209 was observed with the 8.2-meter ut-1 telescope ( antu ) of the eso vlt ( paranal observatory ) .",

    "its position falls more than 2 arcsec away from the intersection of the mos1/mos2 error circles , which we regard as the most probable region . +",
