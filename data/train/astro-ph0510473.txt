    "molecular clouds are the sites of star formation , and play a crucial role in controlling the evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the physical conditions of molecular clouds and star formation therein under various physical conditions .",
    "previous efforts to study molecular clouds have been mostly concentrated toward the inner galaxy .",
    "these studies revealed the existence of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) having masses of 10@xmath15 to 10@xmath18 @xmath16 , and that gmcs are actively forming both high - mass and low - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outer part of the galactic disk is probably under significantly different physical conditions compared to the inner disk in several respects , including weaker stellar gravity , lower hi density , less intense uv fields and smaller cosmic ray flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also known that the metallicity becomes lower in the outer galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , naturally we need to study the outer galaxy , a unique nearby laboratory , to make new tests on how properties of star formation such as mass function , star formation efficiency etc",
    ". may change , depending on the above physical parameters .",
    "optical components in the outer galaxy are being revealed gradually .",
    "a deep photometric survey of late - type stars ( mostly g and k dwarfs ) toward the galactic anticenter by @xcite indicates a sharp cutoff of the old stellar disk beyond @xmath19 = 14 kpc .",
    "on the other hand , population i stars apparently have a greater radial extent although they are not so many .",
    "some hii regions have been found and studied at the outer edge of the galaxy at @xmath19 = 15 - 19 kpc , suggesting that star formation is taking place there at a lower level ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus very intriguing to study the dense molecular clouds and star formation in the outer galaxy .    to reveal the molecular distribution in the outer galaxy",
    ", several efforts have been made to date to search for molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite were the first to report the detection of low - level co emission from molecular clouds in the first quadrant of the outer galaxy .",
    "although these studies cover a range of galactocentric distances ( @xmath19 ) from 8.5 kpc to 20 kpc and distances from the galactic plane ( @xmath20 ) of up to 1.5 kpc , they are limited in spatial resolution @xcite or spatial coverage @xcite or are biased toward bright iras point sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed @xmath21co(@xmath22 = 10 ) emission with sest and iram telescopes in the direction of 1302 cold iras sources in the second and third galactic quadrants and gave a catalog of those clouds ( wb clouds , hereafter ) , providing a most comprehensive view of star - forming molecular clouds in the outer galaxy @xcite .",
    "we shall hereafter refer to the outer edge of the part , @xmath4 14.5 kpc , as the far - outer galaxy following @xcite who first used this word for @xmath4 16 kpc . nonetheless , it is still not well known if there is a significant amount of non - star - forming molecular gas in the outer galaxy .",
    "the importance of an unbiased study of molecular clouds covering non - star - forming clouds has been demonstrated by a number of authors over a large mass range , including those papers on cloud cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) and on the giant molecular clouds in the large magellanic cloud and m33 @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite studied the properties of star - forming regions associated with 63 outer galaxy ( @xmath23 13.5 kpc ) molecular clouds , among which the most massive ones have molecular masses of @xmath710@xmath24 @xmath16 , within a 60 deg@xmath25 area toward the second galactic quadrant based on an unbiased co survey of the outer galaxy at fcrao @xcite .",
    "the survey has shown that the number of the molecular clouds dramatically decreases beyond @xmath19 = 13.5 kpc .",
    "about 10 clouds among the 63 have been found to be forming stellar clusters as revealed by k-band imaging , and 39/246 clouds at @xmath23 13.5 kpc have 2mass extended source(s ) that are candidates for star - forming sites @xcite .",
    "@xcite decomposed the fcrao data by applying a lower threshold for radiation temperature and doubled the sample of molecular clouds in the far - outer galaxy in the second galactic quadrant .",
    "these 2 papers show a possibility that a significant fraction of molecular clouds quiet in star formation still remains unobserved in the far - outer galaxy .",
    "it is therefore an important task to better and firmly establish the properties of both star - forming and non - star - forming molecular clouds in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the molecular gas in the outer galaxy .",
    "this goal should be attained by a large unbiased - sample of molecular clouds in the far - outer galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we describe the first results of the co @xmath22 = 10 survey of the third galactic quadrant covering 56 square degrees for a velocity range corresponding to the far - outer galaxy at @xmath19 = 14.5 - 19 kpc .",
    "we shall here focus on the southern warp which shows a large shift from @xmath2 = 0@xmath1 by keeping in mind that the warp is potentially an ideal place to avoid contamination from the galactic disk at every wavelength .",
    "the present work should be complementary to the work by @xcite which studied the northern warp . in this paper , details of the observations",
    "are given in section 2 and the results in section 3 .",
    "analysis and discussion are given in sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "observations were made in the @xmath22 = 10 @xmath21co emission line at 2.6 mm wavelength .",
    "the observed region is a part of the warp in the outer edge of the galaxy .",
    "the distribution of the galactic warp was first recognized in the 21 cm hi emission @xcite and @xcite revealed a pair of significantly warped regions in the hi disk up to 1.5 kpc in @xmath20 .",
    "more recent papers on the hi warp may be found elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the present region is the southern part of the warp , located mainly in the galactic third quadrant .",
    "the parkes 21 cm hi survey @xcite was used to select the region at @xmath0 = 252@xmath1 - 266@xmath1 , and @xmath2 = @xmath35@xmath1-@xmath31@xmath1 , where the hi emission is relatively strong at @xmath19 @xmath26 14.5 kpc and the angular deviation of the warp from @xmath2 = 0@xmath1 is largest .",
    "the area observed corresponds to about 56 square degrees in the sky .",
    "observations were made with the nanten telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile in the period from july 2001 to august 2002 .",
    "the main - dish diameter of the telescope is 4 m , providing a half - power beamwidth ( hpbw ) of 2.6 arcmin at 2.6 mm wavelength .",
    "this corresponds to a spatial resolution of 7.5 pc at a distance of 10 kpc , a typical distance to the southern warp region .",
    "the front - end was an sis mixer receiver .",
    "system temperature including the atmosphere was typically 200 - 250 k in ssb toward the zenith @xcite .",
    "we used two types of spectrometers .",
    "one of them was an acousto - optical spectrometer ( aos ) which provided a velocity resolution of 0.65 km s@xmath27 with a velocity coverage of 650 km s@xmath27 ( the wide band ( wb ) aos ) .",
    "the other had a velocity resolution of 0.1 km s@xmath27 for a velocity span of 100 km s@xmath27 ( the narrow band ( nb ) aos ) .",
    "the pointing accuracy was better than 20 arcsec , as checked by optical observations of stars with a ccd camera attached to the telescope , as well as by radio observations of jupiter , venus , and the edge of the sun . in reducing the spectral data , we subtracted second - order or third - order polynomials determined from the emission - free velocity parts in order to ensure a flat spectral baseline .",
    "an absolute intensity calibration to obtain @xmath28 was made in the chopper - wheel method . in order to convert @xmath28 into @xmath29",
    "we assume that target sources are extended compared with beam size .",
    "we observed orion kl [ @xmath30(1950 ) = 5@xmath3132@xmath3247.@xmath330 , @xmath34(1950 ) = @xmath35@xmath124@xmath3521@xmath36 every two hours , and the peak @xmath29 was taken as 65 k. all the observations were performed in the position - switching mode .",
    "`` off '' positions , chosen to be as close as possible to `` on '' positions within two degrees , were checked to be emission - free at rms noise level of 0.07 k / ch in @xmath29 for both ( wb and nb ) aoss .",
    "first , we observed the whole region at a 4 arcmin grid spacing with wb aos .",
    "the coverage is thus under - sampled with a sampling fraction of 33% .",
    "the rms noise level in these observations was 0.2 k for 0.65 km s@xmath27 resolution .",
    "next , we observed the regions of co emission detected at a 2@xmath37 noise level at @xmath38 @xmath39 90 km s@xmath27 at a 2 arcmin grid spacing with nb aos .",
    "the rms noise fluctuations were 0.25 k for 0.1 km s@xmath27 resolution .",
    "if we adopt a flat rotation curve ( @xmath40 = 8.5 kpc , @xmath41 = 220 km s@xmath27 , @xcite ) , the velocity threshold of 90 km s@xmath27 corresponds to @xmath19 = 14.9 kpc at @xmath0 = 252@xmath1 and @xmath19 = 14.4 kpc at @xmath0 = 266@xmath1 , respectively , and the maximum velocity covered @xmath38 = 160 km s@xmath27 corresponds to @xmath19 = 36 kpc at @xmath0 = 252@xmath1 and @xmath19 = 31 kpc at @xmath0 = 266@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the total numbers of the observed positions in the 4 arcmin and 2 arcmin observations were @xmath713000 and @xmath77500 , respectively .",

    "another possibility for uncertainties in distance is systematic large non - circular motions such as a streaming .",
    "this is difficult to estimate quantitatively , and is assumed here to be negligible because streaming is usually prominent only in the vicinity of spiral arms .",
    "thus , the overall uncertainty is up to 17% in distance .",

    "it is well known that the @xmath21co emitting region is larger than the @xmath66co emitting region in a given cloud ; a typical mass ratio of @xmath21co and @xmath66co emitting regions are @xmath73 in the local clouds ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and this is generally interpreted in terms of different self - shielding against far ultraviolet radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the velocity space , this difference manifests itself as the broader line profile in @xmath21co than in @xmath66co , and the @xmath21co line profiles indeed exhibit emission in a velocity range where no @xmath66co emission is seen . taking this into consideration ,",
    "we need to accept that the molecular column density derived from @xmath66co refers to only the @xmath66co emitting region , although the whole @xmath21co emitting region should be more extended and more massive than the @xmath66co emitting region .",
    "therefore , the molecular column density derived from @xmath66co should be smaller than that derived from @xmath21co reflecting the @xmath21co/@xmath66co cloud mass ratio , @xmath73 ; it is likely that the exact ratio in column density may depend on the cloud geometry . in order to reconcile this with the results of bw95 and @xcite",
    ", we have two alternatives ; one is that the ratio h@xmath11/@xmath66co may be smaller than bw95 assumed and the other is that the @xmath9 factor is larger in the warp than in the inner disk .",
    "the latter is actually in accord with the present result and is perhaps more likely ( see also sect .",
    "we thus confirm the present conclusion that the @xmath9 factor in the warp is a factor of 3.5 larger than in the inner disk , noting that the conclusion by bw95 and @xcite needs to be carefully reexamined by considering the @xmath21co/@xmath66co cloud mass ratio .",
    "in order to compare the warp clouds with the clouds in the galactic disk , we have created a diagram of physical parameters that include clouds in the warp and the carina arm as shown in figures 5 .",
    "we have chosen here the carina arm because the region was observed with the same instrument , nanten ( matsunaga et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , and because cloud parameters can be better defined with less confusion than in the inner disk .",
    "the co data of carina were taken at rms sensitivity @xmath70.3 k with wb aos , 3 times worse than that for the warp clouds , and at a 4 arcmin grid spacing , twice of that for the warp .",
    "these observational parameters place the lower limit in cloud mass 20 times higher than in the warp .",
    "we have thus used only the reliable sample clouds in carina whose mass is greater than 16,000 @xmath16 and restricted the cloud distances from the sun ( @xmath43 ) in a range from 10.3 kpc to 15.3 kpc , the same range for the warp clouds .",
    "figure 5 gives the size - linewidth relation for the same sample of co , a relationship often used to characterize the physical properties of clouds . in this figure",
    ", we also plotted the beam - corrected size ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) of the warp clouds ( crosses ) and the carina arm clouds ( circles ) in addition to the far - outer galaxy clouds in the second galactic quadrant observed by @xcite .",
    "the broken line and dotted line are least - squares fits calculated by bw95 for the inner- ( @xmath19 @xmath57 8.5 kpc ) and outer - galaxy clouds ( @xmath19 @xmath26 8.5 kpc ) , respectively .",
    "the diagram shows that molecular clouds in the far - outer galaxy , from nanten and fcrao data , are roughly consistent with the outer galaxy line by bw95 .",
    "this also clearly indicates that the outer galaxy clouds are characterized by linewidths a factor of two smaller than the inner galaxy clouds ( see also figure 10 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the carina clouds are located between the two lines for the outer galaxy and for the inner galaxy .",
    "if correct , this suggests that the clouds in the disk may have a gradient in linewidth as a function of @xmath19 , which should be tested by a more extensive dataset in the future .    here",
    ", we will again discuss on the @xmath9 factor based on the above relations in order to obtain a deeper insight into the cause of the larger @xmath9 factor in the warp .",
    "if we denote the cloud size in the far - outer galaxy and in the inner disk as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , the size - linewidth relation in figure 5 is expressed as d@xmath692@xmath14(@xmath67)@xmath47 and d@xmath70(@xmath68)@xmath47 , respectively . on the other hand , bw95 ( fig .",
    "13 ) showed that @xmath71 d@xmath72 ; we have confirmed this relation holds also for the present warp clouds(see appendix and figure 10 ) . by using the above equations and @xmath73d@xmath52 , we find that @xmath42 in the far - outer galaxy is one fourth of @xmath42 in the inner disk .",
    "this offers a simple explanation of how the @xmath9 factor becomes larger by a factor of 3.5(@xmath74 ) in the warp , providing further support for the present @xmath9 factor .      the co distribution is superposed on the hi @xcite distribution in the @xmath0-@xmath2 diagram ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this figure indicates that the hi and co are well correlated with each other in the sense that the co clouds , while much clumpier than hi , are distributed mostly toward the intense hi emission . to be more quantitative , 93% (= 65/70 ) of the co clouds",
    "are located within the 800 k km s@xmath27 contour level of hi in figure 6 .",
    "figure 7 shows the distance @xmath74 from the galactic mid plane as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the peak positions of co clouds are superimposed on an hi intensity map integrated between @xmath0 = 252@xmath1 and 266@xmath1 from the hi data .",
    "this clearly shows that the co clouds are distributed up to @xmath19 = 18.6 kpc and there is no molecular cloud beyond this radius as is consistent with bw94 .",
    "the trend that @xmath20 increases with @xmath19 is clearly seen , an obvious sign of the warp .",
    "@xcite also showed the sign of warp structure by co and hi observations on an @xmath0-@xmath74 map .",
    "comparisons between the hi and co in figures 6 and 7 indicate that the warp clouds are not distributed uniformly , but that they are distributed in some groups extended over a few degrees , coinciding with larger hi distributions of similar extents . in figure 7 one",
    "also sees that the @xmath74-distribution of the molecular clouds becomes wider with increasing @xmath19 , a sign of the flaring of the molecular disk .",
    "figure 8 shows a face - on view of the outer disk .",
    "the peak positions of co clouds in the warp and the carina arm are superimposed on an hi column density map from the hi data at @xmath38 @xmath39 10 km s@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we used an intensity - mass conversion factor of 1.82@xmath1410@xmath75 [ @xmath59/k km s@xmath27 ] to calculate hi mass .",
    "thin broken contours indicate a column density of 0.5@xmath1410@xmath76 @xmath59 . for the warp and the carina arm ,",
    "the total molecular mass is estimated as 7.3@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 and 2.1@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16 , respectively , while that of hi is calculated to be 4.4@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16 and 14.5@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we applied a standard conversion factor , @xmath9 = 2@xmath1410@xmath60 [ @xmath59/k km s@xmath27 ] , for the carina clouds to calculate their masses . by using the total area ( 11 kpc@xmath25 for the warp and 24 kpc@xmath25 for the carina arm ) , averaged surface densities of h@xmath77 and hi in the warp and the carina arm are calculated within the thick broken line and are listed in table 2 along with the corresponding values in other regions of the galaxy , i.e. , the inner disk , the perseus arm and the interarm , and in the lmc for reference .",
    "we find that the molecular cloud mass in the warp is @xmath71% of the total hydrogen mass .",
    "this ratio is significantly less than that in the carina arm ( 14% ) or in the perseus arm ( 11% ) or in the inner disk ( 50% ) , but is similar to that in the interarm ( 1% ) .",
    "the ratio is also much less than that in one of the nearest galaxies , the lmc @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the conclusion reached by @xcite for the northern far - outer galaxy and suggests that the conversion efficiency from atomic to molecular gas is ten times smaller in the far - outer galaxy than in the inner disk .",
    "the disk layer thickness ( fwhm ) of hi gas increases with @xmath19 , 400 pc at @xmath19 = 10 kpc and 600 pc at @xmath19 = 16 kpc @xcite , and the hi mass density is calculated as 1.5@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16/kpc@xmath78 and 0.7@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16/kpc@xmath78 for the carina arm and the warp , respectively .",
    "we suggest that this hi density decrease by a factor of 2 may lead to the lower efficiency of conversion into molecular gas in the warp .",
    "we shall discuss the total molecular mass in the far - outer galaxy .",
    "the total molecular mass is estimated to be 7.3@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 in the present region of the southern warp .",
    "the area of the present survey corresponds to 3.5% of the area at @xmath19 = 14.5 - 19 kpc .",
    "if we assume the proportion of molecular cloud in the far - outer galaxy is uniform , the total molecular mass in the far - outer galaxy is estimated to be 2.1@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16 by simply multiplying 100/3.5 to 7.3@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "we can also check the total molecular mass in the same way by using the fcrao data from the on - line catalog @xcite .",
    "@xcite found 117 clouds at @xmath19 @xmath39 14.5 kpc within a region extending 40 deg in longitude , three times larger than the area in our survey , and gave @xmath42 for each .",

    "is calculated to be 5.0@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 ( total co luminosity is 4.1@xmath1410@xmath24 k km s@xmath27 pc@xmath25 ) , if the same @xmath9 factor as in the warp is applied . by assuming a uniform molecular cloud distribution over the far - outer galaxy",
    ", the total molecular mass is estimated to be 8@xmath1410@xmath18 @xmath16 , somewhat smaller than the above for the southern warp .",
    "this may be due to a moderate asymmetry in molecular mass between the south and north , while the difference is only within a factor of two .",
    "we thus infer that the current best estimate for the total molecular mass in the far - outer galaxy is 1 - 2@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16 .",
    "the total hi mass in the far - outer galaxy is @xmath72@xmath1410@xmath79 @xmath16 as derived by a few groups @xcite , and the overall molecular / atomic ratio is 0.5 - 1% . on the other hand , @xcite estimated the total molecular mass at 8.5 @xmath80 14.5 to be 2@xmath1410@xmath81 @xmath16 ( @xmath9 = 1.56@xmath14 10@xmath60 [ @xmath59/k km s@xmath27 ] ) .",
    "we thus infer that the total molecular mass in the far - outer galaxy is 5 - 10% ( depending on @xmath9 ; see @xcite ) of that in the outer galaxy .      in order to investigate star formation in the warp clouds",
    "we have used the iras point source catalog to select possible candidates for ysos associated with the 70 warp clouds .",
    "cold iras point sources ( @xmath82 @xmath57 @xmath83 with qualities @xmath39 2 at both bands 25 @xmath84 m and 60 @xmath84 m ) are associated with the peak co emission in only 6 clouds ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these clouds may be forming massive to intermediate mass ( b type ) stars as judged from their iras flux density ; we roughly estimate the total far - infrared luminosity of these iras sources from the flux densities at 12 - 100 @xmath84 m , as @xmath85 = 2 - 19@xmath1410@xmath78 @xmath86 , where we use a simple method of estimating @xmath85 from the sum of the fluxes at 4 bands @xcite .    the @xmath85/@xmath49 ratio for these 6 clouds ranges from 0.1 @xmath86/@xmath16 to 2.7 @xmath86/@xmath16 with an average value of 0.8 @xmath86/@xmath16 .",

    "it has been shown by several authors that the ratio between the virial mass and the luminous mass of molecular clouds is a good indicator of the gravitational relaxation of clouds leading to star formation on large scale ( e.g. , @xcite ) and on small scale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies show that the virial mass derived from the velocity dispersion of molecular spectra tends to become smaller for clouds with star formation , and that star formation takes place for clouds having greater molecular column density .",
    "these are reasonable characteristics that indicate relaxation of the cloud structure under self gravity .    in order to test how the above ratio depends on star formation and cloud mass in the far - outer galaxy ,",
    "we have created a histogram of cloud mass along with the cloud mass ratios .",
    "figure 9 clearly indicates that massive clouds having larger molecular column density form stars ( dark gray ) more often than lower mass ones , a similar trend to the disk clouds ( see the references above ) .",

    "warp structure and flaring are clearly seen in the molecular cloud distribution , as well as in hi .",

    "\\5 ) only 6 of the 70 warp clouds show signs of star formation , i.e. , far - infrared compact sources detected with iras , although the far - infrared observations are sensitive enough only for high mass stars of b type or of earlier .",
    "the star formation efficiency derived from this is a factor of 4 - 5 smaller than that in the northern counterpart of the warp .",
    "we have used the co data of the inner disk clouds from the catalog of @xcite to derive the @xmath9 factor in the warp ( section 4 ) .",
    "there is however a concern about the reliability of the solomon et al.s data because the clouds were defined at a certain high level of the temperature , i.e. , 4 k @xcite .",
    "this was unavoidable due to the continuous high intensity level of the co emission in the inner disk , even in between the clouds .",
    "on the other hand , the present warp clouds are distributed more sparsely , allowing a cloud definition at a very low co integrated intensity of 0.9 k km s@xmath27 .",
    "a natural question here is if the rather high threshold value in the co intensity in the solomon et al.s data may cause some errors in the cloud physical parameters in deriving the @xmath9 factor .",
    "it is therefore important to test if it does not cause any systematic error to use the solomon et al.s results in deriving the @xmath9 factor .",
    "we have used the nanten @xmath21co galactic plan survey results ( @xmath90 60@xmath1 ) on the solomon et al.s clouds . from the nanten dataset",
    "we have defined 55 clouds which are coincident with the distance calibrator clouds in the solomon et al.s catalog which includes 273 clouds , and provided three diagrams in figure 10 , i.e. , @xmath42-@xmath50 , size - linewidth , and @xmath42-linewidth relations .",
    "details of the definition of size and linewidth are not given in bw95 , while the same trend that the inner galaxy clouds have large linewidths is clearly seen .",
    "for 11 clouds , we calculated @xmath42 and @xmath50 at three different threshold values of co integrated intensity in order to investigate the dependence on the observational sensitivity .",
    "spectra of the nanten toward no .",
    "181 cloud ( from the solomon et al s catalog ) , for instance , are shown in figure 11 , for the three lowest integrated intensity ( and temperature ) values of 53.8(4.6 ) , 12.8(1.3 ) , and 5.3(0.4 ) k km s@xmath27(k ) , respectively .",
    "figure 12 indicates the correlations between @xmath42 and @xmath50 , showing that plots move along the least - squares fit for the 55 clouds , log(@xmath50 ) = 0.91@xmath14log(@xmath42)+1.11 ( c.c = 0.91 ) .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that the regression does not change depending on the threshold co intensity among the nanten datasets and that the present analysis is fairly consistent with the solomon et al.s regression employed in the present work .",
    "the individual values of @xmath42 and @xmath50 of course depend on the threshold and changes a little as shown in figure 12 . keeping in mind that the determination of the @xmath9 factor actually mainly depends on relative shift among the regressions in figure 12 ,",
    "we conclude that the high threshold value in the solomon et al.s data are not likely the cause of any significant error in the present work .",

    "<S> we have made an unbiased survey for molecular clouds in the galactic warp . </S>",
    "<S> this survey , covering an area of 56 square degrees at @xmath0 = 252@xmath1 to 266@xmath1 and @xmath2 = @xmath35@xmath1 to @xmath31@xmath1 , has revealed 70 molecular clouds , while only 6 clouds were previously known in the region . </S>",
    "<S> the number of molecular clouds is , then , an order of magnitude greater than previously known in this sector at @xmath4 14.5 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the clouds is in a range from 7.8@xmath5 to 8.4@xmath6 , significantly less than the most massive giant molecular clouds in the inner disk , @xmath710@xmath8 , while the cloud mass spectrum characterized by a power law is basically similar to other parts of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 factor , @xmath10(h@xmath11)/@xmath12 , derived from the molecular clouds in the warp is estimated to be 3.5(@xmath131.8 ) times larger than that in the inner disk . </S>",
    "<S> the total molecular mass in the warp is estimated as 7.3@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath16 , and total mass in the far - outer galaxy ( @xmath4 14.5 kpc ) can be estimated as 2@xmath1410@xmath17 @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial correlation between the co and hi distribution appears fairly good , and the mass of the molecular gas is about 1% of that of the atomic gas in the far - outer galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is similar to that in the interarm but is ten times smaller than those of the spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> only 6 of the 70 warp clouds show signs of star formation at the iras sensitivity and star formation efficiency for high - mass stars in the warp is found to be smaller than those in other molecular clouds in the galaxy . </S>"
