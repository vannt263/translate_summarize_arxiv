    "during the past decade various young stellar associations and clusters have been identified within 100pc of the sun ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "these comoving groups can illuminate our understanding of the properties of low and intermediate mass stars at times that correspond to the long - ago era when planet building and heavy bombardment were occurring in our solar system .",
    "the spitzer infrared observatory is targeting virtually all these young stars to determine if they are surrounded by dusty debris disks . and",
    "the stars are being observed at near - infrared wavelengths with the hubble space telescope and with adaptive optics systems on most of the world s largest telescopes ; the goal is to detect thermal emission from young massive planets .    in the present letter",
    "we add another example  the carina - near moving group  to the growing menagerie of nearby young associations .",
    "the nucleus  consisting of stars in the relatively narrow range of spectral type f through k0 of which hr3070 (= hip  38160 ) is the earliest spectral type and the brightest  is only @xmath030pc from earth ( table  1 ) .",
    "some of the surrounding stream stars , whose group membership is therefore less secure than those in the nucleus , are even closer to earth ; for example , gj358 is within 10pc . based primarily on lithium abundance and x - ray flux ( see section  [ sec3 ] )",
    ", we estimate the group to be somewhat older than the pleiades .",
    "some nuclear stars in our proposed group were initially suggested as co - moving by @xcite .",
    "later , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mu2000 ) argued that they are part of a spatially very extensive , x - ray bright , moving group they dubbed `` carina - vela '' .",
    "however , other than x - ray luminosity , their choice of group membership was predicated entirely on kinematics , while lacking even radial velocity determinations .",
    "our past experience @xcite with stars proposed @xcite as members of the tw hydrae association , demonstrated that a purely convergent - point kinematic approach is insufficient to reliably pinpoint members of nearby young associations . nonetheless , in the 5 years following publication of their paper , neither @xcite nor any other astronomer has verified or denied their kinematic model .",
    "for example , both @xcite and @xcite studied group member hip37563 without referencing the mu2000 paper .",
    "indeed , unware of the mu2000 paper , we independently stumbled on the nearer ( to earth ) members of their proposed association while pursuing our research program of identification of young nearby stars .",
    "apparently , in their young star program , @xcite also find some overlap with the mu2000 sample .",
    "however , based on the few stars explicitly mentioned in the jensen  et  al abstract , the stars in their program appear , on average , to be about 3 times more distant from earth than stars in our table  1 .",
    "our investigations of radial velocities and youth indicators such as lithium abundance and h@xmath1 intensity are described in the following sections .",
    "the essence of our results may be summarized as follows : we confirm some of the mu2000 suggested members , deny others , and add some of our own .",
    "in addition , we think it is not helpful , and may even be wrong , to associate very nearby stars such as those listed in table  1 with the much more distant stars that mu2000 place together into a single moving group .",
    "specifically , as is evident from their fig .",
    "5 , the nearest members of their `` carina - vela '' group are three times closer to earth than their proposed more distant members , with essentially no stars at intermediate distances . in view of these large spatial separations ,",
    "lack of evidence that galactic space velocities @xmath2 are all similar , and lack of data on lithium abundances and activity indicators , at present we see no compelling reason to suppose the carina - vela group stars shared a common origin .",
    "table  1 of mu2000 , `` candidate members of the carina - vela moving group '' , contains 58 entries most of which are not particularly near earth .",
    "of these 58 , only 5 are included in our table  1 as candidate members of the moving group of stars we are considering and one mu2000 candidate is a definite non - member of our proposed moving group . rather than being spread out to distances @xmath3pc and with generally unknown @xmath2 ( i.e. mu2000 s carina - vela group ) ,",
    "our table  1a and b stars are characterized by proximity to earth and rather tight constraints ( a few km / s ) on measured @xmath2 velocities .",
    "in addition , stars listed in our table  1b are not in the carina - vela direction . finally , based on our figures 1 and 2 and the discussion in section 3 ,",
    "we believe that the carina - near stars must be older than the pleiades , whereas ic2391 which belongs to the carina - vela moving group proposed by mu2000 is generally regarded as younger than the pleiades . in view of these many differences ,",
    "we designate the stars we are considering to be the `` carina - near moving group '' .",
    "in january 2006 , we obtained spectra of table  1 stars with the double - beam grating and echelle spectrographs on the two nasmyth foci of the australian national university s 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory .",
    "the primary goal of these observations is the measurement of stellar radial velocity along with the equivalent widths of the h@xmath1 and li@xmath4 6708 lines .",
    "radial velocity , in conjunction with proper motion and parallax , enables one to calculate the three - dimensional galactic space motions u , v , w that are essential for identification of individual moving groups .",
    "entries for radial velocity , lithium , and h@xmath1 in table  1 are a mix of our own measurements and those of others .",
    "u , v , w was calculated using weighted averages of proper motions from the ppm and tycho catalogs and occasionally a third catalog and of radial velocities measured by us and by others . for stars that are obviously binaries based on their small separation in the plane of the sky , for example hip37918 and 37923",
    ", we used the weighted mean of their hipparcos measured distances to calculate the uvws listed in table  1 .",
    "we have divided table  1 into three parts : ( a ) nuclear members of the carina - near moving group , ( b ) suggested `` stream '' members associated with the group , and ( c ) stars suggested in mu2000 as comoving but rejected by us as group members based on uvw . for moving groups with ages @xmath5myr , mid and late m - type stars located above the main sequence",
    "are probably the most reliable way to establish age ( see , e.g. , discussion and fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "however , we could identify no stars noticeably above the main sequence among our proposed group members .",
    "the absence of such pre - main sequence stars is consistent with our @xmath6myr age estimate for the group ( section  [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "lacking any m - type stars that lie above the main sequence , we estimate the age of the carina - near group using lithium abundance plus activity indicators .",
    "figure  [ lithium ] displays li@xmath46708 equivalent width ( ew ) vs. spectral type of carina - near group stars overplotted on fig . 3 from @xcite .",
    "the carina - near stars are seen to lie near the bottom envelope of lithium ew for pleiades stars .",
    "figure  [ xray ] shows the x - ray luminosity of carina - near stars , normalized by their bolometric luminosities , overplotted on fig . 4 of @xcite .",
    "again , the carina - near stars lie near the bottom envelope of pleiades stars . finally , we measured h@xmath1 lines in early - m type stars hip47425 and 15844ab and c ( all of which have @xmath7 ) , to be @xmath8,@xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively where a negative sign denotes emission .",
    "comparison with h@xmath1 line activity in stars with similar @xmath11 , see fig .  5 in @xcite and fig . 5 in @xcite",
    ", suggests that these stars are young , but not dramatically so .    with adaptive optics imaging",
    ", @xcite found that gj900 ( hip116384 ) , is a triple system .",
    "martin notes that his referee , j. stauffer , argues that the age of gj900 is 100myr or older based on its position in a @xmath12 vs @xmath13 color - magnitude diagram and comparison with low - mass members of the ic2391 , ic2602 , and pleiades clusters .    our measurements ,",
    "as indicated in figures 1 and 2 , are consistent with stauffer s assessment and we assign an age of @xmath14myr to the carina - near moving group .    a remarkable aspect of the stars listed in parts ( a ) and ( b ) of table 1 is the dominance of multiple star systems",
    ". only hip36414 , 37635 and 47425 appear , at this time , to be likely single stars .",
    "the situation regarding hip37563 and 38160 is unclear . while hip37563 and 38160 might be single stars ( they are fairly far from each other in the plane of the sky ) , it is possible that either one or both might comprise a very wide multiple system with binary star hip37918 & 37923 .",
    "specifically , hip37563 and 38160 are each separated in the plane of the sky by about one light year from hip37918 & 37923 .",
    "if the separation along the line of sight is comparable ( or less ) , then hip37563 or 38160 or both could , with 37918 & 37923 , be a very wide triple or quadruple system .",
    "in their section 5 , mu2000 comment that `` surprisingly many '' of their proposed carina - vela group stars are members of binaries ; this trait , they note , may be characteristic of stellar youth .",
    "if so , then such youthful affinity for multiplicity has been preserved for @xmath6myr in the carina - near group .",
    "we have identified a group of comoving @xmath0200myr old stars that partially surround the sun .",
    "at least four of these stars are close enough to earth to have been included in the original gliese catalog of nearby stars ( 1969 ) : gj140 , 358 , 900 , and 907.1 .",
    "like all previously discovered and younger associations of stars within 100pc of earth  tw  hydrae , tucana / horologium , @xmath15  pictoris , ab  doradus , @xmath16  cha , cha - near  the nucleus of the carina - near moving group is located deep in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this nucleus , is ( coincidentally ) located quite close to the nucleus of the ab  doradus moving group notwithstanding that the two groups have substantially different ages and galactic space motions , uvw : ab  dor @xmath17 ; carina - near @xmath18 . indeed , the u velocity of the carina - near group is substantially more negative than the u velocities of all the other groups listed here . in any event ,",
    "identification of this nearby group of stars , many of which have masses similar to the sun , extends the time - line covered by these other groups to older ages .",
    "as instrumentation capabilities improve , astronomers will be able to follow the planetary formation process over the age interval from 8 to 200myr .",
