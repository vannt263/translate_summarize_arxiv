    "ferrofluids @xcite are suspensions of ferromagnetic particles of about 10 nm diameter in a carrier fluid .",
    "the particles are stabilized against aggregation by coating with polymers or by electrostatic repulsion of charges brought on their surface .",
    "on macroscopic scales , ferrofluids can be described as liquids with intrinsic superparamagnetic properties .    in this paper , we are concerned with the equilibrium magnetization @xmath0 as a function of the internal magnetic field @xmath1 for given temperature and particle concentration .",
    "sufficiently low concentrated ferrofluids behave like a paramagnetic gas .",
    "therein the interaction between the particles can be neglected and the equilibrium magnetization can be described properly by the langevin function .",
    "the magnetic properties are then necessarily weak . to produce ferrofluids with strong magnetic properties one has to have either a higher particle concentration or one has to use ferromagnetic material with a large bulk magnetization , e.  g. , cobalt instead of magnetite . in both cases the magnetization is strongly influenced by dipole ",
    "dipole and other interactions between the particles .",
    "several models of dipolar interacting systems have been studied in the literature .",
    "numerical investigations were based on density functional approaches @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the models differ in the treatment of the short range interactions , which were described by hard sphere @xcite , other hard core potentials @xcite , soft sphere @xcite , or lenard  jones potentials @xcite .",
    "these investigations were mainly undertaken to reveal the phase transition properties .",
    "these properties are substantially different for different short range interactions .",
    "thus , for example the question whether a system of particles interacting via long range dipolar forces shows without any dispersive energy , e.  g. , from attractive van der waals energy a `` liquid  vapor '' phase coexistence of a dense and a less dense phase is currently being discussed @xcite .",
    "analytical models focus mainly on the equilibrium magnetization in the gas phase ( were the term `` gas '' refers , as far as ferrofluids are addressed , to the magnetic particle subsystem within the liquid carrier ) .",
    "such models are the onsager model @xcite , the weiss model @xcite , the mean spherical approximation @xcite , and an approach by buyevich and ivanov @xcite ( called high temperature approximation in @xcite ) .",
    "these models were tested experimentally for ferrofluids @xcite .",
    "especially the mean spherical model and the high temperature approximation showed good results @xcite .",
    "our approach assumes the magnetic particles in the ferrofluid to be hard spheres with a common diameter @xmath2 and dipolar moment @xmath3 .",
    "we use the technique of the born  mayer expansion @xcite together with an expansion in the strength of the dipolar coupling to get analytical approximations .",
    "they are obtained via series expansions of the free energy in terms of two parameters : ( i ) the volume fraction of the hard core particles @xmath4 and ( ii ) a dimensionless dipolar coupling constant @xmath5 , given by the ratio between a typical dipolar energy for particles in hard core contact and the thermal energy @xmath6 .",
    "our result for the magnetization goes beyond the high temperature approximation @xcite and reduces to it in linear order in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "dipolar forces fall off as @xmath7 and are thus of long range nature .",
    "this long range character requires great care when invoking the thermodynamic limit @xcite . to circumvent the problem we model the dipolar fields that are generated by distant particles by a magnetic continuum field ( similar to the treatment in the weiss model ) while incorporating the near field contributions explicitly in a statistical mechanical description .",
    "the magnetization @xmath0 is then derived as a function of the internal magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the so obtained relation @xmath8 is independent of the probe geometry .",
    "once @xmath8 is known , the magnetization for a given geometry can in principle be derived by solving the macroscopic maxwell equations .",
    "this may practically still be a difficult task , at least as long as the external field is small or absent . in this case",
    "it is known that the magnetization will show for general shaped probes a nontrivial spatial variation at high enough densities @xcite .    since our method yields an expression for the free energy of the model system we can in principle calculate also other thermodynamic quantities and in particular address the questions of phase transition , e.  g. , between gas and liquid or between ferromagnetic and non  ferromagnetic phases .",
    "we have not addressed the question of a gas  liquid transition of the magnetic particles suspended in the ferrofluid since it is believed that short range van der waals  like attractions would have to be incorporated to model real ferrofluids appropriately in this regard @xcite . however , the question whether a strong dipolar coupling induces in zero external field a spontaneous magnetization that is currently debated in the literature @xcite is briefly touched upon in sec .  [ ferromag ] of this paper .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ model ] we discuss the connections between the various fields that are of relevance in a ferrofluid .",
    "we present the model to treat the long range dipolar forces . in sec .",
    "[ bm ] we present the expansion method to get analytical solutions in terms of the two small parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "[ exp1 ] we calculate an expression for the magnetization that contains only linear terms in @xmath4 but , at least in principle , arbitrary high orders in @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ exp2 ] a different expression is derived containing also quadratic terms in @xmath4 but also only up to second order terms in @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] we discuss our findings and investigate the applicability of the results in the @xmath4@xmath5 plane .",
    "[ conclude ] contains a short conclusion .",
    "we are interested in the effect of dipolar interactions of the magnetic particles in a ferrofluid on the equilibrium magnetization of the ferrofluid . to that end",
    "we consider the ferrofluid as an ensemble of identical spherical particles of diameter @xmath2 , each carrying a magnetic moment of magnitude @xmath3 .",
    "these particles interact with each other via magnetic dipole ",
    "dipole interactions and a hard core repulsion with hard core diameter @xmath2 .",
    "we assume @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the diameter of the magnetic core of the particles thus allowing for a surfactant surface layer that provides a steric repulsion .",
    "the particles can lower their potential energy by orienting their magnetic moments parallel to a local magnetic field .",
    "however any interaction of the particles with the fluid medium they are suspended in is ignored .",
    "the latter is taken to be magnetically inert .",
    "before we outline in sec .",
    "[ decomp ] how we determine in principle the magnetization of the ferrofluid we should like to review briefly the different magnetic fields that one has to distinguish and that are of importance in a system with dipolar interactions .",
    "the first field is the external magnetic field @xmath11 that is applied outside of the probe .",
    "if dipolar interactions can be neglected , @xmath11 is also the field at the position of the particles  at least as long as the carrier fluid can be treated a magnetic vacuum which we will assume throughout the paper . in the presence of dipolar interactions additional fields",
    "have to be considered .",
    "one of them is the internal field @xmath12 , that is the macroscopic field inside the probe . by assuming that the equation of state @xmath13 is known , @xmath12 can be calculated by the common methods of continuum magnetostatics .",
    "but the macroscopic field @xmath12 differs in general from the field @xmath14 that the magnetic particles feel .",
    "so far one has employed in the ferrofluid literature two models to calculate @xmath14 from @xmath12 that are similar in spirit , namely the weiss model @xcite and the onsager model @xcite .",
    "both introduce a virtual hollow sphere inside a magnetic continuum such that the sphere contains a single magnetic particle in its center .",
    "the weiss model assumes the magnetization @xmath15 and the internal field @xmath12 to be constant everywhere in the magnetic continuum surrounding the sphere .",
    "then the field inside the sphere is given by @xmath16 this is the field that the single magnetic particle feels within the weiss model , i.  e.  @xmath17 .    the onsager model , on the other hand ,",
    "is restricted to linearly responding fluids and calculates the field inside the sphere on the assumption that it is really hollow and that therefore @xmath12 and @xmath15 differ near the sphere from its bulk values . in that case",
    "the field within the sphere is @xmath18 @xmath19 is the susceptibility . in both models",
    "the magnetization is calculated as the magnetization of a system of _ noninteracting _ dipoles in the magnetic field @xmath14 , i.  e. , @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the saturation magnetization of the fluid , @xmath22 the langevin function , @xmath3 the magnetic moment of the particles , and @xmath23 their number density . in the onsager model",
    "the langevin function is consistently used only in linear order .",
    "letting @xmath24 on the left hand side of ( [ 2meqn ] ) and using ( [ 2hlocons ] ) allows to calculate @xmath19 .    in the weiss model the selfconsistent solution @xmath8 is determined using ( [ 2meqn ] ) and ( [ 2hlocweiss ] ) .",
    "the onsager and weiss models differ in the treatment of the back reaction of the particle inside the sphere on the magnetic continuum near the sphere s boundary .      since the magnetic continuum is a macroscopic concept one should be careful when using it on the mesoscopic length scales of the interparticle distances and particle diameters . a first ",
    "principle statistical mechanical calculation of the magnetization would start with expressing the energy of the system in terms of the statistical variables of the constituents . in this context the local magnetic field @xmath14 that a magnetic moment , say , at position @xmath25 feels is of importance .",
    "it is composed of two different magnetic fields , the external field @xmath11 and the dipolar contribution @xmath26 from the other @xmath27 particles at positions @xmath28 , possessing a magnetic moment @xmath29 .",
    "thus within the first ",
    "principles approach one has @xmath30 , where @xmath31 here @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the long range character of the dipolar forces requires special care when invoking the thermodynamic limit @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 const . )",
    " for a critical discussion see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the reason is that the dipolar contribution ( [ hdiptotal ] ) will in general depend on the geometry of the ferrofluid probe and the location of @xmath38 within it .",
    "thus the equilibrium magnetization of a probe in an external field will in general depend on the geometry of the latter and furthermore it will be spatially varying .",
    "we therefore use here an approach similar to the one that has been used successfully in solid state theory @xcite to determine , e.  g. , the crystal field splitting caused by local fields .",
    "it properly accounts for the contributions from microscopic and macroscopic scales .",
    "consider some magnetic particle @xmath39 in a ferrofluid probe in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the particles beyond some distance @xmath40 from @xmath25 can be considered as independent from particle @xmath39 if @xmath40 is larger than the correlation length induced by the dipolar interactions .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath40 is large enough , their contribution to the local field at @xmath25 can be approximated by a contribution from a magnetic continuum with equilibrium magnetization @xmath15 and macroscopic field @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the distance @xmath40 is still small compared to the length scale on which the macroscopic fields @xmath15 and @xmath12 vary .",
    "thus we introduce a virtual sphere of radius @xmath40 around particle @xmath39 ( dark particle in the center of fig .  [ ourmod ] ) to separate the dipolar field into a `` far '' and a `` near '' contribution @xmath41 @xmath42 then @xmath43 if the sphere would be empty , @xmath44 would be the local field inside the sphere .    a key point of our treatment is to express the far field @xmath45 within the continuum approximation . using this approach the field in the empty sphere is given by @xmath46 ( [ 2hlocweiss ] ) .",
    "note that this approximation is not valid near the sphere s boundary .",
    "but at the center of the sphere @xmath14 consists of the continuum contribution @xmath47 from the far region and the contribution for the dipoles within the sphere : @xmath48 this result agrees with eq .  (",
    "27.26 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been derived with slightly different arguments for electric dipoles . due to the long range character of the dipolar forces @xmath26",
    "will be in general geometry dependent and spatially varying .",
    "@xmath47 , respectively @xmath12 and @xmath15 will then also show these features as mentioned above .",
    "if the dipolar coupling between the particles is so weak that even the dipolar fields of the nearest neighbours of particle @xmath39 can be described by a continuum field , i.  e. , if @xmath40 can be chosen as being smaller than the mean distance between the particles , we can drop the contribution @xmath49 altogether and arrive at the weiss model , where a single particle is located inside the hollow sphere in the continuum .",
    "we want to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium relation @xmath8 between the magnetization @xmath50 and the macroscopic magnetic field @xmath12 in the thermodynamic limit . instead of considering the dipolar interaction of all particles in an external field in the statistical mechanical problem ( [ stamechprob ] )",
    "we take explicitly only interactions between those particles into account whose distance is smaller than the sphere radius @xmath40 .",
    "the other interactions are represented by the far  field continuum approximation @xmath46 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath51 resulting from this decomposition of fields is then identified with the equilibrium magnetization @xmath8 of the ferrofluid @xmath52 thus after having obtained the approximate expressing for @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 we then obtain from solving ( [ ms_m_h_rela ] ) for @xmath0 an approximation for the sought after equilibrium relation @xmath8 .",
    "the functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is independent of the probe geometry .    in the limit of weak dipolar coupling or",
    "when @xmath40 becomes smaller than the mean distance between the particles we find @xmath55 $ ] so that the weiss model is recovered as discussed above .",
    "the magnetization @xmath53 in ( [ ms_m_h_rela ] ) depends on two dimensionless parameters that characterize the thermodynamic state of the ferrofluid .",
    "one of these parameters is the volume concentration of the particles @xmath56 the ratio @xmath57 of the volume of the magnetic material to the total volume is @xmath58 .",
    "the other parameter is @xmath59 the ratio between a typical energy of dipole  dipole interaction of particles in contact ( i.  e. , at the distance of the hard core diameter @xmath2 ) and the thermal energy @xmath60 .",
    "we use the canonical ensemble average to evaluate @xmath53 . given a system of @xmath61 interacting particles with an interaction potential @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and external potential per particle @xmath64 ,",
    "the canonical partition function is given by @xmath65 here @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 means integration over the configuration space . in our case ,",
    "a configuration is characterized by specifying the position vector @xmath25 and two angles for each magnetic particle .",
    "the two angles define the direction of the magnetic moment @xmath69 .",
    "the modulus @xmath3 is assumed to be constant and the same for all particles . note that we ignore any translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the particles that carry the magnetic moments , since they have no effect on the magnetization .",
    "only the locations of the moments , i.  e. , of the particles and the orientations of the moments are considered as statistical variables .    in the first ",
    "principles statistical mechanical problem identified by a superscript @xmath70 , the external potential would be the energy of a dipole in the external magnetic field @xmath71 the interparticle potential is modelled by a dipole  dipole ( dd ) interaction plus hard core ( hc ) repulsion .",
    "thus @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74    the replacement of the dipolar magnetic fields from far  away particles by a field that has its origin in a magnetic continuum results in a new canonical partition function with the `` external '' potential of a dipole @xmath75 in the field @xmath46 and a dipolar interaction term with a cutoff , i.  e. , @xmath76    note that when using ( [ viconti ] ) and ( [ vijconti ] ) in the expression ( [ candistrigen ] ) for the partition function we describe every particle @xmath39 as being at the center of a sphere of radius @xmath40 inside a magnetic continuum such that each particle feels the `` external '' field @xmath47 and explicit dipolar fields @xmath77 ( [ hdipnear ] ) from the particles whose distance is smaller than @xmath40 .    the aforementioned statistical mechanical problems with the long range nature of the bare dipolar interactions is thus circumvented by the cutoff at @xmath40 in ( [ vijconti ] ) that results from decomposing dipolar fields into a near and a far contribution .",
    "dipolar forces appear explicitly only as forces with a finite range .",
    "their influence on the magnetization in our approach is therefore independent of the geometry of the probe .",
    "the geometry dependence enters only via the effective `` external '' field @xmath78 from the far field contribution .",
    "since an integral such as ( [ candistrigen ] ) is hard to solve even numerically we use the born  mayer expansion method @xcite to get analytical results .",
    "the key point of this method is to write @xmath79 where @xmath80 if the typical interaction energy is small compared to @xmath6 , the @xmath81 can be considered as small parameters , and @xmath82 can be expanded into a series : @xmath83 these integrals can be factorized and are therefore easier to handle .    the first order of ( [ generalbmexp ] ) contains terms like @xmath84 here @xmath85 is an abbreviation for @xmath86 , and @xmath87 means the integration over the possible orientations of @xmath69 .",
    "obviously even the first order still can not be evaluated analytically .",
    "therefore a second series expansion is made    @xmath89    @xmath90    so we expand @xmath81 in powers of the reduced dipolar interaction @xmath91 .",
    "the integrals in ( [ generalbmexp ] ) that remain to be solved are of the form @xmath92    we now introduce a modification of the common graphical representation of born  mayer integrals as follows    1 .   every distinct particle that appears via interaction terms of the form @xmath93",
    "is represented by a circle .",
    "2 .   a zeroth order interaction term @xmath94 is represented by an overlap of the circles @xmath39 and @xmath95 .",
    "first , second , ... order interaction is represented by one , two , ... lines connecting the circles .",
    "note that the representation of the zeroth order dipolar interaction by two overlapping circles is a reminder that in this case the integrand is nonzero only if the particles are assumed to be in a configuration in which they would indeed overlap .",
    "it turns out , that the expansion in terms of the @xmath93 means an expansion in powers of the two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 , that define the thermodynamical system .",
    "every line in a representing graph , i.  e. , every power of @xmath91 results in a factor @xmath5 .",
    "every @xmath96particle subgraph in which all circles are connected to each other directly or indirectly gives a factor of @xmath97 . in the next two sections we will present two expansions considering different terms",
    "in this section only terms up to @xmath98 will be taken into account .      in @xmath98",
    "the canonical partition function reads @xmath99 the @xmath81 have yet to be expanded in powers of @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ clusterexp1 ] shows the corresponding graphs .",
    "there are @xmath101 ways to choose @xmath39 and @xmath95 . because all particles are identical one can write @xmath102 integrating over most degrees of freedom results in @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the partition function of a paramagnetic gas of noninteracting particles in the field @xmath78 defining the langevin parameter @xmath105      now we expand @xmath106 appearing in ( [ zinexp1 ] ) in a power series in @xmath5 . the @xmath96th summand of this series contains integrals of the form @xmath107 @xmath108 is special . here",
    "one gets @xmath109 the integrand vanishes if @xmath110 .",
    "otherwise its value is @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath112 or by expressing the result in terms of @xmath4 @xmath113 for @xmath114 we have @xmath115 switching from @xmath116 to the relative coordinate @xmath117 and integrating over @xmath118 gives a factor of @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath117 runs over the sphere volume .",
    "we introduce spherical coordinates , i.  e. , @xmath120 the direction of the magnetic field defines the @xmath121axis .",
    "then , the integral assumes the form @xmath122 the new spherical angle @xmath123 represents @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the exact form of the function @xmath126 is not important , but @xmath126 and therefore @xmath127 is a polynomial in the @xmath128 and @xmath129 of the six angles .",
    "integration over four of them can be done analytically . finally this can also be done for @xmath130 and @xmath131 by substituting @xmath132 .",
    "one gets an expression of the form @xmath133 here we have introduced the correct bounds of the last remaining integral explicitly . by setting the lower bound to @xmath2 we have incorporated the hard core factor .",
    "the upper bound is given by the cutoff radius @xmath40 for the near - field dipolar contribution . while the evaluation of @xmath134 can be done analytically , it is quite difficult to do this by hand even for @xmath135 .",
    "we therefore used the computer algebra system _ mathematica _ to perform the integrations .",
    "see appendix [ appa ] for the form of the @xmath134 .    for @xmath136 one can safely set @xmath137 ( see below ) . for @xmath138 this would result in a logarithmic divergence of the integral .",
    "but @xmath139 anyway , because the calculation of @xmath140 involves an averaging over a dipolar field .",
    "so by using @xmath5 and @xmath4 one finally has @xmath141 @xmath142 note that @xmath143 vanishes only in our spherical configuration with finite @xmath40 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath143 in the general , spatially unrestricted case is just an expression of fact that the dipolar forces are long range . by treating the distant parts of the ferrofluid as a continuum we incorporate any long - range effects and the resulting geometry dependence via the field @xmath144 . into this field",
    "enters the relation between the external and the macroscopic internal field .",
    "two further comments should be made here .",
    "a generalization of our calculation for central symmetric interactions other than a hard sphere potential is possible .",
    "it requires an analytical or numerical evaluation of integrals of the form @xmath145 in ( [ lastintegral ] ) , with @xmath146 and @xmath147 denoting the @xmath148dependent short range potential in question .",
    "the second thing is that we can now make quantitative statements about how large the virtual sphere has to be chosen . to ensure @xmath143 to vanish unambigously in ( [ lastintegral ] ) and to introduce @xmath78 instead of @xmath149 as `` external '' field @xmath40 has only to be finite .",
    "the larger @xmath40 the better is the modeling of large  distance particle correlations entering into @xmath150 for @xmath151 . taking the limit @xmath152 as the final step in the calculation of the @xmath150 is therefore appropriate from this point of view . on the other hand ,",
    "the requirement of uniformity of the fields @xmath12 and @xmath15 , that allows us to write @xmath144 restricts @xmath40 to values below the scale on which @xmath1 and @xmath0 vary .",
    "if one would use a finite radius @xmath40 one would get instead of ( [ aninf ] ) for @xmath136 @xmath153   \\label{anwithrs}\\ ] ] which allows an error estimate : consider a system where @xmath15 and @xmath12 do not vary on the scale of , say , @xmath154 m . for ferrofluids , @xmath155 nm . choosing @xmath156 or @xmath157 is then both allowed and implies a difference in @xmath158 of about 0.1 percent . the result for @xmath159 is better than for @xmath156 , because in the latter case particles in a distance range between 100 nm and 1 @xmath154 m are treated in the continuum approximation and not correctly .",
    "but the error that is made by treating the ferrofluid as a continuum already beyond @xmath156 is only about 0.1 percent .",
    "we can safely assume that the macroscopic , magnetic properties do not vary on this scale .",
    "thus 100 nm is an appropriate medium scale on which both requirements hold : the continuum approximation works well beyond this cutoff radius _ and _ the macroscopic fields @xmath12 and @xmath15 should be constant on this scale . except for the calculation of @xmath143 , it is then possible to set @xmath137 in the calculations of the integrals .    using the results ( [ aninf ] ) , ( [ a1result ] ) , ( [ a0result ] ) , and ( [ adef ] ) in ( [ zinexp1 ] ) , one gets the following expression for @xmath82 : @xmath160    + o(\\phi^2 ) \\label{zinophi } \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] here we introduced the functions @xmath161 some of which",

    "( [ mimplicit ] )  in the absence of any dipolar interactions in the system one would have @xmath181 leading to ideal paramagnetism .      the onsager model , the weiss model , and our calculation agree that up to order @xmath182 @xmath183 this expression was also derived by buyevich and ivanov @xcite with a calculation similar to ours .",
    "however , they did not introduce a magnetic continuum approximation .",
    "instead , they assumed a special probe geometry of a long cylinder parallel to the external magnetic field and performed an integration over all the particle s dipolar fields in the cylinder explicitly .",
    "the magnetization was therefore given in terms of the external field .",
    "their result agrees with ours because for the cylindrical geometry chosen in @xcite @xmath11 equals @xmath12 .    a second paper that deals with our problem in a similar way was published by kalikmanov @xcite . in section 4",

    "it is possible to calculate @xmath187terms of the born  mayer expansion when @xmath5 is taken into account up to second order only . a more elegant way to calculate the magnetization in this approximation makes use of the grand canonical rather than the canonical ensemble .",
    "this approach allows to avoid the determination of some terms that can be factorized into already known integrals and cancel out in the calculation of the free energy .",

    "some more algebra is then required to find out the function @xmath188 . here",
    "we continue to work with the canonical ensemble .",

    "we investigated the ratios @xmath260 and @xmath261 the first ratio assumes its maximum at @xmath262 , that means the initial susceptibility is most sensitive to higher order corrections in @xmath5 . the second ratio ( [ phi2error ] ) assumes its maximum around @xmath263 , that is near the maximum of the absolute value of the numerator ( as seen in figure [ ophi2 ] ) .    in the @xmath5@xmath4 plane of figure [ errors](a )",

    "we do not present a comparison of our results with the experiments on the magnetization in the literature because of several problems : in our theory it is necessary to distinguish between the particle diameter @xmath2 and the magnetic core diameter @xmath10 that is found in magneto  granulometric measurements .",

    "also , corrections such as the temperature dependence of the saturation magnetization or the fluid density should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "but the major problem in comparing directly with experiments is that our theory does not take into account the polydispersity of ferrofluids .",
    "the effect of polydispersity is significant already in the absence of any dipolar interaction .",
