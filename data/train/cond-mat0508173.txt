    "quantum mechanical scattering in systems with complex internal dynamics has been a subject of intensive research activity for a number of years .",
    "this interest was motivated by various areas of physics , ranging from nuclear @xcite , atomic @xcite and molecular @xcite physics , to mesoscopics @xcite , quantum chaos @xcite , and classical wave scattering @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in this subject was renewed due to technological developments in quantum optics associated with the construction of new type of lasers @xcite and experimental investigation of atoms in optical lattices @xcite .    the most fundamental object characterizing",
    "the process of quantum scattering is the unitary @xmath0 -matrix relating the amplitudes of incoming waves to the amplitudes of outgoing waves .",
    "the recent advances in mesoscopic physics and quantum chaos , led to a fast development of powerful theoretical techniques which allow us to understand the statistical properties of the @xmath1matrix . at present",
    ", there are two complementary theoretical tools employed to calculate statistical properties of the @xmath1matrix , namely the semiclassical and the stochastic approach .",
    "the starting point of the first is a representation of the @xmath1 matrix elements in terms of a sum of classical orbits @xcite while the latter exploits the similarity with ensembles of random matrices @xcite . at the same time , recent experimental progress allowed a direct comparison of the theoretical predictions with actual experimental results .",
    "microwave experiments ( see @xcite and references therein ) offer a unique possibility to check even details of the existing theories in cases , where this is hardly possible by other methods while they raise new challenging questions ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the study of the distribution of the @xmath1matrix elements , resonance widths and wigner delay times distributions gained also a lot of attention .",
    "the latter quantity captures the time- dependent aspects of quantum scattering .",
    "it can be interpreted as the typical time an almost monochromatic wave packet remains in the interaction region .",
    "resonances are defined as poles of the @xmath0-matrix occurring at complex energies @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the position and @xmath4 the width of the resonance .",
    "they correspond to `` eigenstates '' of the open system that decay in time due to the coupling to the `` outside world '' and they are related to conductance fluctuations and current relaxation @xcite . for chaotic / ballistic systems random matrix theory ( rmt ) is applicable , and the distributions of resonance widths @xmath5 and wigner delay times @xmath6 are known .",
    "a review of the rmt results can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this contributions",
    "we aim in giving an overview of the recent developments in scattering from open samples in conditions where rmt is not applicable and deviations from `` universality '' due to the appearance of localization is apparent .",
    "although our presentation is focus on random media , one has to keep always in mind that these results valid also for dynamical systems with chaotic classical limit . despite the fact that these systems are deterministic ( in contrast to random media where randomness is `` builded '' up with the system ) localization occurs due to complicated interference effects created by the underlying classical chaotic dynamics and for this reason is termed _ dynamical localization",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the observables that will be in the focus of our presentation are the distributions of resonance widths and delay times .",
    "we consider various spatial geometries and models whose closed analogs show features such as diffusion , criticality or localization . a short overview of localization theory and the definitions of the various regimes is given in section [ sec : loctheory ] . in the next section [ sec : models ]",
    "we present the mathematical formalism associated with the scattering process , and define the quantities of interest . in section [ sec : resonance ]",
    "we review the consequences of localization in the resonance width distribution .",
    "the corresponding results for the delay times are analyzed in [ sec : delay ] .",
    "finally in section [ sec : quasi ] we present some results for quasi - periodic systems at criticality .",
    "our conclusions are given at the last section [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "localization of waves has always been among the most difficult yet most fascinating topics in the study of wave propagation in disordered media .",
    "the first studies dealt with infinite media , showing that localization is always achieved in one and two dimensions but that a minimum amount of disorder is required in dimensions larger than two @xcite .",
    "its main feature is that the eigenfunctions of a disordered medium in the localized regime , are characterized by an exponential decay in space i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the localization length .",
    "a direct consequence is that transmission is inhibited and the system behaves as an insulator .",
    "the fingerprints of localization in various quantities associated with the closed systems have been identified and quite well understood .",
    "detailed numerical and theoretical studies gave a clear picture how the statistical properties of these quantities change as the disorder strength increase ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for weak disorder , such that the mean free path @xmath9 is larger than any physical length scale , the system is in the _",
    "ballistic regime_. an equivalent definition of this regime is given through the condition @xmath10 .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath11 is known as the thouless conductance , @xmath12 is the mean level spacing and @xmath13 is the co - called thouless energy .",
    "the latter plays a prominent role in the theory of random media , and is inverse proportional to the time needed for an excitation to propagate through the entire sample . in this regime",
    "the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) were shown to describe accurately the statistical properties of various observables .",
    "for example , the eigenstates are extended all over the system , the eigenvalue spacing distribution follow with a good accuracy the famous wigner surmise @xcite etc .",
    "as the disorder increases the system becomes _",
    "diffusive_. this regime is characterized by the condition that the system size @xmath14 is larger than the mean free path @xmath9 but still smaller than the localization length @xmath8 i.e. @xmath15 . using the powerful sigma - model approach",
    "it was explained how the deviations from the rmt results raise @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical experiments @xcite verified the theoretical predictions .",
    "these deviations are specifically strong at the far `` tails '' of the distribution of the eigenfunction intensities as well as of some related quantities and are signatures of the underlying classical diffusive dynamics @xcite .",
    "they were shown to be related with anomalously localized states termed _ pre - localized _ states .",
    "in @xcite it was found that pre - localized states are also present in quantum systems with deterministic chaotic dynamics .",
    "as far as the spectral correlations are concerned it has been shown that there are large deviations above the thouless energy @xmath16 where @xmath17 is time to diffuse through the system with diffusion constant @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the thouless conductance @xmath11 is related with the latter as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "rapid development in microwave techniques allowed for a direct observation of some of these predictions , in microwave experiments @xcite .",
    "the deviations of the level and eigenfunction statistics from their rmt form , strengthen with increasing disorder and become especially pronounced at the _ localization _ regime . in this regime ,",
    "inhibition of wave diffusion due to interference of multiple scattering waves take place @xcite .",
    "the resulting scenario depends strongly on the dimensionality of the sample and the disorder strength .",
    "it turns out that the eigenstates are exponentially localized in low dimensional systems even for arbitrary weak disorder . as a matter of fact",
    "the localization regime is defined through the condition that @xmath21 .",
    "one of the consequences following from this fact is the prediction that the conductance of a sample goes exponentially to zero with increasing its length and the sample behaves as an insulator .",
    "in contrast , disordered single - particle systems in more than two - dimensions exhibits a reacher behavior .",
    "if the disorder is weak enough there is no localization and the system has a metallic behavior while for strong disorder strength we recover the localization regime .",
    "the transition point from a metallic to localized behavior is of special interest and is called metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .    the mit where the phase transition from localized to extended states occurs , is characterized by remarkably rich critical properties . in particular , the level statistics acquires a scale - independent form with distinct critical features @xcite while the eigenfunctions show strong fluctuations on all length scales and represent multi - fractal distributions @xcite . as a matter of fact , a connection between multi - fractality and statistical properties of eigenvalues at mit has been recently established @xcite .",
    "the multi - fractal structure of the eigenfunctions is usually quantified by studying the size dependence of the so - called participation numbers ( pn ) @xmath22 where @xmath14 is the linear size of the system and @xmath23 are the multi - fractal dimensions of the eigenfunction @xmath24 . among all the dimensions , the correlation dimension @xmath25 plays the most prominent role .",
    "the corresponding pn is roughly equal to the number of non - zero eigenfunction components , and therefore is a good and widely accepted measure of the extension of the states . at the same time , @xmath25 manifest itself in a variety of other physical observables .",
    "as examples we mention the statistical properties of the spectrum @xcite , and the anomalous spreading of a wave - packet , and the spatial dispersion of the diffusion coefficient @xcite .    at the same time",
    "a considerable effort was made to understand the shape of the conductance distribution @xmath26 at mit @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether the limiting @xmath26 is entirely universal , i.e. dependent only on the dimensionality and symmetry class , as required by the one - parameter scaling theory of localization @xcite .",
    "the latter is one of the major achievements in the long history of studying the mit .",
    "its basic assumption is that close to the mit the change of the conductance @xmath11 with the sample size @xmath14 depends only on the conductance itself , and not separately on energy , disorder , size and shape of the sample , the mean free path etc .",
    "although a lot of studies have been devoted to the analysis of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and of conductance , the properties of resonances , and delay times were left unexplored until recently .",
    "nevertheless it was clear from the very beginning that their statistical properties depend strongly on the nature of the states of the finite system `` in isolation '' .",
    "thus anderson localization must leave its fingerprints in these quantities which after all reflect the `` leakage '' of the waves to the leads , through the sample boundaries . in the next sections we will review the outcome of these studies and their deviations from the rmt predictions due to non - universal features .",
    "the scattering @xmath1matrix relates the outgoing wave amplitudes to the incoming wave amplitudes . assuming @xmath27 open channels",
    ", one can show that the @xmath28 scattering matrix can be written in the form @xcite @xmath29 here , @xmath30 stands for an @xmath31dimensional self - adjoint hamiltonian describing the closed counterpart of the system under consideration , @xmath32 stands for the energy of the incoming waves , and @xmath33 is an @xmath34 operator that contains matrix elements coupling the internal motion to one of the open @xmath27 channels . in principle , the matrix elements of the operator @xmath33 depends on energy .",
    "however , since this dependence is very weak ( far away from channel thresholds ) , we can ignore it and consider @xmath35 to be energy - independent .",
    "@xmath36 is the @xmath28 unit matrix . for a detail derivation of the scattering matrix for the case of a tight - binding model see @xcite while for a chaotic cavity see @xcite .",
    "it is easy to verify that form ( [ smatrix ] ) ensures the unitarity of the scattering matrix i.e. @xmath37 , provided the energy @xmath32 takes only real values .",
    "when one allows the energy parameter to have a nonzero imaginary part , the @xmath1matrix unitarity is immediately lost . having @xmath38 correspond to the physical situation of uniform dumping inside the system @xcite and it is responsible for the losses of the outgoing flux of the particles as compared to the incoming flux .",
    "the `` dual '' case @xmath39 correspond to uniform amplification .",
    "the balance between the two fluxes is precisely the physical mechanism behind the @xmath1matrix unitarity .",
    "the poles of the scattering matrix @xmath0 are associated with the formation of resonance states .",
    "they represent long - lived intermediate states to which bound states of a closed system are converted due to coupling to continua . due to causality ,",
    "they are located in the lower half plane i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the position and the width of the resonances , respectively .",
    "they are solutions of the following secular equation @xmath40 where the resonance width @xmath41 is inverse proportional to the lifetime of the corresponding resonance state . from eqs .",
    "( [ smatrix],[poleseq ] ) it is clear that the formation of resonances is closely related to the internal dynamics inside the scattering region which is governed by @xmath30 .",
    "another quantity that will be in the focus of this contribution is the wigner delay time @xcite and its variations ( for an overview on the various definitions of delay times and their physical importance see @xcite ) .",
    "it captures the time - dependent aspects of quantum scattering .",
    "it can be interpreted as the typical time an _ almost monochromatic _ wave packet remains in the interaction region .",
    "formally the wigner delay time @xmath42 is related with the energetic derivative of the total phase of the unimodular @xmath1matrix @xmath43 where @xmath44 is called the wigner - smith time delay matrix @xcite .",
    "its eigenvalues @xmath45 , are called proper delay times , and correspond to the time the particle dwells at a particular channel @xmath46 .",
    "alternatively , one can also define the _ partial _ delay times @xmath47 as the energetic derivatives of the eigenphases @xmath48 of the unimodular @xmath1matrix i.e. @xmath49 @xcite . beyond the one - channel case ,",
    "proper and partial delay times differ , although the sum of partial / proper delay times over all @xmath27 scattering channels are always equal and yield the wigner delay time .",
    "in this section we analyze the distribution of resonances @xmath50 .",
    "the properties of resonances are of fundamental as well as technological interest",
    ". one can show that they determine the conductance fluctuations of a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite , or the current relaxation .",
    "the latter study constitute a fundamental source of physical information for systems which are coupled to a continuum via metallic leads or absorbing boundaries . while the radioactive decay is a prominent paradigm , more recent examples include atoms in optically generated lattices and billiards @xcite , the ionization of molecular rydberg states @xcite , photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitation relaxation in semiconductor quantum dots and wires @xcite , and pulse propagation studies with electromagnetic waves @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , one can approach the problem of current relaxation by evaluating the survival probability @xmath51 of a wave packet which is initially localized inside an open sample of volume @xmath52 @xmath53 the approximation above ( modal approximation ) valid @xcite for times larger that the heisenberg time and allow us to calculate a dynamical quantity such as @xmath51 , based on information about resonances .",
    "the total current leaking out of the sample is then related to the survival probability by @xmath54    the ability of constructing micro - lasers with chaotic resonators which produce high - power directional emission @xcite as much as the experimental realizations of the so - called random lasers @xcite where the feedback is due to multiple scattering within the medium ( instead of being due to mirrors ) is another reason why statistical properties of resonances became of fashion in our days . for",
    "the latter application the knowledge of resonance width distribution can result in the knowledge of the statistical properties of the lasing threshold .",
    "the lasing threshold is given by the value of the smallest decay rate ( i.e. smallest resonance width ) of all eigenmodes in the amplification window @xcite .",
    "the underlying reasoning is that in the mode with the smallest decay rate the photons are created faster by amplification than they can leave ( decay ) the sample . assuming that the number of modes @xmath55 that lies in the frequency window where the amplification is possible , have resonance widths @xmath41 that are statistically independent one gets for distribution of lasing thresholds @xmath56 @xcite : @xmath57^{k-1}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that all @xmath58 resonances are distributed according to @xmath59 .",
    "the validity of this approximation was verified recently in the framework of the rmt @xcite . an important outcome of @xcite was that one can identify in diffusive systems , traces of pre - localized states in the latter distribution and consequently in @xmath56 .",
    "this send some light to recent experimental finding for random lasers which suggests the appearance of localized modes in diffusive samples @xcite .      at the ballistic regime ,",
    "rmt modeling is applicable .",
    "its main advantage is its universality . at the same time",
    ", universality means that the rmt modeling does nt `` know '' anything about the specific properties of the system under study . since no physical parameters ( except the global symmetries )",
    "are plugged in the rmt machinery , it is clear that it can give the correct predictions only in some limiting cases , when all physical parameters and scales can be considered as irrelevant .    in the general case , fyodorov and",
    "sommers @xcite proved that the distribution of scaled resonance widths @xmath60 for the unitary random matrix ensemble , is given by @xmath61 where the parameter @xmath62 controls the degree of coupling with the channels , @xmath63 indicates an average over realizations and @xmath64 is the @xmath65function . in fig .",

    "moreover we assume that the particles are uniformly distributed inside the sample and spread ballistically until they reach the boundary , where they are absorbed .",
