    "it is well established that the universe is permeated with magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and yet the origin of them is not well understood ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the problem of cosmic magnetism can be divided into two parts - the origin of seed fields and their amplification . in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the latter .",
    "if a weak seed magnetic field is introduced into a turbulent medium , flow motions stretch field lines and amplify the field .",
    "such turbulent amplification has been studied since 1950 s ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the amplification goes through three stages : ( 1 ) eddy motions in turbulence are fastest on the smallest scale , which is the dissipation scale .",
    "therefore , the stretching of magnetic field lines occurs most actively at the dissipation scale first , and the magnetic energy grows exponentially .",
    "( 2 ) the exponential growth stage ends , when the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy at the dissipation scale . the follow - up stage is characterized by a linear growth of magnetic energy , and a gradual shift of the peak of magnetic field spectrum to larger scales .",
    "( 3 ) the amplification of magnetic field stops , when the total magnetic energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy .",
    "a final , statistically steady , saturation stage is reached .",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario in which turbulent flow motions are induced via the cascade of the vorticity generated at cosmological shocks during the formation of the large scale structure .",
    "based on a model of turbulent amplification , they estimated the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) ; @xmath11 a few @xmath12 g in clusters , @xmath13 g around clusters , and @xmath14 ng in filaments . in their model ,",
    "the intracluster medium is at a stage close to the saturation one .",
    "but the igm in filaments are still at the linear growth stage .",
    "the igmf has been observed with faraday rotation measure ( rm ) ; for instance , @xcite in clusters and @xcite outside clusters . for the igmf with @xmath15 , the mean value of rm",
    "is expected to vanish , and the standard deviation represents the observation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are in units of @xmath20 , @xmath12 g , and pc , respectively , has been used to extract the strength of the igmf .",
    "here , @xmath21 is the root - mean - square ( rms ) strength of line - of - sight magnetic field , @xmath19 is the coherence length , and @xmath22 is the path length .",
    "but the formula has been applied without a clear definition of the coherence length .    here , we study length scales of magnetic field in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence with very weak or zero mean magnetic field , intended for application to the igmf .",
    "several characteristic lengths , which have been introduced in previous works , are considered .",
    "characteristic lengths of initial seed fields in the early universe could be either very large or very small , depending on how the seed fields were generated .",
    "however , the field structure at the linear growth and saturation stages is independent of the seed fields as long as they are sufficiently weak ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the characteristic lengths should be determined by the energy injection scale ( or the outer scale ) only . and based on a scaling argument , @xcite stated that in the linear growth stage , the scale at which the stretching is most active grows as @xmath23 .    in this paper , through numerical simulations ,",
    "we investigate the growth and saturation of characteristic lengths .",
    "then , we show how the coherence length in the rm due to the igmf is defined in terms of the characteristic lengths , and present a formula for @xmath7 . and",
    "based on the model of @xcite , we estimate @xmath7 for clusters and filaments .",
    "we solved the incompressible mhd equations in a periodic box of size @xmath24 using a pseudo - spectral code .",
    "we drove turbulence in fourier space .",
    "the forcing function has the following form : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a complex vector that is perpendicular to the wavevector @xmath27 .",
    "the 22 forcing components are nearly isotropically distributed in the range @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the phase of each forcing component randomly fluctuates , but it has a correlation time of approximately unity .",
    "the amplitude of each forcing component also randomly fluctuates . on average ,",
    "each forcing component injects similar amount of energy .",
    "( 12 components ) , 3 ( 3 components ) , and @xmath30 ( 4 components ) .",
    "therefore the peak of energy injection occurs at @xmath31 , and the energy injection scale is @xmath32 .",
    "a similar discrete sampling of forcing can be found in @xcite , where they used 13 components . ] in physical space this forcing @xmath33 corresponds to statistically homogeneous driving on large scales .",
    "only the solenoidal component of the velocity field was driven .",
    "the strength of energy injection was tuned , so without magnetic field the rms velocity becomes unity , @xmath34 , at saturation . in this representation , @xmath35 can be viewed as the velocity measured in units of the rms velocity of the system .",
    "the density is unity and the magnetic field is multiplied by @xmath36 in our simulations , so @xmath37 can be viewed as the alfven speed in the same units .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and the fluctuating field : @xmath38 . at @xmath39 ,",
    "the magnetic field had either weak uniform component ( when @xmath40 ) or only random components ( when @xmath41 ; run @xmath42-@xmath43 , see below ) , and the velocity had a support between @xmath44 in the wavevector space .",

    "all the runs have either very weak or zero mean magnetic field , since we intend to apply the results to turbulence in the igm , as noted in introduction .",
