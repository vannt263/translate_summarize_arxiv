    "it is clearly an important task to derive effective four - dimensional potentials from string theory that can describe all observed phenomenological properties of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the list of phenomenological restrictions on the effective string potentials is rather long and challenging : one has to break supersymmetry in a controllable way , to explain the higgs mechanism and the standard model symmetry breaking with great detail , as well as to address cosmological observations .",
    "focusing on applications to cosmology , we can list three main tasks : moduli stabilization , the creation of an inflationary potential and finally the generation of a small and positive cosmological constant . when discussing these problems , it is desirable to focus on the universal features rather than building on very model dependent details of particulars string vacua . specifically , it is important to understand if the generic structure of the string landscape puts more severe restrictions on the form of the effective potentials compared to what comes out from gravity or supergravity in higher dimensions ( for some discussion on this general issue see  @xcite ) .",
    "an important example is the difficulty in building a string model with trans - planckian range for the inflaton field  @xcite . in light of the recent cosmological observation of large tensor perturbation in the cmb reported by the bicep2 collaboration ,",
    "if confirmed , this restriction become crucial .",
    "indeed , it is well known  @xcite that an observation of a large tensor perturbation would imply a trans - planckian excursion for the inflaton .",
    "it is then critical to understand possible ways to evade constraints on inflaton field range in the string landscape .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a class of effective potentials which originate from internal fluxes in the universal ns sector of the ten - dimensional type ii superstrings .",
    "in addition to @xmath3-fluxes , at the level of the effective theory one can add additional fluxes , such as @xmath4-fluxes ( derivatives of non - constant components in the internal metric ) and more exotic non - geometric @xmath5-fluxes , which can be viewed as derivatives of a bi - vector @xmath6 . these kind of backgrounds can be described as t - folds , or compactifications with duality twists  @xcite , which are in the simplest cases just fibrations of a two - dimensional torus @xmath7 over a one - dimensional base @xmath8 .",
    "they are characterized by the monodromy of the @xmath7-fibre when going around the @xmath8-base .",
    "the monodromy is encoded in a twist matrix @xmath9 , which determines how the t - duality group @xmath10 acts on the fibre when encircling the base .",
    "we will argue that such non - trivial monodromies allow the corresponding moduli ( the complex structure @xmath11 and the khler parameter @xmath12 of the fibre torus ) in the effective scalar potential to take values in bigger domains than the fundamental domain of @xmath13 .",
    "the role of such monodromies , as first noticed in  @xcite , has important consequences for inflation , since in principle it can allows trans - planckian field range of the inflaton ( which in  @xcite is identified with an axion ) .",
    "we note that t - duality is responsible for the non - trivial monodromies that extend the field range , while often it is precisely t - duality that makes attaining large inflaton range problematic  @xcite .",
    "the background monodromies can belong to parabolic or elliptic conjugacy classes of the duality group  @xcite ( in addition there are also hyperbolic and sporadic classes ) . in the parabolic case ,",
    "the monodromy has infinte order , and this situation allows for infinitely large field configurations . for example , the nilmanifold used in the original axion monodromy model  @xcite is a geometric space with infinitely large monodromy . applied to wrapped d4 branes this is what extends the inflaton range .",
    "the effective ns potentials from constant fluxes with parabolic monodromies have the following schematic form ( in the einstein frame ) : @xmath14 here @xmath15 denotes then internal volume modulus , @xmath16 corresponds to the dilaton field , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the potential energies created by the corresponding constant fluxes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath21 ( being quadratic in the fluxes , i.e. @xmath22 ,  ) . note that in general not all fluxes can be turned on at the same time , but only one kind of flux on a three - dimensional space can be non - vanishing .",
    "simple no - go theorems  @xcite show that these potentials do not have the desired properties for inflation , and up - lifts to stable minkowski or de sitter vacua are not possible .-",
    "function equations are only satisfied in lowest order of the fluxes .",
    "] however some ways to relax these no - go theorems via geometric as well as non - geometric fluxes were discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , other ingredients such as ns 5-branes , anti ns 5-branes and kk monopoles can be introduced to stabilize some of the moduli and provide an uplift to a de sitter vacuum  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will analyze instead elliptic flux backgrounds and their corresponding effective potentials .",
    "they provide a new class of geometric as well as non - geometric ns string backgrounds . we stress that a full understanding of truly non - geometric solutions is still lacking and quite challenging , since ten dimensional supergravity is of little use and in general one expects significant string corrections .",
    "while in some cases a worldsheet approach can be used ( see for example  @xcite ) , it would be highly desirable to have an effective description that capture some of the main features of such backgrounds .",
    "one can indeed make progress from a supergravity description in four dimension  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will make use of recent works @xcite to study ten dimensional consistency of such effective description by using dimensional reduction of double field theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "we will use the dft tools to get some controls over nongeometric compactifcations , to derive potentials in particular for elliptic backgrounds and to study their vacuum structure and their inflationary properties .",
    "the considered backgrounds are intrinsically non - geometric , since they do not lie on an orbit which is t - dual to any known geometric compactification .",
    "we will show that the associated potentials with elliptic fluxes do allow for minkowski vacua and we provide evidence that they can lead to de sitter vacua .",
    "we will also analyze the finite , elliptic monodromies in more detail .",
    "in contrast to the parabolic monodromies , they will lead to an enhanced field range not only for the axionic component of the complex modulus , but also for its imaginary part , which in particular describes the volume of the fibre torus inside the compact space .",
    "we will then demonstrate that these monodromies can be nicely used for inflation , as they in turn lead to an enhanced field range for the inflaton field .",
    "furthermore they also allow for the stabilization of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 moduli of the fibre torus .",
    "this is possible since new terms will appear in the potential  , created from the interplay between different fluxes , which will allow the uplift to minkowski or de sitter vacua",
    ".    we will also study if these elliptic potentials can be used to obtain a viable inflation , meeting some of the phenomenologycal restrictions from recent observations .",
    "we will show that we can obtain a potential which is almost quadratic in the directions of the real parts of the khler or complex structure moduli fields , thus providing a simple embedding of a chaotic inflation potential @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "we will then study if one can satisfies slow roll conditions for such potentials , and discuss about the allowed field range for the inflaton .",
    "as we will see , slow roll conditions will be possible only if one could tune the fluxes to be very small .",
    "however , a mildly enhanced field range for the inflation will be in fact possible due to elliptic monodromies of the backgrounds .",
    "we stress however that these models , being basically the products of two 3-dimensional flux backgrounds , still have to be regarded as toy models .",
    "it is plausible that by considering more general six - dimensional spaces , it is possible to obtain different flux combinations that can naturally solve the slow roll conditions , thus giving more realistic cosmological models . +",
    "* note added*. after this paper appeared online , it was found that the observation of large tensor - to - scalar ratio from the bicep2 collaboration is due to a previously overlooked dust contribution .",
    "this reduces the need of large trans - planckian field ranges for the inflaton and fit nicely with our elliptic models , which favour mild field range enhancements .",
    "in this section we will consider a very simple model of t - fold backgrounds , closely related to asymmetric orbifolds  @xcite , which illustrates some of the properties that we discussed before .",
    "recently , this kind of backgrounds have also been studied from the point of view of consistent dimensional reduction of double field theory  @xcite , a fact that makes the study of our toy model more tractable .",
    "these spaces are non - geometric generalizations of nilmanifolds ( aka twisted tori ) , where geometric as well as non - geometric ns fluxes can coexist at the same time .",
    "furthermore these backgrounds have the property that they are in general not t - dual to any geometric space .",
    "starting from the dft action and performing a generalized scherk - schwarz reduction , the corresponding background solutions are characterized by the requirement of the vanishing of the generalized dft ricci tensor . for simplicity",
    ", we will only consider the case of three compact dimensions , in which there are only two distinct solutions of these dft field equations , called single elliptic and double elliptic cases .",
    "the double geometries in the internal directions of both cases correspond to fibrations where the doubled fiber is a four - dimensional torus @xmath24 over a doubled circle as a base .",
    "the double elliptic case is not t - dual to a geometric description and it exhibits @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5-flux at the same time and it is thus a truly non - geometric space ( it can not be written in terms of a globally well defined metric , @xmath25-field and dilaton ) .",
    "we remark that in order to be able to consider such spaces , one need a mild violation of the strong constraint of dft . indeed , the killing vectors do not satisfy the constraint and",
    "can depend both on the coordinates and the windings @xcite .",
    "in the effective lower - dimensional theory these solutions lead to minkowski vacua with vanishing ground state energy . after performing the dimensional reduction ,",
    "the effective action is described by a particular gauged supergravity potential , which is a function of the scalar field moduli of the ( doubled ) fibre torus , and whose discrete parameters are the @xmath3- , @xmath4- and @xmath5-fluxes of the dft action .",
    "the scalar potentials we obtain in this way exhibit several interesting and new features , which make them also potentially interesting for cosmology and in particular for inflation .",
    "since they come from a consistent scherk - schwarz ansatz , the corresponding effective potentials are positive semidefinite with zero or positive energy minima in the moduli directions .",
    "in fact , the vanishing or , respectively , the positivity of the potential energy at the minimum of the potential is due to the contributions of geometric and non - geometric fluxes that precisely cancel each other , so that no extra uplifting terms , such as orientifolds and/or anti ns5-branes , are needed in order to obtain a zero cosmological constant .",
    "this leads to hope that the interplay among different kind of fluxes can evade the ( in)famous no - go theorems about inflation and de sitter vacua in flux compactifications .",
    "we will now present the potentials obtained with the methods of  @xcite and study their minima , as well as the monodromies of the backgrounds . in the following section",
    ", we will examine inflationary properties of such effective potentials .",
    "let us briefly review the main properties of the non - geometric backgrounds obtained in  @xcite . in general , we are considering three - dimensional spaces with non - vanishing @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath21 fluxes - flux . in any case",
    "we will shortly set @xmath26 . ] .",
    "they are solutions in a doubled space in which are topologically given as fibrations of a doubled torus over a doubled circle .",
    "the fibration is elliptic and of finite order ( in contrast to parabolic fibrations , as e.g. the torus with constant h - flux and its t - dual versions , such as nilmanifolds ) .",
    "different fibrations can be specified by so - called twist matrices ( for details see  @xcite ) , which are certain elements forming a @xmath27 subgroup of the modular group @xmath13 . for consistency",
    ", the monodromies of these 3-dimensional backgrounds can be only of the following finite orders : like @xmath28 are possible . ]",
    "@xmath29 alternatively , these backgrounds can also be described in terms of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 fluxes . in dft , all these fluxes are combined into a single , totally antisymmetric object ( called covariant fluxes  @xcite ) : @xmath30    a generalized scherk - schwarz compactification of dft  @xcite gives rise to the scalar potential @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the generalized metric of a @xmath33 . keeping in mind the fiber structure explained above , we parameterized this torus with five moduli : the complex structure @xmath34 , the khler parameter @xmath35 of the @xmath7 fibre and the radius @xmath21 of the base .",
    "this parameterization gives rise to @xmath36 in the following we will deal with four flux parameters : @xmath37 then one obtains the following scalar potential in the moduli @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath21 .. ] it reads @xmath38\\ , , \\ ] ] the base radius r is a flat direction of the potential and in the following we will set it to 1 . the potential exhibits a different structure than the potential in eq.([eq : pot ] ) , since there are cross - terms that are proportional to the product of two different fluxes , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "these new terms that arise only for the elliptic backgrounds will be responsible for allowing stable minkowski or de sitter vacua .    in dft",
    "the fluxes can not be arbitrarily chosen , but they are restricted by the strong constraint in the following way : @xmath41 requiring furthermore a minkowski vacuum in the effective seven - dimensional theory , the dft equations of motion plus the constraint   give rise to @xmath42 as discussed in details in  @xcite , there are only three kind of solutions :    * @xmath43 , @xmath44 . this is a geometric background , analogous to a symmetric @xmath45 orbifold  @xcite , constructed as a fibered torus with an elliptic monodromy . *",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "this is a non - geometric t - fold , obtained by a t - duality from the solution ( i ) and correspond to an asymmetric @xmath48 orbifold .",
    "it has an elliptic monodromy in the khler parameter . *",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath47 .",
    "this is a non - geometric background that does not belong to any t - dual orbit of a geometric space and corresponds to an asymmetric @xmath45 orbifold . in the double field theory formulation ,",
    "two coordinate charts are patched with diffeomorphisms , b- and @xmath6-transformations at the same time @xcite .",
    "while the strong constraint for the fluxes is satisfied , we stress that the killing vectors violate this constraint and they have dependence on both the coordinates and momenta .",
    "these spaces have two elliptic monodromies in both complex and khler structure .    for a fibration which corresponds to an order @xmath49 twist , the fluxes @xmath50 have to be quantized in units of @xmath51 .",
    "this is summarized in table [ tab : quantizedfluxes ] .",
    ".quantized values for the fluxes ( in flat indices ) and the corresponding parameter of the vacuum generalized vielbein @xmath52 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     assuming the strong constraint in dft to hold , only the cases 1 , 3 and 6 survive :    * case 1 is a @xmath53 with @xmath3-flux and has so(4 ) as gauge group .",
    "the scalar potential of this background has an ads minimum .",
    "* case 3 has so(2,2 ) as gauge group and a ds minimum in its potential .",
    "* case 6 corresponds to the single / double elliptic cases discussed in this paper .",
    "in order to evaluate in section [ sec : potential ] , one has to connect the covariant fluxes in flat indices with the one in curved ones .",
    "this is done by the so called vacuum generalized vielbein @xmath52 which is given in term of @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath56 it acts on the covariant fluxes with flat indices as @xmath57 informations about the correct vacuum generalized vielbein can not be obtained from dft since all @xmath58 valued vacuum vielbeins give rise to the same results .",
    "nevertheless one can use additional informations from string theory . there",
