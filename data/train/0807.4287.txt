    "physics of the early universe keeps proving to be an invaluable tool for probing particle physics models and , in particular , models of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the most important viability checks of these models results from the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , i.e. , from the early universe at temperatures of @xmath3  mev . the combination of standard model physics , general relativity , and the experimental determination of the baryon - to - photon ratio from the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite forms the framework for the standard bbn ( sbbn ) which makes firm predictions for the primordial abundances of light elements such as deuterium , helium , and lithium .",
    "the comparison of sbbn predictions with observationally determined primordial fractions of these elements provides an important consistency check of standard cosmology and serves as a remarkably powerful discriminator among models of new physics  @xcite .",
    "the three most generic ways in which new physics can affect the outcome of bbn are the change in the timing of the reactions caused , _ e.g. _ , by new significant contributions to the hubble expansion rate  @xcite , the non - thermal processes from late annihilation and decays of heavy particles  @xcite , and the thermal catalysis of nuclear reactions caused by electromagnetically or strongly interacting relics  @xcite .    catalyzed big bang nucleosynthesis ( cbbn )",
    "was already discussed almost twenty years ago in ref .",
    "however , only in the last two years after the appearance of ref .",
    "@xcite , a lot of work has been done  @xcite in order to refine various aspects of catalysis and to understand the implications of cbbn in the framework of specific models .",
    "the significant interest in cbbn is also fuelled by its direct connection with collider physics .",
    "indeed , the relics causing catalysis could be directly produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) because of their electromagnetic and/or strong interactions .",
    "one of the most interesting and perhaps one of the most natural frameworks is in this context the supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model .",
    "there a spectrum with the gravitino @xmath4 as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and a charged scalar lepton @xmath5such as the lighter stau @xmath6as the next - to - lightest ( nlsp ) is a commonplace occurence even if one adopts restrictive assumptions on the soft susy breaking sector  @xcite .",
    "while the gravitino lsp is a promising candidate for dark matter  @xcite , the charged slepton nlsp can be long - lived and thus lead to cbbn  @xcite .",
    "if such a scenario is realized in nature , each standard model superpartner produced at the lhc will cascade down to the long - lived @xmath5 nlsp . as the lightest standard model superpartner",
    ", the @xmath5 nlsp will then appear as a quasi - stable muon - like particle that can escape the collider detector before decaying into the gravitino ; cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "thus , one would find signatures that are very different from the excess in missing energy expected in the alternative neutralino lsp scenarios .",
    "the most dramatic catalytic enhancement is seen in the  and  production triggered by the formation of bound states of with a ( generic ) negatively charged relic that we call .",
    "the catalytic path to  and  is shown by the following sequence of transformations  @xcite : @xmath7 although the ( ) system has a binding energy of about 350  kev , its formation is delayed until @xmath8  kev by an overwhelmingly large number of energetic photons that photo - dissociate ( ) .",
    "thus , the ( ) bound state serves essentially as a `` bottleneck '' for  production , whereas the path to  goes through the `` double bottleneck '' of ( ) and ( ) . the key for the nuclear catalysis is an enormous enhancement of the reaction rates in the photonless recoil reactions mediated by  @xcite : @xmath9 indeed , since the rates of these catalyzed reactions exceed the sbbn rates for the production of  and  by many orders of magnitude , one finds a strong sensitivity of the efficiency of the primordial  and  production to the abundance of  at relevant times . for the case of  being a thermal relic ,",
    "this abundance is governed by the  annihilation rate and by the  lifetime @xmath10 . in turn",
    ", observationally inferred limits on the primordial abundances of both  and  will impose significant constraints on the lifetime of , its mass , and its interactions .",
    "the limits on the lifetime and the abundance are particularly interesting in view of the possible catalytic solution to the so - called  problem @xcite , which is a persistent discrepancy between the predicted primordial amount of  and a factor of 23 lower observations of  in the atmospheres of the metal - poor stars .",
    "for the gravitino lsp scenarios in which  is identified with a negatively charged slepton nlsp , @xmath11 , the constraints imposed by primordial  catalysis have already been analyzed in detail in a number of publications  @xcite . assuming a standard cosmological history that leads to a typical thermal @xmath5 relic abundance , the bound from  catalysis translates into an upper limit on the @xmath5 lifetime of @xmath12  @xcite . in collider - accessible regions of the parameter space ,",
    "this limit is found to be considerably more restrictive than the bbn constraints associated with electromagnetic / hadronic energy release from @xmath5 decays  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 limit implies a gravitino mass @xmath14 well below 10% of the slepton nlsp mass @xmath15 for @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this seems to exclude a kinematical determination of @xmath14  @xcite at the next generation of particle accelerators , which might have been feasible for @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the @xmath13 limit puts a big question mark over an idea of a collider test of supergravity via the microscopic determination of the planck scale  @xcite , as well as the @xmath14-dependent collider test of thermal leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "moreover , a post - inflationary reheating temperature above @xmath18 and thereby even the viability of thermal leptogenesis with hierarchical right - handed heavy majorana neutrinos seems to be disfavored by the  constraint within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) for a standard cosmological history  @xcite . in the cmssm ,",
    "the splitting between @xmath19 and @xmath14 required to evade the @xmath20 limit translates also into a lower limit on the gaugino mass parameter , which is assumed to take on a universal value @xmath21 at the scale of grand unification .",
    "indeed , for the natural gravitino lsp mass range in gravity - mediated susy breaking scenarios , the cosmologically favored region can be associated with a mass range of the colored superparticles ( _ e.g. _ , a gluino mass of @xmath22 ) for which it will be very difficult to probe susy at the lhc  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the constraints imposed on susy models by the catalysis of a primordial  abundance . while  based on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite  we do not expect the constraints from  to be considerably tighter than those from , this analysis is warranted for a number of reasons :    1 .",
    "observations of  are extremely difficult because its lines are not resolved spectroscopically with respect to the lines of .",
    "the claim of a ``  plateau '' with metallicity @xcite at @xmath23 of the  abundance is being challenged in the recent paper  @xcite , and a new re - analysis of  data is warranted as some of the observations may turn out to provide only upper limits .",
    "in fact , even the value of an upper limit on the primoridal  abundance is subject to discussions : many papers adopt upper limits on primordial @xmath24 within a range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . unlike ,  is firmly detected in a significant number of stars at low metallicity , and its observational status is not in doubt . for the latest data on the  abundance in metal - poor stars ,",
    "see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "2 .   is more fragile than  and would burn more efficiently at lower temperatures .",
    "therefore , if there is a ( yet unconfirmed ) stellar mechanism ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) that resolves the lithium problem , i.e. , that depletes  by a factor of two or three ,  would have been depleted by an even larger factor .",
    "such a stellar mechanism , however , would affect less than either  or  since both  and  are more fragile than , which thereby provides a more robust bound on new physics .",
    "the nuclear physics rates that enter in the calculation of catalysis are dominated by resonances . given the wealth of experimental information on the  resonances @xcite , this may eventually allow for very reliable calculations of the catalytic rates .",
    "while stating strong bounds on primordial abundances / lifetimes of , a lingering question remains : is there an `` island '' of allowed lifetimes around @xmath27 ?",
    "one point emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite is that bound states of  with protons , , may have a significant impact on the primordial abundances of elements such as , ,  ( and ) .",
    "another point is related to  decays with very energetic decay products and the associated possibility of an environment in which  may be destroyed efficiently .",
    "the second point has already been addressed  @xcite , and it has been found that late energy injection can not suppress  down to an acceptable level if it is significantly overproduced at 8  kev  @xcite despite its importance , the issue of possible ( @xmath28 ) catalysis remained largely unresolved .",
    "while the importance of charge exchange reactions of  with  that may reduce the abundance of ( @xmath28 ) was already mentioned in the early paper  @xcite , subsequent publications either ignored this issue  @xcite or generally underestimated the impact of charge exchange reactions  @xcite . recognizing its importance for the whole cbbn paradigm , we revisit the catalysis by ( @xmath28 ) bound states .",
    "indeed , in this paper , we put this issue to rest by reaching the conclusion that less than 10% of  and  synthesized at 8 kev could possibly be affected by  catalysis , whereas typically suppression factors in excess of 100 are needed in order to evade the corresponding limits .",
    "this clarifies that the islands in the parameter region with large abundances / large lifetimes , which were suggested to remain viable in ref .",
    "@xcite , can not exist .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "this tells us that at most 3% of the  synthesized at 8 kev could potentially be affected by  states via process b , and therefore the whole issue of nuclear uncertainties is irrelevant given the strength of the charge exchange reactions .",
    "even though we find that process b makes no impact on , it is still interesting to examine whether ( [ maximal ] ) corresponds to a realistic rate . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , for reaction b to occur , the proton has to tunnel to the left through a distance of at least 100  fm inside the coulomb barrier of  in order to trigger its decay to two helium nuclei .",

    "effectively , this is the same distance for tunneling that a _ free _ @xmath100 energy proton would have to overcome in a @xmath101 reaction .",
    "therefore , one expects an exponential suppression of the corresponding probability by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the gamow energy . at the same time , the deconfining rate is 100% as long as the impact parameter is less or equal to @xmath61 , leading to the inevitable conclusion that the rate of the charge exchange reaction  a greatly exceeds that of the nuclear process  b , @xmath104 returning to the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite that gives a very large estimate for process b , we believe that this estimate is probably an artefact of assuming a `` frozen '' profile for the proton wave function . in contrast , in the correct approach , the proton wave function is easily polarized and deconfined by the incoming heavier nucleus .",
    "further doubts in the validity of the estimates in  @xcite are cast by the answer for the cross section at extremely small energies .",
    "for example , it follows from  @xcite that @xmath105 has almost an atomic size cross section , whereas this is a nuclear reaction between objects of nuclear size .",
    "the key difference between our treatment of induced catalysis and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is the significant underestimation of the strength of the charge exchange reactions in the latter work , which in turn leads to overestimates in expressions analogous to our eqs .",

    "a successive chain of charge exchange reactions can lead to molecular states that are finally destroyed in nuclear reactions with protons : @xmath106 in the last step of this chain , @xmath107 `` ammonium '' has a chance for a nuclear interaction with protons or helium unsuppressed by a residual coulomb barrier since @xmath107 is a very compact object . a similar chain exists for  and where the sequence of the charge exchange reactions can proceed until be@xmath51 `` methane , '' @xmath108 .",
    "it is important to note that the efficiency of this chain reaction depends very sensitively on the concentration of the  bound states and on the mass of the particle .",
    "the latter enters through the average relative velocity of two heavy objects , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which in turn scales as @xmath111 .",

    "neither lithium nor beryllium synthesized in cbbn processes at @xmath120 would be affected in any significant way by the subsequent generation of  bound states .",
    "thus , the part of the parameter space with a typical freeze - out abundance and a long  lifetime is confidently ruled out , which is shown in more detail in the following sections .",
    "in order to constrain the ( , ) parameter space from the catalytic path ( [ eq : traf - be9 ] ) to  @xcite , we need to set an _ upper limit _ on its primordial abundance from existing observations .",
    "it is generally accepted that the galactic evolution of the abundances of be , along with li and b , are dominated by cosmic - ray nucleosynthesis .",

    "if ' 's compounded in the previous sentences , the collider measurements could provide in this way an independent test for a hypothesis of the cbbn origin of @xmath182li and @xmath181be at lowest metallicities .",
    "complementary to that it will be exciting to see new analyses of @xmath181be and @xmath182li data from future astrophysical observations .",
    "from observations of beryllium in population ii halo stars at very low metallicities , we have extracted a nominal upper limit on primordial beryllium of @xmath276 .",
    "this limit allows one to set interesting constraints on models in which the primordial @xmath277 divide is bridged by catalytic effects . considering the primordial catalysis of @xmath181be via bound - state effects of a negatively charged massive relic @xmath51  @xcite ,",
    "we have derived -dependent upper limits on the @xmath51 yield prior to decay , . for a typical relic abundance @xmath278 ( @xmath214 ) ,",
    "we find that this @xmath279 limit translates into an upper limit on the @xmath51 lifetime of @xmath280 ( @xmath281 ) , which is quite comparable with the @xmath154 limit inferred from the primordial catalysis of @xmath182li . moreover , in the region where cbbn is efficient , we confirm that the ratio of the synthesized elements of @xmath282 lies in the range @xmath283  @xcite , which provides perhaps the most model - independent prediction in the whole cbbn paradigm .",
    "we have clarified that the presence of ( @xmath28 ) bound states can not relax the @xmath153 limits at long lifetimes @xmath154 in any substantial way .",
    "indeed , we have shown explicitly that late - time effects of ( @xmath28 ) bound states can affect the lithium and beryllium abundances synthesized at @xmath284 by not more than 10% .",
    "any substantial formation of ( @xmath28 ) at @xmath285 is immediately intercepted by the very efficient charge exchange reaction of ( @xmath28 ) with .",
    "this comes as no surprise given the large size of the ( @xmath28 ) system @xmath286 and the fact that the proton deconfinement probability approaches unity already for a distance of @xmath81 . in particular , we find that the fractional density of protons in bound states does not exceed the level of @xmath287 for @xmath288 . correspondingly , even with a ( @xmath28)induced -destruction - cross section as large as the unitarity limit , at most a few percent of the synthesized  could be destroyed . by the same argument",
    ", the  yield also remains unaffected by late - time catalysis .",
    "thus , we find that the possibility of allowed islands in the parameter region with typical @xmath153 and large @xmath154which was advocated in ref .",

    ", we have analyzed the new constraint in susy models in which the gravitino is the lsp and a long - lived charged slepton the nlsp , @xmath289 . for typical values of the slepton nlsp yield after decoupling ,",
    "the @xmath181be constraint obtained in this paper is found in close vicinity to the constraint from the primordial catalysis of @xmath182li .",
    "accordingly , the implications of the @xmath181be constraint for susy models do not differ much from the case of @xmath182li .",
    "the important advantage of -derived constraints is due to the fact that  is firmly detected in a significant number of stars at low metallicities , while the status of  observations remains somewhat questionable .",
    "another great virtue of -derived constraints is due to the expectations that an  abundance would remain less affected compared to the one of  by any stellar mechanism that might have caused the depletion in .",
    "therefore , one would not expect any serious depletion factors between the ( hypothetical ) primordial fraction of  and the actual observationally determined abundances of .",
    "one could question the calculational status of the cbbn chain ( [ eq : traf - be9 ] ) leading to .",
    "the rates for the first two reactions , resulting in ( ) and ( ) , are determined by electromagnetic interactions and thus are not associated with large nuclear uncertainties .",
    "the final step on the way to  is the neutron capture by the ( ) bound state .",
    "it is dominated by a resonant transition , and the associated rate is believed to have a factor of a few uncertainty @xcite .",
    "however , given the wealth of existing experimental data on the @xmath181be resonances , and rapid progress in nuclear calculations of few nucleon systems , one could hope that reasonably precise calculations of the catalytic rates may become available .",
    "the main shortcoming of our analysis is that only the catalytic effects below 10 kev are taken into account . in a generic framework of a hypothetical  particle , this",
    "is fully justified . however , in the specific susy model with gravitino lsp / slepton nlsp , one could go one step further and by combining the catalytic effects with the energy injection effects .",
    "fortunately for us , the question of synthesis is somewhat decoupled from the question of energy injection .",
    "the connection is mainly due to the modification of the deuterium abundance : for example , hadronic energy input at @xmath290 kev would lead to a larger deuterium abundance , which in turn would enhance the neutron abundance resulting in a larger abundance of .",
    "thus , the energy injection would lead to abundances of  that are somewhat _ larger _ than the ones that we determined by using the standard input for the deuterium abundance .",
    "since the main idea of our paper is to derive a conservative limit on susy models from , we can stay on the conservative side and disregard this modification , which would make the  limit only stronger .    in comparison to other cosmological constraints on gravitino lsp scenarios with a long - lived charged slepton nlsp , we find that the @xmath181be constraint ( together with the one from @xmath182li ) is the most relevant one in the collider - accessible region of slepton masses below 1  tev . indeed ,",
    "if a susy scenario with a long - lived @xmath5 is realized in nature , one might be able to determine the combination ( @xmath13,@xmath175 ) at collider experiments .",
    "assuming standard cosmological history , one might also `` invert '' the collider data and infer @xmath189 .",
    "independently of the assumption of the gravitino lsp , these quantities can then be confronted with constraints on the ( @xmath13 , @xmath189 ) parameter space imposed by the primordial catalysis of @xmath182li and @xmath181be .",
    "thereby , the cbbn constraints can be considered as predictions that could be tested in upcoming high - energy experiments .",
    "it will be most remarkable if collider measurements point to a ( @xmath13,@xmath175 ) combination in the vicinity of the cbbn constraints .",
    "indeed , this could provide an experimental hint for the primordial catalysis being the origin of existing abundances of both @xmath181be and @xmath182li at lowest metallicities .",
    "however tenuous the bbn ",
    "lhc connection may seem at the moment , we expect a lot more clarity brought to this issue in the coming years .",
