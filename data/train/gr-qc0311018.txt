    "the description of the motion of binary black holes within the einsteinian theory of gravity is quite a challenging problem and is likely to be finally solvable by numerical means only .",
    "however , it seems that the full success will occur in a far future .",
    "it has turned out in the past that analytical developments did always influence numerical investigations , hence further progress on the analytical side is certainly desirable . in this paper",
    "we shall present an analytical solution of truncated einstein equations for systems of non - spinning point - like objects , which shows many aspects of past numerical models .",
    "most of the numerical computations of quasi - stationary initial data for black - hole binaries are based on the assumption that the space metric is conformally flat @xcite .",
    "they often assume as well the existence of an approximate helical killing vector which permits to elaborate some manageable formulations ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the time - symmetric initial data of brill - lindquist @xcite were generalized by adding a non - conformally flat contribution that incorporates pieces of information provided by perturbative post - newtonian calculations @xcite .",
    "the present paper does not follow this line , but rather keeps the spirit of former numerical simulations .",
    "we essentially perform two simplifications : on the one hand , we adopt the often - used assumption of conformally flat space metric ; on the other hand , we attribute the non - linear gravitational field energy to point - like sources , which are modeled as dirac delta distributions .",
    "we solve the resulting truncated einstein equations analytically and get what we call , in reference to the point - like character of the source support , the _ skeleton _ solution .",
    "the calculations are carried out for @xmath0 bodies in a mathematically sound way by working from the beginning in @xmath1-dimensional space - time and taking the limit @xmath2 in the final expressions , so that the dirac delta distributions modeling the sources are consistently handled @xcite .",
    "our space metric and extrinsic curvature may be regarded as some generalization of the multiple black hole brill - lindquist initial value solution @xcite to arbitrary black - hole momenta preserving its original asymptotic structure .",
    "moreover , the energy function can be used as generator of the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "we shall refer to it as the skeleton hamiltonian associated to the full arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) hamiltonian .",
    "it agrees with the exact hamiltonian _ (",
    "i ) _ in the test body limit , _",
    "( ii ) _ at the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) approximation , i.e. , at the first order in powers of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 denoting the speed of light ) beyond the newtonian dynamics , and _ ( iii ) _ in the limit of special relativity in absence of gravity .",
    "the skeleton gravitational field is given explicitly , as well as the equations of motion .",
    "as a first application , we shall investigate the location of the last stable ( circular ) orbit ( lso ) for binary systems . in order to reach a proper accuracy ,",
    "the last - stable - orbit parameters are worked out up to the tenth post - newtonian ( 10pn ) approximation within the skeleton model .",
    "the comparison of second and third post - newtonian results derived from the skeleton model with the corresponding quantities computed in the full einstein theory delivers a quantitative measure for the missing terms in the skeleton approach .",
    "we are interested in a system of @xmath0 black holes interacting gravitationally .",
    "its description will be achieved within the adm hamiltonian framework using a @xmath1 splitting of space - time .",
    "the spatial indices are denoted by latin letters and vary from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , whereas the space - time indices are greek and vary from @xmath7 to @xmath6 . in a given chart , @xmath8 , the motion of the @xmath9th black hole",
    "is described by a curve @xmath10 , for @xmath11 .",
    "the conjugate momentum of the position @xmath12 is called @xmath13 .",
    "the constant mass parameter of the @xmath9th black hole is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian variables associated to the gravitational field are taken to be ( i ) the space metric @xmath15 induced by the full space - time metric @xmath16 on the hypersurface @xmath17 , and ( ii ) its conjugate momentum @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the newtonian gravitational constant . the other components of @xmath16 are parametrized by the lapse and shift functions : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 standing for the inverse of @xmath15 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the shift vector @xmath23 .",
    "the spatial indices will be raised and lowered with the help of @xmath22 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we now assume that the `` center - of - field '' @xmath24 of object @xmath9 can be modeled in the fictitious space - time associated with the flat metric by means of the dirac distribution @xmath25 .",
    "this prescription is known to lead to the brill - lindquist hamiltonian when the black hole velocities are set to zero , provided the mass parameters @xmath14 , @xmath11 , are identified with the brill - lindquist masses @xcite .",
    "it also leads to the correct 2pn dynamics @xcite for compact binaries , which can itself be recovered by means of the extended - body approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , the singularities generated by the distributions @xmath26 have shown to be curable by dimensional regularization at the 3pn order @xcite .",
    "similarly , we shall see in the present work that , for an appropriate choice of the space dimension @xmath6 , the @xmath26-type sources do not generate any ambiguity , so that the 3-dimensional quantities can be obtained by dimensional regularization .",
    "finally , this point - particle approach allows to bypass delicate investigations about the behavior of the gravitational field near the objects .    in an asymptotically flat space - time of dimension",

    "in particular , _ the 3pn approximation of the wilson - mathews model does not exist _ for binary black - holes .",
    "we must therefore treat the @xmath110 term differently .",

    "<S> an approximate analytical and non - linear solution of the einstein field equations is derived for a system of multiple non - rotating black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the associated space - time has the same asymptotic structure as the brill - lindquist initial data solution for multiple black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the system admits an arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) hamiltonian that can particularly evolve the brill - lindquist solution over finite time intervals . the gravitational field of this model may properly be referred to as a _ skeleton </S>",
    "<S> _ approximate solution of the einstein field equations . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation is based on a conformally flat truncation , which excludes gravitational radiation , as well as a removal of some additional gravitational field energy . </S>",
    "<S> after these two simplifications , only source terms proportional to dirac delta distributions remain in the constraint equations . </S>",
    "<S> the skeleton hamiltonian is exact in the test - body limit , it leads to the einsteinian dynamics up to the first post - newtonian approximation , and in the time - symmetric limit it gives the energy of the brill - lindquist solution exactly . the skeleton model for binary systems </S>",
    "<S> may be regarded as a kind of analytical counterpart to the numerical treatment of orbiting misner - lindquist binary black holes proposed by gourgoulhon , grandclment , and bonazzola , even if they actually treat the corotating case . along circular orbits , the two - black - hole skeleton solution is quasi - stationary and it fulfills the important property of equality of komar and adm masses . </S>",
    "<S> explicit calculations for the determination of the last stable circular orbit of the binary system are performed up to the tenth post - newtonian order within the skeleton model . </S>"
