    "<S> recently , several experimental anomalies were discussed as possible signatures for a new light particle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some predictions suggest light neutral bosons in the 10 mev - 10 gev mass range as dark matter candidates , which couple to electrons and positrons @xcite , to explain the anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> a number of attempts were made to find such particles by using data from running facilities @xcite or reanalyzing data of preceding experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since no evidence was found , limits were set on their mass and their coupling strength to ordinary matter . in the near future </S>",
    "<S> , ongoing experiments are expected to extend those limits to regions in mass and coupling strength which are so far unexplored . </S>",

    "<S> was measured by a 100% hpge detector . in the case of the broad ( @xmath38= 138 kev ) 18.15 mev resonance , the energy of the detected @xmath21 rays is determined by the energy of the proton at the time of its capture ( taking into account the energy loss in the target ) , so the energy distribution of the @xmath21 rays reflects the energy distribution of the protons . </S>",

    "<S> we observed a slight deviation from the simulated internal pair conversion correlation ( ipcc ) curve at large angles above 110@xmath19 confirming the results of a previous measurement @xcite , but the deviation could be explained by admixing some e1 component from the background . </S>",
    "<S> previously , pure m1 transitions from the decay of the 17.6 mev resonance were assumed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is true for the resonances itself , but not for the underlying background , which is reasonably small ( but not negligible ) for the 17.6 mev resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the background originates from the direct ( non - resonant ) proton capture and its multipolarity is dominantly e1 @xcite , and it adds to the m1 decay of the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the direct capture depends on the target thickness if the energy loss of the beam in the target is larger than the width of the resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.[441]b , the slope of the e1 angular correlation is much smaller than the slope of the m1 one , so by adding even a small contribution of e1 radiation , the angular correlation at large angles is modified considerably . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed simulated curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 441]b is obtained by fitting a small ( 1.4% ) e1 contribution to the dominant m1 one , which describes the experimental data reasonably well .    </S>",

    "<S> the e1 contribution is expected to be larger than that of the 17.6 mev resonance and , indeed , the deviation observed previously was much bigger in the 75@xmath19 - 130@xmath19 angular region @xcite . in the present work we extended the angular range to 170@xmath19 and improved the statistics to check if the previously observed deviation can be explained with some e1 mixing also in this case .    </S>",

    "<S> the angular correlation for m1 transitions in @xmath48be in the 15 + 18 mev region ( wide gate ) shows a clear deviation from the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> if we narrow the gate around 18 mev the deviation in the angular correlation at around 140 degrees is even larger , so the deviation can be associated with the 18 mev transition , and can not be explained by any amount of e1 mixing .    </S>",

    "<S> the observed deviations from the m1 ipc in case of the 17.6 mev transition could be explained by the contribution of the direct proton capture which presumably induce e1 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> however , e1 mixing alone can not explain the measured anomaly in the 18 mev pair correlation . </S>",

    "<S> the coupling constant ( @xmath65 ) of the dark z having a mass of 18 mev is predicted to be in the 10@xmath66 range for explaining the g-2 anomaly @xcite , which could fairly well explain the boson to @xmath21-decay branching ratio measured in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of the boson with the above coupling strength is expected to be in the order of 10@xmath67 s @xcite . </S>",
