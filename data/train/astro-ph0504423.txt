    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are broadly classified in two types .",
    "type 1 agns display broad hydrogen emission lines in the optical , while type 2 agns do not . the agn unification model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ties these two types together .",
    "an optically and geometrically thick dusty torus surrounds a central black hole , accretion disk and broad - line emission region .",
    "sources viewed face - on are recognized as type 1 , while edge - on sources are type 2 .",
    "observations at many wavelengths support this scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but until now there was a lack of constraining data in the mid - infrared .",
    "silicate dust is a major component of the interstellar medium in the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "it produces two spectral features in the infrared , a `` 10  feature '' which arises from a si@xmath1o stretching mode , and an `` 18  feature '' from an o@xmath1si@xmath1o bending mode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "emission or absorption from silicate dust is a dominant feature of the infrared spectrum produced by most mass - losing evolved stars , interstellar clouds , hii regions , and circumstellar disks around young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",

    "* ) , and a sample of mid - infrared detected , optically invisible , high - luminosity galaxies with redshifts of 1.7 @xmath2 z @xmath2 2.8 @xcite .",
    "type 2 agns show silicate dust in absorption as expected , but the mid - infrared spectroscopic data for type 1 agns have been scarce .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented spectra of two quasars with just the 10  feature in emission .",
    "while radiative transfer models clearly predict silicates to be in emission for type 1 sources @xcite , the absence of the silicate emission features at 10 and 18  has led to models without strong silicate emission . @xcite and @xcite have suggested that larger grains dominate the grain - size distribution .",
    "@xcite , instead , proposed that if the torus is clumpy , the 10  silicate emission can be sufficiently suppressed , although @xcite have challenged this suggestion .    here , we report the first spectroscopic detection of both silicate features at high signal to noise in five pg quasars .",
    "quasars are the high luminosity counterparts of seyfert 1 galaxies , showing the same broad emission lines that define type 1 agns .",
    "the five sources presented in this letter ( pg 0804 + 761 , pg 1211 + 143 , pg 1351 + 640 , i zw 1 [ = pg 0050 + 124 ] and 3c  273 [ = pg 1226 + 023 ] ) were selected from a sample of 12 agns based upon their prominant silicate emission features at both 10 and 18 .",

    "we have not defringed the spectra .",
    "residual artifacts also appear in some spectra in sl order 1 ( 7.514 ) .",
    "these take the form of a roughly sinusoidal deviation from the actual spectrum and are most obvious in the spectrum of 3c 273 at 810 , where they have a maximum strength of @xmath63% of the total flux .",
    "because 3c 273 has the weakest silicate emission feature in our sample , this artifact is even more pronounced in figures showing the continuum - subtracted spectra .",
    "we estimate uncertainties by comparing the spectra in the two nod positions , and these artifacts generally manifest themselves as a disagreement between the nod positions .",
    "the uncertainties only become apparant in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] shortward of 11(dark shaded area ) .",
    "none of these artifacts change the conclusions reported below .",
    "the spectra in figure [ fig1 ] are dominated by two broad emission features , which we identify as the si  o stretching mode and the o ",
    "si  o bending mode in silicate dust grains .",
    "the strength of the features is best appreciated by comparing the peak fluxes to the underlying silicate - graphite `` continuum '' . for pg 1351 ,",
    "i zw 1 and pg 1211 , we define the continuum using a spline interpolation between the 58  spectrum and a point at the extreme red end of the irs spectral range , where a change in slope indicates the end of the 18  silicate feature . for 3c 273 and pg 0804",
    ", the spectral structure at the red end of the irs spectral range does not show a similar change in slope .",
    "this may indicate that dust emission is still contributing at these wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we have assumed that the continuum at the red end runs somewhat below the observed spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] plots the resulting spline - interpolated continua ( dashed lines ) , while figure [ fig2 ] shows the resulting continuum - subtracted spectra .",
    "comparison of the silicate emission spectra in figure [ fig2 ] reveals that the ratio of the 18 and 10  features varies significantly within the sample .",
    "it is highest for 3c 273 and lowest for pg 0804 ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "also the onset and center of the 10  features shift significantly from one source to the next , 3c 273 and pg 1211 seem to appear at longer wavelengths .",
    "interestingly , these two sources happen to be the only radio loud quasars in our sample . in order to test whether these differences can be attributed to our choice of continuum , for each source we compared the silicate emission spectra for two other choices of underlying silicate - graphite continuum : one above and one below the adopted continuum , enclosing the shaded areas in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "as illustrated by the shaded areas in figure [ fig2 ] , this results in an uncertainty of up to 30% in the peak flux of the 18@xmath0 m feature and in the ratio of the 18 to 10  features .",
    "in contrast , the onset and center of the 10  features are not affected by different choices of continuum .",

    "this temperature is only physically meaningful under the assumption that the feature emitting region is optically thin . using the continuum - subtracted silicate opacity (",
    "see top panel in figure [ fig3 ] ) derived from @xcite and @xcite , we force the product of a blackbody and the silicate feature opacities to fit the observed continuum - subtracted silicate features . this reduces the problem to a single free parameter : the grain temperature , and avoids concerns related to a possible nonthermal contribution to the continuum .",
    "the resulting silicate grain temperatures ( t@xmath7 ) range between 140k for 3c 273 and 220k for i zw 1 , see table [ tab2 ] . these temperatures will change by as much as 15k depending on the choice for the underlying silicate - graphite continuum .",
    "uncertainties in the fitting process may amount to as much as another 10k .    using the derived silicate grain temperature ( t@xmath7 ) , it is possible to compute the silicate opacity spectrum by dividing the observed silicate emission spectrum by the blackbody spectrum with temperature t@xmath7 .",

    "the quasar profiles generally show good agreement at wavelengths beyond 10 .",
    "below 10 , only pg 1351 and i zw 1 match the synthetic profile well . in the other three spectra",
    ", the blue wing of the 10  appears weak , especially in 3c 273 and pg 1211 .",
    "apart from the artifacts in the 810  region of the spectrum of 3c 273 ( indicated by the large error bars in figure [ fig2 ] ; see  2 ) and the presence of atomic lines and pah emission in some spectra , the 10  band has a smooth appearance , showing no sign of a departure from amorphous grain structure .",
    "evidence for some crystalline grains do appear at longer wavelengths , most notably in the spectrum of pg 1351 at 23 .",
    "the weakness of the blue wing of the 10@xmath0 m silicate opacity profile in three of our sources appears to be significant and can not be explained by the uncertainties in the observed spectrum ( see the error bars in figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "grain size and composition , geometry , optically thick radiative transfer or a combination of these factors may explain the observed weakness .",
    "if our optically thin assumption is invalid , then the temperatures we have inferred can not be interpreted as real dust temperatures .",
    "@xcite reported a similar deficiency in the blue wing of the 10um absorption feature in ngc1068 , which they attribute to a different silicate grain composition .    a close inspection of the spectra in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] reveals numerous other features .",
    "those visible in at least one spectrum in the sample include the pah emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.2 , and emission lines at 10.5  ( [ siv ] ) , 12.8  ( [ neii ] ) , 14.3  ( [ nev ] ) , 15.6([neiii ] ) , 18.7  ( [ siii ] ) , and 25.9  ( [ oiv ] ) .",
    "direct comparisons of our observations to the predictions of published agn radiative transfer models are difficult given the limited resolution of model spectra in the 540  range of the irs .",
    "additionally , the model output is not tuned to be compared to the observed properties presented in table[tab2 ] .",
    "however , we can measure the feature - to - continuum ratio at 10  from the figures presented by @xcite .",
    "for the optically thin dust models of @xcite the values range from 0.1 for models where the grain - size distribution is dominated by larger grains to 1.5 for models with a standard grain - size distribution . in the face - on cases modeled by @xcite ,",
    "the values range from near zero for very thick and compact configurations to 1.0 for more extended torus models .",
    "these results are similar to those by @xcite and @xcite , but their highest 10  feature - to - continuum ratios are around 0.7 and 0.4 , respectively . given the observed range of 0.12 to 1.25 within our limited sample ( table [ tab2 ] ) , the model predictions for the 10  feature - to - continuum ratio are in good agreement .",
    "a similar comparison for the 18  feature - to - continuum ratio could not be undertaken , since the features are not as apparent as the 10features in the agn models .",
    "we have detected the 10 and 18  silicate emission features in five pg quasars  the first detection of both silicate features in emission in galaxies outside the local group and in agns in particular .",
    "given the existence of published mid - infrared photometric and spectroscopic data for these quasars , our finding may appear surprising at first .",
    "@xcite obtained 813  spectra of 3c 273 and i zw 1 , but the low contrast of the silicate feature to the strong continnum and the lack of coverage outside the n - band window prevented them from identifying silicate emission .",
    "the _ pht - s _ spectrometer on _ iso _",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of 3c 273 , i zw 1 and pg 0804 @xcite , but the limited wavelength coverage of _ pht - s _ ( only to 11.6 ) and the redshifts of the quasars allowed only the blue side of the 10  feature to be visible .",
    "because of these difficulties , silicate emission had remained unidentified in these five sources until now .",
    "our detection of silicate emission in type 1 agns provides support for the unified agn model @xcite .",
    "an agn torus viewed pole - on should offer an unobstructed line of sight to the torus dust , the surface of which is heated to temperatures of several hundred to a thousand kelvin by the radiation from the central engine .",
    "emission from this hot surface should produce a silicate feature in emission under most circumstances .    assuming a simple optically thin geometry , we find that the silicate grain temperature in our sources ranges from 140 to 220k , which is well below the dust sublimation temperature . detailed comparison of the derived opacity profiles for our quasars indicates that our simple model can not satisfactorally explain the absence of a blue wing in the 10  feature for three of our quasars .",
    "this likely points to a more complex geometry , involving radiative transfer within a ( partially ) optically thick environment  probably an agn torus .",
    "it may also point to differences in the grain size or composition .",
    "our derived silicate grain temperatures should , therefore , only be used as a characterization of the observed spectra , not as a means to infer the actual temperature and geometry of the agn .    from our limited sample of pg quasars ( three in addition to the sample discussed in this letter ) and a few seyfert 1 galaxies ,",
    "it is clear that 10  silicate emission is not a ubiquitous feature in mid - infared spectra of type 1 agns .",
    "only 5 out of 12 continuum - dominated agns show this feature prominently .",
    "interestingly , the quasars which show a 10  silicate emission feature all have bolometric luminosities higher than 10@xmath10 l@xmath11 , while the other type 1 agns are less luminous",
    ". models which can explain the presence of the 10  silicate emission feature in some type 1 agns will also need to explain their absence in others .",
