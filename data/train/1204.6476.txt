    "<S> [ figebvse ] . compared to the case without soc , </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding difference is that the pairing instability persists into the weak - coupling limit even with infinitesimally small soc . </S>",

    "<S> this is consistent with the previous many - body calculations , where the superfluid order parameter does not vanish for any polarization in the presence of soc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing instability in the large polarization limit is actually a consequence of the combined effects of the soc and the effective zeeman field . while soc breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the spins into different helicity bases , the effective zeeman field breaks the time reversal symmetry and opens a gap in the energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> as the spins are mixed in the lower branch , @xmath0-wave pairing is possible even in the large polarization limit @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> apparently , the pairing state that we discuss here is related to the topological superfluid phase in the thermodynamic limit when a finite density of spin - down atoms are present @xcite .     as a function of @xmath36 for different soc strengths and a fixed effective zeeman field @xmath37 : @xmath38 ( thin solid line ) , @xmath39 ( thin dashed line ) , @xmath40 ( bold solid line ) , @xmath41 ( bold dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) evolution of the center - of - mass momentum of the molecular ground state for different soc strengths and a fixed effective zeeman field @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    another important observation is that , for small soc , the pairing instability leads to an fflo - like pairing state with a finite center - of - mass momentum @xmath42 whose magnitude approaches the fermi wave vector @xmath21 in the weak - coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> figebvse](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the interaction is tuned toward the strongly interacting region , the center - of - mass momentum becomes smaller and drops to zero at a critical @xmath43 , where the system undergoes a first - order transition to a pairing state with zero center - of - mass momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the critical @xmath43 for this first - order transition is , in general , a function of the soc strength and the effective zeeman field @xmath1 . as demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figcritalp](a ) , for small @xmath1 , @xmath43 decreases monotonically as the soc strength becomes larger , and eventually vanishes at a critical soc strength @xmath44 . beyond @xmath44 only pairing states with zero center - of - mass momentum are stable for arbitrary interaction strength . for larger @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath43 on the soc strength becomes non - monotonic . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the pairing state becomes non - fflo - like in the weak coupling limit for large @xmath1 , and that one may encounter up to two first - order transitions if the interaction is tuned with fixed soc and zeeman field . </S>",
    "<S> hence for a fixed zeeman field , the stability of the fflo state is affected by soc in two contrasting ways : while the competition between the fflo state and the pairing state with zero center - of - mass momentum limits the stability region of the fflo state , the pairing instability induced by soc effectively increases the stability region of the fflo state , especially in the weak - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding question here is what are the topological properties of the fflo pairing state , which deserves further investigation in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> now that we understand the nature of the pairing states in the weak - coupling limit , we may derive an analytical expression for the molecular energy in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the divergence of the gap equation in the many - body case @xcite , the summation in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ molenergyeqn ] ) must diverge when @xmath35 , as dictated by the pairing instability . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the molecular ground state in the weak - coupling limit corresponds to the lowest - lying singularity of the summand on the right - hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ molenergyeqn ] ) . to evaluate this energy </S>",
    "<S> , we set the denominator in the summand to zero and minimize the molecular energy with the constraint @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> as the center - of - mass momentum @xmath32 is either @xmath21 or @xmath45 in the weak - coupling limit , we need only consider these two cases . </S>",
    "<S> for the fflo state with @xmath46 , we find the lowest energy for the occurrence of the singularity at @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the angle between @xmath42 and @xmath50 ) . for @xmath51 , </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic energy is given by @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> with these , the critical soc strength @xmath44 at which the fflo - like pairing state vanishes at @xmath56 can be calculated as a function of the effective zeeman field @xmath1 [ see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> figcritalp](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , the stability region of the fflo - like pairing state decreases as the zeeman field @xmath1 increases . </S>",

    "<S> the energy of the dressed polaron state is then lowered and the molecular state in eq . </S>",
