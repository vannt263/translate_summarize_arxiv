    ", a record is an extreme value that is defined relative to all previous values in the time series .",
    "record events are of interest in various areas of life and science such as climatology @xcite and sports @xcite , but also in biology @xcite .",
    "a record is usually a rare and remarkable event that will be remembered by observers . not without good reason the term record originates from the latin verb _",
    "recordari _ - _ to recall , to remind_.    the classic results for records drawn from series of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables ( rv s ) are well established , see @xcite for review . in this work we concentrate on two important quantities in particular .",
    "the first one is the probability for a certain entry in a time series to be a record , and the second one is the probability that the entries of a time series are ordered , or in other words , that _ all _ events are records . for i.i.d .",
    "rv s both these quantities are completely universal for all continuous probability density functions .",
    "this can be shown by the so called _ stick - shuffling _ argument : the last one of @xmath4 identically distributed entries ( sticks ) in a time series is equally likely to be a record as all other entries , and therefore the probability @xmath8 for the @xmath4th event to be a record , henceforth referred to as the _ record rate _ ,",
    "is given by @xmath9 accordingly the expected mean number of records @xmath10 up to a time @xmath4 can be obtained by computing the harmonic sum : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the euler - mascheroni constant . from similar considerations one obtains the statistics of waiting times between record breaking events which turn out to be universal as well .",
    "it is equally straightforward to compute the probability for all events in a series of length @xmath6 to be ordered in size . since this case is only one of @xmath13 possible and equally likely permutations of all @xmath6 events , the _ ordering probability _",
    "@xmath14 is given by @xmath15 we conclude that the two quantities of interest are related by @xmath16 which reflects the fact that record events are independent in the i.i.d .",
    "case @xcite .",
    "we will return to this point below in section 2 .",
    "in contrast to the properties of record times , the distributions of record values are not completely universal , but their asymptotic behavior falls into three different universality classes that are analogous to the universality classes of extreme value statistics : the _ weibull _ class of distributions with finite support , the _ gumbel _ class of distributions with exponential - like tails , and the _ frchet _ class of power law tailed distributions @xcite .    given that the statistics of records for i.i.d .",
    "rv s is well understood , it is natural to ask what happens when the underlying time series is correlated , or when the rv s are drawn from a distribution that varies in time .",
    "an important example of a correlated random process is the random walk , and the record statistics of this process was recently analyzed by majumdar and ziff @xcite .",
    "the simplest realization of a time - dependent distribution is the _ linear drift model _ ( ldm ) first considered by ballerini and resnick @xcite . in this model the @xmath4th entry in the time series is of the form @xmath17 where @xmath2 is a constant and the @xmath18 are i.i.d .",
    "rv s . in this simple scenario",
    "the probability density @xmath19 of @xmath20 is of the form @xmath21 with a fixed probability density @xmath22 and the corresponding cumulative distribution function @xmath23 , which is the distribution of the i.i.d .",
    "part @xmath1 of @xmath24 .",
    "we will usually consider upper records and assume @xmath25 .",
    "the ldm was originally introduced as a model for sports records in improving populations @xcite , and it has recently appeared in the context of the dynamics of elastic manifolds in random media @xcite . an important motivation for",
    "the present work comes from the interest in the consequences of global warming for the occurrence of temperature records @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the effect of warming on daily temperature measurements was modeled using a gaussian probability density with a linear trend , and it was shown that this very simple model is capable of quantitatively describing the statistics of record - breaking temperatures at european and american weather stations .",
    "in the climate context the drift speed @xmath2 is typically small compared to the standard deviation of @xmath26 , which suggests to consider the behavior of the record rate @xmath27 for small @xmath2 and finite @xmath4 .",
    "this approach is complementary to previous work on the ldm @xcite , which has mostly been concerned with the asymptotic behavior of the record rate for @xmath28 .",
    "another application that motivates our research comes from the study of adaptive paths in evolutionary biology . in this context , a path is a collection of mutations that change the genotype of an organism into another genotype of higher fitness . given that mutation rates are small , the evolution of a population usually proceeds one mutation at a time . for a given set of @xmath6 mutations , there are then @xmath13 distinct paths which correspond to the different orders in which the mutations can occur .",
    "since a mutation spreads in the population only if it confers a fitness advantage , a given pathway is _ accessible _ to adaptive evolution only if the fitness values of the intermediate genotypes increase monotonically along the path , that is , if they are arranged in ascending order @xcite .    in view of the complexity of real fitness landscapes ,",
    "the intricate interactions between different mutations are often modeled by assigning fitness values at random to genotypes @xcite .",
    "one such model , which is closely related to the ldm , was introduced by aita _",
    "_ in the context of protein evolution @xcite . in this model",
    "the fitness @xmath20 of a particular intermediate genotype with @xmath4 mutations is assumed to consist of an i.i.d .",
    "rv @xmath18 and a systematic part @xmath29 , where @xmath25 if the mutations move the population closer to the global fitness peak , and the value of @xmath2 ( relative to the standard deviation of the @xmath18 ) can be adjusted to tune the ruggedness of the fitness landscape . taking into account also the initial genotype with no mutations ,",
    "a total of @xmath30 genotypes with fitness values @xmath31 are encountered along a path .",
    "the probability for a path to be accessible in this model is then just @xmath32 , and the expected number of accessible paths is @xmath33 .",
    "an immediate corollary of ( [ pnbasic ] ) is that the expected number of accessible paths of length @xmath6 in a completely random fitness landscape without any average uphill slope ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "here we consider both the record rate @xmath8 and the ordering probability @xmath14 for the linear drift model .",
    "we distinguish between a small drift @xmath2 that is much smaller than the characteristic width of the distribution ( in most cases the standard deviation ) , and a large drift that is much larger than this width .",
    "both cases are of practical relevance . in section 2",
    "we discuss the general properties of record statistics for systems with linear drift , with particular emphasis on the correlations between record events .",
    "in the subsequent section 3 we will present new results for small @xmath2 .",
    "we examine the record statistics for members of the three extreme - value classes individually and find the corresponding asymptotic behaviors . in section 4 we analyze the case of large @xmath2 . throughout monte - carlo simulations",
    "are used to confirm the analytical results .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present a brief summary , discuss related issues and give an outlook on further possible research .",
    "some of the calculational details are relegated to appendices .",
    "the values taken by the @xmath36 are stochastically independent .",
    "the probability that all @xmath4 values are less than a given value @xmath37 factorizes to @xmath38 . here @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "are , as stated in the introduction , the probability densities and cumulative distribution functions of the @xmath41 .",
    "thus , given the value @xmath42 of the i.i.d .",
    "part @xmath1 of @xmath24 , the probability that all previous rv s @xmath43 are smaller than @xmath24 is @xmath44 .",
    "the probability that a rv @xmath24 drawn from a general time - dependent distribution @xmath45 is a record is therefore given by @xcite @xmath46 = p_n = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty { \\mathrm{d}}x    f_n\\left(x\\right ) \\prod \\limits_{i=1}^{n-1 }    f_i\\left(x\\right ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath47 for the ldm .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the limiting record rate @xmath48 exists and is nonzero for @xmath25 provided the distribution @xmath49 of the i.i.d .",

    "has proven difficult , but in the case where the @xmath1 are gumbel distributed , i.e. @xmath62 , one can use the fact that this distribution obeys the relation @xmath63 to explicitly perform the integration in ( [ genp ] ) @xcite . with the abbreviation @xmath64 and the substitution @xmath65 one obtains @xmath66 by use of the incomplete geometric series . keeping @xmath2 fixed , one obtains in the limit @xmath28 the asymptotic record rate @xmath67 , while for @xmath68 one recovers the i.i.d .",

    "the relation used to evaluate ( [ gumbelp ] ) for the gumbel case can also be used in ( [ genp2 ] ) , as before starting from the innermost integral , which yields @xmath71 summing the geometric series as in ( [ gumbelp ] ) , one obtains @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the grand canonical partition function of a system of bosonic particles with energy levels @xmath74 at inverse temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this partition function also occurs as one limit in the integer partition problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "for @xmath123 the decay is slower than the @xmath124-decay of the record rate in the absence of a drift , which implies that the drift will nevertheless dominate the behavior for long times .",

    "the decay of @xmath96 is faster @xmath124 and the limit on the right hand side of ( [ p(c ) ] ) vanishes for any @xmath2 , which implies that the drift is asymptotically irrelevant .",
    "the borderline situation @xmath126 has been studied by de haan and verkade @xcite , who find that the asymptotics depends nontrivially on the value of @xmath2 in this case .    in general",
    "the results presented so far show that the effect of the drift on a broad distribution is smaller than on a more narrow distribution .",
    "a similar qualitative trend was found in @xcite for probability densities with increasing variance .     and the drifting case with drift @xmath127 .",

    "a very simple representative of the gumbel class is the exponential distribution @xmath134 . in this case",
    "the first order expansion ( [ p_nc_general ] ) assumes the following form : @xmath135 the integral can be solved by two partial integrations and one finds @xmath136 that is , the correction term is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "the calculation for the gaussian distribution , arguably the most important member of the gumbel class , is more complicated . for convenience",
    "we consider a gaussian distribution of unit variance , @xmath137 the integral of interest reads @xmath138 which will be evaluated for large @xmath4 using the saddle point approximation . with the definition @xmath139",

    "it is instructive to compare the asymptotics of the correction term @xmath96 derived in the preceding subsections to the behavior of the limiting record rate @xmath159 for small @xmath2 , which was studied by le doussal and wiese @xcite .",
    "heuristically , the two quantities can be related as follows .",
    "we have seen above that , for any choice of @xmath49 with a finite first moment , the correction term @xmath96 becomes large compared to @xmath124 for large @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that , for any @xmath25 , the first order correction will eventually become comparable to the zeroth order record rate @xmath124 .",
    "the corresponding time scale @xmath160 can be estimated from @xmath161 for times @xmath162 the first - order expansion breaks down and the record rate saturates at a nonzero limiting value @xmath159 .",

    "note that the large @xmath2 asymptotics for the weibull class is trivial , because both @xmath8 and @xmath14 become identically equal to unity once @xmath2 exceeds the range of support of @xmath49 . inserting the expressions ( [ epsiga],[epsila],[epsile ] ) into ( [ asymptoticpl ] ) and also considering the asymptotics of the exact expression for @xmath88 derived in ( [ gumbelapp ] ) , we see that in the limit of large @xmath6 and @xmath2 the behavior of the ordering probability is generally of the approximate form @xmath197,\\ ] ] where @xmath198 for the gumbel and exponential distributions , @xmath199 for the gaussian , and @xmath200 for the lvy distribution .",
    "check of the expression for @xmath201 from ( [ epsile ] ) . for @xmath202 , the range @xmath203 was numerically explored as for the data shown in figure [ numericalcollapse ] .",
    "the curves obtained this way were then fitted to the form @xmath204 .",
    "the value of @xmath201 obtained in this way is shown here for various values of @xmath133 and compared to the analytic expression ( [ gamma ] ) . ]    to verify the approximations made in this section , we performed numerical simulations , see figure [ numericalcollapse ] and figure [ gammacheck ] .",
    "the results indicate that our approach , although quite rough and not necessarily well - controlled , does indeed capture the interesting regime rather well for sufficiently large @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "in this article we considered the statistics of records and sequences of records of random variables with a linear trend as described by ( [ ynbasic ] ) .",
    "we numerically explored the correlations between record events ( cf .",
    "figure [ correcev ] ) and analytically investigated the record rate @xmath205 and the ordering probability @xmath88 in the limiting regimes of small and large drift velocities , @xmath206 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "for the regime of @xmath207 , we have not found a generally applicable method .",
    "thus the behavior of @xmath205 and @xmath88 in this regime remains an open problem .",
    "specifically , we considered the effect of a small linear drift on distributions of the three extreme - value classes . while this effect is varying even within the individual classes we still found systematic differences between them . for the frchet class of distributions with power - law tails we found that the coefficient of the leading order correction to the record rate decays as @xmath208 for large @xmath4 .",
    "this implies a distinction between distributions with and without a finite first moment : for @xmath123 the correction decays more slowly than the unperturbed record rate @xmath124 , which implies that the drift dominates asymptotically and @xmath27 attains a nonzero limit for @xmath209 ; on the other hand , for @xmath125 the drift is asymptotically irrelevant .    for the considered distributions of the gumbel class",
    "the situation was a bit more complicated .",
    "for the exponential distribution we found a constant additive correction to the record rate , while for generalized gaussian probability densities @xmath210 the correction term was shown to be of order @xmath211 , which increases ( decreases ) with @xmath4 when @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "for the distributions of the weibull class , the effect of the drift is the strongest , and the correction term generally increases as a power law in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , for highly singular distributions with @xmath111 in ( [ weibull ] ) , we found indications for a non - analytic behavior of @xmath27 which will be investigated elsewhere . generally speaking , narrow distributions are very sensitive to drift , while for broad distributions with heavy tails the effect is much weaker .",
    "we have also pointed out that the behavior of the first order correction term @xmath96 obtained in this paper precisely matches earlier results for the asymptotic record rate @xmath159 @xcite .    for the probability of a sequence of @xmath6 consecutive records , we find the following : for @xmath206 , the distribution @xmath49 of the i.i.d . part of @xmath24 enters to leading order in @xmath2 only as a numerical constant @xmath214 , see ( [ gensmallc ] ) , but the @xmath6-dependence is completely universal for all distributions for which the integral exists . on the other hand , for @xmath82 and @xmath215 , the combination in which @xmath2 and @xmath6 enter @xmath165 depends explicitly on the tail of the underlying distribution @xmath53 .",
    "this indicates that somewhere in the regime of intermediate @xmath2 , there is a crossover in the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath88 from a highly universal to a less universal form .",
    "the result ( [ gensmallc ] ) has important implications in the context of adaptive paths of evolutionary biology : recalling that the expected number of accessible paths between two genotypes which are @xmath6 mutations apart is given by @xmath216 , we see in the presence of an arbitrarily small drift this quantity _ increases _ with @xmath6 as @xmath217 .",
    "thus even a weak systematic fitness gradient dramatically increases the accessibility of mutational pathways in the direction of increasing fitness .",
    "this work was supported by dfg within sfb 680 _ molecular basis of evolutionary innovations _ and the bonn - cologne graduate school for physics and astronomy .",
    "we begin by computing the saddle point @xmath141 defined by @xmath218 , where the function @xmath219 is given in ( [ g ] ) .",
    "the saddle point satisfies @xmath220 for large @xmath4 this can only be solved by @xmath221 , which implies that @xmath222 and reduces ( [ saddle_point_equation ] ) to @xmath223 by taking the square on both sides of ( [ saddle_point_eq_approx ] ) one finds that the solution is given in terms of the lambert w - function @xmath143 @xcite as @xmath224 ( recall that @xmath143 is defined implicitly through @xmath144 ) . using ( [ saddle_point_eq_approx ] ) the function @xmath225 and its second derivative at the saddle point take the form @xmath226 and @xmath227 it follows that @xmath228 using once more ( [ saddle_point_eq_approx ] ) to replace @xmath229 we obtain @xmath230 for large @xmath4 , where we have used the expansion @xcite @xmath147 to evaluate ( [ saddle_point ] ) .",
    "this expansion also shows that the leading corrections to the asymptotic expression ( [ in_saddle2 ] ) are of order @xmath231 , which accounts for the relatively large deviations from the numerical results seen in figure [ gaussfigure ] .",
    "here we consider probability densities of the form @xmath232 with @xmath233 and @xmath234^{-1}. $ ] we want to evaluate the integral ( [ beta_integral ] ) in the saddle point approximation .",
    "introducing the function @xmath235 the saddle point equation @xmath236 reads , for large @xmath4 , @xmath237 the solution can again be expressed in terms of the lambert - w function .",
    "defining @xmath238 we find @xmath239 note that this expression is valid both for @xmath212 ( @xmath240 ) and for @xmath213 ( @xmath241 ) , but in the latter case the second real branch of @xmath242 has to be used @xcite . using the asymptotics of @xmath243 we obtain @xmath244 for large @xmath4 .    with the help of ( [ betasaddle ] ) the function @xmath225 and its second derivative at the saddle point",
    "become @xmath245 and @xmath246 for large @xmath247 .",
    "thus , using ( [ betasaddle ] ) , we see that @xmath248 , and therefore ( ignoring all constant prefactors ) @xmath249",
    "in this appendix , we will provide the details on the expansion of @xmath250 into the terms on the right hand side of ( [ chainofintegrals ] ) .",
    "the starting point is the relation @xmath251 which can be proved by applying integration by parts to the first term on the right hand side . with the identities @xmath252 and @xmath253 , one obtains from ( [ intbyparts ] ) @xmath254 the first term of the sum is already identical to the first term in ( [ chainofintegrals ] ) for @xmath255 . using ( [ intbyparts ] ) on the inner of the two integrals of the second term of the sum above , one obtains @xmath256 dividing by @xmath257 and putting this back into ( [ helper ] ) with @xmath258",
    ", one sees that now the first _ two _ terms of the sum agree with ( [ chainofintegrals ] ) . by repeating this procedure on the terms that do not yet match and noting that finally @xmath259 , one has expanded @xmath250 into the rhs of ( [ chainofintegrals ] ) , which concludes the proof of ( [ gensmallc ] ) .",
