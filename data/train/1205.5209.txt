    "topological insulators ( tis ) constitute a new state of matter with an insulating bulk and an odd number of metallic dirac cones at their surface @xcite .",
    "it was predicted @xcite and confirmed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite that the compounds bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 possess such a single surface state ( ss ) .",
    "owing to this spin locking property , sss of tis are unique metallic systems for the study of fundamental magnetotransport properties and for the realization of future spintronics based devices . unfortunately such transport experiments have faced a major difficulty so far .",
    "indeed most tis samples present enough residual bulk conductance to overwhelm the actual surface contribution @xcite .",
    "the shubnikov - de haas oscillations reported in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 crystals originate exclusively from the bulk 3d bands indicating a low mobility for the surface dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless recent progress has been achieved by using ultrathin films of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite or bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite exfoliated on high - k dielectric insulator in order to improve the surface / bulk conductance ratio and to allow the gating of the surface state . from the gate voltage dependence of the total conductance , it was possible to separate bulk and surface contributions using a classical two - carrier model @xcite .",
    "most recently the surface conductance of strained hgte samples has been reported in truly 3d slabs with thicknesses exceeding @xmath2 nm and in the absence of significant bulk conductance @xcite . at low temperatures and for small samples , the quantum correction to transport",
    "was recently probed experimentally : the dependence of conductance on weak magnetic fields displays the expected weak antilocalization while the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) were observed in some of those experiments @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the crossover between the symplectic and unitary universality classes upon breaking time - reversal symmetry has been observed in ultrathin samples of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 @xcite .    theoretically , describing the transport properties of topological insulator surface states amounts to consider the diffusion properties of two dimensional dirac fermions .",
    "indeed , at the lowest order in @xmath3 theory the ss fermi surface is circular with a spin winding in the plane . at low energy , this two dimensional conductor shares a lot of similarities with graphene but with the following important differences : the momentum is locked to a real spin as opposed to a a - b sublattice pseudo - spin in graphene , and it has a single dirac cone as opposed to the four - fold degeneracy of the dirac cone in graphene . for this simpler dirac metal , the conductivity and the induced in - plane spin polarization were calculated as functions of the 2d carrier concentration @xcite .",
    "far from the dirac point , surface spin - orbit may generically produce a significant hexagonal warping ( hw ) of the spin texture . as a result",
    "the fermi surface exhibits a snowflake or a nearly hexagonal fermi surface depending on the carrier density , and the spin gets tilted out of the plane @xcite .",
    "those effects have been confirmed by arpes and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments performed on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 crystals where hw is particularly strong @xcite , and also in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "characterizing quantitatively the hw and therefore the amount of out - of plane spin polarization is a crucial issue in view of potential spintronics applications , and has been the subject of ab - initio studies @xcite and arpes experiments @xcite .",
    "this hexagonal warping is specific to the dirac metal at the surface of topological insulators , and different from the trigonal warping encountered at high energies in graphene . its amplitude is stronger in the metallic regime of high fermi energy which is of interest in the present paper : a full description of transport properties in this regime necessitates to include its presence in the model .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that hexagonal warping enhances perturbatively the classical drude conductivity with respect to the unwarped model @xcite . however , as we will show in this article a description of the effects of this hexagonal warping requires to go beyond the previous perturbative descriptions .",
    "in this paper , we develop a description of the diffusion of these surface states which is non - perturbative in the warping amplitude .",
    "we investigate theoretically the classical 2d charge diffusion within an hexagonally warped surface states using both a standard diagrammatic formalism and a boltzmann equation approach . in this classical regime",
    ", we find that the hexagonal warping on one hand strongly reduces the density of states and on the other hand increases the diffusion coefficient for the dirac surface states . the combination of both effects is found to correspond to an increase of the classical conductivity as a function of the warping amplitude .",
    "interestingly , as the warping amplitude increases with fermi energy , that dependence on the warping amplitude manifests itself in the behavior of the conductivity as a function of the fermi energy . in the second part of this article , we focus on the quantum correction to the conductivity , relevant in a phase coherent conductor .",
    "these quantum corrections are known to depend on the symmetry class of the associated anderson localization problem . similarly to graphene with only intra - valley disorder , the single dirac cone model is known to correspond to the symplectic / aii class . within this symplectic class",
    "the dirac model differs from graphene with long - range disorder or electrons with spin - orbit randomness by the presence of a topological term in the associated field theory @xcite .",
    "this topological term explains the absence of anderson localization for these topological insulators surface states @xcite , however it plays no role in the diffusive metallic regime .",
    "in this regime , the universal properties of both weak localization and conductance fluctuations are just the same as for any model on the two dimensional symplectic / aii class .",
    "we will recall these results , and show that the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on warping manifests itself in a dependence of the weak localization correction and conductance fluctuations away from their universal values .",
    "in particular , this diffusion constant parameterizes the universal cross - over from the symplectic / aii class to the unitary / a class when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the surface states .",
    "the shape of the associated cross - over functions now depends strongly on the warping amplitude , and thus the fermi energy . finally , we identify a property unique to the topological insulator surface states : a reduction of the conductance fluctuations by the application of a in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the model in section [ sec : model ] .",

    "as we will show below , these large values of warping amplitude are indeed beyond the reach of a perturbative approach , and require a non - perturbative description of diffusion in the presence of warping .",

    "indeed , even if the scalar disorder is isotropic and spin diagonal , the spin - locking property makes the scattering anisotropic ( even for a circular unwarped fermi surface ) .",

    "<S> we consider the transport properties of topological insulators surface states in the presence of uncorrelated point - like disorder , both in the classical and quantum regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the transport properties of those two - dimensional surface states depend strongly on the amplitude of the hexagonal warping of their fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a perturbative analysis of the warping fails to describe the transport in experimentally available topological insulators , such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we develop a fully non - perturbative description of these effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the dependence of the warping amplitude on the fermi energy manifests itself in a strong dependence of the diffusion constant on this fermi energy , leading to several important experimental consequences </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the combination of a strong warping with an in plane zeeman effect leads to an attenuation of conductance fluctuations in contrast to the situation of unwarped dirac surface states . </S>"
