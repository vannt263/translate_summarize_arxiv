    "in this section , we provide some remarks on the proposed transmission schemes , and the dof region for the three - receiver gaussian mimo broadcast channel with rmsi .",
    "these remarks provide some hints about the dof region for the channel when there are four or more receivers .      in this subsection",
    ", we make the observation that we can achieve the dof region for all 16 possible rmsi configurations using three transmission schemes .",
    "one for the side information configurations @xmath281 ( the scheme for the channel without rmsi , i.e. , @xmath282 , can be used for all these configurations as they have the same dof region ) , one for @xmath283 , and one for the rest , i.e. , @xmath284 . for @xmath285 and @xmath286 ,",
    "the scheme for @xmath138 can be used as they have the same dof region . for @xmath75 , @xmath287 ,",
    "based on the following two points , the region achieved by the scheme for @xmath138 is at least as large as the region achieved by the scheme for this configuration .",
    "first , the construction of @xmath140 for @xmath75 is a special case of the construction of @xmath140 for @xmath138 .",
    "second , the construction of @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath75 can be viewed as a modification of those for @xmath138 in the following way : we replace some columns of these matrices that are constructed using i ) the side information of the receivers , and/or ii ) zero forcing in the scheme for @xmath138 , with the columns that are constructed independently and randomly in the scheme for @xmath75 .",
    "the replacement is done  depending on the extra side information in @xmath75 compared to @xmath138in a way that we still have the same number of interference - free dimensions at the receivers .",
    "consequently , the scheme for @xmath138 can also achieve the dof region of the channel with @xmath82 , @xmath287 .      in this subsection , we introduce some properties of the dof region of the gaussian mimo broadcast channel with rmsi under two specific antenna configurations where i ) the number of antennas at the transmitter is greater than or equal to the sum - number of antennas at the receivers , and ii ) the number of antennas at all the nodes are equal .      under this configuration , according to theorem  [ theorem : dof ] , the dof region of the channel is @xmath288 this shows that the side information available at the receivers can not enlarge the dof region of the channel when @xmath246 .",
    "this is because zero forcing can cancel the interference at all the receivers , and the transmitter can simultaneously create three independent virtual mimo point - to - point channels , one to each receiver  @xmath6 with dof @xmath11 .",
    "then the side information which is used to alleviate the interference at the receivers is no longer useful as far as the dof region is concerned .      under this configuration , according to theorem  [ theorem : dof ] , the dof region of the channel is @xmath290 where @xmath233 is an acyclic induced subgraph of the side information graph of the channel .    in this configuration , as opposed to the previous configuration , we can not perform zero forcing , and the side information plays a key role .",
    "based on this , and as the dof region is defined in the high signal - to - noise ratio region , we show that there are some common properties between the dof region and the capacity region of the index coding problem  @xcite .",
    "the three - receiver index coding problem considers a noiseless broadcast channel with rmsi where there are three messages , @xmath291 , @xmath87 , each requested by one receiver , and a common noiseless link that carries @xmath35 bits .",
    "arbabjolfaei et al .",
    "@xcite established the capacity region of the index coding problem for up to five receivers .",
    "we present their result for the three - receiver case as proposition  [ proposition : capindexcoding ] .",
    "the capacity region of the three - receiver index coding problem is achieved using flat coding and time sharing  ( * ? ? ? * section iii ) .",
    "[ proposition : capindexcoding ] the capacity region of the three - receiver index coding problem is the set of all rate triples @xmath240 , each satisfying @xmath292 where @xmath233 is an acyclic induced subgraph of the side information graph of the channel .",
    "the first property that we can see from   and   is that the dof region normalized by the number of antennas at each node is the same as the capacity region of index coding .",
    "another property for the capacity region of index coding is that removing the arcs that are not part of a directed cycle does not decrease the capacity region  @xcite . according to",
    ", this property is also valid for the dof region of the three - receiver gaussian mimo broadcast channel with the same number of antennas at all the nodes .",
    "however , this property is not valid for the dof region in general .",
    "for instance , the dof region of the channel with @xmath166 is strictly larger than the one of the channel with @xmath293 when @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath250 .",
    "this property is not valid also for the capacity region of the gaussian mimo broadcast channel when even all the nodes have the same number of antennas .",
    "for example , in a previous study  @xcite , we established the capacity region of the gaussian channel with the side information graphs @xmath294 and @xmath54 where all the nodes have one antenna .",
    "the results show that the capacity region of the channel with @xmath166 is strictly larger than the one of the channel with @xmath293 when the absolute value of the channel gain for receiver  1 is the largest one and the one for receiver  3 is the smallest one .",
    "we considered the three - receiver gaussian multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) broadcast channel with an arbitrary number of antennas at each node .",
    "we assumed that ( i ) channel matrices are known to all the nodes , ( ii ) the receivers have private - message requests , and ( iii ) each receiver may know some of the messages requested by the other receivers as receiver message side information ( rmsi ) .",
    "we established the degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) region of the channel for all 16 possible non - isomorphic rmsi configurations . to this end , we first proposed a scheme for each rmsi configuration which utilizes both the null space and the side information of the receivers .",
    "we used our schemes in conjunction with time sharing for 15 rmsi configurations , and with time sharing and two - symbol extension for the remaining one .",
    "we then derived a tight outer bound for each rmsi configuration by constructing enhanced versions of the channel , and upper bounding their dof region .",
    "furthermore , we showed that some properties for the capacity region of the index coding problem also hold for the dof region where all the nodes have the same number of antennas .",
    "in this section , we present the proof of lemma  [ lemma : outerusingias ] .",
    "any acyclic induced subgraph , @xmath233 , of a side information graph represents a channel with rmsi where there are three or fewer receivers .",
    "we construct an enhanced channel for this channel . to this end , we first choose a receiver of this channel with outdegree zero , say receiver  @xmath23 , @xmath295 ( outdegree of a vertex ( receiver ) is the number of its outgoing arcs ) .",
    "we then provide the channel outputs at the other receivers of this channel to receiver  @xmath23 . in the enhanced channel",
    ", receiver  @xmath23 can first decode its own message and the messages of the other receivers with outdgeree zero ( if any ) as it has all the information using which they decode their messages .",
    "receiver  @xmath23 can then decode the messages of the receivers whose side information is already decoded at this receiver . by continuing this approach , as we have an acyclic subgraph",
    ", receiver  @xmath23 can decode all the messages @xmath296 , @xmath297 .",
    "consequently , from the gaussian mimo point - to - point channel where a transmitter with @xmath10 antennas wants to transmit the messages @xmath296 , @xmath297 , to a receiver with @xmath298 antennas , we obtain the necessary condition @xmath299 -35pt",

    "we then , choose a distribution @xmath304 , and generate @xmath305 codewords @xmath306 according to @xmath307 .",
    "we finally , using superposition coding , generate @xmath308 codewords @xmath309 for each @xmath310 according to @xmath311 .",

    "we assume without loss of generality that the transmitted messages are equal to zero by the symmetry of the codebook construction .",

    "@xmath328 hence , using the packing lemma , receiver  3 can reliably decode @xmath163 if @xmath329 .",
