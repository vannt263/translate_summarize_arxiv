    "second , a magnetic tower front ( `` tower front '' in the following discussions ) is located at @xmath96 , beyond which the magnetic field goes to zero , as seen in the _ top _ panel .",
    "this indicates that the gas within the magnetic tower jet is separated from the non - magnetized ambient gas beyond the tower front .",
    "we regard this front as a tangential discontinuity as the magnetic fields are tangential to the front without the normal component .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the radial and azimuthal field components ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) are dominant near the tower front ( @xmath99 ) but the axial field component @xmath100 becomes dominant only for @xmath101 .",

    "note that the reverse slow - mode mhd compressional wave could eventually steepen into the reverse slow - mode mhd shock wave via this nonlinear evolution .",
    "consequently , in the frame co - moving with the reverse slow - mode shock , a strong compression occurs behind the shock wave front and causes a local heating , as seen in the _ bottom _ panel and also fig .",

    "indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : t7.5_liner ] , we see that the magnetic pressure and the background pressure try to balance each other at the tower edge .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the external gas pressure at the tower edge .",
    "when the lobe experiences sufficient expansion , we expect the poloidal field strength to drop much faster than @xmath181 .",
    "so we have @xmath182 which gives @xmath183 this is generally consistent with our numerical result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : de_evo ] though it is difficult to make a firm quantitative determination since the lobes have not expanded sufficiently .    to make direct comparison between our simulations and observations , further analysis is clearly needed .",
    "note that for the magnetic tower model , the alfvn surface is located at the outer edge of the magnetic tower and flow within the magnetic tower is always sub - alfvnic .",
    "this is quite different from the hydromagnetic models where the mhd flow is accelerated and has passed through several critical velocity surfaces , including the alfvn surface .",
    "by performing 3-d mhd simulations we have investigated in detail the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic tower jets , which propagate through the stably stratified background that is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "our simulations , based on the approach developed in @xcite , confirm a number of the global characteristics developed in lynden - bell ( 1996 , 2003 ) and li et al .",
    "the results presented here give additional details for a dynamically evolving jet in a stratified background .",
    "the magnetic tower is made of helical magnetic fields , with poloidal flux and poloidal current concentrated around the central axis .",
    "the `` returning '' portion of the poloidal flux and current is distributed on the outer shell of the magnetic tower .",
    "together they form a self - contained system with magnetic fields and associated currents , being confined by the ambient pressure and gravity .",
    "the overall morphology exhibits a confined magnetic jet `` body '' with an expanded `` lobe '' .",
    "the confinement of the `` body '' comes jointly from the external pressure and the gravity .",
    "the formation of the lobe is due to the expansion of magnetic fields in a decreasing background pressure .",
    "a hydrodynamic shock wave initiated by the injection of magnetic energy / flux propagates ahead of the magnetic tower and can break the hydrostatic equilibrium of the ambient medium , causing a global gravitational contraction . as a result",
    ", a strong compression occurs in the axial direction between the magnetic tower front and the reverse slow - mode mhd shock wave front that follows .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic tower jets are deformed radially into a slender - shaped body due to the inward - directed flow of the ambient ( non - magnetized ) gas .",
    "the lobe is magnetically dominated and is likely filled with the toroidal magnetic fields generated by the central poloidal current . at the edge of the magnetic tower jet ,",
    "the outward - directed magnetic pressure gradient force is balanced by the inward - directed gas pressure gradient force , so the radial width of the magnetic tower can be determined jointly by the magnitude of the poloidal current and the magnitude of the external gas pressure . the highly wound helical magnetic field in the magnetic tower never reaches the force - free equilibrium precisely , but obtains radial force - balance , including the gas pressure gradient inside the magnetic tower .",
