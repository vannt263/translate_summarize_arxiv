    "ngc  5471 , one of the giant hii  regions in m101 , is two orders of magnitude larger and brighter than w49 , the largest hii  region in the milky way .",
    "what is special about m101 that it produces such bright hii  regions ?",
    "one hypothesis is that these regions result from the unusual properties of the molecular gas from which the stars that ionize the gas originate @xcite . in this paper",

    "@xcite proposed that either the initial mass function is enhanced in massive stars , or the gas is consumed more efficiently in these regions .",
    "the first idea has been investigated by rosa and benvenuti @xcite in a study of four giant hii  regions in m101 with the faint - object spectrometer on the hubble space telescope .",
    "they concluded that the initial mass function for stars with masses larger than 2  is similar to that in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this result is consistent with more recent studies of ob associations in inner part of m101 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there was an early indication that the star formation efficiency of massive stars in ngc  5461 is higher than the typical _ total _ star formation efficiencies observed in our galaxy @xcite ; however , the calculations of the molecular masses were rather crude . in ",

    "the average measured flux during the ngc  5461 observations was 0.80 jy , while the flux during the ngc  5462 observations a year later was 0.55 jy . since it is possible that the intrinsic brightness of the gain calibrator changed during the course of a year , we adopt these two separate values for the remaining analysis .    the data sets were edited to remove poor data with the main criterion being that the coherence on the gain calibrator was higher than 50% .",

    "after the basic reduction was completed , we used miriad @xcite to map and clean the data . because the signal - to - noise ratio was relatively small , we used natural weighting .",
    "all channel maps were cleaned to the @xmath43 level with fewer than 1000 iterations .",
    "the rms noise and the maximum signal for the maps integrated over 52 km s@xmath15 were 0.025 jy beam@xmath15 and 0.12 jy beam@xmath15 for ngc  5461 , and 0.022 jy beam@xmath15 and 0.09 jy beam@xmath15 for ngc  5462 . the rms noise and the maximum signal for the 1 mhz channel maps were 0.10 jy beam@xmath15 and 0.36 jy beam@xmath15 for ngc  5461 , and 0.10 jy beam@xmath15 and 0.33 jy beam@xmath15 for ngc  5462 .",
    "once the cleaning process was completed , we identified candidate gmcs in the maps .",
    "three different types of plots were used .",
    "the _ integrated map _ is a plot that has been integrated over a wide velocity range ( 52 km s@xmath15 ) to include all the emission .",
    "the _ channel maps _ are a series of maps where the region is plotted by integrating over one channel only ( 2.6 km s@xmath15 ) .",
    "finally , the _ optimum map _ for each cloud is integrated only over the velocity range in which a given feature is visible at the @xmath44 level or better .",
    "it must be stated in no uncertain terms that the process of identifying gmcs is fairly subjective .",
    "we have chosen three relatively conservative criteria so that the results inspire some confidence . the first criterion used to identify",
    "the gmcs is that the feature should be at least @xmath45 in the integrated map .",
    "the second criterion required features to persist at the @xmath44 level over two consecutive channels ; this method , however , could result in underestimating the number of clouds , especially the ones with a narrow velocity width .",
    "the best velocity range for each gmc candidate was determined from the channel maps , and for each feature , the optimum map integrated for the appropriate velocity range was generated .",
    "the third criterion required the feature to have signal of at least @xmath44 in the optimum map .",
    "it is possible for the second criterion to be satisfied but not the third if the features drift slightly from channel - to - channel so that the ` optimum ' integrated flux is less than 3@xmath46 above the noise .",
    "the integrated map of ngc  5461 ( figure  [ fig:61int ] ) has thirty - three features with peak fluxes of at least @xmath45 .",
    "of the thirty - three features that appear in the integrated map , nine can be seen at the @xmath44 level in two consecutive channels of the channel maps .",
    "in addition , we have also considered two other features ( 4 and 6 in figure  [ fig:61int ] ) that appear on the integrated map and in three consecutive channels at the @xmath45 level . of the eleven gmc candidates ,",
    "one is eliminated by the third criterion , i.e. , the total flux in the optimum map is not three times higher than the noise of the optimum map .",
    "the rms noise determined in the optimum maps varies between @xmath47 jy beam@xmath15 depending on the number of channels over which the signal has been integrated .",
    "the characteristics of the ten gmcs are given in table  [ tab : ovro_gma ] .",
    "the positions were determined from the optimum maps .",
    "the sizes are not deconvolved from the synthesized beam ; no cloud appears significantly larger than the beam in both dimensions , and thus we can only place upper limits on the true size of the clouds .",
    "the cloud positions are given for the center of the peak of the gmc in terms of offsets from the field center with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath48 .",
    "two features , clouds  7 and 10 , have similar coordinates , but they are separated in velocity space .",
    "table  [ tab : ovro_gma ] also includes the integrated flux measured from the optimum map .",
    "we calculated the equivalent brightness temperature , @xmath49 , by multiplying the peak flux in a one channel map by the conversion factor from janskys to kelvin ( 17.34 k / jy ) .",
    "these brightness temperatures ( 4.5  8.1 k ) are larger than those found in the gmcs toward m33 @xcite despite the fact that the gmcs in m33 are resolved and much closer .",
    "these large brightness temperatures suggest that the gmcs in m101 are close to being resolved .",
    "the emission from ngc  5462 is much weaker than that from ngc  5461 ; in fact , the emission is so much weaker that there are no features that appear in consecutive channels at the @xmath44 level .",
    "if all the positive features are added , then the upper limit to the total flux from the region is @xmath50 jy km s@xmath15 .",
    "the column density can be calculated via an empirical relation based on data that suggest that the column density of hydrogen , @xmath51 , is linearly proportional to the observed radiation temperature integrated over the emission line of @xmath5co @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "we have more confidence in the universality of the virial theorem and , thus , this large discrepancy suggests that a smaller value of @xmath1 for the giant hii  regions in m101 is more appropriate .",
    "the physical justification for adopting a different value of @xmath1 is that @xmath1 depends on temperature , and the observed high brightness temperature indicates that the gas is hot .",
    "if these clouds obey the galactic size : line - width relation , they have rather low filling factors within the ovro beam and their true brightness temperatures would be even higher than what is observed .",

    "there are two extreme non - lte approaches in dealing with the radiative transfer problem .",
    "one approach is to assume that there is no global motion : all the emission is a result of small - scale thermal motions and turbulence .",
    "the second approach is to assume that the gas cloud has a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) , which means that the co emission from one part of the cloud will be doppler - shifted to a frequency that will not be re - absorbed by gas in other parts of the cloud @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the emission from a molecule will only be absorbed by neighboring molecules , and the radiative transfer can be solved locally @xcite .",
    "the first approach is called the microturbulence method , and the second approach is called the lvg method .",
    "the two non - lte approaches typically produce results that agree within the errors of the methods , which are a factor of three due to uncertainties in geometry @xcite . we have used just one non - lte method , the lvg method , to compare with our lte analysis @xcite .",
    "to estimate the physical conditions in the gmcs of m101 , we have used the lvg code written by jessica arlett and lorne avery for a spherical , uniform cloud .",
    "this program computes the radiation temperatures of various co transitions for ranges of kinetic temperature , density of h@xmath0 , and an abundance parameter , which is defined as @xmath116 .",
    "these radiation temperatures were fitted to the observed values ( table  [ tab : ratios ] ) by minimizing a @xmath117 statistic to give the best fit for kinetic temperature , density , and abundance .",
    "in addition to these parameters , the lvg results depend on the isotopomer ratio , @xmath118[@xmath5co]/[@xmath22co ] .",
    "we found that the best fits occur for @xmath108 , which is in agreement with the observed value in the milky way @xcite .    for ngc  5461 ,",
    "we found reasonable fits both for low temperatures ( @xmath119 k ) and for high temperatures ( @xmath120 k ) ; the best fit was for @xmath121 k. however , the best fit for density , @xmath122 @xmath123 , was the same for both ranges of temperature .",
    "a gmc with diameter 112 pc and this density has a mass of @xmath124 , which is two orders of magnitude larger than those obtained with the empirical method ( table  [ tab : ansummary ] ) .",
    "the clouds are not resolved , and we do not expect the cloud to be completely uniform : the volume - averaged density is usually substantially smaller than @xmath125 @xmath123 @xcite . by comparing the results from the lvg analysis and the empirical method ,",
    "we conclude that the filling factor is on the order of 1% for the clumpy material .",
    "this low filling - factor indicates that the gas emitting the co has formed dense clumps , which are surrounded by a lower density envelope .",
    "a similar situation is observed in the molecular gas of 30 doradus @xcite : the intense radiation field is considered the reason for the dissociation or ionization of the gas in the envelope .",
    "the lvg analysis can not be done for ngc  5462 because there are only two available ratios ( table  [ tab : ratios ] ) .",
    "the lvg analysis is not conclusive with only two ratios @xcite , but one can use the available ratios to make some general statements about the physical properties of the gas . because the @xmath5co ( @xmath126)/(@xmath85 ) ratio for ngc  5462 is larger than that of ngc  5461 , the molecular gas in ngc  5462 may be warmer than the molecular gas around ngc  5461 . [ a : tempratio ]",
    "one expects from the boltzmann equation that , for usual temperatures of quiescent molecular gas ( 10 k ) , the second level is more populated than the third level , which means that for cold gas the ratio @xmath5co ( @xmath126)/(@xmath85 ) is less than unity ; however , in the case of ngc  5462 , the ratio is larger than unity , which implies that the gas is probably considerably hotter than typical quiescent gas .",
    "ngc  5461 is the brightest hii  region in co emission ; therefore , the data set for ngc  5461 is the most complete of all the giant hii  regions in m101 .",
    "there are two estimates ( from the lte and from the empirical estimate using the nrao data ) for the mass of the association of gmcs in ngc  5461 , which range in value from ( @xmath127 .",
    "although the discrepancy of a factor of 3 is not surprising when we consider the uncertainties in the methods involved , the difference could be partially due to an underestimate of @xmath128 ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is likely that there are gmcs in ngc  5461 that were not detected and would have contributed in increasing the coupling efficiency .",
    "both the lte method and the empirical method suggest that ngc  5462 has roughly an order of magnitude less molecular mass than ngc  5461 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the fact that the molecular gas in ngc  5462 was not detected with the owens valley array .",
    "ngc  5462 might not be as massive as ngc  5461 , but it may be hotter than ngc  5461 since the @xmath5co ( @xmath126)/(@xmath85 ) ratio in ngc  5462 is even higher than the extraordinary cloud ngc  604 - 2 in m33 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty of this ratio for ngc  5462 is fairly high ; within its uncertainty , it agrees with normal clouds in m33 and ic10 @xcite .",
    "ngc  5471 [ s : def71 ] is significantly weaker in co emission than ngc  5462 and ngc  5461 , so the only observations that were made of ngc  5471 were in @xmath5co @xmath28and @xmath129 emission .",
    "unlike ngc  5462 , ngc  5471 is several kpc away from the center of m101 and , therefore , has considerably lower metallicity than regions closer to the center of m101 . with the higher adopted value for @xmath1 for this region ,",
    "the upper limit to the molecular mass in ngc  5471 is comparable to that of ngc  5462 .",
    "if the @xmath1 factor is in fact even larger , then the mass of the molecular gas in ngc  5471 could even be comparable to that of ngc  5461 .",
    "however , a more probable explanation for the deficiency of co emission in ngc  5471 is that there is genuinely less molecular gas present .",
    "a clue to this problem is the presence of large amounts of atomic gas near the giant hii  region @xcite .",
    "perhaps the atomic gas was converted to molecular gas more slowly in ngc  5471 than in the other two giant hii  regions , or perhaps more of the molecular gas has been rapidly dissociated to atomic gas .",
    "there is more discussion on this topic in ",
    "[ s : star ] .",
    "one possible result of star formation is that the molecular gas becomes hotter .",
    "one of the diagnostics of high temperatures is the @xmath5co ( @xmath126)/(@xmath85 ) ratio .",
    "ngc  5461 has a similar @xmath5co ( @xmath126)/(@xmath85 ) ratio to the clouds in m33 that are associated with hii  regions @xcite .",
    "however , the ratio for ngc  5461 does not approach the value for the gmc ngc  604 - 2 , which is , indeed , very high compared to other ratios seen in m33 and other galaxies .",
    "an explanation for the lower value of the @xmath5co ( @xmath126)/(@xmath85 ) ratio in ngc  5461 compared to that found in other giant hii  regions is that the clouds in ngc  5461 may have a mixture of warm and hot gas .",
    "the dominant warm component could be similar in temperature and density to the gmcs in m33 associated with hii  regions @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to understand the connection between the molecular gas in m101 and the existence of the bright stars that produce the giant hii  regions . in the milky way , the masses of gmcs that are affiliated with ob associations are ( 1  7)@xmath130  @xcite . from this observational result ,",
    "williams and mckee @xcite suggest that the probability a gmc will contain a very bright massive star ( o9.5 ) increases as the mass of the cloud increases .",
    "however , the gmcs in ngc  5461 have masses that are much smaller than those required to form many bright o stars according to fig . 7 of williams and mckee @xcite .",
    "perhaps the star - forming efficiency , and not the mass of the clouds , is the key issue for regions with intense star formation .",
    "intense star formation influences and is influenced by the surrounding ambient ionized and atomic gas .",
    "it is instructive to consider the correlation of molecular gas with ionized and atomic gas .",
    "one might expect that molecular and ionized hydrogen , which is observed via the h@xmath131 transition , should be associated with each other . in figure",
    "[ fig : halpha ] , the co peaks are compared with a recent h@xmath131 map that was kindly provided by robert c. kennicutt .",
    "the co clouds are denoted by stars to distinguish them from the contours of the h@xmath131 map .",
    "the co peaks are typically displaced from the peak of the h@xmath131 image by @xmath132 or , at the distance of m101 , @xmath133 pc .",
    "a possible reason , which was used to explain the same type of anticorrelation in m51 @xcite , is that the presence of gas with high surface density increases the extinction from the associated dust .",
    "the radiation from the ionized gas is obstructed , and therefore the h@xmath131 emission is anticorrelated with the molecular gas .",
    "figure  [ fig : hi ] presents the co clouds in ngc  5461 superimposed on a high resolution ( @xmath134 ) hi  contour map kindly provided by robert braun .",
    "the gmcs are denoted with stars .",
    "the co peaks are displaced compared to the peak of the hi  image by @xmath135 or , at the distance of m101 , @xmath136 pc .",
    "a possible explanation for this displacement is that the radiation from the young massive stars in the hii  regions may have dissociated the molecular gas to atomic gas ; this explanation was used for m51 where a similar displacement was observed @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty of the positions of the hi  map , @xmath137 , is fairly high ; it is possible that the observed offset is not significant .",
    "a large scale study of the atomic gas in m101 was conducted with @xmath138 resolution @xcite .",
    "two of the several positions observed coincide with the giant hii  regions ngc  5461 and ngc  5471 .",
    "the atomic masses for the two regions are @xmath139  and @xmath140 , respectively , which are a few times higher than the corresponding molecular mass observed in similar beams .",
    "this result is consistent with the observed ratios of atomic to molecular gas in a sample of 27 sc galaxies @xcite .    despite the fact that the masses of the atomic gas for ngc  5461 and ngc  5471 are similar , their empirical _ molecular _ masses are different by a factor of 3 . why does ngc  5461 have so much more molecular gas than ngc  5471 ?",
    "one possibility is that ngc  5461 has a more efficient mechanism to convert atomic to molecular gas than ngc  5471 does .",
    "the efficiency of the conversion might be enhanced by large - scale gravitational effects that increase gas interactions and remove loosely bound atomic gas @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the star - formation mechanism in ngc  5471 has had more time to dissociate the molecular gas ( to form atomic gas ) by the intense radiation from the young stars @xcite . unfortunately , the available data are not sufficient to find the relative ages of the giant hii  regions in order to distinguish between the two possibilities .",
    "the sum of the masses of the molecular , ionized , and the atomic gas for both regions ( table  [ tab : efficiencies ] ) is in fair agreement with the total gas mass calculated from the dust and the assumed gas - to - dust ratio .",

    "the flux at 60 @xmath141 m for ngc  5461 is 9.65 jy , and for ngc  5471 is 1.81 jy ( ngc  5462 is not detected as a point source ) . for the calculation",

    "the dust mass for ngc  5461 is @xmath151  while for ngc  5471 the dust mass is @xmath152 .",
    "if the gas - to - dust ratio is assumed to be a typical value of 600 for sc  galaxies [ young and scoville @xcite and references therein ] , then the total gas mass in ngc  5461 is @xmath153 , and the total gas mass in ngc  5471 is @xmath154 , which is in agreement with the sum of all gas components in these regions ( table  [ tab : efficiencies ] ) .",
    "the star - formation efficiency is the ratio of the mass of stars formed in the region to the sum of the stellar and molecular masses of the region @xcite .",
    "recently , the mass of stars ( @xmath155 ) in a small portion of ngc  5461 has been estimated from uv fluxes @xcite ; however , to compare this result with our data , we must scale the mass of stars to include all stars down to 0.1 , and we must scale the flux to correct for the small aperture used ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "we estimate that the first scale factor is 2.6 from table 9 in miller and scalo @xcite , and the second scale factor is 4 for both ngc  5461 and ngc  5471 from figure 1 in rosa and benvenuti @xcite .",
    "the masses of the stars and the star formation efficiencies in ngc  5461 and ngc  5471 calculated in this manner are given in table  [ tab : efficiencies ] .",
    "the star forming efficiencies are slightly larger than the efficiencies of a few percent ( 1% @xmath157 4% ) observed in several clouds in the milky way such as the taurus - auriga , orion a , and orion b clouds @xcite .",
    "thus , the gmcs in these giant hii  regions are somewhat more efficient in creating stars than molecular clouds in our galaxy .",
    "perhaps the mass of the atomic gas should be included in the calculation of the star efficiency if the molecular gas has already been dissociated to hi .",
    "however , the hi   has been found at great distances from the molecular cloud especially in the case of ngc  5471 .",
    "it is not obvious that the hi  is directly connected with the star forming regions .",

    "the mass of the gmcs in ngc  5461 was calculated empirically and from the virial theorem , and we found that the appropriate @xmath1 factor toward the giant hii  regions is 5 times smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "these data provide the first empirical demonstration that the value of @xmath1 may decrease in regions with intense star formation .",
    "the corrected empirical masses of the large gmcs cover a range of @xmath158  , which is comparable to that observed in the galaxy . using this determined value of @xmath1 , we calculate the mass of the associations of gmcs in ngc  5461 , ngc  5462 , and ngc  5471 .",
    "\\(2 ) the molecular mass for the association of gmcs in ngc  5461 is calculated to be @xmath159 .",
    "the higher value in the range comes from the lte analysis , while the lower value comes from the empirical method using nrao data of ngc  5461 .",
    "the discrepancy would be resolved if the @xmath128 was larger .",
    "this efficiency probably is larger because there could be more gmcs in ngc  5461 that were not detected .",
    "the interferometric data provide a lower mass ( @xmath160 ) because the flux from extended low - level emission is typically lost in an interferometer .",

    "co emission was not detected toward ngc  5471 ; the upper limit to the mass is @xmath162 .",
    "\\(3 ) the gas emitting the co is very dense , so dense that it can not fill up more than 1% of the volume without exceeding the gmc mass limits .",
    "it is possible that the intense radiation field in the vicinity of a giant hii  region partially dissociates or ionizes portions of the molecular gas leaving small dense cores in large sparse envelopes .",
    "\\(4 ) the molecular mass of the ngc  5461 association of clouds is accompanied by 12 times as much atomic mass .",
    "the fairly large ratio of atomic to molecular gas can be attributed either to slow formation of gmcs from the original atomic clouds or to efficient dissociation of the gmcs to atomic gas .",
    "an even stronger presence of atomic hydrogen is observed in the vicinity of ngc  5471 ; in this region , the atomic mass is an order of magnitude larger than molecular mass .",
    "perhaps ngc  5471 has not converted much of its atomic gas to molecular gas yet , or the molecular gas has been dissociated to form atomic gas .",
    "for both ngc  5461 and ngc  5471 , the total gas mass can be extrapolated from the mass of the dust estimated from iras data .",
    "the estimates of the total gas mass from the dust are consistent with the sum of the molecular , ionized , and atomic masses .",
    "\\(5 ) the relatively normal masses observed toward the clouds in ngc  5461 reinforce the hypothesis that giant hiiregions in m101 are so much brighter than the hii  regions in our galaxy because of the different properties of the natal clouds in m101 .",
    "in particular , this paper suggests that the high star - formation efficiency of the gas , and not the large mass of the cloud , is the key to the formation of giant hii  regions in m101 .",

    "<S> the molecular components of three giant hii  regions ( ngc  5461 , ngc  5462 , ngc  5471 ) in the galaxy m101 are investigated with new observations from single dish telescopes ( james clerk maxwell telescope and the nrao 12-meter ) and from the owens valley millimeter array . </S>",

    "<S> we calculate preliminary values for the molecular mass of the gmcs in ngc  5461 by assuming a co - to - h@xmath0 factor ( @xmath1 factor ) and then compare these values with the virial masses . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the appropriate @xmath1 factor is 5 times smaller than the @xmath1 factor in the milky way despite the lower metallicity of m101 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the data in this paper demonstrate for the first time that the value of @xmath1 may decrease in regions with intense star formation .    </S>",
    "<S> the molecular mass for the _ association _ of clouds in ngc  5461 is approximately @xmath2  and is accompanied by 12 times as much atomic mass . </S>",
    "<S> the observed co emission in ngc  5461 is an order of magnitude stronger than in ngc  5462 , while it was not possible to detect molecular gas toward ngc  5471 with the jcmt . an even larger ratio of atomic to molecular gas in ngc  5471 was observed , which might be attributed to efficient conversion of molecular to atomic gas .    </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the _ individual _ clouds in ngc  5461 , which are gravitationally bound , cover a range of ( @xmath3 , comparable with the masses of galactic giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> higher star forming efficiencies , and not massive clouds , appear to be the prerequisite for the formation of the large number of stars whose radiation is required to produce the giant hii  regions in m101 .    </S>",
