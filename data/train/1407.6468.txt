    "formation and evolution processes of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) and interstellar dust in galaxies can be strongly coupled , because the surface of dust grains can be the major formation sites of @xmath0 ( e.g. , gould & salpeter 1963 ; hollenbach & salpeter 1971 ) .",
    "dust has long been considered to play decisive roles in several aspects of star and galaxy formation , such as radiative cooling processes in star - forming clouds ( e.g. , herbst 2001 ) and the formation of metal - poor low - mass stars in the early universe ( e.g. , schneider & omukai 2010 ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath0 is an essential element in giant molecular clouds where star formation is ongoing ( e.g. , blitz et al .",
    "2007 ; fukui & kawamura 2010 ) and its physical properties ( e.g. , mass densities ) are key parameters for the observed star - formation laws in galaxies ( e.g. , bigiel et al .",
    "2008 ; leroy et al .",
    "thus , the better understanding of the formation and evolution processes of _ both _ dust and @xmath0 in ism can lead to the deeper understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in general .    physical properties of @xmath0 have long been investigated for galaxies with different hubble types ( e.g. , young & scoville 1991 , ys91 ; boselli et al . 2014 ) , in different environments ( e.g. , leon et al . 1998 ; wilson et al .",
    "2009 ) , and at different redshifts ( e.g. , daddi eta l. 2010 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ; bauermeister et al .",
    "2013 ) , and their origins have not been clarified yet .",
    "recent extensive observational studies on h  i and @xmath0 properties of galaxies and their correlations of galaxy parameters for a large number of galaxy samples have provided valuable information on scaling relations of gas and stars and thus new constraints on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "( e.g. , catinella et al .",
    "2010 ; saintonge et al .",
    "2011 ) . resolved structures and kinematics of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in nearby galaxies such as m31 , m33 , and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have enabled astronomers to reveal the physical factors for the conversion from h  i to @xmath0 and the possible typical lifetime of gmcs in galaxies ( e.g. , blitz et al .",
    "2007 ; fukui & kawamura 2010 ) .    in spite of these observational progresses , a number of key long - standing problems on @xmath0 properties of galaxy have not been resolved yet . among them",
    "is the origin of the diverse @xmath0 properties along the hubble sequence ( e.g. , ys91 ) .",
    "it is well known that the mass - ratio of @xmath0 to h  i ( referred to as @xmath7 ) is quite diverse ( more than two orders of magnitudes ) for a given hubble type and it is systematically higher in early - type disk galaxies ( ys91 ) .",
    "this diverse @xmath0 properties along the hubble sequence has been confirmed in the latest observations with a larger number of galaxy samples ( e.g. , boselli et al .",
    "it is theoretically unclear what global galaxy parameters ( e.g. , bulge - to - disk - ratios ) can determine the observed @xmath0-to - h  i - ratios ( @xmath7 ) in galaxies .",
    "furthermore , one of other unresolved problems is related to the observed radial distributions of @xmath0 in galaxies and their correlations with stellar parameters of galaxies ( e.g. , blitz et al .",
    "wong & blitz ( 2002 ) showed that the ratio of @xmath0 to h  i surface density in a galaxy depends on the projected distance ( @xmath10 ) from the galactic center such that it can be best fit to @xmath8 ( or @xmath11 , see their fig .",
    "some early - type spirals ( e.g. , m31 ) are observed to have intriguing ring - like structures ( e.g. , ys91 ) .",
    "recent observations have revealed that the mass - ratio of @xmath0 to stars ( @xmath12 ) is quite different between galaxies with different hubble types and even within a same type ( e.g. , boselli et al .",
    "these observations have not been explained clearly by previous theoretical studies of galaxy formation and evolution , though they would have some profound implications on galaxy formation .",
    "recent significant progresses in observational studies of @xmath0 properties of galaxies with different types at different @xmath13 appear to have triggered extensive theoretical and numerical studies of of @xmath0 formation in galaxies .",
    "for example , recent numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution have incorporated the conversion of @xmath14 formation from h  i on dust grains ( e.g. , pelupessy et al .",
    "2006 , p06 ; robertson & kravtsov 2008 , gnedin et al . 2009 ; christensen et al . 2012",
    "; kuhlen et al .",
    "2012 ; thompson et al .",
    "recent semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , fu et al . 2010 ; lagos et al . 2012 )",
    "adopted the @xmath14 formation model dependent gaseous metallicities and densities proposed by krumholz , mckee & tumlinson ( 2009 ) and thereby investigated the time evolution of @xmath14 contents in galaxies .",
    "however , these previous numerical studies of galaxy formation and evolution with @xmath0 formation have not incorporated the evolution of dust ( e.g. , abundances and masses ) explicitly in their models , and accordingly could not discuss the importance of the _ joint _ evolution of dust and @xmath0 .",
    "it is ideal for any theoretical studies of @xmath0 formation in galaxies to include the formation and evolution processes of both dust and @xmath0 in a self - consistent manner , because their evolution can be strongly coupled through star formation .",
    "given that recent observational studies have revealed a number of important correlations between dust and @xmath0 properties in galaxies ( e.g. , corbelli et al .",
    "2012 ) , it would be essential for theoretical studies of @xmath0 formation in galaxies to incorporate a model for the formation and evolution of dust in ism .",
    "our previous studies constructed a new chemodynamical model that includes both the @xmath0 formation on dust grains and the formation and destruction of dust in ism in a self - consistent manner ( bekki 2013a , 2014 ; b13a and b14 , respectively , yozin & bekki 2014a ) .",
    "they therefore could discuss the time evolution of dust and @xmath0 properties in galaxies at their formation epochs .",
    "however , they did not discuss how the physical properties of @xmath0 in galaxies can possibly depend on their global parameters such as their total masses and hubble types .",
    "therefore , the following three questions are unresolved : ( i ) what can drive the observed diversity in @xmath0 properties between different galaxies , ( ii ) whether and how dust can play a role in controlling @xmath0 properties of galaxies , and ( iii ) what is responsible for the observed @xmath0-dust correlations in galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper are two - fold as follows .",
    "first , we investigate whether the adopted model of @xmath0 formation self - consistently including dust evolution can explain the observed fundamental properties of @xmath0 in galaxies . in this first investigation",
    ", we focus particularly on the observed correlations between mass - ratios of @xmath0 to h  i and other galaxy parameters ( e.g. , wong & blitz 2002 ; blitz & rosolowsy 2006 , blitz et al . 2007 ) .",
    "second , we investigate how the physical properties of @xmath0 in galaxies depend on the total halo masses ( @xmath2 ) , baryonic mass fractions ( @xmath3 ) , gas mass fractions ( @xmath4 ) , hubble types ( e.g. , bulge - to - disk - ratios , @xmath15 ) , and the formation redshifts of galaxies by using mainly isolated models of disk and dwarf galaxies .",
    "we also try to understand how galaxy interaction can influence the time evolution of global @xmath0 properties of galaxies in this second investigation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe some details of the chemodynamical model with the formation and evolution of dust and @xmath14 adopted by the present study in  2 .",
    "we present the numerical results on the physical correlations between @xmath0 properties and galaxy parameters ( e.g. , masses ) in disk galaxies in  3 . in this section",
    ", we also discuss the dependences of the results on the adopted model parameters . in  4 , we discuss the latest observational results on @xmath14 properties of galaxies and provides some implications of some key results derived in this paper .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  5 .    in the present",
    ", we do not discuss the latest results from @xmath16 ( atacama large millimeter array ) , such as the molecular outflow driven by agn ( e.g. , combes et al . 2014 ) and total ism masses probed by dust emission in 107 galaxies from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( scoville et al .",
    "2014 ) . these new observational results will be addressed by our future works with a more sophisticated chemodynamical model with @xmath0 formation .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]",
    "we adopt our new simulation code recently developed in our previous works ( b13a and b14 ) in order to investigate spatial and temporal variations of @xmath0 in disk galaxies with different masses and hubble - types .",
    "the adopted code can be run on gpu - based machines ( clusters ) , where gravitational calculations can be done on gpus whereas other calculations ( e.g. , star formation and hydrodynamics ) can be done on cpus .",
    "the code adopts the smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method for following the time evolution of gas dynamics in galaxies .",
    "the present simulations include the formation of dust grains in the stellar winds of supernovae ( sne ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , the time evolution of interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , the growth and destruction processes of dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the @xmath0 formation on dust grains , and the @xmath0 photo - dissociation due to far ultra - violet ( fuv ) light in a self - consistent manner .",
    "although we can investigate the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) dust in carbon - rich agb stars and the time evolution of dust by using the simulation code , we do not extensively investigate the dust properties in the present study .",
    "instead , we briefly discuss the possible physical correlations between dust and @xmath0 properties in disk galaxies .",
    "the new simulation code does not include the effects of feedback of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on ism and the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galaxies so that we can not investigate how the feedback can change the spatial distributions and mass budgets of dust and @xmath0 in galaxies .",
    "although it is an important issue whether and how the agn feedback effects can influence the dust properties of ism and thus the @xmath0 contents , we will discuss this in our future papers .",
    "the new code allows us to choose whether some physical effects ( e.g. , dust formation etc ) are included or excluded ( i.e. , switched on or off ) so that we can investigate how the physical effects are important in the evolution of gas and stars in galaxies .",
    "accordingly , we summarize the physical effects that are included in the present study in table 1 for clarity .",
    "since the major formation site of @xmath0 in ism is the surface of dust grains , it is crucial for any theoretical study on @xmath0 evolution of galaxies to properly investigate the time evolution of dust abundances in disk galaxies . given that both observational and theoretical studies have shown that dust - to - metal - ratios can be diverse ( e.g. , hirashita 1999 ; galametz et al .",
    "2011 ) , we need to refrain from deriving dust abundances from metallicities by assuming constant dust - to - metal - ratios .",
    "the present code indeed enables us to investigate the time evolution of different dust components in galaxies so that we can more properly predict the time evolution of @xmath0 in galaxies .",
    "we mainly focus on isolated disk galaxies composed of dark matter halo , stellar disk , stellar bulge , and gaseous disk : some new results on @xmath0 properties in forming galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath13 ) are discussed in b14 . since",
    "the details of the physical models for the formation and evolution of dust and @xmath0 are given in b13 and b14 , we briefly describe the models in the present paper .        the total masses of dark matter halo , stellar disk , gas disk , and bulge of a disk galaxy are denoted as @xmath2 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the total disk mass ( gas + stars ) and gas mass fraction are denoted as @xmath22 and @xmath4 , respectively , for convenience . the mass ratio of the disk ( @xmath23 ) to the dark matter halo ( @xmath2 ) in a disk galaxy is a ` baryonic mass fraction ' and denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "the bulge - to - disk - ratio is defined as @xmath24 and represented by a parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the four key parameters in the present study are @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath15 .    in order to describe the initial density profile of dark matter halo in a disk galaxy",
    ", we adopt the density distribution of the nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) suggested from cdm simulations : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the spherical radius , the characteristic density of a dark halo , and the scale length of the halo , respectively .",
    "the @xmath29-parameter ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the virial radius of a dark matter halo ) and @xmath31 are chosen appropriately for a given dark halo mass ( @xmath32 ) by using the @xmath33 relation for @xmath34 and 2 predicted by recent cosmological simulations ( e.g. , neto et al . 2007 ; mu@xmath35oz - cuartas et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the bulge of a disk galaxy has a size of @xmath36 and a scale - length of @xmath37 and is represented by the hernquist density profile .",
    "the bulge is assumed to have isotropic velocity dispersion and the radial velocity dispersion is given according to the jeans equation for a spherical system .",
    "the bulge - to - disk ratio ( @xmath38 ) of a disk galaxy is a free parameter ranging from 0 ( pure disk galaxy ) to 4 ( bulge - dominated ) .",
    "the ` mw - type ' models are those with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the stellar disk size of a galaxy .",
    "we adopt the mass - size scaling relation of @xmath42 for bulges so that we can determine @xmath36 for a given @xmath21 .",
    "the value of @xmath43 is determined so that @xmath36 can be 3.5 kpc for @xmath44 ( corresponding to the mass and size of the mw s bulge ) .",
    "the radial ( @xmath10 ) and vertical ( @xmath45 ) density profiles of the stellar disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath46 with scale length @xmath47 and to @xmath48 with scale length @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the gas disk with a size @xmath50 has the radial and vertical scale lengths of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . in the present model for the mw - type , the exponential disk has @xmath53 kpc and @xmath54 kpc .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity caused by the gravitational field of disk , bulge , and dark halo components , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersions are assigned to the disc component according to the epicyclic theory with toomre s parameter @xmath55 = 1.5 .",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion at a given radius is set to be 0.5 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point .",
    "the total numbers of particles used for dark matter halo ( @xmath56 ) , stellar disk ( @xmath57 ) , and gaseous disk ( @xmath58 ) in a simulation are 700000 , 200000 , and 100000 respectively .",
    "the total number of particle for bulge is @xmath59 , which means that @xmath60 for the mw - type disk galaxy model with @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the big bulge model with @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the total number of particles is @xmath64 for the fiducial mw - type model and @xmath65 for the big bulge model .",
    "the gravitational softening length for each component is determined by the number of particle used for each component and by the size of the distribution ( e.g. , @xmath41 and @xmath31 ) and the value is described later .",
    "observations have shown that ( i ) there is a mass - metallicity relation in disk galaxies ( e.g. , tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) and ( ii ) most of disk galaxies show negative metallicity gradients ( i.e. , higher metallicity in inner regions ) with the slopes being different in different galaxies ( e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "we therefore determine the initial mean metallicity of the gas disk in a galaxy according to the observe mass - metallicity relation for the adopted total halo mass ( @xmath2 ) and gas mass fraction for the galaxy .",
    "for example , a mw - type disk galaxy with @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 ( corresponding to the fiducial model later described ) can have [ fe / h]=0 .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity of each ( gaseous and stellar ) particle is given according to its initial position : at @xmath26 = @xmath10 , where @xmath26 ( @xmath10 ) is the projected distance ( in units of kpc ) from the center of the disk , the metallicity of the star is given as : @xmath69}_{\\rm r = r } = { \\rm [ fe / h]}_{\\rm d , r=0 } + \\alpha \\times { \\rm r}. \\,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the slope of the metallicity gradient in units of dex kpc@xmath71 . since the present results on global properties of @xmath0 do not depend on @xmath70 , we mainly show the results of the models with @xmath72 .",

    "second , the stellar disk size of a galaxy at @xmath13 ( @xmath41 ) is @xmath77 times larger than that at @xmath34 ( @xmath78 )",
    ". therefore the mean density of a dark matter halo in a disk galaxy at @xmath34 is as follows ; @xmath79 where @xmath80 for a given @xmath2 .",
    "the stellar disk size is given as follows : @xmath81 which means that the size ratio of @xmath31 to @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "for example , @xmath29 and @xmath31 for a disk galaxy with @xmath66 at @xmath34 are 10 and 245kpc , respectively , whereas they are 4.5 and 82 kpc at @xmath83 .",
    "the simulated dark matter halos are assumed to have a scaling relation of @xmath84 at @xmath34 and 2 .",
    "since sf can proceed in molecular clouds , we adopt the following ` @xmath0-dependent ' sf recipe ( b13a ) using molecular gas fraction ( @xmath1 ) defined for each gas particle in the present study .",
    "a gas particle _ can be _ converted into a new star if ( i ) the local dynamical time scale is shorter than the sound crossing time scale ( mimicking the jeans instability ) , ( ii ) the local velocity field is identified as being consistent with gravitationally collapsing ( i.e. , div * v*@xmath85 ) , and ( iii ) the local density exceeds a threshold density for star formation ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we mainly investigate the models with @xmath87 @xmath88 in the present study .",
    "a gas particle can be regarded as a ` sf candidate ' gas particle if the above three sf conditions ( i)-(iii ) are satisfied .",
    "it could be possible to convert some fraction ( @xmath89 ) of a sf candidate gas particle into a new star at each time step until the mass of the gas particle becomes very small .",
    "however , this sf conversion method can increase dramatically the total number of stellar particles , which becomes numerically very costly .",
    "we therefore adopt the following sf conversion method .",
    "a sf candidate @xmath90-th gas particle is regarded as having a sf probability ( @xmath91 ) ; @xmath92 where @xmath93 corresponds to a star formation efficiency ( sfe ) in molecular cores and is set to be 1 , @xmath94 is the time step width for the gas particle , @xmath95 is the gas density of the particle , and @xmath96 is the power - law slope of the kennicutt - schmidt law ( sfr@xmath97 ; kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "a reasonable value of @xmath98 is adopted in the present study .",
    "this sf probability has been already introduced in our early chemodynamical simulations of galaxies ( e.g. , bekki & shioya 1998 ) .    at each time step random numbers ( @xmath99 ; @xmath100 ) are generated and compared with @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath101 , then the gas particle can be converted into a new stellar one . in this sf recipe , a gas particle with a higher gas density and thus a shorter sf timescale ( @xmath102 ) can be more rapidly converted into a new star owing to the larger @xmath91 .",
    "equally , a gas particle with a higher @xmath1 can be more rapidly converted into a new star .",
    "we thus consider that the present sf model is a good approximation for star formation in molecular gas of disk galaxies .    each sn is assumed to eject the feedback energy ( @xmath103 ) of @xmath104 erg and 90% and 10% of @xmath103 are used for the increase of thermal energy ( ` thermal feedback ' ) and random motion ( ` kinematic feedback ' ) , respectively .",
    "the thermal energy is used for the ` adiabatic expansion phase ' , where each sn can remain adiabatic for a timescale of @xmath105 .",
    "although @xmath106 yr is reasonable for a single sn explosion , we adopt a much longer @xmath105 of @xmath107 yr .",
    "this is mainly because multiple sn explosions can occur for a gas particle with a mass of @xmath108 in these galaxy - scale simulations , and @xmath105 can be different for multiple sn explosions in a small local region owing to complicated interaction between gaseous ejecta from different sne .",
    "such interaction of multiple sn explosions would make the adiabatic phase significantly longer in real ism of galaxies .",
    "we adopt a canonical stellar initial mass function ( imf ) proposed by kroupa ( 2001 ) , which has three different slopes at different mass ranges .",
    "our recent study ( bekki 2013b , b13b ) has shown that if the imf depends on local physical properties of ism ( e.g. , gas density and metallicity ) , then galaxy evolution , in particular , the time evolution of @xmath0 and dust contents , can be significantly influenced by the time - varying imf . since the main purpose of this study is not to demonstrate how the @xmath0 contents of disk galaxies can be influenced by a time - varying imf , we assume that the imf is fixed at the adopted kroupa - imf in the present study .",
    "it is our future works to clarify the roles of time - varying imfs in controlling @xmath0 properties in galaxies with different masses and hubble types .",
    "since the present model for chemical enrichment processes of galaxies is exactly the same as that used in b13a , we briefly describe the model here .",
    "chemical enrichment through star formation and metal ejection from snia , ii , and agb stars is self - consistently included in the chemodynamical simulations .",
    "we investigate the time evolution of the 11 chemical elements of h , he , c , n , o , fe , mg , ca , si , s , and ba in order to predict both chemical abundances and dust properties in the present study . we consider the time delay between the epoch of star formation and those of supernova explosions and commencement of agb phases ( i.e. , non - instantaneous recycling of chemical elements ) .",
    "we adopt the ` prompt sn ia ' model in which the delay time distribution ( dtd ) of sne ia is consistent with recent observational results by extensive sn ia surveys ( e.g. , mannucci et al . 2006 ) . in this prompt sn ia mode , there is a time delay ( @xmath109 ) between the star formation and the metal ejection for sne ia and the range of @xmath109 is 0.1 gyr @xmath110 10 gyr . the fraction of the stars that eventually produce sne ia for 38@xmath111 has not been observationally determined . in the present study , @xmath112 is assumed .",

    "we consider that the key parameter in dust accretion is the dust accretion timescale ( @xmath115 ) . in the present study",
    ", this parameter can vary between different gas particles and is thus represented by @xmath116 for @xmath90th gas particle .",
    "the mass of @xmath113th component ( @xmath113=c , o , mg , si , s , ca , and fe ) of dust for @xmath90th gas particle at time @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) can increase owing to dust accretion processes .",
    "the mass increase is described as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the individual time step width for the @xmath90th gas particle and @xmath121 is the fraction of the @xmath113th chemical element that is locked up in the dust .",
    "owing to this dust growth , the mass of @xmath113th chemical component that is _ not _ locked up in the dust ( @xmath122 ) can decrease , which is simply given as @xmath123 as is clear in these equations , the total mass of @xmath113th component in @xmath90th gas particle ( @xmath124 ) is @xmath125 .",
    "dust grains can be destroyed though supernova blast waves in the ism of galaxies ( e.g. , mckee 1989 ) and the destruction process is parameterized by the destruction time scale ( @xmath126 ) in previous one - zone models ( e.g. , lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ; hirashita 1999 ) .",
    "following the previous models , the decrease of the mass of @xmath113th component of dust for @xmath90th gas particle at time @xmath117 due to dust destruction process is as follows @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the dust destruction timescale for @xmath90th particle .",
    "the dust destroyed by supernova explosions can be returned back to the ism , and therefore the mass of @xmath113th chemical component that is not locked up in the dust increases as follows : @xmath129    thus the equation for the time evolution of @xmath113th component of metals for @xmath90th gas particle are given as @xmath130 likewise , the equation for dust evolution is given as @xmath131 dust is locked up in stars as metals are done so , when gas particles are converted into new stars .",
    "we investigate the variable dust accretion ( vda ) model in which @xmath132 is different between different particles with different gaseous properties and changes with time according to the changes of gaseous properties .",
    "we need to introduce a few additional parameters in vda in order to describe the possible dependences of @xmath115 of gas particles on the gas densities , temperature , and chemical abundances .",

    "we therefore consider that @xmath145 should be adopted a reference value in the present dust model .    in the present study ,",
    "the dust - to - metal - ratio of a galaxy is defined as follows : @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the total amount of dust and metals in the galaxy , respectively .",
    "although the initial value of @xmath149 could be different in different galaxies , we mainly adopt the standard value of 0.4 ( corresponding to the value of the solar neighborhood ) and thereby investigate the evolution of dust and @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly discuss how the present results depend on the initial @xmath149 by changing @xmath149 from 0.1 to 0.4 .",
    "the model for @xmath0 formation and dissociation in the present study is exactly the same as those used in b13a : @xmath0 formation on dust grains and @xmath14 dissociation by fuv radiation are both self - consistently included in chemodynamical simulations . the temperature ( @xmath150 ) , hydrogen density ( @xmath151 ) , dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath133 ) of a gas particle and the strength of the fuv radiation field ( @xmath152 ) around the gas particle are calculated at each time step so that the fraction of molecular hydrogen ( @xmath1 ) for the gas particle can be derived based on the @xmath0 formation / destruction equilibrium conditions .",
    "thus the @xmath0 fraction for @xmath90-th gas particle ( @xmath153 ) is given as ; @xmath154 where @xmath155 means a function for @xmath153 determination .",
    "since the detail of the derivation methods of @xmath156 and @xmath153 ( thus @xmath155 ) are given in b13a and b13b , we here briefly describe the methods .",
    "the seds of stellar particles around each @xmath90-th gas particles ( thus isrf ) are first estimated from ages and metallicities of the stars by using stellar population synthesis codes for a given imf ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "then the strength of the fuv - part of the isrf is estimated from the seds so that @xmath156 can be derived for the @xmath90-th gas particle .",
    "based on @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 of the gas particle , we can derive @xmath153 ( see fig . 1 in b13a ) .",
    "thus each gas particle has @xmath153 , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and gas density , all of which are used for estimating the imf slopes for the particle ( when it is converted into a new star ) .",
    "the ages of stars ( @xmath159 ) are assumed to be 5 gyr and 2 gyr for the models with @xmath34 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the results of the present models are influenced by the choice of @xmath159 only for the very early - phase of disk evolution ( @xmath160 gyr ) , if @xmath159 is rather short ( @xmath161 gyr ) .",
    "the influences of @xmath159 is very limited , because the photodissociation of @xmath0 by stars can be very efficient when gas is surrounded by very young stars and thus irradiated by the strong uv - radiation fields .",
    "we therefore discuss only the results of the models with @xmath159 adopted above .",
    "a number of previous theoretical models of @xmath0 formation ( e.g. , hidaka & sofue 2002 ) adopted the phase transition theory proposed by elmegreen ( 1993 ) , in which h  i - to-@xmath0 transition in ism is determined basically by gas pressure and radiation field .",
    "elmegreen ( 1993 ) already showed that the observed @xmath0 mass function ( @xmath162 ) can be understood by his theory and also suggested that spiral density waves can convert h  i into @xmath0 .",
    "we do not adopt his phase transition theory but instead try to reproduce the observed @xmath0 properties using a different model based on @xmath0 formation on dust grains .",
    "one of key ingredients of the code is that the gravitational softening length ( @xmath163 ) is chosen for each component in a galaxy ( i.e. , multiple gravitational softening lengths ) .",
    "thus the gravitational softening length ( @xmath163 ) is different between dark matter ( @xmath164 ) and gas ( @xmath165 ) and @xmath164 is determined by the initial mean separation of dark matter particles .",
    "the gravitational softening length for stars ( @xmath166 ) is set to be the same as that for gas .",
    "initial @xmath165 is set to be significantly smaller than @xmath164 owing to rather high number - density of gas particles . the softening length for new stars formed from gas",
    "is set to be the same as @xmath165 .",
    "furthermore , when two different components interact gravitationally , the mean softening length for the two components is applied for the gravitational calculation .",
    "for example , @xmath167 is used for gravitational interaction between the values of @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( @xmath168 ) are 2.1 kpc and 0.2 kpc , respectively , for the fiducial mw - type disk model .",
    "we consider that the ism in galaxies can be modeled as an ideal gas with the ratio of specific heats ( @xmath169 ) being 5/3 . the gaseous temperature ( @xmath150 ) is set to be @xmath170 k initially in all models .",
    "the basic methods to implement sph in the present study are essentially the same as those proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) .",
    "we adopt the predictor - corrector algorithm ( that is accurate to second order in time and space ) in order to integrate the equations describing the time evolution of a system .",
    "each particle is allocated an individual time step width ( @xmath94 ) that is determined by physical properties of the particle . the maximum time step width ( @xmath171 )",
    "is @xmath172 in simulation units , which means that @xmath173 yr in the present study .",
    "although a gas particle is allowed to have a minimum time step width of @xmath174 yr in the adopted individual time step scheme , no particle actually has such a short time step width ( @xmath175 yr ) owing to conversion from gas to star in high - density gas regions .",
    "the radiative cooling processes are properly included by using the cooling curve by rosen & bregman ( 1995 ) for @xmath176k and the mapping iii code for @xmath177k ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .      in order to investigate how external tidal perturbation can influence the physical properties of @xmath0 in disk galaxies , we investigate tidal interaction models in which two disk galaxies strongly interact with each other .",

    ", we try to derive the @xmath0 surface density distribution ( h2sdd ) , which would be useful in discussing the origin of mcmfs of galaxies .",
    "we estimate the h2sdd in a disk galaxy as follows .",
    "we first divide the simulated stellar disk region ( @xmath53 kpc for the mw model ) of a disk galaxy into @xmath191 or @xmath192 small meshes and thereby estimate the total mass of @xmath0 ( @xmath193 ) .",

    "we mainly check whether the simulated slope of h2sdd can be similar to the observed slope of the galactic mcmf .",

    "i , @xmath0 , and dust evolve with time during the dynamical evolution of the gas disk with spiral arms and a central bar in the fiducial mw - type disk model ( m1 ) .",
    "numerous spiral arms can be developed at @xmath196 gyr owing to gravitational instability , and they can influence the conversion from h  i to @xmath0 in the gas disk after their formation .",
    "the locations of high - density @xmath0 regions at @xmath196 , 0.8 , and 1.1 gyr appear to be roughly coincident with the locations of h  i spiral arms of the gas disk .",
    "however , @xmath0 shows a very clumpy distribution along spirals arms , which is in a striking contrast with the relatively smooth distribution of h  i along spiral arms .",
    "this implies that only the high - density parts of the gaseous spiral arms can be the possible formation sites of @xmath0 in galactic disks .",
    "numerous @xmath0 clumps can be active star - forming regions in the present sf model based on @xmath0 gas densities .",
    "although the projected distribution of interstellar dust follows the spiral - like distribution of h  i gas , it does not show clump - like structures as @xmath0 .",
    "interstellar dust can become less clumpy , because it can be efficiently destroyed by star - formation ( i.e. , sne ) which can occur in high - density gas clumps .",
    "the physical roles of spiral arms in the formation of gmcs have been already discussed in a number of recent theoretical works based on high - resolution numerical simulations of gas disk evolution in disk galaxies ( e.g. , dobbs et al .",

    "the simulated @xmath0 distribution is more centrally concentrated than h  i gas within the disk owing to the more efficient formation of @xmath0 on dust grains in the inner part of the disk where both gas density and @xmath133 can be higher during the disk evolution .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath0 gas shows small - scale clumpy structures within gaseous spiral arms where gas density can become rather large .",

    "the projected radial density profile of @xmath0 is steeper than that of h  i in this model .",
    "the central part of the disk is dominated by @xmath0 gas and most of the gas particles there have rather high @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) , which implies that molecular hydrogen can be systematically more massive .",

    "this implies that the present model of @xmath0 formation on dust grains is realistic and reasonable for @xmath0 formation in disk galaxies .",
    "although the mcmf can be shifted toward higher masses if a coarser mesh size ( @xmath206 ) is used for the mcmf derivation , the slope of the mcmf does not change significantly .",

    "the formation process of the stellar bar in the central 2 kpc and its influence on gas for @xmath207 gyr are given in appendix a. fig .",
    "4 shows that the gas disk has a very strong concentration of @xmath0 in the central 200 pc at @xmath208 gyr .",
    "this @xmath0 concentration corresponds to the formation of nuclear @xmath0 gas disk due to the dynamical action of the central stellar bar on the surrounding gas . owing to the rather high concentration of @xmath0 in the disk ,",
    "the sfr can be significantly increased , in particular , in the central region of this barred disk galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 fraction can be significantly increased ( from @xmath209 to @xmath210 ) .",
    "thus these results clearly demonstrate that stellar bars can play a vital role in converting h  i to @xmath0 in disk galaxies .",
    "5 describes how the simulated h2sdds depend on the model parameters for metallicity gradient and dust growth / destruction .",
    "the slopes of the h2sdds do not depend strongly on the parameters , though some models ( with steep metallicity gradient and longer dust accretion / destruction timescales ) show the overproduction of high - density @xmath0 regions with @xmath211 @xmath203 pc@xmath204 within their disks .",
    "the larger number of high - density @xmath0 regions is due largely to the stronger central concentration of @xmath0 gas in the inner regions of the gas disks .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4 , a central region of a galaxy is dominated by high - density @xmath0 gas so that almost all of the meshes in the central region can have high @xmath212 . as a result of this",

    "the observed correlation of @xmath9 ( e.g. , blitz et al .",

    "this result implies that the present model for @xmath0 formation , which does not explicitly assume a dependence of @xmath0 formation efficiency on gaseous pressure , does a good job in predicting @xmath7 and its dependence on gaseous pressure .",
    "although the two models with different slopes of gaseous metallicity gradients ( @xmath72 and @xmath217 ) have the slopes of the @xmath220 that are similar to the observed one ( @xmath221 ) , the model with a steep negative gradient of gaseous metallicity ( @xmath73 ) can have the slope more similar to the observed one .",
    "the model with @xmath73 shows a lower @xmath0 formation efficiency at @xmath222 ( @xmath88 k ) in comparison with the model with @xmath72 , mainly because the model with a negative metallicity gradient has a significantly lower dust - to - gas - ratio ( i.e. , lower metallicity ) at the outer region of the disk with lower gaseous pressure so that @xmath0 formation efficiency on dust grains can become lower .",
    "the derived weaker dependence of the slope of the @xmath220 relation on initial metallicity gradients implies that the slopes can be quite similar between different galaxies with different metallicity gradients .",
    "7 describes the simulated @xmath220 relations in models with different model parameters for dust growth and destruction .",
    "these models have the parameter values being less realistic ( e.g. , rather long dust accretion timescale ) in comparison with the models used in fig .",
    "6 so that we can discuss how the dust modeling is important for reproducing the observed @xmath220 relation .",
    "it is clear from fig . 7",
    "that the simulated @xmath220 relation in the model with shorter dust growth timescale ( @xmath223 gyr ) is less consistent with the observed one owing to rather small @xmath7 at higher @xmath215 ( @xmath224 ) in the model . the model with a shorter dust destruction timescale ( @xmath225 and @xmath226 gyr )",

    "can better match the observed one except for rather high gaseous pressure ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "the model with an initially lower dust - to - metal - ratio ( @xmath231 ) shows @xmath220 relation similar to those in fig .",
    "6 , though @xmath7 at higher @xmath215 is systematically smaller than those in fig .",
    "6 owing to the lower @xmath0 formation efficiency caused by the lower dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the models with no dust evolution show significantly shallower @xmath220 relations , irrespective of the slopes of the initial radial metallicity gradients ( @xmath72 and @xmath217 ) .",
    "this result implies that the time evolution of dust abundances in disk galaxies needs to be included for the self - consistent reproduction of the observed @xmath220 relation .",
    "the models without sn feedback ( snf ) and those without chemical evolution show significant deviation from the observed @xmath220 , which strongly suggests that dust growth and destruction processes caused by chemical enrichment and sn explosions need to be carefully included in reproducing the observed @xmath220 relation in a quantitative manner . thus these results demonstrate that as long as the @xmath0 formation processes on dust grains are included in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution , the dust growth and destruction processes , which can be influenced by chemical enrichment and sn explosions , should be carefully considered in discussing the origin of the observed @xmath220 relation .",
    "the observed radial gradients of @xmath7 in disk galaxies ( e.g. , wong & blitz 2002 ) can be an additional constraint for any model for @xmath0 formation in galaxy - scale simulations .",

    "although individual gas particles corresponding to individual local gaseous regions in a disk galaxy have vastly different @xmath7 ( ranging from 0 to 10 ) , the slopes of the radial @xmath7 profiles in the two models with different @xmath70 appear to be similar to the observed one ( @xmath233 ) . the model with @xmath72 can slightly better reproduce the observed slope than the model with @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the simulated slopes similar to the observed @xmath233 demonstrate that the present model for @xmath0 formation on dust grains is quite reasonable and realistic in discussing the global ( galaxy - scale ) distributions of neutral and molecular hydrogen in disk galaxies ( as long as a reasonable set of model parameters for dust is adopted ) .",

    "these clumpy distributions are in a striking contrast with the h  i distributions in disk galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the detailed spatial distributions of @xmath0 in the central few kpc of the disks can be controlled by the presence ( or the absence ) of stellar bars developed from bar instability in the central regions .",
    "10 shows one of clear examples of the strong influences of the central stellar bars on the spatial distributions of @xmath0 in disk galaxies . clearly , the disk galaxy in this model ( m8 ) has a very elongated ring - like structure dominated by @xmath0 , which is formed as a result of dynamical action of the central bar on the gas disk .",

    "secondly , @xmath1 can be initially smaller in the models with smaller @xmath3 for a given @xmath4 ( and @xmath2 ) , mainly because formation of non - axisymmetric structures such as bars and spirals can be suppressed in less strongly self - gravitating disks ( owing to the dominant dark matter halos ) so that @xmath0 formation efficiency can be lower .",
    "the lower surface gas densities in the models with smaller @xmath3 are also responsible for the smaller @xmath1 .",
    "the smaller @xmath1 for smaller @xmath3 can be seen in low - mass models with @xmath240 .",
    "as shown in the model with smaller @xmath3 ( 0.02 ) yet larger @xmath4 ( = 0.33 ) , @xmath1 can be larger than the model with @xmath241 and smaller @xmath4 . since gas consumption by star formation is slower in these models with smaller @xmath3 , the initial @xmath1 difference in the models ( i.e. , larger @xmath1 for larger @xmath4 ) can last for a long timescale .",
    "thirdly , @xmath1 can be _ initially _ larger in the models with smaller bulges , because bigger galactic bulges can slow down or suppress the formation of spiral arms and bars so that @xmath0 formation efficiencies in gas disks can be also severely suppressed by the bulges .",
    "12 shows that although @xmath1 is initially larger in the model with @xmath39 ( fiducial model with a smaller bulge ) than in the model with @xmath242 ( @xmath243 gyr ) , the @xmath1 difference becomes smaller as the time passes by . after the formation of a stronger bar in the central region of the fiducial model , the bar dynamically acts on the gas disk so that a larger amount of gas can be transferred to the central region , where @xmath0 formation is enhanced .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 can become significantly larger at @xmath244 gyr .",
    "this kind of @xmath1 enhancement by the dynamical action of a bar can occur to a lesser extend in the big bulge model with @xmath242 in which only a weak stellar bar can be formed .",
    "it should be stressed here that the models ( m9 and 12 ) with rather large @xmath15 ( 2 and 4 ) , initial @xmath1 is rather low ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath0 consumption by star formation is much less efficient in the models so that @xmath1 can keep slowly rising ( owing to the higher gas densities ) . as a result of this",
    ", these models can finally show larger @xmath1 ( @xmath246 ) at @xmath197 gyr .",
    "therefore , we can not claim that disks with bigger bulges show smaller @xmath1 in the present study .",
    "fourthly , low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies can have initially smaller @xmath238 and @xmath1 owing to their low gas densities .",
    "it should be stressed that owing to much less rapid gas consumption and chemical enrichment , the lsb model can finally have @xmath238 and @xmath1 similar to those of the fiducial model .",
    "fifthly , galaxy interaction between two disk galaxies can significantly increase @xmath1 after the pericenter passage .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath0 formation in disks can be more clearly seen in the ` prograde ' tidal interaction model ( pr ) in which the spin axes of two disks are roughly parallel to those of their orbital angular momentum .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath0 formation , however , can not be clearly seen in other interaction models ( re or distant encounter models ) , which implies that not all of interacting galaxies show significantly large @xmath1 in comparison with isolated field disk galaxies .",
    "galaxy interaction can also change the distribution of @xmath0 and the mcmf , in particular , for the central region .",
    "the mcmfs of interaction models are discussed in appendix a.    sixthly , less massive disk galaxies can have smaller @xmath1 , firstly because the formation of bars and spirals arms can be severely suppressed in the galaxies ( owing to the stronger concentration of dark matter and smaller @xmath3 ) , and secondly because the dust - to - gas ratios ( @xmath133 ) , which are key factors for @xmath0 formation models of the present study , can be lower in the disks . the chemical enrichment processes by sne and agb stars in these low - mass models are so slow ( owing to low sfrs ) that @xmath133 can not increase during the dynamical evolution of the disks .",
    "therefore , the formation efficiencies of @xmath1 can be kept lower in these models .",
    "the low - mass model with @xmath240 and smaller @xmath247 shows rather small @xmath1 , which means that this low - mass disk galaxy is almost @xmath0-less . the baryonic fraction ( @xmath3 )",
    "is particularly important in determining the time evolution of @xmath1 for low - mass disk galaxies .",
    "seventhly , disk galaxies at higher @xmath13 can have larger @xmath1 than those at @xmath34 , mainly because disks are more compact so that a larger amount of @xmath0 gas can be formed in the high - density gaseous regions of the disks .",
    "it should be noted that ( i ) the simulated mw - type disk with low @xmath68 at @xmath83 can have a larger @xmath1 ( @xmath248 ) and ( ii ) even the less massive disk with @xmath249 can have a larger @xmath1 ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "these results imply that high-@xmath13 disk galaxies are highly likely to have systematically rather high @xmath0 gas fractions .",
    "the dependences of @xmath238 and @xmath1 on @xmath4 and @xmath2 can be seen among the simulated disk galaxies at @xmath83 .",
    "13 shows that the five mw - type disk models with different @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 , and surface stellar densities have qualitatively similar projected radial profiles of h  i , @xmath0 , and @xmath7 , though the absolute magnitudes of these surface mass densities are different between the models .",
    "the @xmath212 profiles are steeper than @xmath232 in the five models , and the radial profiles of @xmath7 ( @xmath251 ) have negative slopes ( i.e. , higher @xmath7 at smaller @xmath10 ) .",
    "the mw - type disk models with different @xmath15 have the steeper slopes approximated by @xmath8 whereas the model with higher @xmath4 ( = 0.55 ) and smaller @xmath241 and the lsb model have shallower @xmath7 profiles . the lower @xmath212 in the model with larger @xmath4 is due largely to rapid @xmath0 consumption in the inner disk .    fig .",
    "13 furthermore shows that tidal galaxy interaction can increase both @xmath232 and @xmath212 significantly owing to the strong gaseous concentration formed in the central regions of the interacting disks and the tidal arms .",
    "the strong central @xmath0 concentration is due largely to efficient gas - transfer to the nuclear region induced by tidal bar and gaseous dissipation .",
    "the formation of @xmath0 is more efficient in the central region and",
    "tidal arms during galaxy interaction , which is discussed in more detail in appendix b. the radial profile of @xmath7 in the interaction model at @xmath252 kpc is rather flat and there is the lack of @xmath0 gas in the circumnuclear region ( @xmath253 kpc ) in the model .",
    "the less massive disk models with @xmath240 and @xmath254 have shallower @xmath212 profiles thus shallower @xmath7 profiles too , which is in a striking contrast with the mw - type disk models .",
    "the origin of the low @xmath7 in low - mass disk models is closely associated with weak / no spiral and bar structures ( due to the less strongly gravitation disks ) and initially low @xmath133 .",
    "14 clearly demonstrates that if both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are the same between the fiducial mw - type disk model and the low - mass dwarf disk model ( m25 with @xmath240 ) , then @xmath212 is dramatically different between the two models .",
    "the maximum @xmath255 is only @xmath256 @xmath203 pc@xmath204 in the low - mass disk model , which means that even if baryonic fractions are rather high , gas - poor low - mass disk galaxies are unlikely to form @xmath0 efficiently .",
    "a more gas - rich dwarf disk model shows a higher @xmath212 along s - shaped gaseous region , but @xmath212 is much lower than the mw - type disk model .",
    "the high - z disk models ( @xmath83 ) also have shallower @xmath7 profiles in the present study .",
    "as shown in preceding sections , a strong central concentration of @xmath0 can occur in the barred disk galaxies owing to the dynamical action of stellar bars on gas .",
    "after the rapid consumption of @xmath0 gas in the centrally concentrated gas in the barred disk galaxies , there can be a deficiency of @xmath0 in their central regions .",
    "it is confirmed that the bulge - less disk galaxy with @xmath257 at @xmath258 gyr ( i.e. , after long - term evolution ) , for which a strong bar can be spontaneously formed owing to global bar instability , can finally show the lack of @xmath0 in its central region after rapid @xmath0 consumption by star formation in the central region .",
    "this result implies that if gas accretion onto disks is truncated , even the late - type disk galaxies with no / little bulges can show the lack of @xmath0 gas in their central regions .",
    "15 describes the physical correlations of local properties of @xmath0 with those of dust and stars within galaxies with different model parameters .",
    "these ` internal ' @xmath0-scaling relations will be able to be compared with ongoing observational studies on @xmath0 properties of disk galaxies ( by , e.g. , alma ) , and thus the predicted scaling relations will be useful for interpreting the observational results .",
    "it is clear that the models with different @xmath4 , @xmath15 , and initial stellar mass densities of the disks have a similar positive correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath234 for @xmath259 @xmath203 kpc@xmath204 .",
    "the simulated relatively flat correlation for @xmath260 @xmath203 kpc@xmath204 is due to the strong concentration of @xmath0 in the central regions ( where @xmath234 is high ) caused by dynamical action of the stellar bars on gas in the disks .",
    "the tidal interaction model , in which @xmath1 can be enhanced and @xmath0 distribution can be significantly changed , shows a @xmath261 relation similar to those seen in the isolated mw - type disk models , though the correlation is not so clear owing to the disturbed @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the less massive disk models with low @xmath2 also show strong positive @xmath261 correlations for lower @xmath234 , though the central @xmath0 concentration makes the correlation shallower for higher @xmath234 .",
    "the high-@xmath13 models with @xmath83 also have clear positive @xmath261 correlations , which implies that a linear @xmath261 correlation will be identified in future observations of @xmath0 distributions in high@xmath262 disk galaxies .",
    "these ten models show a much tighter correlation between @xmath212 and @xmath236 , which means that local ism with higher dust surface densities can have higher @xmath0 surface densities in disk galaxies .",
    "this simulated almost linear @xmath263 scaling relation is not so surprising , because @xmath0 formation efficiencies in local ism are assumed to depend on the dust - to - gas ratios of local ism in the present study .",
    "recent observational studies have just started a detailed investigation on the sub - kpc - scale properties of dust in nearby disk galaxies like m31 ( e.g. , viaene et al . 2014 ) , which can be combined with the observed sub - kpc - scale properties of @xmath0 to produce a possible dust-@xmath0 scaling relation within galaxies . the observed @xmath263 scaling relation within galaxies",
    "will be able to be used as a stringent test for any theoretical model of @xmath0 formation on dust grains in galaxies .",
    "16 describes the dependence of the maximum values of @xmath238 and @xmath1 during @xmath264 gyr dynamical evolution on the initial halo masses ( @xmath2 ) and dust - to - gas - ratios ( @xmath133 ) in the selected models .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the models with larger @xmath2 or larger @xmath133 are more likely to have larger @xmath265 and @xmath266 the low - mass models have initially smaller @xmath133 due to the adopted mass - metallicity relation , and spiral arms and bars , which are the major driver for efficient @xmath0 formation in disks , can not be formed owing to the less strongly self - gravitating disks ( i.e. , more strongly dominated by dark matter ) .",
    "this combination of the low @xmath133 and the incapability of bar / spiral formation in the low - mass models is the main reason for the derived dependences of @xmath265 and @xmath266 on @xmath2 and @xmath133 .",
    "it should be stressed here that some models with @xmath267 and those with @xmath268 have no @xmath0 in the disks and thus no star formation in the present star formation models in which new stars can form exclusively from @xmath0 gas .",
    "this means that low - mass disk galaxies with very low @xmath133 are dominated by h  i gas and have no star formation so that they can be identified as isolated massive h  i clouds with no star formation ( in other words , dark h  i galaxies ) .",
    "the total @xmath0 mass can not become larger than @xmath269 in some of low - mass models with @xmath270 , which means that massive star clusters and globular clusters are unlikely to be formed from gmcs in low - mass disk galaxies .",
    "we will discuss this point later in the discussion section .",
    "one of the unresolved problems related to @xmath0 contents of galaxies dependent on hubble types is that sc / sd late - type disks have smaller @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) in spite of their having larger gas masses with respect to their dynamical masses ( @xmath271 , see figs . 4 and 5 in ys91 , as an example for this ) .",
    "although this problem will be able to be better discussed in our forthcoming papers in which @xmath272 cdm galaxy formation models with @xmath0 formation are adopted , we can discuss this problem based on the present new results .",
    "galactic bulges have been demonstrated to suppress @xmath0 formation in ism only for the early dynamical evolution of disk galaxies , if @xmath15 is quite large ( @xmath273 , corresponding to sa / s0 galaxies ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that spiral arms and bars , which can enhance the @xmath0 formation , can be suppressed by the presence of big bulges .",
    "the stronger isrfs of big and dense bulges can be also responsible for less efficient conversion from h  i to @xmath0 in ism",
    ". such a suppression effect of @xmath0 formation can be seen in models with different @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , the larger @xmath1 in disks with smaller bulges can not last long owing to the more rapid gas consumption by star formation .",
    "furthermore , big bulge can severely suppress the star formation so that @xmath1 in disks with big bulges can steadily increase owing to chemical enrichment ( i.e. , increasing @xmath133 ) and finally become significantly larger .",
    "this means that although @xmath1 can be larger in disks with smaller bulges _ for a fixed _ @xmath4 , such disks do not necessarily continue to show larger @xmath1 ( particularly when there is no external gas supply ) .",
    "also the initially larger @xmath1 in disks with smaller bulges appears to be inconsistent with the observed trend of @xmath1 with hubble types .",
    "given these results , it appears difficult to understand the origin of smaller @xmath1 in late - type sc / sd galaxies in the context of the bulge effects on @xmath0 formation .",
    "the central stellar bars formed from global bar instability have been demonstrated to enhance significantly @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) , in particular , in the central regions of disk galaxies , though such enhancement can not last long owing to rapid gas consumption by star formation .",
    "strong spirals arms have been demonstrated to be where @xmath0 formation is very efficient in the present study . given that global bar / spiral instability can be prohibited by big bulges , disks with later types ( i.e. , smaller bulges ) are more likely to have bars and thus show larger @xmath1 .",
    "this possible trend of @xmath1 with hubble types is opposite to the observed trend , which implies that the formation efficiency of stellar bars is not the major factor that determines @xmath1 in sc / sd galaxies .",
    "the present study has also shown that the final @xmath1 of disk galaxies depend on the initial baryonic mass fractions ( @xmath3 ) such that @xmath1 can be larger in the models with larger @xmath3 for a given @xmath4 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "recent observations have shown that @xmath3 can be smaller in galaxies with lower halo masses ( e.g. , papastergis et al .",
    "these observations combined with the present results therefore imply that if the late - type sc / sd galaxies can be preferentially formed from dark halos with lower @xmath2 , then the observed systematically small @xmath1 can be more clearly explained .",
    "although the observed luminosity functions for different hubble types in the local field and the virgo cluster suggests that sa+sb galaxies are systematically brighter than sc+sd galaxies ( e.g. , binggeli et al . 1988 ) , observational studies have not yet determined the mass functions of dark matter halos and baryonic fractions for different hubble types .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether the above explanation for the observed small @xmath1 in sc / sd galaxies is really plausible and realistic , though the smaller @xmath3 in later hubble types would be a promising scenario .",
    "the present study has shown that low - mass disk galaxies show rather small @xmath274 ( maximum possible @xmath0 fraction ) and therefore can be identified as h  i - dominated galaxies .",
    "the major physical reason for this very low @xmath0 contents is that these low - mass galaxies are extremely dust - poor so that they can not form @xmath0 on dust grains .",
    "the possible smaller @xmath3 in these low - mass galaxies can also contribute to the very low @xmath0 formation efficiency of the ism .",
    "furthermore , some of the simulated low - mass galaxies with rather high initial @xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) can show virtually @xmath275 , if @xmath2 is as low as or lower than @xmath276 .",
    "these results imply that there would exist low - mass , and extremely low surface - brightness galaxies with only h  i gas : these are almost ` dark ' galaxies .",
    "so far no observational studies have found strong evidence for the presence of _ isolated _ ( or ` intergalactic ' ) dark h  i - rich galaxies with total gas masses larger than @xmath269 in the nearby universe , though a number of observational studies investigated h  i contents of galaxies in group environments ( e.g. , kilborn et al 2005 ; pisano et al .",
    "although most of the detected h  i objects have optical counterparts ( or tidal origin ) in these observations , a few observations so far discovered massive apparently isolated h  i gas clouds with masses larger than @xmath277 ( e.g. , davies et al . 2004 ; kolibalski et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these intriguing massive isolated objects are likely to be just tidal debris rather than dark h  i galaxies ( e.g. , bekki et al . 2005 ) .",
    "if h  i - dominated low - mass dark galaxies do not exist , the present study implies that such low - mass galaxies had lost almost all of their gas at their formation epochs or during their evolution owing to some physical processes such as ram pressure stripping and cosmic reionization .",
    "the present study has shown that ( i ) some low - mass galaxies with @xmath267 can not form @xmath0 efficiently owing to their low dust masses and consequently ( ii ) the total @xmath0 masses are unlikely to exceed @xmath278 .",
    "these results can have the following implications on the formation of massive star clusters , in particular , globular clusters ( gcs ) , the origin of which remains unexplained .",
    "as recent theoretical studies of gc formation have demonstrated ( e.g. , dercole et al .",
    "2008 ; bekki 2011 ) , the initial stellar masses of gcs should be @xmath279 times larger than the present ones ( typically , @xmath280 ) : here we do not discuss the physical reasons for the proposed rather high initial masses of gc progenitor .",
    "this means that the original gmcs from which the initial massive stellar systems can form should be larger than @xmath281 even for a high star formation efficiency of @xmath282 .",
    "these theoretical results on gc formation combined with the present results imply that low - mass galaxies with @xmath267 are unlikely to form gcs within them owing to the low @xmath0 contents",
    ". it would be possible that only low - mass , low - density star clusters , can form in their host low - mass galaxies .",
    "these low - mass clusters are prone to tidal destruction by their host galaxies so that they can finally become field stars within their hosts .",
    "if there exists a threshold halo mass above which gcs can form , then it can not only explain the observed absence of gcs in some faint dwarf galaxies in the local group ( e.g. , van den bergh 2000 ) but also provide a physical basis on the minimum halo mass of gc host galaxies introduced in recent semi - analytic models of gc formation in galaxies based on hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g. , bekki et al .",

    "in the present fiducial mw - type disk model ( m1 ) , a stellar bar can play a significant role in the formation of @xmath0 on dust grains and the dynamical evolution of @xmath0 gas , in particular , in the later evolution of the central region of the gas disk .",
    "we here briefly describe the bar formation process in this model . as shown in fig .",
    "a1 on the time evolution of stellar surface density ( @xmath291 ) of the disk , a stellar bar can start to develop around @xmath292 gyr owing to bar instability in this model with a relatively small bulge mass .",
    "the formation of a strong nuclear bar can be completed by @xmath197 gyr so that the bar can influence the gas dynamics there after its formation ( e.g. , a massive nuclear @xmath0 disk can be formed at @xmath258 gyr as a result of dynamical interaction between the bar and @xmath0 gas , as shown in fig .",
    "the gaseous component ( h  i+@xmath0 ) also shows a bar - like distribution in the central region of the disk when the stellar bar forms at @xmath197 gyr .",
    "figs . b1 and b2 show intriguing @xmath0 distributions of galactic disks in selected models . in fig .",
    "b1 , the initial @xmath212 of each mesh at @xmath293 is calculated by assuming that @xmath0 mass fraction is 0.01 just for convenience , because @xmath0 formation efficiency based isrf etc is not calculated at @xmath293 .",
    "the formation efficiency of @xmath0 on dust grains can be significantly enhanced in the strong tidal arms of the interacting disk galaxy for the prograde interaction model ( m16 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "b1 ( at @xmath196 gyr ) . during the efficient gas infall onto the nuclear regions , both h",
    "i and @xmath0 gas densities can become significantly higher so that star formation rates can be high in the nuclear region and the tidal arms .",
    "after tidal interaction , the @xmath0 distribution appears to be clumpy with a number of off - center high - density @xmath0 clumps in the disk .",
    "such off - center massive gas clumps can be also seen in recent models of gas - rich interacting galaxies by yozin & bekki ( 2014b ) .",
    "since the number of tidal interaction models investigated in the present study is rather small ( @xmath294 ) , we can not conclude whether such a clumpy @xmath0 distribution is a characteristic of post - interacting galaxies .",
    "we will investigate this point in our future works by performing a larger number of numerical simulations of interacting galaxies with a much wider range of model parameters for galaxy interaction .",
    "b2 shows that a gas - rich , more compact disk at @xmath83 can have a widespread spatial distribution of @xmath0 gas in the model m15 . in this model ,",
    "the baryonic mass fraction is lower than the fiducial mw - disk model ( i.e. , less strongly self - gravitating ) so that the formation of a strong bar can be suppressed .",
    "therefore , a bar - like distribution of gas can not be clearly seen in this model . even in the outer part of the gas disk , high - density @xmath0 regions can be seen , which is in a striking contrast with the @xmath0 distribution of the low-@xmath13 fiducial mw - disk model ( m1 ) .",
    "the gas disk at @xmath83 appears to be composed of numerous small @xmath0 clumps , which implies that the mass function of molecular clouds ( mcmf ) can be significantly different between @xmath34 and @xmath83 .",
    "since the present simulation does not have enough resolution to investigate mcmfs , we will discuss this point in our future numerical works with a much larger number of gas particles ."
