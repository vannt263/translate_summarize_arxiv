    "if the early inflation field(s ) have non - trivial interactions , higher - order correlation functions of the curvature perturbations will contain _ connected _ pieces encoding information about the primordial inflationary interactions .",

    "[ fig : feynman ] for an example involving the four - point function ) .",
    "a detection of non - gaussianity therefore gives an important window into the nature of the inflation field(s ) and their interactions .",

    "this parameterization of the curvature perturbations is known as the local model as this definition is local in space .",

    "we believe establishing what constraints can be placed upon @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath14 by future experiments is important in determining what models may and may not be tested by future data .",

    "we obtained wmap noise and beam function from publicly available data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after obtaining the theory , data and simulated curves we use the best fitting procedure described in  @xcite where we minimize @xmath209 to fit @xmath3 and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "our results are listed in table  [ tab : label ] .",
    "we see that @xmath1 and @xmath3 are consistent with zero with 95% confidence level ranges @xmath6 and @xmath7 for v+w - band in foreground - cleaned maps .",
    "the 95% confidence intervals of @xmath1 versus @xmath3 are plotted in figure  [ fig : confidence ] for each band . for a v band analysis alone ,",
    "the 68% confidence intervals are @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "these error bars are within @xmath21240% and @xmath21220% of the optimal fisher values discussed above comparing with wmap 7-year level noise for @xmath3 and @xmath1 respectively .    combining @xmath213 from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath214 from our skewness analysis we get @xmath215 at 95% confidence .",
    "if instead we had assumed @xmath216 from wmap-7 analysis  @xcite and same @xmath3 reported here we find @xmath217 at 95% confidence .",
    "the difference of the two estimates is a reflection on the central value of @xmath0 since @xmath14 = @xmath218 and therefore a smaller @xmath0 results in a larger uncertainty in @xmath219 .",
    "this behavior is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : danl ] .    no measurements involving wmap 7-year data",
    "have been preformed using these estimators .",
    "it is our opinion that the results for wmap 7-year data will not be much different than for the wmap 5-year data , just as the optimal results using the traditional skewness statistic @xmath145 do not differ significantly between these two data sets .",
    "@xcite    planck , on the other hand , is in a position to make significant improvements in the measurement of non - gaussianity using these estimators . since planck is taking data , we encourage any plans to measure @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 using the skewness and kurtosis spectrum statistics that we have proposed .",
    "in addition to ruling out the standard single - field slow - roll inflation model with a detection of non - gaussianity in general , planck is in a position to possibly rule out all single - field models with a measurement of @xmath17 .",
    "in this paper we discussed the skewness and kurtosis power spectrum approach to probing primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "we outlined the expected constraints these techniques will place using future experimental data .",
    "these constraints were calculated by computing the signal - to - noise for each estimator , properly taking into account the noise and beam of each experiment .",
    "optimal error bars for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are listed as a function of @xmath195 .",
    "it was argued that the skewness and kurtosis power spectrum approach to measure non - gaussianity has several advantages .",
    "these advantages include the ability to separate foregrounds and other secondary non - gaussian signals , the ability to measure the scale dependance of each statistic and an advantage that the cut sky can be corrected from a matrix @xmath220 without needing to compute extra linear terms .",
    "the physical significance of each non - gaussian statistic is discussed . in the bispectrum , different non - gaussian triangle configurations in fourier space contributing to @xmath0 are related to different underlying physics . by adding a local measurement of the trispectrum , a new statistic @xmath221 will be a powerful probe to distinguish between multi - field models .",
    "single - field models can be ruled out in general if @xmath17 and we discussed how this may be a real possibility with planck or epic .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath14 large enough , the trispectrum becomes a better probe for non - gaussinity than the bispectrum for analysis utilizing information on very small scales .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 will be the hardest to constrain .",
    "a constraint on this parameter will uncover information on self - interactions .",
