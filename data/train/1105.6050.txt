    "the potential is the most important non - observable physical quantity in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is not an observable , yet it determines all the physical observables .",
    "there are two ways of determining the quantum mechanical potential .",
    "if the quantum system has a classical counterpart , one can use the correspondence principle .",
    "otherwise we determine the potential by calculating observables and comparing them to experiments .",
    "almost all , so called  elementary  particles are in fact composite particles made of even more elementary particles .",
    "these constituents are fermions that obey the pauli principle , i.e.  they can not occupy the same quantum state . the pauli principle , and",
    "the internal structure and dynamics of the constituent fermions can lead to a very complicated potential for the composite particles .    the simplest way to model",
    "the pauli effect is to use a repulsive short range potential , which suppresses the wave function at short distances .",
    "the parameters of this phenomenological potential are determined either by an the inverse scattering method or by fitting models to experiments . in most models",
    "local potentials are used .",
    "generally these models can not provide an acceptable description of three body data , which results in the need for three - body potentials .",
    "an alternative approach is that we try to incorporate all the information about the internal structure and dynamics of composite particles into their mutual interactions .",
    "several potentials based on the nuclear cluster model @xcite have been proposed .",
    "one possibility is to derive the interactions from the cluster model in the framework of the resonating group method ( see eq .  ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the other approach is more phenomenological .",
    "it uses some information on the structure of composite particles , but incorporates some phenomenological potential , whose parameters are determined by fitting the results to experiments .",
    "the pioneer of this type of model is the orthogonality condition model by saito @xcite , where the states are orthogonal to predefined pauli forbidden states . in the method of buck ,",
    "friedrich and wheatley @xcite a deep potential is adopted , and it is assumed that the lowest few states are forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "the fishbone model by schmid @xcite goes beyond previous models as it introduces the concept of partially pauli forbidden states .",
    "it was a common belief that if we incorporate all the information about the internal structure of the particles into their mutual interactions then the three - body potential would be small , perhaps negligible .",
    "however , for @xmath1 particles , while phenomenological shallow local potentials under - bind the three-@xmath1 system , cluster model inspired phenomenological potentials considerably over - bind them .    in this work",
    "we revisit the problem of interaction of composite particles .",
    "we consider the fishbone model of the @xmath0 interaction . we have chosen the @xmath0 potential , because the @xmath1 particle has an exceptionally strong binding energy .",
    "we adopted the fishbone model because , in our opinion , this is the most elaborated phenomenological cluster - model - motivated potential . the variant of the fishbone potential has been designed to minimize and to neglect the three - body potential",
    ". therefore we can try to determine the interaction by a simultaneous fit to two - body and three - body data .",
    "previously we studied the @xmath0 fishbone model @xcite and proposed a new parametrization of the fishbone @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we fitted the two - body phase shifts and the three-@xmath1 ground state energy .",
    "later we found that the results are not stable against varying the parameters . here",
    ", besides two body phase shifts and the three-@xmath1 ground state , we include the three-@xmath1 @xmath2 ground , the @xmath2 resonant state , and the @xmath3 bound state .    in section",
    "ii we will outline the fishbone model for the composite particles . in section iii",
    "we determine the @xmath0 potential by using two-@xmath1 and three-@xmath1 data .",
    "finally we draw some conclusions .",
    "the fishbone model is motivated by the cluster model . in the resonating group model",
    "the total wave function is an antisymmetrized product of the cluster @xmath4 and the inter - cluster @xmath5 relative states @xmath6 the state @xmath4 , which is supposed to be known in this model , describes the internal properties of the clusters , including spin and isospin structure .",
    "the unknown relative motion state @xmath5 is determined from the variational ansatz @xmath7 this ansatz results in a rather complicated equation for @xmath5 , which was possible to solve only by using serious approximations on @xmath4 and on the interaction of the particles . in a typical example @xmath8 describes fermions in harmonic oscillator potential wells located at some distance apart and @xmath5 is the relative motion of the oscillator wells .",
    "we can easily see that if we express @xmath5 in terms of harmonic oscillator states , some of the lowest states in the relative motion space are not allowed due to the pauli principle .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the two - body fishbone model is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the kinetic energy operator .",
    "our knowledge on the internal structure and the pauli principle are incorporated in the fishbone potential @xmath11 where @xmath12 refers to partial wave and @xmath13 is a local potential .",
    "the states @xmath14 are eigenstates of the norm operator , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the center of mass distance of the two clusters . if the relative motion is forbidden by pauli principle then @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 eigenvalues are ordered such that @xmath20 .",
    "the matrix @xmath21 is then given by @xmath22^{1/2 } } , & \\text{if $ i \\le j$ } , \\\\",
    "1-\\frac { \\displaystyle   1-\\eta_{l , j } } { \\displaystyle    [ ( 1-\\bar{\\eta}_{l , j } ) ( 1-\\bar{\\eta}_{l , i})]^{1/2 } } , &    \\text{if $ i > j$ } ,   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 if @xmath18 and @xmath24 otherwise . in matrix form ,",
    "if we have one pauli forbidden state , we have @xmath25 the matrix elements of @xmath21 exhibit a fish - bone - like structure ; hence the name of the model . in this model",
    "the pauli - forbidden states become eigenstates at @xmath26 energy . by choosing @xmath26 as large positive ,",
    "they become bound states at large positive energy , and thus disappear from the physically relevant part of the spectrum .",
    "there are several versions of the fishbone model which differ in off - shell transformations , i.e.  in transformations which effect the internal part of the wave function and leave the asymptotic part , and consequently the spectrum , unchanged .",
    "this version of the model minimizes the three - body potential .",
    "we can extend the two - body fishbone model to three clusters by embedding the two - body fishbone potential into the three - body hilbert space @xcite .",
    "we use the usual configuration space jacobi coordinates .",
    "for example , the coordinate @xmath27 denotes the vector between particles @xmath28 and @xmath29 , while @xmath30 connects the center of mass of the subsystem @xmath31 with the particle @xmath32 .",
    "the three - body fishbone hamiltonian is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , is the kinetic energy operator .",
    "here we have omitted the three - body potential .",
    "the fishbone potential is rather complicated .",
    "it has a local coulomb - like part augmented by a nonlocal short range potential .",
    "the numerical treatment is also nontrivial .",
    "however , in the past couple of years , in a series of publications , we developed a method for dealing with potentials of this type .",
    "we solve the lippmann - schwinger integral equation for two - body problems and faddeev integral equations for three - body problems .",
    "we approximate the short - range parts of the potential in the coulomb - sturmian basis .",
    "this basis allows an exact analytic evaluation of the coulomb green s operator , in terms of a continued fraction for the two - body case , and in terms of a contour integral for the three - body case . for details , see eg .   ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "we adopt a model that in the @xmath1 particles the nucleons are in @xmath36 states in a harmonic oscillator well of width parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the norm kernel eigenvalues are also harmonic oscillator states with the same width parameter and the eigenvalues are known @xcite : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this shows that in the @xmath41 relative motion channel there are two pauli - forbidden states , in @xmath42 there is one , and in @xmath43 and higher channels there are none .",
    "the decreasing value of @xmath44 indicates that in the relative motion the harmonic oscillator sates with higher quantum number are less and less suppressed by the pauli principle . for the @xmath26 parameter of the fish - bone model , which aims to remove the pauli - forbidden states , we took @xmath45 mev . in this range of @xmath26 ,",
    "the dependence of the results was beyond the fifth significant digit .",
    "we used the experimental phase shifts from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a fishbone potential of the @xmath0 system was determined by kircher and schmid @xcite .",
    "the harmonic oscillator width parameter was fixed to @xmath46 , which leads to the length parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the local potential was taken in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fitting parameters .",
    "they were determined by fitting to experimental phase shifts .",
    "the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 were found to provide the best fit .",
    "while this potential provides a reasonably good fit to @xmath41 and @xmath42 phase shifts , it results in too much binding for the three-@xmath1 system .",
    "it gives @xmath53 mev , while the experimental three-@xmath1 binding energy is @xmath54 mev .",
    "one may conclude that similarly to conventional local potential models , there is a need for a three - body potential .",
    "this was the choice that oryu and kamada @xcite adopted .",
    "they added a phenomenological three - body potential to the fish - bone potential of kircher and schmid and found that a huge three - body potential is needed to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "so , the conclusion was , that although the fishbone potential provides a good fit to two body data , it needs strong three - body force to reproduce the three - body data .",
    "this is with a the potential which was designed such that the three - body force could be neglected .",
    "this is certainly not the case .",
    "so , although , the model has some good features with this parametrization , it do not meet up to its promise .",
    "we refitted the two-@xmath1 experimental data with the potential ( [ locpot ] ) . besides the phase shift data we also incorporated the famous @xmath41 two-@xmath1 resonance state at @xmath55 mev .",
    "we found that the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 provide the best fit .",
    "the fit to the @xmath0 phase shift is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . by calculating three-@xmath1 states",
    "we get @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 mev , and @xmath61 mev .",
    "so , still the fishbone model with parameters extracted from two - body data only , can not provide a good description to three - body experimental binding energies .    , @xmath42 and @xmath43 phase shifts from two - body data.,width=321 ]    on the other hand , two - body data are sensitive mostly on the outer part of the potential and they are less sensitive on the inner part .",
    "we may use this fact to find a fishbone potential which fits simultaneously to two - body and three - body data .",
    "so , besides the two - body phase shifts and the @xmath41 two-@xmath1 resonant state , we incorporated the @xmath2 three-@xmath1 ground state at @xmath62 mev , the @xmath2 three-@xmath1 excited state at @xmath63 mev , and the @xmath3 three-@xmath1 bound state at @xmath64 mev .",
    "we achieved the best fit to experiments with parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this set of parameters provides an @xmath41 two-@xmath1 resonant state at @xmath68 mev .",
    "the corresponding wave function is shown in fig .  [ 2awf ] . note the peculiarity of the fishbone model in that the ground state wave function has nodes due to the orthogonality to the fully pauli forbidden states .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "we can see that the agreement with the experiments is almost as good as before . for the three-@xmath1 states we get @xmath69 mev , @xmath70 mev , and @xmath71 mev .",
    "the @xmath2 states are almost in perfect agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the @xmath3 bound state is slightly over - bounded .",
    "@xmath0 resonant state at energy @xmath68 mev.,width=321 ]    , @xmath42 and @xmath43 phase shifts from two - body and three - body data.,width=321 ]",
    "in this work we propose a new parametrization of the fishbone @xmath0 potential .",
    "we determined the potential by a simultaneous fit to two-@xmath1 and three-@xmath1 data .",
    "we found that with three fitting parameters one can describe the two - body resonance and phase shifts in all partial waves .",
    "the potential also provides a reasonably good description to three - body data without invoking any three - body potential .",
    "we can learn from this study that if we incorporate our knowledge on the structure of composite particles into their interaction , like we do in the fishbone model , we can achieve a substantial simplification of the potential . here ,",
    "in the @xmath0 case , we have only three parameters , while in the conventional ali - bodmer - type potentials , we have a couple of independent parameters in each partial wave , plus additional parameters for the three - body potential .",
    "we believe that cluster - model - based models for interaction of composite particles deserve further considerations .",
    "the fishbone model of schmid is especially appealing as it faithfully represents the pauli principle and uses the concept of partly pauli forbidden states .",
    "it could also serve as a framework for the nucleon - nucleon potential .",
