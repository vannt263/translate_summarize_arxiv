    "high-@xmath0 superconductivity shows up when carriers are doped to parent mott - insulating cuprates where the energy gap opens due to strong electron correlations , i.e. , strong coulomb repulsions between electrons .",
    "it remains unsolved what exactly happens to the electronic structure when a small number of holes are introduced into the mott - insulating state , although it is intuitively expected that such holes can move around and give rise to some charge conductivity ; indeed , cuprates show a metallic transport behavior at moderate temperature upon slight hole doping .",
    "@xcite recent progress in the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite has elucidated that an unusual electronic structure called  fermi arcs \" are formed in the brillouin zone at the fermi energy ( see fig .",
    "1 ) when the metallic transport emerges in the lightly hole - doped cuprates . for example , in la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( lsco ) with @xmath5 = 0.03 , where a metallic transport is observed down to @xmath670 k ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , a well - defined quasiparticle - like peak is observed in a limited loci in the brillouin zone , which defines the fermi arc;@xcite intriguingly , these loci lie on the putative non - interacting fermi surface that would be realized in the absence of strong correlations . since the fermi arc starts and ends in the middle of the brillouin zone , it is not straightforward to apply such basic notion as the luttinger sum rule@xcite that holds in ordinary fermi liquids",
    ". therefore , the fermi arc is a striking manifestation of the new physics that stems from the strong electron correlations in hole - doped cuprates , and its understanding is obviously an important step towards understanding the high- @xmath0 superconductivity .     of a series of high - quality lsco single crystals measured up to 400 k. note that a metallic behavior ( @xmath7 ) is observed at moderate temperature in all these samples , even for @xmath5 = 0.01.,width=283 ]    currently , there are essentially two schools of thoughts to interpret the fermi arcs:@xcite one is to assume that the hole doping creates small ( closed ) hole pockets , but only a half of the pocket can be seen by arpes due to a peculiar coherence factor of the strongly - correlated state .",
    "@xcite the other is to consider that there is a large inherent fermi surface that is screwed due to the strong correlations , and asserts that only a portion of this large fermi surface gains a spectral weight upon slight hole doping and forms the fermi arcs .",
    "@xcite it would be very useful if one could elucidate which of the two is likely to be valid in view of the available transport data . in this article ,",
    "i will try to make a case for the large fermi surface picture based on the mott - limit argument .",
    "note , however , that those two pictures both implicitly assume that the system is uniform , and it will be a different story if the electrons develop a self - organized inhomogeneity in the lightly hole - doped cuprates .",
    "an important principle for discussing whether a system should be a metal or an insulator is the _",
    "mott limit _ ( or mott - ioffe - regel limit),@xcite which is based on very simple physics : for the metallic transport to be realized in a crystalline system , the bloch waves of the electrons near the fermi energy @xmath9 must be well - defined , which dictates that their mean free path @xmath10 must be longer than the wave length @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this condition leads to the mott limit that is expressed as @xmath13 , which is equivalent to @xmath14 .",
    "since this argument is quite crude , it is customary to relax the condition a little and consider the mott limit to be given by @xmath15     associated with the fermi arc in ( a ) the small hole pocket picture and ( b ) the large fermi surface picture .",
    "here , only a quarter of the 1st brillouin zone is shown.,width=264 ]    a prominent difference between the small hole pocket picture and the large fermi surface picture for the fermi arc is that the former gives a small @xmath1 , while the latter dictates that @xmath1 must be large , as shown in fig .",
    "( note that , for the discussion of the charge transport by holes , @xmath1 should be measured from the top of the relevant band . ) to examine the metallic transport in lsco shown in fig .",
    "2 , let us try to estimate the electron mean free path @xmath10 by using the simple drude theory , which gives the following expression for the resistivity : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electron effective mass and @xmath18 is the relaxation time .",
    "note that in the present case we consider a layered quasi - two - dimensional system with the layer distance @xmath19 , and the resistivity @xmath20 is measured in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) unit @xmath21 cm . to calculate @xmath18 from @xmath20",
    "we need the carrier density @xmath22 , and we assert that it is the carrier density suggested by the hall coefficient that should be used for this calculation . this is because in the lightly hole - doped regime ( 0.01 @xmath23 0.05 ) , as was demonstrated in ref . , the hall coefficient @xmath24 is nearly constant at moderate temperature ( see fig .",
    "4 ) and its value agrees very well with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 3.8   is the in - plane lattice constant .",
    "( it is shown in the next section that , based on the boltzmann theory , one should use the  small \" @xmath22 for this calculation even within the large fermi surface picture . )     of high - quality lsco single crystals in the lightly - doped regime ( @xmath28 ) measured up to 400 k. note that @xmath24 is essentially @xmath29-independent at moderate temperature , and its value agrees very well with @xmath30 (= @xmath31 ) , suggesting that a small carrier density @xmath32 is actually determining the transport properties.,width=302 ]    in the small hole pocket picture , one may use the conventional formula @xmath33 for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) system , which , together with @xmath34 , leads to the simple , well - known formula @xmath35 in the most extreme case of @xmath5 = 0.01 , @xmath36 at 300 k is 20 m@xmath21 cm ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which gives @xmath37 0.1 according to eq . ( 3 ) . obviously",
    ", the mott limit eq .",
    "( 1 ) is strongly violated in this picture .",
    "on the other hand , in the large fermi surface picture , one may use the value @xmath38 0.6 @xmath39 suggested by the arpes data.@xcite one may also adopt the @xmath40 value from arpes experiments which found universal @xmath40 of @xmath61.5 ev  that is nearly independent of doping.@xcite together with the estimate @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the free electron mass ) based on optical conductivity studies,@xcite in this picture @xmath36(300 k ) of 20 m@xmath21 cm would lead to @xmath43 5 fs , which gives @xmath44 10   and @xmath37 6 .",
    "this satisfies the mott limit and , hence , the metallic transport in the lightly hole - doped regime is naturally understood .",
    "therefore , the fact that a metallic transport is realized at moderate temperature even at @xmath5 = 0.01 points to the conclusion that the large fermi surface picture is the more appropriate one , while the small hole pocket picture bears a paradox .",
    "let us now discuss how the boltzmann transport theory@xcite should be applied to the system that has fermi arcs instead of an ordinary fermi surface .",
    "first , one should remember that in the boltzmann theory the charge current @xmath45 is calculated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the deviation of the distribution function @xmath48 from its equilibrium @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 is caused by the action of an electric field @xmath51 , in the relaxation time approximation @xmath45 can be written as @xmath52 it should be noted that @xmath53 in eq . ( 5 ) is non - zero only near the fermi surface , and this is why the surface integral on the fermi surface appears in eq .",
    "the special care we take in the present calculation to accommodate the fermi arc picture is that we allow the relaxation time @xmath54 to vary over the fermi surface .",
    "assume that @xmath51 is along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "for a 2d system , one obtains from eq .",
    "( 6 ) that @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the line element of the fermi  surface \" in the 2d brillouin zone .    adopting",
    "the large fermi surface picture implies that one accepts the existence of an underlying large fermi surface , across which the occupation number of the electronic states changes from one to zero . in order to incorporate the fermi arcs in the above framework of the boltzmann theory",
    ", one may suppose that only on the  arc \" portion of the underlying large fermi surface , @xmath54 is long enough ( @xmath58 ) to allow well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "furthermore , one may suppose @xmath54 = 0 elsewhere on the underlying fermi surface , which means that the states outside the fermi arcs are incoherent .",
    "it should be remembered that upon performing the energy integral in eq .",
    "( 5 ) to derive eq . (",
    "6 ) , we relied on the fact that @xmath53 is non - zero only near the fermi surface ; the property @xmath59 still holds at the underlying fermi surface even when there are no well - defined quasiparticles on it ( such a surface is called  luttinger surface \" in the recent literature@xcite ) , so eq .",
    "( 8) is still valid in this picture .    with the above modeling of the fermi arcs ,",
    "one obtains the conductivity on the fermi arc as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the total length of the fermi arcs . if the large fermi surface is recovered ( i.e. , the arcs touch the brillouin zone boundary ) , the conductivity @xmath62 would be written as @xmath63 ( @xmath64 is the total length of the underlying fermi surface ) , so the conductivity of the fermi arc system can be expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 . since the arpes data suggests that @xmath67 increases linearly with doping in the lightly - doped regime,@xcite eq .",
    "( 11 ) allows us to understand why the  small \" @xmath22 determines the conductivity even when the underlying fermi surface , and hence @xmath1 , is large .",
    "quantitatively , the total length of the actual fermi arcs observed in the lightly - doped lsco is about a factor of three too long@xcite to explain the measured @xmath36 with the above simple formalism , which indicates that a more elaborate modeling of the fermi arcs , such as a @xmath68 dependence of @xmath69 , is necessary for a more quantitative description ; nevertheless , the present model allows an intuitive understanding of the transport involving the fermi arcs in the framework of the conventional boltzmann theory .        as for the hall conductivity @xmath70",
    ", the same modeling of the fermi arcs leads to a simple result . for 2d metals ,",
    "@xmath70 is most conveniently calculated by using the geometrical interpretation where @xmath70 is given by the  stokes area \" traced out by the * * _ l_**@xmath71 vector which defines the ong s  * _ l_*-curve\".@xcite since * * _ l_**@xmath72 , the * * _ l_**@xmath71 vector is non - zero only for those @xmath68 s that are within the fermi arcs ( fig .",
    "5 ) , and in the simplest case of a circular underlying fermi surface and constant @xmath54 on the fermi arcs , one obtains @xmath73 . in this case , the hall coefficient can be written as @xmath74 this essentially explains why the fermi arcs can give rise to a hall constant that reflects the  small \" @xmath22 .",
    "of course , for a really quantitative understanding , one needs a more elaborate modeling of the fermi arcs .",
    "it is prudent to mention that the strong localization ( or insulating ) behavior is observed at low temperature in the lightly - doped regime .",
    "while at first sight it appears natural for the strong localization to occur when there are only a small number of carriers , when one calculates the @xmath8 value at the onset of the localization , one finds it unusually large .",
    "for example , at @xmath5 = 0.05 , @xmath75 shows strong localization below 50 k , where @xmath36 = 0.9 m@xmath21 cm ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and the corresponding @xmath8 value is as large as 13 .",
    "this is very unusual , because the strong localization is observed only when @xmath76 in ordinary materials.@xcite    such an unusual nature of the localization in the lightly - doped regime is obviously related to the @xmath77 insulating behavior that shows up when the superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic fields in underdoped lsco,@xcite because the @xmath8 value estimated by using eq .",
    "( 3 ) at the onset of the insulating behavior was as large as 13 for @xmath5 = 0.15.@xcite it is intriguing that the @xmath77 insulating behavior in lsco has been observed for @xmath78 0.15,@xcite which exactly matches the doping range where the fermi arcs are observed by arpes.@xcite this coincidence may imply that the fermi arcs are inherently insulating at @xmath29 = 0 in the absence of superconductivity,@xcite and the physical origin of the  insulating \" behavior at large @xmath8 values is an important remaining question .",
    "it is discussed that the large fermi surface picture for the fermi arcs allows us to understand the metallic transport observed at moderate temperature in the lightly hole - doped regime in a natural way ; the small hole pocket picture , on the other hand , leads to a paradoxical conclusion of strong mott - limit violation , as long as the system is considered to be uniform .",
    "also , it is shown that the charge transport involving the fermi arcs with large underlying fermi surface can be understood in the framework of the conventional boltzmann theory , by simply assuming that only on the fermi arcs the quasiparticle lifetime is finite ; furthermore , the proposed model allows us to intuitively understand why the  small \" carrier density determines the transport properties even when @xmath1 is large .",
