    "nonetheless , we can conclude that simple configurations such as a single nuclear reflector or a patchy torus fail to match the data , and an additional lower column density component is needed .",
    "from the combined modeling we performed in the previous section , there are a few points worth stressing .    the quality of the data plays an important role in constraining the fits .",
    "with poorer quality data , such as that from , , or bat shown in figure  [ fig : m04_fix_allhard ] , several of the models we considered produce acceptable fits . only with the data",

    "seperately , we find that the combination of good - quality nuclear and host spectra creates considerable tension for several models which would otherwise fit the total and spectra at acceptable levels .",
    "this study demonstrates that it can be important to have both high - quality spectra above 10 kev and spatially resolved x - ray spectra in order to , e.g. , reject simple monolithic cold reflection models .",
    "the recent analysis of the circinus galaxy by @xcite also benefited from the powerful combination of high - quality data and spatial separation of the nuclear and host components , demonstrating that there too a significant fraction of the warm and cold reflection components arise from well beyond 2 ( i.e. , 38pc at the distance of circinus ) .",

    "the higher @xmath6 components contributed flux primarily to the compton hump above 10kev while the lower @xmath6 nuclear reflector is needed to reproduce the curvature of the continuum around 10 kev and it also provides the missing fe line flux to model the whole structure with solar ( as opposed to highly supersolar ) metallicity .",
    "thus , this configuration effectively decouples the two key features of compton reflection which are typically assumed to be coupled .",
    "* there are strong differences in the ratios of the 210kev fluxes of the warm and cold reflection components , depending on the model employed and the parameters being fit . because of the decoupling mentioned above",
    ", it could be dangerous to extrapolate the full properties of the reflector using simple reflection models , as has typically been done in the past with either lower - quality data or in type 1 agns dilluted by transmitted continuum .",
    "we note that this decoupling could be at least partially responsible for some of the apparently high fe abundances which have been quoted in the literature ( e.g. , m04 ) . *",
    "considering only the data , we find that @xmath730% of the neutral fe k@xmath8 line flux arises from @xmath92 ( @xmath7140  pc ) in an extended configuration . extrapolating this fraction inward assuming an increasing solid angle of dense molecular clouds implies that a significant fraction ( and perhaps the majority ) of the fe k@xmath8 line arises from compton - scattering off of material well outside of the fiducial 110pc torus material . a follow - up investigation looking into the spatial distribution of this material around several local agn will be presented in bauer et al .",
    "( 2015 , in preparation ) . *",
    "the multi - component reflector configuration envisioned here comprises a compact compton - thick torus - like structure covering 50% of the sky and more tenuous , extended @xmath458@xmath5 clouds covering @xmath459% of the sky within the nuclear region ( @xmath10140pc ) , as well as larger - scale , low - covering factor compton - thick clouds which extend out to 100s of pc .",
    "this scenario bears striking similarities to the multiple dust structures found via mid - ir interferometry for , and may eventually allow some independent corrobration of the clumpy torus model .",
    "the benefits of combining high - quality @xmath910kev spectral sensitivity from and spatially resolved spectroscopy from are clear , and could offer novel constraints on the few dozen closest , brightest agn on the sky . moving on to fainter and more distant objects , however , is likely to be challenging with current instrumentation due to the extremely long integrations required and the increasingly poor intrinsic spatial resolutions obtained .",
    "moreover , we should caution that our best - fit multi - component reflector , which we modeled only with three distinct column densities , could be an oversimplification , and in fact there might be a continuous distribution of different column - density reflectors , given that the galactic molecular cloud probability distribution function is well represented by a power law over a wide range of column densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". each cloud might contribute something to the overall reflection spectrum , thereby modifying the spectral shape away from that of a single monolithic reflector .",
    "hopefully by acquiring similar constraints in other nearby compton - thick agn to those found for and circinus , combined with an assessment of the parameter space for obscuring clouds from mid - ir interferometry studies , we can amass enough clues in the short term to model distant and/or faint objects in a more informed manner . ultimately ,",
    "if the _ athena _ mission @xcite can achieve its best - case scenario for spatial resolution of a few arcseconds , it could open up spatially resolved fe analysis to a significantly larger range of agn and help us to place these local agn in broader context .",
