    "in recent years , the physics of josephson phenomena enjoyed a number of important developments .",

    "striking improvements in managing josephson phenomena came after injection of currents into one of the thin - film banks was introduced that allowed for continuous control of the phase difference on the junction @xcite and , in particular , to imitate the 0-@xmath4 behavior .",
    "this development necessitates evaluation of the injected supercurrent distribution in one of the junction banks since this determines the distribution of the superconducting phase .     at the film edge .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] -2 cm    in one of common realizations , the junction is formed by two  half - infinite \" thin - film strips with overlapped edges .",
    "extra current injectors are attached to the edges of one of the films , shown schematically in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "the injected current affects the phase distribution in the thin - film bank where it flows and thus the phase difference on the junction .",
    "we show in this communication that for sufficiently thin films with the size @xmath0 smaller than the pearl length @xmath1 the problem of the injected currents can be solved under very general assumptions , so that the design of junctions with needed properties becomes possible .",
    "consider a half - infinite thin - film strip of a width @xmath5 where @xmath2 is the london penetration depth of the film material and @xmath3 is the film thickness .",
    "choose @xmath6 along the strip , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 across so that @xmath9 , fig.[f1]b . let the injection points be at @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the film edge .",
    "the london equation integrated over the film thickness reads : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the sheet current density and @xmath14 is the self - field of the current @xmath15 .",
    "the biot - savart integral for @xmath16 in terms of @xmath15 shows that @xmath16 is of the order @xmath17 , whereas the second term on the left - hand side of eq.([london ] ) is of the order @xmath18 .",
    "hence , in narrow strips with @xmath19 , the self - field can be disregarded . introducing the scalar stream function @xmath20 via @xmath21 $ ]",
    ", we obtain instead of eq.([london ] ) : @xmath22 physically , this simplification comes about since in narrow films the major contribution to the system energy is the kinetic energy of supercurrents , while their magnetic energy can be disregarded .",
    "the boundary condition of zero current component normal to edges , e.g. , @xmath23 at the edge @xmath24 , translates to @xmath25 constant along the edges .",
    "this constant , however , is not necessarily the same everywhere , in particular , it should experience a finite jump at injection points .",
    "consider a point contact at the edge as illustrated at fig.[f1 ] , take its position as the origin of polar coordinates , and integrate the @xmath26 component of the current @xmath15 along the small half - circle centered at the injection point .",
    "the total injected current is : @xmath27 hence , on two sides of the injection point the stream function experiences a jump equal to the total injected current .",
    "clearly , at the current sink @xmath20-jump has the opposite sign .",
    "thus , we can choose @xmath28 everywhere at the edges of the half - infinite strip , except the segment between the injection and sink points , where @xmath29 .    to solve the laplace equation ( [ laplace ] )",
    "we first employ the conformal mapping of the half - strip to a half - plane : @xcite @xmath30 it is seen that the half - plane @xmath31 is transformed to the half - strip of a width 1 ( hereafter we use @xmath0 as a unit length ) .",
    "explicitly , this transformation reads : @xmath32 hence , we have to solve the laplace equation on a half - plane @xmath31 subject to boundary conditions @xmath29 at the edge @xmath33 in the interval @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath28 otherwise .    to proceed ,",
    "we first write the  step - function \" @xmath36 at the edge @xmath33 as a fourier integral : @xmath37 since @xmath38 is a linear superposition of plane waves @xmath39 , we first consider the solution of the laplace equation @xmath40 subject to the boundary condition @xmath41 .",
    "separating variables we obtain @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the solution for the actual boundary condition is : @xmath43 substituting here @xmath44 of eq.([fourier - comp ] ) one obtains : @xmath45 it is seen that at @xmath46 , @xmath29 if @xmath34 and @xmath28 othewise , as it should be .",
    "thus , we have the steam function at the half - plane @xmath31 for arbitrary positions @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the current contacts at the edge @xmath33 .",
    "we now can go back to the @xmath49 plane and specify the injection positions .",
    "let the injector and the sink be at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath53 the lines of the current @xmath15 are given by @xmath54 or by @xmath55 , in other words , by contours of @xmath25 const .",

    "]    it is worth noting that the same method can be employed for currents injected to thin - film samples of any polygonal shape .",
    "according to the schwartz - christoffel theorem any polygon can be mapped onto a half - plane .",
    "the general solution ( [ solution1 ] ) on the @xmath61 plane will hold . therefore , knowing the function which realizes the needed transformation , one obtains @xmath62 . the only physical precondition for this method to work is the requirement of a small sample size on the scale of pearl length @xmath63 , that allows one to reduce the problem to the laplace equation for the stream function @xmath20 .",
    "the method can be applied for more than two injection points or to extended injections , which require though different boundary conditions imposed on @xmath20 .",
    "we now note that the sheet current is expressed either in terms of the gauge invariant phase @xmath64 or via the stream function @xmath20 : @xmath65 this relation written in components shows that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function .",
    "it is easy to construct the phase on the @xmath61 plane since @xmath68 hence , the phase corresponding to the stream function of eq.([solution1 ] ) obeys : @xmath69 or @xmath70 the characteristic current @xmath71 depends on the pearl length .",

    "we then conclude that zeros roughly scale as the inverse of the contact separation , @xmath102 .",
    "we also observe that maxima of @xmath99 seem to be independent of contacts separation .",

    "@xmath124 for different contact separations @xmath125 can be rescaled to a universal curve @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , the zeros of @xmath90 and the positions of its maxima should scale as @xmath102 . unlike their positions , the absolute value of its @xmath127-th maximum is independent of the separation @xmath123 .",

    "the presence of zeros of @xmath90 for symmetric injection in zero field , has an important consequence . if the injected current @xmath137 is such that @xmath138 , application of the magnetic field will result in the pattern @xmath139 such that @xmath140 , i.e. , the curve @xmath139 will have zero at @xmath136 instead of the standard maximum",

    "in summary , we have shown that the current distribution in thin film samples small on the scale of the pearl length @xmath1 can be found by solving the laplace equation for the stream function under boundary conditions specified for injection sources at arbitrary points at sample edges .",
    "when this film constitutes one of the josephson junction banks , the contribution of the phase associated with injected currents to the junction phase difference is proportional to the injected current @xmath142 .",
    "hence , the thinner the film ( or the larger the pearl @xmath143 ) the smaller injected currents are needed for the same effect upon the junction properties .",
    "the critical josephson current @xmath90 , for certain ( symmetric ) infection geometries , has zeros , the position of which scales as the inverse distance between the injection points .",
    "if @xmath137 is one of these zeros , application of a field @xmath133 parallel to the junction plane results in a pattern @xmath144 with zero at @xmath136 instead of a standard maximum , the property seen in experiments . @xcite + the authors are grateful to e. goldobin for sharing experimental information and many helpful discussions .",
