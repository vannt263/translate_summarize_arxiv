    "in an undulator , free - electron laser , gyrotron , cherenkov and resonant transition radiations , etc . , as well as in many proposed laser accelerators , an electron ( e ) beam interacts with an electromagnetic ( em ) wave or a laser ( l ) beam by propagating almost parallel to it ( i.e. almost normally to the em - fields ) , while the energy exchange is usually facilitated by a small electric field component _ parallel _ to the e - beam .",
    "diffraction of the l - beam , scattering of electrons by the strong transverse electric field , and the guoy phase shift impose limitation on most of the `` parallel '' acceleration configurations .",
    "alternatively , when the electrons cross the em - wave _ normally _ to its propagation , the energy exchange is in most cases inhibited by `` elastic '' nature of the dominant gradient , or ponderomotive force @xcite . on the other hand , recent plasma - wakefield accelerators",
    "@xcite demonstrated acceleration gradients of about 0.27 gev / cm @xcite presenting thus a strong challenge to the free - space laser acceleration techniques .",
    "plasma - wakefield approach was also proposed @xcite to develop a femtosecond electron bunching _ via _ excitation of dynamic bistability of the nonlinear plasma wave .    in this letter",
    "we show , however , that when a laser and e - beam run _ normally _ to each other , two major factors acting _ together _ allow for strongly _",
    "inelastic _ scattering and huge energy exchange between the beams in free space : ( i ) large field gradients ( e.g. extremely tight laser focusing ) allow electrons to gain and retain energy at near-@xmath3 distance , where @xmath3 is the laser wavelength ; ( ii ) currently available laser intensities ( up to @xmath4 v / cm ) , greatly exceeding a relativistic scale , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is wave number and @xmath7 is the rest mass of electron , allow for energy transfer beyond @xmath8 mev and acceleration gradients two orders of magnitude higher than those of plasma - wakefield accelerators @xcite .",
    "the relativistic intensities mitigate limitations on field gradient , while it is virtually impossible to attain strong non - elasticity with non - relativistic intensities .    with em - field polarization parallel to the velocity of electron ,",
    "an electron undergoes a direct acceleration / de - acceleration by that field acting as a `` laser gate '' .",
    "even if the e - beam passes through the gate without _ net _ energy gain , its laser - modulated momentum can cause strong temporal , klystron - like focusing of the exiting e - beam resulting in ultra - short e - bunches with the quantum - limited length down to zepto - seconds .",
    "such a system has a potential to operate as a full - switch laser gate for electrons , a new base element of a free - electron laser or laser electron accelerators , generator of powerful ultra - short em - pulses and e - bunches , as well as high harmonics .",
    "the kinetic energy of e - beam required to form super - short e - bunches is not prohibitively high and allows one to use e.g. electron microscope guns for experiments .",
    "in general , the relativistic lorentz force driving an electron in laser field , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron momentum , and @xmath11 - relativistic factor , depends on both electric , @xmath12 , and magnetic , @xmath13 fields @xcite .    if @xmath14 , the @xmath13-field becomes a major player , which may e.g. result in the sign reversal of ponderomotive force @xcite",
    ". however , in the anti - node plane of an infinite standing wave , where an @xmath12-field peaks , the @xmath13-field vanishes .",
    "this remains true also for an anti - node located precisely at the focal plane of a _ focused _ l - beam , where the phase front is ideally flat whether it is a paraxial gaussian or focused to an ultimate @xmath15 spot l - beam @xcite ( see below eq . ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the basic configuration chosen by us here , is a tightly focused linearly polarized standing wave ( propagating in the @xmath16-axis ) , and an e - beam that passes in its focal anti - node plane in the x - axis , parallel to polarization of electric field @xmath17 with phase @xmath18 and amplitude spatial profile @xmath19 , @xmath20 as @xmath21 @xcite using normalized variables , @xmath22 , we write eq .",

    "while in general even ( [ eq2 ] ) is not solved analytically , it can be well approximated in some limits .",
    "the most common low - gradient case allows for adiabatic approximation resulting in a cycle - averaged ponderomotive force acting on a particle @xcite . in general",
    ", the result of this approximation is that at the exit , ( i ) the particle momentum and energy do not depend on the laser phase ; ( ii ) the system exhibits elastic scattering , i.e. electrons do not gain ( or lose ) energy from ( or to ) the em - field .",
    "the fast relativistic oscillations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are comparable with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where sign @xmath28 denotes the time - averaging .",
    "however , the amplitude @xmath29 of fast oscillations of @xmath30 is small @xmath31 in nonrelativistic case , and limited by @xmath32 - in strongly - relativistic case . characterizing the field gradient by the scale of transverse field inhomogeneity , @xmath33 ( or l - beam amplitude spot - size at fwhm , @xmath34 ) , along the electron trajectory , the universal condition of the applicability of adiabatic , elastic scattering of electrons by the laser is then @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the major parameter of the problem .",

    "this results in the `` phase - dispersion '' of exiting electrons ; the system is not ergodic anymore . for the elastic scattering we have @xmath48 .",
    "thus , to quantify the effect of non - ergodicity and inelasticity of the process , one may evaluate the net gain / loss of the electron energy at the exit from the laser gate ; @xmath49 , by averaging over all the phases of randomly arriving electrons in the case of incoherent e - beam ( preformed e - bunches should be treated separately ) .",

    "are due to interference fringes ( spatial tails ) of the l - beam profile of eq .",

( 4 ) .    remarkably , electrons acquired this energy gain over the distance of @xmath104 .",

    "another way to attain sub-@xmath3 field profiles is to make electrons run through the well known diffraction field pattern @xcite near a straight edge .",
    "propagation of electrons in the sub-@xmath3 confined relativistic fields brings about a `` quasi - static '' behavior , whereby the l - field can be assumed almost `` frozen '' in time as an electron passes through it . in this case , instead of the amplitude of the field , the defining parameter is a full field area along the `` line - of - fire '' , @xmath114 , and @xmath115^{1/2}\\ \\ \\",
