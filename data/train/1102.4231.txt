    "within the framework of quantum field theoretical models , it has been shown recently that the role of various combinatorial notions is a crucial one .    inside the area of theoretical physics , quantum field theory ( qft ) represents an important part ; its mathematical formalism was proven successful not only in elementary particle physics ( the celebrated standard model ) but also in condensed matter physics .",
    "like in other domains of theoretical physics ( exact solutions of statistical - mechanical problems , random matrix models , integrable systems and so on ) , also in qft a key role is played by combinatorics .",
    "thus , perturbative qft relies on graph theory , namely on ( feynman ) graphs which appear in the expansion with their combinatorial weights ; moreover , as we will present in this survey , graph polynomials can be naturally related to polynomials appearing in some representation of the feynman amplitudes in qft .",
    "furthermore , renormalization , which lies at the heart of qft , can be described through some appropriate combinatorial hopf algebras , as we will see in the sequel .    on the other hand ,",
    "techniques of analytic combinatorics ( such as the mellin transform or the saddle point method ) are also used in qft for computing and analyzing quantities like feynman integrals ( which are associated to feynman graphs ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , in the last years , both combinatorialists and theoretical physicist in general ( or field theorists in particular ) became more and more aware of this strong relation between their domains .",
    "this is a natural tendency , since the unfolding of new ideas in physics is often tied with the development of new combinatorial methods .",
    "we can thus speak nowadays of an emerging domain of combinatorial physics .    as already announced above , in this survey",
    "we focus on the appearance of combinatorial notions in qft , such as graph and map polynomials and combinatorial hopf algebras .",
    "thus , in graph theory the celebrated tutte polynomial ( see @xcite ) is known to characterize in a particularly elegant way a generic graph . on the other hand ,",
    "the feynman integral of such a graph can be represented , through the parametric representations , using some polynomials in a set of parameters associated to the edges of the graph . in this survey",
    "we present the relation between the tutte polynomial ( or , more exactly , its multivariate formulation @xcite ) and the polynomials of this qft parametric representation @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we also present how the connes  kreimer hopf algebra of feynman graphs @xcite encodes in a powerful manner the combinatorial structure of perturbative renormalization in qft .",
    "we then generalize this framework and lift it to ribbon graphs ( also known as maps , see for example @xcite and references therein ) . at this level",
    ", the tutte polynomial can be replaced in a natural manner by the bollobs ",
    "riordan polynomial @xcite . from the qft point of view , the appropriate models are the non - commutative ones ( we present here the scalar @xmath1 model implemented on the moyal space ) . in this case also , a parametric representation generalizing in a highly non - trivial manner the commutative one can be defined @xcite .",
    "one can then relate the bollobs ",
    "riordan polynomial to the polynomials of the parametric representations of these qft models on the non - commutative moyal space @xcite .",

    "this operation identifies the two vertices @xmath36 and @xmath37 at the ends of @xmath33 into a new vertex @xmath38 , attributing all the edges attached to @xmath36 and @xmath37 to @xmath38 , and then it removes @xmath33 .    if @xmath33 is a self - loop , then @xmath35 is the same as @xmath34 .",

    "in this section we introduce a few notions of qft , the latter being a general framework lying at the very heart of fundamental physics .",
    "qfts give a quantum description of particles and interactions , which is naturally compatible with einstein s theory of special relativity .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , qfts led to the standard model of elementary particle physics , which is one of the best experimentally tested theories ( for example in huge particle accelerators like the cern s lep ) .",

    "the tool used in theoretical physics is the _ perturbative expansion _ , i.e. , an _ expansion of the exponential _ above in powers of @xmath72 .",
    "the coefficients of such an expansion are sums of multiple integrals ( see and ) ; the number of these integrals grows rapidly with increasing _",
    "order _ in perturbation theory ( i.e. , power of the coupling constant @xmath72 ) .",
    "to these multiple integrals , called _ feynman integrals _ , one associates _",
    "feynman graphs _ , which are very useful in the organization of the expansion coefficients .",
    "for the @xmath0 model exhibited here , the graphs have degree four at each vertex ; moreover one has internal and external edges ( see , for example , figure  [ fig : nor ] ) .",
    "each of these graphs comes with its combinatorial weight ( which is highly non - trivial because of the non - labeling of the edges ) .",
    "furthermore , the feynman integrals can then be manipulated using various techniques of analytic combinatorics ( the mellin transform or the saddle - point approximation ) .    in momentum space ,",
    "one orients each edge @xmath33 ( internal or external ) and associates to it some momentum @xmath79 .",
    "the contribution from any internal edge comes from the quadratic part of the action and reads @xmath80 this contribution is called the _",
    "propagator_.    the contribution of some vertex is given by the coupling constant @xmath72 times a @xmath81-function of conservation of the incoming / outgoing momenta at the respective vertex . if the momenta of the external edges are fixed ( they correspond to physical states ) , the momenta of the internal edges are free and one has to integrate over them , leading to the respective feynman integral .",
    "for the example of figure  [ fig : nor ] , all this reads @xmath82 we leave it as an exercise to the interested reader to find out the orientation of the edges which was chosen for such a feynman integral to occur .",
    "because of the presence of the three @xmath81-functions in , the number of remaining integrals is equal to two , which is actually the number of independent cycles of the feynman graph ( this being a general result in qft ) . at the end of the story , for the feynman integral",
    "all this leads to a logarithmic divergence in the high energy ( @xmath83 ) regime of the internal momenta ( the so - called _ ultraviolet regime _ ) .",
    "the appearance of such divergences is in fact a very frequent phenomenon in qft ; it is the _ renormalization _ process which , when possible , takes care of these infinities in a highly non - trivial way ( see , for example , the book @xcite ) .",
    "let us now give some insight in this process of renormalization in qft .",
    "if the considered qft model is renormalizable , the graphs which lead to divergences should correspond to terms present in the action .",
    "in order to illustrate what we mean by this , let us go back to the example of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the graphs which lead to the various divergences of the model need to have two or four external edges .",
    "thus , these divergences can be `` cured '' by an appropriate renormalization of the parameters of the action ( for example , the mass @xmath42 and the coupling constant @xmath72 ) .",
    "for instance , a graph with four external edges ( each of these four external edges being associated to a field @xmath74 ) corresponds to the renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath72 .",
    "this comes from the fact that the coupling constant @xmath72 is indeed the parameter by which the @xmath0 term in the action is multiplied .",
    "let us take as an example the graph @xmath22 with four external edges in figure  [ locality - xy ] .     and @xmath45 .",
    "[ locality - xy],width=151 ]    in configuration space , the feynman integral to renormalize reads ( up to irrelevant normalization factors ) @xmath84 where we have denoted the four external points that the external edges hook to by @xmath85 .",
    "note that the propagators @xmath86 are given by the inverse fourier transforms of the momentum space propagators  they are associated to the quadratic part of the configuration space action , i.e. , they are integral representations of heat kernel functions ( by a slight abuse of notation we have denoted propagators in both configuration and momentum space by @xmath87 ) .",
    "we now subtract a term corresponding to the configuration space region @xmath88 the integral is divergent and can be rewritten , using an appropriate taylor expansion , as @xmath89 one can prove that the second term in the sum above  the renormalized feynman integral  is finite ( see , for example , the book @xcite for details ) , while the first is the one containing the divergence  it will be subtracted .",
    "this term is called _ local counterterm _ : @xmath90 the adjective  local \" comes from the fact that this expression is associated , as shown above , to the configuration space region .",
    "the operator @xmath91 represents the first term in the taylor expansion .",
    "note also that in we have explicitly considered the multiplication with the four fields @xmath61  this divergent term can thus be reabsorbed , as already mentioned above , in a redefinition of the coupling constant @xmath72 .",
    "since the model is translation - invariant , the second integral in is independent of @xmath75 , and thus the counterterm is of the same form as the interaction term in the action .",
    "we have thus shown that _ the subtraction of a local counterterm makes the renormalized feynman integral finite .",
    "_    the locality of the counterterms can be seen as _ sending all of the external edges to the same point _ ( here @xmath75 ) , again , in configuration space .",
    "the phenomenon described here can also be exhibited in momentum space ( see , for example , the review paper @xcite for the same example treated in momentum space ) .",
    "nevertheless , subtraction of the divergences can be more involved .",
    "one can have graphs with subdivergences . in order to introduce the general ( bogoliubov ) subtraction operator for a feynman graph , we first need the following definition .    a _ zimmermann forest _ @xmath92 of a feynman graph @xmath22 is a set of subgraphs of @xmath22 such that @xmath93    the zimmermann forest defined above is a notion distinct from that of a forest in graph theory ( see definition  [ toate](7 ) ) .",
    "the ( bogoliubov ) subtraction operator reads @xmath94 where the sum is over all zimmermann forests @xmath92 of superficially divergent subgraphs @xmath95 ( including the empty forest ) .",
    "the superficially divergent graphs are , in the case of the @xmath0 model , the graphs with two or four external edges ( this result comes from the so - called power counting theorem ) .    applying this subtraction operator to a feynman integral @xmath96 extracts the divergences .",
    "the remaining part , the _ renormalized feynman integral _",
    "@xmath97 is finite .",
    "an example of a feynman graph with subdivergences is given in figure  [ big ] , where the feynman graph of figure  [ locality - xy ] is a subgraph .",
    "renormalizing this subdivergence leads to the renormalization of the whole graph .",
    "this can be explicitly seen from the following facts .",
    "the zimmermann forests of this graph are @xmath98 the renormalized feynman integral thus reads @xmath99 where we have used the general property @xmath100 , @xmath95 being a subdivergence of the feynman graph @xmath22 .",
    "note that we wrote @xmath101 for the _ cograph _ obtained by shrinking the subgraph @xmath102 inside @xmath95  _ shrinking _ a subgraph means to replace its internal structure by a point .",
    "this graph - by - graph renormalization method is known under the name of the bogoliubov ",
    "hepp  zimmermann ( bphz ) renormalization scheme , and it is one of the most frequently used in qft .    for a general feynman graph , it is also possible to have _ overlapping divergences _ ,",
    "i.e. , divergent subgraphs with a non - empty intersection . in this case",
    ", one can use a classification theorem of zimmermann forests in order to prove finiteness of renormalized feynman amplitudes . in this case",
    ", one needs a scale decomposition of the graph s propagators .",
    "this means that each propagator @xmath87 is written as a sum of distinct contributions , each such contribution corresponding to a distinct energy scale ( see the book @xcite for a detailed presentation of these issues ) .",
    "let us also mention that , once the renormalization techniques are performed , the renormalized ( and hence finite ) integral leads to physical quantities which are measured in elementary particle collider experiments with an extremely high accuracy .    in the case presented here ,",
    "the @xmath0 model , the mass @xmath42 prevents the integral to be divergent also in the _ infrared regime _",
    "( that is , for @xmath103 ; see , for example equation  , which is convergent in this regime ) .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "let us also mention that , when computing feynman integrals , mathematical physicists are interested in graphs with no bridges ( called @xmath25-particle irreducible ( @xmath25pi ) graphs ) .",
    "this comes from the fact that the momentum of the bridge can not flow towards its high energy regime , because it is directly related to the external ( and thus always finite ) momenta .",
    "these graphs are thus of no interest for a renormalization analysis .",
    "let us now proceed further and introduce the _ parametric representation _ of a feynman integral .",
    "the main idea is to write each of the internal propagators of the integral as an integral over some parameter @xmath104 : @xmath105 inserting these formulas in the general expression of a feynman amplitude allows to integrate out ( through gaussian integrations ) the internal momenta @xmath79 .",
    "the feynman integral then becomes @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a polynomial in the set of parameters @xmath104 and @xmath108 is a polynomial in the set of external momenta @xmath109 and the set of parameters @xmath104 . it can be shown that these polynomials depend only on the underlying graph .",
    "more specifically , one has @xmath110 and @xmath111 where the first sum is over all trees @xmath112 of the graph @xmath22 , while the second sum is over two - trees @xmath113 , which , as already stated in the previous section ( see definition  [ toate](9 ) ) separates the graph in two connected components and one can identify the external edges which connect to one or the other of these connected components .",
    "the symbol @xmath114 denotes one of the connected components thus obtained .    by momentum conservation ,",
    "the total momentum of one of these connected components ( for example @xmath114 ) is equal to the total momentum of the other connected component .",
    "for the example of figure  [ fig : nor ] , one has @xmath115",
    "let us now exhibit the relation between the notions presented in the two previous sections , the multivariate tutte polynomial on the one hand , and the polynomials of the parametric representation of feynman integrals on the other hand .",
