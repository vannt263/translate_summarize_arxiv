    "the most important principle in timber engineering to produce structural wood components of constant quality , consists of cutting wood into smaller pieces , selecting the best ones , and joining them again by adhesive bondings .",
    "what is known as a rather simple processing step becomes quite complicated , once we look in detail at the penetration of the hardening adhesive into the porous wood skeleton .",
    "unfortunately the details of the adhesive penetration can influence bond performance in multiple ways and the quality of the adhesive bonds determine the overall performance of structural parts @xcite .",
    "what complicates studies of adhesive penetration is the interplay between pore space geometry and fluid transport , cell wall material and adhesive rheology and of course process parameters like amount of adhesive , growth ring orientation , and surface roughness , just to name a few @xcite . while for soft wood predictions are rather simple , the micro - structure of hard woods complicates the problem significantly , since adhesives can penetrate through the big vessel network deep into the wood structure @xcite . in a previous work we explored the topological characteristics of the vessel network in beech _",

    "adhesive penetration into hard wood was studied before @xcite , although only experimentally or in descriptive form . for soft wood",
    ", the penetration depth can be expressed by a simple trigonometric function , describing the filling of cut tracheids @xcite .",
    "for hard wood however a model that characterizes the wood anatomy in order to predict the penetration depth and the amount of adhesive inside the structure is unknown .",
    "we construct an analitycal model based on the network properties and predict the adhesive penetration and the saturation of the vessel pore space .",
    "our model has two - scales : the first scale describing the transport of a hardening adhesive through a single vessel in time due to an applied pressure and capillarity effects , and also with the possibility of constant diffusion of solvent through the vessel wall , what turns out to be important for some adhesives like pvac or uf .",
    "when the viscosity increases by hardening and/or loss of solvent , the adhesive front slows down and finally stops . on the second , or network scale , the result for single vessels is embedded into a network model with identical topological properties like pore size distribution and connectivity that are characteristic for the vessel network of the respective wood .",
    "the model is compared with experiments where specimens are bonded with parallel longitudinal axes under varying growth ring angles using three different adhesive systems : prf , uf , and pvac .",
    "first we describe the rheological model of the adhesives , before we calculate the penetration into a single vessel with diffusion into the half space .",
    "subsequently we discuss the network construction and the consideration of process parameters . with all model components at our hands ,",
    "we finally compare the model with the experiments and discuss the results .",
    "adhesive penetration is the result of an interplay of adhesive hardening , capillary penetration , and technological processing . in order to set up a model for adhesive penetration of hard wood",
    ", we have to combine several models in a hierarchical way .",
    "first we address bulk viscosity evolution of adhesives due to generic hardening mechanisms . on the fundamental level , we model the penetration of a fluid into one single , straight or wavy pipe .",
    "this model is enriched by diffusive transport of solvent through its wall . on the next hierarchic level ,",
    "we project the fundamental model onto a network structure of perfectly aligned hard wood that represents the vessel network .",
    "finally , we rotate the result of the vessel network penetration to consider the general situation , where the adhesive surface is not necessarily aligned to the material orientation . we show how material parameters like porosity , hardening time or applied amount of adhesive will limit penetration .",
    "the hardening process of various adhesives can be described by the temporal evolution of the viscosity @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the hardening type , different viscosity models need to be applied .",
    "for example reactive adhesives do not depend on the solvent concentration , while the viscosity evolution of solvent based adhesives strongly depends on solvent concentration @xmath1 . in part",
    "i @xcite of this work , we showed experimental viscosity measurements for uf , pvac , and pur .",
    "if solvent concentrations are important , like in the case of pvac , the viscosity evolution can be expressed by @xmath2 \\exp(\\beta [ 1-c ] ) \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parameters that depend on the adhesive type and the initial solvent concentration . for pvac adhesive ,",
    "we find @xmath4@xmath7@xmath5@xmath7@xmath8 , since the hardening process is mostly due to the loss of moisture and the initial viscosity only depends on the initial concentration . for pur adhesive ,",
    "the same expression can be used , however the concentration is kept constant during the process , expressed by @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 and constant @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 that only depend on the initial concentration .",
    "unfortunately a whole class of adhesives , can not be described by eq .",
    "[ nuall ] , since their hardening process is more complex .",
    "for example the uf adhesive changes from liquid phase to gel phase during penetration , resulting in penetration arrest . the only active processes after this phase transition are the chemical curing reactions .",
    "therefore the viscosity model should take into account the critical time when the phase transition occurs . additionally , the concentration of the solvent changes in time due to the diffusion of the solvent into the cell wood structure .",
    "we propose the viscosity relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are experimental parameters . using the data from ref .",
    "@xcite we found @xmath10@xmath7@xmath14 mpa@xmath15s@xmath16 and @xmath12@xmath7@xmath17s and variable parameters ( @xmath11 and @xmath13 ) that depend on the initial solvent concentration .",
    "note that @xmath13 describes the time when the penetration process finishes due to the liquid - gel transition .",
    "using these two generic hardening models , we are able to describe the viscosity evolution of numerous adhesives",

    "we presented an analytical model for the prediction of the penetration depth of adhesives , paint or hardening fluids in general , into the beech wood structure .",
    "since we focused on hard wood , the pore space of wood is formed by a network of interconnected vessels .",
    "the network is characterized by parameters that are related to amplitude and wavelength of the oscillating vessels in tangential and radial direction and the porosity of wood originating from the vessel network .",
    "we compared the model to experiments and found good agreement for various adhesives . therefore , even though we reduce the wood anatomy to a homogeneous , regular network , adhesive transport for the much more disordered , complex pore space of real beech wood seems well described .",
    "the analytical model considers generic types of adhesive hardening .",
    "however if other special fluids are to be considered , only the viscosity dependence on concentration and time need to be known .",
    "we applied the model to three major types of adhesive which are pur , uf , and pvac and compared the respective penetration depths . for adhesives whose hardening process depends on the change of concentration , we include a description for solvent concentration diffusion inside the beech wood .",
    "this approach makes the model applicable for adhesives like uf and pvac .",
    "penetration is limited by two things : the penetration due to the applied pressure that is arrested by hardening processes , and the total amount of applied adhesive that is available to penetrate into the vessel network .",
    "the smaller penetration depth is the limiting one . by comparing the model with the experimental data we showed that it is possible to model the maximum penetration depth for three different used adhesives , namely pur , pvac , and uf .",
    "our model is sufficiently simple to allow for a broad applicability . by determining the morphological and rheological parameters ,",
    "it can be applied to a wide range of wood species and to fluids with various hardening kinematics to predict the penetration depth of these fluids into porous structures , when transport is dominated by capillarity .",
