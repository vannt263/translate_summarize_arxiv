    "the epoch of reionization marks a major phase transition of the universe , during which the intergalactic space became transparent to uv photons . determining when this occurred and the physical processes involved represents the latest frontier in observational cosmology . over the last few years",
    ", searches have intensified to identify the population of high - redshift galaxies that might be responsible for this process .",
    "recent data from the hubble space telescope wfc3 infrared camera provided a dramatic advance accessing the faint side of the z@xmath8 uv luminosity function ( lf ) @xcite , while wide field ground - based surveys are starting to detect the brightest galaxies at z@xmath9 @xcite . these surveys provided evidence that the uv lf evolves significantly with redshift @xcite , that the uv continuum of galaxies appears progressively bluer with increasing z ( @xcite but see also @xcite ) and that their stellar masses are on average smaller than those of their lower - z counterparts @xcite , while the morphologies remain essentially unchanged from z @xmath16 to z@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these results are entirely based on color selected samples .",
    "the lack of spectroscopic redshifts prevents us from deriving firm conclusions based on these early samples .",
    "first , an unknown fraction of interlopers biases the estimates of size and redshift distribution which are needed to compute the lf .",
    "the lack of spectroscopic redshift also introduces degeneracies in the sed fitting that make the masses and other physical properties poorly determined .",
    "finally only spectroscopic observations of high - z ly@xmath2 emission have the potential to provide a definitive answer to the major question of how and when reionization occurred @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath2  emission line is a powerful diagnostic since it is easily erased by neutral gas outside galaxies .",
    "its observed strength in distant galaxies is therefore a sensitive probe of the latest time when reionization was completed ( e.g. robertson et al .",
    "indeed some recent studies pointed to a decrease in the number of ly@xmath2  emitters ( laes ) at z@xmath17 @xcite and failed to detect bright laes at even higher redshift @xcite .",
    "in a recent work we also found a significant lack of intense ly@xmath2  in ultradeep spectra of candidate @xmath10 lyman break galaxies @xcite ( f10 from here on ) .",
    "all these works seem to indicate that we might be approaching the epoch when the intergalactic medium was increasingly neutral .    to address these issues we have carried out a systematic follow - up of our sample of z@xmath9 candidates : galaxies",
    "were initially selected as z - dropouts in three independent fields , the goods - south field ( giavalisco et al . 2004 ) , the new technology telescope deep field ( nttdf , arnouts et al .",
    "1999 , fontana et al . 2000 ) and the bdf-4 field ( lenhert & bremer 2003 ) from deep near - ir hawk - i observations , covering a total area of 200 arcmin@xmath11 , complemented by wfc3 observations @xcite .",
    "we then carried out deep spectroscopic observations with fors2 .",
    "the first results were published in f10 where we reported the confirmation of a weak ly@xmath2 emission line at @xmath12 in the goods - south field , and in vanzella et al .",
    "2011 ( v11 ) were we presented two galaxies in the bdf-4 field , showing bright ly@xmath2 emission at @xmath13 .    in this final paper",
    "we present the results on the z - dropouts obtained in the ntt deep field , where we confirm two further galaxies at z@xmath14 through the presence of ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "we also present and briefly discuss the results obtained on the i - dropout galaxies that were observed in the three separate fields as secondary targets .",
    "finally we give an overview of the results obtained on the entire z - dropout sample and compare them to the expectations based on lower redshift observations to determine the redshift evolution of the fraction of ly@xmath2  emitters in lyman break galaxy samples .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results on the epoch of reionization .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system , and we adopt @xmath15  km / s / mpc , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the targets were selected as candidate z@xmath8 galaxies according to the criteria described extensively in c10b : besides the five @xmath18band dropout candidates listed in table 3 of that paper , two further @xmath18band dropouts were also included in the slits .",
    "these two objects ( nttdf-474 and nttdf2916 ) have a y  band magnitude that is slightly fainter than the completeness limit applied in c10b to derive the luminosity function ( they have respectively y=26.53 and y=26.67 ) but for the rest their photometry is entirely consistent with the z - dropouts selection . in the remaining slits we placed several i - dropout candidates ( see sec 3.2 ) and other interesting objects such as few of the interlopers described in c10a which will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "observations were taken in service mode with the fors2 spectrograph on the eso very large telescope , during july - august 2010 .",
    "we used the 600z holographic grating , that provides the highest sensitivity in the range @xmath19   with a spectral resolution @xmath20 and a sampling of 1.6   per pixel for a 1  slit .",
    "the data presented here come from the co - addition of 86 spectra of 665 seconds of integration each , on a single mask , for a total of 57120 s ( 15.9 hr ) , with median seeing around 0.8 .",
    "the sources have been observed through slitlets 1  wide by 12  long .",
    "series of spectra were taken at two different positions , offset by @xmath21 ( 16 pixels ) in the direction perpendicular to the dispersion .",
    "standard flat - fielding , bias subtraction and wavelength calibration have been applied as in @xcite and f10 .",
    "the sky background has been subtracted between consecutive exposures , exploiting the fact that the target spectrum is offset due to dithering . before combining frames",
    ", particular care has been devoted to the possible offset along the wavelength direction , by measuring the centroids of the sky lines in the wavelength interval 9400 - 9900 .",
    "we have also carried out the sky subtraction by fitting a polynomial function to the background .",
    "the two approaches provide consistent results .    finally , spectra were flux - calibrated using the observations of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "based on the analysis of the standard star observed with the same setup of science targets , we derive that the relative error due to flux calibration is within the 10% .",
    "we expect slit losses to be small , given the extremely compact size of the targets and the excellent seeing during the observations and therefore we neglect them in the subsequent discussion .",
    "we remark that we used exactly the same set up and integration times as in the previous observations , presented in f10 and v11 .",
    "the reduction and calibration procedures employed were also the same : this implies that we have a very homogeneous set of observations and the spectra have a uniform final depth .",
    "in table 1 we present the results for all the z - dropouts observed in the ntt deep field .",
    "the galaxies observed in the goods field were already discussed in f10 .",
    "we also discuss the z - dropouts in the bdf-4 field that were observed but not spectroscopically confirmed ( the two ly@xmath2  emitters at @xmath22 in this field were extensively described in v11 ) .",

    "2007 , vanzella et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in particular they found that 54% of faint ( @xmath37 ) z @xmath1 6 lbgs show relatively strong ( ew @xmath38  ) emission and that a significant fraction ( 27% ) has @xmath39  . for more luminous galaxies ( @xmath40 ) the fractions are lower , but still about 20% of them are detectable as laes .",
    "moreover , by comparing these numbers to analogous samples of lbgs at z@xmath14 and 5 , they determined that there is a strong increase of the ly@xmath2 emission fraction with redshift .",
    "in particular the evolution is very significant for the intermediate ew values with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fraction of lbgs with ly@xmath2  stronger than 25  ( in the original paper @xmath43 ) both for faint and bright galaxies .",
    "the increase is somewhat less pronounced for the brightest emitters with @xmath44  @xcite .",

    "the exception is the object nttdf-1917 that will be considered an interloper from here on and will be excluded from the sample .",
    "this is the same assumption made by s11 , who found negligible contamination for luminous galaxies @xmath47 which make up also the large majority of our sample , rising to only 10% for less luminous sources .",
    "+ in figure  [ starkfig ] we plot the results of s11 together with their predictions for z=7 which were derived by fitting a linear relationship between the fraction of ly@xmath2  emitter and redshift for @xmath45 , and then extrapolating these trends to z@xmath1 7 .    to determine the fraction of galaxies in our sample that belong to each absolute magnitude bin we proceeded in the following way : for the galaxies with confirmed redshift , the absolute @xmath48 was derived from the observed y - band magnitude and the spectroscopic redshift taking into account the effects of ly@xmath2 forest absorption at that redshift and the ly@xmath2  line flux contribution .",
    "they all have @xmath49 .",
    "to assign an absolute magnitude @xmath48 to the remaining 14 galaxies with no spectroscopic confirmation , we proceeded in the following way .",
    "first , we randomly extracted a redshift from the n(z ) distribution function corresponding to our initial z - dropout selection ( see c10a , figure 1 ) . from this random redshift and the observed y - band magnitude we derived @xmath48 .",
    "we repeated this procedure 10000 times for each object and from the obtained @xmath48 distribution , we computed the fraction of galaxies in the two bins @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in figure  [ starkfig ] ( upper panel )",

    "we plot as limits the corresponding fraction for the low luminosity galaxies , where we have no detections .",
    "our points at z@xmath16.9 for the galaxies with @xmath54   are systematically below the expectations derived from s11 for z@xmath55 and are also lower than the observed fractions at z@xmath36 .",
    "we are `` missing '' a consistent number of objects that should show ly@xmath2  with intermediate ews ( between 25   and 55  ) , while the fraction of galaxies with very bright ly@xmath2  emission ( ew @xmath53  ) is consistent with the predictions .",
    "note that this is not a due to a sensitivity limitation of our observations : our ew detection limit is well below @xmath56 for the whole spectral range probed and all galaxies with a broad band y - magnitude brighter than 26.6 , as shown in figure 1 in f10 where we plotted the 10@xmath57 limit of the rest frame ew as a function of redshift achieved by our observations . as we mentioned in section 2 ,",
    "the limiting flux of the bdf and ntt field spectra is exactly the same as for the spectra of the goods - south field presented in f10 .    as a final caveat we point out that we are comparing results at @xmath10 obtained from homogeneous observations ( in terms of set up , integration time and so on ) of a complete sample of galaxies , to results that stark et al .",
    "( 2011 ) derived from a compilation of very heterogeneous observations carried out on different samples .",
    "this could potentially introduce some bias although it is unclear in what direction .",
    "given the small size of the sample we made several tests to estimate the significance of our result .",
    "we assume that the distribution of the ly@xmath2  intensity in galaxies as a function of their rest - frame continuum magnitude @xmath48 does not change significantly from z = 4 - 6 to z = 7 .",
    "we employ the same simulations developed in f10 and extensively described in that paper : briefly , we assume that at @xmath58the ew distribution is represented by a gaussian centered on @xmath59    with an additional constant tail up to 150  , and at @xmath60 by a constant level down to some ewmin value , and null below .",
    "we take the width of the gaussian and the two tails to reproduce the results of v09 and s10 at different rest - frame magnitudes , dividing the sample in two luminosity bins ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) and adjusting the two tails to reproduce the fraction of galaxies with @xmath63  given by s10 ( for more details see f10 ) .",
    "we then compute the probability of detecting n ly@xmath2   lines at a given s / n in our sample .",
    "for each object , we randomly extract a redshift from the c10a distribution , we compute the corresponding @xmath48 from the observed y - band magnitude and then we randomly extract an ew from the corresponding distribution . if the ew is larger than the minimum detectable ew at the corresponding wavelength , we conclude that the object would be detected .",
    "we repeat this procedure 10000 times and in the end we compute the probability of having 3 detections with @xmath64(or 5 detections with @xmath65 ) as observed in our sample .",
    "the results for @xmath66 are presented in figure  [ probability ] .",
    "if we assume that all 14 undetected objects are bona - fide @xmath10 galaxies the probability of finding our result , given the input ew distribution , is extremely low , below 2% . even if we consider a consistent number of interlopers , and randomly eliminate 3 or 4 objects amongst the undetected ones , the probability is still as low as 3 - 6% .",
    "the lower probability values are found if we systematically eliminate the fainter objects from our sample , since according to the input distribution , they are expected show the brightest ly@xmath2  lines .",
    "vice - versa , eliminating all the bright objects , the probability of our results is slightly larger .    to reconcile our observations to the redshift 6 distribution , with a low but acceptable probability ( say @xmath6710% )",
    ", we have to remove @xmath17 candidates from our sample , i.e. assume an interloper fraction of 50% .",
    "note that if we assume different ew distribution , such as the one from stanway et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , our result is even less likely , due to a much higher tail of large ew objects in their sample which we do not observe .    .",
    "[ probability ]    another way to visualize this result is by computing the expected distribution of ews derived using the same simulations described above .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ ewdist ] for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the first case",
    "we expect 9.7 detections and we find 5 . in the second case",
    "we expect 8.2 detection and we have only 3 . in both cases",
    "it is clear that the number of expected detections is significantly higher than what we obtain and that , if the distribution of ew at z=7 was the same as at z=6 , we should have detected more objects with intermediate ew ( in the range 20 - 50  )    we conclude that the discrepancy between the expected ew distribution of z - dropout galaxies and the observed one is statistically significant .",
    "this confirms the results found in f10 , with a sample that is three times as large .    .",
    "our survey shows that there is a significant change in the fraction of ly@xmath2  emitters amongst lbgs at @xmath70 : the trend for the fraction of ly@xmath2  emission in lbgs that is constantly increasing from z@xmath13 to z@xmath16 is stopped or most probably reversed at z@xmath17 .",
    "evidence for a decrease in the fraction of bright ly@xmath2  emission in galaxies at redshift 6.5 and beyond was first claimed by kashikawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who noticed an apparent deficit at the bright end of the ly@xmath2  luminosity function of laes , compared to that observed at @xmath71 . at even earlier epochs ( z@xmath9 ) , ota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) confirmed this significant decrease in lae density with increasing redshift , and interpreted it as due to a combination of galaxy evolution during these epochs and attenuation of the ly@xmath2  photons from laes by the neutral hydrogen possibly left at the last stage of cosmic reionization at z@xmath16 - 7 .",
    "subsequent searches for even higher redshift laes have all been unsuccessful so far ( e.g. clemens et al .",
    "submitted , hibon et al .",
    "however the picture , coming essentially from narrow band surveys for laes is still unclear , since other authors claimed instead that there is hardly any evolution in the density of laes at redshift beyond 7 ( e.g. tilvi et al .",
    "2010 ) or that the evolution is only modest ( ouchi et al .",
    "2010 ) .    as already argued by other authors ( e.g. f10 , ota et al .",
    "2010 ) , the drop in the frequency of bright ly@xmath2  lines in galaxies could be due to different effects ( or a combination of them ) : ( a ) the lbg selection ( z - dropouts ) might suffer from an increasingly higher interloper fraction , such that a considerable number of our spectroscopic targets are not really at @xmath72 but at much lower z ; ( b ) there could be evolution in the intrinsic properties of the lbgs ; ( c ) an increasing neutral fraction of the igm at z@xmath73 6.5 could suppress the ly@xmath2  emission    we find it unlikely that a high fraction of interlopers is present in our sample for the following reasons : our deep spectroscopic observations of i - dropouts ( see section 3.2 ) show that the number of interlopers is actually rather modest , and that most of the objects that usually remain undetected in the spectroscopic surveys are actually at high redshift .",
    "we set a solid upper limit to the fraction of interlopers at @xmath74 of @xmath75 .",
    "the selection of z - dropouts is done along the same lines as the i - dropouts .",
    "great care was put in excluding any possible interloper ( see c10a for details ) such that in the end we actually expect to have rejected a large number of real high redshift galaxies from our sample , rather than include interlopers .",
    "for example for the goods - south field we estimated , though detailed simulations , that our strict selection criteria reject about 30% of real high - z galaxies ( c10a ) , and the fraction is similar or even higher for the other fields .",
    "obviously we can not exclude the possibility that a population of unusual objects are contaminating our sample , but there is no reason why they should not appear also in the i - dropout spectroscopic sample .",
    "evolution in the intrinsic properties of the galaxies , such as an increasing dust content , could also provide an explanation for the missing ly@xmath2  .",
    "however as we go to earlier cosmic epochs we expect to find still younger objects , more metal and dust poor : in this case the production of ly@xmath2  photons should be enhanced and we would expect to find an increasing fraction of ly@xmath2  emitting galaxies ( e.g. shimasaku et al .",
    "indeed galaxies at very high redshift tend to show steep uv slopes ( e.g. v11 , bouwens et al .",
    "2010 ) , consistent with the hypothesis that these are relatively - dust free systems .",
    "alternatively , a very high escape fraction in high z - galaxies could also reduce the intrinsic ly@xmath2  emission ( e.g. dayal et al . 2008 ) . the evolution of the escape fraction at high redshift in unknown at present ( e.g. haardt et al . 2011 , boutsia et al . 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore for relatively high igm neutral gas fraction , the ly@xmath2   does not depend on @xmath76 in a monotonic way ( dayal et al .",
    "2008 ) , since the effect of @xmath76 is not only on the intrinsic ly@xmath2  line but also on the stromgren sphere size and hence on the visibility of the line itself ( see also santos 2004 ) .",
    "for clarity we point out that both santos ( 2004 ) and dayal et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are examples of homogeneous reionization models , in which the galaxy creates its own hii region .",
    "this introduces a direct relation between a galaxy s intrinsic luminosity and it s hii bubble size . in more realistic inhomogeneous reionization models",
    "the hii bubble size is determined mostly by lower mass halos , which host less luminous galaxies .",
    "hence the effects of a higher @xmath76 on the ly@xmath2  visibility is less certain .    here",
    "we therefore attempt to interpret the apparent fast drop in the ` lae fraction ' among lbgs in terms of an evolving neutral hydrogen fraction .",
    "for this we employ the models developed by @xcite , which combine galactic outflow models with large - scale semi - numeric simulations of reionization to quantify the probability distribution function of the fraction of ly@xmath2   photons transmitted through the intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xmath77 .",
    "dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2011 ) derive the @xmath77 by extracting @xmath78 lines - of - sight ( loss ) centered on halos in the mass range , @xmath79 .",
    "this choice of host halo masses was motivated by the uv - derived star formation rate of few(2 - 4 ) @xmath80 of the candidate z=8.6 galaxy by lenhert et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which corresponds to a halo mass of @xmath81 in the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of tran & cen ( 2007 ) .",
    "our galaxies are similar or brighter than this object in uv therefore we assume they are hosted by halo of similar or higher masses .    in dijkstra",
    "( 2011 ) , the observed ew - distribution function at z@xmath36 is modeled as an exponential function which provides a good fit to the observed one at lower redshifts ( e.g. gronwall et al .",
    "2007 ) , with a scale - length that corresponds to the median value observed by stark et al .",
    "( 2010 ) of 50 .",
    "the igm at redshift 6 is assumed 100 per cent transparent to ly@xmath2  photons emitted by galaxies : the ew probability distribution function at @xmath82 is different from that at @xmath74 only because of evolution of the ionization state of the igm .",
    "the simulations assume no dust .",
    "this exercise is repeated for various fractions of neutral hydrogen ( by volume ) , @xmath83 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ dijkstra ] for two models that differ only for the velocity of the outflowing winds assumed ( 25 and 200 km s@xmath27 ) and have the same column density @xmath84 . in case of higher velocity ( black lines ) the transmitted fraction of ly@xmath2  radiation increases ;",
    "the same is true if the column density is increased .",
    "our observations ( blue diamonds ) are consistent with a neutral hydrogen fraction larger than @xmath85 , even assuming that amongst the 14 undetections the fraction of interlopers is as high as 20% , ( green triangles ) . this latter value was chosen assuming the percentage of interlopers at z@xmath9 is equal to the upper limit we derived at z@xmath36 . in the same figure",
    "we also indicate the upper limit derived by stark et al .",
    "( 2011 ) from their undetections at z=7 , given their sensitivity to @xmath86 .",
    "clearly there are many assumptions in the models , not least the fact that the universe is considered completely reionized at z=6 .    for a comparison ,",
    "ota et al . obtained an estimate of @xmath87 from the lack of ly@xmath2  emitters in the deep nb973 survey of the subaru deep field ( ota et al .",
    "2008,2010 ) and using the santos 2004 reionization models .",
    "also , spectral analysis of z @xmath16.3 and 6.7 grbs imply that reionization is not yet complete at these epochs with @xmath88 ( totani et al . 2006 ; but see also mcqueen et al .",
    "2008 for a different analysis ) and @xmath89 ( greiner et al . 2009 ) .",
    "finally the recent observations on the most distant qso known at z=7.08 @xcite where analysed by bolton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who showed that the transmission profile is consistent with an igm in the vicinity of the quasar with a volume averaged hi fraction of @xmath90 .",
    "overall these results , together with the high neutral fraction that we derive , point to a rapid evolution of the neutral fraction of hydrogen in the universe between z@xmath36 and z@xmath9 , in required of the order @xmath6 in a short time ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we have presented and discussed spectroscopic observations of a sample of 20 z - dropout galaxies selected from our deep and wide hawki - i imaging program ( c10a , c10b ) .",
    "we confirm the redshifts of 5 galaxies at @xmath4 , through the presence of a ly@xmath2  emission line .",
    "only two of these galaxies have bright ly@xmath2  and relatively high ews .",
    "the number of galaxies detected in our survey is considerably smaller than what is expected from lower redshift surveys : the trend for an increasing fraction of ly@xmath2   emission in lbgs that was found to hold from redshift 3 to 6 by previous studies ( s11 ) is halted and most probably reverted from z=6 to z=7 .",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic ew distribution of ly@xmath2 is that same at @xmath92 as has been observed at @xmath93 , the discrepancy between the predicted and measured ew distributions in our z - dropout sample is statistically significant",
    ". our result would be marginally consistent with no evolution only if as many as half of the unconfirmed galaxies were interlopers",
    ". the required interloper fraction would be much larger than what we observe in our sample of i - dropouts , where interlopers are less than 18% , as well as what is commonly found in lower redshift samples ( e.g. s10 , v09 ) .",
    "the low detection rate , and the modest ew found can be explained in terms of a rapid evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction from z@xmath36 to z@xmath9 .",
    "assuming that the universe was completely reionized at z=6 , our result point are consistent with a change of neutral hydrogen of the order of @xmath6 in a relatively short time @xmath94 . indeed , there is no evidence at all that the universe is completely ionized at @xmath74 , e.g. mesinger ( 2010 ) argues that , since reionization is expected to be highly inhomogeneous , much of the spectra pass through just the ionized component of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) even for non - negligible values of neutral hydrogen fraction ( volume mean ) ( see also mcgreer et al .",
    "2011 ) however if we want to lower substantially the @xmath95 implied by our observations , then we need the universe at @xmath74 to be substantially neutral(@xmath96% ) .    in any case",
    ", even if the models uncertainties are large , the absence of strong @xmath26 emission lines in our high redshift galaxies is very striking , and together with the very low number of laes found in all recent deep narrow band surveys at z@xmath97 points to some drastic change that took place around that redshift . to better quantify the increase in the hydrogen neutral fraction at these epochs in the near future we will exploit the deep multi - wavelength candels dataset ( grogin et al .",
    "2011 , koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) which will provide large numbers of candidate @xmath98 galaxies for further spectroscopic follow - up campaigns ."
