    "studies of the milky way potential usually involve the construction of dynamical models under a given law of gravity ( e.g. newton s ) .",
    "knowledge about the amount and distribution of mass in our galaxy is typically gained by solving the equations of motion in a given gravitational potential and contrasting the body motions predicted by the theoretical models against the observed kinematics of different sorts of tracers ( i.e. bulk gas motions ; stellar radial velocities and proper motions ) .",
    "statistical tools provide an alternative methodology for inferring the dynamical properties of gravitational systems directly from observational data sets and without an _ a priori _ understanding of the motions of kinematic tracers in the system that is being observed . in this contribution",
    "it will be shown that under some special conditions it is possible to derive statistical inferences about the milky way potential without solving the equations that govern the motion of stars in the galaxy , but by merely assuming that the orbital energy is an integral of motion .",
    "gravity tests can thus be incorporated in the analysis in a quite straightforward manner .",
    "the method of statistical inference outlined here focuses on stellar tidal debris , i.e. stars that are tidally stripped from gravitationally - bound objects .",
    "these stars have a unique dynamical property : although they sample very large volumes of the host s phase - space ( position - velocity ) , their orbits are close to that of the progenitor system .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy provides a dramatic example , as it is currently shedding stars to the milky way halo in the form of a tidal stream that completely wraps around our galaxy ( e.g. koposov et al .",
    "2011b and references therein ) .",
    "it has been extensively shown that the location and kinematics of tidal tails can be used to put strong constraints on the host potential under the assumption that tidal tails follow single orbits ( e.g. law et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ; pearrubia et al . 2005 ; jin & lynden - bell 2007 ; binney 2008 ; eyre & binney 2009 ; koposov et al . 2010 ) .",
    "unfortunately , most tidal debris will be too faint to be detected as coherent over - densities ( e.g. tidal tails , clouds or shells ) in photometric or spectroscopic surveys , either because their progenitors contained a small number of stars , or because the stars were stripped a long time ago .",
    "indeed , the dynamical evolution of tidal debris adds considerable complexity to the detection , follow - up and subsequent dynamical analysis of these systems , for tidally - stripped stars tend to progressively fill the allowed phase - space volume of the progenitor s orbit , becoming in the process kinematically colder and spatially more sparse ( e.g. helmi & white 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , the evolution of tidal debris in the space of integrals of motion is remarkably quiescent . in this space tidally - stripped stars",
    "are distributed tightly about the integrals of motion of the progenitor object regardless of how far in the past the disruption event occurred ; a property that holds even in potentials that vary slowly with time ( pearrubia et al . 2006 ) .",
    "some integrals of motion , like the angular momentum in a spherical potential , are quantities that can be measured directly from phase - space coordinates .",
    "others , like the orbital energy in a static potential , require additional hypothesis of the behaviour of gravity in the milky way .",
    "recently , binney ( 2008 ) found that wrong theoretical assumptions on the milky way potential increase the scatter in the orbital energies inferred from the locations and velocities of individual stars along tidal tails .",
    "this statistical property enables him to construct an algorithm for measuring the galactic potential by minimizing the r.m.s .",
    "energies derived from fitting single orbits to tidal tails .",
    "however , this algorithm relies on the assumption that all stars on the tails have the same orbital energy in the true gravitational potential .",
    "here it is demonstrated that binney s ( 2008 ) results can be extended to tidal debris with arbitrary energy distributions as long as these distributions are separable ( i.e. invariant ) in space .",
    "this assumption may be accurate for stellar streams whose progenitors have low dynamical masses , the so - called cold tidal streams ( pearrubia et al . 2006 ; eyre & binney 2009 ) . also , it will be shown that these systems can be used to measure the milky way gravitational potential as well as to test different gravity theories simultaneously , and without having to integrate the equations of motion .",
    "indeed , our method provides a simple tool to constrain the milky way gravity through a direct inspection of the phase - space coordinates of cold tidal streams , thereby avoiding the daunting task of solving for the dynamics of stars in host galaxies with a generic mass distribution under a suite of gravity theories .",
    "dropping the necessity to fit orbits to the locations and velocities of streams brings a further advantage , namely the fact that our method can be equally applied to phase - space substructures that can be identified as tidal tails , as well as to substructures that have dissolved in the galactic halo , but which may be detected as substructures in the space of integrals of motion , as long as they originate from low - mass progenitors .    before introducing our method",
    "we wish to remark that the technique outlined in this contribution requires full 6d phase - space information . at present",
    "most stars with measured position - velocity vectors are located in the solar neighbourhood , which severely limits its applicability .",
    "however , this unfortunate situation will likely improve in the near future thanks to the advent of gaia , an european mission that will provide astrometric data for more than one billion stars with unprecedented accuracy ( perryman et al .",
    "gaia data in combination with complementary spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. gaia - eso ) is expected to reveal a large number of substructures associated with past accretion events ( brown et al .",
    "2005 ; mateu et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the paper arrangement is as follows : we develop the core idea of our method in  [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "tests are shown in  [ sec : numtest ] .",
    "we go through a brief discussion about applications and limitations in  [ sec : self ] and   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in statistical mechanics , entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible states .",
    "the concept of entropy has been widely used in physics ( e.g. wehrl 1978 ; jaynes 1957 ) to determine the behaviour of macroscopic systems in equilibrium , or close to equilibrium .",
    "for example , galaxies undergoing phase - space mixing tend to evolve toward an energy configuration that maximizes entropy , where @xmath1 is the coarse - grained distribution function , and @xmath2 is any convex function with @xmath3 .",
    "entropy corresponds to the case @xmath4 .    in this work",
    "we are interested in stellar systems that follow a narrow energy distribution and have , by construction , low entropy .",
    "stars that are tidally stripped from gravitationally - bound , low - mass objects and orbit about the host galaxy potential provide an example of systems with low entropy .",
    "given that biases in the theoretical modelling of our galaxy tend to _ increase _ the range of energies sampled by tidal debris ( binney 2008 ) , it appears therefore natural to use entropy as statistically - meaningful quantity to identify those biases .",
    "in addition , entropy has special properties that will help us below to tackle difficult aspects of the study .",
    "for example , its additivity , i.e the fact that the combined entropy of two independent systems equals the sum of the individual entropies ( see  ii.e of wehrl 1978 ) , helps to combine information on the milky way potential gathered from individual debris systems (  [ sec : dh_mult ] ) , as well as to analyze the effects of the progenitor s self - gravity (  [ sec : self ] ) .",
    "it is illustrative to re - interpret binney ( 2008 ) s results in terms of entropy .",
    "consider a suite of @xmath5 stars orbiting in a potential @xmath6 with phase - space coordinates @xmath7 and an orbital energy per unit mass @xmath8 for all @xmath9 , where @xmath10 given that all stars have the same energy in the true potential , the energy distribution follows a dirac s delta function per construction .",
    "binney ( 2008 ) shows that wrong assumptions about @xmath6 must necessarily yield a scattered sample of energies unless all the stars are located at the same position .",
    "the larger the departure from the true underlying potential , the higher the rms variation in energy . using entropy",
    "one would conclude that , since by definition a delta function has an entropy of minus infinity , the entropy of the _ biased _ energy distribution can only increase owing to poor choices in the potential model .",
    "clearly , the stronger the bias the larger the scatter , and thus the higher the measured entropy must be .    in  [ sec",
    ": dh_single ] we extend this principle to stellar systems whose energy distribution @xmath11 is differentiable and separable in energy and space .",
    "mathematically this condition implies that the probability that a star having an energy @xmath12 at a location @xmath13 can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the probability that a star has position @xmath13 . both probability functions are normalized so that @xmath16 .",
    "it is convenient to define the relative potential as @xmath17 , and the relative energy as @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is an arbitrary constant that sets the boundary conditions for the energy distribution @xmath20 .",

    "third , because @xmath47 we find that the change in entropy is fairly sensitive to biases in the potential averaged over the region probed by the tracer population .",
    "this is a remarkable property of the entropy , suggesting that _ minimization of entropy for stellar systems with separable energy distributions provides a powerful method to measure the milky way potential_. cold tidal debris from low - mass progenitors may be an example of such systems because they occupy a reduced volume in the integral - of - motion space , but they sample large volumes of phase - space ( see  [ sec : self ] ) .          in practice",
    "it may prove challenging to isolate the energy distribution of a single population of stellar debris from the milky way background , or from a population of distinct structures overlapping in a given energy range .",

    "the middle and right panels show the variation in entropy and kl - divergence as a function of biases in @xmath109 and @xmath83 .",

    "first , in contrast to the tails entropy ( @xmath213 ) the kl - divergence ( @xmath214 ) finds a _ maximum _ for the unbiased potential @xmath215 . for energies measured in units of @xmath171",
    "we find that the maximum combined kl - divergence is @xmath216 , a value that barely depends on the progenitor mass .",
    "in contrast the combined entropy of the tails in the unbiased potential is @xmath217 and 8.72 for @xmath207 and @xmath208 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the ratio between the combined kl - divergence and the entropy of the tails ( @xmath218 ) is small , which indicates that tidal debris of low - mass objects follow nearly - separable energy distributions .",
    "however , it is worth noting that although this quantity becomes smaller as the progenitor mass decreases , it only vanishes in the limit @xmath219 .    note also that if each of the tails followed a separable energy distribution , then from  [ sec : dh_single ] one should expect @xmath220 in the limit @xmath221",
    ". however , this is clearly not the case .",
    "the reason can be found in the time - variation of the progenitor s self - gravity . as mass stripping progresses the location of the lagrange points l1 and l2 move closer to the centre of the disrupting system , which introduces a dependence between the energy of the particles and the time when they become unbound .",
    "this inevitable effect is responsible for the asymmetric ( and mirrored ) dependence of @xmath222 and @xmath223 as a function of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which is not visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent_4 ] .    finally , the fact that @xmath224 as well as a decreasing function of the energy bias has two undesirable effects .",
    "first , @xmath225 is less sensitive to the presence of biases in the energy calculation than @xmath204 .",
    "second , the condition for minimum entropy @xmath226 , where @xmath227 , is now met for @xmath228 , which yields a local maximum at @xmath229 ; and for @xmath230 , which yields two local minima around @xmath229 .",
    "the progenitor s self - gravity therefore introduces a bias in the minimum entropy method .",
    "for the n - body satellite models explored here , which have dynamical masses @xmath231 and follow eccentric orbits about a milky way - like potential , the bias is fairly small , @xmath232 .",
    "however , notice that the bias does not only depend on the progenitor s self - gravity .",
    "the fact that @xmath233 at @xmath229 implies that the steepness of the function @xmath234 , and thus the location of the two minima , will also depend on the orbit of the progenitor about the host potential that is being inspected .",
    "these results suggest that the effects introduced by the progenitor s self - gravity can be lessened in two ways .",
    "first , one may attempt to minimize the ratio @xmath235 by applying the minimum entropy method to tidal debris that originate from low - mass systems .",
    "in addition , one may derive the probability that a given star belongs either to the leading or trailing tail by inspection of the distribution of debris in the integral - of - motion space .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : kl ] , knowing the membership probability allows a derivation of the crossed - entropy of the individual tails , giving further sensitivity to biases in the host potential .",
    "in this contribution we have introduced the _ minimum entropy method_. this statistical technique is devised to constrain the milky way gravitational potential and test different gravity theories directly from stellar 6d phase - space catalogues and without adopting dynamical models .",
    "our method rests upon two fundamental assumptions : ( 1 ) the gravity theory under study allows for the existence of an orbital energy that is an integral of motion ; and ( 2 ) cold structures in phase - space resulting from the tidal disruption of gravitationally - bound systems have an orbital energy distribution that is separable in energy and space",
    ". then it is shown in  [ sec : entropy ] that any bias in the calculus of the orbital energy ( due to the adoption of an incorrect potential and/or gravity theory ) translates into an increase of the debris entropy .",
    "examining what type of gravity theories obey the first condition goes beyond our current goals , but it is worth considering here in what cases the second condition may not be met .    in  [ sec : self ] we show that the progenitor s self - gravity induces the formation of leading and trailing tidal tails , which occupy different phase - space volumes and follow distinct energy distributions .",
    "because the separability condition is broken , self - gravity introduces a bias in the location of the minimum entropy , thus limiting the application of the method to tidal debris that originate from low - mass systems .",
    "however , the effects of self - gravity can be lessened by deriving the probability that a star in the debris sample belongs either to the leading or trailing tail . with this information at hand",
    "it is possible to quantify systematic variations of the energy distribution in terms of the cross - entropy of individual tails and subtract the contribution of the non - separable term @xmath205 ( the so - called kl - divergence ) from the overall entropy @xmath225 .",
    "the resulting quantity is the combined entropy of the leading and trailing tails @xmath236 , which is more sensitive to biases in the host gravity than the overall entropy .",
    "perturbations on the orbit of a system undergoing tidal disruption may also break the separability of the energy distribution .",
    "for example , a drag force ( e.g. dynamical friction ) acting upon a tidally - disrupting system introduces a dependence between the time when stars are lost to tides and their mean orbital energy .",
    "similarly , interactions with bound substructures lingering in the milky way halo ( e.g. molecular clouds , stellar clusters ) are bound to introduce similar biases in our method . but given that the rate of two - body encounters scales with the progenitor mass ( see e.g.  7.5 of binney & tremaine 2008 ) both effects can be again minimized by applying the minimum entropy method to tidal debris that originate from low - mass systems .    finally , it is well known that observational errors plus the presence of a background in the debris sample may also introduce biases in methods of statistical inference .",
    "for example , on account of our position within the galaxy a systematic increase in the position and velocity errors with heliocentric distance seems unavoidable .",
    "the large number of ways in which errors and systematic biases may arise in phase - space catalogues prevents a generic approach to this problem , being more convenient to inspect this issue in individual cases .",
    "we plan to examine these and other aspects of our method in a forthcoming contribution , where realistic simulations of self - gravitating stellar clusters undergoing tidal disruption will be built by means of n - body techniques .",
    "also , it will prove an exciting exercise to explore to what extent local gravity tests may complement those devised on cosmological scales ( e.g. zhao , peacock & li 2012 ) with help of mock gaia catalogues .",
