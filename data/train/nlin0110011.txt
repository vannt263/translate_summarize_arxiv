    "the study of front propagation of a stable phase into an unstable one encompasses several issues of great interest @xcite as flame propagation in gases @xcite , population dynamics of biological communities ( plankton in oceans ) @xcite and chemical reactions in liquids @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all these phenomena is that they take place in a strongly deformable medium such as a fluid .",
    "the interplay among transport , diffusion and reaction is therefore a crucial problem with several open issues ( e.g. for questions concerning combustion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the most compact model of front propagation the state of the system is described by a single scalar field @xmath4 , that represents the concentration of products .",
    "the field @xmath5 vanishes in the regions filled with fresh material ( the unstable phase ) , equals unity where only inert products are left ( the stable phase ) and takes intermediate values wherever reactants and products coexist , i.e. , in the region where production takes place .",
    "here we assume that the concentration of chemicals does not modify the underlying flow .",
    "therefore , in the following , we consider the velocity field as given .",
    "this approximation , hardly tenable in the context of flame propagation in gases , is rather appropriate for chemical front propagation in some liquid solutions @xcite . under these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath5 is described by @xmath6 where the second term on the l.h.s .",
    "accounts for the transport by an incompressible velocity field . on the r.h.s",
    "the first term describes molecular diffusion and the second one describes the production process with time scale @xmath7 .",
    "we will first consider a production term of fischer - kolmogorov - petrovski - piskunov @xcite ( fkpp ) type , i.e. , a function @xmath8 convex ( @xmath9 ) and positive in the interval @xmath10 , vanishing at its extremes , and @xmath11 .",
    "here we take @xmath12 .",
    "it is also of interest to consider a production term in the form of the arrhenius law , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the activation concentration .",
    "the latter choice is more pertinent to the study of flames and/or chemical reactions @xcite .    until now we did not specify any details of the velocity field . in many engineering applications",
    "@xmath15 is turbulent . in this paper",
    "we investigate front propagation in laminar flows , which , albeit simpler than turbulent ones , show remarkable qualitative similarities with more complex flows @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider a two dimensional stationary incompressible flow with cellular structure ( see also @xcite ) @xmath16 with the streamfunction @xcite @xmath17 we considered @xmath18-periodic boundary conditions in @xmath19 and an infinite extent along the @xmath20-axis .",
    "this kind of flow is interesting because , in contrast to shear flows , all the streamlines are closed and , therefore , the front propagation is determined by the mechanisms of contamination of one cell to the other @xcite . since we are interested in the propagation in the @xmath20-direction , the boundary conditions are set to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the maximum principle ensures that at later times the field still takes values in the range @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous front speed is defined as @xmath24 this expression defines the so - called bulk burning rate @xcite which coincides with the front speed when the latter exists , but it is also a well defined quantity even when the front itself is not well defined .",
    "the asymptotic ( average ) front speed , @xmath25 , is determined by @xmath26 .    in a medium at rest , it is known that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) , for fkpp nonlinearity , generates a front propagating , e.g. , from left to right with an asymptotic speed @xmath27 and a reaction region of thickness @xmath28 @xcite . in the more interesting case of a moving medium",
    ", the front will propagate with an average speed @xmath29 greater than @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the front velocity @xmath29 is the result of the interplay among the flow characteristics ( i.e. intensity @xmath0 and length - scale @xmath18 ) , the diffusivity @xmath31 and the production time scale @xmath7 .",
    "the goal of our analysis is to determine the dependence of @xmath29 on such quantities .",
    "in particular , introducing the damkhler number @xmath32 ( the ratio of advective to reactive time scales ) and the pclet number @xmath33 ( the ratio of diffusive to advective time scales ) , we seek for an expression of the front speed as an adimensional function @xmath34 .",
    "we will see that a crucial role in determining such a function is played by the renormalization of the diffusion constant and chemical time scale induced by the advection @xcite .",
    "moreover , we consider an important limit case , i.e. , the so called geometrical optics limit , which is realized for @xmath35 maintaining @xmath36 constant @xcite . in this limit",
    "one has a non zero bare front speed , @xmath30 , while the front thickness @xmath37 goes to zero , i.e. , the front is sharp . in this regime",
    "the front dynamics is well described by the so - called @xmath38-equation @xcite @xmath39 the front is defined by a constant level surface of the scalar function @xmath40 . physically speaking",
    ", this limit corresponds to situations in which @xmath37 is very small compared with the other length scales of the problem .",
    "also in this case we provide a simple prediction for the front speed , which turns out to be expressible as an adimensional function @xmath41 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we discuss a theoretical upper bound for the front speed which becomes an equality in the limit of ( very ) slow reaction . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we present a numerical study for slow and fast reaction , comparing the results with a phenomenological model . in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we consider the geometrical optics limit .",
    "[ sec:5 ] is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "the appendix contains the details of the numerical method used in the simulations .",
    "for a generic incompressible flow and a generic production term which has a bounded growth rate , @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 it is possible to establish an upper bound for the speed of front propagation .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the effective diffusion coefficient in the @xmath20-direction , which can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) by switching off the production term .",
    "this bound is the consequence of the deeply rooted link existing between front propagation and advective transport .",
    "we start the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : upb ] ) by recalling the fundamental relation among the solution of the pde ( [ eq : rad ] ) and the trajectories of particles advected by a velocity field @xmath46 and subject to molecular diffusion @xcite @xmath47 the average is performed over the trajectories evolving according to the langevin equation @xmath48 with ending point @xmath49 .",
    "the white noise term @xmath50 accounts for molecular diffusion .",
    "+ since the growth rate is bounded , ( [ eq : feykacext ] ) yields the inequality @xmath51 in the previous inequality , the term in angular brackets denotes the probability that the trajectory ending at @xmath52 was initially located at the left of the front interface . for fkpp production term the maximum occurs for @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 . under very broad conditions , i.e. , nonzero molecular diffusivity and finite variance of the velocity vector potential  @xcite , it is possible to show that asymptotically the particles undergo a standard diffusion process with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath55 , always larger than the molecular value @xmath31 .",
    "the issue of single particle diffusion , and the problem of finding the effective diffusivity has been the subject matter of a huge amount of work ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review ) . in the presence of an asymptotic standard diffusion , we can substitute the term @xmath56 , with the gaussian result @xmath57 /\\sqrt{2 \\pi d_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize eff}}\\ , t}$ ] with exponential accuracy .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath58 /\\sqrt{2 \\pi d_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize eff}}\\ , t}$ ] .",
    "it is thus clear that at the point @xmath52 the field @xmath5 is exponentially small until a time @xmath59 of the order of @xmath60 .",
    "we finally obtain the upper bound for the front velocity @xmath61 , which is eq .",
    "( [ eq : upb ] ) .",
    "the bound  ( [ eq : upb ] ) becomes an equality in the limit of very slow reaction . if @xmath7 is the slowest time scale under consideration , advection and molecular diffusion act jointly to build an effective diffusion process , essentially unaffected by the reaction . in this case",
    "the front width is large enough and the reaction takes place in a region of effective diffusivity .",
    "therefore , it is allowed to substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) with an effective reaction - diffusion equation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the eddy - diffusivity tensor @xcite . for the fkpp nonlinearity ,",
    "this last equation gives rise to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "one can find a detailed derivation of this formula in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for cellular flows",
    ", it is known that @xmath66 @xcite . inserting this expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : upb ] ) one obtains @xmath67 @xcite , remarkably close to the observed ones for @xmath68 ( see next section ) .",
    "the bound  ( [ eq : upb ] ) is very general and holds for generic incompressible flows and production terms . here , by means of numerical simulations ,",
    "we consider the front propagation problem arising in the reaction advection diffusion equation  ( [ eq : rad ] ) for the particular case of the cellular flow ( [ eq : stream ] ) of stirring intensity @xmath0 and fkpp nonlinearity ( with characteristic time , @xmath7 ) . in our discussion",
    ", we always suppose that the diffusion time scale is the slowest occurring one , i.e. , @xmath69 and thus @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    now before presenting the numerical results it is helpful to introduce a macroscopic description of the problem which will reduce it to an effective reaction - diffusion process with renormalized coefficients .",
    "the basic observation is that the dynamics of @xmath5 in cellular flows is characterized by the the cell - size @xmath18 , so that we can perform a space discretization that reduces each cell , @xmath72 , to a point , @xmath73 , mapping the domain  a two - dimensional infinite strip  onto a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the field @xmath5 becomes a function defined on the lattice @xmath74 .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) over the cell @xmath72 , we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the flux of matter through the left boundary of the @xmath73-th cell , and @xmath77 is the rate of change of @xmath78 due to reaction taking place within the cell . on the basis of the numerical results ( see below ) , we will show that the space - discretized macroscopic reaction - diffusion equation @xmath79 is a pretty good model for the front dynamics .",
    "the effect of the advective field is to _ renormalize _ the values of the diffusivity , @xmath80 , and the reaction time scale , @xmath81 .",
    "this is why the velocity does not appear any more in the effective dynamics , described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the renormalized diffusivity @xmath45 accounts for the process of diffusion from cell to cell as a result of the nontrivial interaction of advection and molecular diffusion @xcite .",
    "the renormalized reaction time @xmath82 amounts to the time that it takes for a single cell to be filled by inert material , and depends on the interaction of advection and production .",
    "of course , also the production term will be affected , i.e. @xmath83 , but , as we will see , such a modification is not dramatic . indeed",
    ", the modified production term turns always to be in the fkpp universality class .",
    "the limiting speed of the front in the moving medium turns out to be @xmath84 , similar to eq.([eq : upb ] ) @xcite .",
    "the problem is now reduced to derive the expressions for the renormalized parameters by means of physical considerations .    in the following sections , using as an interpretative framework the above described macroscopic model",
    ", we will present the results of detailed numerical simulations for slow ( @xmath85 ) and fast ( @xmath86 ) reaction .      at small @xmath87 ,",
    "the reaction is significantly slower than the advection , and consequently the region where the reaction takes place extends over several cells , i.e. , the front is distributed . to obtain the expression of @xmath45",
    "we neglect the reaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) , which reduces to the equation for a passive scalar in a cellular flow .",
    "this is a well studied problem , the solution of which is @xcite : @xmath88 for large @xmath89 ( @xmath31 small ) the cell - to - cell diffusion mechanism can be qualitatively understood in the following way . the probability , @xmath90 , for a particle to jump across the boundary of the cell , within a circulation time @xmath91 , by virtue of molecular diffusion can be estimated as the ratio of the diffusive motion across streamlines , @xmath92 , to advective motion along streamlines , @xmath93 . as a result @xmath94 , hence the effective diffusivity @xmath95 .    to obtain the expression of the typical time it takes for a whole cell to react ,",
    "let us concentrate on the reaction in a single cell : it is first invaded by a mixture of reactants and products ( with a low content of products , @xmath96 ) on the fast advective time scale ; subsequently complete reaction ( @xmath97 ) is achieved on the slower time scale @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . in this regime ,",

    ", to the maximal one , @xmath104 , as a function of the damkhler number , @xmath87 . for @xmath103 the front propagates with the maximal velocity whereas for @xmath86 the speed slows down with increasing @xmath87 .",
    "the behavior @xmath105 is drawn for reference . ]      we have now to repeat the estimation of @xmath45 and @xmath82 for the fast reaction regime , i.e. , for large @xmath87 .",
    "since we work always in the regime of large peclet numbers , all the above arguments for the effective diffusion still hold , while the effective time scale is different . at large @xmath87 ,",
    "the ratio of time scales reverses , and in a ( now short ) time @xmath7 two sharply separated phases emerge inside the cell . in this regime indeed , the interface is thin compared to the cell size .",
    "the cell filling process is characterized by an inward spiral motion of the outer , stable phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) , at a speed proportional to @xmath0 , as it usually happens for a front in a shear flow at large @xmath87 .",

    "[ fig:5 ] , for small @xmath87 , the effective production term is indistinguishable from the `` bare '' one . increasing @xmath87 , the reaction rate tends to reduce , inducing the slowing - down of the front speed .",
    "for @xmath120 , the effective production term essentially coincides with the microscopic one .",
    "however , there is an intermediate regime characterized by a linear dependence on the cell - averaged concentration , with a slope proportional to @xmath118 .",

    "one simply integrates numerically both @xmath5 and @xmath8 at a fixed time over a cell volume .",
    "it is worth to remark that , notwithstanding the change of shape of the effective chemical potential , the production term remains in the fkpp universality class .",
    "let us stress that what we call fast reaction regime is still not in the geometrical optics limit . indeed , to obtain this limit it is not sufficient to take @xmath7 small , but one has to take also @xmath31 small in such a way that @xmath124 is constant",

    "when the front thickness and the reaction time are much smaller than the length and time scales of the velocity field fluctuations one has the geometrical optics regime @xcite . in this case the front is a sharp interface separating the reactants from the products , and can be modeled in the framework of the @xmath38-equation  ( [ eq : optics ] ) @xcite . physically speaking ,",
    "one uses the @xmath38-equation when the front thickness is very thin and it is hard to resolve the diffusive scale .",
    "as far as the cellular flow is concerned , the front border is wrinkled by the velocity field during propagation and its length increases until pockets of fresh material develop  @xcite .",

    "the problem addressed here is the dependence of the effective speed @xmath29 on the flow intensity , @xmath0 , and the bare velocity , @xmath30 , that is expected of the form @xcite : @xmath143 where @xmath144 ) is a function which depends on the flow details .    as far as we know ,",
    "apart from very simple shear flows ( for which @xmath145 @xcite ) , there are no methods to compute @xmath146 from first principles .",
