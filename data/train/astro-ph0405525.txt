    "one of the most outstanding problems in present - day models of the energy release in @xmath1-ray bursts ( grb ) relates to the conversion of the liberated energy into observed electromagnetic radiation . in relativistic fireball models",
    ", the pressure of the photon - lepton plasma itself leads to relativistic expansion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "baryons are then accelerated through their coupling to the electrons . at a more basic level",
    ", the origin of the expanding fireball requires a definitive source of energy release that may itself be a source for mass acceleration . @xcite and",
    "@xcite discuss the formation of relativistically expanding jets from hyperaccreting , stellar - mass black holes that are formed as a consequence of iron core collapse of a rotating , massive ( @xmath2 ) star .",
    "alternative models for the extraction of rotational ( disk and black hole ) energy and its conversion to expanding shells or jets involve magnetohydrodynamic processes , including reconnection and dynamo operation in the accretion disks ( e.g , @xcite ) .    the most direct evidence for the presence of magnetic fields in grb comes from their emission spectrum which is now widely interpreted in terms of synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "whether there is a direct connection between magnetic fields produced in the immediate environment of the grb or the precursor star and the fields that are , at much larger distances , responsible for the observed synchrotron emission is not clear .",
    "@xcite argue that the required field strengths _ for grb afterglow shocks _ exceed those to be expected from dragging a pre - existing progenitor field along the expanding shell , and that they also exceed field strengths that could be produced by compression of interstellar magnetic fields . a field - generating mechanism intrinsic to the shocks",
    "would thus be required .",
    "the situation is , however , less clear for the prompt grb emission .",
    "the recent report @xcite of strong linear polarization in the _ prompt _ @xmath1-ray emission from grb021206 @xcite therefore stirred some excitement .",
    "the observations were performed with the rhessi satellite @xcite . from extensive",
    "modeling , the authors derived a polarization degree of @xmath3% , compatible with the assumption of maximum polarization .",
    "the emitting electrons are commonly thought to be accelerated in collisionless shocks by the fermi mechanism to a energy distribution , @xmath4 , with typically @xmath5 . in that case",
    ", standard synchrotron theory predicts that the intrinsic polarization degree @xmath6 is a function of @xmath7 , namely @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this value therefore constitutes a maximum for a homogeneous magnetic field . for @xmath9 , one",
    "thus finds @xmath10 .",
    "tangled magnetic fields with different field vectors relative to the line of sight will in general reduce @xmath6 .",
    "the implications of these observations are far - reaching : not only does this observation further support the synchrotron radiation model , it also seems to require nearly homogeneous magnetic fields over the source visible to the observer ( a solid angle of @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite argue that magnetic fields dragged by the expanding shell from the surface of the exploding object are too weak to produce the prompt grb , requiring additional turbulent shock - generated fields that , however , would produce unpolarized emission .",
    "therefore , they suggest that the magnetic fields produced in the central engine are responsible for driving the fireball themselves . alternatively , post - shock dynamos could generate the highly ordered magnetic fields ; but then it will have to be shown that the instabilities occur on large spatial scales @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the pulse - averaged polarization degree for a relativistically expanding shell that contains a global toroidal field .",
    "the synchrotron emission is again assumed to be from power - law distributed electrons .",
    "their calculations predict a maximum of 60% for the polarization fraction , depending on the spectral parameters of the grb .",
    "this view is not unequivocal .",
    "@xcite points out that a slight off - axis orientation of the relativistically expanding jet produces a strong linear polarization signal even in the presence of random magnetic fields . for further views on this",
    ", we refer to the summary in lyutikov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references cited therein .    in any case , the prospect of diagnosing magnetic field structures in the very emission region of the prompt grb deserves upmost attention . @xcite have reanalyzed the rhessi data of grb021206 and cast serious doubts on the polarization measurements reported earlier by @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that the signal reported by @xcite is either spurious or is not related to polarization , and they claim that no statistically meaningful statement can be made for the degree of linear polarization for this particular grb .",
    "we have reanalyzed grb021206 and find problematic issues in both previous analyses .",
    "we find , in line with @xcite , clear evidence that much of the signal claimed by @xcite is induced not by source polarization but by accidental coincidences of two unrelated photons arriving at the same time in two different detectors .",
    "we essentially confirm the null results of @xcite , but we present a polarization analysis that compares simultaneous scattering rates of orthogonal detector pairs and thus does not need a complicated normalization .",
    "additionally , after implementing photon polarization in the geant3 software , we made extensive simulations of rhessi s response to a fully polarized grb .",
    "we also add one further grb to this analysis , again finding no statistically significant evidence for non - zero polarization .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : we start with a description of the rhessi satellite and its relevant features for polarization analysis in  [ sec : rhessi ] .",
    "next , we present the rhessi data of grb021206 in  [ sec : data ] . in our data analysis (  [",
    "sec : method ] ) , we first select coincidence events (  [ sec : c_types ] ) , before we search for a polarization signal in  [ sec : polanal ]",
    ". then , in  [ sec : simul ] , we present our simulations of a fully polarized grb .",
    "the results of the polarization analysis of grb021206 are presented in  [ sec : results ] , together with the results from our simulation of a fully polarized grb .",
    "after a quick look at grb030519b - another candidate for polarization analysis - we compare our analysis with previous works (  [ sec : comp ] ) and discuss in general the suitability of rhessi as a grb - polarimeter in  [ sec : req ] .",
    "the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi , @xcite ) is a nasa small explorer ( smex ) mission that was launched on 2002 february 5 into a low earth orbit ( 600 km altitude , @xmath12 inclination ) .",
    "rhessi s primary science goal is to study solar flares in x - rays and gamma rays by using high resolution imaging spectroscopy .",
    "the mission is equipped with a single instrument made up of two main systems : an imager and a spectrometer .",
    "the imager @xcite consists of a 1.5@xmath13 m long tube with a set of 9 grids mounted on the front end of the tube and an identical set mounted on the rear end .",
    "the system makes use of the rotational modulation principle to obtain images of solar flares @xcite .",
    "rhessi rotates with a period of @xmath14s and points always towards the sun .",
    "the spectrometer consists of nine large germanium detectors cooled to 75@xmath13k .",
    "only weak lateral shielding was applied around the ge - detectors .",
    "this causes rhessi to be an all sky monitor for photons with energies above roughly 50@xmath13kev .",
    "thus , in addition to solar observations , rhessi is also suited for grb observations .",
    "the arrangement of rhessi s nine coaxial germanium detectors is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dets ] .",
    "they have a diameter of 7.1@xmath13 cm and a height of 8.5@xmath13 cm each .",
    "the cylinders are electrically segmented in a thin front segment ( about 1.5@xmath13 cm thick ) and a thick rear segment ( about 7@xmath13 cm thick ) , for details see @xcite . in reality",
    "the values of the front versus rear thickness may vary significantly from detector to detector .",
    "the front segments are able to detect photons from 3@xmath13kev to 2.7@xmath13mev with a resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath15 1@xmath13kev ( at 100@xmath13kev ) , while the rear segments are sensitive from about 20@xmath13kev to 17@xmath13mev with a resolution of @xmath15 3@xmath13kev ( at 1@xmath13mev ) .",
    "a shielding plate with holes for the detectors is placed on top of the cryostat which protects the rear segments from solar photons scattered in the cryostat materials .",
    "similar graded z cylinders surround the front segments and protect them from low energy background photons ( @xmath16kev ) coming from the side .    with respect to grb observations , rhessi s",
    "detection threshold depends on the effective shielding encountered by the incoming gamma rays . in the particular case of grb021206 , which was located at an angle of @xmath17 with respect to the sun s direction ,",
    "the lower threshold of the rear segments was about 100@xmath13kev .",
    "this is mainly caused by absorption in the front segments and in the grid structures of the imager , absorption in the shielding plate , and absorption in the support modules located on the spacecraft equipment deck ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hessi ] ) .",
    "these support modules are placed with a symmetry of @xmath18 in order to balance the spacecraft .",
    "the uneven mass distribution of the support modules together with the rotation of rhessi leads to a periodic variability of the detection threshold , especially for grbs coming in under such a small polar angle .",
    "rhessi was originally designed to measure linear polarization of hard x - rays from the sun with the help of a be scatterer mounted in the plane of the spectrometer @xcite .",
    "solar photons pass through predefined holes in the imager tube and , after compton scattering in the be block , are detected in the neighboring rear segments . for compton polarimetry of gamma rays coming from non - solar sources ( and therefore missing the holes for the be scatterer ) , one rather uses coincidence measurements between two detectors , one of which works as a scatterer .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of the compton scattered photons depends on the photon polarization : polarized photons are preferentially scattered in the direction perpendicular to the initial polarization direction .",
    "this azimuthal modulation is maximal for scattering angles of about @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , rhessi s polarization sensitivity is highest for photons approaching the satellite from directions perpendicular to the detector plane , i.e. close to its rotation axis ( as was the case for grb021206 ) .",
    "the coincidence rate of two detectors is a function of the angle between the photon polarization direction and the line through the detector centers .",
    "as this angle changes with the rotation of the satellite , the coincidence rate may exhibit a characteristic modulation pattern .",
    "its amplitude is proportional to the polarization degree , and its period is @xmath19 .",
    "the maximum amplitude that a 100% polarized grb would produce is an intrinsic function of the instrument and is obtained from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the detector signals are amplified by charge - sensitive preamplifiers before being sent to the instrument data processing unit ( idpu ) for further analog and digital processing : amplification , digitalization , time stamping etc .. there are eighteen independent readout channels , one for each detector segment .",
    "each detected event is defined by its detector number and segment , its arrival time and its energy channel .",
    "the event time is measured in units of binary microseconds ( @xmath20b@xmath21s@xmath22s ) .",
    "the absolute time is known with an accuracy of a few milliseconds .",
    "the data are stored event by event in the onboard memory .    at the time of the grbs studied here ,",
    "front and rear segments of detector 2 were coupled .",
    "its energy resolution is therefore much worse ( @xmath23kev at @xmath24kev ) .",
    "the readout of detector 2 was provided only via the front channel .    in order to save onboard memory , an automatic `` decimation '' procedure",
    "is applied to events in the rear segments : only one out of @xmath25 rear events is stored for energies below a predefined threshold .",
    "this rear decimation is switched on mainly when the spacecraft is at high magnetic latitudes , where electron precipitation and cosmic ray background are high .",
    "this was the case during grb021206 with @xmath26 and energy channels below 1024 ( @xmath27kev ) .",
    "we developed our own routines for the polarization search .",
    "the basic data structure we use is the event list that contains for each detected photon its arrival time , its energy and the corresponding detector segment number .",
    "the basic analysis steps are described below .",
    "the light curve of grb021206 , extracted from the event list for all entries with energies @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltc ] . for the polarization analysis , we selected a time interval that corresponds to exactly one rotation of rhessi ( dashed lines in fig .  [ fig : ltc ] ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the photon arrival time since 2002 december 6 22:49:00 ut .",
    "we find a total of about @xmath31 photons in this time interval and energy band . the corresponding energy spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : rspec ] ( summed over all detectors and segments ) .",
    "the step around 380 kev is due to decimation in the rear segments .",
    "the 511 kev line originates from positron creation and annihilation in the spacecraft and the atmosphere .",
    "the total numbers of counts in each detector segment are listed in table [ tab : counts ] , using the time and energy interval of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ t0_cut ] ) .",
    "detector 2 has no rear counts and a high total count rate since it is treated as an undecimated front segment .",
    "the number of counts in the other detectors varies significantly , especially in the front segments , whose thicknesses are different from detector to detector .",
    "a photon that is compton scattered from one detector into another one makes signals in two detectors , and thus makes two coincident entries ( indices @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) in the event list .",
    "naively , one would expect the real coincidences to happen within the same binary microsecond .",
    "it turns out , however , that real coincidences in the rhessi data can have a time difference @xmath34 up to @xmath35b@xmath21s ( see below ) .",
    "compton scattering is the most important interaction of photons with germanium at energies from 150@xmath13kev up to a few mev .",
    "the energy @xmath36 of a compton scattered photon is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the initial photon energy , @xmath39 the electron mass and @xmath40 the scattering angle between in- and out - going photon .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath41 of the recoil electron is @xmath42 for a 150@xmath13 kev photon that makes a compton scattering with @xmath43 the energy of the recoil electron is @xmath44kev . in our observation",
    ", low energy noise dominates below about 15 kev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rspec ] ) .",
    "we therefore require for the energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 of a coincidence pair ( `` energy cut '' ) : @xmath47 if we assume that the total energy of the scattered photon is measured in one of the ge detectors , and the total energy @xmath41 of the recoil electron in the other one , we can calculate the scattering angle @xmath40 from the above equation ( [ eq : compton ] ) , namely @xmath48 by taking into account the geometry of the detectors and the space in between we allow @xmath40 within @xmath49 .",
    "this rather generous angle range corresponds to @xmath50 . for each event pair ( energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 )",
    "we can therefore apply an additional energy cut ( `` kinematical cut '' ) , namely @xmath51 because we do not know which detector observed the scattered photon and which one the recoil electron , we have to test both combinations .",
    "concerning the accepted detector pairs , we distinguish between spatially _ close _ and _ distant _ detector pairs , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dets ] . among the 36 possible pairs we have 19 close and 17 distant pairs .",
    "the chance of a real compton scattered event between distant detectors is considerably smaller than between close detectors . for pairs like e.g. detectors 2 and 6 , it is essentially zero because detector 7 is located in between .",
    "since the mean free path of a compton scattered photon is about 1 to 2@xmath13 cm , it would be stopped or scattered in detector 7 .",
    "indeed , when the analysis was performed with the distant detector pairs only , an insignificant number of compton scattering candidates was found ( see section [ sec : distant ] ) .",
    "the acceptance of only close detector pairs is called `` close pairs cut '' .    in order to find the time difference @xmath52 of _ real _ coincidences , we study the number of pairs as a function of @xmath52 for _ any _ two events ( not only two consecutive entries in the event list ) fulfilling ( [ t0_cut ] ) and ( [ e0_cut ] ) , and occurring in a pair of close detectors . fig .  [",
    "fig : dtplot ] shows six plots which represent the possible combinations between the involved electronics ( f : front segments , r : rear segments , and 2 : the unsegmented detector 2 ) .",
    "rf , for instance , stands for pairs for which one signal occurred in a rear segment and the other in a front segment , and @xmath52 is defined as the time difference between front and rear .",
    "negative @xmath52-values indicate cases where the front signal occurred earlier than the rear signal . in order to obtain positive and negative time differences in the cases of rr or ff pairs",
    ", we arbitrarily choose to subtract the time of the detector with the lower number from the time of the partner with the higher number .",
    "this does not affect our further analysis .",
    "rr,2xdec stands for coincidences between two rear segments , where both energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 are within the decimated range .",
    "the structure in the @xmath52-plot of the rr,2xdec - pairs shows a period of @xmath53b@xmath21s , which is due to the decimation procedure with @xmath54 .",
    "decimation in the rear segment works like a clocked veto @xcite : during @xmath20b@xmath21s , the events in all detectors are accepted , during the next @xmath55b@xmath21s they are all rejected .",
    "the real coincidences are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtplot ] .",
    "we find that they appear at different time differences @xmath52 , mainly at : @xmath56 these time bins are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtplot ] by the vertical gray lines , and they are used as `` @xmath52-cut '' .",
    "coincidences outside these time bins are accidental coincidences .",
    "we think that the different @xmath52 are caused by different delays in the readout channels : the rear segment electronics is fastest , the time stamp in the front segments is on average @xmath57b@xmath21s later , and detector 2 is about @xmath58b@xmath21s later .",
    "the high photon rate during grb021206 introduces numerous accidental coincidences .",
    "their rate can be determined from fig .  [",
    "fig : dtplot ] .",
    "we use the accidental coincidences with @xmath59b@xmath21s @xmath60 @xmath61b@xmath21s ( so - called `` time shifted coincidences '' ) and interpolate them around @xmath62 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dtplot ] ) . the time differences @xmath63 used to estimate the number of accidentals should on the one hand be higher than the longest readout time of the events , i.e. , longer than a few b@xmath21s . on the other hand , it should be smaller than the shortest time scale of variability in the grb light curve .",
    "the total number of coincidences ( @xmath64 ) as well as the number of accidental coincidences ( @xmath65 ) can be determined for any time interval , leading to time dependent functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the number @xmath67 is proportional to the square of the total count rate , and therefore shows a strong time variation .",
    "some of the real coincidences observed during the grb are induced by various background components .",
    "we call this number @xmath68 . it could show a rotation angle dependent time variation and can be estimated by interpolation of the data before and after the grb : @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes a time bin before and @xmath71 a time bin after the grb , with equal rotation angle of rhessi as at time @xmath72 .",
    "the remaining number of coincidences , namely @xmath73 are called `` compton scattering candidates '' and includes the real compton scattering events",
    ".    a closer look at all the close detector pairs that fulfill the energy cut ( [ e0_cut ] ) , the kinematical cut ( [ e_special ] ) , and and the @xmath52-cut ( [ dt_cut ] ) shows that many of them are part of a multiple coincidence ( 3 or more detector segments firing at the same time ) .",
    "it often happens that a photon undergoes a forward compton scattering in a front segment before being compton scattered in the rear segment into a neighboring detector .",
    "in other cases , several detectors observe a signal .",
    "this is relatively more often the case before and after the grb .",
    "multiple coincidences can be caused by nuclear reactions , bremsstrahlung , or pair / photon cascades originating from the passage of high energy cosmic rays through the spacecraft .",
    "none of these multiple coincidences contribute to a polarization signal .",
    "we therefore do not accept them .",
    "we identify multiple coincidences by looking at all accepted coincidences .",
    "let @xmath74 be the time of a coincidence , more exactly , the earlier time of the two events involved .",
    "two coincidences are members of a multiple coincidence if @xmath75b@xmath21s .",
    "all coincidences that fulfill this condition are rejected ( so - called `` no - multiples cut '' ) .",
    "however , members of multiple coincidences are also members of time shifted coincidences used to determine the number of accidental coincidences . in order to obtain the correct number of accidental coincidences , we clean the initial event list from members of multiple coincidences .",
    "we then search again for real and time shifted coincidences .      in order to search for a polarization signal",
    "we first note that all close detector pairs can naturally be grouped into four scattering directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dets ] ) , each separated by @xmath76 .",
    "according to a rhessi - fixed coordinate system , we call these directions the @xmath77 direction , the @xmath76 direction , the @xmath18 direction , and the @xmath78 direction . the true pair angles , measured from detector center to detector center , vary slightly . the mean deviation from the nominal value",
    "is @xmath79 with a maximum of @xmath80 .",
    "this is much less then the width of scattering angles accepted by a detector pair , which is of the order @xmath81 .",
    "assuming that polarized photons at a time @xmath82 were scattered preferentially in the @xmath78 direction , then , one eighth of a satellite rotation later , they would be scattered preferentially in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "after another rotation by @xmath76 , they would be scattered in the @xmath76-direction , and so on .",
    "we determine the number of compton scattering candidates for the 4 scattering directions and call them @xmath83 , with @xmath84 \\ { 0 , 45 , 90 , 135 } . for a grb with a strongly varying light curve , such as grb021206 ,",

    ". the maximum possible synchrotron polarization degree would , for the measured spectral index of the burst , be of order 70% , fully compatible with the data .",
    "we conclude that _ no statement on @xmath1-ray polarization can be made for grb021206_.    our result contradicts the statements of @xcite , who find more than 9000 compton scattering candidates ( @xmath169 ) and claim to see a polarization signal at the 5.7@xmath165 level .",
    "the main problem in their analysis is the number of accidental coincidences ( @xmath65 ) that is , in our view , not determined correctly .",
    "@xcite obtain their signal by comparing a measured `` angular light curve '' with simulations of an unpolarised grb .",
    "if they do not use a correct @xmath218-ratio in their simulation , then the presented simulated data points can not be trusted .",
    "our result agrees in many aspects with the reanalysis presented by @xcite . by making a more sophisticated coincidence selection ,",
    "we obtain much smaller errors , however .",
    "a few points of caution in the polarization analysis of @xcite have been mentioned in our presentation .",
    "we therefore conclude that rhessi has not yet measured the degree of polarization of any observed grb .",
    "implications on magnetic field orientation based on rhessi results are therefore premature , and the physics of magnetic field generation and structure in the @xmath1-ray source of grb must rely on alternative information for the time being . on the other hand , our analysis suggests that at least in principle , rhessi does offer the capability of measuring polarization . a grb with comparable fluence as grb021206 , but lasting @xmath219s , would be required to significantly distinguish maximum polarization of a grb from zero polarization .",
    "in addition , a grb suitable for polarization analysis should come from a direction close to rhessi s rotation axis .",
