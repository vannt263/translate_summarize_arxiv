    "we investigate distribution properties of two - dimensional hybrid sequences composed of a certain one - dimensional niederreiter sequence and a one - dimensional kronecker sequence with parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the niederreiter sequence is constructed as follows .",
    "we fix an infinite matrix @xmath5 over @xmath6 , a so - called _ generating matrix _ , as the identity whose first row is perturbed by a sequence @xmath14 in @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath15 furthermore , for each non - negative integer @xmath16 we assemble the dyadic digits of its binary expansion @xmath17 into the vector @xmath18 and compute @xmath19 modulo @xmath20 .",
    "subsequently , we define the @xmath16th element of our niederreiter sequence @xmath21 as    @xmath22    obviously , this construction principle can be generalized by not imposing a specific structure on @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it can be extended to produce @xmath23-dimensional sequences , @xmath24 , by employing @xmath23 generating matrices @xmath25 , one for each dimension .",
    "these generalizations give rise to _",
    "digital sequences _ in the sense of niederreiter @xcite . the main motivation for considering these sequences is revealed in dimension 1 already .",
    "namely , if @xmath5 is non - singular then each dyadic interval contains a _",
    "fair _ share of the number of elements . more specifically ,",
    "if @xmath26 with non - negative integers @xmath27 then it contains @xmath28 points from any segment of @xmath29 consecutive elements of the sequence . here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for every @xmath32 .",
    "in our setting ( [ eqn : c ] ) the term _ non - singular _ may of course be rephrased by @xmath33 . the most generic case one can probably think of is putting @xmath34 . the result of the above construction scheme is better known as _ halton sequence _ in base @xmath20 in this case . observe that it may also be interpreted as reflecting the dyadic digits of every @xmath16 at the comma position , i.e. , @xmath35 for each @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 is of a more complicated structure it imposes an additional scrambling on @xmath38 , which may also be seen as a _ perturbation _ of the first dyadic digit of @xmath39 .",
    "hence , we refer to niederreiter sequences which are generated by matrices of the form ( [ eqn : c ] ) as _ perturbed halton sequences_. for the sake of completeness we mention that the @xmath40th coordinate of the @xmath16th point @xmath39 of a @xmath23-dimensional halton sequence in bases @xmath41 is constructed by reflecting the @xmath42-adic digits of @xmath16 at the comma .    a kronecker sequence is defined as the sequence of fractional parts @xmath43 , where @xmath2 is irrational .",
    "again , this sequence admits a multidimensional analogue . consider a vector @xmath44 such that @xmath45 are linearly independent over the rationals .",
    "then the @xmath23-dimensional kronecker sequence is given by @xmath46 .",
    "we intend to use perturbed halton ",
    "kronecker sequences to _ approximate _ uniform distribution on the unit square @xmath47 .",
    "the _ star discrepancy _ serves as a quality measure for how evenly such a sequence is distributed . for the first @xmath29 elements of a sequence @xmath48 in @xmath49 it is defined as @xmath50^{d}}\\frac{1}{n}\\big|{\\mathcal{a}}_n({\\mathcal{s}},[\\boldsymbol{0},\\boldsymbol{x}))-n\\lambda_{d}([\\boldsymbol{0},\\boldsymbol{x } ) )     \\big|,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 denotes the @xmath23-dimensional lebesgue measure of the interval @xmath52 and where @xmath53 counts the number of elements of the initial segment of @xmath54 of size @xmath29 which lie in @xmath55 .",
    "if it is clear from the context which sequence we consider , we may omit the respective argument .",
    "certainly , this entity can be extended to unanchored intervals as well . for an extensive survey on @xmath56 and the sequences involved we refer to the books @xcite .    within this paper",
    "we confine ourselves to @xmath57 . in this case",
    "it is known that @xmath58 for all sequences @xmath54 and infinitely many @xmath29 and an absolute constant @xmath59 .",
    "the existence of @xmath60 is due to a break - through by bilyk and lacey in 2008 ( see @xcite ; for @xmath61 see @xcite ) and was recently quantified by the second author in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , examples of sequences are known which satisfy the essentially same upper bound , but with @xmath62 . in dimension",
    "@xmath63 the exact order of the star discrepancy is known and originally due to schmidt @xcite ( 1972 ) .",
    "he showed @xmath64 another proof of this result was later given by halsz @xcite ( 1981 ) and , more recently , by larcher in @xcite and by larcher and the second author in @xcite , where the last two papers additionally emphasize on finding the optimal constant @xmath65 in the above estimate .",
    "we need to point out that all of the @xmath23-dimensional examples that are known to satisfy an upper bound of the star discrepancy with @xmath66 are of a _ pure _ type .",
    "well - established examples are specific digital sequences such as sobol sequences @xcite , faure sequences @xcite , niederreiter sequences @xcite , niederreiter",
    " xing sequences @xcite as well as multi - dimensional halton sequences @xcite .",
    "individually , the perturbed halton sequence as well as the kronecker sequence are subject to the optimal bound @xmath67 if @xmath33 in the perturbing sequence @xmath68 and if , e.g. , @xmath11 has bounded continued fraction coefficients , respectively . for more details on these sequences and its discrepancy the reader is referred to the monographs @xcite .",
    "hybrid sequences are built by juxtaposing pure sequences to higher dimensional sequences and were the subject of various recent papers @xcite .",
    "prior to these , hybrid sequences that are built by combining low - discrepancy sequences and ( pseudo)-random sequences were suggested by spanier @xcite to overcome the curse of dimension in quasi - monte carlo methods . for results on such hybrid sequences see for example @xcite",
    ". a famous and well studied combination of two types of pure low - discrepancy sequences are the halton",
    " kronecker sequences ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . combinations of different low - discrepancy sequences are interesting objects as they are candidates for new classes of low - discrepancy sequences and since they often raise intriguing number theoretical problems . the study of halton  kronecker sequences , for example , gives rise to the question for a @xmath69-adic analog of the thue ",
    "roth theorem which was established by ridout @xcite and , for instance , to the need of real numbers @xmath11 that have bounded continued fraction coefficients on the one hand , and an explicitely specifiable binary representation on the other ( examples of such numbers were discovered by shallit @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to the halton ",
    "kronecker sequences , niederreiter ",
    "kronecker sequences appear to be objects which are particularly hard to study .",
    "qualitative results on their discrepancy can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this paper reveal quantitative information of such sequences .",
    "we consider periodic perturbing sequences with period length @xmath9 of the form @xmath70 and denote the resulting niederreiter sequence by @xmath71 .",
    "finally , the hybrid sequence we are interested in is given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",
    "the special case where @xmath5 is the identity is referred to as @xmath74 , which was studied by niederreiter @xcite , and by the first author together with drmota and larcher @xcite and its optimal metric behavior was proven by the first author together with larcher in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as it was already mentioned , individually , the components of our compound sequence are very well distributed .",
    "their interplay , however , displays a more ambivalent behavior : in some cases the sequence behaves essentially optimal , while in others it behaves significantly worse .",
    "moreover , the transition from _ good _ to _ bad _ is somehow",
    "_ discontinuous_.    let us now quantify the statements from the above paragraph .",
    "to this end we require some notation . in what follows",
    "we write @xmath75 if @xmath76 for all @xmath29 large enough and @xmath77 if @xmath78 for infinitely many @xmath79 ; here @xmath80 is a constant exclusively depending on a collection of parameters indicated by @xmath81 .    furthermore , we want to point out that it is not our primary concern to determine the exact order of the logarithmic term in our discrepancy estimates . note that it is not clear from the outset that we can expect @xmath82 to be the exponent of @xmath29 . for instance , for the combination of the perturbed halton sequence with @xmath83 with the pure halton sequence in base @xmath84",
    " both sequences satisfy optimal one - dimensional discrepancy bounds  it is known that @xmath85 see @xcite .",
    "thus , we will put our main emphasis on the exponent of @xmath29 in all that follows , while the @xmath86 part will be taken care of by adding / subtracting an arbitrarily small @xmath87 to / from the exponent of @xmath29 .",

    "details on @xmath97 can be found in remark  [ rem:41 ] after the proof of the theorem .",
    "the primary interest , however , lies in @xmath11 s with bounded continued fraction coefficients , since the kronecker component satisfies an optimal discrepancy bound in this case .",
    "[ rem:1 ] the limit case @xmath98 was recently investigated by the first author together with larcher and drmota @xcite , who obtained @xmath99 for every @xmath2 with bounded continued fraction coefficients ( see also niederreiter @xcite ) .",

    "it is easily seen that _",
    "evil kronecker sequences _ , which were studied by the first author together with aistleitner and larcher in @xcite and are denoted by @xmath103 , are directly linked to @xmath104 .",
    "several techniques of our proof reach back to this paper . here , the sequence of _ evil numbers _",
    "@xmath105 denotes the increasing sequence of non - negative integers whose sum of dyadic digits is even .",
    "similarly , it turns out in the proof of theorem  [ thm : genlower ] that the sequence @xmath106 related to @xmath72 is the increasing sequence of non - negative integers with an even sum of digits in base @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath108    concerning the sharp exponent @xmath95 in theorem  [ thm : genupper ] and theorem  [ thm : genlower ] above some remarks are in order .",
    "prior to this paper , two results for specific @xmath9 are known to the authors , namely @xmath109 ( see  @xcite ) and @xmath98 ( see remark  [ rem:1 ] ) . in the first case",
    "an exponent of @xmath110 is obtained .",
    "apparently , this coincides with @xmath111 .",
    "hence , the current paper can be seen as an extension of @xcite . in the second case , i.e. @xmath98 , remark  [ rem:1 ] states an exponent of @xmath112 .",
    "hence , naturally one would expect @xmath95 to decrease from @xmath113 to @xmath112 .",
    "surprisingly , the opposite is the case : @xmath95 increases w.r.t .",
    "this means that if the density of @xmath7 s in the first row of our generating matrix @xmath5 decreases , the best possible bound for the star discrepancy of the hybrid sequence grows .",
