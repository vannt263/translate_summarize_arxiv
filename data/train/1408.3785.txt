    "we can see that @xmath77 and @xmath78 , therefore the system operates in the resolved - sideband regime , which is beneficial for the electromechanically induced transparency . in",
    "what follows , we investigate the microwave response of this coupled system in the two cases of equal and different mechanical frequencies separately .",
    "first , we consider the case in which the resonance frequencies of the two mechanical oscillators are the same , i.e. , @xmath79 mhz .",
    "in addition , their optomechanical coupling strengths are equal , we assume @xmath80 hz .",
    "figure 2 plots the transmission and phase of the transmitted probe field as a function of the probe detuning @xmath81 when the pump field is tuned to the red sideband of the cavity resonance @xmath66 with @xmath67 @xmath68w .",
    "the red solid curve corresponds to the situation where @xmath64 and the blue dashed curve represents the case in the absence of the second mechanical oscillator . in both cases , it can be seen from fig .",
    "2(a ) that a single transparency window appears when the beat frequency @xmath82 is nearly resonant with the frequency of the mechanical oscillator , which is due to the destructive interference between the probe field and the generated anti - stokes field .",
    "such a phenomenon , usually termed as optomechanically induced transparency ( omit ) or electromechanically induced transparency ( emit ) , has been well understood in the generic optomechanical systems where a mechanical resonator is coupled to a electromagnetic cavity @xcite . the concomitant phase dispersion in fig .",
    "2(b ) indicates that this effect can be used to slow and advance electromagnetic fields in mechanical degrees of freedom @xcite .     when the resonance frequencies of the two mechanical oscillators are different .",
    "the insets are the enlarged images in the middle of the figure .",
    "the pump field is red tuned by an amount of @xmath5 with @xmath83 @xmath68w .",

    "the reason is that the width of the transmission window is given by the modified mechanical damping rate @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , where @xmath86 denotes the optomechanical cooperativity @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we mainly consider the case in which the frequencies of the two mechanical oscillators are different but their damping rates are equal , which is the real situation in the experiment of ref .",
    "when the pump field is red tuned by an amount @xmath5 with @xmath87w and the probe field is then scanned through the cavity resonance , in fig .",
    "3 we plot the magnitude and phase of the probe transmission as a function of the probe detuning @xmath81 .",
    "different from fig .",
    "2 , there are two transmission peaks in the probe transmission spectrum , which displays that the input probe field could be simultaneously transparent at two symmetric frequencies .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) is the zoom - in view of the two peaks , from which we can judge that the two peaks locate at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "an intuitive physical picture explaining the bichromatic emit can be given in the energy level diagram shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where @xmath90 represents the number of the intracavity photon , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote the phonon numbers in the two mechanical oscillators with resonance frequencies @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the pump field is red tuned by an amount @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 , and the probe filed of frequency @xmath97 scans through the cavity resonance .",
    "the simultaneous presence of pump and probe fields induces a modulation at the beat frequency @xmath82 of the radiation pressure force acting on the mechanical oscillators .     with @xmath98 for @xmath99 1 , 1.5 @xmath68w , respectively .",
    "the inset plots the width of the transparency window at @xmath88 as a function of the pump power .",
    "other parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "3.,width=302 ]    when this modulation is close to the mechanical resonance frequency @xmath100 , the vibrational mode is excited coherently , giving rise to stokes ( @xmath101 ) and anti - stokes scattering ( @xmath102 ) of light from the strong pump field .",
    "if @xmath103 , stokes scattering is strongly suppressed because it is highly off - resonant with the microwave cavity and we can assume that only the anti - stokes field builds within the cavity .",
    "however , when @xmath104 , the probe field is nearly resonant with the cavity , which is degenerate with the generated anti - stokes fields . as a consequence , destructive interference between these two fields can suppress the build - up of an intracavity probe field and lead to two transparency windows in the probe transmission spectrum at @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "3(b ) shows that the phase of the probe transmission suffers a steep positive dispersion within the two transparency windows , which could be used as a tunable delay for microwave signals .",
    "moreover , the width of the two transparency windows is given by @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "the intracavity photon number @xmath90 can be greatly increased by enhancing the pump power @xmath107 according to eq .",
    "( 12 ) , which will result in broadening of the transparency windows , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . from this figure",
    ", one can see that the transparency window is fully controllable via the applied microwave field , the window expanding and contracting with the power of the pump field .",

    "4 shows a linear relationship between the pump power and the width of the window locating at @xmath88 .     of the transmitted ( a , c ) and reflected ( b , d ) probe field as a function of the pump power considering the effects of the damping rate of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) are plotted using the experimental parameters .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are plotted assuming that the mechanical damping rate can be reduced .",
    "other parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "3.,width=302 ]    both the two transparency windows and the corresponding phase dispersion shown in fig .",
    "3 can be used for controlling the group delay of the microwave signals . for illustration",
    ", we consider the narrow transparency window and sharp phase dispersion at @xmath88 .",
    "the group delays of the transmitted and reflected probe fields as a function of the pump power are plotted in fig . 5 with @xmath98 and @xmath88 .",
    "solid curve ( a ) and dash curve ( b ) represent , respectively , the group delays of the transmitted and reflected probe filed with the realistic experimental parameter , i.e. , @xmath108 hz .",
    "it can be seen that the group delays of the transmitted probe field are positive but those of the reflected probe field are negative when the power of the pump field is varied , which represent the slowing and advancing of the microwave signals , respectively .",
    "the maximum transmission group delay is @xmath109 ms and the reflection signal advance is @xmath110 ms .",
    "moreover , we consider the effect of the mechanical damping rate on the group delay . in ref .",
    "@xcite , zhou _ et al .",
    "_ has shown analytically that the maximum group delay is inversely proportional to the mechanical damping rate . here",
    ", we assume that @xmath111 hz , as shown in curve ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "one can see that the maximum delays are almost twice the values in curve ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "therefore , the group delay of the microwave signal can be further increased by reducing the mechanical damping rates , which can be as low as several hz @xcite .",
    "compared to the generic circuit electromechanical systems in which an electromagnetic cavity is coupled to a single mechanical oscillator , one advantage of the 3-mode hybrid system we study here is that it allows for more controllability to realize double emit , which can also exist when the cavity - pump detuning @xmath66 or @xmath112 .",
    "the two transparency windows still locate at @xmath88 and @xmath89 . as a result ,",
    "group delay of the probe field at a wider range of frequencies can be effectively tuned with negligible losses by the frequency and power of the pump field .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the tunable slowing and advancing of microwave signals based on double emit in a 3-mode circuit electromechanical system . when the frequencies of the two mechanical oscillators are different , two transparency windows appear in the probe transmission spectrum due to destructive interference between the probe field and the anti - stokes filed caused by the two distinct mechanical vibrations .",
    "the narrow transparency window and the corresponding steep phase dispersion allow for controlling the group delay of the microwave probe field with negligible losses , which can be tuned by the power of the pump field .",
    "our theoretical results show that the maximum group delay of the transmitted probe field is @xmath113 ms , and the signal advance of the reflected probe field is about 0.27 ms for the experimental parameters in ref . @xcite .",
