    "the observation of periodic variations in the radial velocities of nearby late - type stars has led to the discovery of @xmath1150 giant planets ( marcy , cochran , & mayor 2000 ) , including 14 multiple planet systems , suggesting that planetary systems may exist around @xmath45% of solar - like main sequence stars .",
    "giant planets , like jupiter , are believed to form in proto - planetary disks made of gas and dust .",
    "as grains grow into larger bodies , the bulk of circumstellar gas dissipates from the system ( e.g. , via accretion onto the star or planetary objects ) until the disk contains predominately large bodies , such as planets and/or planetesimals and dusty debris . studying the dynamics of dust and gas in disks around main sequence stars reveals the presence of planets and small bodies , analogous to asteroids and comets in our solar system .",
    "therefore , studying debris disks may allow us to determine the processes that shape the final architectures of planetary systems including our own solar system .",
    "the lifetimes of dust grains in debris disks are believed to be significantly shorter than the ages of the systems , suggesting that the particles are replenished from a reservoir such as collisions between parent bodies .",

    "the clumping of these asteroids is widely attributed to the break up of larger parent bodies ( chapman et al .",
    "_ iras _ observations of the zodiacal dust discovered the @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath10 dust bands which have orbital properties identical to the themis , koronis , and eos families , suggesting that the dust in each band was created by collisions between asteroids in each family .",
    "non - equilibrium processes may be responsible for the generation of dust bands .",
    "gravitational perturbations by jupiter and other planets in our solar system are expected to cause the apsides and nodes of asteroid orbits to precess at different rates because of small differences in their orbital parameters .",
    "this precession leads to asteroid collisions that generate the small grains observed in the dust bands .",
    "observed debris disks typically possess luminosities 3 - 5 orders of magnitude higher than our zodiacal disk , suggesting that they are significantly more massive .",
    "the dust in these systems may be produced in steady state at earlier times when the planetesimal belt was more massive or during an epoch of intense collisions that produced especially large quantities of dust , triggered by the formation and/or migration of planets .",
    "simulations of planetesimal disks , in which planets are forming from pairwise collisions , suggest that formation of massive planets may trigger collisional cascades between the remaining nearby planetesimals ( kenyon & bromley 2004 ) .",
    "alternately , the migration of giant planets , soon after their formation , may also trigger collisions . in our solar system , the moon and terrestrial planets experienced an intense period of cratering 3.85 gyr ago known as the period of late heavy bombardment .",
    "two pieces of evidence suggest that the impactors during this period may have been asteroids .",

    "scattering of bodies by a planet on an eccentric orbit ( levison , duncan , & wetherill 1994 ) and bodies in mean motion resonances with an eccentric planet , whose orbits decay via secular resonant perturbations by the planet ( beust & morbidelli 1996 ) , have been used to explain the preferentially red - shifted features ; however , both models have difficulties .",
    "the @xmath3 pictoris disk also possesses a stable component of gas at the velocity of the star .",

    "one possible explanation for the low velocity of the atomic gas is that the gas is ionic and that coulomb interactions between ions reduce the effective radiation pressure on the bulk gas .",
