    "the interest in topological properties of physical systems has increased following the discovery of topological insulators@xcite and superconductors.@xcite these new phases of matter have garnered much attention for their exotic physical properties and prospective use in classical and quantum computation.@xcite in particular , one - dimensional topological superconductors host majorana fermions ( mfs ) at their boundaries with nontopological systems which may be used in nearly decoherence - free manipulation of quantum bits.@xcite    recent theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite efforts have been made to engineer such mfs by placing magnetic adatoms on the surface of a superconductor . when the magnetic exchange between an adatom and the quasiparticles in the bulk superconductor is sufficiently strong , a local shiba state@xcite with energy inside the superconducting gap is formed .",
    "a chain of such adatoms creates many shiba states that can hybridize and form a band , which can itself support zero energy mfs at the ends of the chain.@xcite alternatively , when the magnetic exchange energy is small compared to the inter - adatom coupling , a one - dimensional band with helical magnetic order , via the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction,@xcite is formed in the adatom chain itself that , analogous to a one - dimensional quantum wire with proximity - induced superconductivity,@xcite can form mfs at the ends of the chain.@xcite    it is known that magnetic impurities within superconductors cause a local decrease in the superconducting order parameter.@xcite when the exchange energy is of the order the fermi energy , the pairing potential can be reduced to zero and even reverse sign,@xcite forming a local @xmath1-junction . away from the impurity ,",
    "the superconducting gap returns to the bulk value described by a power - law dependence with the lengthscale set by the fermi wavelength .",

    "conversely , when the interatomic electron hopping is larger than the magnetic exchange energy , the system can support three phases : in addition to the known trivial phase with no mfs and the topological phase supporting a single pair of mfs,@xcite for a sufficiently large amplitude in the inhomogeneity of the order parameter , two pairs of mfs can be realized with two ( orthogonal ) mfs on the left end of the system and two on the right end .     and magnetic dipole moment @xmath2 on top of a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor with bulk gap @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the distance between adjacent impurities .",
