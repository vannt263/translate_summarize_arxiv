    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so far such an improvement is only known for some particular surfaces , e.g. k3 surfaces or del pezzo surfaces , which easily follows from riemann - roch theorem and serre duality ( cf .",
    "lemma  [ strong : k3 ] , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  a ) ) . in the 3-fold case",
    ", such an improvement is only known for rank two stable sheaves on @xmath6 by hartshorne  @xcite . in a case of other 3-fold ,",
    "even a conjectural improvement is not known .",
    "the purpose of this note is to propose a conjectural improvement of bg inequality for stable sheaves on quintic 3-folds , motivated by an idea from mirror symmetry and matrix factorizations .",
    "we first state the resulting conjecture :    [ intro : strong ] let @xmath7 be a smooth quintic 3-fold and @xmath8 .",
    "then for any torsion free @xmath1-slope stable sheaf on @xmath0 with @xmath9 , we have the following inequality : @xmath10    the rhs of ( [ intro : bound ] ) is a certain irrational real number contained in @xmath11 , and the detail will be discussed in conjecture  [ strong ] .",
    "our conjecture is derived from an attempt to construct a bridgeland stability condition on @xmath12 corresponding to the gepner point in the stringy khler moduli space of @xmath0 .",
    "the rhs of ( [ intro : bound ] ) is related to the coefficient of the corresponding central charge .",
    "it seems that conjecture  [ intro : strong ] does not appear in literatures even in the rank two case , which we will give a proof in this note :    conjecture  [ intro : strong ] is true if @xmath13 .    the above result will be proved in subsection  [ rank : two ] .",
    "based on a similar idea , we also propose a conjectural clifford type bound for stable coherent systems on quintic surfaces ( cf .  section  [ sec : cli ] ) .",
    "below we discuss background of the derivation of the above conjecture .",
    "the notion of stability conditions on triangulated categories introduced by bridgeland  @xcite has turned out to be an important mathematical object to study .",
    "however it has been a problem for more than ten years to construct bridgeland stability conditions on the derived categories of coherent sheaves on quintic 3-folds . from a picture of the mirror symmetry",
    ", the space of stability conditions on a quintic 3-fold is expected to be related to its stringy khler moduli space , which is described in figure  [ fig : one ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we see three special points , large volume limit , conifold point and gepner point .",
    "a conjectural construction of a bridgeland stability condition near the large volume limit was proposed by bayer , macri and the author  @xcite , and we reduced the problem to showing a bg type inequality evaluating @xmath14 for certain two term complexes . the main conjecture in  @xcite is not yet proved except in the @xmath6 case  @xcite , and we face our lack of knowledge on the set of chern characters of stable objects .    in this note , we focus on the gepner point .",
    "a corresponding stability condition is presumably constructed as a gepner type stability condition  @xcite with respect to the pair @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the seidel - thomas twist  @xcite associated to @xmath17 .",
    "combined with orlov s result  @xcite , as discussed in  @xcite , such a stability condition is expected to give a natural stability condition on graded matrix factorizations of the defining polynomial of the quintic 3-fold .",
    "one may expect that constructing a gepner point also requires such a conjectural inequality .",
    "it seems worth formulating a conjectural bg type inequality which arises in an attempt to construct a gepner point , so that making it clear what we should know on chern characters of stable sheaves .",
    "our conjecture  [ intro : strong ] is the resulting output .",
    "the inequality ( [ intro : bound ] ) itself is interesting since there have been several attempts to improve the classical bg inequality .",
    "assuming conjecture  [ intro : bound ] , we construct data which presumably give a bridgeland stability condition corresponding to the gepner point .",
    "compared to the lower degree cases studied in  @xcite , constructing gepner type stability conditions is much harder in quintic cases , and most of the attempts are still conjectural .",
    "this is the reason we have separated the arguments for the quintic case from the previous paper  @xcite .",
    "we hope that the arguments in this note lead to future developments of the study of chern characters of stable objects on 3-folds .",
