    "entangled states are at the heart of most quantum paradoxes and provide the main tool for quantum information processing , including applications such as teleportation , cryptography , superdense coding , etc .",
    "entangled quantum states are also the basis of bell s inequality violations , which ruled out classical hidden - variable theories in favor of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "bell s inequalities were originally derived for two particles , as a consequence of locality and realism . in almost all experimental demonstrations of these inequalities to date , the same degree of freedom of two particles has been used , e.g. the spin of a photon . very recently , however , the case of so - called `` hybrid entanglement '' , occurring when the involved degrees of freedom of the two particles are not the same , has attracted a certain interest , and the first experimental demonstrations with spin and spatial - mode degrees of freedom have been reported @xcite . using different degrees of freedom also opens up another opportunity , i.e. that of realizing entanglement between different degrees of freedom of a single particle . in this case , no role is played by non - locality , but bell - type inequalities can still be formulated by assuming realism and the so - called `` non - contextuality '' of the two involved commuting observables , i.e. the assumption that the result of a particular measurement of one observable is determined independently of any simultaneous measurement of the other one  @xcite .",
    "non - contextual hidden variable models have been excluded by recent experiments where the violation of suitable inequalities was observed using neutrons  @xcite , ions @xcite , and single photons prepared in entangled spin - path states  @xcite . finally ,",
    "single - particle entanglement , in the case of bosons such as photons , has a classical analog that is obtained by replacing single - photon states with multi - photon coherent states realized within the same field mode @xcite .",
    "such a classical analog helps visualizing the nature of the single - particle entanglement .    a particularly convenient framework in which to explore these concepts is provided by photons carrying both spin angular momentum ( sam ) and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "while the former is the most widely employed internal degree of freedom of photons for quantum manipulations , the latter is becoming an interesting additional resource for quantum applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we study three conceptually related experimental situations .",
    "firstly , heralded single photons are prepared in a state where sam and oam are entangled ( as proposed in @xcite ) , and are then used for testing the contextuality of different degrees of freedom of the same particle .",
    "secondly , correlated photon pairs , where the sam of one photon is entangled with the oam of the other , i.e. photon pairs exhibiting sam - oam hybrid entanglement , are generated and used for testing the contextuality and non - locality of these degrees of freedom when they are spatially separated .",
    "finally , optical coherent states involving many photons , are used to demonstrate a classical analog of sam - oam hybrid entanglement .",
    "the experimental layout we used in the quantum regime ( the first two experiments ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "our down - conversion source generates photon pairs that are entangled in the oam degree of freedom @xcite , each photon being horizontally polarized , as described by @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the signal and idler photons traveling along the two corresponding arms of the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] and @xmath4 , @xmath5 denote sam and oam degrees of freedom , respectively . the integer @xmath6 is the photon oam in units of @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes horizontal linear polarization .      .",
    "in this case we use photon @xmath3 to herald a single photon @xmath2 which we convert into an oam - sam maximally entangled state . starting from state @xmath9 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spdc_state ] ) , we post - select photon pairs having @xmath10 , i.e. in state @xmath11 , by coupling photon @xmath3 into a single - mode optical fiber .",
    "photon @xmath2 is thus also projected into @xmath10 .",
    "spatial light modulator slm b in this case is patterned as a uniform grating , deflecting the beam but not affecting its transverse spatial mode ( see upper - right inset of fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "photon @xmath2 is sent first through a @xmath0-plate @xcite so as to generate the maximally entangled sam - oam state  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 denote left - circular and right - circular polarization states , respectively .",
    "the polarization state of photon @xmath2 emerging from the @xmath0-plate is then measured by a half - wave plate ( hwp ) oriented at a variable angle @xmath15 and a fixed linear polarizer , restoring the horizontal polarization . this hwp - polarizer combination filters incoming photons having linear polarization at angle @xmath16 with respect to the horizontal direction .",
    "in the circular polarization basis , the state of the filtered photons is written as @xmath17 .",
    "the sam measurement does not affect the oam degree of freedom .",
    "non - contextuality can be assumed between the @xmath18-component of photon sam and oam , because , in the paraxial approximation , the sam operator @xmath19 commutes with the oam operator @xmath20 .",
    "after sam filtering , the photon s oam is also measured by a suitable computer - generated hologram , displayed on slm a , followed by coupling into a single - mode fiber .",
    "the hologram pattern is defined by the four - sector alternated @xmath4-shift phase structure shown in the upper - right inset of fig .",
    "[ setup ] , with the four sectors rotated at a variable angle @xmath21 ( the grating fringes are not rotated ) .",
    "on diffraction , this hologram transforms the photons arriving in the oam superposition state @xmath22 back into the @xmath10 state , which is then filtered by coupling in fiber .",
    "the oam superposition state @xmath23 is the spatial mode analog of the linear polarization , and we may refer to its angle @xmath21 as to its `` orientation '' @xcite .",
    "the overall effect of our apparatus is therefore to perform a joint measurement of the polarization and spatial mode orientations of @xmath2 photons at angles @xmath16 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
