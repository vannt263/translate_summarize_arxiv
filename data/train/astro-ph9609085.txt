    "subluminous b stars ( sdb ) form the extreme blue end ( @xmath0@xmath2  20000 k and @xmath3@xmath2  5 ) of the horizontal branch ( heber et al . , @xcite ) and are therefore termed extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars .",
    "such objects are now believed to be the dominant source of uv radiation causing the uv upturn phenomenon in elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges ( dorman et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "while there are more than a thousand sdbs known in the field of our galaxy ( kilkenny et al . , 1988 ) , only in one globular cluster bona - fide sdb stars were shown to exist ( ngc 6752 , heber et al . , @xcite , moehler et al . , @xcite )",
    "several claims that sdb stars had been found in other globular clusters too could not be confirmed by spectroscopic analyses .",
    "moehler et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , de boer et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper i , iii , and ii respectively ) found that all `` classical '' bhb stars ( i.e. stars with @xmath0  @xmath4 20000  k and @xmath3  @xmath4",
    "5 ) in several clusters exhibited too low masses compared to standard evolutionary theory , whereas the sdb stars masses in ngc  6752 were in good agreement with the canonical mass of 0.5 .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to find and analyse sdb stars in other globular clusters . in this letter",
    "we present follow - up spectroscopy and spectral analyses of faint blue stars ( 19@xmath4 v @xmath4 20and @xmath4 ( b@xmath5v )",
    "@xmath4 ) in the globular cluster m15 , which were discovered recently by durrell & harris ( @xcite ) .",
    "two of the four candidates ( f2 - 1 and f2 - 3 ) could not be observed reliably from the ground due to nearby red neighbours ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the remaining candidate stars were observed with the focal reducer of the 3.5 m telescope at the calar alto observatory using grism # 3 ( 134   / mm ) and a slit width of 15 , resulting in medium resolution spectra covering the wavelength range 3250 - 6350   .",
    "we also obtained low resolution spectrophotometric data , using a slit width of 5  and binning the spectra by a factor of 2 along the dispersion axis .",
    ".positions and magnitudes of the sdb candidates and their close neighbours [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     since there is no built - in wavelength calibration lamp we observed wavelength calibration spectra only at the beginning of the night .",
    "the observation and calibration of bias , dark current and flat - field was performed as described in paper i and iii . as the focal reducer produces rather strong distortions we extracted that part of each observation that contained the desired spectrum and some sky and straightened it , using a program written by dr .",
    "o. stahl ( priv",
    ". comm . ) .",
    "we applied the same procedure to the wavelength calibration frames .",
    "thereby we could perform a good two - dimensional wavelength calibration ( using the midas long context ) and sky - subtraction ( as described in paper i ) .",
    "correction of atmospheric and interstellar extinction as well as flux calibration was again performed as described in paper i using the flux tables of massey ( @xcite ) for bd+28@xmath64211 .",
    "the spectra show broad balmer lines and a weak he  i line at 4471  typical for sdb stars .",
    "the low resolution data unfortunately showed some excess flux towards the red , probably caused by a red star ( v = , b@xmath5v = ) 3  away .",
    "fitting only the balmer jump and the b and v photometry of durrell & harris ( 1993 ) we get an effective temperature of 24000  k ( cf .",
    "paper iii ) .",
    "we used the helium- and metal - poor model atmospheres of heber ( cf .",
    "paper iii ) to analyse the medium resolution spectrum of f1 - 1 . as",
    "the resolution of the spectrum varies with wavelength we convolved the model atmospheres with different gaussian profiles for the three balmer lines .",
    "the appropriate fwhm were determined from the calibration lines close to the position of the balmer lines .",
    "we used fwhm of 8.7   for h@xmath7 , 7.1   for h@xmath8 , and 9.8   for h@xmath9 .",
    "we fitted each line separately and derived the mean surface gravity by calculating the weighted mean of the individual results .",
    "the weights were derived from the fit residuals of the individual lines .",
    "we thus get a log g value of 5.2@xmath100.14 for a fixed effective temperature of 24000  k. the fits to the balmer lines are shown in fig .",
    "1 . note in passing that higher temperature and gravity results if we ignore the balmer jump and derive @xmath0  and @xmath3  simultaneously from the three balmer line profiles alone : the smallest overall residual is achieved for @xmath0  = 29700  k and @xmath3  = 5.9 .",
    "these values , however , are inconsistent with the low resolution data .",
    "we already noted similar inconsistencies between balmer jump and balmer line profiles in paper i , which are probably caused by insufficient s / n in the balmer line profiles .",
    "the 4471    line is consistent with a helium abundance of about 0.1 solar . using the routines of r. saffer ( saffer et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) and a fixed mean fwhm of 8    we get internal errors of 600 k and 0.13 dex , respectively . we take the standard deviation of @xmath3as external errors and assume an external error of @xmath0  of @xmath10 2000  k ( cf .",
    "paper  iii ) . using the same method as in papers i and iii we get a logarithmic mass of @xmath50.423@xmath100.20 dex , corresponding to ( 0.38@xmath11 )  . for a detailed discussion of the errors entering into the mass determination see paper  iii .",
    "unlike f1 - 1 and other sdbs the spectrum of f2 - 2 is not dominated by balmer lines but displays a prominent absorption line spectrum in addition to the balmer lines ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the balmer lines are much weaker and narrower than in f1 - 1 . in fig .",
    "2 we compare the spectrum of f2 - 2 ( smoothed by a box filter of 5   width ) to that of a he - sdb in the field ( hs0315 + 3355 , heber et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a spectral type that describes rare helium - rich variants of the sdb stars ( moehler et al . , @xcite , see also below ) , the helium line spectra of both stars are very similar , while the balmer lines in hs0315 + 3355 are considerably weaker than in f2 - 2 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating an even lower hydrogen content of the former .",
    "the admittedly rather low s / n unfortunately allows only a coarse analysis . since an analysis of individual spectral lines is impossible we choose to fit the entire useful portion of the spectrum ( 4000  ",
    "5000 ) simultaneously .",
    "it turned out that f2 - 2 is somewhat hotter than f1 - 1 and we therefore used the updated grid of nlte model atmospheres calculated by s. dreizler ( see dreizler et al .",
    "the model atmospheres include detailed h and he model atoms and the blanketing effects of their spectral lines but no metals . using saffer s fitting program @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and helium abundance were determined simultaneously from a small subgrid ( @xmath0  = 35 , 40 , 45kk ; @xmath3  = 5.5 , 6.0 , 6.5 ; he/(h+he )  =  0.5 , 0.75 , 0.91 , 0.99 , by number ) .    since the 4144  line",
    "is not included in the models , this line is excluded from the fit .",
    "an effective temperature of 36000  k , @xmath3  of 5.9 , and a helium abundance of n@xmath12/(n@xmath13+n@xmath12 )  =  0.87 ( by number ) resulted .",
    "the fit to the spectrum is displayed in fig .",
    "since the noise level is rather high it is difficult to estimate the error ranges of the atmospheric parameters . as a test we changed the fitted spectral range as well as the placement of the continuum , which resulted in quite small changes of @xmath0  ( @xmath14 2000k ) and @xmath3  ( @xmath14 0.2  dex ) .",
    "the helium abundance n@xmath12/(n@xmath13+n@xmath12 ) ranged from 0.5 to 0.9 by number , indicating that helium is overabundant by at least a factor 5 with respect to the sun .",
    "as conservative error estimates we adopted @xmath10 4000  k and 0.5 dex for the errors in @xmath0  and @xmath3 .      for f1 - 1",
    "we derive a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath5142  km / sec from the balmer lines with an estimated error of about @xmath1040  km / sec ( due to the mediocre resolution , the limited accuracy of the wavelength calibration , and the shallow lines ) .",
    "this value is within the error limits consistent with the cluster velocity of -107.09 km / sec ( peterson et al . , @xcite ) . for f2 - 2 we could not derive reliable radial velocities from single lines due to the low s / n of the spectrum . instead we cross correlated the normalized spectrum with that of the field he - sdb hs0315 + 3355 ( convolved to the same resolution ) .",
    "this procedure resulted in a heliocentric velocity of @xmath1570  km / sec , which - due to the large errors - does not contradict a cluster membership for f2 - 2 .",
    "the spectroscopic analyses of two faint blue stars in the globular cluster m15 show that both stars are bona - fide subdwarf b stars . in fig .",
    "4 and 5 we compare their positions in the ( @xmath0 , logg)- and the ( @xmath0 , m@xmath1)-diagrams to those of ehb stars in ngc6752 ( from paper iii ) as well as to the predictions from horizontal branch stellar models ( from dorman et al .",
    "as can be seen from this comparison , their evolutionary status is well described by models for the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) .",
    "hence m15 is only the second globular cluster ( after ngc6752 ) for which the existence of ehb stars has been proven spectroscopically .",
    "while the helium abundance of f1 - 1 is typical for sdb stars ( i.e. subsolar ) , f2 - 2 surprisingly turned out to be a helium rich star .",
    "this is the first time ever that a helium rich sdb star has been reported in a globular cluster . in the field of the milky way only 5% of the sdb stars",
    "are helium - rich .",
    "jeffery et al . (",
    "@xcite ) list 48 such stars , while the latest ( unpublished ) version of the catalog of hot subdwarfs ( kilkenny et al . , @xcite ) lists more than 1,000 hydrogen - rich sdbs .",
    "the helium - rich sdb has an absolute visual brightness of about , which places it at the very faint blue end of the ehb as seen in the colour - magnitude diagram of ngc 6752",
    ". f2 - 2 may even be hotter than any ehb star in ngc6752 . from its proximity to the helium main sequence in fig.4 and 5 it might be tempting to regard f2 - 2 as a naked helium core , i.e. as an extreme horizontal branch star which lost ( almost ) all of its hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "why did nt we find any helium - rich sdbs in ngc6752 ?",
    "all the ehb stars that have been analysed in ngc 6752 ( including the three faintest ones seen in buonanno et al . , @xcite ) are helium - poor sdb stars ( paper iii ) .",
    "this could either mean that there are no helium - rich subdwarfs in ngc  6752 or that they are just below the detection limit of buonanno et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "one should certainly keep an eye on newer and deeper cmds of globular clusters to see whether other he - sdb candidates show up .",

    "s. dreizler for making available his nlte model grid to us and the staff of the calar alto observatory for their support during the observations .",
