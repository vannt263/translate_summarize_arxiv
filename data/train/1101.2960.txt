    "the physical parameters of astrophysical jets are impossible to reproduce in any earth s laboratory .",
    "we therefore must limit ourselves to identify those parameters that are the crucial ones in controlling the overall jet behavior and to rescale the laboratory simulations accordingly . among the many parameters that describe the jet evolution and propagation features , two of them are paramount : the mach number and the jet to ambient density ratio @xcite .",
    "we have therefore devised an experiment where these two parameters can be set to match the ones derived from observations of yso jets @xcite .    in order to better understand the dynamical details of the jet propagation and evolution , we have carried out 3d numerical hydrodynamic simulations adopting boundary and injection conditions that were as close as possible to the experimental ones .",
    "the numerical results show good agreement with the laboratory data , namely : the jet head velocity is consistent for the two situations , the presence of bright knots along the jet is correctly reproduced , and non - axisymmetric perturbations , seen in the heavy jet case , rise and grow in the simulation to resemble the laboratory jet .",
    "observations show that stellar jets extend in space for very long distances , in fact they can reach lengths of hundreds , even thousands , jet radii . while the initial collimation , at the launching region , is likely to be magnetic , however at very large distances from the origin stellar jets maintain their small free - jet opening angle , consistently with a mach number ranging between 10 and 40 . here",
    "we show that laboratory hydro hypersonic jets maintain their structure , at least up to 70 jet radii .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section 2 and 3 we present the apparatus setup and the numerical code , section 4 is dedicated to the comparison of experimental and numerical results , and the conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the jets under study are created inside a modular vacuum vessel , with a maximum length of 5 m and a diameter of 0.5 m .",
    "several kinds of nozzles can be mounted on this vessel .",
    "the vessel diameter is much larger than the diameter of the jets , so that the lateral walls effects are limited .",
    "the required ambient inside the vessel is obtained by means of a system of valves which sets the desired ambient density ( at pressures in the 1.5 to 100 pa range ) using a gas in general different from the jet gas . an electron gun operating at very low pressures , thanks to a set of secondary pumps , and equipped with a deflection system , creates an electron sheet .",
    "this sheet intercepts the jet under test , and generates a plane fluorescent section of the flow .",
    "these fluorescent zones can be acquired by different kinds of cameras , including intensified devices , depending on the experiment to be performed .",
    "the cameras and the electron gun can be mounted on different ports .",
    "the vessel including all the available sections is shown in fig .",

    "the nozzle used in this experiment has been carefully designed to perform nearly isoentropical gas accelerations and expansions , i.e. flows as close as possible to the ideal conditions , but accounting for friction and heat exchange effects .",
    "the nozzles were built at the cern workshop of geneva with surface accuracies in the order of 1@xmath1 m . under such conditions ,",
    "the flow at the nozzle outlet has the design mach number over a very wide cross - section , excluding a thin boundary layer region at the walls , provided that the stagnation - to - ambient pressure ratio @xmath2 maintained between inlet and outlet has a well defined value . in this experiment ,",
    "the stagnation - to - ambient pressure ratio @xmath2 is checked by means of high accuracy pressure transducers .",
    "the mach number is then obtained by a numerical method that takes into account the effects of the boundary layer and heat exchange with the nozzle walls .",

    "the available gases are helium , argon , xenon and air , only the first three ones are used for the jet since the nozzle is designed for monoatomic gases .",
    "the jets meet the electron sheet under the optical window , and the resulting images are acquired by an intensified cmos camera ; besides visualizations , density and structure velocities measurements are possible by image - processing .",
    "the physical time scale of jets @xmath8 can be defined as the ratio between the jet radius at the nozzle exit @xmath9 and the speed of sound internal to the jet under nominal conditions , i.e. when the nozzle works under ideal steady conditions , and is in the order of 0.1 to few ms . in the following",
    ", we will express time in units of @xmath8 and lengths in units of @xmath9 .",
    "the piston - nozzle system is shown in fig .",
    "the jet gas is compressed in a chamber that leads to the nozzle inlet . at the end of the compression run , owing to the valves opening , the outflow increases to a maximum value , then it diminishes as the gas contained in the chamber is used up .",
