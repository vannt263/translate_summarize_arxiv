    "this connection has motivated an extensive use of the 2pcf to analyse galaxy catalogs , the cosmic microwave background anisotropy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and the references therein ) , and the cosmic shear field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the 3pcf is zero for a gaussian field , but during the time evolution of the density perturbations the distribution develops non - gaussian properties .",
    "these can be measured by the 3pcf , or equivalently its fourier - transformed counterpart , the bispectrum , and thus additional information on the nature of gravity and dark matter is gained , including an additional test of the structure formation models .",

    "this form is valid for scales @xmath11 ( p80 ) .",
    "subsequently the analysis of several galaxy catalogs has supported this result .",
    "the eso - uppsala catalog of galaxies @xcite was analysed by @xcite .",
    "the 3pcf was also examined for the cfa , aat and koss redshift samples of galaxies @xcite .",
    "these earlier redshift samples are too small , with @xmath12 galaxies , to allow a test of the hierarchical form in redshift space",
    ". only fits to the hierarchical form were possible .",
    "the @xmath3 value obtained in this way from redshift samples is around @xmath13 @xcite , much smaller than the value extracted by peebles and his coworkers from the lick and zwicky catalogs .",

    "since @xmath17 depends on the shape of the power spectrum in pt2 that can be measured from the galaxy power spectrum on large scales ( assuming a linear bias ) , one may measure the bias parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the 3pcf of galaxies on large scales .    the hierarchical form ( eq .  [ hier ] )",
    "is purely empirical without a solid theoretical argument supporting it .",
    "in contrast , the pt2 theory predicts that @xmath17 of dark matter depends on the shape of triangles on the linear clustering scale .",

    "as demonstrated by jb98 , the projected 3pcf they proposed has simple relations to the real space 3pcf .",
    "their results have revealed that both in redshift space and in real space there are small , but significant deviations from the hierarchical form .",
    "the general dependence of the galaxy 3pcf on triangle shape and size appeared to be in qualitative agreement with the cdm cosmogonic models .",
    "jb98 found that a cdm model with @xmath21 , and an appropriately chosen bias scheme ( the cluster - weighted model originally proposed in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the unavoidable conclusion is that it is difficult to find a simple model which meets all the constraints .    in recent years",
    ", several authors have measured the 3pcf and the bispectrum , with emphasis on the quasilinear and linear clustering scales .",
    "for example , for the apm galaxies @xcite , the iras galaxies @xcite , and the 2dfgrs galaxies @xcite , the measurements were used to constrain the linear , and nonlinear bias parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( eq.[deltabias ] ) , by comparison with a model for the 3pcf obtained in pt2 .    for the apm galaxies the pt2 model for the 3pcf agrees well with the apm catalog measurements on large scales @xcite , which implies @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "these results indicate that on large scales , optical galaxies ( both 2dfgrs galaxies and apm galaxies ) are unbiased relative to the underlying mass distribution , while the iras galaxies are an anti - biased tracer .",
    "furthermore the non - linear bias of the iras galaxies is significantly non - zero .",
    "combining these results with our result on the lcrs ( jb98 ) implies that optical galaxies are a biased tracer on small scale , but an unbiased tracer on larger scale .",
    "in this paper , we measure the 3pcf both in redshift and in the projected space for the two degrees fields galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "we are motivated to investigate further the mismatch of the 3pcf found by jb98 between the concordance cdm model and the lcrs survey . because the 2dfgrs covers a much larger volume than the lcrs",

    "this apparent conflict also motivates us to examine the 3pcf more carefully on quasilinear scales which can be explored by the 2dfgrs .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the clustering of galaxies depends on their luminosity . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "galaxies are included in a wide range of luminosity , and it is difficult to determine , whether for some luminosity range galaxies are unbiased relative to the mass distribution on large scales . in this paper , we will attempt to measure the 3pcf for the first time as a function of luminosity .",
    "we believe that these measurements of the 3pcf will provide useful observational constraints on galaxy formation theories .    in section 2 , we will describe the sample selection for the analysis , the selection effects , and the procedure of generating random and mock samples .",
    "the statistical methods of measuring the 3pcfs are presented in section 3 .",
    "the results of the 2dfgrs are given in section 4 , along with a comparison with the results of the lcrs and the predictions of the concordance model for dark matter .",

    "we select data for our analysis from the 100k public release of the 2dfgrs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; hereafter c01 ) .",
    "the survey covers two declination strips , one in the southern galactic pole ( sgp ) and other in the northern galactic pole(ngp ) , and 99 random fields in the southern galactic cap . in this paper , only galaxies in the two strips are considered .",
    "further criteria for the inclusion of galaxies in our analysis are that they are within the redshift range of @xmath32 , have the redshift measurement quality @xmath33 , and are in regions with redshift sampling completeness @xmath34 better than 0.1 ( where @xmath35 is a sky position ) .",
    "the redshift range restriction is imposed so that the clustering statistics are less affected by the galaxies in the local supercluster , and by the sparse sampling at high redshift .",
    "the redshift quality restriction is imposed so that only galaxies with reliable redshifts are used in our analysis .",
    "an additional reason is that the redshift completeness mask provided by the survey team , which is used in our analysis , is constructed for the redshift catalog of @xmath33 .",
    "the last restriction is imposed in order to eliminate galaxies in the fields for which the field redshift completeness @xmath36 is less than 70 percent ( see c01 about the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "these fields are ( or will be ) re - observed , and have not been included in computing the redshift mask map @xmath34 .",
    "finally , there are a total of 69655 galaxies satisfying our selection criteria , 30447 in the ngp strip and 39208 in the sgp strip .",
    "it is well known that the two - point clustering of galaxies depends on the luminosity @xcite , and the luminosity dependence is an important constraint on galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the size of the 2dfgrs to carry out a first study of the luminosity dependence of the three point correlation function .",
    "the galaxies are divided into three classes ; luminous galaxies with absolute magnitude @xmath38 , faint galaxies with @xmath39 , and typical galaxies with luminosity in between , where @xmath40 is the characteristic luminosity of the schechter function in the @xmath41 band @xcite , and @xmath42 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath43 .",
    "we will also do the analysis for galaxies with @xmath44 in order to compare the results with the previous study of the las campanas redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the details of the subsamples studied in this paper are given in table 1 .",
    "for computing the absolute magnitude , we have used the k - correction and luminosity evolution model of ( * ? ? ?",

    "a detailed account for the observational selection effects has been released with the catalog by the survey team ( c01 ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude changes slightly across the survey region due to further magnitude calibrations that were carried out after the target galaxies had been selected for the redshift measurement .",
    "this observational effect is documented in the magnitude limit mask @xmath50 ( c01 ) .",
    "the redshift sampling is far from uniform within the survey region , and this selection effect is given by the redshift completeness mask @xmath51 .",
    "the redshift measurement success rate also depends on the brightness of galaxies , making fainter galaxies more incomplete in the redshift measurement . the @xmath52 mask provided by the survey team",
    "is aimed to account for the brightness - dependent incompleteness .",
    "these observational effects can be corrected in our analysis for the three - point correlation function through properly generating random samples . to construct the random samples , we first select a spatial volume that is sufficiently large to contain the survey sample .",
    "then , we randomly distribute points within the volume , and eliminate the points that are out of the survey boundary . adopting @xmath53 for the magnitude limits of the survey in the direction @xmath54 , we select random points according to the luminosity function of the 2dfgrs and the @xmath55 model for the k - correction and luminosity evolution @xcite , and assign to each point an apparent magnitude ( and an absolute magnitude ) .",
    "this unclustered sample is a random sample for the 2dfgrs photometric catalog .",
    "then we implement the magnitude - dependent redshift selection effect according to c01 .",

    "we have used the corrected value @xmath65 for the @xmath66 parameter in the power - law galaxy count model according to the web page of the 2dfgrs .",
    "we have checked the random samples carefully by reproducing the angular distribution , mean redshift distribution , and especially the two - point statistics of clustering of the observed catalog .",
    "it is known that the two - point correlation function measured from galaxy catalogs on large scale is sensitive to the details of corrections for the above selection effects .",
    "we have estimated the redshift and projected correlation functions by the same method as in jmb98 for the las campanas redshift survey .",
    "the two - point correlation functions are shown in figure [ xis ] and figure [ wrpfig ] , and can be compared with the results of the 2dfgrs team for the clustering of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the broad agreement with their results , even the subtle difference between the north and south caps ( the clustering on large scales is slightly larger in the southern cap than in the northern cap ) , and the luminosity dependence of the clustering , is well reproduced in our analysis .",
    "we did not take into account in our analysis the fiber collision effect that two galaxies closer than @xmath67 arcsec can not be assigned fibers simultaneously in one spectroscopic observation .",
    "thus one of them will not have a redshift observation if no re - observation is arranged .",
    "this effect reduces the real space ( or projected ) two - point correlation function at small separations . with lcrs",
    ", jmb98 estimated the effect to lead to a 15 percent reduction in the two - point correlation function at projected separations @xmath68 and to a less than 5 percent reduction at separations larger than @xmath69 .",
    "this effect is smaller ( 10 percent reduction at separations @xmath70 ) in the 2dfgrs @xcite , because the limiting fiber separation is slightly smaller ( 30 arc sec in the 2dfgrs vs 55 arcsec in the lcrs ) , and one field may be observed more than once in the 2dfgrs observation strategy .",
    "jb98 have examined the fiber collision effect on their measurement of the three - point correlation function of the lcrs .",
    "they found that the effect reduces the real space ( projected ) three - point correlation function at small separation , but changes little the normalized three - point correlations functions @xmath3 that we will measure in this paper , because the effects on the two - point cf and three - point cf are canceled out when @xmath3 is measured .",
    "since the effect is slightly smaller in 2dfgrs in terms of the two - point clustering , we believe that only a negligible effect on our measurement of the normalized three - point correlations would result .",
    "we measure the three - point correlation functions for the galaxies in the 2dfgrs following the method of jb98 . by definition , the joint probability @xmath71 of finding one object simultaneously in each of the three volume elements @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 at positions @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , is as follows ( p80 ) : [ 3pcfdf ] dp_123=d d d where @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the mean density of galaxies at @xmath80 , and @xmath9 is the three - point correlation function .",
    "this definition can be applied straightforwardly to redshift surveys of galaxies to measure the 3pcf @xmath81 of galaxies in redshift space ( at this point we neglect the anisotropy induced by the redshift distortion which will be considered later ) . here and below we use @xmath82 to denote the real space and @xmath83 the redshift space .",
    "the 3pcf of galaxies can be measured from the counts of different triplets ( p80 ) .",
    "four types of distinct triplets with triangles in the range ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 ) are counted : the count @xmath87 of triplets formed by three galaxies ; the count @xmath88 of triplets formed by two galaxies and one random point ; the count @xmath89 of triplets formed by one galaxy and two random points ; the count @xmath90 of triplets formed by three random points .",
    "the random sample of points is generated in the way described in the previous section .",
    "following the definition [ eq([3pcfdf ] ) ] , we shall use the following estimator [ 3pcfred ] & = & 27 rrr^2ddddrr^3 + & & - 9 rrrddrdrr^2 + 2 to measure the 3pcf of the galaxies in redshift space .",
    "the above formula is slightly different from the estimator used by @xcite .",
    "here we have extended the argument of @xcite for the 2pcf to the case of the 3pcf .",
    "the coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath92 are due to the fact that only _",
    "distinct _ triplets are counted in this paper . since the early work of peebles and coworkers ( p80 ) indicates that the 3pcf of galaxies is approximately hierarchical , it is convenient to express the 3pcf in a normalized form @xmath93 : [ qred ] q_red= + +",
    ". it is also convenient to use the variables introduced by peebles ( p80 ) to describe the shape of the triangles formed by the galaxy triplets . for a triangle with the three sides @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath2",
    "are defined as : [ ruv ] s = s_12 , u = s_23 , v = s_31-s_23 .",
    "clearly , @xmath96 and @xmath2 characterize the shape and @xmath95 the size of a triangle .",
    "we take equal logarithmic bins for @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the bin intervals @xmath97 , and equal linear bins for @xmath2 with @xmath98 . for our analysis",
    ", we take the following ranges for @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath2 : @xmath99 ( @xmath100 bins ) ; @xmath101 ( 3 bins ) ; and @xmath102 ( 5 bins ) .    as in jb98 , we have generalized the ordinary linked - list technique of @xmath103 simulations @xcite to spherical coordinates to count the triplets .",
    "the linked - list cells are specified by the spherical coordinates , i.e. the right ascension @xmath66 , the declination @xmath104 and the distance @xmath95 . with this short - range searching technique",
    ", we can avoid the triplets out of the range specified thus making counting triplets very efficient .",
    "because the triplet count @xmath105 is proportional to the third power of the number density of random points , the count within a fixed range of triangles would vary significantly among different luminosity subsamples if the number of random points is fixed , since the volumes covered by different subsamples are very different .",
    "we want to have random samples such that the random counts and the cross counts are as big as possible in order to suppress any uncertainty from the limited number of random points .",
    "therefore , since the cpu time for counting triplets is approximately proportional to the total count of triplets in our linked list method , we choose the number of random points as large as possible for the computations of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , or @xmath107 under the condition that each computation is finished in @xmath108 cpu hours on a pentium iv 2.2 ghz pc .",
    "the number of random points ranges from @xmath109 ( for sample iv ) to @xmath110 ( for sample i ) when computing @xmath105 , and increases to @xmath111 ( for sample i ) when computing @xmath107 .",
    "the counts @xmath105 for small triangles ( @xmath112 ) could still be small , and therefore we have recalculated the counts @xmath105 for @xmath113 by generating a random sample 10 times larger , so as to ensure that the counts @xmath105 are at least @xmath114 for the triangle configurations of interest .",
    "we scaled these counts properly when we determined the three - point correlation function through equation ( [ 3pcfred ] ) . the uncertainty caused by the number of random points",
    "is negligible compared to the sampling errors of the observational sample .",
    "the 3pcf in redshift space @xmath0 depends both on the real space distribution of galaxies and on their peculiar motions .",
    "although this information contained in @xmath0 is also useful for the study of the large scale structures ( see  4 ) , it is apparent that @xmath0 is different from @xmath115 in real space . in analogy with the analysis for the two - point correlation function , we have determined the projected three - point correlation function @xmath116 .",
    "we define the redshift space three - point correlation function @xmath117 through : [ 3pcfzdf ] dp^z_123&= & d d d where @xmath118 is the joint probability of finding one object simultaneously in each of the three volume elements @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 at positions @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 ; @xmath125 is the redshift space two - point correlation function ; @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the separations of objects @xmath128 and @xmath129 perpendicular to and along the line - of - sight respectively .",

    "however , there is a significant difference between the north and south subsamples .",
    "the main reason is that this sample covers only a small cosmic volume , so the sample - to - sample difference ( the cosmic variance ) can be large .",
    "in fact , even the 2pcfs of these subsamples are dramatically different ( see figure [ xis ] ) .",
    "considering the fact that the bootstrap error is not sufficient to fully account for the cosmic variance , one should remain cautious about the result of the faintest sample ( iv ) .",
    "nonetheless , from figures [ qred_1 ] to [ qred_5 ] we conclude that there is at best a slight dependence on luminosity in the sense that the amplitude @xmath0 tends to be smaller for brighter galaxies .",
    "the projected 3pcf in comparison shows a behavior which is somewhat different . in the bright galaxy sample ( figure [ qproj_1 ] )",
    "@xmath4 is about 0.7 at @xmath165 , and it reaches down to @xmath166 at @xmath167 for small @xmath2 , so the dependences on @xmath139 is quite mild .",
    "there is , however , a small but significant increase with @xmath2 .",
    "fainter galaxies show a similar weak dependence on @xmath139 and @xmath2 ( figures [ qproj_2 ] and [ qproj_4 ] ) . but comparing different samples , we find a trend that brighter galaxies have lower values of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 of the fainter samples ( ii and iv ) is about 50% higher than that of the brightest sample of @xmath168 .",
    "we will discuss the implications for the bias parameters in  4.3 .",
    "the figures show that while the values of @xmath4 are similar for the north and south subsamples , the value for the total sample is larger than that of either subsample .",
    "this looks a bit surprising at first glance . but",
    "considering that the 2pcf of the north sample is almost 1.5 times larger than that of the south sample on @xmath169 scales , it is not difficult to explain the behavior of @xmath4 of the total sample and the two subsamples . as an idealized example , we assume that the two subsamples are well separated and have the same sample size , the same @xmath4 , but the 2pcf of one sample is 1.5 times larger than that of the other .",
    "this example is quite close to the real situation of the faintest sample .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the @xmath4 of the total sample is 1.4 times that of the subsamples . with this example",
    ", it is easy to see that the amplitude @xmath4 of the total sample is larger than that of the subsamples for @xmath170 for the faintest galaxies .",
    "this unusual behavior again can be attributed to the fact that this sample surveys only a small volume of sky , so the cosmic variance is large .      in figure [ qred_2df_lcrs ]",
    "we compare the normalized 3pcf in redshift space @xmath0 of the 2dfgrs and las campanas surveys .",
    "the data of the lcrs are taken from jb98 for galaxies with luminosities in the r - band @xmath171 . from the 2dfgrs",
    "we simply take our result for the galaxies with @xmath172 , although we are aware of the fact that the galaxies are selected in different wavebands in the two surveys .",
    "there are subtle differences in the results which we attribute to this choice of the observational bands , because @xmath3 depends on luminosity weakly for @xmath173 . for small values of @xmath174 ,",
    "the 2df catalog gives a slightly higher amplitude than the lcrs galaxies .",
    "this could reflect the fact that the real space 2pcf of the lcrs galaxies is higher than that of the apm galaxies on small scales , as jmb98 pointed out .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0 values agree very well between the two samples , especially on larger scales .",
    "the 2df sample gives rise to a much smaller error , because of its large sample size .    to compare the projected amplitudes @xmath4",
    ", we display this quantity for the two catalogs in figure [ qproj_2df_lcrs ] .",
    "again the agreement is quite satisfactory , especially when we take the larger error bars for the lcrs result into consideration .",
    "however , the systematic decrease with @xmath139 that can be read off for the mean values of @xmath4 for the lcrs data , is not present for the 2dfgrs .",
    "this is probably caused by the fact that the sky area of the lcrs is much smaller than the 2dfgrs survey , so the mean value of the lcrs is systematically underestimated .",
    "the 2dfgrs data also imply that the real space 3pcf of galaxies on the small scales explored here , does not deviate significantly from the hierarchical form ( p80 ) , and that the fitting formula given in jb98 for the projected @xmath4 needs to be revised .    in conclusion ,",
    "our 2dfgrs results of @xmath3 , both in redshift space and in projected space , are in good agreement with the results obtained by jb98 for the lcrs .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the observational results with model predictions .",
    "currently , the parameters of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model have been determined pretty accurately by a combination of data from wmap , 2dfgrs , lyman-@xmath66 absorption systems , and complementarily by many other observations @xcite .",
    "we choose the running power cdm model of spergel et al .",
    "for comparison with our statistical results , for this model matches most available observations : the universe is flat with a density parameter @xmath175 and a cosmological constant @xmath176 .",
    "the hubble constant is @xmath177 and the baryonic density parameter @xmath178 .",
    "the primordial density power spectrum deviates slightly from the zhedovich spectrum as @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "although there is no consensus about the necessity of introducing the running power index @xmath181 , we choose this model as a reasonable approximation to the real situation .    because the three - point correlation functions which we have measured , are in the non - linear and quasilinear regimes , we use a n - body simulation to make model predictions .",
    "the simulation has @xmath182 particles in a cubic box of @xmath183 , and is generated with our @xmath103 code ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the code ) . to include the effect of baryonic matter oscillations on large scale structures , the fitting formula of @xcite for the transfer function",
    "is used to generate the initial condition .",
    "since the median redshift of the 2dfgrs is @xmath184 , we choose the simulation output at this redshift .",
    "we note that the three - point correlation is quite sensitive to the presence of very massive clusters , therefore a large simulation box like the one used here is necessary . with a small box of @xmath185",
    "the three - point correlation function may be underestimated severely .    generally speaking , galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying matter distribution in the universe .",
    "a luminosity dependence of the bias @xcite means that faint and bright galaxies trace the matter distribution differently .",
    "it has become popular in recent years to account for the bias of certain types of galaxies phenomenologically with the so - called halo occupation model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for an updated account of this model ) .",
    "the three - point correlation function of galaxies can also be modeled within this framework ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed account of this modeling ) , though it seems difficult to account for the two - point and three - point correlation functions in the lcrs simultaneously with simple power - law occupation models @xcite . our accurate measurement of the 3pcf for the 2dfgrs and its luminosity - dependence will certainly provide an even more stringent constraint on the halo occupation models .",
    "it remains to be seen , if the sophisticated model of yang et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) can explain the results obtained in this paper .",
    "we want to investigate this issue in a subsequent paper , and here we only compare with one model prediction for the dark matter , in order to set a baseline quantifying the difference in the normalized three point correlation function between real galaxies and dark matter for the concordance cdm model .",
    "the comparison between the 2dfgrs results and the model predictions is displayed in figures [ model_qred_1 ] to [ model_qproj_2 ] .",
    "here we consider only two luminosity subsamples .",
    "first , we find that the qualitative features , such as the dependence on @xmath2 for fixed @xmath95 or @xmath139 , and @xmath96 , the decrease of @xmath3 with increasing values of @xmath95 or @xmath186 are reproduced quite well by the dm simulations . for the luminous sample ( sample i ) ,",
    "the @xmath3 values of the data set are generally lower than the dark matter model predictions , up to a factor @xmath187 . for the less luminous sample ( sample ii ) , the observed @xmath3 values also are smaller than those of the dark matter on small scales , but the observed values and the model predictions agree at the values @xmath188 and @xmath189 . because the largest scales probed here are expected to be linear or quasilinear scales , we expect the linear bias model ( eq.[deltabias ] ) to hold on these scales .",
    "our result therefore tells us that on linear scales , the galaxies of @xmath190 are approximately an unbiased tracer , but the brightest galaxies of @xmath191 have a bias factor @xmath7 .    because the 2pcf of the galaxies of sample ii matches well the 2pcf of the dark matter in the concordance wmap model , and",
    "our 3pcf results show that the galaxies of sample ii are unbiased on large , linear scales , we find support for the density fluctuation normalization @xmath192 obtained by @xcite . on the other hand , our result shows that the three - point correlations @xmath3 of galaxies are lower on non - linear scales than the prediction of the wmap concordance model .",
    "physical models , e.g. the halo occupation number model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the semi - analytical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are needed to interpret the observed small scale non - linear bias .",
    "we will pursue this in a future paper .",
    "the three - point correlation amplitudes of sample iii and sample v are very close to that of sample ii .",
    "the @xmath3 of these samples gradually conforms to the model prediction of the concordance model on quasilinear scales @xmath193 .",
    "our results are therefore consistent with the analysis of verde et al . who showed that the 2dfgrs galaxies ( without a luminosity classification ) are an unbiased tracer of the underlying matter on scales @xmath26 to @xmath194 .",
    "in a detailed analysis of the 3pcf for the 2dfgrs survey we have accurately measured the 3pcf for galaxies of different luminosity .",
    "the 3pcf amplitudes ( @xmath0 or @xmath4 ) of galaxies generally decrease with the increase of the triangle size and increase with the increase of @xmath2 , qualitatively in agreement with the predictions for the dark matter clustering in popular hierarchical cdm models . some dependence on luminosity",
    "is found , but not a strong effect , except for the brightest galaxy sample which seems to have lower amplitudes of up to @xmath195 . comparing with the previous study on the lcrs galaxies ( jb98 )",
    ", we find good agreement between the two studies , though the results from the 2dfgrs are more accurate , since the 2dfgrs survey is much larger than the lcrs survey .",
    "the amplitudes in redshift space @xmath0 are very similar , but the projected ones @xmath4 show some difference .",
    "it seems that the projected 3pcf from the lcrs is systematically underestimated for @xmath139 in the range of a few @xmath169 , because of the thin slice geometry of that survey .",
    "the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath139 is much weaker in the 2dfgrs survey than in the lcrs survey .    comparing the measured 3pcf amplitudes ( @xmath0 or @xmath4 ) to the prediction of a wmap concordance model",
    ", we find that the measured values are consistently lower than the predicted ones for dark matter . as in the case of the lcrs",
    "about one - half of the predicted @xmath3 value provides a good description of @xmath4 for the 2dfgrs data . as in jb98 for the lcrs data",
    ", we may state that the best fit dm model gives higher values for the 3pcf than observed .",
    "this indicates that the simple dm models must be refined , either by using more sophisticated bias models , or a more sophisticated combination of model parameters .",
    "the division of galaxies into luminosity classes reveals that the brightest galaxies are biased even on large scales , while the galaxies of sample ii show a nonlinear bias on small scale , but appear unbiased on linear scales .",
    "the work has made use of the data released by the 2dfgrs team , and the software for generating mock samples provided by peder norberg and shaun cole .",
    "we are grateful to peder norberg for his explanations on how to use the masks and the softwares .",
