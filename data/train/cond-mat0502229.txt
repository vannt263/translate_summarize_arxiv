    "the possibility to vary several parameters at the same frequency but with different phases @xcite of a coherent ( mesoscopic ) system opens up new prospects for the investigation of dynamical quantum transport .",
    "the adiabatic variation of parameters is of particular interest since at small frequencies the conductor stays close to an equilibrium state : the opening of inelastic conduction channels is avoided and quantum mechanical phase coherence is preserved to the fullest extend possible .",
    "the relevant physics has a simple and transparent explanation within the scattering matrix approach .",
    "the variation of parameters leads to a dynamic scattering geometry .",
    "quite generally we consider changes in the scattering geometry as an _ internal _ response @xcite in contrast to the external response generated by voltages applied to the contacts of the conductor , see fig .",
    "in general a linear response consists both of a response to an external potential oscillations , and response to internal potentials . the internal response can be expressed with the help of the emissivity @xmath0 .",
    "the emissivity @xmath0 is the portion of the density of states at @xmath1 of carriers that will exit the conductor through contact @xmath2 .",
    "the emissivity relates the amplitude @xmath3 of the current in lead @xmath2 to the amplitude @xmath4 of a small and slowly oscillating internal potential . at zero temperature",
    "we have @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 is an electron charge and @xmath7 .",
    "the integral in ( [ eq1 ] ) runs over the region in which the potential deviates from its equilibrium value ( typically the volume occupied by the scatterer ) .    ,",
    "say , in the left lead can arise as a response either to an oscillating potential @xmath8 at one of the external reservoirs , or as a response to an oscillating potential profile @xmath9 inside the mesoscopic sample .",
    ", height=151 ]    the emissivity is expressed in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath10 ( of the stationary scatterer ) and its functional derivative with respect to the internal potential variation @xmath11 : @xmath12.\\ ] ] the scattering matrix is evaluated at the fermi energy @xmath13 .",
    "the summation runs over all the leads ( for simplicity here assumed to be single channel ) connecting the sample to external @xmath14 reservoirs .    applying the inverse fourier transformation to ( [ eq1 ] ) gives the current @xmath15 flowing in response to a time - dependent internal potential @xmath16 .",
    "( 1 ) can easily be generalized to find the response to an arbitrary field or parametric variation of the scattering geometry @xcite . to arrive at a general expression we remember that the scattering matrix depends on the internal potential @xmath17 .",
    "that in turn makes @xmath10 time - dependent , @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "thus alternatively we can express eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the form @xmath19    originally in @xcite the potential @xmath16 is the self - consistent coulomb potential .",
    "however the form of ( [ eq3 ] ) tells us that the current @xmath20 can arise in response to a slow variation of any quantity ( parameter ) which affects the scattering properties of a mesoscopic sample .",
    "for instance the current generated by a slowly varying vector potential @xcite permits to derive the landauer dc - conductance from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "but eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) is not limited to the linear response regime .",
    "the current @xmath20 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is a nonlinear functional of the scattering matrix .",
    "therefore , the mesoscopic system can exhibit an internal rectification effect , i.e. , an oscillating internal potential ( or any appropriate oscillating parameter ) can result in a dc current @xmath21 .",
    "since the elements of the scattering matrix are quantum mechanical amplitudes the dc - current is the result of a _ quantum _ rectification process .",
    "this is a quantum pump effect @xcite .",
    "an approach to quantum pumping based on ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) was put forth by brouwer @xcite .    since the time derivative enters ( [ eq3 ] )",
    ", quantum rectification will work only under special conditions @xcite .",
    "let one or several parameters affecting the scattering properties of a mesoscopic sample change adiabatically and periodically in time .",
    "then the scattering matrix changes periodically as well .",
    "consider the point representing the scattering matrix in the space of all scattering matrices . during the completion of one time period this point will move along a closed line @xmath22 .",
    "then the dc current @xmath23 , which is the current @xmath20 averaged over the time period @xmath24 , can be represented as a contour integral in the above mentioned abstract space @xcite : @xmath25    the dc current @xmath26 , is non - zero if and only if the line @xmath22 encloses a non - vanishing area @xmath27 .",
    "the easy way to see this is to consider a two parameter space with parameters being @xmath10 and @xmath28 . since @xmath10 and @xmath29 depend on the same set of parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , ( which includes , for instance , the shape of a sample , the internal potential , the magnetic field , the temperature , the pressure , the fermi energy , etc . ) then to get the cycle with @xmath32 it is necessary to have at least two parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 varying with the same frequency @xmath35 and with a phase lag @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , if the oscillating amplitudes are small , i.e. , if the scattering matrix changes only a little across @xmath27 , then the pumped current is proportional to the square of the cycle area @xcite :",
    "@xmath37 the very simple and compact expression ( 4 ) allows to find the pumped current for a wide range of situations .",
    "illustrative examples can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we will now discuss the pumping process from the point of view of photon - assisted transport through a mesoscopic system .",
    "we will show how the interlay between photon  assisted transport and quantum mechanical interference results in a quantum pump effect @xcite .",
    "by nature , the quantum pump effect is a rectification effect .",
    "a single parameter variation only leads to an ac - current . in a two parameter variation the modulation of the scatterer due to the second parameter rectifies the ac - currents generated by the first parameter .",
    "rectification is only achieved if the driven system can scatter electrons in an asymmetric way . here",
    "the asymmetry means that the probability @xmath38 for an electron to pass through the sample , say , from the lead @xmath39 to the lead @xmath2 and the probability @xmath40 to transit the scatterer in the reverse direction differ , @xmath41 .",
    "then the flux of electrons entering the scatterer through lead @xmath2 and the flux of electrons scattered and leaving the system through the same lead @xmath2 differ from each other , resulting in a net electron flow in lead @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting current can be viewed as a result of an asymmetrical redistribution of incoming flows between the outgoing leads .    to clarify the physical mechanism which can lead to asymmetric scattering",
    "we now emphasize the essential difference between the driven scatterer and a stationary one .",
    "the key difference is the possibility of photon  assisted transport . in the stationary case if an electron with energy @xmath42 enters the phase coherent system then it leaves the system with the same energy @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , in the driven case while traversing the system an electron can absorb ( or emit ) energy quanta @xmath43 and thus it can leave the system with an energy @xmath44 .",
    "it is important that the electron changes its energy interacting with a system which is modulated deterministically . as a consequence",
    "the inelastic processes is coherent .",
    "if there are several possibilities for transmission through the system absorbing or emitting the same energy ( say , @xmath43 ) the corresponding quantum  mechanical amplitudes will interfere .",
    "such an interference of photon  assisted amplitudes can lead to directional asymmetry of electron propagation through a driven mesoscopic sample .    to illustrate this process we consider a simple but generic example .",
    "it is a system consisting of two regions with oscillating potentials @xmath45 and @xmath46 separated by the distance @xmath47 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that both potentials oscillate with the same small amplitude @xmath48 .",
    "consider an electron with energy @xmath42 incident on the system . in leading order in the oscillating",
    "amplitudes only absorption / emission of a single energy quantum @xmath49 needs to be taken into account .",
    "so , there are only three scenarios to traverse the system . in the first case ,",
    "an electron does not change its energy , the outgoing energy is @xmath50 . in the second case",
    ", it absorbs one energy quantum , @xmath51 . in the third case",
    ", it emits an energy @xmath49 , @xmath52 .",
    "since all these processes correspond to different final states ( which differ in energy @xmath53 from each other ) then the full probability @xmath54 to pass through the system is a sum of three contributions : @xmath55 here the first argument is an outgoing electron energy while the second argument is an incoming energy .",
    "the probability @xmath56 , like the tranmission probability of stationary scatterer , is insensitive to the propagation direction .",
    "in contrast @xmath57 and @xmath58 are directionally sensitive .",
    "therefore we concentrate on the last two .",
    "traverses two oscillating potentials @xmath59 and @xmath60 , a distance @xmath47 apart , and absorbs / emits an energy quantum @xmath49 there are two interfering alternatives .",
    "the modulation quantum can be either absorbed / emitted at the first barrier or at the second one .",
    ", height=151 ]    let us consider @xmath57 .",
    "there are two possibilities to pass through the system and to absorb an energy @xmath49 , see , fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "the first possibility is to absorb an energy due to the oscillation of @xmath59 .",
    "the second possibility is to absorb an energy interacting with @xmath60 . in these two processes",
    "an electron has the same initial state and the same final state .",
    "therefore , we can not distinguish between these two possibilities and according to quantum mechanics to calculate the corresponding probability we first have to add up the corresponding amplitudes and only then take the square .",
    "let us denote the amplitude corresponding to the propagation through the system with absorbing @xmath49 at @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "then the corresponding full probability is : @xmath63 each amplitude ( either @xmath64 or @xmath65 is a product of two terms , the amplitude @xmath66 ( here @xmath67 is an electron wave number ) of free propagation in between the potentials and the amplitude @xmath68 describing the absorption of an energy quantum @xmath49 at the potential @xmath61 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath68 is proportional to the corresponding fourier coefficient of @xmath69 .",
    "the proportionality constant is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath70 .    the probability for an electron going from the left to the right is denoted by @xmath71 . the probability corresponding to the reverse direction  by @xmath72 .",
    "our aim is to show that @xmath73    first we consider @xmath71 . scattering from the left to the right an electron first meets the potential @xmath59 and only then the potential @xmath60 . therefore if an electron absorbs the energy @xmath49 at the first potential it traverses the remaining part of the system with enhanced energy @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding amplitude is @xmath75 . while if an electron absorbed @xmath49 at the second potential then it goes through the system with the initial energy @xmath42 .",
    "the quantum mechanical amplitude corresponding to such a process reads : @xmath76 .",
    "if the energy quantum is much smaller then the electron energy , @xmath77 , then we can expand the phase factor corresponding to free propagation with enhanced energy @xmath78 to first order in the driving frequency : @xmath79 , here @xmath80 is an electron velocity .",
    "thus we have : @xmath81 substituting these amplitudes into ( [ eq7 ] ) we obtain the probability to pass through the system from the left to the right with the absorption of an energy quantum @xmath49 : @xmath82 now we consider the probability @xmath72 .",
    "going from the right to the left an electron first meets the potential @xmath60 and then the potential @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding amplitudes are : @xmath83 using ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) we find : @xmath84 comparing ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) we see that the transmission probability depends on the direction of electron propagation as we announced in ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "let us characterize the asymmetry in transmission probability by the difference @xmath85 : @xmath86 in our simple case the emission leads to the same asymmetry in the photon  assisted transmission probability : @xmath87 .",
    "therefore if there are the same electron flows @xmath88 coming from the left and from the right , then a net current @xmath89 is generated .",
    "we assume a positive current to be directed to the right .",
    "we see that the induced current @xmath90 depends separately on @xmath91 and on the factor @xmath92 .",
    "this is an additional dynamical phase due to absorption of an energy quantum @xmath49 .",
    "such a separation of phase factors can be interpreted in the following way .",
    "the presence of the phase lag @xmath93 ( by modulo @xmath94 ) between the oscillating potentials @xmath59 and @xmath60 breaks the time reversal invariance of a problem and hence potentially permits the existence of a steady particle flow .",
    "the second term emphasizes a spatial asymmetry of a model consisting of two inequivalent oscillating regions separated by a distance @xmath47 , and tells us that the interference of photon  assisted amplitudes is the mechanism inducing electron flow .",
    "neither a phase lag nor a photon - assisted process can separately lead to a dc current .",
    "the simple model presented here reproduces several generic properties of a periodically driven quantum system .",
    "first , a driven spatially asymmetric system can pump a current between external electron reservoirs to which this system is coupled .",
    "second , the pumped current is periodic in the phase lag between the driving parameters .",
    "third , at small driving frequency , @xmath95 , the current generated is linear in @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast the oscillatory dependence on @xmath35 of ( [ eq13 ] ) is a special property of the simple resonant tunneling structure @xcite .",
    "in experiments the external electrical circuit to which the pump is connected is important @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is of interest to understand the workings of a quantum pump connected to contacts which are not at equilibrium but support dc - voltages and ac - potentials .",
    "we now present a number of results of a rigorous calculation of dynamically generated currents within the scattering matrix approach for spinless non - interacting particles @xcite .",
    "these results permit the investigation of pumping also in experimentally more realistic non - ideal situations .",
    "we generalize the approach of @xcite to the case of strong periodic driving when many photon processes are of importance . to take them into account we use the floquet scattering matrix whose elements @xmath96 are the quantum mechanical amplitudes ( times @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , @xmath44 ) for scattering of an electron with energy @xmath42 from lead @xmath39 to lead @xmath2 with absorption ( @xmath99 ) or emission ( @xmath100 ) of @xmath101 energy quanta @xmath49 . like in @xcite",
    "we deal with low frequencies ( adiabatic driving ) and calculate the current linear in @xmath35 . in this limit",
    "we can expand the floquet scattering matrix in powers of @xmath35 .",
    "to zero - th order the floquet sub - matrices @xmath102 are merely the matrices of fourier coefficients @xmath103 of the stationary scattering matrix with time - dependent ( pump)-parameters , @xmath104 .",
    "the matrix @xmath105 is the _ frozen _ scattering matrix , in the sense that it describes the time moment @xmath106 and hence stationary scattering . if all the reservoirs are kept at the same conditions ( potential , temperature",
    "the knowledge of only the frozen scattering matrix is sufficient to calculate the current flowing through the scatterer , see ( [ eq3 ] ) . under more general conditions knowledge of the frozen scattering matrix",
    "is not sufficient .",
    "we stress that the frozen scattering matrix does not describe the scattering of electrons by a time - dependent scatterer : only the floquet scattering matrix does .",
    "since we are interesting in a current linear in @xmath35 then , in general , it is necessary to know the floquet scattering matrix with the same accuracy .",
    "thus we have to go beyond the frozen scattering matrix approximation and to take into account the corrections of order @xmath35 . as we illustrated in sec.[simple ] such corrections are due to interference between photon  assisted amplitudes .",
    "we use the following ansatz : @xmath107 the matrix @xmath108 [ with fourier coefficients @xmath109 introduced here is a key ingredient . as we will see this matrix reflects the asymmetry in scattering from one lead to the other and back . the unitarity condition for the floquet scattering matrix leads to the following equation for the matrix @xmath108 : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the poisson bracket with respect to energy and time @xmath112 the matrix @xmath113 can not be expressed in terms of the frozen scattering matrix @xmath105 and it has to be calculated ( like @xmath10 itself ) in each particular case .",
    "nevertheless there are several advantages in using ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "first , the matrix @xmath113 has a much smaller number of elements than the floquet scattering matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath113 depends on only one energy , @xmath42 , and , therefore , it has @xmath114 elements like the stationary scattering matrix @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the floquet scattering matrix @xmath115 depends on two energies , @xmath42 and @xmath116 , and , therefore , it has @xmath117 relevant elements . here",
    "@xmath118 is the maximum number of energy quanta @xmath49 absorbed / emitted by an electron interacting with the scatterer which we have to take into account to correctly describe the scattering process . for small amplitude",
    "driving we have @xmath119 , whereas if the parameters vary with a large amplitude then @xmath120 .",
    "second , the floquet scattering matrix has no definite symmetry with respect to a magnetic field @xmath121 reversal .",
    "in contrast both the frozen scattering matrix @xmath10 and @xmath113 have .",
    "the analysis of the micro - reversibility of the equations of motion gives the following symmetry : @xmath122 where the upper index `` @xmath123 '' denotes the transposition . in the absence of a magnetic field , @xmath124 , the matrix @xmath113 is antisymmetric in lead indices , @xmath125 .",
    "next , using the adiabatic expansion , ( [ eq14 ] ) , we calculate the full time - dependent current @xmath20 flowing in lead @xmath2 as follows @xcite : @xmath126     \\big|s_{\\alpha\\beta}(e , t)\\big|^2   \\\\ \\ \\\\ - e \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t }    \\left [ f_\\mathrm{0,\\beta}\\frac{\\d n_{\\alpha\\beta}(e , t)}{\\d e}\\right ]   + f_\\mathrm{0,\\beta } \\frac{\\d i_{\\alpha\\beta}(e , t)}{\\d e } \\bigg\\}.   \\end{array}\\ ] ] here @xmath127 is the fermi distribution function for electrons in reservoir @xmath2 .",
    "we assume a current in a lead to be positive if it is directed from the scatterer to the corresponding reservoir .",
    "equation ( [ eq17 ] ) generalizes ( [ eq3 ] ) to the case with external reservoirs being nonidentical ( e.g. , having different chemical potentials , temperatures , etc . ) .",
    "the three parts in the curly brackets on the rhs of ( [ eq17 ] ) can be interpreted as follows : the first part defines the currents injected from the external reservoirs .",
    "it depends on the time - dependent conductance @xmath128 of the frozen scatterer and hence it describes a classical rectification contribution to the dc current @xmath26 .",
    "the second part defines the current generated by the oscillating charge @xmath129 of the scatterer : @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the global partial density of states for a frozen scatterer : @xmath132 apparently this part gives no contribution to the dc current .",
    "the third part describes the currents generated by the oscillating scatterer .",
    "the ability to generate these ac currents differentiates a non - stationary dynamical scatterer from a merely frozen scatterer .",
    "the _ instantaneous spectral currents _",
    "@xmath133 pushed by the oscillating scatterer from lead @xmath39 to lead @xmath2 read : @xmath134 + \\frac{1}{2}{\\cal p}\\{s_{\\alpha\\beta } ; s^{*}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\ } \\big).\\ ] ] the two terms in this equation have different symmetry properties with respect to the interchange of lead indices .",
    "that is most evident in the absence of a magnetic field , @xmath124 . in this case",
    "the first term on the rhs of ( [ eq20 ] ) is antisymmetric in lead indices while the second term has the symmetry of the stationary scattering matrix @xmath10 and is thus symmetric .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath113 is responsible for the directional asymmetry of dynamically generated currents : @xmath135    we remark , that if one calculates the dc current generated in the particular case when all the reservoirs are at same potentials and temperatures ( @xmath136 ) then ( [ eq17 ] ) ( after averaging over a pump period ) generates brouwer s result , ( [ eq4 ] ) . in this case",
    "the matrix @xmath113 plays no role .",
    "different contributions of this matrix can be combined as in ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the matrix @xmath113 is important in less symmetrical situations , when the electron flows arriving at the scatterer from different leads are different",
    ".     leads to the creation of a non - equilibrium quasi  electron  hole pair .",
    "the quasi ",
    "electron ( black circle ) and hole ( open circle ) can leave the scattering region through different leads .",
    "this leads to current pulses of different signs in the corresponding leads .",
    ", height=151 ]      such a property supports the point of view that these currents arise inside the scatterer .",
    "they are generated by the non - stationary scatterer without any external current source .",
    "the appearance of currents subject to the conservation law ( [ eq22 ] ) can be easily illustrated within the quasi  particle picture @xcite .",

    "we introduce quasi ",
    "particles : the quasi  electrons corresponding to filled states with energy @xmath139 and holes corresponding to empty states with energy @xmath140 . then at zero temperature",

    "the system of ( real ) electrons can gain , say , @xmath141 energy quanta @xmath49 . in the quasi  particle picture this process corresponds to the creation of a quasi ",
    "hole pair with energy @xmath43 .",
    "the pair dissolves and the quasi  particles are scattered separately to the same or different leads , see , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . if the scattering matrix depends on energy then the quasi ",
    "electron and hole are scattered , on average , into different leads since they have different energies .",
    "suppose the electron leaves the scattering region through lead @xmath2 and the hole leaves through lead @xmath39 .",
    "since electrons and holes have opposite charge the current pulses created in the leads @xmath2 and @xmath39 have different sign . as a result",
    "a current pulse arises between the @xmath2 and @xmath39 reservoirs . in this picture",
    "it is evident that there is no incoming current and the sum of outgoing currents does satisfy the conservation law ( [ eq22 ] ) .",
    "the current @xmath20 , calculated with ( [ eq17 ] ) , satisfies the continuity equation : @xmath142 and thus conserves charge . to demonstrate this we use the unitarity of the frozen scattering matrix , @xmath143 , and the definition of the charge @xmath129 of the scatterer , see ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq22 ] ) that the dynamically generated currents @xmath133 do not contribute to ( [ eq23 ] ) .",
    "therefore they have nothing to do with charging / discharging of a scatterer .",
    "the existence of these currents is an intrinsic property of dynamical scatterer .    in conclusion , we clarified the role played by photon  assisted processes in adiabatic electron transport through a periodically driven mesoscopic system . the interference between the corresponding photon ",
