    "about half of the nuclei with @xmath0 observed in nature are formed by the so - called rapid neutron - capture process ( or r - process ) of nucleosynthesis , occurring in explosive stellar events .",
    "the r - process is believed to take place in environments characterized by high neutron densities ( @xmath1 ) , so that successive neutron captures proceed into neutron - rich regions well off the @xmath2-stability valley forming exotic nuclei that can not be produced and therefore studied in the laboratory .",
    "if the temperatures or the neutron densities characterizing the r - process are low enough to break the @xmath3 equilibrium , the r - abundance distribution depends directly on the neutron capture rates by the so - produced exotic neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "the neutron capture rates are commonly evaluated within the framework of the statistical model of hauser - feshbach ( although the direct capture contribution can play an important role for such exotic nuclei ) .",
    "this model makes the fundamental assumption that the capture process takes place with the intermediary formation of a compound nucleus in thermodynamic equilibrium . in this approach ,",
    "the maxwellian - averaged @xmath4 rate at temperatures of relevance in r - process environments strongly depends on the electromagnetic interaction , i.e the photon de - excitation probability .",
    "the well known challenge of understanding the r - process abundances thus requires that one be able to make reliable extrapolations of the e1-strength function out towards the neutron - drip line . to put the description of the r - process on safer grounds , a great effort must therefore be made to improve the reliability of the nuclear model .",
    "generally speaking ,",
    "the more microscopic the underlying theory , the greater will be one s confidence in the extrapolations out towards the neutron - drip line , provided , of course , the available experimental data are also well fitted .",
    "large scale prediction of e1-strength functions are usually performed using phenomenological lorentzian models of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) @xcite .",
    "several refinements can be made , such as the energy dependence of the width and its temperature dependence @xcite to describe all available experimental data .",
    "the lorentzian gdr approach suffers , however , from shortcomings of various sorts . on the one hand , it is unable to predict the enhancement of the e1 strength at energies around the neutron separation energy demonstrated by various experiments , such as the nuclear resonance fluorescence . on the other hand ,",
    "even if a lorentzian - like function provides a suitable representation of the e1 strength for stable nuclei , the location of its maximum and its width remain to be predicted from some systematics or underlying model for each nucleus . for astrophysical applications , these properties have often been obtained from a droplet - type model @xcite .",
    "this approach clearly lacks reliability when dealing with exotic nuclei , as already demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "recently an attempt was made to derive microscopically the e1 strength for the whole nuclear chart @xcite .",
    "the dipole response was calculated with the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) on top of hartree - fock+bcs ( hfbcs ) description @xcite .",
    "the only input of this approach was the skyrme effective interaction injected in the hfbcs model .",
    "these microscopic calculations predicted the presence of a systematic low - lying component in the e1 strength for very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "this low - lying component influences the neutron capture rate , especially if located in the vicinity of the neutron separation energy @xmath5 .    in our previous hfbcs and qrpa microscopic",
    "approach @xcite , the pairing correlation in the bcs model was determined assuming a simple constant - gap pairing interaction .",
    "in addition , in the case of the highly neutron - rich nuclei that are of particular interest in the context of the r - process , the validity of the bcs approach to pairing is questionable , essentially because of the role played by the continuum of single - particle neutron states ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "therefore the impact of the newly - derived e1-strength functions on the cross section prediction could only be evaluated qualitatively .",
    "it was found that the radiative neutron capture cross sections by neutron - rich nuclei were systematically increased by the hfbcs+qrpa calculations @xcite with respect to the one obtained using lorentzian - like strength functions .",
    "predictions with different forces have been compared , but no conclusions could be drawn regarding their intrinsic quality to predict the e1 strength .",
    "the final large - scale hfbcs+qrpa calculations performed in @xcite were obtained on the basis of the skyrme force denoted sly4 @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the dipole strength with one of the most accurate and reliable microscopic model available to date , namely the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) and qrpa models @xcite . as recalled in sect .",
    "2.1 , the ground state is described within the hfb model .",
    "effective interactions of the skyrme type characterized by different values of the nucleon effective mass and prescriptions for the pairing interaction are considered .",
    "the collective gdr mode is obtained by qrpa calculations on top of the hfb calculations , as described in sect .",
    "the residual interaction is derived self - consistently from the nucleon - nucleon effective interaction , which is the only input of the hfb calculation . to describe the damping of the collective motions on microscopic grounds , the second - rpa ( srpa ) described by @xcite",
    "is adopted ( sect .",
    "this approach strongly improves the reliability of the predictions by eliminating the phenomenological spreading of the qrpa strength determined in our previous hfbcs+qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "this new approach allows us to determine on a more quantitative and reliable ground the photoabsorption cross section and consequently to judge the ability of the forces to reproduce experimental data . in order to select the most adequate interaction for the e1-strength calculation , the hfb+qrpa prediction",
    "are compared with photoabsorption data for 48 spherical nuclei @xcite ( sect .  3 ) .",
    "the hfb+qrpa predictions are further compared , in sect .  3 , with low - energy experimental data and generalized to include deformation effects in a phenomenological way .",
    "all these drastic improvements compared to the previous hfbcs and qrpa models allow to provide quantitative predictions of the e1-strength function , also for exotic neutron - rich nuclei ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "the predicted gdr strengths are used to estimate all the radiative neutron capture rates of relevance for nucleosynthesis applications ( sect .",
    "the long - term goal of microscopic models is to describe on the same ground a wide variety of nuclear structure properties ( in particular , magicity and pairing correlations in open - shell nuclei ) for both stable and exotic nuclei .",
    "the hfb and qrpa models allows to treat , in a self - consistent way , pairing effects on the ground state as well as collective excitations for nuclei ranging from the valley of stability to the drip - line .",
    "the qrpa considers nuclear excitation as a collective superposition of two quasiparticle ( qp ) states built on top of the hfb ground state @xcite .",
    "this collective aspect of the excitation makes the qrpa an accurate tool to investigate the e1-strength function , in both closed and open shell nuclei .",
    "the hfb calculations considered in the present work are fully detailed in @xcite .",
    "they are based on the conventional skyrme force of the form @xmath6 the pairing force acting between like nucleons is treated in the full bogoliubov framework with a @xmath7-function pairing force of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath8~ \\delta(\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}_{ij } ) \\quad , \\label{eq_surf}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the density and @xmath10 its equilibrium value in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "two types of pairing forces are considered here , a volume density - independent force characterized by @xmath11 and a volume plus surface ( i.e density - dependent ) force with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this latter prescription originates from the calculations of the pairing gap in infinite nuclear matter at different densities performed by garrido et al .",
    "@xcite using a  bare \" or  realistic \" nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "this density - dependent pairing has also been found to be compatible with experimental nuclear masses by @xcite , provided the space of single - particle states over which such a pairing force is allowed to act is truncated to about @xmath14  mev around the fermi energy .",
    "note finally that in the present approach the strength parameter @xmath15 is allowed to be different for neutrons and protons , and also to be slightly stronger for an odd number of nucleons ( @xmath16 ) than for an even number ( @xmath17 ) , i.e. , the pairing force between neutrons , for example , depends on whether @xmath18 is even or odd . for odd-@xmath19 and odd - odd nuclei ,",
    "the blocking approximation is used , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "based on this skyrme - hfb approach , a number of effective forces have been determined recently @xcite , the parameters of the underlying forces being fitted _ exclusively _ to all the 2135 available experimental masses @xcite , with some additional constraints regarding the stability of neutron matter and the incompressibility of nuclear matter .",
    "the parameters corresponding to these six forces named bsk2-bsk7 are summarized in table  [ tab_sky ] .",
    "are also included in table  [ tab_sky ] the effective isoscalar ( @xmath20 ) , isovector ( @xmath21 ) nucleon mass and the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviations @xmath22 between the measured and estimated masses for the 2135 nuclei with @xmath23 .",
    "more details about these forces can be found in @xcite .",
    "the major differences between these six forces are found in the density - dependence of the pairing force and the adopted isoscalar effective nucleon mass . while bsk2 and bsk3 have been built without constraining the effective mass ( leading to a value of @xmath24 ) , bsk4 and bsk5 are constrained by @xmath25 , as inferred from the extended brckner - hartree - fock calculations of asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite and bsk6 and bsk7 by @xmath26 , as inspired from the more traditional symmetric nuclear - matter calculations ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "the mass - data fits with the bsk47 interaction are almost as good as those obtained with bsk23 , in which @xmath27 is unconstrained , so that such a mass fit can not be used to discriminate between the different skyrme forces and the corresponding optimal choice for the nucleon effective mass or the pairing interaction . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we also consider the sly4 skyrme force @xcite used in our previous hfbcs+qrpa calculation @xcite .",
    "the sly4 parameters are given in table  [ tab_sky ] , the pairing interaction corresponding to the one determined in @xcite ( the mass rms deviation is however not available for the sly4 force ) .",
    ".some properties of the skyrme forces bsk2-bsk7 and sly4 ( see text for more details ) .",
    "the last line corresponds to the rms deviation between predicted and experimental masses for the full set of 2135 spherical and deformed nuclei . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig_gdr1]-[fig_gdr3 ] and table  [ tab_cst ] , the prediction of the gdr parameters is force - dependent .",
    "as far as the position of the peak energy is concerned , most of the forces overpredict the peak energy of light nuclei and underpredict it for the heavier species .",
    "the best agreement is found for the bsk6 - 7 forces which still overestimate @xmath28 for the lightest elements , but give an excellent agreement for @xmath29 elements .",
    "it can be concluded that , within the present hfb+qrpa model , skyrme forces need to have a low effective nucleon mass @xmath30 to correctly predict the gdr characteristics .",
    "an effective mass as low as the one used in sly4 requires a particularly low value of the interference factor ( see table  [ tab_cst ] ) which simultaneously give rise to fine structure effects not observed experimentally ( see fig .  [ fig_gdr3 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the density dependence of the pairing interaction has a minor impact on the prediction of the e1-strength function .",
    "almost no differences are found among the 2 couples of forces bsk4 vs bsk5 or bsk6 vs bsk7 ( see in particular fig .  [ fig_gdr3 ] ) .",
    "finally , note that the srpa effect to shift the energy peak was not taken into account by the phenomenological lorentzian damping adopted in our previous hfbcs+qrpa work @xcite , and obviously modifies the conclusion drawn regarding the ability of the sly4 force to predict the location of the gdr . the agreement found here for the sly4 interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gdr3 ] ) is worse than it used to be in @xcite where an rms deviation of 0.457  mev was obtained on the centroid energy for the same sample of spherical nuclei .",
    "finally , regarding the amplitude of the e1-strength function , the qrpa equations are solved so as to exhaust the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule .",

    "[ fig_sigmax ] .",
    "the resulting deviation can be characterized by an rms deviation factor @xmath32 defined as @xmath33^{1/2 } \\label{eq_rms}\\ ] ] where @xmath34(@xmath35 ) is the theoretical ( experimental ) peak cross section and @xmath36 the number of nuclei in the experimental sample .",
    "all these results show that among the six skyrme forces studied here , both the bsk6 and bsk7 forces not only reproduce extremely well the experimental masses ( with a rms deviation as low as 0.676  mev on the 2135 known masses ) , but also is well adapted to describe the e1 collective excitations . for this reason ,",
    "all further calculations are performed with bsk7 as our standard force .",
    "it should be stressed that for more than thirty years , phenomenological effective interactions were developed using exclusively ground state properties of nuclei , such as binding energies , radii or spectroscopic quantities .",
    "this was initiated through the skyrme hartree - fock model by @xcite .",
    "nuclear forces are traditionally determined by fitting such ground state properties for less than ten or so nuclei .",
    "recently , progress has been achieved in determining the skyrme force by fitting essentially all the mass data @xcite . the only excited feature taken into account",
    "so far was the giant monopolar resonance energy @xcite in order to predict the infinite matter compressibility modulus .",
    "the present hfb+qrpa model ( with the srpa corrections ) allows to consider nuclear excitations such as gdr in the development of phenomenological effective interactions .      in the case of deformed spheroidal nuclei ,",
    "the gdr splits into two major resonances as a result of the different resonance conditions characterizing the oscillations of protons against neutrons along the axis of rotational symmetry and an arbitrary axis perpendicular to it . in the phenomenological approach ,",
    "the lorentzian - type formula is generalized to a sum of two lorentzian - type functions of energies @xmath37 and width @xmath38 @xcite , such that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ratio of the diameter along the axis of symmetry to the diameter along an axis perpendicular to it . in turn , the width @xmath38 of each peak is given by the same deformation dependence as the respective energy @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "the same deformation effects are applied to all nuclei predicted to be deformed by the hfb calculation based on the bsk7 force .      for practical astrophysics applications ,",
    "it is of first importance to describe the tail of the gdr at low energies , i.e around the neutron separation energy , as reliably as possible @xcite .",
    "experimental e1 strengths at low energies are available through average resonance capture ( arc ) data @xcite or recent measurements of @xmath44-ray spectra in light - ion reactions @xcite . however , such data are related to the so - called `` downwards '' e1-strength function which determines the average width of the @xmath44-decay , while the photoexcitation data considered so far depend on the `` upwards '' e1-strength function associated with @xmath44-absorption .",
    "when dealing with @xmath44-decay data , a temperature - dependent correction factor is traditionally introduced in the expression of the gdr width to take the collision of quasiparticles into account @xcite . in order to guarantee the compatibility with photoabsorption data , we introduce in the srpa procedure such a collision term by adding to the width @xmath42 ( see eq .",

    "r - process nuclei characterized by @xmath64  mev are seen to have a neutron capture rate about at least twice faster than the one predicted with the phenomenological hybrid formula .",

    "<S> large - scale qrpa calculations of the e1 strength are performed on top of hfb calculations in order to derive the radiative neutron capture cross sections for the whole nuclear chart . </S>",
    "<S> the spreading width of the gdr is taken into account by analogy with the second - rpa ( srpa ) method . the accuracy of hfb+qrpa model based on various skyrme forces with different pairing prescription and parameterization is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the present model allows to constrain the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction with the gdr data and to provide quantitative predictions of dipole strengths .    </S>",
