    "furthermore , the eigenfunctions converge as well .",
    "the _ uniformity conditions _ are precisely stated in section  [ sec : ass.graph ] .",

    "section  [ sec : emb.graph ] ) the uniformity conditions mean in particular , that we need a global bound on the curvature of an edge and a global lower bound on the angle between two different edges at a vertex _ although _ both quantities do not enter into the limit operator and space .",

    "@xcite ) we allow here _ infinite _ structures , i.e. , we drop the condition of _ compactness _ of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we can not use the variational principle in order to characterise the discrete spectrum .",
    "the appropriate substitute is an abstract convergence criterion provided in appendix  [ sec : abstr.mod ] .",
    "the basic idea is to define a `` distance '' between the operators @xmath3 and @xmath2 with suitable identification operators ( cf .  definition  [ def : closeness ] ) .",
    "we have formulated the abstract results fully in terms of this `` distance '' in order to trace the parameter dependence on @xmath11 of the operator @xmath2 , the hilbert space @xmath28 _ and _ the identification operators between the graph and the manifold .",
    "the `` distance '' can be calculated in terms of the associated sesquilinear forms which makes the verification quite simple in our main model . as a consequence ,",
    "we show norm resolvent convergence which implies all other convergence results like convergence of the spectral projections , convergence of the eigenfunctions and convergence of the spectra .",
    "note that in  @xcite , only convergence of eigenvalues has been established .",
    "our results here show , that the eigenvectors converge as well .",
    "we will show in a forthcoming paper that this abstract convergence criterium has applications in other geometrical situations .    a related result on _ non - compact _ spaces has been established in  @xcite .",

    "@xcite the authors prove _ exact _ relations ( equality , inclusion ) of the essential spectrum of the neumann laplacian on a thickened tree ( for fixed @xmath11 in our notation ) and the corresponding metric graph .",
    "our spectral convergence result has many applications in different situations : first , we can consider graph - like manifolds as a kind of toolbox in order to construct manifolds with prescribed spectrum , at least approximately .",
    "for example , we are able to construct manifolds with gaps in the essential spectrum ( cf .  thms .",
    "[ thm : gaps ] ,  [ thm : ew.graph ]  ) also in the non - periodic case : using the recent result on _ graph decoration",
    "_ one can construct metric graphs with spectral gaps ( cf .",
    "@xcite and section  [ sec : examples ] ) . our spectral convergence result",
    "then immediately states that an associated graph - like manifold also has gaps . in the periodic case ( i.e. , on covering spaces with compact quotient )",
    ", we have of course the same result once we ensure the existence of gaps on the quantum graph . for the existence of spectral gaps on periodic manifolds ( not necessarily graph - like in our sense ) we refer to  @xcite and the references therein . the periodic case can often be reduced to the spectral convergence on a compact space .",
    "an example with arbitrary many gaps in a _ compact _",
    "spectral interval is given by a fractal - like manifold in  theorem  [ thm : sierpinski ] .",
    "the graph - like manifold is constructed according to a sierpiski graph .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the discrete laplacian on a sierpiski graph has pure point spectrum which is purely essential and of fractal nature .",
    "using a nice relation between the spectrum of the discrete graph laplacian and the metric graph laplacian with constant edge length @xmath30 developed in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thm : disc.met ] ) we are able to construct a family of graph - like manifolds @xmath0 such that the spectrum of @xmath2 approaches a fractal set . in particular , the spectrum of @xmath2 has an arbitrary ( a priori finite ) number of spectral gaps in the _ compact _ interval @xmath31 $ ] provided @xmath11 is small enough .",
    "such fractal manifolds have been constructed in  @xcite in order to provide examples of smooth spaces sharing properties of fractal spaces in large scales ( e.g.  heat kernel estimates ) .",
    "finally , our result shows rigorously , that the physically intuition of modeling quasi - one - dimensional spaces by its singular limit is correct , also on _ infinite _ structures .",
    "graph models have a long history in modeling properties of networks , complicated organic molecules  @xcite or quite recently , nanostructures , i.e. , structures , which are too small to be considered classically , but still too large to be described on a conventional quantum level , see e.g.  @xcite . on the one side quantum graphs provide a solvable model in quantum mechanics in the sense that many quantities can be calculated explicitely essentially by solving systems of odes . on the other side ,",
    "the structure of a metric graph is still rich enough in order to provide a good model for branched structures .",
    "for example , a spectral gap corresponds to `` forbidden modes '' , i.e. , a particle with an energy in the gap can not propagate through the system . in this sense , transport properties on @xmath0",
    "are approximately described by the quantum graph @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , a bound state ( of finite degeneracy ) on @xmath0 ( i.e. , an eigenfunction corresponding to a discrete eigenvalue ) can be approximated by its ( mostly explicitly known ) eigenvector on @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ thm : ew.graph ] ) . in a forthcoming paper  @xcite",
    "we will deal with the convergence of resonances , i.e. , eigenvalues of a suitable dilated hamiltonian .",
    "the methods needed there differ from the ones given in  appendix  [ sec : abstr.mod ] since the dilated operators are no longer self - adjoint ( even not normal ) .    with our methods here ,",
    "we consider the discrete and the essential spectrum only since they can be characterised by the dimension of spectral projections .",
    "a finer analysis of the spectrum needs more elaborated methods , such as scattering theory .",
    "our results presented here are considered as a first step in dealing with the above - mentioned structures .",
    "we will concentrate on the relation between scattering and transport properties on the two systems in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : graph ] we define properly graph - like manifolds and metric graphs and show that the abstract convergence result can be used in this situation for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in section",
    "[ sec : ex.app ] we discuss various examples of graph - like manifolds to which our result applies .",
    "we also derive several consequences of the spectral convergence . in appendix  [ sec : abstr.mod ] we develop the abstract framework in order to show the spectral convergence for arbitrary pairs @xmath34 and @xmath35 being at a `` distance '' @xmath36 to each other .",
    "in this section we apply the abstract setting developed in appendix  [ sec : abstr.mod ] to the example of a family of manifolds @xmath0 converging to a ( metric ) graph @xmath1 .",
    "this situation has already been treated in a quite general way in  @xcite based on  @xcite with the only restriction that the graph is _ compact _",
    "( i.e. , finite and each edge has finite length ) and each manifold @xmath0 is _",
    "compact_. under these assumptions , the spectra of the operators considered are purely discrete ( for a precise definition see below ) .",
    "the main result in  @xcite states that the @xmath37-th eigenvalue of the laplacian @xmath2 converges to the @xmath37-th eigenvalue of the limit operator .",
    "the proof uses the min - max principle and comparison of the appropriate rayleigh quotients .    if the manifold and the metric graph are non - compact , more elaborated methods are needed .",
    "namely , we establish in appendix  [ sec : abstr.mod ] norm resolvent convergence from which all other convergence results follow .",
    "the norm resolvent convergence is reduced to the verification of several natural conditions provided in definition  [ def : closeness ] . in order that these conditions are satisfied we need the uniformity assumptions   in our model .",
    "the eigenvalue convergence already proven in  @xcite appears as a special case ( cf .",
    "corollary  [ cor : ev.conv ] ) .",

    "in addition , we assume that @xmath53 always consists of two elements , even if @xmath54 for a loop @xmath9 .",

    "we stress that our graphs need by no way to be embedded in some euclidean space .",
    "note that for a metric graph , the notion `` compact '' and `` finite '' have a different meaning : a _ finite _ metric graph is a graph with finitely many vertices and edges , whereas a _ compact _",
    "graph must in addition have finite edge length for each edge .",
