    "the first soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) to be discovered , sgr 0526 - 66 @xcite , was shown soon after its discovery to be positionally coincident with the n49 supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "more recently , the other two sgrs ( sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 ) have also been associated with supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that sgrs originate from young neutron stars",
    ".    for a variety of reasons , summarized in @xcite , a popular class of models for sgrs assumes that these neutron stars have very strong surface magnetic fields , on the order of @xmath2 g . these models are extremely complicated , and many of their properties depend on microscopic physical processes that are important only in very strong magnetic fields . here",
    "we concentrate on the effects of vacuum polarization and , in particular , on the spectral effects of the second vacuum frequency .    in strong magnetic fields @xmath3 , where @xmath4 g is the magnetic field at which the electron cyclotron energy equals the electron rest mass energy , vacuum polarization effects due to virtual @xmath5 pairs can become significant ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "in fact , for strong enough fields the vacuum contribution to the dielectric tensor can exceed the plasma contribution @xcite .",
    "this affects the photon normal modes and cross sections .",
    "well below the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath6 , the normal modes for photons in a very strong magnetic field are nearly linearly polarized over most photon frequencies and incident angles .    at photon frequencies",
    "@xmath7 , the scattering cross section depends strongly on the polarization of the photon . if the electric field vector of the photon is in the plane formed by the magnetic field and the photon propagation direction @xmath8 , the photon is in the parallel mode and the scattering cross section @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the thomson cross section",
    ". however , if the electric field vector of the photon is perpendicular to the @xmath11 plane , the photon is in the perpendicular mode and @xmath12 .",
    "this reduction in the cross section is understandable , because in a strong magnetic field it is easier to oscillate an electron along the field than to oscillate it across the field .",
    "there is , however , a small range of photon frequencies in which the vacuum and plasma contributions to the dielectric tensor are comparable to each other and the normal modes become strongly nonorthogonal over a broad range of angles .",
    "this frequency , called the second vacuum frequency ( the first vacuum frequency is near the cyclotron frequency ) , depends on the magnetic field and density : @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 . when @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "figure  1 shows the dependence of cross section on photon energy for both polarization modes for @xmath19 g @xmath20 and @xmath21 g @xmath20 when @xmath22 .",
    "this figure shows that at any particular density the cross section is unusually high for a narrow range of frequencies .",
    "conversely , if we assume that most of the flux is transported in the lower cross section mode , for any photon frequency there is a density at which the cross section is high .",
    "thus , the optical depth for a photon is greater than it would be in the absence of the enhanced cross section at @xmath23 .",
    "because the frequency of the resonance varies with density , in an atmosphere of varying density the vacuum resonance has an effect on the spectrum in a wide range of photon energies .",
    "as described in , e.g. , @xcite , the scattering cross section depends on the parameter @xmath24\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the angle of propagation with respect to the magnetic field , @xmath26 is the fine structure constant , @xmath27 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are functions of the magnetic field related to the indices of refraction of the two normal modes @xcite . when @xmath30 the scattering is non - resonant and the perpendicular mode has @xmath31 . when @xmath32 the scattering is resonant and the cross section in either mode is @xmath33 .",
    "the second vacuum frequency is @xmath34 because @xmath35 , as radiation propagates from regions of high density to regions of low density the frequency of the vacuum resonance changes . in effect",
    ", the resonance acts as a sliding high opacity barrier .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that the resonance will lower the flux at a given frequency if a ) the optical depth through the resonance is greater than unity , and b ) the optical depth to the surface without the resonance is less than unity .",
    "these requirements give us , respectively , the minimum and maximum photon energies at which the vacuum resonance strongly affects the spectrum .",
    "as we show in @xcite , for @xmath14 and an atmosphere of scale height @xmath36 , this simple analytical treatment gives minimum and maximum photon energies @xmath37 if instead @xmath16 , @xmath38 the scalings with magnetic field and scale height are confirmed by our numerical results ( see @xcite and the following section ) : typically @xmath39 kev and @xmath40 kev , if the radiation is produced deep in the atmosphere .",
    "to synthesize spectra , we use a monte carlo code and propagate 100,000 photons through an atmosphere that is exponential in density .",
    "the input spectrum is a 10 kev blackbody , and for the spectra shown here the magnetic field is @xmath22 . in figure",
    "2 we show two of our model spectra , one with a scale height @xmath41 cm and the other with @xmath42 cm .",
    "we find ( see also @xcite ) that below @xmath15 kev the spectral shape is dominated by free - free absorption and induced scattering , whereas above @xmath15 kev direct compton scattering is most important .",
    "as expected , for photon energies between @xmath43 and @xmath44 the extra opacity created by the vacuum resonance causes a deficit in the spectrum , and the upper range of this deficit decreases with increasing scale height , as predicted by the analytical model above . for @xmath41",
    "cm an absorption - like feature is seen , whereas for @xmath42 cm the feature would be evident as a low - energy falloff . in principle , a transition from a falloff to an absorption - like feature would be expected as the source goes from its bursting phase into an afterglow , and observation of such a spectral transition would be evidence for very strong magnetic fields .",
    "note also that the high - energy continuum is steeper than the input blackbody , because the mean free path of photons to scattering goes as @xmath45 , which shifts the distribution of escaping photons to lower energies .",
    "it is essential to include the effects of mode switching in these simulations . at temperatures of @xmath110",
    "kev the energy change of a photon in a single scattering is much greater than the width of the vacuum resonance .",
    "thus , in the @xmath4650% of scatterings in the resonance when the photon switches modes , the photon will be comptonized out of the resonance and may require several thousand scatterings to return to the low cross section mode , during which its fractional energy change can be of order unity .",
    "however , the mean free path in the parallel mode is small enough that the net distance traveled in the parallel mode is negligible .",
    "for magnetic fields and plasma densities like those expected in sgrs , photon scattering is strongly affected by the vacuum resonance . we find that the increased opacity caused by this resonance typically creates a falloff or absorption - like feature in the spectrum at @xmath47 kev to 40 kev .",
    "the spectral energy and shape of the feature depend on quantities such as the magnetic field and scale height of the atmosphere .",
    "since scattering opacity is likely to dominate over absorption opacity in the high - temperature environments of sgrs , the effects of the vacuum resonance must be included in any detailed calculations of radiative transfer through strongly magnetized atmospheres ."
