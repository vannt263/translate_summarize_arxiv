    "today a fairly large number of papers have addressed the problem of calculating point - contact conductance for use in analyzing and interpreting scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments ( for reviews see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the low symmetry of the problem and the wide variety of objects under study do not allow developing a general theory of stm , and different approaches for specific problems are used .",
    "the theory papers on this subject can be divided into two groups : one uses methods taking into account the specific atomic structure of the stm tip and that of the test specimen .",
    "these methods make it possible to reproduce the crystallographic structure of the sample surface in the calculated stm images and this is very useful for arriving at a correct interpretation of experimental data .",
    "the main deficiency of this approach is the lack of analytical formulas for the stm current - voltage characteristics as numerical calculations must be performed for every specific case .",
    "the other group of works exploit simplified models of noninteracting electrons which allows finding relatively simple analytical expressions that describe the stm current qualitatively . for this reason",
    "such theoretical results are widely used by experimentalists .",
    "one of the first free - electron models describing stm experiments was proposed by tersoff and hamann @xcite whose theoretical analysis of tunnel current is based on bardeen s formalism @xcite , in which a tunneling matrix element is expressed by means of independent wave functions for the tip and the sample within the barrier region . using the model wave functions the authors @xcite showed that the conductance of the system is proportional to the local density of states of the sample at the tip position . in principle",
    "it is possible to extract information on subsurface objects ( single defects , clusters , interfaces etc . ) by stm , but this requires a more detailed theoretical analysis @xcite , which takes into account the influence of subsurface electron scattering on the tunneling current .",
    "the physical picture of an electron tunneling through a classically forbidden region is that the electron flow emerging from the barrier is defined by the matching of the wave functions of carriers incident on the barrier and those that are transmitted .",
    "for a three dimensional stm geometry the wave functions for electrons transmitted through the vacuum region radically differs from the electron wave functions in an isolated sample and they describe the electron propagation into the bulk from a small region on the surface below the stm tip . in contrast , the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite and its modifications ( see  @xcite and references therein ) uses unperturbed wave functions of the surface bloch states .",

    "later these authors showed that that the lattice structure of an interface buried under a film of pb , whose thickness can be as many as 10 times the fermi wavelength , can be clearly imaged with stm @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the key to the transparency of a metal lies in a highly anisotropic motion of the electrons and the strong quantization of their transverse wave function components . in the paper",
    "@xcite the electronic states of thin ag films grown on gaas(110 ) surfaces was investigated by stm with single - layer thickness resolution , and the quantum - well states arising from the confinement geometry of the ag films have been identified .",
    "quantum size effects , manifested in the formation of new electronic bound states , were investigated by stm on thin pb islands of varying heights on the si(111)-(7@xmath37 ) surface in ref.@xcite . in experiments @xcite it was demonstrated that scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of epitaxial pb islands on si(111 ) reveal adiabatic lateral modulation of the energy spectra of the quantum well , providing remote electronic images of the subsurface reflection phase . in ref .",
    "@xcite a step structure at the buried pb on si(111 ) 6@xmath46-au interface was determined by utilizing the presence of quantum well states .",
    "it was demonstrated that the spatial step positions as well as the step heights can be extracted nondestructively and with atomic layer precision by stm .",
    "vertical friedel oscillations in interface - induced surface charge modulations of pb islands of a few atomic layers on the incommensurate si(111)-pb surface have been observed @xcite .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that a study of @xmath2 for both signs of the voltage maps the spectrum of energy levels above and below fermi surface in scanning tunneling experiments . </S>"
