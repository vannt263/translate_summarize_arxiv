    "fu orionis - like outbursts ( hereafter fuors ) are the most dramatic events among episodic accretion phenomena in ysos , displaying a mass accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) increase by several orders of magnitude  ( up to @xmath210@xmath3m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the yso brightness is boosted by 5 magnitudes or more in the optical  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these bursts have a dramatic impact on the yso circumstellar environment  @xcite .",
    "the rise times of these outbursts are usually short ( from several months to a few years ) , whereas the decay timescales range from years to several decades .",
    "spectra of fuor progenitors have only been obtained in two cases , both indicating that they are low - mass ysos  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of bursts in fuors is not well understood , and disk instabilities , disk fragmentation , and/or disk perturbation by an external body are the most viable hypotheses  ( see review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "several models with thermal or gravitational plus magneto - rotational instabilities are able to mimic the main characteristics of the outbursts  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "notably , the recent version of the disk gravitational instability and fragmentation model by @xcite reproduces the physical properties including the episodic nature of the bursts . aside from internal instabilities , external triggers ,",

    "the outburst was detected on the 23rd of november 2014  @xcite , and previous observations indicate that the object began its slow rise at the end of 2013 and reached its maximum at the end of 2014  @xcite . from archival photometric data ,",
    "@xcite identify the progenitor as a low - mass t tauri star ( 0.75m@xmath4 ) with a circumstellar disk of 0.010.06m@xmath4 , and an age of @xmath610@xmath7yr .",

    "the observations were performed with the highest spatial sampling ( 12.5 milliarcseconds - mas - pixel scale , and field of view - fov - of 08@xmath1108 ) and in ao - assisted mode ( using the target as a natural guide star ) with a mean optical seeing of @xmath12 , which provided a full - width at half maximum ( measured on the point spread function - psf ) of @xmath13mas and @xmath14mas in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 band , respectively .",
    "the detector integration time ( dit ) , number of sub - exposures per frame ( ndits ) and exposures were 30s , 4 , and 5 ( @xmath8 band ) , and 15s , 5 , and 7 ( @xmath9 band ) , for a total integration time on - source of 600s and 525s in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 band , respectively .",
    "an additional photometric standard star ( hd 42655 ) was observed for flux calibration of the data cubes and removal of telluric features from the spectra .",
    "data were reduced using the sinfoni data reduction pipeline in gasgano  @xcite , that is , dark and bad pixel masks , flat - field corrections , optical distortion correction , and wavelength calibration with arc lamps .",
    "two spectra were extracted from each data cube using a 5@xmath115 pixel area centered at the position of the peak flux of the fuor and its companion ( @xmath15 , see sect .  [ results ] ) . due to the fuor brightness and",
    "its spatially extended disk - like emission ( see sect .",
    "[ results ] ) , a background spectrum was extracted close to the companion position and subtracted from its spectrum to remove the contamination from the fuor source .    additionally , continuum images ( at 1.25 and 2.2@xmath16 m ) and continuum - subtracted pa@xmath17 and br@xmath18 images were created following the same procedures as in @xcite and @xcite .    as no psf standard was observed , to remove the fuor s psf from the continuum and evaluate the asymmetry of the bright central core ( see sect .",

    "as illustrated in fig .  1 ,",
    "sinfoni data cubes in both bands show three main features around 2massj06593158 - 0405277 : _",
    "i ) _ a faint companion ( hereafter 2massj06593158 - 0405277b or @xmath15 ) located at 227mas  ( or 102au in projection at a distance of 450pc  2.3kpc  @xcite ] , see * ? ? ?",

    "* see also left panels of fig .",
    "1 ) ; _ iii ) _ a bright asymmetric central core of the fuor source , which has a ` bump ' towards the southwest , clearly detected after subtracting the fuor s rotated images ( see central panels of fig .  1 )",
    ". moreover , both pa@xmath17 and br@xmath18 lines in emission are detected at the position of 2massj06593158 - 0405277b and near the continuum emission of the ` bump ' , as shown in the right panels of fig .  1 .",
    "on the basis of gaussian fitting of both @xmath8 and @xmath9-band data cubes , we infer the following coordinates for @xmath15 : r.a.(j2000)=06:59:31.599 , dec.(j2000)=-04:05:28.01 , that is , its separation from the fuor is @xmath20=015 , @xmath21=-017 , with a p.a.=1314 .",
    "our psf fitting allows us to derive @xmath8 and @xmath9-band magnitudes of 14.8@xmath220.4mag and 12.9@xmath220.2mag , respectively .",
    "the photometric uncertainties mostly arise from the bright background due to the scattered light from the fuor . in the upper panel of figure  [ fig2 ]",
    ", we show the flux calibrated spectrum in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands .",
    "the spectrum was obtained after subtracting the fuor scattered light in the background ( see sect .  [ observations ] ) .",
    "the spectrum shows several broad molecular absorption bands from h@xmath23o ( 1.1 , 1.4 , 1.9 , and 2.4@xmath16 m ) , co ( bandheads v=2 - 0 , 3 - 1 , 4 - 2 , 5 - 3 from 2.29@xmath16 m in the @xmath9 band ) , and , possibly , feh in the @xmath8 band , as well as atomic absorption lines ( and ) in the @xmath9 band .",
    "these absorption features have a photospheric origin , and are distinctive of late m - type stars  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we use near - ir spectra of very low - mass and brown - dwarfs ysos from @xcite to constrain the spectral type of @xmath15 . the inferred spectral type ( spt )",

    "we use the @xmath30 color excess of 2massj06593158 - 0405277b and an spt = m7  ( with @xmath31=1 ; see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate both upper and lower values of the visual extinction ( @xmath32 ) towards the source , adopting the extinction law from @xcite . indeed , by assuming that the observed @xmath33 is only due to the visual extinction",
    ", we get an upper limit of @xmath32=5mag from @xmath34 / 0.17 $ ] .",
    "this is only an upper limit , because this source is young and thus part of its ir excess originates from veiling ( @xmath35 = @xmath36 ) .",
    "the ir excess is thus :    @xmath37    we can not derive both @xmath38 and @xmath39 values .",
    "however , by assuming @xmath38=0 and fitting an spt = m7 template , we then get @xmath39@xmath02.6 , and we can infer a lower limit for the visual extinction of @xmath32=2.4mag .",
    "the spectrum of 2massj06593158 - 0405277b ( see upper panel of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) also displays lines in emission , namely the pa@xmath17 line at 1.282@xmath16 m ( @xmath40 = ( 2.4@xmath220.1)@xmath1110@xmath41ergs@xmath5@xmath42 ) and the br@xmath18 line at 2.166@xmath16 m ( @xmath40 = ( 6@xmath222)@xmath1110@xmath41ergs@xmath5@xmath42 ) .",
    "these lines are associated with ongoing accretion  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can be employed to derive an estimate of the mass accretion rate  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the empirical relations by @xcite ,",
    "this translates into an average accretion luminosity of @xmath43=0.005 - 0.01l@xmath28 .",
    "the mass accretion rate can then be expressed as @xmath44  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "inferred values are between 4@xmath1110@xmath45 and 8@xmath1110@xmath46m@xmath28yr@xmath5 , consistent with accretion rates found in young brown dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 band continuum images in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left panels ) display an elongated disk - like structure extending up to @xmath0200mas ( or @xmath090au ) from the central source .",
    "elliptical isophotes were fitted to the disk - like feature using the iraf stsdas task _ isophote _ , starting from radii larger than the central psf ( i.e. @xmath050mas and @xmath070mas in the @xmath8- and @xmath9-band , respectively ) .",
    "the isophotal fit in the @xmath8-band provides us with a semi - major axis p.a .",
    "of 52@xmath19@xmath223@xmath19 , and a ratio of the minor to major axes of 0.88@xmath220.05 .",
    "assuming circular symmetry , the system axis inclination with respect to the line - of - sight is i=28@xmath19@xmath226@xmath19 .",
    "results of the @xmath9 band analysis are less accurate but consistent with the previous ones , yielding p.a.=48@xmath19@xmath2210@xmath19 and i=22@xmath19@xmath2212@xmath19 .",
    "our analysis thus indicates that this disk - like structure is almost face - on .",
    "another notable circumstellar feature around 2massj06593158 - 0405277 is the ` bump ' detected in continuum and line emission images ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] , central and right panels ) .",
    "this feature is not spatially resolved in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 band images , but it is clearly detected after subtracting the rotated images ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , central panels ) as an arc - shaped elongated feature , peaking at p.a@xmath0233@xmath19 and @xmath0225@xmath19 in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands , respectively , and with m@xmath47@xmath012.9mag and m@xmath48@xmath010.6mag . in the continuum - subtracted pa@xmath17 and br@xmath18 images ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right panels ) , the ` bump ' emission appears as a point - like source , well fitted with a gaussian profile .",
    "its coordinates are r.a.(j2000)=06:59:31.588 , dec.(j2000)=-04:05:27.86 , i.e. it is at @xmath20=-15mas , @xmath21=-20mas from the fuor , that is @xmath49=25mas ( or 11.25au ) , with a p.a.=2331 .",
    "a rough estimate of the pa@xmath17 and br@xmath18 line fluxes gives @xmath07@xmath1110@xmath41 and 2@xmath1110@xmath41ergs@xmath5@xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the detection in both continuum - subtracted line images , the fact that these features are fitted with gaussian profiles , and the presence of continuum emission in the psf - subtracted @xmath8 and @xmath9 band images strongly suggest that the ` bump ' is an additional closer young companion , which might have triggered the burst  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands , the ` bump ' appears brighter than 2massj06593158 - 0405277b , hinting that , if it is a yso , it might be more massive than the latter . however , as the ` bump ' is not spatially resolved in the continuum , other scenarios can not be completely ruled out for the continuum emission , such as an uneven disk illumination  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "finally , the lower panels of fig .  [ fig2 ] show the fuor flux calibrated spectrum ( @xmath50=8.63@xmath220.05mag and @xmath51=7.45@xmath220.04mag ) , which only exhibits molecular and atomic features in absorption , as usually observed in fuor spectra , namely h@xmath23o , co , ( pa@xmath17 and br@xmath18 ) , , , , , and . from these features",
    "we infer a spectral type between k9 and m1 , typical of fuor nir spectra  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "notably , this spectrum closely resembles that of , a well studied fuor  ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of binaries or higher order systems in fuors is potentially of great importance , as interaction with a companion could be a triggering mechanism , although , in principle , there might be more than one .",
    "for example , a couple of fuors ( v1057cyg and v1515cyg ) are probably single systems  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , thus , in this case , internal instabilities seem to be the most straightforward process to consider . on the other hand , a large number of fuors and fuor candidates are binaries , and @xcite first proposed that fuor events may be triggered by the passage of a close companion .",
    "later on , @xcite suggested that these objects might be newborn binaries , which arise from the breaking of unstable triple systems  ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as a consequence of the dynamical interaction , one object is ejected , typically the lowest mass component , whereas the remaining two objects spiral in toward each other perturbing their disks .",
    "the bursts would be then triggered by the close passage ( @xmath010au ) of the nearest companion .",
    "this scheme is a plausible explanation for what we are observing in 2mass j06593158 - 0405277 .",
    "the central object is a fuor , whose burst might have been triggered by a close companion ( the ` bump ' ) located at @xmath011au , and there is a more distant ( @xmath0100au ) and less massive object , which could be the third ( ejected ? ) companion of a non - hierarchical system  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "notably , the present configuration is precisely what would be expected from the dynamical evolution of a newborn triple system , where the least massive of three bodies is kept away from the two other bodies except for brief periastron passages , which eventually lead to the system dissolution  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at an age of @xmath01myr the observed system is statistically unlikely to be stable , and it will eventually eject the low - mass component after a periastron passage .",
    "this could be the first time that such scenario has been observed .",
    "indeed companions in other fuors have been detected  ( e.g. , fu ori , zcma , l1551irs5 , rno 1b / c , ar 6a / b ; see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but their relatively wide separation ( from several tens up to hundreds of au ) suggests that these sources might be outlying companions .    in the case of 2mass j06593158 - 0405277 , the fact that both the ` bump ' and source ` b ' are young objects excludes the possibility that they might be background or foreground stars .",
    "instead it is much more likely that they belong to the same star forming region , which is quite small and isolated , being composed of a few ttauri stars  @xcite .",
    "their proximity to the fuor and the fact that the observed radial velocities of the hi lines are very similar in the three objects ( average @xmath52@xmath07@xmath227kms@xmath5 with respect to the local standard of rest -lsr- and not corrected for the molecular cloud velocity ) suggests that these sources might belong to the same system .",
    "provided that the objects are physically linked , 2massj06593158 - 0405277 would then be one of the very few triple systems ever observed in fuors .",
    "that said , further high - angular resolution observations are required to confirm the nature of the ` bump ' and the multiplicity of the 2mass j06593158 - 0405277 system .                        , f. , abuter , r. , bickert , k. , et  al . 2003 , in society of photo - optical instrumentation engineers ( spie ) conference series , vol . 4841 , instrument design and performance for optical / infrared ground - based telescopes , ed . m.  iye & a.  f.  m. moorwood , 15481561"
