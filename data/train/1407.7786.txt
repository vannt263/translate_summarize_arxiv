    "because accurate error bounds are seldomly available , we test a large variety of approaches , which we require to be stable , accurate , fast , and robust within the parameter and variable regions for which they have been selected .",
    "this is especially important when working with finite - precision arithmetic .",
    "the computation of confluent hypergeometric functions and gauss hypergeometric functions is important in a wide variety of applications @xcite .",
    "for instance , these functions arise in areas such as photon scattering from atoms @xcite , networks @xcite , coulomb wave functions @xcite , binary stars @xcite , mathematical finance @xcite , non - newtonian fluids @xcite and more .    except for specific situations , computing hypergeometric functions is difficult in practice .",
    "a plethora of methods exist for computing each hypergeometric function ; these include taylor series , asymptotic expansions , continued fractions , recurrence relationships , hyperasymptotic expansions , and more .",
    "however , each method is only reliable and efficient for limited parameter and variable regimes . consequently , one must be prepared to use different members of this suite of possibilities in different regimes of parameter and variable values .",
    "we have also developed matlab code for computing the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 using a range of methods ; this code is available at @xcite .",
    "the confluent hypergeometric function is defined by @xcite @xmath10 where the * pochhammer symbol * @xmath11 is @xmath12 the function @xmath13 is entire ( i.e. , it is analytic throughout the complex plane @xmath14 ) in the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the variable @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the sum always converges .",
    "when @xmath7 is a non - positive integer , we define @xmath15 which is also commonly denoted by @xmath16 and is itself often referred to as the confluent hypergeometric function . because @xmath2 is not defined if @xmath7 is equal to a non - positive integer and there are numerical issues in its computation if @xmath7 is close to a non - positive integer , it is preferable to compute @xmath13 when possible .",
    "the gauss hypergeometric function is defined within the unit disk @xmath17 by @xcite @xmath18 and defined outside of the unit disk by analytic continuation , with a principal branch cut along @xmath19 .",

[",
    "fig : hyperegs ] and [ fig : hyperegscomplex ] , we show plots of hypergeometric functions . these provide examples of the possible shapes of such functions in the real and complex planes , though of course there are a wide range of possible representations of them .    as we indicated above",
    ", the computation of hypergeometric functions arises in a wide variety of applications .",
    "this underscores the importance of determining which computational techniques will be accurate and efficient for different parameter and variable regimes .",
    "it is also important to supply information on how to test the reliability of a routine , provide test cases that a routine might have difficulty computing ( see appendix [ sec : appendixa ] ) , and indicate how to evaluate other special functions required for the computation of hypergeometric functions ( see appendix [ sec : appendixc ] ) . as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inbuilt routines to compute hypergeometric functions in commercial software packages such as matlab r2013a @xcite and mathematica 8 @xcite are not without limitations , so one should not rely on them in many parameter and variable regimes .",

    ". one can also exploit methods for computing @xmath51 and @xmath24 in conjunction with the above expressions .",
    "there are many useful applications of the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "for example , it has been used to find exact solutions of the wave equation @xcite , obtain insights on the scattering of charged particles @xcite , analyze gene frequency data @xcite , and investigate asian options in finance @xcite .",
    "the simplest method for computing the confluent hypergeometric function is to truncate the taylor series @xmath52 and then use the relation @xmath53 .",
    "a * stopping criterion * must be specified .",
    "it is common to stop computing terms when @xmath54 for some tolerance @xmath55 and some @xmath56 , and then return @xmath57 ( our approximation of @xmath2 ) as the solution @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can terminate computation of the series using the more stringent condition that two successive terms are small .",
    "we use this latter approach in our numerical experiments . by taking @xmath58",
    ", we obtain an accuracy of 15 decimal places ( if round - off error does not play a role ) .",
    "note that @xmath59 denotes `` machine epsilon '' in matlab .",
    "we choose this value for tol for all of the series computations in this paper .",
    "even the simple task of summing taylor series can be accomplished in different ways , and this can have a significant impact on stability and efficiency .",
    "we consider two methods for computing @xmath60 .",
    "compute @xmath61    the following three - term recurrence relation can be used to obtain approximations of @xmath32 recursively in terms of previous approximations @xcite : @xmath62 as one can see in table [ appbtable1 ] in appendix [ sec : appendixb ] , methods ( a ) and ( b ) generate similar results and require the same number of terms for most computations .",
    "however , as also illustrated by table [ appbtable1 ] , method ( b ) is in general more effective when carrying out computations involving small parameters .    by examining the coefficients of the series",
    ", we see that @xmath60 converges quickly when @xmath9 is close to zero or when @xmath7 has a large real part and a relatively small imaginary part ( because @xmath63 decays rapidly near the positive real axis ) ; again see table [ appbtable1 ] .",
    "however , as @xmath6 or @xmath9 becomes large , the coefficients of the taylor series become large , slowing down the convergence rate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3.3 ] ) . this can be seen in the fourth row in table [ appbtable1 ] , where the taylor series is accurate for up to and beyond @xmath64 ( although the approximation becomes less accurate as @xmath41 ) , depending on the parameter values involved .    as demonstrated by cases 1316 in table [ appbtable1 ] , a significant issue with computing @xmath4 using",
    "taylor series is cancellation .",
    "although @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the same in each of these cases , the taylor series method is effective in these cases if @xmath6 and @xmath9 have the same signs , whereas it is ineffective if their signs are different . in this situation , we find that the buchholz polynomial expansion that we describe in section [ sec:1f1_buchholz ] is more effective .",
    "( and hence @xmath4 ) for real @xmath67 $ ] when @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( red , dashed ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( green , solid ) , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( blue , dotted ) before the stopping criterion ( two successive small terms ) is satisfied .",
    "the method gives results to 15-digit accuracy .",
    ", width=321 ]    one could exploit sequence acceleration methods for computing the series . for example , in the nag library routine c06ba @xcite , shanks transformation @xcite is applied to the sequence using the @xmath74-algorithm in ref .",
    "@xcite .      as illustrated by the performance of taylor series method ( a ) on cases such as @xmath75 , where machine precision accuracy is not attained despite the apparent relative simplicity of the parameter regime",
    ", the methods of section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] can often have significant inaccuracies when the parameter values have small modulus , even though one might navely expect the computation to be fairly straightforward .",
    "the method that we discuss in this section aims to provide an alternative to those in section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] .",
    "it is also based on the basic series definition of the confluent hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind this method is that significant round - off error can arise when repeatedly dividing during the computation of individual terms of taylor series using other methods .",
    "therefore , applying a method that only requires a single division to compute an approximation to @xmath2 is potentially advantageous .    in this method",
    ", we express the series expansion of @xmath2 as a single fraction rather than as a sum of many fractions .",
    "for example , the sum @xmath76 of the first @xmath77 terms of the series up to the term in @xmath78 can be expressed as @xmath79 where the numerators and denominators of @xmath80 can be calculated using .",
    "if we take @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 and define @xmath76 to be the @xmath85th approximation of @xmath2 , we can apply the following algorithm :    @xmath86 implementing this method generates a sequence of approximations to @xmath2 ( i.e. , approximations of @xmath87 for @xmath88 ) , which we terminate using the same stopping criterion as in section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] .    from table",
    "[ appbtable1 ] , one can conclude that the methods of section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] generate accurate computations of @xmath2 more successfully than the methods previously discussed in this section , for a wide range of parameter and variable values .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that  especially as the moduli of the parameter values become increasingly large ",
    "the terms in the numerator and denominator of @xmath76 become very large for a relatively small @xmath85 , so numerical issues such as round - off error and cancellation may become significant when carrying out the computations .",
    "additionally , we often find that either the numerator or the denominator of @xmath76 becomes very large after only a few summations",
    ".    nevertheless , the method that we have just described is useful if @xmath89 is small ( especially when @xmath90 ) , provided @xmath91 is not too large .",
    "however , if one uses the taylor series methods of section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] when @xmath89 is small , then the round - off error can become costly if many terms are too large .",
    "therefore , a method with a single division can potentially aid accurate computation in this case , as the effect of round - off error is reduced .",
    "references @xcite used buchholz polynomials to derive expressions for @xmath32 , focusing on the regime of real parameters and variable .",
    "we find that this yields a much more effective approach than the methods discussed in sections [ sec:1f1_taylor ] and [ sec:1f1_singlefraction ] for the computation of @xmath32 when @xmath92 .",

    "( see appendix [ sec : appendixc ] for more details . )",
    "as illustrated in table [ appbtable1 ] , this method seems to outperform the taylor series methods of section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] for computation of @xmath4 for certain parameter regimes , and this is particular true for many examples in which @xmath105 . as illustrated by the first row of table [ appbtable1 ] , one problematic situation for this method occurs when @xmath106 .",
    "this results from the division by powers of @xmath107 in . in such cases",
    ", one can make use of recurrence relations , which we discuss in section [ sec:1f1_recurrences ] , or compute the taylor series directly .",
    "this method is valuable for moderate values of @xmath6 and @xmath9 ( in particular , for @xmath108 ) , especially when the real parts of @xmath6 and @xmath9 have opposite signs .",

    "one even obtains a very accurate result when @xmath91 is large ( e.g. , when @xmath109 ) , with real @xmath9 of opposite sign .",
    "( see case 19 in appendix [ sec : appendixa ] , for which we obtained 16-digit accuracy . )",
    "as illustrated in appendix [ sec : appendixb ] , however , this method becomes less successful as @xmath110 becomes larger .",
    "nonetheless , the good performance of this method for a large range of parameter values makes it a convenient element of one s toolbox for computing @xmath111 .      the methods that we outlined in sections [ sec:1f1_taylor ] and [ sec:1f1_buchholz ] were all ineffective ( in general ) for large values of @xmath110 .",

    "the expression when @xmath9 is real is given by @xcite @xmath123    we computed these series in matlab using the same two techniques as for the taylor series expansion in section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] . in the first method ,",
    "we compute each term by adding each new term recursively to the previous sum , where we continue including new terms until they become small , using the same stopping criteria as before . in the second method",
    ", we find each term iteratively in terms of the previous two terms and then add the new term to the previous sum . as in section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] , we label these techniques as methods ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we show our results in table [ appbtable1 ] .    as with the taylor series techniques of section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] , we obtain similar results using methods ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "both methods work well for large @xmath66 and moderate values of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "because the asymptotic series are expressed in terms of hypergeometric series of the form @xmath124 instead of @xmath51 ( or @xmath4 ) , there is no longer a @xmath125 term in the denominator of the terms of the series , so parameter regimes involving @xmath7 with large modulus can no longer be treated in a straightforward manner . as follows : @xmath126 ] the cases that we tested suggest that the methods cope reasonably well when neither @xmath91 nor @xmath89 is very large .",
    "( as a guide , the computations seem to lose accuracy when @xmath91 or @xmath89 is greater than 50 , although this depends on the value of @xmath9 .",
    "for these cases , one needs to apply recurrence relations ; see the discussion in section [ sec:1f1_recurrences ] @xcite . )",

    "indeed , we have @xmath207 thus the backward error is obtained by applying back - substitution to @xmath208 , which results in precisely the vector @xmath209^\\top.\\ ] ] thus we know convergence has occurred when @xmath210 this takes only @xmath196 operations to determine , versus the @xmath211 operations of back - substitution .",
    "the technique of using recurrence relations can be applied to compute @xmath13 effectively for parameter regimes for which previously described methods do not perform well .",
    "additionally , the ideas discussed in this section can be extended to compute recurrence relations with large @xmath154 @xcite . as discussed in section [ sec:1f1_summary ]",
    ", one can also apply these relations to successfully rephrase the problem of computing the confluent hypergeometric function as one involving larger values of parameters .",
    "note , however , that the minimal solutions involve gamma functions , so the effectiveness of the aforementioned technique is potentially restricted by issues with computing the gamma function of a variable with large modulus , unless great care is taken to counter this possibility when selecting the recurrence relation used .",
    "for example , in double - precision computations in the software package matlab , the number @xmath212 is stated as being infinite , even though it is actually finite .",
    "ideally , one would apply the technique of using recurrence relations to software in which gamma functions of modulus @xmath213 can be computed effectively .",
    "an alternative , which can be applied to any other method which requires the computation of a gamma function of large modulus , is to instead calculate the logarithm of each of the gamma functions involved ( as well as that of the hypergeometric function that we seek to compute ) and apply the relation @xmath214 .      a class of methods for computing @xmath32 or @xmath2 that can be useful for small @xmath110 is solving the * confluent hypergeometric differential equation * numerically .",
    "to do this , we express as a system of differential equations by writing @xmath215 , @xmath216 $ ] , with @xmath217 , @xmath218 , using the taylor series expansion to establish @xmath219 .",
    "we would then solve this system of first order ordinary differential equations numerically for @xmath220 and @xmath221 , with our approximation of @xmath2 being the numerical solution for @xmath220 .",
    "the code d02bj from the nag library , which contains an error - controlled adaptive runge - kutta method @xcite , is an effective means to do this .",
    "because of issues with computation time , however , this is only a valuable method for small @xmath66 , and we would certainly not recommend this approach when a ( much cheaper ) series method generates accurate solutions .",
    "many other methods have been developed to compute @xmath32 and @xmath2 .",
    "we mention several of them in passing ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for additional details .",
    "reference @xcite gives two additional series expansions for @xmath2 ; one expansion is in terms of beta random variables , and the other is in terms of the ( lower ) incomplete gamma function .",
    "reference @xcite gives an asymptotic expansion for large @xmath89 and @xmath110 , and ref .",
    "@xcite includes the derivation of a second hyperasymptotic expansion .",
    "the integral representation can also be computed using other methods , such as splitting the integral , romberg integration , and adaptive quadrature ( although the latter two require there to be no blow up of the integrand on either side of the region of integration ) .",
    "additional computational techniques include pad or rational approximations @xcite , a continued fraction expression @xcite ( techniques for solving such expressions are described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a chebyshev expansion for @xmath51 @xcite , or other expansions in terms of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "we note that considerable research has investigated how to compute the * whittaker function * , which is closely related to the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "techniques from such inquiries could perhaps be adapted for the computation of @xmath4 .",
    "details of methods for computing the whittaker function can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the methods that we have examined and implemented for the computation of @xmath32 include the series methods in sections [ sec:1f1_taylor ] , [ sec:1f1_buchholz ] , and [ sec:1f1_asymptotic ] ; the use of quadrature in section [ sec:1f1_quadrature ] ; recurrence relations in section [ sec:1f1_recurrences ] ) ; and various additional methods that are described in section [ sec:1f1_othermethods ] .",
    "the series methods seemed to generate the most accurate results , and they had very fast computation times in comparison to the inbuilt matlab function hypergeom .",
    "additionally , for values of @xmath91 and @xmath110 less than about 50 and @xmath222 , the taylor series methods described in section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] and the method of expressing @xmath51 as a single fraction in section [ sec:1f1_singlefraction ] typically seemed to be sufficiently robust ( with the restriction for the single - fraction method that @xmath90 ) .",
    "the method of gauss - jacobi quadrature is also effective for ` moderate ' values of @xmath91 , @xmath89 , and @xmath110 .",
    "one parameter regime in which the taylor series and single - fraction methods both fail when one might expect them to succeed is when @xmath91 and @xmath110 are roughly between 10 and 60 with real parts of opposite signs ( the problem arises from cancellation ) . in this case",
    ", the method involving buchholz polynomials discussed in section [ sec:1f1_buchholz ] can be very useful .",
    "one can do effective computations for large @xmath110another important case  by applying the asymptotic expansions of section [ sec:1f1_asymptotic ] .",
    "in section [ sec:1f1_asymptotic ] , we also discussed hyperasymptotics , which have exponentially - improved accuracy .",
    "their use can provide a viable alternative for the computation of @xmath4 for large @xmath110 in cases in which software with high precision and programs to compute the incomplete gamma function in the entire complex plane are available @xcite .",
    "if @xmath223 or @xmath224 , one can use the recurrence relations that we detailed in section [ sec:1f1_recurrences ] in order to compute hypergeometric functions with parameter values that have real parts of smaller absolute value .",
    "one then completes the computation in this new parameter regime using one of the methods discussed above .    when the parameters and variable are all real , the main problem that one faces is cancellation .",
    "for example , when computing a series representation of @xmath51 ( or @xmath4 ) in which positive and negative terms alternate , we find that the resulting error properties are likely to be poor .",
    "for instance , consider the computation of @xmath225 or @xmath226 .",
    "the sum of all of the positive taylor series terms for @xmath225 is the same as the absolute value of the sum of all of the negative terms ( roughly @xmath227 ) to 16 digits , whereas the value of @xmath225 is roughly @xmath228 .",
    "this problem may be circumvented by applying forward recurrences so that the values of @xmath7 in the eventual direct computation of @xmath4 are ( positive and ) large enough that the terms cancelling each other no longer have as large a magnitude .",
    "we have thereby devised an effective strategy for computing @xmath4 for real parameters and variables .",
    "we use the result @xcite @xmath229 and show our aggregate strategy in table [ 1f1recommendationsreal ] .",

    "[ appbtable2 ] , we present results that we obtained for computing @xmath5 ( or @xmath24 when @xmath8 is such that @xmath231 is infinite in finite precision ) using the two taylor series methods of section [ sec:1f1_taylor ] , the single - fraction method of section [ sec:2f1_singlefraction ] , the gauss - jacobi quadrature method of section [ sec:2f1_quadrature ] , and the analytic continuation formula of section [ sec:2f1_analyticcont ] .",
    "the label ` a ' in tables [ appbtable1 ] and [ appbtable2 ] indicates that the series method in consideration had not converged after the computation of @xmath232 terms .",
    "the label ` b ' indicates that the method was not effective because of overflow .",
    "the label ` c ' , which we use sometimes when we present a result from gauss - jacobi quadrature , indicates that the test case in question did not fall under the valid parameter regime for the method to be applicable .",
    "to provide a comprehensive survey of the available methods for computing @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we also need to consider the computation of other special functions that arise along the way .",
    "the most common such function is the gamma function , which is required for several of the methods to compute @xmath4 ( see sections [ sec:1f1_buchholz ] , [ sec:1f1_asymptotic ] , [ sec:1f1_quadrature ] , [ sec:1f1_recurrences ] , and [ sec:1f1_othermethods ] ) and @xmath5 ( see sections [ sec:2f1_quadrature ] , [ sec:2f1_unitdisc ] , [ sec:2f1_analyticcont ] , [ sec:2f1_largeparams_recurrences ] , [ sec:2f1_largeparams_uaes ] , and [ sec:2f1_othermethods ] ) .",
    "two other germane special functions are the incomplete gamma function , whose computation is necessary for the hyperasymptotic series in section [ sec:1f1_asymptotic ] , and the bessel function , whose computation is necessary for the buchholz polynomial method of section [ sec:1f1_buchholz ] and for the theory of uniform asymptotics .",
    "the psigamma , airy , and parabolic cylinder functions arise in the uniform asymptotic theory of section [ sec:2f1_largeparams_uaes ] .",
    "these special functions are discussed in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we note that the incomplete gamma and parabolic cylinder functions are themselves special cases of @xmath4 , the airy function is a special case of @xmath4 , and the bessel function is closely related to the * confluent hypergeometric limit function * @xmath233 @xcite . as follows : @xmath234 ]    the inbuilt matlab routines for computing special functions ( as of version r2013a ) are far from exhaustive ; there only exist routines for the gamma , bessel , incomplete gamma , and airy functions , and ( apart from the airy function ) these are restrictive in terms of the the parameter and variable values that can be used .",
    "we therefore needed to use other routines to compute these functions accurately and efficiently for various parameter regions .",
    "there is a inbuilt routine for computing the gamma function @xmath235 in matlab ( gamma ) , but it requires the argument @xmath9 to be real .",
    "the nag library @xcite , however , contains a routine ( s14ag ) to evaluate @xmath236 $ ] for any complex @xmath9 , and we used this for aspects of our work . if one wished to write his / her own routine for evaluating @xmath235 for @xmath35 , then for various values of @xmath9 one could use the lanczos expansion @xcite ( possibly using an expansion given by godfrey at @xcite ) , stirling expansions @xcite , spouge s method @xcite , or a talbot contour method @xcite . when @xmath237 , the transformation @xcite @xmath238 could be helpful when using the talbot contour method .",
    "matlab also has an inbuilt routine to compute the bessel function @xmath98 , but it is only applicable for real @xmath239 , so it would be useful to design a routine that can also be used for complex @xmath239 .",
    "such a routine could then be used to apply the methods in sections [ sec:1f1_buchholz ] and [ sec:2f1_largeparams_uaes ] . in constructing such a code",
    ", one might wish to take advantage of its taylor series , hankel asymptotic representation , integral relations @xcite , as well as work on practical computation of this function in @xcite , and we exploit these methods in our code .",
    "the ` upper ' and ` lower ' incomplete gamma functions @xmath240 and @xmath241 can be computed for any complex @xmath9 using the inbuilt matlab function gammainc , but this routine can only be applied for real @xmath242 .",
    "one would hence need to generalize this routine to implement the hyperasymptotic expansions detailed in section [ sec:1f1_asymptotic ] . to do this",
    ", one could exploit taylor series methods @xcite , asymptotic expansions @xcite , continued - fraction representations @xcite , recurrence relations @xcite , and the relation @xcite @xmath243 a computational procedure for the evaluation of @xmath240 and @xmath244 is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the parabolic cylinder function @xmath245 has yet to be implemented either in matlab or in the nag library .",
    "a routine for computing this function could exploit maclaurin series , asymptotic series , and recurrence relations @xcite ; solving the underlying differential equation numerically @xcite ; and other strategies @xcite .",
    "we also highlight articles which consider the practical computation of parabolic cylinder functions in @xcite . for the airy function @xmath246 and its derivative @xmath247 ( which are closely related to the bessel function @xcite ) and the psigamma function @xmath248",
