    "the connection between a stochastic model of particle reactions ( or equivalently , birth - death processes ) and its associated deterministic rate equations is a topic of continuing interest .",
    "the common intuition is that the rate equations are not only qualitatively correct , but indeed provide , when the number of interacting particles is large , a quantitatively accurate approximation .",
    "this intuition is given concrete support by the @xmath5 expansion of van kampen  @xcite .",
    "however , there are a number of situations in which this picture is too naive and needs to be refined .",
    "one by now classic example of this is the exponentially small rate of extinction for a system with an absorbing state  @xcite , which dominates the long - time dynamics , and is completely missed by the rate equations .",
    "another example is the anomalously large corrections  @xcite to the front velocity in stochastic systems which exhibit propagation into an unstable state ; e.g. , systems whose rate equation is the fisher - kolmogorov equation .    a system which captures features of both these examples is the spatially extended version  @xcite of the classic sis ( susceptible - infected - susceptible ) infection model of weiss and dishon  @xcite .",
    "in this model , contact ( either on - site or nearest - neighbor ) between an infected individual and a susceptible can , with some probability , convert the susceptible into an infected .",
    "infected individuals spontaneously leave the infected state , reverting to susceptible .",
    "the well - mixed sis system for sufficiently high infection probability possesses an endemic state , with a essentially constant level of infecteds , which however is subject to an exponentially small rate of extinction due to the existence of the absorbing state of zero infecteds .",
    "in addition , the deterministic rate equation is of fisher - kolmogorov type , and so a localized infection in the non - well - mixed case exhibits at the deterministic level an infection wave which propagates at constant velocity . however , the stochastic system exhibits not a bifurcation but rather a phase transition , characterized by the anomalous ( for dimension @xmath6 ) scaling exponents of the directed - percolation ( dp ) problem @xcite .",
    "the connection between this complicated statistical behavior and the deterministic rate equations , which should be valid in the large-@xmath0 limit ( @xmath0 being the total number of individuals , both susceptible and infected , on each site ) , is thus a natural topic for investigation , a study we initiated in a recent paper  @xcite ( i ) .",
    "there we found that in one spatial dimension , the large-@xmath0 behavior was governed by a scaling law with an exponent which we called @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the phase transition point was shifted from the deterministic bifurcation point by an amount proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "investigating the correlation length , @xmath8 , we found that there was a scaling collapse so that @xmath9 , with @xmath10 was a function of @xmath11 times the distance to the deterministic bifurcation point .    in this paper",
    ", we show that this behavior is in fact a nonequilibrium version of what one may call the ginzburg crossover . a fundamental concept in equilibrium field theory",
    "is that of the ginzburg criterion , which states under which circumstances the noise is relevant .",
    "this is of course what predicts the existence of an upper critical dimension ( ucd ) , above which the noise does not affect the long distance behavior and so the scaling is mean - field like .",
    "the logic underlying the ginzburg criterion implies that if one could  dial \" down the noise , the system would look more and more classical , and a crossover ( which we will call the ginzburg crossover ) between the classical and noise - dominated regimes should become apparent , with the noise dominating the very long distance behavior ( below the ucd , of course ) . this program has been implemented in the context of the equilibrium finite - range ising model , where spins interact with all their neighbors out to a distance @xmath12 . as @xmath12 increases , each spin is interacting with what is more and more closely approximating the mean - field , and mean - field behavior at short scales sets in .",
    "the problem can be carried out analytically for the finite - range spherical model  @xcite , and has been investigated via simulation in the finite - range ising model  @xcite .",
    "another fundamental epidemics model considered in i is the sir infection model of kermack and mckendrick  @xcite , where recovered individuals are immune to further infection .",
    "the critical behavior of this model is governed by the dynamic percolation exponents , with an upper critical dimension of 6 . in i",
    "we have carried a numerical investigation of the sir model also , showing that the theory converges , in the large @xmath0 limit , to its mean - field limit with scaling exponents @xmath4 and @xmath13 that differ from those of the sis ( dp ) model .",
    "here we consider again the sir model and derive analytically the relevant exponents using the same theory of the ginzburg crossover , applied to the different universality class of the sir model .",
    "the main quantity used in the theory of epidemics to characterize the transmission potential of a disease is the basic reproduction rate @xmath14 , which is the expected number of secondary cases produced by a primary case in a population that is completely susceptible @xcite . in the absence of demographic noise ( e.g. , in an infinite - dimensional model )",
    "the transition takes place at @xmath15 .",
    "noise shifts the transition to higher values of @xmath14 , but , as we will show below , the value @xmath16 still admits a special feature : the renormalized distance between @xmath15 and the actual transition point is @xmath0-independent as long as @xmath17 .",
    "this interesting feature allows one to examine the scaling properties numerically in a very efficient manner , as it saves the effort needed to identify the location of the transition point for each @xmath0 separately .",
    "this feature is utilized here when we compare the expected results with numerical simulations .",
    "we first review the well - mixed version of the sis model , and the relation of the stochastic model to the deterministic equations that determine the evolution of the system .",
    "although this stochastic model has already been analytically solved , the discussion allows us to present the concepts that we intend to use below and to set the mathematical framework used in the study of the spatial models .",
    "let us consider a population of exactly @xmath0 individuals , some of them are infected ( i ) and the rest are susceptible ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the allowed processes are infection ( with rate @xmath19 , this is the type ii model of @xcite ) and recovery ( with rate @xmath20 ) :    @xmath21    the corresponding master equation for the microscopic process can be formulated in terms of @xmath22 , the chance to have @xmath23 infected individuals : @xmath24.\\ ] ] defining @xmath25 as the expected number of infecteds , one finds after index rearrangement : @xmath26 the essence of the van kampen @xmath5 expansion is that this equation closes if @xmath27 , so that the variance of @xmath28 makes a negligible contribution , giving the standard logistic equation @xmath29 since @xmath30 , it is necessary for @xmath0 to be large , in order for the rate equation , eq .",
    "( [ mf1 ] ) , to be valid .",
    "this , however , is not sufficient .",
    "if @xmath31 , eq . ( [ mf1 ] ) has an attractive fixed point at @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the primary reproductive number and @xmath34 is indeed large if @xmath0 is large , as required .",
    "although the system admits an absorbing state at @xmath35 , the chance of a giant fluctuation that takes the system from @xmath34 to zero is exponentially small in @xmath34 , thus when @xmath36 stochastic extinction ( fadeout ) is impossible once the system reaches its steady state .",
    "however , if the number of infected individuals in the initial state is small , stochastic effects are transiently present even in the @xmath37 limit .",
    "for example , introducing one infected individual results in either short - time extinction ( with probability @xmath38 ) or an endemic state ( with probability @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 exactly , at the @xmath36 limit the system performs an unbiased random walk in @xmath23 , the number of infecteds , and the theory of first passage times tells us that the chance of extinction is still unity , but the probability @xmath41 to have @xmath42 infection events scales like @xmath43 .    at finite @xmath0",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "now the steady state of eq .",
    "( [ mf1 ] ) corresponds to a finite number of infected individuals in the endemic state , which mean that a finite , but large , fluctuation may cause a fadeout .",
    "the chance for such a fadeout is large when @xmath14 is close to one , i.e. , when the attractive fixed point corresponds to only a few individuals . instead of having a sharp extinction to proliferation transition at @xmath40 ,",
    "now the transition is  soft \" : defining @xmath44 as the distance from the transition , @xmath45 ; a metastable state exists only if this quantity ( the distance of the stable solution from the absorbing state ) is larger than the typical fluctuation size , @xmath46 , thus a transition _ zone _ of width @xmath47 occurs between the extinction and the proliferation regimes . as shown in @xcite , @xmath41 decays exponentially in the extinction phase @xmath48 , has a peak at @xmath49 at the endemic phase @xmath50 , and decays like @xmath43 with a cutoff at @xmath0 in the transition zone . note that the width of the transition zone goes to zero as @xmath0 approaches infinity , recovering the sharp transition at @xmath51 that characterizes the deterministic theory .",
    "the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ mf1 ] ) from eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) involves the neglect of @xmath52 terms .",
    "in particular one can easily see that the rate of infection when only one infected individual appears in a population of size @xmath0 is @xmath53 , so the transition occurs at @xmath54 .",
    "this result reflects the most trivial effect of discretization , namely , the absence of self - interactions @xcite : an infected individual can not infect itself , so the effective size of the population `` seen '' by the first infected is @xmath55 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "there are presumably other nonsingular @xmath56 corrections to the transition point , but for convenience we will refer to all these @xmath56 corrections as the  self - interaction \" effect .    putting this fact together with the discussion of the last section , we realize that there are two @xmath0 dependent functions that control the transition : one is the @xmath57 shift of the transition point , the other is the width of the `` quantum '' regime ( the region above the transition point in which the system is controlled by demographic fluctuations ) that scales , in the well - mixed limit , like @xmath58 . as @xmath36 the shift is negligible with respect to the width of the transition zone , so there is only one scale in the problem , @xmath59 .",
    "however this behavior is not generic . as we will show below , in some cases",
    "the width of the transition zone is much _ narrower _ than @xmath56 , and in these cases one should take into account the two scales .",
    "what happens if the system is extended ?",
    "for the sake of concreteness let us focus on the example of an infinite one dimensional array of patches with @xmath0 individuals on each patch .",
    "the probability per unit time of a susceptible on the @xmath23th site being infected by a given sick agent residing at this site is @xmath60 and of being infected by a given infected resident of one of the neighboring sites is @xmath61 ( in a @xmath62 dimensional system , this chance will be @xmath63 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the `` travelers model '' considered in ref .",
    "the deterministic rate , or mean - field ( mf ) , equations , are @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for the discrete version of the laplacian operator .",
    "the last , nonlinear diffusion , term , does not materially affect the dynamics ( naive dimensional analysis shows that it is an irrelevant operator ) . without this term one recognizes , on the mf level , the celebrated fisher ( or fkpp @xcite ) equation for invasion of a stable into an unstable phase , with a sharp transition at @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) , and front propagation with a velocity of @xmath68 , since the effective diffusion constant is @xmath69 and the net growth rate is @xmath70 .",
    "what happen when stochasticity is taken into account ?",
    "if @xmath71 , i.e. , there is only one agent on any site and so all infections are nearest - neighbor ( thus it is reasonable to take @xmath72 ) , the stochastic process is known as the contact process , which undergoes a continuous phase transition from extinction to proliferation .",
    "the  effective \" infection rate is smaller than @xmath73 , since a sick agent can not infect its neighbor if it is already sick .",
    "the transition happens at some @xmath74 , e.g. , here for @xmath71 , @xmath75 .",
    "while the exact value of @xmath76 is of course non - universal , the extinction transition , which belongs to the directed percolation equivalence class @xcite , admits three universal critical exponents :    1 .",
    "the spatial correlation length diverges as @xmath77 , where we introduce @xmath78 as the distance from the stochastic transition , as opposed to @xmath79 , which measures the distance to the _ mean - field _ transition ; in 1d , @xmath80 2 .",
    "the temporal correlation length diverges like @xmath81 ; in 1d , @xmath82 3 .   above the transition the steady state density of infecteds , @xmath34 ,",
    "grows like @xmath83 ; in 1d , @xmath84    the values of these critical exponents depend only on the dimensionality of the system and not on the microscopic details of the process . above the critical dimension @xmath85",
    "the exponents take their mf values , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "as @xmath0 ( the number of agents on a site ) increases , demographic fluctuations become smaller . in the infinite @xmath0 limit one",
    "recovers the mf transition described in eq .",
    "( [ mf2 ] ) .",
    "first , the transition point moves back to @xmath89 ; second , the values of the critical exponent in this deterministic limit are equal to their mf values . for example",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ mf2 ] ) that above the transition the density scales linearly with @xmath90 , i.e. , that @xmath91 . below the transition",

    "the maximal density at @xmath94 occurs when @xmath95 ; thus the spatial profile of _ total _ infections is proportional to @xmath96 with @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 .    at any finite @xmath0 , though , close enough to @xmath76 the system is controlled by stochastic effects , as implied by universality",
    ". as @xmath0 becomes large , the effects of stochasticity are restricted to a narrow region close to the transition point , which defines the width of the transition (  quantum \" ) zone .    in i",

    "the values @xmath7 and @xmath101 have been obtained numerically for different microscopic models that belongs to the dp equivalence class and seem to be identical for the different models up to the accuracy of the numerics . as long as @xmath102 , the region in the parameter space in which the system is controlled by stochasticity coincides with the interval between the stochastic and the deterministic critical points ; i.e. , it also scales like @xmath1 .",
    "rescaling appropriately the correlation length and the distance from the transition , our numerics ( see i ) showed an whole scaling regime described by the function : @xmath103 the scaling function @xmath104 vanishes linearly at a positive value of its argument , which marks the transition point .",
    "notice that what enters here is @xmath105 , so that the behavior at the classical transition point is controlled by the fluctuations , even though it is outside the range of the linear behavior of @xmath106 .",
    "we will see later that the story is more complicated for @xmath107 .    as discussed in the introduction , this scaling behavior is the result of a crossover between the deterministic theory and the critical theory as the critical point is neared .",
    "we will now use this to derive a scaling relation between @xmath13 and @xmath4 .",
    "then we will obtain the value of @xmath4 by calculating the ginzburg criterion for the model .    to connect @xmath13 to @xmath4",

    "instead , we can choose to simulate exactly at @xmath16 , which in our case implies @xmath16 .",

    "one is tempted , then , to write , in analogy with our other scaling laws , @xmath266 .",
    "the problem with this is that , while in the continuum classical limit , the velocity is proportional to @xmath267 , on the lattice this is true only for small @xmath79 . to work with discrete agents and to define their local density",
    "one should implement some uv cutoff , so even for off - lattice models the relevant result is the one obtained for a lattice .",

    "along this paper we have studied , numerically and analytically , the convergence of the stochastic process to the deterministic rate equations when the number of particles is large . in spatially extended model",
    "there are two parameters that control the convergence : the number of particles per site @xmath0 and the distance from the transition point .",
    "together , these parameters yield a region of size @xmath283 above the phase transition point ; within this region the system is dominated by demographic noise and the deterministic equations fail to describe it accurately .",
    "the value of @xmath4 has been found before using an extensive analysis of zero dimensional @xcite and one dimensional @xcite models .",
    "it turns out that this particular result may be derived directly , for any dimensionality , using the ginzburg analysis . for the fundamental models considered here",
    "it depends only on the difference between @xmath3 , the upper critical dimension , and @xmath62 , via @xmath284 .",
    "clearly , this general expression stems from the fact that the leading perturbative correction ( i.e. , the diagrams that lead to an infrared divergence in the highest dimension , which is thus the upper critical dimension ) is proportional to @xmath56 , since it involves an average over two noise terms , each is proportional to @xmath285 .",
    "this seems to be a generic property of stochastic processes and will be interesting to find out a model for which this general argument is not applicable .    below @xmath286 @xmath102 , and",
    "the self - interaction shift is negligible at large @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the point @xmath16 is peculiar : its normalized distance from the critical point ( the distance divided by the width of the quantum regime ) is @xmath0 independent .",
    "accordingly , the divergence of various observables at this point is determined solely by @xmath11 .",
    "this feature facilitates the numerics , since one can extract the value of the exponent without finding @xmath76 . if @xmath287 this is no longer the case , and to locate the quantum regime one has to first identify the transition point .",
    "although the sis and sir processes serves us here as an archetypic stochastic processes that belong to the most pronounced equivalence classes of out - of - equilibrium transitions , they are also interesting models for epidemiologists .",
    "several attempts have been made , recently , in order to understand better the role of fluctuations in individual - based , spatially structured epidemic models .",
    "the results presented here practically solve this problem for the case of subpopulations on a lattice considered in @xcite .",
    "in the common case of zoonotic infections the pathogens first emerged from animal reservoirs , inducing a `` stuttering transmission '' stage in which @xmath288 , and reaching the phase of sustained transmission ( human outbreak ) only due to pathogen evolution ( in human environment ) to @xmath289 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath14 is growing slowly to larger value ( as opposed to a major evolutionary step caused by a single mutation ) the pathogen must cross the quantum region , where the size of the outbreak ( the number of infections , and hance the chance for the next evolutionary step to occur ) is simply @xmath290 . with an appropriate knowledge about the adaptation process of the pathogen",
    ", it will be quite easy to implement our results to obtain the chance of an outbreak .",
    "the authors thank prof .",
    "pierre hohenberg for pointing out the work of mon and binder on the mf limit of equilibrium systems .",
    "here we show some elements of the perturbative expansion of the action ( [ action ] , [ s1 ] ) and the terms that determine the leading correction for large @xmath0 , as explained in the text .",
    "the elementary diagrams that appear in the perturbative expansion are shown in the upper part of fig .",

    "appear in the reggeon field theory and yield the one - loop renormalization of the mass and @xmath14 .",
    "the diagrams involved are presented in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .      with the bare propagator , eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) , one can see that the leading correction to the mass behaves like @xmath292 this implies that @xmath42 scales like @xmath293 and hence close to the transition the result is proportional to @xmath294 , thus from this diagram one would get @xmath295 ( @xmath296 , see text ) . the triangular diagram that provides the correction to the coupling constant scales like @xmath297 so it corresponds to @xmath298 .",
    "however , the corrections to the diffusion constant are given by the second derivative of the self - energy diagram with respect to the incoming momentum , and this contribution is proportional to @xmath299 and this term yields the minimum value @xmath300 given in eq .",
