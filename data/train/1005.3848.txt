    "a thorough and tractable understanding of early universe physics through an ultraviolet ( uv ) complete description , such as string theory , remains out of our reach for now .",
    "while we do not completely understand the precise features of the uv completion of the standard model coupled to gravity , or even the gross structure of such a putative theory , one of its likely generic consequences is the presence of a large number of scalar fields and possibly a large number of vacua .",
    "the masses of these fields are typically associated with the internal structure of the theory , for example , the cutoff scale of the effective action which encapsulates the uv relevant physics that completes our theory .",
    "however , in general it might be that different fields have different mass scales associated with them such that a hierarchy appears in the field content , and we can colloquially speak of ` light ' and ` heavy ' modes .",
    "usually , the heavy fields are assumed to be integrated out since they are kinematically inaccessible provided that their masses are larger than the scale of physics of interest .",
    "however in reality , we can not completely ignore the heavy fields as the conditions underlying the decoupling theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite can sometimes be relaxed , for instance through time dependence in the heavy sector , or through dynamical mixing of heavy and light sectors . in the context of field theories at a point in field space ,",
    "gauge symmetry breaking can lead to a non - decoupling scenario ( see  @xcite , and references therein , for a recent example ) . in the context of supergravity , decoupling of heavy fields",
    "is still actively being studied  @xcite .        in a series of papers",
    ", this collaboration will examine the conditions under which decoupling is relaxed , or fails outright , and explore quantitatively the consequences of this failure .",
    "the subject of this paper is to study multi - scalar field theories in minkowski spacetimes characterized by having a hierarchy of scales between different families of fields .",
    "our main goal is to characterize the interaction between light and heavy degrees of freedom as the background expectation value of the scalar fields ( which we assume to be spatially homogeneous ) varies in time , traversing a curved trajectory in field space .",
    "specifically , we analyze those situations where the heavy degrees of freedom correspond to the transverse modes with respect to the path followed by the background fields . pictorially , these curved trajectories are placed in the nearly flat valleys of the vacuum manifold .",
    "an example of such a curved trajectory is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curved_traj ] where a scalar potential presents a curved flat direction with a massive mode remaining perpendicular to it .",
    "such curvature mixes light and heavy directions along the field trajectory , possibly non - adiabatically if the field space is ` curved ' enough . in the context of inflation ,",
    "the effects studied in this work lead to potentially observable effects in the spectrum of primordial perturbations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the case of two - field models",
    ", we will show that whenever the trajectory makes a turn in field space such that the light direction is interchanged by a heavy direction ( and vice versa ) , the low energy effective action describing the dynamics of the light degrees of freedom generically picks up a non - trivial correction , hereby parameterized by @xmath0 and given by = ( 1 + ) , where @xmath1 is the velocity of the background scalar field , @xmath2 is the radius of curvature characterizing the bending of the trajectory in field space , and @xmath3 is the characteristic mass scale of the heavy modes .",
    "we emphasize that the bending is measured with respect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric , whether or not it is canonical ; notice that @xmath2 represents a distance measured in the geometrical space of scalar fields , and therefore it has units of mass .",
    "more precisely , at low energies ( @xmath4 ) the equation of motion describing the scalar field fluctuation _",
    "parallel _ to the trajectory of background fields is found to be [ effective - eq ] - e^- ^2 + m^2_l = 0 , with @xmath5 being the spatial laplacian : see ( [ low - energy - eff - action ] ) .",
    "thus the kinetic energy term is modified by a factor of @xmath6 in front of the spatial gradient term , in agreement with @xcite . in the context of inflation",
    ", this can give rise to sizable effects that may be observable in the next generation of the cosmic microwave background observations .",
    "for example , for inflation in supergravity models , the masses of heavy degrees of freedom during inflation are typically of order @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "this leads to the naive expectation e^~1 + , where @xmath9 is the so - called slow - roll parameter . then",
    ", if the bending of the trajectory is such that the radius of curvature @xmath2 becomes much smaller than @xmath10 one then is led to @xmath11 .",
    "such a situation implies strong modifications on the scale dependence of inflaton fluctuations , contributing non - trivial features to the power spectrum well within the threshold of detection .",
    "the full analysis valid for inflationary cosmology is , however , more involved than the naive arguments above as it requires a detailed account of gravity and careful treatments of the multi - field dynamics at horizon crossing .",
    "for this reason , in the present note we study the basic features of the effects of the heavy - light field interactions during turns of the scalar field trajectory in a minkowski background , and leave the study of inflationary de sitter case for a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "we stress here that the perspective that follows from our analysis is that the only relevant criteria for the effects we uncover ( such as the modified speed of sound for the perturbations ) is that our system deviates sufficiently from a geodesic trajectory .",
    "our formalism , and its application to inflation @xcite builds upon previous work @xcite that we extend to be able to account for the effects coming from very sharp turns and also prolonged turns in which the true ground state deviates significantly from its single - field approximation . by disregarding the effects of gravity ,",
    "we are able to describe in detail the evolution of the quantum modes in some idealized settings ( e.g. turns at a constant rate ) .",
    "we also extend recent results by @xcite , that we recover in the right limits .",
    "in particular , we are able to clarify the relevance or otherwise of non - canonical kinetic terms , in particular with respect to a reduced speed of sound in the effective low energy theory ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we expect our results to be relevant for any phenomena where the variation of vacuum expectation values plays a significant role , such us inflation , phase transitions , soliton interactions and soliton - radiation scattering .    in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will first elaborate on the general framework and study the background equations of motion in section  [ sec : background ] . in section  [ pert - quant ]",
    ", we will study the theory of perturbations and the quantization around a general field trajectory . in section  [ hierarchies ] , we will apply the theory to the case of a large hierarchy between light and heavy degrees of freedom that span a curved field space trajectory . to conclude",
    ", we will discuss some applications in section  [ conclusions ] , in particular regarding inflation and the decoupling of heavy modes in supergravity .",
    "some calculational details are provided in the appendices .",
    "we are interested in multi - scalar field theories admitting a low energy effective action consisting of at most two space - time derivatives .",
    "examples of such theories are low energy compactifications of string theory and supergravity models , where the number of scalar degrees of freedom ( often referred to as moduli ) can be considerably large . for an arbitrary number @xmath12 of scalar fields in a minkowski background , the effective action of such a theory may be written in the form [ initial - action ] s= - d^4x , where @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , is a set of scalar fields and @xmath15 is an arbitrary symmetric matrix restricted to be positive definite .",
    "any contribution to this action containing higher space - time derivatives will be suppressed by some cutoff energy scale @xmath16 , which we assume to be much larger than the energy scale of our interest . in low energy string compactifications",
    ", such a scale @xmath16 corresponds to the compactification scale , which may be close to @xmath10 .",
    "however , as mentioned before , we do not consider coupling this theory to gravity , saving this for a separate report  @xcite .    in order to study the dynamics of the present system",
    "it is useful to think of @xmath17 as a metric tensor of some abstract scalar manifold @xmath18 of dimension @xmath12 .",
    "this allows us to consider the definition of several standard geometrical quantities related to @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , the christoffel connections are given by ^a_b c = ^a d ( _ b _ d c + _ c _ b d - _ d _ b c ) , where @xmath19 is the inverse metric satisfying @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes a partial derivative with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "this allows us to define covariant derivatives in the usual way as @xmath22 .",
    "also , we may define the associated riemann tensor as ^a_b c d _",
    "c ^a_b d - _ d",
    "^a_b c + ^a_c e ^e_d b - ^a_d e ^e_c b .",
    "[ riemann - def ] as well as the ricci tensor @xmath23 and the ricci scalar @xmath24 .",
    "we should keep in mind that , typically , there will be an energy scale @xmath25 associated with the curvature of @xmath18 , fixing the typical mass scale of the ricci scalar as @xmath26 . in many concrete situations",
    "the scale @xmath25 corresponds precisely to the aforementioned cutoff scale @xmath16 .",
    "for example , in @xmath27 supergravity realizations of string compactifications , one typically finds that the ricci scalar of the khler manifold satisfies @xmath28  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we assume @xmath29 and do not distinguish them .    given these geometric quantities , we can write the background equation of motion of the homogeneous background fields @xmath30 from the action ( [ initial - action ] ) .",
    "if @xmath31 , one may think of @xmath32 as the coordinates parametrizing a trajectory in @xmath18 , where @xmath33 is the parameter on the curve describing the expectation value of the scalar fields . before proceeding with a detailed analysis of these trajectories ,",
    "let us emphazise that these trajectories may or may not be the geodesics of @xmath18 , with the details depending on the specific form of the scalar potential @xmath34 and the geometry of @xmath18 . varying the action ( [ initial - action ] ) with respect to @xmath13 , the equations of motion of @xmath13",
    "are then found to be [ scal - eq-1 ] _ 0^a + v^a = 0 , where we have introduced the notation @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "given a certain scalar manifold @xmath18 and a scalar potential @xmath37 , these equations can be solved to obtain the trajectory in @xmath18 traversed by the background scalar fields . it is convenient to define the rate of variation of the scalar fields @xmath1 along the trajectory as _ 0 ^ 2 _ a b _ 0^a _ 0^b . since @xmath17 is positive definite , @xmath38 is always greater than or equal to zero . without loss of generality , in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath39 for all @xmath33 .",
    "then the unit tangent vector @xmath40 to the trajectory is defined as t^a , [ def - t ] and if the trajectory is curved we can define one of the normal vectors to be n^a s_n ( t ) ( _ bc ) ^-1/2 , [ def - n ] where @xmath41 denotes the orientation of @xmath42 with respect to the vector @xmath43 . that is , if @xmath44 then @xmath42 is pointing in the same direction as @xmath43 , whereas if @xmath45 then @xmath42 is pointing in the opposite direction .",
    "due to the presence of the square root , it is clear that @xmath42 is only well defined at intervals where @xmath46 .",
    "however , since @xmath47 may become zero at finite values of @xmath33 , we allow @xmath48 to flip signs each time this happens in such a way that both @xmath42 and @xmath49 remain a continuous function of @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that the sign of @xmath50 may be chosen conventionally at some initial time @xmath51 , but from then on it is subject to the equations of motion respected by the background   are analytic functions of time , and therefore we disregard any situation where this procedure can not be performed . ] . as we shall see later , in the particular case where @xmath18 is two dimensional ,",
    "the presence of @xmath52 in ( [ def - n ] ) is sufficient for @xmath42 to have a fixed orientation with respect to @xmath40 ( either left - handed or right - handed ) .    after some formal manipulations , we can deduce @xmath2 , the radius of curvature of the trajectory followed by the vacuum expectation value @xmath32 , as [ kappa - def ] = , where @xmath53 .",
    "details of how ( [ kappa - def ] ) is derived can be found in appendix  [ sec : app - geom ] .",
    "notice that for @xmath54 , the only way of having @xmath55 is by following a straight curve for which there is no geodesic deviation , @xmath56 .",
    "this result follows the basic intuition that , during a turn in the trajectory , the scalar fields will shift from the minimum of the potential @xmath55 along the perpendicular direction @xmath42 .",
    "trajectories for which @xmath55 are in fact geodesics , and therefore the parameter @xmath2 is a useful measure of the geodesic deviation caused by the potential @xmath37 . on dimensional grounds , we should expect @xmath57 , as the intrinsic curvature of the manifold @xmath58 is the result of the embedding in a yet higher energy completion , and this likely bestows this manifold with a similar extrinsic curvature scale .",
    "this extrinsic curvature is then necessarily the minimal extrinsic curvature for any trajectory on @xmath58 . yet , much more curved trajectories are perfectly possible   invariant potential , used to break the electroweak symmetry of the standard model , have a radius of curvature of order @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the higgs mass . ] and we therefore allow a wider range of values for @xmath2 .",
    "we now study the evolution of the scalar field fluctuations around the background time - dependent solution examined in the previous section . we extend the formalism of @xcite to be able to deal with regimes of fast and or continuous turns . as we shall see , the radius of curvature @xmath2 couples the perturbations parallel and normal to the motion of the background fields .",
    "let us start by writing @xmath13 including perturbations @xmath61 as [ perturbations - def ] ^a ( t , * x*)= _ 0^a(t ) + ^a(t , * x * ) , where @xmath32 corresponds to the exact solution to the homogeneous equation of motion ( [ scal - eq-1 ] ) .",
    "starting from the action ( [ initial - action ] ) , one finds the equations of motion for @xmath62 as [ pert - eq-1 ] - ^2 ^a + c^a_b ^b = 0 , where c^a_b = _",
    "b v^a - _ 0 ^ 2 ^a _ c d b t^c t^d .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite these equations in terms of a new set of perturbations orthogonal to each other . for this",
    "we define a complete set of vielbeins @xmath63 and work with redefined fields [ perturbations - def-2 ] v^i = e^i_a ^a .",
    "an example of a possible choice for these vielbeins is a set @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 among its elements @xcite , but we do not consider this choice until later . recall that the vielbeins satisfy the basic relations @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which lead to e^i_a e^a_j & = & - e^a_j e^i_a , + e^a_i e_b^i & = & - e_b^i e_i^a . in ( [ perturbations - def-2 ] )",

    "one can verify that this derivative is compatible with the kronecker delta in the sense that @xmath77 .",

    "[ conclusions ] in this note , we considered the structure of low energy description of scalar field theories with a pronounced hierarchy of mass scales . first , we set up a framework for describing a light field moving along a multi - field trajectory in field space . from this , we determined the background equations of motion , around which we can study perturbations . finally , we deduced the effective theory describing light perturbations for the case in which the background field is following a curved trajectory in field space .",
    "the main manifestation of the non - trivial mixing of the heavy and the light directions is in the appearance of the coefficient @xmath6 in front of the term @xmath210 containing spatial derivatives in the action ( [ low - energy - eff - action ] ) .",
    "first , since @xmath211 , the net effect of the bending of the background trajectory is to reduce the energy per scalar field quantum .",
    "this is due to the fact that during bending the light modes momentarily start exciting heavy modes , therefore transferring energy to them .",
    "second , since @xmath212 , there are two effects competing against each other in this process",
    ". on one hand one has @xmath213 , or alternatively @xmath214 , which may be interpreted as the angular speed of the background field along the curved trajectory . on the other hand ,",
    "there is the mass of the heavy mode @xmath58 , which must be excited by the light modes during the bending .",
    "we stress that the magnitude of the effect is parametrized entirely by the parameter @xmath0 , which depends on the velocity of the background trajectory and the induced curvature along the scalar field trajectory through the field manifold , parametrized by @xmath2 . whether the kinetic terms are canonical or not is immaterial as this is merely a question of the chosen basis in field space .",
    "in what follows we discuss two direct applications of our results : inflation and the non - decoupling of light and heavy modes in supergravity .",
    "understanding in detail how light and heavy modes remain coupled under more general circumstances could be particularly significant for cosmic inflation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , although current observations are consistent with the simplest model of single field inflation , it is rather hard to conceive a realistic model where the inflaton field alone is completely decoupled from uv degrees of freedom .",
    "one way of addressing this issue is by studying multi - field scenarios where many scalar fields have the chance to participate in the inflationary dynamics  @xcite , despite of different mass scales among the inflaton candidates .",
    "hence , there could exist certain phenomena related to inflation in which the effects studied in this report can be relevant .",
    "this has also recently been considered in refs .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "first , note that the equation of motion deduced from the action ( [ low - energy - eff - action ] ) is given by + e^- k^2 + m^2_l = 0 .",
    "[ effective - eq-2 ] for definiteness , let us focus on phenomena characterized by @xmath215 and consider the case in which the potential is flat enough so that @xmath216 is satisfied .",
    "then , the time variation of @xmath0 along the trajectory is small enough to allow us to write the mode solution as ( k , t ) = , [ sol - beta ] where the factor @xmath217 is necessary in order to satisfy the commutation relation @xmath218 = i$ ] .",
    "this factor coincides with the one found in ( [ expansion - v-1 ] ) for the amplitude of light modes in the case where @xmath0 is a constant . to continue , from ( [ sol - beta ] ) we can see that in the vacuum , the two point correlation function of the perturbation @xmath219 , has the form @xmath220",
    ". one direct consequence of this result is for inflation , where the amplitudes of scalar fluctuations freeze after crossing the horizon , i.e. when the physical wavelength @xmath221 satisfies the condition @xmath222 .",
    "more precisely , if we generalize ( [ effective - eq-2 ] ) to include gravity , we would conclude that the speed of sound of adiabatic perturbations is given by c_s^2 = e^- .",
    "such an effect is known to produce sizable levels of non - gaussianities  @xcite .",
    "additionally it modifies the power spectrum as p(k ) e^(k ) / 2 p_*(k ) , [ power - beta-2 ] where @xmath223 is the conventional power spectrum @xmath224 deduced in single field slow - roll inflation , and @xmath225 is the value of @xmath226 at the time @xmath33 when the mode @xmath129 crosses the horizon  , @xmath227 is constant as well and we find an overall modulation of the power spectrum compatible with ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . certainly the more interesting case corresponds to a varying @xmath0 , and since @xmath0 can be large , such an effect may be sizable and observable in the near future .",
    "in many scalar field theories , such as supergravity , the masses of heavy degrees of freedom during inflation are typically of order @xmath228 , leading to the relation e^~1 + 4 . if the bending is such that @xmath229 ( a feasible situation ) one then could obtains effects as large as @xmath230 . in the case where a turn of the trajectory happens during a few @xmath231-folds ,",
    "one then should be able to observe features in the power spectrum of @xmath232 , particularly by modifying the running of the spectral index as @xmath233 , which otherwise would be of @xmath234 .",
    "a detailed computation of this effect can be found in  @xcite , where the interaction between light an heavy modes during horizon crossing is examined more closely ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our results can be also used to assess when a low energy effective theory , deduced from a multi - scalar field theory containing both heavy directions and light directions , is accurate enough .",
    "as discussed in full detail in appendix [ appendix - zero - order ] , whenever the background fields are evolving ( as in inflation ) the only way of having a vanishing @xmath0-parameter is for a trajectory to correspond to a geodesic in the full scalar field manifold @xmath148 .",
    "it is clear that the only way of achieving this is by having some property relating the shape of the potential @xmath34 with the geometry of @xmath18 . in the particular case of supergravity",
    "such a property is known to exist , and therefore one should expect supergravity theories rendering low energy effective theories for which @xmath0 vanishes exactly . to be more precise , in @xmath27 supergravity",
    "the scalar field potential is given by v = e^g ( ^a |b g_a g_|b - 3 )  , where @xmath235 is the inverse of the khler metric @xmath236 deduced out of the generalized khler potential @xmath237 , which is a real function of the chiral scalar fields @xmath13 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "now , consider a supergravity theory in which a set of massive chiral fields @xmath240 satisfy the condition g_h = 0  , along a given hypersurface @xmath241 in @xmath18 parametrized _ only _ by the light fields @xmath242 .",
    "this means that a surface @xmath89 is defined by @xmath243 rather that by a function @xmath244  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "then it is possible to verify that the scalar fluctuations @xmath245 parallel to @xmath241 are decoupled from the fields @xmath240 , rendering @xmath246 . to appreciate this , observe first that at any point on the surface @xmath241 the khler metric @xmath247 is diagonal between the two sectors .",
    "indeed , since @xmath248 holds at any point in the surface , then it must be independent of arbitrary displacements @xmath249 along @xmath241 .",
    "this implies that _",
    "g_h = _ h |l = 0 s. this condition automatically ensures that in the absence of a scalar field potential , the trajectory along @xmath241 will be a geodesic .",
    "it remains then to verify that the potential does not imply quadratic couplings between both sectors , and therefore leaves these geodesic trajectories unmodified .",

    "it is not difficult to notice that also @xmath253 which also hinge on @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",

    "conversely , deviations from the condition @xmath254 , or a surface @xmath89 with @xmath255 , will produce interactions leading to the appearance of the coupling @xmath0 studied in the present work .",

    "let us review under what conditions the previous truncation is consistent .",
    "for this , let us recall how much a solution to ( [ eq - for - light - trunc ] ) deviates from the equation of motion of the full theory given by ( [ scal - eq-1 ] ) . by differentiating with respect to time the solution  ( [ min - sol ] ) with @xmath296 satisfying ( [ eq - for - light - trunc ] ) we find _ * ^a ( ) & = & x^a _",
    "^ ^ , or alternatively : _ * ^a ( ) & = & ( m^a _ - x^a",

    "[ non - geo ] it is useful to define @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is the projector along the space perpendicular to the surface .",
    "@xmath305 transforms as a tensor : q^a _ = _ x^a _ + ^a_b x^b_- ^ _ x^a _ = d _ x^a _ , where @xmath306 .",
    "the previous notation is consistent as @xmath307 transforms homogeneously under reparametrizations of @xmath308 and @xmath199 .",
    "thus , finally we are left with _ * ^a ( ) = q^a _ ^ ^ .",
    "[ non - geo-2 ] therefore , since @xmath309 by definition , if @xmath310 is non - vanishing along the trajectory followed by @xmath311 , then @xmath312 does not satisfy the equations of motion for @xmath13 in the full theory .",
    "in fact , we are interested in an arbitrary solution @xmath313 of ( [ eq - for - light - trunc ] ) , thus in general , either @xmath314 or @xmath315 .",
    "the first case corresponds to a stationary solution , where the background is not evolving .",
    "the second case @xmath315 is more interesting , as it corresponds to the case in which @xmath292 is geodesically generated . to appreciate this ,",
    "notice first that if @xmath315 then @xmath316 satisfies the equation of a geodesic . in second place , it is possible to deduce the following identity ^a _ & & p^a_b x^c _ x^d _ x^e _ ^b _ c d e + & = & p^a_b ( d_q^b _ - d_q^b _ ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath315 then arbitrary vectors , which are tangent to @xmath292 , will not generate a component normal to @xmath292 after being transported around an arbitrary loop in @xmath292 .",
    "finally , one also has the general relation ^ _ & = & x_a^ x^b _ x^c _ x^d _ ^a _ b c d + & & + ( q^a _ _ a b q^b _ g^ - q^a _ _ a b q^b _ g^ ) , meaning that if @xmath315 one has that the riemann tensor @xmath317 characterizing @xmath292 coincides with the induced riemann tensor @xmath318 to the surface .",
    "it is rather clear that whenever the surface @xmath292 is not geodesically generated , the solution @xmath319 is not a solution of the full set of equations of motion .",
    "let us now ask under what circumstances this might be a good approximation .",
    "for this , consider the following notation for the full solution ^a = ^a _ * + ^a , where @xmath320 has the purpose of parametrizing the displacement of the full solution from @xmath321 defining the surface @xmath292 ( see figure [ fig : ex_traj ] ) .      to deduce the equation of motion for @xmath320 notice that & = & ^a + ^a_b c ( ) ^b ^c + & = & ^a _ * + ^a + ^a_b c ( _ * + ) ( _ * + ) ^b ( _ * + ) ^c + & = & + ^a + ^a_b c ( _ * ) ^b _",
    "* ^c + ^a_b c ( _ * ) _ * ^b ^c + & & + _ d ^a_b c ( _ * ) _ * ^b _ * ^c ^d , where we kept terms up to order @xmath322 . on the other hand , we have the relation & = & + & & + _ b c^a ( _ * ) _ * ^c .",
    "putting these two expressions together we find the equation of motion for @xmath320 to be given by + q^a _",
    "^^+ c^a _ b ( _ * ) ^b = 0 , [ eq - delta ] where we are neglecting terms of higher order in @xmath322 . in the previous expression",
    "we have defined c^a _ b ( _ * ) v^a _ b ( _ * ) - ^a _ c d b ( _ * ) _ * ^c _ * ^d , where @xmath323 . in deriving this expression",
    "we have assumed that @xmath324 is of @xmath325 .",
    "this is correct since we need to demand @xmath326 for the particular case @xmath327 .",
    "that is to say , we are strictly interested in the inhomogeneous solution of the previous equation ( we shall later address the issue regarding perturbations ) .",
    "notice that the effective mass @xmath328 contains a contribution from the riemann tensor .",
    "however , the direction given by @xmath329 continues to be a flat direction since @xmath330 . in other words ,",
    "c^a _ b ( _ * ) _ * ^b = 0 .",
    "additionally , notice that @xmath331 is symmetric . to proceed , let us define a few more quantities .",
    "first , the tangent vector to the trajectory defined by @xmath332 on the surface is given by t_*^a = , where @xmath333 .",
    "in fact , notice that t_*^a & = & x^a _ t_*^ , + t_*^ & = & , + _ * ^2 & = & g _ ^^ .",
    "it is a simple matter to show that & = & _ * q^a _ t_*^t_*^ , + _ * & = & 0 .",
    "it follows that @xmath334 .",
    "it should be clear that @xmath335 , as @xmath336 is by definition along the flat directions of the potential .",
    "it is useful to consider the definition of the radius of curvature @xmath337 parametrizing the deviation of the trajectory in @xmath292 with respect to geodesics in @xmath18 .",
    "the radius of curvature @xmath337 comes defined as = s_n(t ) , and therefore one has = | n_*a q^a _ t_*^t_*^| = .",
    "notice that this quantity depends only on geometrical objects , as it should .",
    "coming back to ( [ eq - delta ] ) , we may now write - s_n(t ) _ * ^2 n_*^a _ * ^-1 + c^a _ b ( _ * ) ^b = 0  . at this point",
    "one may argue that there are no good reasons to consider @xmath338 to be a small parameter .",
    "in fact , typically , for theories incorporating modular fields , @xmath2 may be of @xmath232 in planck unit or even smaller . since @xmath339 is constant , it is convenient to parametrize the trajectory with @xmath340 .",
    "we can in fact write & = & _ * , + & = & _ * ^2 .",
    "we can therefore reexpress the equation of motion for @xmath320 in terms of the proper parameter @xmath340 along the curve + c^a _ b ( _ * ) ^b = s_n ( _ * ) n_*^a _ * ^-1 , [ eq - delta-2 ] where now @xmath341 denotes the sign of @xmath342 relative to @xmath343 but expressed as a function of @xmath340 instead of time . to gain experience with this equation ,",
    "consider the following situation .",
    "suppose we have a trajectory in field space characterized by a constant curvature @xmath2 and such that @xmath344 with @xmath345 a constant .",
    "that is , @xmath42 is an eigenvector of @xmath346 . under such conditions , using the results of section  [ sec : background ] we find that = - .",
    "then , we can see that @xmath347 with @xmath322 constant is a solution of the equation , with = ( m^2 - ) ^-1 . if @xmath348 , which corresponds to the case in which the energy scale of the low energy dynamics is much smaller than the energy scale associated to the heavy fields , we simply have , [ eq - delta-4 ] this is the typical deviation from the true minimum of the potential if the surface of this minimum is not geodesic . to be more general ,",
    "let us focus on a class of background trajectories in which ~ ( ) . this is a very reasonable situation to look into ( our previous example is a particular case of this ) as it correspond to those cases in which the main scale encoding the geometrical effects in the trajectory is its curvature .",
    "then , if the non - vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath346 are much larger than @xmath349 we can neglect the first term in ( [ eq - delta-2 ] ) and write c^a _ b ( _ * ) ^b .",
    "[ eq - delta-3 ] thus more generally @xmath350 is indeed a good measure of the deviation from the true minimum .",
