    "flows of realistic mixtures of miscible fluids exhibit several features that make them more difficult to simulate numerically than flows of simple fluids .",
    "firstly , the physical properties of the mixture depend on the concentration of the different species composing the mixture .",
    "this includes both the density of the mixture at constant pressure , and transport coefficients such as viscosity and mass diffusion coefficients .",
    "common simplifying assumptions such as the boussinesq approximation , which assumes a constant density and thus incompressible flow , or assuming constant transport coefficients , are uncontrolled and not appropriate for certain mixtures of very dissimilar fluids .",
    "secondly , for liquid mixtures there is a large separation of time scales between the various dissipative processes , notably , mass diffusion is much slower than momentum diffusion .",
    "the large schmidt numbers @xmath0 typical of liquid mixtures lead to extreme stiffness and make direct temporal integration of the hydrodynamic equations infeasible .",
    "lastly , flows of mixtures exhibit all of the numerical difficulties found in single component flows , for example , well - known difficulties caused by advection in the absence of sufficiently strong dissipation ( diffusion of momentum or mass ) , and challenges in incorporating thermal fluctuations in the description . here",
    "we develop a low mach number approach to isothermal binary fluid mixtures that resolves many of the above difficulties , and paves the way for incorporating additional physics such as the presence of more than two species @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , multiple phases and surface tension @xcite , and others .",
    "stochastic fluctuations are intrinsic to fluid dynamics because fluids are composed of molecules whose positions and velocities are random .",
    "thermal fluctuations affect flows from microscopic to macroscopic scales @xcite and need to be consistently included in all levels of description .",
    "fluctuating hydrodynamics ( fhd ) incorporates thermal fluctuations into the usual navier - stokes - fourier laws in the form of stochastic contributions to the dissipative momentum , heat , and mass fluxes @xcite .",
    "fhd has proven to be a very useful tool in understanding complex fluid flows far from equilibrium @xcite ; however , theoretical calculations are often only feasible after making many uncontrolled approximations @xcite , and numerical schemes used for fluctuating hydrodynamics are usually far behind state - of - the - art deterministic computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) solvers .    in this work ,",
    "we consider binary mixtures and restrict our attention to isothermal flows .",
    "we consider a specific equation of state ( eos ) suitable for mixtures of incompressible liquids or ideal gases , but otherwise account for advective and diffusive mass and momentum transport in full generality .",
    "recently , some of us developed finite - volume methods for the incompressible equations @xcite .",
    "we have also developed low mach number isothermal fluctuating equations @xcite , which eliminate the stiffness arising from the separation of scales between acoustic and vortical modes @xcite .",
    "the low mach number equations account for the fact that for mixtures of fluids with different densities , diffusive and stochastic mass fluxes create local expansion and contraction of the fluid . in these equations",
    "the incompressibility constraint should be replaced by a `` quasi - incompressibility '' constraint @xcite , which introduces some difficulties in constructing conservative finite - volume techniques @xcite . in section [ sec : equations ] we review the low mach number equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for a binary mixture of miscible fluids , as first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the numerical method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite uses an explicit temporal integrator .",
    "this requires using a small time step and is infeasible for liquid mixtures due to the stiffness caused by the separation of time scales between fast momentum diffusion and slow mass diffusion . in recent work",
    "@xcite , some of us developed temporal integrators for the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics that have several important advantages .",
    "notably , these integrators are semi - implicit , allowing one to treat fast momentum diffusion ( viscous dissipation ) implicitly , and other transport processes explicitly .",
    "furthermore , these temporal integrators are constructed to be second - order accurate for the equations of linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics ( lfhd ) , which are suitable for describing thermal fluctuations around stable macroscopic flows over a broad range of length and time scales @xcite .",
    "importantly , the linearization of the fluctuating equations is carried out _ automatically _ by the code , making the numerical methods very similar to standard deterministic cfd schemes .",
    "finally , specific integrators are proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to handle the extreme separation of scales between the fast velocity and the slow concentration by taking an _ overdamped _ limit of the inertial equations . in this work ,",
    "we extend the semi - implicit temporal integrators proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for incompressible flows to account for the quasi - incompressible nature of low mach number flows .",
    "we apply these temporal integrators to the staggered - grid conservative finite - volume spatial discretization developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and additionally generalize the treatment of advection to allow for the use of monotonicity - preserving higher - order godunov schemes @xcite .",
    "our work relies heavily on several prior works , which we will only briefly summarize in the present paper .",
    "the spatial discretization we describe in more detail in section [ sub : advection ] is identical to that proposed by donev _",
    "et al _ @xcite , which itself relies heavily on the treatment of thermal fluctuations developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . a key development that makes",
    "the algorithm presented here feasible for large - scale problems is recent work by some of us @xcite on efficient multigrid - based iterative methods for solving unsteady and steady variable - coefficient stokes problems on staggered grids .",
    "our high - order godunov method for mass advection is based on the work of bell _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the temporal integrators developed in section [ sub : temporaldiscretization ] are a novel approach to low mach number hydrodynamics even in the deterministic context . in high - resolution finite - volume methods ,",
    "the dominant paradigm has been to use a splitting ( fractional - step ) or projection method @xcite to separate the pressure and velocity updates @xcite .",
    "we followed such a projection approach to construct an explicit temporal integrator for the low mach number equations @xcite .",
    "when viscosity is treated implicitly , however , the splitting introduces a commutator error that leads to the appearance of spurious or `` parasitic '' modes in the presence of physical boundaries @xcite .",
    "there are several techniques to reduce ( but not eliminate ) these artificial boundary layers @xcite , and for sufficiently large reynolds number flows the time step size dictated by advective stability constraints makes the splitting error relatively small in practice . at small reynolds numbers , however , the splitting error becomes larger as viscous effects become more dominant , and projection methods do not apply in the steady stokes regime for problems with physical boundary conditions .",
    "methods that do not split the velocity and pressure updates but rather solve a combined stokes system for velocity and pressure have been used in the finite - element literature for some time , and have more recently been used in the finite - volume context for incompressible flow @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate how the same approach can be effectively applied to the low mach number equations for a binary fluid mixture @xcite , to construct a method that is second - order accurate up to boundaries , for a broad range of reynolds numbers including steady stokes flow .",
    "we test our ability to accurately capture the static structure factor for equilibrium fluctuation calculations .",
    "then , we test our methods deterministically on two variable density and variable viscosity low mach number flows .",
    "first , we confirm second - order deterministic accuracy in both space and time for a lid - driven cavity problem in the presence of a bubble of a denser miscible fluid .",
    "next , we simulate the development of a kevin - helmholtz instability as a lighter less viscous fluid streams over a denser more viscous fluid .",
    "these tests confirm the robustness and accuracy of the methods in the presence of large contrasts , sharp gradients , and boundaries .",
    "next we focus on the use of fluctuating low mach number equations to study giant concentration fluctuations . in section [ sec : giantfluct ] we apply our methods to study the development of giant fluctuations @xcite during free diffusive mixing of water and glycerol .",
    "we compare simulation results to experimental measurements of the time - correlation function of concentration fluctuations during the diffusive mixing of water and glycerol @xcite .",
    "the relaxation times show signatures of the rich deterministic dynamics , and a transition from purely diffusive relaxation of concentration fluctuations at large wavenumbers , to more complex buoyancy - driven dynamics at smaller wavenumbers .",
    "we find reasonably - good agreement given the large experimental uncertainties , and observe the appearance of propagative modes at small wavenumbers , which we suggest could be observed in experiments as well .",
    "at mesoscopic scales , in typical liquids , sound waves are very low amplitude and much faster than momentum diffusion ; hence , they can usually be eliminated from the fluid dynamics description .",
    "formally , this corresponds to taking the zero mach number singular limit @xmath1 of the well - known compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics equations system @xcite . in the compressible equations ,",
    "the coupling between momentum and mass transport is captured by the equation of state ( eos ) for the pressure @xmath2 as a local function of the density @xmath3 and mass concentration @xmath4 at a specified temperature @xmath5 , assumed to be time - independent in our isothermal model .",
    "the low mach number equations can be obtained by making the ansatz that the thermodynamic behavior of the system is captured by a reference pressure @xmath6 , with the additional pressure contribution @xmath7 capturing the mechanical behavior while not affecting the thermodynamics .",
    "we will restrict consideration to cases where stratification due to gravity causes negligible changes in the thermodynamic state across the domain . in this case , the reference pressure is spatially constant and constrains the system so that the evolution of @xmath8 and @xmath9 remains consistent with the thermodynamic eos @xmath10 physically this means that any change in concentration must be accompanied by a corresponding change in density , as would be observed in a system at thermodynamic equilibrium held at the fixed reference pressure and temperature .",
    "the eos defines density @xmath11 as an implicit function of concentration in a binary liquid mixture . the eos constraint ( [ eq : general_eos ] )",
    "can be re - written as a constraint on the divergence of the fluid velocity @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total diffusive mass flux defined in ( [ eq : f_def ] ) , and the solutal expansion coefficient @xmath15 is determined by the specific form of the eos .    in this work",
    "we consider a specific _ linear _ eos , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the densities of the pure component fluids ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ) , giving @xmath21 it is important that for this specific form of the eos @xmath22 is a material constant independent of the concentration ; this allows us to write the eos constraint ( [ eq : div_v_constraint ] ) in conservative form @xmath23 and take the reference pressure @xmath24 to be independent of time .",
    "the specific form of the density dependence ( [ eq : beta_simple ] ) on concentration arises if one assumes that two incompressible fluids do not change volume upon mixing , which is a reasonable assumption for liquids that are not too dissimilar at the molecular level .",
    "surprisingly the eos ( [ eq : eos_quasi_incomp ] ) is also valid for a mixture of ideal gases .",
    "if the specific eos ( [ eq : eos_quasi_incomp ] ) is not a very good approximation over the entire range of concentration @xmath25 , ( [ eq : eos_quasi_incomp ] ) may be a very good approximation over the range of concentrations of interest if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are adjusted accordingly .",
    "our choice of the specific form of the eos will aid significantly in the construction of simple conservative spatial discretizations that strictly maintain the eos without requiring complicated nonlinear iterative corrections .    in fluctuating hydrodynamics , stochastic contributions to the momentum and mass fluxes that are formally modeled as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath28 is the shear viscosity , @xmath29 is the diffusion coefficient",

    "a standard asymptotic low mach analysis @xcite , formally treating the stochastic forcing as smooth , leads to the _ isothermal low mach number _ equations for a binary mixture of fluids in conservation form @xcite , @xmath36 where the deterministic and stochastic diffusive mass fluxes are denoted by @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a symmetric gradient , @xmath39 is the density of the first component , @xmath40 is the density of the second component , and @xmath41 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the gradient of the non - thermodynamic component of the pressure @xmath42 ( lagrange multiplier ) appears in the momentum equation as a driving force that ensures the eos constraint ( [ eq : div_v_constraint ] ) is obeyed .",
    "we note that the bulk viscosity term gives a gradient term that can be absorbed in @xmath42 and therefore does not explicitly need to appear in the equations .",
    "temperature dynamics and fluctuations are neglected in these equations ; however , this type of approach can be extended to include thermal effects . the shear viscosity @xmath43 and the mass diffusion coefficient @xmath44 in general depend on the concentration .",
    "note that the two density equations ( [ eq : rho1_eq],[eq : rho2_eq ] ) can be combined to obtain the usual continuity equation for the total density , @xmath45 and the primitive ( non - conservation law ) form of the concentration equation , @xmath46 our conservative numerical scheme is based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : momentum_eq],[eq : rho1_eq],[eq : div_v_constraint],[eq : rho_eq ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed the effect of the low mach constraint on the thermal fluctuations , suitable boundary conditions for the low mach equations , and presented a gauge formulation of the equations that formally eliminates pressure in a manner similar to the projection operator formulation for incompressible flows .",
    "importantly , the gauge formulation demonstrates that although the low mach equations have the appearance of a constrained system , one can write them in an unconstrained form by introducing a gauge degree of freedom for the pressure . for the purposes of time integration , one can therefore treat these equations as standard initial - value problems @xcite and use the temporal integrators developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics should be interpreted as a mesoscopic coarse - grained representation of the mass , momentum and energy transport in fluids @xcite . as such",
    ", these equations implicitly contain a mesoscopic coarse - graining length and time scale that is larger than molecular scales @xcite and can only formally be written as stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) .",
    "a coarse - graining scale can explicitly be included in the spdes @xcite ; such a coarse - graining scale explicitly enters in our finite - volume spatio - temporal discretization through the grid spacing ( equivalently , the volume of a grid cell , or more precisely , the number of molecules per grid cell ) .",
    "additional difficulties are posed by the fact that in general the noise in the nonlinear equations is multiplicative , requiring a careful stochastic interpretation ; the mori - zwanzig projection formalism @xcite suggests the correct stochastic interpretation is the kinetic one @xcite .    for compressible and incompressible flows , the spdes of",
    "_ linearized _ fluctuating hydrodynamics ( lfhd ) @xcite can be given a precise continuum meaning @xcite .",

    "here @xmath51 is the solution of a _ linear _ additive - noise equation obtained by linearizing ( [ eq : c_t_primitive ] ) to first order in the fluctuations and evaluating the noise amplitude at the deterministic solution ; more precisely , lfhd is an expression of the central limit theorem in the limit of weak noise . in this work , in the stochastic",
    "setting we restrict our attention to lfhd equations . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not need to write down the ( rather tedious ) complete form of the linearized low mach number equations ( for an illustration , see section [ sub : overdamped ] ) since the numerical method will perform this linearization automatically .",
    "namely , the complete nonlinear equations are essentially equivalent to the lfhd equations when the noise is sufficiently weak , i.e. , when the hydrodynamic cells contain many molecules .",
    "the low mach number equations pose additional difficulties because they represent a coarse - graining of the dynamics not just in space but also in time .",
    "as such , even the linearized equations can not directly be interpreted as describing a standard diffusion process .",
    "this is because the stochastic mass flux @xmath52 in the eos constraint ( [ eq : div_v_constraint ] ) makes the velocity formally white - in - time @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that there is a close connection between mass diffusion and advection by the thermally - fluctuating velocity field , and thus between @xmath52 and velocity fluctuations .",
    "this suggests that a precise interpretation of the low mach constraint in the presence of stochastic mass fluxes requires a very delicate mathematical analysis . in this work we rely on the implicit coarse - graining in time provided by the finite time step size in the temporal integration schemes to regularize the low mach equations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the applications we study here , we can neglect stochastic mass fluxes and assume @xmath53 , in which case the difficulties related to a white - in - time velocity disappear .      at small scales , flows in liquids are viscous - dominated and the inertial momentum flux @xmath54 can often be neglected in a zero reynolds number approximation . in addition , in liquids , there is a large separation of time scales between the fast momentum diffusion and slow mass diffusion , i.e. , the schmidt number @xmath55 is large .",

    "variable ( i.e. , concentration - dependent ) viscosity and mass diffusion coefficient can be handled using existing techniques although there are subtle nonlinear stochastic effects arising from the fact that the noise in the velocity equation is multiplicative and the invariant measure ( equilibrium distribution ) of the fast velocity depends on the slow concentration .    in the linearized",

    "our baseline spatio - temporal discretization of the low mach equations is based on the method of lines approach where we first discretize the ( s)pdes in space to obtain a system of ( s)odes , which we then solve using a single - step multi - stage temporal integrator .",

    "stochastic mass fluxes are associated with the faces of the regular grid , while for stochastic momentum fluxes we associate the diagonal elements with the cell centers and the off - diagonal elements with the nodes ( in 2d ) or edges ( in 3d ) of a regular grid with grid spacing @xmath80 .",
    "here we focus our discussion on three new aspects of our spatio - temporal discretization . after summarizing the dimensionless numbers that control the appropriate choice of advection method and temporal integrator , in section [ sub : advection ]",
    "we describe our implementation of two advection schemes and a discussion of the advantages of each . in section [ sub : gmres ] we describe our implicit treatment of viscous dissipation using a gmres solver for the coupled velocity - pressure stokes system . in section [ sub : temporaldiscretization ]",
    "we describe our overall temporal discretization strategies for the inertial and overdamped regimes .",
    "the suitability of a particular temporal integrator or advection scheme depends on the following dimensionless numbers : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "observe that the first two depend on the spatial resolution and the typical flow speed @xmath83 , while the schmidt number is an intrinsic material property of the mixture .",
    "also note that the physically relevant reynolds @xmath84 and peclet @xmath85 numbers would be defined with a length scale much larger than @xmath80 , such as the system size , and thus would be much larger than the discretization - scale numbers above . in this work ,",
    "we are primarily interested in small - scale flows with @xmath86 and large @xmath87 ( liquid mixtures ) .",
    "the choice of advection scheme for concentration ( partial densities ) is dictated by @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 , centered advection schemes will generate non - physical oscillations , and one must use the godunov advection scheme described below .",
    "however , it is important to note that in this case the spectrum of fluctuations will not be correctly preserved by the advection scheme ; if fluctuations need to be resolved it is advisable to instead reduce the grid spacing and thus reduce the cell peclet number to @xmath90 and use centered advection .",
    "the choice of the temporal integrator , on the other hand , is determined by the importance of inertia and the time scale of interest .",
    "if @xmath91 is not sufficiently small , then there is no alternative to resolving the inertial dynamics of the velocity .",
    "now let us assume that @xmath92 , i.e. , viscosity is dominant . if the time scale of interest is the advective timescale @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the system size , then one should use the inertial equations .",
    "however , the inertial temporal integrator described in section [ sub : temporaldiscretization ] will be rather inefficient if the time scale of interest is the diffusive time scale @xmath95 , as is the case in the study of diffusive mixing presented in section [ sec : giantfluct ] .",
    "this is because the crank - nicolson ( implicit midpoint ) scheme used to treat viscosity in our methods is only a - stable , and , therefore , if the viscous courant number @xmath96 is too large , unphysical oscillations in the solution will appear ( note that this problem is much more serious for fluctuating hydrodynamics due to the presence of fluctuations at _ all _ scales ) . in order to be able to use a time step size on the diffusive time scale , one must construct a _ stiffly accurate _ temporal integrator .",
    "this requires using an l - stable scheme to treat viscosity , such as the backward euler scheme , which is however only first - order accurate .",
    "constructing a second - order stiffly accurate implicit - explicit integrator in the context of variable density low mach flows is rather nontrivial .",
    "furthermore , using an l - stable scheme leads to a damping of the velocity fluctuations at large wavenumbers and is inferior to the implicit midpoint scheme in the context of fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we choose to consider separately the overdamped limit @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( note that the value of @xmath85 is arbitrary ) . in this limit",
    "we analytically eliminate the velocity as an independent variable , leaving only the concentration equation , which evolves on the diffusive time scale .",
    "we must emphasize , however , that the overdamped equations should be used with caution , especially in the presence of fluctuations .",
    "notably , the validity of the overdamped approximation requires that the separation of time scales between the fast velocity and slow concentration be uniformly large over _ all _ wavenumbers , since fluctuations are present at _ all _ lengthscales . in the study of giant fluctuations we present in section [ sec : giantfluct ] , buoyancy effects speed up the dynamics of large - scale concentration fluctuations and using the overdamped limit would produce physically incorrect results at small wavenumbers . in microgravity ,",
    "however , the overdamped limit is valid and we have used it to study giant fluctuations over very long time scales in a number of separate works @xcite .",
    "we have implemented two advection schemes for cell - centered scalar fields , and describe under what conditions each is more suitable .",
    "the first is a simpler non - dissipative centered advection discretization described in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this scheme preserves the skew - adjoint nature of advection and thus maintains fluctuation - dissipation balance in the stochastic context .",
    "however , when sharp gradients are present , centered advection schemes require a sufficient amount of dissipation ( diffusion ) in order to avoid the appearance of gibbs - phenomenon instabilities .",
    "higher - order godunov schemes have been used successfully with cell - centered finite volume schemes for some time @xcite . in these semi - lagrangian advection schemes , a construction based on characteristics",
    "is used to estimate the average value of the advected quantity passing through each cell face during a time step .",
    "these averages are then used to evaluate the advective fluxes .",
    "our second scheme for advection is the higher - order godunov approach of bell , dawson , and schubin ( bds ) @xcite .",
    "additional details of this approach are provided in section [ sub : bds ] .",
    "the bds scheme can only be used to advect cell - centered scalar fields such as densities .",
    "this is because the scheme operatse on control volumes , and therefore applying it to staggered field requires the use of disjoint control volumes , thereby greatly complicating the advection procedure for non - cell - centered data .",
    "we therefore limit ourselves to using the skew - adjoint centered advection scheme described in refs .",
    "@xcite to advect momentum .",
    "although some godunov schemes for advecting a staggered momentum field have been developed @xcite , they are not at the same level of sophistication as those for cell - centered scalar fields . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite a piecewise constant reconstruction is used , and in ref .",
    "@xcite only extrapolation in space is performed but not in time . in our target applications , there is sufficient viscous dissipation to stabilize centered advection of momentum ( note that the mass diffusion coefficient is several orders of magnitude smaller than the kinematic viscosity in typical liquids ) .",
    "the bds advection scheme is not skew - adjoint and thus adds some dissipation in regions of sharp gradients that are not resolved by the underlying grid .",
    "thus , unlike the case of using centered advection , the spatially discrete ( but still continuous in time ) fluctuating equations do not obey a strict discrete fluctuation - dissipation principle @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in high - resolution schemes such as bds artificial dissipation is added locally in regions where centered advection would have failed completely due to insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "furthermore , the bds scheme offers many advantages in the deterministic context and allows us to simulate high peclet number flows with little to no mass diffusion . for well - resolved flows with sufficient dissipation",
    "there is little difference between bds and centered advection .",

    "the presence of nontrivial density differences between the pure fluid components and nonzero mass diffusion coefficient , complicates the analysis even for centered advection , due to the presence of a nontrivial eos constraint on the fluid dynamics .",
    "it is a challenge for future work to develop improved numerical analysis of our schemes in both the deterministic and the stochastic setting .    in future work",
    ", we will demonstrate how to extend the algorithms proposed here to multispecies mixtures of liquids using a generalization of the low mach number constraint .",
    "the nontrivial multispecies formulation of the diffusive and stochastic mass fluxes has already been developed by some of us in the compressible setting @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to include thermal effects in our formulation , by treating the temperature in a manner similar to the way we treated concentration here .",
    "two key difficulties are constructing a spatial discretization that ensures preservation of an appropriately generalized eos , as well as developing temporal integrators that can handle the moderate separation of time scales between the ( typically ) slower heat diffusion and ( typically ) faster momentum diffusion .",
    "in particular , it seems desirable to also treat temperature implicitly .",
    "such implicit treatment of mass or heat diffusion is nontrivial because it would require solving coupled ( via the eos constraint ) velocity - temperature or velocity - concentration linear systems , and requires further investigation .    in the staggered - grid based discretization developed here",
    ", we can only employ existing higher - order godunov advection schemes for the cell - centered scalar fields such as concentration and density .",
    "it is a challenge for future work to develop comparable methods to handle advection of the staggered momentum field .",
    "this would enable simulations of large reynolds number flows .",
    "it should be noted , however , that our unsplit approach is most advantageous at small reynolds numbers .",
    "a challenge for future work on low mach number fluctuating hydrodynamics is to account for the effects of surface tension in mixtures of immiscible or partially miscible liquids .",
    "this can be most straightforwardly accomplished by using a diffuse - interface model , as some of us recently did in the compressible setting for a single - fluid multi - phase system @xcite .",
    "one of the key challenges is handling the fourth - order derivative term in the concentration equation in a way that ensures stability of the temporal integrator , as well as developing a consistent discretization of the korteweg stresses on a staggered grid @xcite .",
    "the semi - implicit temporal integrators we described here can deal well with a broad range of reynolds or schmidt numbers in the deterministic ( smooth ) setting . in the context of fluctuating hydrodynamics",
    ", however , all modes are thermally excited and treatment of viscosity based on a crank - nicolson method ( implicit midpoint rule ) are bound to fail for sufficiently large schmidt numbers ( or sufficiently low reynolds numbers ) . in this work we solved this problem for the case of infinite schmidt ,",
    "zero reynolds number flows by taking an overdamped limit of the original inertial equations before temporal discretization .",
    "it is a notable challenge for the future to develop uniformly accurate temporal integrators that work over a broad range of reynolds or schmidt numbers , including the asymptotic overdamped limit , in the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
