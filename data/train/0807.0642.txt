    "with the use of dss and the amm @xcite , the effects of spatially correlated additive and multiplicative noise have been discussed on the synchrony and variability in the coupled langevin model .",
    "our calculations have shown the following : ( i ) the synchrony is increased ( decreased ) by the positive ( negative ) correlation in additive and multiplicative noise [ eq . ( [ eq : f6 ] ) ] , ( ii ) although an applied pulse input works to increase the synchrony for correlated multiplicative noise , it is possible to decrease the synchrony when correlated additive noise coexists with uncorrelated multiplicative one , ( iii ) the local variability @xmath71 is almost independent of spatial correlations , while global variability @xmath72 is increased ( decreased ) with increasing the positive ( negative ) correlation , and ( iv ) information may be carried by variance and synchrony in input signals .",
    "the item ( iv ) is consistent with the results of refs . @xcite-@xcite and elucidates some phenomena observed in neuronal experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although we have applied the amm to the langevin model in this paper , it is possible to apply it to other types of stochastic neuronal models such as the fitzhugh and hodgkin - huxley models subjected to correlated additive and multiplicative noise , which is left as our future study .",
