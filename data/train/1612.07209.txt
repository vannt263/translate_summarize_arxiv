    "<S> traveling wave solutions to kawahara equation ( ke ) , transmission line ( tl ) , and korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation are found by using a modified elliptic function method which is a generalization of the @xmath0-method . </S>",
    "<S> this works by assuming that a polynomial ansatz satisfies a weierstrass equation , and has two advantages : first , it reduces the number of terms in the ansatz by an order of two , and second , it uses weierstrass functions which satisfy the elliptic equation for the dependent variable instead of the hyperbolic tangent functions which only satisfy the riccati equation with constant coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> when the polynomial ansatz in the traveling wave variable is of first order , the equation reduces to kdv equation with only a cubic dispersion term , while for the ke equation which includes a fifth order dispersion term the polynomial ansatz must necessary be of quadratic type .    by solving the elliptic equation with coefficients that depend on the boundary conditions , velocity of the traveling waves , nonlinear strength , and dispersion coefficients , in the case of kdv equation we find the well - known solitary waves ( solitons ) for zero boundary conditions , as well as wave - trains of cnoidal waves for nonzero boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> both solutions are either compressive ( bright ) or rarefactive ( dark ) , and either propagate to the left or right with arbitrary velocity .    in the case of ke with nonzero boundary conditions and zero cubic dispersion , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain cnoidal wave trains which represent solutions to the tl equation . </S>",
    "<S> for ke with zero boundary conditions and all the dispersion terms present , we obtain again solitary waves , while for ke with all coefficients present and nonzero boundary condition , the solutions are written in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions . </S>",
    "<S> for all cases of the ke we only find bright waves that are propagating to the right with velocity that is a function of both dispersion coefficients .    </S>",
