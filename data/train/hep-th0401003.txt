    "we consider a two - dimensional scalar field @xmath2 defined on the upper - half - plane , @xmath3 , which is free in the two - dimensional bulk but subject to a periodic boundary potential .",
    "the action is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a complex parameter which dials the strength and the phase of the periodic boundary interaction .",
    "the period of the potential is chosen such that the interaction has dimension one under boundary scaling .",
    "this ensures that the boundary theory preserves half of the conformal symmetry of the bulk system .",
    "this model arises in various contexts , for example , in connection with critical behavior in dissipative quantum mechanics @xcite , quantum hall edge states @xcite , and open string theory in an on - shell tachyon background @xcite .",
    "more recently a @xmath6 boundary conformal field theory involving a scalar field with a ` wrong - sign ' kinetic term and an exponential boundary interaction has been applied to the rolling tachyon field of an s - brane or an unstable d - brane @xcite .",
    "such a theory is related by analytic continuation of the field to the boundary theory considered here .",
    "a conformal field theory analysis of the model ( [ action ] ) , carried out a decade ago @xcite , revealed an underlying @xmath1 symmetry which allows many exact results to be established , including exact boundary states and the one - loop partition function . in this lecture",
    "we report on ongoing work aimed at calculating correlation functions of both bulk and boundary fields .",
    "the general problem involving fields carrying arbitrary momenta remains unsolved but we give a prescription for correlation functions of an important sub - class of fields , the so - called discrete primaries .",
    "we take the scalar field to be non - compact , _",
    "i.e. _  taking value in @xmath7 , although the compact case , where the field takes value on a circle of radius @xmath8 , is also of interest . in the absence of the boundary interaction , the field @xmath2 satisfies a neumann boundary condition at @xmath9 , and this is conveniently dealt with using the so - called doubling trick or method of images ( see f.ex .",
    "the theory on the upper half - plane is then mapped into a chiral theory on the full complex plane and the boundary eliminated . to see how this works we note that away from the boundary the free field can be written as a sum of left- and right - moving components , @xmath10 . for @xmath11 the neumann boundary condition on the real axis @xmath12 determines the right - moving field in terms of the left - moving one .",
    "we can therefore reflect the right - moving field through the boundary and represent it as a left - moving field in the lower - half - plane .",
    "the theory then contains only left - moving fields , but a left - moving field at @xmath13 in the unphysical lower - half - plane is to be interpreted as a right - moving field at @xmath14 in the physical region . and @xmath13 denote the complex conjugate of @xmath14 .",
    "we use @xmath15 for the argument of a right - moving field @xmath16 , but @xmath13 for that of a left - moving image field @xmath17 . ]    more generally , any quasi - primary field in the bulk separates into left- and right - moving parts @xmath18 . using the doubling trick @xmath19",
    "becomes a left - moving field @xmath20 , with holomorphic dimension @xmath21 .",
    "a bulk @xmath22-point function @xmath23 in the original theory on the upper - half - plane then becomes a @xmath24-point function of holomorphic fields @xmath25 on the infinite plane .",
    "it turns out that the doubling trick can be applied even when the boundary interaction in ( [ action ] ) is turned on .",
    "this is because the boundary potential can in fact be expressed in terms of the left - moving field alone @xmath26 the operators appearing in the interaction are currents of a left - moving @xmath1 algebra @xmath27 in the boundary action ( [ action ] ) the @xmath28 and @xmath29 currents are integrated along the real axis and in a perturbative expansion of a correlation function such integrals are repeatedly inserted into the amplitude . as usual , divergences arise when operator insertions coincide but , by a clever choice of regularization , callan  @xcite were able to sum the perturbation series explicitly to obtain the exact interacting boundary state .",
    "it turned out to be remarkably simple , with the net effect of the interaction being a global @xmath1 rotation , @xmath30 , acting on the free neumann boundary state .",
    "the bulk theory is that of a free boson .",
    "it contains holomorphic primary fields @xmath31 with conformal weight @xmath32 for all @xmath33 and also the corresponding anti - holomorphic fields . at special values of the momentum , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an integer or integer - plus - half , some descendant states have vanishing norm and new primary fields appear , the so - called discrete primaries @xcite , which come in @xmath1 multiplets labelled by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "the discrete fields @xmath38 in a given @xmath1 multiplet are degenerate in that they all have conformal weight @xmath39 .",
    "they are composite fields made from polynomials in @xmath40 , @xmath41 , _ etc .",
    "_  accompanied by @xmath42 , and normal ordered with respect to the free holomorphic propagator @xmath43 .",
    "the discrete fields have the following representation @xcite , @xmath44 where the lowering current is integrated along nested contours surrounding @xmath14 .",
    "a discrete bulk primary is constructed from a pair of holomorphic and anti - holomorphic primaries , @xmath45 a priori , the left- and right - moving fields can carry different @xmath1 labels .",
    "however , the spin @xmath46 takes an unphysical value unless @xmath47 .",
    "we are considering a non - compact free boson , which has no winding states , so we must also require @xmath48 , which amounts to @xmath49 .",
    "finally we have @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "when a bulk field approaches the boundary at @xmath52 , new divergences appear that are not removed by the bulk normal ordering .",
    "this is a general feature of conformal field theories with boundaries and signals the presence of so called boundary operators .",
    "the boundary conditions to either side of a boundary operator can be different , in which case it is called a boundary condition changing operator ( see for example @xcite ) . in a general boundary",
    "conformal field theory a bulk field approaching the boundary can be expanded in terms of boundary fields @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 are boundary fields ( possibly boundary condition changing ) with boundary scaling dimensions @xmath56 and the @xmath57 are called bulk - to - boundary operator product coefficients .",
    "in addition to the bulk - to - boundary ope , the boundary fields form an operator product algebra amongst themselves , @xmath58 the boundary ope coefficients @xmath59 and the bulk - to - boundary ope coefficients @xmath57 , along with the boundary scaling dimensions @xmath56 , are characteristic data of a given boundary conformal field theory .",
    "in particular , the boundary scaling dimension @xmath56 of a boundary operator @xmath55 is given by the energy eigenvalue of the corresponding open string state , where the open - string hamiltonian is the @xmath60 generator of the virasoro algebra that is preserved by the conformally invariant boundary conditions .",
    "in the theory at hand , boundary conditions are labelled by the boundary coupling @xmath5 in ( [ action ] ) .",
    "a boundary condition changing operator that changes @xmath5 to @xmath61 at the insertion point corresponds to an open string state where the two string endpoints interact with boundary potentials of different strength @xmath5 and @xmath61 . to work out the open string spectrum we find it convenient to re - express the interacting boundary theory in terms of free fermions as shown in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 currents are bi - linear in the fermions and the boundary interaction may be viewed as a localized mass term .",
    "the open string spectrum is then found by solving a straightforward eigenvalue problem for the fermions .",
    "we will not repeat the construction here but simply quote the result . in @xcite",
    "both string endpoints were taken to interact with the same boundary potential , _",
    "i.e. _  it was assumed that @xmath62 . in this case",
    "the partition function may be written @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dedekind eta function , @xmath65 with @xmath66 the parameter length of the open string , and @xmath67 is related to the target space momentum @xmath68 by @xmath69 the value of @xmath67 is determined by continuity from @xmath70 at @xmath11 .",
    "the scaling dimensions of the corresponding boundary operators are given by @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "the spectrum obtained from ( [ ggspectrum ] ) is shown in the left - most graph in .",
    "the free spectrum , @xmath73 , has split into bands with forbidden gaps in energy in between them .",
    "note that the energy eigenvalues are invariant under @xmath74 for any integer @xmath22 .",
    "the boundary potential breaks translation invariance in the target space to a discrete subgroup and target space momentum is only conserved mod @xmath75 in our units in the interacting system .",
    "the momentum of a given operator can therefore always be shifted into the so - called first brillouin zone , @xmath76 .",
    "the spectra in are displayed in an extended zone scheme , with the periodicity appearing explicitly .",
    "it is interesting to note that bands also appear in the open string channel of the boundary conformal field theory of a free boson compactified on a circle , when the radius of the circle is an irrational multiple of the self - dual radius @xmath77 @xcite . like the system we are considering here ,",
    "those theories admit a one - parameter family of boundary states that interpolate between neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions , but it is unclear to us at present how deep the parallels between the systems run .",
    "the band spectrum described by ( [ ggspectrum ] ) is a special case of a more general structure that appears when we allow for open strings with different boundary coupling , @xmath5 and @xmath61 , at the two endpoints . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the fermion eigenvalue problem solved in @xcite can easily be extended to cover this case also .",
    "the only modification is to change @xmath5 to @xmath61 in one of the boundary mass terms for the worldsheet fermions in equation ( 29 ) of that paper , leaving the other one unchanged .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the spectrum then becomes @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "clearly this reduces to the previous result ( [ ggspectrum ] ) as @xmath82 but when @xmath83 there are important new features .",
    "in particular , there are additional gaps in the spectrum as shown in .",
    "but the other one takes the values a )  @xmath84 , b )  @xmath85 , c )  @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig : genspectrum ] ]",
    "in this section we consider scattering amplitudes involving bulk fields .",
    "general bulk amplitudes are functions of the boundary coupling @xmath5 and our goal is to determine this dependence .",
    "some bulk amplitudes that are zero in the free theory are nonvanishing in the presence of the boundary interaction . the periodic boundary potential breaks translation invariance in the target space and can absorb momenta in @xmath75 .",
    "callan @xcite gave a simple prescription for scattering amplitudes that describe elementary string excitations reflecting off the interacting worldsheet boundary .",
    "their method , which can be called _ the method of rotated images _",
    ", rests on the fact that the bulk operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which create and destroy left- and right - moving excitations , are in fact currents of the underlying @xmath1 algebra .",
    "the method can be generalized to deal with bulk scattering amplitudes involving operators , which carry well defined @xmath1 quantum numbers , _",
    "i.e. _  the discrete bulk operators @xmath89 in equation ( [ discretebulkfield ] ) .    consider some number of these states inserted in the upper half - plane and use the method of images so that for each insertion @xmath90 .",
    "this is possible even with the boundary interaction turned on because the anti - holomorphic field @xmath91 commutes with the holomorphic @xmath1 currents in the interaction and reflects through the underlying neumann boundary condition exactly as in the free theory . in a perturbative expansion of the bulk amplitude the @xmath1 currents that appear in the boundary interaction",
    "are repeatedly integrated along the real axis .",
    "their integration contours may be deformed away from the real axis into the lower - half - plane , where they will act on the image fields @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath1 current algebra ensures that there will be no cuts generated , and so the integration contours can be closed around the image fields .",
    "the net effect is the global @xmath1 rotation @xmath93 , given at the end of section  [ currentalgebra ] , acting on each image field insertion .",
    "the original right - moving discrete field was a component of a rank @xmath94 irreducible tensor operator , so the rotated image is @xmath95 with the rotation coefficient given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 are standard @xmath1 states .    a bulk @xmath22-point function",
    "is then expressed in terms of @xmath24 point functions of free holomorphic fields and @xmath1 rotation coefficients , @xmath98    as a simple example of this prescription we consider the one - point function of a general discrete bulk primary , @xmath99 conformal invariance requires the scaling dimension of the two chiral operators to be the same , i.e. @xmath100 , and momentum conservation in the free chiral theory requires @xmath101 .",
    "the one - point function is therefore @xmath102 for comparison , note that in the free theory with neumann boundary conditions the only bulk operator that has a non - vanishing one - point function is the unit operator .",
    "higher - point bulk amplitudes involving discrete fields can be computed in an analogous fashion , but unfortunately our prescription can not be applied to all bulk amplitudes in the model . in general , bulk amplitudes will involve both the discrete bulk fields and fields carrying generic target space momenta .",
    "the only constraint from momentum conservation is that the total momentum of all the fields in a given correlator add up to an integer times @xmath103 in our units .",
    "the operator product of the currents in the boundary interaction and generic momentum fields is non - local , and so the effect of the interaction is no longer captured by a global @xmath1 rotation .",
    "the physics of the open string sector is encoded in correlation functions of boundary operators as discussed in section  [ boundaryfields ] .",
    "it is straightforward to identify the boundary operators in the free theory .",
    "consider bringing a bulk primary operator at generic momentum @xmath104)$ ] close to the boundary . now",
    "replace the right - moving part by its left - moving image and apply the left - moving ope , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and the boundary scalar field is related to the left - moving field by @xmath107 .",
    "for the discrete bulk fields one obtains @xmath108 the @xmath109 are primary fields on the boundary , which we refer to as _ discrete boundary fields_. the superscript on @xmath110 signals that these are boundary operators of the free theory . the bulk - to - boundary",
    "ope coefficients @xmath111 can be obtained by straightforward calculation . by momentum conservation",
    "they vanish unless @xmath112 .",
    "the discrete boundary fields inherit the @xmath1 structure from the chiral discrete fields , but since @xmath113 we find that only integer values of @xmath114 are allowed on the boundary .",
    "the boundary scaling dimension of @xmath110 is @xmath115 .",
    "we are interested in calculating amplitudes involving arbitrary boundary fields in the interacting theory , including boundary condition changing fields .",
    "this is delicate since operators are now inserted on the boundary where the non - linear self - interaction takes place .",
    "we can nevertheless anticipate the structure of low - order amplitudes from conformal symmetry .",
    "for two- and three - point functions one finds @xmath116 is the scaling dimension obtained from equation .",
    "it remains to determine the @xmath5-dependence of the coefficients @xmath117 and @xmath59 .",
    "explicit calculations for fields carrying arbitrary momenta are difficult because such fields are non - local with respect to the @xmath1 currents in the boundary interaction , but we can proceed further with amplitudes involving the discrete boundary fields .",
    "a key observation , that can be read off from equation , is that the boundary scaling dimension of @xmath118 is @xmath115 , independent of the coupling . as a result",
    "we can write @xmath118 as a linear - combination of free boundary operators within the same @xmath1 multiplet @xmath119 we now write the general bulk - to - boundary ope at non - zero boundary coupling , @xmath120 we then apply the method of rotated images as described in section  [ bulkamplitudes ] on the left - hand side , plug in the expansion ( [ eq : psig ] ) on the right - hand side , and use equation ( [ eq : dbb ] ) .",
    "this results in a set of algebraic equations that relate the ope coefficients @xmath121 and the expansion coefficients @xmath122 .",
    "unfortunately , there are not enough equations to determine all the coefficients , so we need further input .",
    "we propose the following prescription for determining @xmath122 .",
    "first the free boundary operators @xmath110 are obtained as in equation .",
    "the effect of the interaction on these operators is then computed by letting the integration contours of the boundary currents approach the real axis , where @xmath110 is inserted , from above .",
    "the contours are then moved into the lower - half - plane , resulting in an @xmath1 rotation acting on @xmath110 , giving @xmath123 .",
    "this leads to boundary amplitudes of the form @xmath124 and bulk - to - boundary ope coefficients @xmath125 we stress that other prescriptions are possible .",
    "one alternative would be to deform the integration contours into the upper - half - plane in which case @xmath126 and the effect of the interaction is shifted entirely into the bulk - to - boundary coefficients @xmath121 .",
    "we note , however , that the boundary amplitudes ( [ boundaryamplitudes ] ) have the desirable feature that momentum is only conserved modulo @xmath103 which reflects broken translation invariance .",
