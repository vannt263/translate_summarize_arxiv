    "underpotential deposition ( upd ) is the process by which a submonolayer or monolayer of one metal is electrochemically adsorbed onto another at electrode potentials that are positive with respect to the potential for bulk deposition .",
    "it occurs when the adsorbate adatoms are more strongly bound to the foreign substrate than to a substrate of their own kind @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been known since the early years of this century @xcite , but its study has intensified only during the last two decades @xcite .",
    "current - potential data for upd on single - crystal surfaces , obtained from cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) experiments , frequently display sharp current peaks @xcite .",
    "the shapes , positions , and number of these peaks depend on the substrate and the crystal plane on which the adsorption takes place @xcite , as well as on the nature of the electrolyte @xcite .",
    "it was already suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite that the cv current peaks separate ordered and disordered adsorbate structures , and it was later pointed out that the peaks themselves should correspond to phase transitions in the adsorbed layer @xcite .",
    "the upd phenomenon is of fundamental interest as an aspect of the detailed , microscopic structure of electrode  electrolyte interfaces , which is presently the focus of vigorous research @xcite .",
    "it provides a means of controlling the microscopic surface structure through the electrolyte composition and the applied potential , and likely applications are suggested by the observations that metallic submonolayers have the ability to significantly modify the catalytic activity of a substrate @xcite , and that upd is the first step in the liquid - phase epitaxial growth of metallic heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the phase - transition aspects of upd make this area of surface electrochemistry well suited for statistical - mechanical modeling @xcite .",
    "the first detailed , statistical - mechanical lattice - gas model for a upd system was introduced by huckaby and blum ( hb ) , who considered the electrosorption of copper ( cu ) onto the ( 111 ) plane of gold [ au(111 ) ] in the presence of sulfate @xcite .",
    "this system also has been intensively studied by a number of experimental techniques ( see sec .  [ sex ] ) , and the detailed data that are now available render it an excellent candidate for theoretical modeling .",
    "in this article we present a study of the upd of cu on well - characterized , single - crystal au(111 ) electrodes in sulfate - containing electrolytes , in which we employ both experimental and theoretical methods .",
    "the experimental techniques used are _ in situ _ cv and coulometry to detect the current peaks and measure the total charge transferred during the adsorption / desorption processes , and _ ex situ _ auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) and low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) to determine the adsorbed cu and sulfate coverages and the adlayer structure , respectively .",
    "in the theoretical part of the study we formulate a full , two - component lattice - gas model with effective , lateral interactions out to fourth - nearest neighbors .",
    "this is a generalization of the hb model @xcite . using group - theoretical ground - state calculations at zero temperature @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations at room temperature @xcite",
    ", we estimate the model parameters ( the effective , lateral interactions and electrovalences ) so as to obtain overall agreement with the available experimental data , including both our own and those of other groups . this theoretical approach has previously been applied to electrochemical problems by rikvold and co - workers @xcite , and it was most recently used to model the coadsorption of hydrogen with urea on single - crystal platinum ( 100 ) electrodes @xcite and with sulfate on rhodium ( 111 ) @xcite .",
    "it differs from the approach taken by hb in that we apply the full , two - component lattice - gas model to analyse _ global _ , as well as local features of the system s phase diagram and cv current profiles , and in that our room - temperature results are obtained by nonperturbative , numerical simulation .",

    "the upd of cu on au(111 ) in sulfate - containing electrolytes has been extensively studied , both by _ in situ _ techniques like cv , chronocoulometry @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , atomic - force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite , fourier - transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) @xcite , x - ray - absorption spectroscopy ( exafs and xanes ) @xcite , surface x - ray scattering @xcite , quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) @xcite , and by _ ex situ _ techniques , such as leed , rheed ( reflection high - energy electron diffraction ) and aes @xcite .",
    "electrolyte compositions used in several cv experiments ( including the present work ) are listed in table  [ table1 ] , together with potential scan rates and observed current - peak separations .",
    "the observation that the different electrolyte compositions included in table  [ table1 ] do not qualitatively change the shape of the voltammogram indicates that within this range of compositions the adsorbates remain the same . in this paper",
    "we assume these to be cu@xmath2 and so@xmath3 in solution , which are adsorbed as near - neutral cu and partially discharged or neutralized so@xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "a three - step experiment was performed by shi and lipkowski @xcite to clarify the roles of the different adsorbates . with 0.1 m perchloric acid ( hclo@xmath4 ) as the only electrolyte ( _ i.e. _ , with no copper added ) , the cv current in the double - layer range was weak , indicating that the ions present in the solution did not adsorb significantly on the surface . in the next step ,",
    "k@xmath5so@xmath4 was added , introducing hso@xmath6 and so@xmath3 ions into the solution .",
    "an adsorption peak then appeared , particularly during the positive - going scan .",
    "radiochemical studies @xcite indicate that this peak is due to sulfate adsorption with a maximum coverage of approximately 0.2 monolayers ( ml ) .",
    "this result agrees with chronocoulometric results @xcite and with earlier stm studies @xcite , in which a @xmath7 sulfate adlayer was indicated on the positive side of the voltammetric peak in the absence of copper , without @xcite or with @xcite a perchloric - acid supporting electrolyte .",
    "( in uhv studies with samples emersed at potentials for which the @xmath7 structure is observed _ in situ _ , only a @xmath8 surface structure is observed , presumably produced by desorption of water that was coadsorbed with the sulfate @xcite . ) finally , addition of cu@xmath2 [ as cu(clo@xmath4)@xmath5 ] caused the appearance of two sharp ( 1030  mv wide ) current peaks that totally dominate the voltammogram , as illustrated by our own data in fig .",
    "[ eclr](a ) .",
    "there is no two - peak feature in the cv if no copper is added . on the other hand ,",
    "if the copper concentration is kept fixed while the concentration of sulfate is reduced , either the peak heights are reduced , or the two peaks merge , or both effects are observed together @xcite . evidently , the coadsorption of cu and sulfate is mutually enhancing .",

    "the charge plateau in the potential region between the cv peaks ( approximately 200300  mv ) lies about 200  @xmath10c/@xmath11 below the charge density at 420  mv .",
    "if the reactions cu @xmath12 2e@xmath13 cu@xmath2 and so@xmath4 + 2e@xmath13 so@xmath3 are assumed across the right - hand peak ( peak  # 1 ) , the desorption of 2/3  ml of cu and 1/3  ml of sulfate would result in a total charge transfer in that potential region of 160  @xmath10c/@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this coverage ",
    "charge correspondence is supported by rheed and leed @xcite , by which a ( @xmath14 ) superstructure was observed in the potential region between the peaks .",
    "further , consistent results have been obtained by stm @xcite .",
    "corroborating evidence was also obtained in an _ in situ _ electrochemical qcm study @xcite . at the left - hand peak ( peak  # 2 ) and for still more negative potentials ,",
    "the cu coverage approaches 1  ml , and exafs results have suggested that sulfate adsorbs on top of the cu atoms when a monolayer of cu has been deposited on the au(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the measurements of shi and lipkowski @xcite and by our own aes results .",
    "the total change can therefore not be explained by the specified charge - transfer reactions , which would predict a much larger charge transfer than the one measured .",
    "shi and lipkowski @xcite derived an equilibrium electrocapillary equation and determined the relative interfacial tension from measurements of the electrode charge density , using the back - integration technique .",
    "the cu coverage is then simply obtained as the derivative of the relative interfacial tension with respect to the electrochemical potential of cu .",
    "they compared the corresponding charge with the calculated cu coverage and concluded that the effective electrovalence of copper varies from 1.6 to 1.8 in the double - peak range of the electrode potential .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained in our present work .",
    "the total charge transfer measured from cv results varies among the reported experiments . in the potential range from 120 to 420  mv",
    "_ vs. _ ag / agcl , which includes both cv peaks , some of the available coulometric results give values about @xmath12350  @xmath10c/@xmath11 @xcite ( also the result of the present work ) , @xmath12460  @xmath10c/@xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12470  @xmath10c/@xmath11 @xcite , compared with the theoretical value of @xmath12444  @xmath10c/@xmath11 for a monolayer of ions transferring two electrons per ion to the au(111 ) surface .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , variation of the sulfate concentration from 0.01  mm to 5  mm changes the total charge transfer only by about 5% at the negative end of the upd potential range .",
    "likewise , variation of the cu(clo@xmath15 concentration from 0.01  mm to 5  mm also did not yield significant changes in the total charge .",
    "thus , it is highly unlikely that the large discrepancies between the experimentally measured charge transfers are due to the differences between the electrolyte compositions used .",
    "rather , we believe that the large charge transfers observed in refs .",
    "@xcite were due to unexpectedly large roughness of the electrodes .",
    "the only systematic studies of kinetic aspects of the upd in this system of which we are aware , are by hlzle , _ et al .",
    "they considered the dependence on the potential scan rate of the the separation between the positions of the positive- and negative - going cv current peaks ( _ i.e. _ , the hysteresis ) and the corresponding maximum current densities . in both cases",
    "they found a linear dependence on the square root of the scan rate .",
    "additional potential - step measurements , in which the potential was changed discontinuously from one side of a peak to the other , gave indications of first - order phase transitions and phase change via a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism .",
    "in this section we detail the experimental procedures employed in the present study , and we present our experimental results . in later sections these will be used to formulate our lattice - gas model and determine its parameters .",

    "the separations between the positive- and negative - going cv peak potentials were 24  mv for peak  # 1 and 44  mv for peak  # 2 , indicating that kinetic effects @xcite may contribute to the shape of the voltammogram to a nonnegligible degree , even at this relatively low scan rate .",
