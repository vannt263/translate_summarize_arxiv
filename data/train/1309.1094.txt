    "spectroscopy of hadrons is one of the key tools for studying quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "lattice simulations , which provide the only _ ab initio _ calculations of qcd in this regime , are now able to reproduce a large part of the experimentally observed ground state hadron spectrum .",
    "this development is important particularly for those processes which are difficult to explore in the laboratory , such as hyperon - hyperon and hyperon - nucleon interactions that may affect the late stages of the supernova evolution .",
    "the study of the double strangeness ( @xmath12 ) hypernuclei is of great importance in this context . the binding energies and widths of the @xmath0",
    "hypernuclear states are likely to determine the strengths of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 interactions .",
    "this basic information is key to testing the quark exchange aspect of the strong interaction because long range pion exchange plays essentially a very minor role in the @xmath15 sector .",
    "this input is also vital for understanding the multi - strange hadronic or quark matter . since strange quarks",
    "are negatively charged they are preferred in charge neutral dense matter .",
    "thus these studies are of crucial value for investigating the role of strangeness in the equation of state at high density , as probed in the cores of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction leads to the transfer of two units of both charge and strangeness to the target nucleus .",
    "thus this reaction is one of the most promising ways of studying the @xmath15 systems such as @xmath0 hypernuclei and a dibaryonic resonance ( @xmath16 ) , which is a near stable six - quark state with spin parity of @xmath17 and isospin 0  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction implants a @xmath0 hyperon in the nucleus through the elementary @xmath6 process .",
    "the cross sections for the elementary reaction were measured in the 1960s and early 1970s using hydrogen bubble chambers - the total cross section data from these measurements are tabulated in ref .",
    "it is essential to investigate first the @xmath1 reaction on a proton target leading to the production of a free @xmath18 hyperon .",
    "the input information extracted from this study will then be used in the description of the formation of @xmath18-hypernuclei using this reaction .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the production of free cascade hyperon and cascade hypernuclei via the @xmath1 reaction on proton [ fig .",

    "it retains the full field theoretic structure of the interaction vertices and treats baryons as dirac particles .",
    "the initial state interaction of the incoming @xmath5 with a free or bound target proton leads to excitation of intermediate @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonant states , which propagate and subsequently decay into @xmath19 . in case of the reaction on nuclei ,",
    "@xmath18 gets captured into one of the nuclear orbits , while the @xmath20 meson goes out .",
    "we have considered the intermediate resonant states , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and eight of their resonances with masses up to 2.0 gev [ @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , which are represented by @xmath29 and @xmath30 in figs .",

    "@xmath38 indicates the summation over all the resonance intermediate states . in eq .  1 , a and b represent the masses of the target and the residual nuclei , respectively . in case of the elementary reaction ,",
    "they are replaced by the proton mass and the cascade mass , respectively .    in order to calculate the amplitude @xmath39 for the elementary @xmath0 hyperon production reaction , one requires the effective lagrangians at the meson - baryon - resonance vertices ( which involve coupling constants and the form factors ) , and the propagators for various resonances .",
    "they were taken to be the same as those given refs .",
    "in addition , for the hypernuclear production reactions one needs spinors for the nucleon hole and @xmath18 particle bound states . we have used a phenomenological model to get them as discussed in the next section .",
    "in figs .  2(a ) , we show comparisons of our calculations with the data for the total cross section of the @xmath6 reaction as a function of @xmath5 beam momenta ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "it is clear that our model reproduces the data reasonably well within statistical errors .",
    "the measured total cross section peaks in the region of 1.4 - 1.5 gev / c which is well described by our model . in fig .",

    "this quantity is of interest as it enters explicitly into the expression for the cross sections of the @xmath31 reactions within the impulse approximation models ( see , e.g. ref .",

    "the thresholds for these reactions are about 0.761 gev / c and 0.750 gev / c , respectively .",
    "we have employed pure single - particle - single - hole @xmath44 configurations to describe the nuclear structure part . for the proton hole and @xmath18 states ,",
    "spinors were generated in a phenomenological model , where they are obtained by solving the dirac equation with scalar and vector fields having woods - saxon radial forms . with a set of radius and diffuseness parameters , the depths of these fields ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ) are searched to reproduce the binding energy ( be ) of a given state . since the experimental values of the bes for the @xmath18 bound states are as yet unknown , we have adopted in our search procedure the predictions for bes made in the latest version of the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite .",
    "this model predicts only one bound state for the @xmath47be hypernucleus with a binding energy of 3.038 mev and quantum numbers ( @xmath48 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath49 mg",

    "the values of radius and diffuseness parameters were taken to be 0.983 fm and 0.606 fm , respectively for both scalar and vector fields .",
    "the derived values of ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) were ( all in mev ) ( -112.11 , 90.81 ) , ( -133.53 , 108.16 ) , ( -188.98 , 153.08 ) and ( -205.70 , 166.65 ) for above four states , respectively .",
    "it may be noted that these values are obtained without including the coulomb interaction between @xmath18 and @xmath52b .",
    "@xmath45 + @xmath46 should be comparable to the depth of the corresponding conventional woods - saxon potential .    in case of the @xmath7c target ,",
    "the @xmath18 hyperon in a 1@xmath53 state can populate 1@xmath54 and 2@xmath54 states of the hypernucleus corresponding to the particle - hole configuration @xmath55 .",
    "the states populated for the @xmath49 mg hypernucleus are [ 2@xmath56 , 3@xmath56 ] , [ 1@xmath54 , 2@xmath54 , 3@xmath54 , 4@xmath54 ] , and [ @xmath59 , @xmath60 corresponding to the configurations @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , respectively . in fig .  3",
    ", we have shown results for populating the hypernuclear state with maximum spin of natural parity for each configuration .",
    "we have used a plane wave approximation to describe the relative motion of kaons in the incoming and outgoing channels .",
    "however , distortion effects are partially accounted for by introducing reduction factors to the cross sections as described in refs .",
    "it should be noted that the cross sections obtained with the spinors calculated within the qmc model are very close to those shown in fig",
    ".  3 @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest to note that the cross sections shown in both figs .",

    "it is clear from fig .  3 that for both the hypernuclear production reactions , the cross sections peak at @xmath40 around 1.0 gev / c which is @xmath65 0.3 gev / c above the production thresholds of the two reactions .",
    "it is not too different from the case of the elementary @xmath18 production cross sections where the peaks of the cross sections occur at about 0.35 -0.40 gev / c above the corresponding production threshold ( see fig  2 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the cross sections for the @xmath47be production are in excess of 1 @xmath66 near the peak position .",
    "it is important to note that at the beam momentum of 1.6 gev / c , the magnitude of our cross section for this case is similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite within an impulse approximation model . moreover , our cross sections at 1.8 gev / c also are very close to those of ref .",
    "@xcite for both the targets .",
    "a more rigorous consideration of the distortion effects could alter the pattern of the beam momentum dependence , _",
    "e.g. _ it is likely to be relatively stronger at lower values of @xmath40 as compared to higher values .",
    "furthermore , coulomb interactions between @xmath18 and the core nucleus may also have some effect for heavier targets .",
    "these effects will be investigated in a future publication .     as a function of @xmath5 beam momentum for the @xmath7c@xmath8be and @xmath9si@xmath10 mg reactions .",

    "arrows show the threshold for the corresponding reaction . ]",
    "in summary , we studied the production of @xmath18 hyperon and the corresponding hypernuclei in the @xmath1 reaction on proton and nuclear targets , respectively within an effective lagrangian model where the reaction proceeds via excitation , propagation and decay of @xmath3 and @xmath4 hyperon resonance states in the initial collision of @xmath5 meson with the initial free or bound proton . in the calculations of @xmath18 hypernuclear production",
