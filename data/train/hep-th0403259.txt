    "the spacetime non - commutativity @xmath13 does not prevent the holomorphy @xcite , but @xmath12 does .",
    "therefore , when one take the commutative limit @xmath25 , @xmath24 with the finite ratio @xmath21 , the holomorphy is recovered .",
    "since we are interested in field theories under the commutative limit , it is meaningful to consider the matter holomorphic terms in the non - commutative superspace as in the previous subsection .",
    "let us consider the feynman rules of this non - commutative theory .",
    "the propagator of @xmath30 is the same : @xmath36 . as in the usual non - commutative field theory , the three point vertex exhibits a non - commutative phase @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are momenta and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are fermionic momenta .",

    "however , when we consider this theory as a low energy theory of superstring , we can regard these amplitudes as the contributions of the background graviphoton field strength and ns - ns @xmath0 field .    the non - commutative superspace which we have considered arises on d - branes in type ii superstring theory in constant self - dual graviphoton field strength @xmath22 and constant ns - ns @xmath0 field background @xcite through , for example , calculation of hybrid formalism as in @xcite ,",

    "the appearance of the amplitudes of non - planar diagrams proportional to the background self - dual graviphoton field strength @xmath70 has been argued by ooguri and vafa in @xcite .",
    "we will make some comments about relations with our study in section [ 4 ] .",
    "we have shown that the amplitudes of the non - planar diagrams do not disappear . in dijkgraaf - vafa theory",
    "@xcite , the amplitudes of the planar diagrams in the supersymmetric theory are equivalent to that of the corresponding matrix model .",

    "we consider the action ( [ action3 ] ) with the general superpotential ( [ superpotential ] ) on the non - commutative superspace ( [ ncss1 ] ) .",
    "we map this field theory to a supermatrix model .",
    "to do so , we introduce some matrices corresponding to the non - commutative superspace , @xmath71 = -i c^{\\mu\\nu } , ~~c^{\\mu\\lambda}b_{\\lambda\\nu}={\\delta^\\mu}_\\nu , ~~\\hat{p}_\\mu = b_{\\mu\\nu}\\hat{y}^\\nu , ~~ [ \\hat{p}_\\mu , \\hat{p}_\\nu ] = ib_{\\mu\\nu},~~[\\hat{y}^\\mu,\\hat{p}_\\nu]=i \\delta^\\mu_\\nu , \\label{nccoordinate } \\\\ & \\ { \\hat{\\theta}^\\alpha , \\hat{\\theta}^\\beta \\ } = \\gamma^{\\alpha\\beta},~~ \\gamma^{\\alpha\\beta}\\beta_{\\beta\\gamma}={\\delta^\\alpha}_{\\gamma},~~ \\hat{\\pi}_\\alpha=\\hat{\\theta}^{\\beta}\\beta_{\\beta\\alpha},~~ \\{\\hat{\\pi}_\\alpha,\\hat{\\pi}_\\beta \\}=\\beta_{\\alpha\\beta } , ~~ \\ { \\hat{\\theta}^\\alpha,\\hat{\\pi}_\\beta \\}=\\delta^\\alpha_\\beta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , fields on the non - commutative space correspond to matrices as follows @xcite , @xmath72 the differential and integral operators are also mapped as follows , @xmath73,\\\\ & \\int d^4y~{\\text{tr}}_{u(n)}o(y)=(2\\pi)^2\\sqrt{\\det c}{\\text{tr}}_{u(\\hat{n } ) } ( \\hat{o } ) , \\label{int1}\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta^\\alpha}o(y,\\theta ) \\leftrightarrow [ \\hat{\\pi}_\\alpha,\\hat{o } \\},\\\\ & \\int d^2\\theta~ q(\\theta ) = \\frac{i}{8\\sqrt{\\det \\gamma } } { \\text{str}}_{\\theta } \\left ( \\hat{q } \\right),\\label{int2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 denotes a supertrace defined as in @xcite . then , we can reduce the action ( [ action3 ] ) to @xmath75 here , the hat indicates that the superfield is reduced as in ( [ weyl ] ) and their component fields are reduced as in ( [ weyl2 ] ) . and",
    "@xmath76 and their component fields are mapped to matrices as in ( [ weyl2 ] ) with respect to @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 . ]",
    "the matter kinetic term and anti - holomorphic terms are functions of @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath5 is the infinite rank of the matrices and it is related to the bosonic non - commutativity @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we introduce an appropriate dimensionful constant @xmath15 in the supermatrix model that is related to the non - commutative parameters through , @xmath79    we can construct in this way a reduced model of the gauge theory ( [ action3 ] ) in a non - commutative space ( [ ncss1 ] ) , which exhibits a different non - commutativity compared to the model ( [ ncss01 ] ) which was studied in @xcite .      as in section 2 , the matter holomorphic terms of the action ( [ action1 ] ) are important to understand the holomorphic parts of the low energy effective theory .",
    "therefore , we discuss the action : @xmath80 and consider the associated non - commutative field theory , @xmath81    in this theory , we can show the equivalence of correlation functions : @xmath82 here we use ( [ int1 ] ) , ( [ int2 ] ) , ( [ c - n ] ) and the equation @xcite : @xmath83 @xmath84 on the right hand side of ( [ map1 ] ) indicates that we evaluate this amplitude in the non - commutative theory ( [ action7 ] ) as in section [ 21.2 ] .",
    "the left hand side is evaluated in the corresponding supermatrix model ( [ action4 ] ) .",
    "the left side can be expanded in powers of @xmath85 , @xmath86 here the lower right indices represent the contributions of the higher genus diagrams .",
    "correspondingly , this can be mapped to @xmath87 this means that the supermatrix model is equivalent to the non - commutative field theory for non - planar diagrams of genus @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89    this equivalence has been established on the non - commutative superspace .",
    "we are interested in studying this equivalence under the commutative limits , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "when we take these limits , a @xmath90 singularity appears in equation ( [ map3 ] ) and we need to regularize it as in ( [ k ] )",
    ". then we obtain @xmath91 in this equation , the left hand side is of order @xmath92 and the right hand side is of order @xmath93 compared to the leading order ( planar diagrams ) . therefore , if @xmath21 is finite , the contribution of non - planar diagrams in the field theory is finite , corresponding to the supermatrix model with finite @xmath94 .    using ( [ f - n2 ] ) , ( [ f - n ] ) and ( [ c - n ] ) , we can obtain , @xmath95 in the context of superstring background fields . therefore , we can regard the contributions of the non - planar diagrams in the supermatrix model as that of these fields .",
    "this field theory is commutative but it is different from the usual commutative field theory@xcite in which the non - planar diagrams do not contribute to the amplitude .",
    "however , when we take the ratio @xmath96 to zero , the contribution of non - planar diagrams disappear and our field theory can reproduce the calculation of the usual field theory . in this sense , our theory can be regarded as an extension of dijkgraaf - vafa theory .",
    "this result is consistent with the study of symmetries and mass dimension in @xcite .",
    "in these papers , they calculate some charges and mass dimensions of operators and coupling constants , and they conclude that the symmetries forbid the non - planar diagrams to contribute to the holomorphic quantities in the supersymmetric gauge theory . however , in our argument , we add the new constant @xmath21 which also has these charges and mass dimension .",
    "therefore our calculation does not contradict their arguments .",
    "dijkgraaf - vafa theory shows the equivalence of the prepotential @xmath97 of this gauge theory and the free energy @xmath98 of this matrix model@xcite . as in @xcite ,",
    "these quantities satisfy equations @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a coupling constant in ( [ superpotential ] ) and @xmath101 is a fermionic parameter in the prepotential of the @xmath1 field theory . since these equations hold including all diagrams , the equation ( [ map2 ] ) shows the equivalence of @xmath97 and @xmath98 including non - planar diagrams . as a result ,",
    "dijkgraaf - vafa theory is applicable for non - planar diagrams as well .",
    "we have shown the equivalence between a field theory and a supermatrix model including non - planar diagrams and understood how the graviphoton field strength and @xmath0 field background contribute to these non - planar diagrams .",
    "our approach can be regarded as a new way to derive dijkgraaf - vafa theory from superstring theory .",
    "it is interesting to compare our approach with the original dijkgraaf - vafa approach @xcite .",
    "our argument is also applicable to field theories with gauge groups that are the products of some unitary groups coupled to adjoint , bifundamental and/or fundamental matter @xcite and we can study how the non - planar diagrams contribute to them .",
    "our result that the graviphoton contributes to the non - planar diagrams can also be derived from arguments using diagrams @xcite or schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "these arguments use the c - deformation @xcite : @xmath102 and consider the theory on the commutative space .",
    "( this deformation undoes the non - commutative superspace . )",
    "the background fields in the superstring theory are different , however our non - commutative superspace approach and this c - deformation approach give the same result in the field theory .",
    "these two approaches should be related in some way .",
    "the meaning of the @xmath4 correction is not clearly understood in general reduced models .",
    "we have shown how the graviphoton and @xmath0 field , which are closed superstring background , contribute to the @xmath4 corrections in our reduced model .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our approach to the graviton multiplet @xcite and propose some relation between closed string theory and reduced models .    the relation between non - planar diagrams and the graviphoton has also been advocated in the @xmath103 field theory context @xcite .",
