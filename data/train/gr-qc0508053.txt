    "these results suggest that there exists dark energy ( de ) with negative pressure in the universe , and the de was subdominant in the past and dominates the universe now .",
    "the presence of de has a lot of interesting physical effects .",
    "for example , there exists an event horizon if the acceleration is eternal .",
    "the event horizon sets a causal limit that the observers can ever access .",
    "the existence of eternal acceleration also prevents us from ever measuring inflationary perturbations which originated before the ones currently observable @xcite .",
    "the de physics is still a challenging topic .",
    "the current supernova ia ( sn ia ) data is unable to distinguish different de models and different de parameterizations @xcite .",
    "starkman , trodden and vachaspati ( stv ) addressed the problem of inflation in our patch of the universe with the help of the concept of the minimal anti - trapped surface ( mas ) @xcite .",
    "they argued that if we can confirm the acceleration up to a redshift @xmath14 and observe the contraction of our mas , then we are certain that our universe is inflating .",
    "if we see the contraction of our mas , then we observe the onset of inflation .",
    "the immediate conclusion is that our universe is undergoing inflation because the cosmic acceleration is confirmed up to the redshift @xmath15 by the sn 1997ff .",
    "stv found that the period of acceleration has not lasted long enough for observations to confirm the onset of inflation for the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the work of stv is based on the earlier work of vachaspati and trodden , who proved that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe , the necessary and sufficient condition for observing the contraction of the mas is that the universe is vacuum dominated in a region of radius greater than the hubble size @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the comoving contraction of our mas is the essence of inflation .",
    "thus only if a region of size greater than @xmath16 remains vacuum dominated long enough for the mas to begin collapsing then we are certain that the universe is undergoing inflation @xcite .",
    "because the hubble size is increasing with time in general , so the later the transition time ( the smaller the redshift @xmath17 ) is , the longer inflation needs to last ( the larger @xmath18 is , where @xmath2 is the scale factor at the time when the onset of acceleration is first seen . ) .",
    "avelino , de carvalho and martins then replaced the hubble size by the event horizon with some additional assumptions @xcite .",
    "if the event horizon criterion is used , then the smaller @xmath17 is , the smaller @xmath18 we need .",
    "huterer , starkman and trodden also analyzed general de models and found that current observations are unable to confirm the onset of inflation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the holographic de model @xcite and the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model @xcite .",
    "vachaspati and trodden proved that inflationary models based on the classical einstein equations , the weak energy conditions , and trivial topology , must assume homogeneity on super - hubble scales . based on this result , stv introduced the concept of the mas to discuss the observability of the onset of inflation .",
    "the mas is a sphere , centered on the observer , on which the velocity of comoving objects is the speed of light @xmath19 @xcite . for light emitted directly toward the observer inside the mas ,",
    "the photons get closer to the observer with time , while all photons emitted by sources outside the mas get farther away . for a homogeneous and isotropic universe ,",
    "the physical radius of the mas at time @xmath20 is the hubble size @xmath21 .",
    "it was argued that the beginning of the comoving contraction of the mas can be identified with the onset of inflation .",
    "note that the condition of the onset of inflation is @xmath22 which is equivalent to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the scale factor .",
    "if a light was emitted at time @xmath25 from a source located at a comoving distance @xmath26 and then is received at time @xmath27 by the observer located at the origin , the physical distance between the source and the observer at @xmath25 is @xmath28 in this paper , we consider a flat universe .",
    "we can see the contraction of the mas at time @xmath27 if @xmath29 @xcite , here @xmath27 ( @xmath2 ) is the time ( scale factor ) when the turnaround of the mas comes into view .",
    "therefore , the onset of the late time inflation can be seen at time @xmath27 if @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the transition time when the universe experienced from the deceleration phase to the acceleration phase . to see the consequences of @xmath29 clearly , we use a simple de model @xmath32 with constant @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 as an example .",
