    "over the past 15 years , light - matter strong coupling has been studied extensively with organic materials lidzeynature1998,fujitaprb1998,schouwinkcpl2001,takadaapl2003,holmesprl2004,tischlerprl2005,michettiprb2005,hakalaprl2009,bellessaprl2004,dintingerprb2005,guebrouprl2012,ambjornssonprb2006,berrieracsnano2011 which can display very large splitting of the two hybrid light - matter states , also known as the polariton states .",
    "recently , optical resonances with small mode volumes such as fabry - perot nanocavities or surface plasmons have been used to achieve the so - called ultra - strong coupling where the rabi splitting approaching @xmath0 becomes a significant fraction of the electronic transition energy @xcite . for such large splittings , changes in bulk properties",
    "are observed , as already shown for the work - function @xcite and the ground state energy @xcite .",
    "it has also been noticed over the years that the lifetime of the lowest polariton state , denoted @xmath1 , is much longer than the lifetime of the photon in the cavity mode . in recent experiments using resonant excitation ,",
    "this @xmath1 lifetime has even been shown to be longer than that of the bare excited molecules @xcite .",
    "these properties are counter - intuitive in the conventional picture where the dynamic properties of the coupled states are directly determined from those of the bare ones @xcite . in the so - called markov approximation ,",
    "the effects of coupling and relaxation are simply added to each other in the master equation which describes the evolution of the system .",
    "it follows that the relaxation rates in the diagram of dressed states are obtained from those of bare states through a mere change of basis @xcite . in the ultra - strong coupling limit in particular",
    ", the low- and high - energy dressed states @xmath1 and @xmath2 contain identical proportions of the bare states and their lifetimes are thus expected to be equal to each other .",
    "the experimental observation of very different lifetimes for these two dressed states reveals that the relaxation of the dressed system is deeply influenced by the strong coupling . in other words",
    ", the relaxation of coupled organic molecules corresponds to a non - markovian regime where relaxation can only be studied after the effect of ultra - strong coupling has been taken into account @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we build up a new theoretical framework to understand the dynamics of ultra - strongly coupled organic molecules .",
    "in particular , we show that the relaxation inherent is intrinsically non - markovian in such a system .",
    "this new view on strongly coupled organic materials explains the most salient features experimentally observed in such systems , in particular the very long lifetime of the lower dressed state @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the case of organic molecules strongly coupled to a fabry - perot cavity mode .",
    "the organic molecules are doping a host polymer matrix at @xmath3 to @xmath4 molar concentration ( mole per litre ) .",
    "qualitatively , this corresponds to typical intermolecular separation distances of the order or larger than @xmath5 nm within the host matrix , so that frster - type energy transfer is expected to dominate over other intermolecular transfer mechanisms @xcite .",
    "absorption spectra on the right - hand side of the figure shows the effect of strong coupling which splits the molecular resonance in the coupled system ( dark curve ) , as compared to the uncoupled one ( red curve ) .",
    "we stress here that the widths of the molecular absorption peaks need not to be directly related to the intrinsic molecular lifetimes , due to inhomogeneous broadening and vibrational manifold .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening is crucial for coupled and uncoupled organic molecules to coexist in the cavity in the model discussed further down , and this prevents one to draw conclusions about intrinsic lifetimes from the measured spectral features .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening is due to distribution of orientations , locations and micro - environment of the organic molecules in the matrix .",
    "these features are essentially the same for coupled and uncoupled molecules , since the optical coupling does not affect the associated motions .",
    "in addition , the host matrix behaves as a vibrational relaxation reservoir in thermodynamic equilibrium with both coupled and uncoupled molecules .",
    "the vibrational reservoir spectra are characterized by a typical energy dispersion @xmath6 at room temperature , or equivalently a correlation time @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the condition of validity of the markov approximation @xcite would be that the rabi splitting @xmath9 be inefficient during the correlation time @xmath10 , that is equivalently @xmath11 .",
    "this condition is clearly not met for ultra - strong coupling of organic molecules , where the rabi splitting @xmath12 is much larger than @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the system is intrinsically in the non - markovian regime , with relaxation strongly influenced by the coupling . in other words",
    ", there is no reason to expect that the dressed states @xmath14 and @xmath1 have identical lifetimes , as it would be the case for ultra - strong coupling in the markovian approximation .",
    "furthermore , we will see below that the hierarchy of lifetimes observed in experiments is naturally explained by the approach proposed in this paper .    in our case , each individual molecule",
    "can only be weakly coupled to the electromagnetic mode of the cavity .",
    "the strong coupling mechanism necessarily involves a collective excitation of an extremely large number of molecules coherently coupled to the single mode of the cavity .",
    "it is important to stress that the strong coupling does not shield the molecules from intramolecular vibrational relaxation .",
    "this explains the extremely low emission quantum yields , as observed experimentally , with vibrational relaxation rates at least @xmath15 times larger than the radiative rate of @xmath1 .",
    "for instance in the case of tdbc presented in figure 1 , the fluorescence quantum yield of @xmath1 , angularly integrated , is found to be @xmath16 ( more numbers will be given below ) .",
    "we build up below the new framework which naturally allows us to analyze such situations .",
    "we show in particular that the non - markovian character explains the otherwise counter - intuitive long lifetime of the lower dressed state @xmath1 .",
    "we stress at this point that a problem dominated by radiative relaxation would lead to different conclusions @xcite .",
    "note also that , in what follows , dark states which are formed in the coherent state manifold when coupling a large number of molecules to one cavity mode are ignored @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their mere presence in the energy diagram also contributes to the non - radiative decay discussed further down .",
    "we consider uncoupled ( u ) and coupled ( c ) states as two populations in a dynamical equilibrium with the total concentration @xmath17=[\\mathrm{u}]+[\\mathrm{c}]$ ] fixed .",
    "this two - population model is a simplification of the real situation where there is a continuous distribution of molecules in the cavity mode with different positions , orientations or environments which lead to spectral inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "this model is based on recent experimental observations which have been shown to be explained in terms of two populations coexisting at thermal equilibrium with well defined gibbs free energies @xcite .",
    "as usually , the model has to be tested by comparing its predictions to experimental observations .",
    "the relevant states of the uncoupled molecules are , on the one hand , the ground and excited states of the molecule @xmath18 and @xmath19 and , on the other hand , the @xmath20 and @xmath21photon states of the cavity .",
    "the states of the hybrid `` molecule+cavity '' system are denoted @xmath22 for the ground state , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the excited ones ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the energy difference between the two excited states is @xmath25with @xmath26 the frequency of photons in the cavity mode and @xmath27 the frequency of the molecular transition .",
    "the detuning @xmath28 ( as the rabi coupling discussed in the next paragraph ) has a single value in the simplified two - population model whereas it would have a distribution of values in a microscopic description .",
    "the relevant states are similar for coupled and uncoupled molecules , with differences caused by the effects of the coupling .",
    "they are denoted @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the symbol c replacing u. the excited states @xmath30 and @xmath32 are coupled through the rabi coupling @xmath33 which is not zero for the coupled molecules .",
    "note that this rabi splitting has a large value , though the cavity has a low quality factor @xmath34 and remains in low states with only 0 or 1 photon .",
    "this unusual feature is due to the already discussed fact that the cavity field is coupled to a giant dipole corresponding to the coherent superposition of an extremely large number of molecules .",
    "the dressed states , denoted @xmath2 and @xmath1 , are obtained by diagonalizing the effect of the rabi coupling between the states @xmath30 and @xmath32 @xmath35with the angle @xmath36 defined by @xmath37@xmath2 is defined to have a higher energy than @xmath1 and the splitting between the two states is @xmath38the projection factors in eq.([dressed ] ) are @xmath39when the coupling is much larger than the detuning ( @xmath40 ) , these projection factors are nearly equal @xmath41 .",
    "all molecular states are connected in the molecular hamiltonian so that the splitting of @xmath2 and @xmath1 has consequences on the other states .",
    "this causes in particular a shift @xmath42 of the position of the ground state @xmath29 @xcite . with an observed rabi splitting @xmath43 and a distance between the ground and excited states @xmath44",
    ", this shift can not be neglected .",
    "a naive expectation @xmath45 from second order perturbation theory leads to a value consistent with the result of recent measurements @xmath46 . indeed , as this shift changes the energy differences between the states of uncoupled and coupled molecules , it can be measured in a thermodynamic approach as the standard gibbs free energy difference between the ground states of the uncoupled and coupled molecules @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the radiative relaxation processes which correspond to emission of a photon by the cavity while leaving the molecular state unaffected .",
    "the basis of the method is the application of fermi s golden rule to dressed states @xcite .    for the uncoupled molecules ,",
    "there is only one relaxation channel corresponding to the transition @xmath47 .",
    "simple rate equations describe the evolution of the populations @xmath48 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] due to this process @xmath49}{\\mathrm{d}t } = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{u}_{0}]}{\\mathrm{d}t } = - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{u}_{0}\\mathrm{u}_{1}}[\\mathrm{u}_{1 } ] ~,\\]]and they preserve the sum of the two populations .",
    "the transition rate @xmath50 , defined for the transition @xmath51 , is the product of a reduced rate @xmath52 and a spectral density of optical modes evaluated at the frequency of the transition .",
    "absorption rate on the same transition is the product of the spontaneous emission rate @xmath53 by a photon flux @xmath54 at the relevant frequency @xmath49}{\\mathrm{d}t } = a_{\\mathrm{u}_{1}\\mathrm{u}_{0 } } [ \\mathrm{u}_{0 } ] \\,,\\ ; a_{\\mathrm{u}_{1}\\mathrm{u}_{0}}=\\gamma _ { \\mathrm{u } _ { 0}\\mathrm{u}_{1}}\\phi _ { \\mathrm{u}_{0}\\mathrm{u}_{1 } } \\label{pumping}\\ ] ] note that the low @xmath34 factor favors absorption events in the cavity and thereby strong coupling .    for the coupled states ,",
    "there are two radiative transition channels @xmath55 with rate equations @xmath56}{\\mathrm{d}t } = - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{c}_{0}\\mathrm{c}^{\\pm } } [ \\mathrm{c}^{\\pm } ] ~.\\ ] ] the rates are proportional to squared projection factors @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and to the spectral densities of optical modes at the transition frequencies . as these frequencies differ from the bare one , the values of the emission and absorption rates differ from the expectations deduced from the markov approximation .",
    "we note that the thermodynamical equilibrium is only slightly modified by the absorption processes .",
    "the total population of excited states does not exceeds a fraction of the order of @xmath59 in the case of static spectroscopic experiments ( @xmath60 for pump - probe measurements ) so that the depletion of ground states remains negligible .",
    "this means that the populations @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] remain close to their values in vacuum and also explains why stimulated emission processes can be disregarded .",
    "we now study vibrational relaxation processes which are the dominant relaxation mechanism for most organic molecules .",
    "they correspond to internal conversion of energy via a rapid cascade down the vibrational ladder of the molecule .",
    "typical organic molecules used in strong - coupling experiments have over @xmath15 fundamental vibration modes .",
    "another non - radiative relaxation process is the frster energy transfer between different molecules with conservation of energy .",
    "well known in molecular photophysics @xcite , these processes correspond to a transfer of excitation due to frster dipole - dipole coupling between molecules over distances of a few nm to a few tenths of nm .",
    "the energy excess , required for energy conservation , is dissipated by a vibrational cascade down to the lowest level of the corresponding electronic multiplicity , as sketched on figure 3 .",
    "though they involve coulomb interaction , these energy transfer mechanisms can be considered as non - radiative as they do not couple to the free radiation field .",
    "it is also worth noting that , at the small intermolecular distance scales where they occur , they are expected not to perturb efficiently the coherence of the collective dipole .",
    "we do not enter into a detailed microscopic description of these processes , well - known in molecular science , which leave the cavity state unaffected .",
    "we give qualitative descriptions which are sufficient for our purpose . a crucial feature in our case",
    "is that the thermal energy @xmath63 is much smaller than energy differences , so that downward transitions are dominant .",
    "the only exception to this rule is the case of transitions between ground states which correspond to a smaller energy shift @xmath42 and determine the thermodynamical equilibrium of the ground states of the coupled and uncoupled molecules @xcite .    for uncoupled states",
    ", there is only one non - radiative transition @xmath64 .",
    "as previously , this process is described by a rate equation @xmath65}{\\mathrm{d}t } = - w_{\\mathrm{u}_{0}\\mathrm{u}_{0}^\\ast}[\\mathrm{u}_{0}^\\ast].\\ ] ] the rate @xmath66 is the product of a reduced rate @xmath67 by a spectral density @xmath68 which represents the coupling of the two vibronic multiplicities and depends on the energy difference .",
    "this reduced rate is relatively small as this energy difference is much larger than @xmath69 . for coupled states ,",
    "there are similar transitions @xmath70 @xmath71}{\\mathrm{d}t } = w_{\\mathrm{c}_{0 } \\mathrm{c}^\\pm}[\\mathrm{c}^\\pm ] ~,\\ ] ] with @xmath72 and @xmath73 proportional to @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "there exists one relaxation channel which is opened by the strong coupling and could never be seen in the absence of this effect .",
    "it corresponds to the transition between the dressed excited states @xmath76 @xmath77}{\\mathrm{d}t } = - w_{\\mathrm{c}^{-}\\mathrm{c}^{+}}[\\mathrm{c}^{+ } ] ~,\\ ] ] with a rate proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "this new channel has a maximal rate when @xmath79 and is very similar to the collisional induced transitions studied in @xcite .",
    "note that , as the energy difference is smaller , the rate is larger than for transitions studied in the preceding paragraph .",
    "we come now to a second category of transitions occuring between coupled and uncoupled molecules schematized in figure 3 .",
    "such transitions are observed experimentally as energy transfer processes with well defined signatures @xcite . in the study of ground states ,",
    "we consider reverse transitions @xmath80 and @xmath81 because the energy difference @xmath42 is not so large with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "these transitions produce the thermodynamical equilibrium between populations of coupled and uncoupled molecules @xmath82}{[\\mathrm{u } _ { 0 } ] } = \\exp\\frac{\\hbar\\delta_0}{k_{\\mathrm{b}}t } ~.\\ ] ] this equilibrium favors coupled molecules for a downward shift @xmath83 of the coupled state .    for similar transitions between the excited states of coupled and uncoupled molecules , energy differences are large , and we consider only downward transitions @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the rates @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 are respectively proportional to @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath93 and @xmath92 and to spectral densities at the relevant frequencies .",
    "hence , they can only be calculated on the diagram of dressed states and are not determined by rates known for bare molecules .",
    "this situation , typical for a non - markovian regime , is in sharp contrast with the markov approximation where the downward and upward rates would be similar .",
    "magnitudes of the various rates are known from the experiments ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the largest rate corresponds to the radiative transition between uncoupled states @xmath94 which is strongly favored by the cavity . in particular",
    "it is much larger than other radiative rates which have values in the range of @xmath95 .",
    "large values are also obtained for non - radiative transition rates between excited states @xmath96 , which arise as consequences of strong coupling .",
    "the first one @xmath97 has a dependence @xmath98 which makes it large for molecules with a rabi coupling larger than the detuning .",
    "a similar discussion applies to the products of rates on the cascades @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "they correspond to two - step relaxation processes @xmath76 which are large when @xmath78 has its maximum value .",
    "these processes offer possibilities to explain a selection of strongly coupled molecules among a diverse population .",
    "the other non - radiative rates have smaller values @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these orders of magnitude allows one to write down a simplified system of rate equations .",
    "the largest absorption rate is indeed the one @xmath103 associated to the absorption from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and the main relaxation channel is then through non - radiative relaxation from @xmath104 to @xmath1 .",
    "the populations of the states @xmath105 and @xmath24 remain negligible at all times and can be ignored in the following simplified system of solutions @xmath106 \\left ( t\\right ) \\simeq \\int_{0}^{t}\\mathrm{d } t^{\\prime } ~e^{-r_{\\mathrm{u}_{1}}t^{\\prime } } a _ { \\mathrm{u}_{1}\\mathrm{u}_{0 } } \\left ( t - t^{\\prime } \\right ) [ \\mathrm{u}_{0 } ] ~ ,   \\\\ & & \\left [ \\mathrm{c}^{-}\\right ] \\left ( t\\right ) \\simeq \\int_{t_{0}}^{t } \\mathrm{\\ d}t^{\\prime } ~e^{-r_{\\mathrm{c}^{-}}t^{\\prime } } w_{\\mathrm{c}^{- } \\mathrm{u}_{1}}[\\mathrm{u}_{1}]\\left ( t - t^{\\prime } \\right ) ~ , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the total relaxation rates for states @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath111the population of @xmath23 follows the pumping rate ( [ pumping ] ) , with a delay determined by @xmath112 . as already stated , the population of @xmath22 is not significantly depleted and can be considered as constant .",
    "the population of @xmath113 follows the feeding from @xmath23 , with a delay determined by @xmath114 .",
    "as @xmath115 is @xmath116 times larger than @xmath117 , it follows that @xmath48 $ ] reaches a quasi - stationary value @xmath118 / r_{\\mathrm{u}_{1}}$ ] after a very short time @xmath119 . then @xmath120 $ ]",
    "shows a quasi - stationary behavior for a much longer time @xmath121 during which it is by far the most populated excited state and determines all observables .",
    "this explains the main feature observed in the experiments , that is the extremely long lifetime of the lower dressed state @xmath1 , which is much longer than that of other excited states .",
    "the decay of @xmath1 is dominated by the internal vibrational relaxation whereas the radiative decay ( fluorescence ) is a negligible pathway .",
    "even if the fluorescence rate is not suppressed , it is overwhelmed by the non - radiative rate enhanced in the strong coupling regime due to internal conversion via vibrational overlap between @xmath1 and @xmath29 .",
    "this increase of the non - radiative decay with respect to the radiative one is confirmed by the small emission quantum yield measured at the level of strongly coupled molecules ( numbers given below ) .",
    "meanwhile , the higher dressed state @xmath2 is much shorter lived due to the extremely rapid vibrational decay to @xmath1 and energy transfer to uncoupled molecules ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath2 turns out to be less than @xmath122 fs while the lifetime of @xmath1 is of the same order , at resonance , than that of the bare molecule @xcite .",
    "in fact , the strong dissymmetry in the @xmath123 and @xmath2 lifetimes is a direct proof of the importance of the vibrational coupling for the decay process of the polaritons , as well as of the non - markovian character of the associated relaxation .",
    "as also known for the lowest excited level of most molecules , @xmath110 has a very long lifetime precisely because the vibrational overlap between the lowest excited level and the ground state is much smaller than between it and the higher excited states .",
    "let us discuss here two examples .",
    "for merocyanine strongly coupled ( @xmath124ev ) to a fabry - perot cavity of low @xmath125factor ( @xmath126 ) , the half - life of @xmath127ps is much longer than the photon lifetime in the bare cavity ( @xmath128fs ) while being shorter than that of bare molecules ( @xmath129ps ) @xcite . in the case of the tdbc j - aggregate",
    "strongly coupled ( @xmath130ev ) to a similar low @xmath34 cavity , @xmath1 has a half - life of @xmath131ps , which is even longer than the @xmath132ps half - life of the bare organic material , as shown in fig.4 .",
    "note that these lifetime values are the same whether @xmath1 is excited resonantly or not . when the pump reaches higher electronic levels of uncoupled or coupled molecules , the same transient spectrum and lifetime are observed , confirming that @xmath1 determines the observable because the population accumulates in this longest - lived state .",
    "we also emphasize that for both types of molecules , the quantum yields in the strong coupling regime are remarkably low . indeed , for merocyanine , a highly efficient organic dye , the measured quantum yield associated with @xmath1 falls below @xmath133 @xcite . for tdbc , we measure a quantum yield @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "in fact , this can also be found by simply remembering that for molecules with high oscillator strength such as merocyanine and tdbc , the radiative rate is at best @xmath135s@xmath136 so that , given the observed @xmath1 life times of the order of picoseconds , quantum yields are expected to be less than @xmath137 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown in this paper that the observed lifetimes of the polariton states are naturally explained in the non - markovian relaxation approach studied in the present letter .",
    "the lifetimes of the excited states are determined by vibrational relaxation phenomena and they are strongly affected by the large rabi splitting which changes the overlaps of the vibrational reservoirs . in particular , the lifetime of the lower dressed state @xmath1 is much longer than that of other excited states and its value is disconnected from that of the photon decay rate in the bare cavity , or of the relaxation rates of bare molecular states .",
    "this explains the main features observed in experiments and also opens new possibilities to influence chemical dynamics by controlling organic strong coupling .",
    "the authors are grateful to claude cohen - tannoudji , james a. hutchison and jean - marie lehn for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was funded in part by the erc ( grant 227577 ) and the anr ( equipex union ) ."
