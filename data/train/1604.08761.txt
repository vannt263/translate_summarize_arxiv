    "magnetic equiatomic alloys ( meas ) of general formula mm@xmath6x ( m , m@xmath6 = transition metals , x = si , ge , sn etc . ) and their derivatives have attracted renewed attentions for the observation of fascinating magneto - functional and physical properties such as , large magneticaloric effect ( mce ) , exchange bias effect ( ebe ) , spin glass ( sg ) like ground state etc .",
    "@xcite among various members of meas , mnnige is one of the potential candidates which undergoes a first - order diffusionless structural phase transition , known as martensitic phase transition ( mpt ) , at 470 k during cooling and orders spiral antiferromagnetically below 346 k.  @xcite physical and chemical pressures are the two most influencing parameters that can affect the physical properties of these materials simply by modifying structural parameters like lattice volume , bond angle etc .",
    "@xcite among these two , chemical pressure approach ( different doping studies ) is much popular among the researchers due to easy sample preparation and measurement options .",
    "however , the purest form of perturbation can only be given by the physical pressure approach . since mea s discovery , several doping studies ( chemical pressure effect )",
    "have been performed to increase the magneto - functional properties by reducing the structural transition temperature below its magnetic transition .",
    "@xcite but very little efforts have been made to tune the magneto - functional properties by applying physical pressure on the mnnige system .",
    "@xcite recent investigation on the fe - doped mnnige alloy ( fe doping both in mn and ni sites of the alloy ) by liu _",
    "et al . _ indicates the presence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and sg - like ground state in the system .",
    "@xcite fe doping at the mn site of the mnnige layered compound not only breaks the spiral antiferromagnetic ( afm ) mn - ge - mn inter - layer interaction but also induces fm interaction between mn atoms of the same layer by reducing lattice volume of the alloy .",
    "@xcite in addition , a reasonable decrease in mpt temperature of the alloy has been observed with fe - doping .",
    "initial increase in fe - concentration ( up to 16% doping ) results enhancement of fm strength and hence the overall magnetic moment of the alloy .",
    "fm strength again starts to decrease with further increase in fe concentration and a sg like ground state was observed .",
    "@xcite the direct exchange nature of the mn - mn intra - layer interaction plays the pivotal role towards the observation of non - monotonic effect of fe - doping . in the present work ,",
    "our aim is to address the effect of clean perturbation by applying external hydrostatic pressure on the structural and magnetic transition of a fe - doped mnnige alloy with nominal composition mn@xmath0fe@xmath1nige .",
    "the polycrystalline sample of nominal composition mn@xmath0fe@xmath1nige was prepared by argon arc - melting the constituent elements ( purity @xmath7 99.9% ) . to make the alloy homogeneous ,",
    "the ingot was turned over and re - melted for four times .",
    "further the ingot was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and annealed at 800@xmath8c for 100 h followed by a rapid quenching in ice water .",
    "the sample was characterized by room temperature x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) measurement recorded in a bruker axs diffractometer ( d8-advance ) using cu k@xmath9 radiation .",
    "the collected powder diffraction pattern was used for the rietveld refinement analysis by maud software to obtain different structural parameters .",
    "@xcite rietveld refinement along with the xrd patterns of the studied sample are shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "xrd analysis confirms that at room temperature , the sample crystalizes with hexagonal ni@xmath10in - type structure ( space group @xmath11 ) .",
    "no noticeable contribution of any impurities has been detected in this pattern .",
    "the lattice parameters of the hexagonal phase are found to be @xmath12 = 4.081  , and @xmath13 = 5.327  .",
    "the important fitted parameters are @xmath14 = 2.4 , @xmath15 = 4.8% , and @xmath16 = 3.6 % . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the layered structure of hexagonal mn@xmath0fe@xmath1nige alloy at room temperature obtained by using vesta software package .",
    "the mn / fe , ni and ge atoms occupy 2a , 2d and 2c sites respectively .",
    "@xcite the dc magnetization ( @xmath17 ) was measured using a quantum design squid magnetometer ( mpms 7 , evercool model ) .",
    "high pressure measurements were performed using a mpms high pressure capsule cell 8.5 .",
    "daphne was used as pressure transferring medium .",
    "temperature ( @xmath18 ) variation of dc magnetization , measured at an applied magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) of 10 koe , both in field cooling ( fc ) and field - cooled heating ( fch ) protocols are depicted in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . during cooling , a sharp increase in the @xmath19 data around 200 k in association with a large thermal hysteresis between fc and fch data has been observed and consequently signify the occurrence of magneto - structural transition in the alloy .",
    "presence of thermal hysteresis confirms the first order nature of the transition .",
    "further decrease in temperature results a sluggish drop in @xmath17 value after reaching maximum just below the structural transition .",
    "the decreasing nature of @xmath19 data indicates the presence of a short range afm phase in the otherwise fm alloy . to shed more light on the magnetic nature of the sample",
    ", we recorded isothermal @xmath17 data as a function of @xmath4 at selected temperatures ( see inset of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "all the isothermal @xmath20 data were recorded during heating at different constant temperatures in a thermally demagnetized state .",
    "paramagnetic nature of the high temperature austenite phase is clear from the linear @xmath20 data at 250 k. however , closer view of the @xmath20 data reveals that , below and around mpt , there is a clear signature of change in slope in the @xmath20 isotherms around the low field region ( marked by @xmath21 ) .",
    "the isotherms at 200 k and 150 k , when the sample is well in the martensitic state , are associated with field induced afm to fm transition , which starts at @xmath21 and found to be completed at @xmath22 ( marked in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and the alloy becomes totally fm .",
    "similar behavior has also been observed at 5 k. both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are found to increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "this type of field induced transition from a spiral afm to canted fm state has already been reported for mnnige alloy .",
    "@xcite magnetic moment at 50 koe of applied @xmath4 is also found to increase with decreasing temperature of measurement .",
    "now , let us examine the effect of external hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath5 ) on the magnetic and magneto - functional properties of the studied alloy .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) depicts the @xmath18 variation of fc and fch magnetization data at 10 koe of @xmath4 in presence of different external @xmath5 .",
    "application of external @xmath5 has a drastic effect on the magnetic and magneto - structural properties of the alloy .",
    "mpt becomes broad and is found to be shifted towards lower @xmath18 side with increasing external @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , a closer look reveals that the mpt becomes a two step process with initial increase in @xmath5 up to 5 kbar .",
    "this may be due to the decoupling of magnetic and structural transitions in the alloy .",
    "further increase in @xmath5 results the merging of these two transitions again .",
    "this de - coupling and coupling process is very clearly visible in the @xmath23 vs. @xmath18 data depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "this observation is may be due to the faster response of structural transition than the magnetic transition .",
    "initial application of @xmath5 results a sharp decrease in structural transition temperature and gets saturated around 5 kbar of @xmath5 . on the other hand , magnetic transition temperature decreases slowly with increasing @xmath5 up to 12.5 kbar .",
    "monotonic decrease in magnetic transition temperature helped to couple these two transitions again .",
    "it is also clear from the @xmath19 data that the low-@xmath18 martensitic state is more sensitive to the external @xmath5 than the high-@xmath18 austenite phase .",
    "the magnetic moment in the low-@xmath18 martensitic state decreases with initial increase in @xmath5 , whilst @xmath17 starts to increase with further increase in @xmath5 .",
    "this anomalous behavior may be related to different fm and afm phase fractions present in various applied @xmath5 .",
    "this anomalous behavior was further investigated by recording isothermal @xmath20 data at 5 k in presence of different @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "a number of features are associated with these @xmath20 isotherms .",
    "firstly , the saturation magnetic moment at 50 koe of applied @xmath4 is found to decrease with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "about 25 emu / g decrease in @xmath17 has been observed for the application of 12.5 kbar of external @xmath5 .",
    "closer look at the low field region reveals that the hydrostatic pressure has a very significant effect on the field induced afm to fm transition present in the martensitic phase of the system .",
    "the low-@xmath4 region of the @xmath20 data indicates that the starting field @xmath21 of the field induced transition remains almost constant with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , the saturation field @xmath22 , where this field induced transition finishes , decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the nature of the @xmath20 curves suggest that the afm phase fraction decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "reduced saturation moment with enhancement of @xmath5 is observed only due to the decrease in the in - plane mn - mn direct exchange interaction ( by decreasing mn - mn intra layer distance ) and hence fm strength . similar decrease in saturation moment at 5 k",
    "has also been observed with the increase of chemical pressure ( fe doping in the present case ) beyond certain level .",
    "@xcite up to 16% of fe doping , a clear increase in the saturation moment has been observed . whilst , further increase in fe concentration results a decrease in saturation moment .",
    "the presently studied alloy is a 15% fe doped alloy , which is very near to the composition with maximum moment , and shows similar behavior with external hydrostatic pressure as that of the chemical pressure .",
    "tempted by the observation of strong hydrostatic pressure effect on the magnetic properties of the presently studied alloy , we have investigated different magneto - functional properties in presence of different external @xmath5 .",
    "the mm@xmath24x alloys are popular for their large magneto - caloric effect ( mce ) .",
    "change in entropy ( @xmath2 ) on application of external @xmath4 is a measure of mce , and it is often calculated from the magnetization data using maxwell s relation ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denotes the entropy change for the change in @xmath4 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .  @xcite it is important to be very much careful while calculating @xmath2 around first order phase transition by using maxwell s relation .",
    "discontinuity of @xmath17 around the ideal first order phase transition may give rise to infinite value of @xmath29 and hence unphysical value of @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite no such discontinuity has been observed for the present alloy around or below the transition [ resulting finite value of @xmath29 ] and hence allows us to use the maxwell s relation for the present alloy .    for @xmath2 calculation ,",
    "different @xmath20 isotherms were recorded during heating between 50 - 300 k with 5 k interval in thermally demagnetized state ( data with 1 k interval were recorded around the transition temperature ) .",
    "this specific state was obtained by cooling the sample from room temperature to 5 k and then heated back to the respective temperature of measurements in zero magnetic field .",
    "these @xmath20 data were then convoluted to obtain @xmath19 data at different constant @xmath4 . finally , the change in entropy due to the application of @xmath4 has been calculated ( by using equation 1 ) and depicted in fig .  [ fig4](a ) .",
    "the magnetic entropy change @xmath2 is found to be -21 j / kg - k for @xmath4 changing from 0 to 50 koe .",
    "negative value of @xmath2 indicates that the observed mce for the present alloy is of conventional type .",
    "the above process was repeated for different external @xmath5 to examine its effect on mce .",
    "application of external @xmath5 results decrease in mce value with a clear shift of the peak position towards lower @xmath18 .",
    "about 18 j / kg - k decrease in @xmath2 has been observed on application of 12.5 kbar of external @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , a clear split in @xmath2 vs. @xmath18 curve has been observed with initial application of @xmath5 up to 5 kbar .",
    "the mce curve again becomes a single peak structure on further increase in @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior also supports the de - coupling and coupling of magnetic and structural transition observed in @xmath19 data ( hence @xmath23 vs. @xmath18 data ) .",
    "for the development of mce based refrigerator , beside the peak value of @xmath2 one has to look for it s refrigeration capacity ( rc ) also .",
    "rc for a sample is defined as rc = @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the source and sink temperatures respectively .",
    "@xcite we have calculated rc for the present alloy in ambient condition as well as in presence of external @xmath5 . in ambient condition",
    "rc value is 218 j / kg for @xmath4 changing from 0 to 50 koe . on the other hand , in presence of 12.5 kbar of external @xmath5 rc",
    "is found to be 173 j / kg .",
    "the rc values observed for the present alloy both in ambient and high pressure conditions are reasonably high and can be used for practical applications .",
    "as the effect of external @xmath5 is similar to that of chemical doping ( chemical pressure ) observed from the magnetization data , the afm and fm interaction present in the alloy may become comparable with increasing @xmath5 which often gives rise to exchange bias effect ( ebe ) as observed in a 20% fe doped alloy .",
    "@xcite ebe is defined as the shift in the center of the @xmath20 isotherm while cooled in presence of external @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite ebe is particularly important because of its application in various technological fields , such as permanent magnets , magnetic recording media , sensors , and read heads .",
    "@xcite different magnetic interfaces like , fm / afm , fm / sg and fm / ferrimagnet based multilayers play the pivotal role towards the observation of ebe .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the ebe of the presently studied alloy by recording isothermal @xmath20 data at 5 k after cooling the sample from 300 k in presence of 500 oe cooling field ( @xmath34 ) at different @xmath5 as depicted in the main panel and upper inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ( only @xmath5 = 0 , 5 and 12.5 kbar data are plotted here for clarity ) .",
    "all the @xmath35 isotherms were recorded between @xmath3650 koe , which is well above the technical saturation field of the sample and rules out the possibility of minor loop effect towards the observation of ebe . however",
    ", a restricted range of @xmath362.5 koe is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) for proper visualization .",
    "the zero field cooled @xmath35 isotherms are found to be perfectly symmetric with respect to the origin on both horizontal ( @xmath4 ) and vertical ( @xmath17 ) axes ( see fig .  [ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "the field cooled @xmath20 isotherm remains symmetrical at ambient condition ( see upper inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "this indicates the absence of any ebe in the alloy . on the other hand ,",
    "a clear shift in the centre of the hysteresis loop , both in @xmath4 and @xmath17 axis , has been observed in presence of external @xmath5 .",
    "variation of shift in the field axis @xmath37 as function of external @xmath5 has been plotted in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "a monotonic increase in the @xmath37 value has been observed with increasing @xmath5 value .",
    "this pressure induced ebe is in line with the fact that the application of external pressure results decrease in intra layer mn - mn fm interaction and makes it comparable with the inter layer mn - mn afm interaction .",
    "our magnetic studies of the mn@xmath0fe@xmath1nige alloy under different applied hydrostatic pressure ( clean perturbation ) bring out several fascinating physical and functional properties of the system .",
    "initial application of @xmath5 results broadening and splitting of magneto - structural transition along with a clear decrease in the transition temperature .",
    "further increase in external @xmath5 results merging of magnetic and structural transitions .",
    "this de - coupling and coupling of magnetic and structural transitions is one of the unique features observed in the presently studied alloy .",
    "unequal response of magnetic and structural transitions towards the external @xmath5 plays the pivotal role towards this observation . on the other hand , application of @xmath5 affects mn - mn intra - layer direct exchange interaction and hence considerable decrease in the saturation moment at 5 k has been observed with increasing @xmath5 . in addition , a clear decrease in technical saturation field has also been observed with increasing @xmath5 . apart from these physical properties , external hydrostatic pressure also has a strong effect on the magneto - functional properties of the alloy .",
    "the large conventional mce observed for the present alloy in ambient condition decreases and the peak temperature found to be shifted towards the lower temperature with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the most important observation is the occurrence of ebe in presence of external @xmath5 .",
