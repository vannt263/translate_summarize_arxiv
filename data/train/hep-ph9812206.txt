    "the inclusive production of soft photons in particle collisions at high energies has been studied in several experiments @xcite using various experimental techniques .    in a pioneering bubble chamber experiment performed at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) , goshaw _",

    "using their own data about hadronic final states they showed that the bremsstrahlung formula of classical electrodynamics @xcite was able to account for all the observed photon yield .",
    "a few years later , the experimental group led by yves goldschmidt - clermont @xcite investigated the photon production in 70  gev/@xmath1 @xmath5 collisions using the big european bubble chamber ( bebc ) at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "in contrast to the observation of the slac experiment they found many more photons with very small longitudinal momentum ( @xmath6 ) than they expected on the basis of the classical bremsstrahlung formula and their charged hadron production data . similarly , the unpublished @xcite photon transverse momentum spectrum from the same experiment exhibited a significant excess over the bremsstrahlung estimate for @xmath7 60 mev/@xmath1 .",
    "the results obtained by the axial field spectrometer ( afs ) collaboration at the cern intersecting storage rings ( isr ) @xcite were in conformity with both previous experiments .",
    "they neither required an additional source to explain the observed photon signal , nor excluded an anomalous component of the size indicated by the bebc experiment .",
    "but they did rule out a strong increase of anomalous photon production with rising collision energy ( the invariant energy @xmath8 in the afs experiment was 63 gev , compared to 11.5 gev in the bebc experiment ) .    in a subsequent afs experiment @xcite ,",
    "the direct photon production was studied in @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions at @xmath11  gev .",
    "the photon momentum range explored ( 0.1  gev/@xmath12  gev/@xmath1 ) does not overlap the range in this paper ( @xmath13  gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is the reason why we will not include these data in our comparison .",
    "let us only note that the results of @xcite did not show any excess beyond the limits dominated by systematic uncertainties .",
    "the inclusive yield of photons from deep inelastic @xmath14 scattering at 200 gev was measured by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) at the cern sps @xcite . after subtracting the contributions from hadron",
    "electromagnetic decays and bethe - heitler muon bremsstrahlung , residual photons were observed at a mean level of @xmath15 per event .",
    "the first results of the helios ( na34 ) experiment at the cern sps @xcite on soft photon production in @xmath16-be and @xmath16-al interactions at 450 gev/@xmath1 indicated a marked excess in the region 4  mev/@xmath17 20  mev/@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the yield seemed to increase approximately as the square of the associated hadron multiplicity , which would have signified a collective production mechanism @xcite .",
    "these findings were not confirmed by a more extensive later experiment  @xcite by some members of the same group .    in the experiment performed by the ehs - na22 collaboration @xcite at the cern sps ,",
    "the european hybrid spectrometer ( ehs ) was equipped with the rapid cycling bubble chamber ( rcbc ) as vertex detector .",
    "the inclusive soft photon production was studied in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions at 250 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the results confirmed the existence of an anomalous prompt photon signal with very similar properties as seen in the bebc experiment @xcite .",
    "the sophie / wa83 experiment @xcite , which was performed at the cern sps , used the omega spectrometer supplemented with two electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "it differed in three important respects from the previous two hadronic collision experiments @xcite that saw the anomalous soft photon signal .",
    "first , it used a beam of negative particles ( pions with momentum of 280 gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "second , it was a purely electronic experiment without utilizing a bubble chamber .",
    "third , it explored a kinematic region where the contribution of gammas from hadronic decays is relatively small .",

    "@xcite used a modified setup of the helios experiment @xcite and measured the inclusive @xmath18 spectra of soft photons produced at central and slightly backward rapidities in 450 gev/@xmath1 @xmath16-be collisions .",
    "two independent photon measurement methods with corresponding detectors and analysis chains were used in parallel : ( i ) a combination of gas chambers , converter plates and a bgo matrix for the conversion method ; ( ii ) a baf@xmath19 array for the time of flight photon identification method .",
    "the authors of @xcite observed a significant excess of direct photons at very low @xmath18 ( @xmath20  mev/@xmath1 ) above the background from hadronic decays .",
    "this excess was consistent with the expected contribution from hadronic bremsstrahlung , calculated from the classical electrodynamics formula @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the results of the emc photon experiment @xcite were described @xcite using the soft annihilation model @xcite .",
    "some discrepancy between experimental and theoretical spectra stimulated the creation of the modified soft annihilation model @xcite , which allowed , contrary to the original model , also gluons in the intermediate parton state .",
    "we will present this model in some detail in sec .",
    "every attempt to explain the photon excess seen in the bebc experiment @xcite on the same footing remained unsuccessful .    to our knowledge , the first theoretical article that addressed the issue of very soft anomalous photons @xcite was that by van  hove @xcite .",
    "he offered a common explanation of several ultrasoft phenomena observed experimentally in central rapidity regions of high energy collisions .",
    "these phenomena are characterized by very low transverse momenta ( production of soft pions or photons ) or very short distances in rapidity ( fluctuations in rapidity distributionintermittency \" ) .",
    "van hove argued that they could be regarded as manifestations of the occurrence , in at least some of the collisions , of an intermediate parton system with considerable lifetime and spatial extension .",
    "this system carries only a part of the collision energy and momentum and the rest of the event is  standard \" .",
    "the most natural framework for understanding the production mechanism and properties of such a system is provided by the qcd parton shower model @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that the shower development stops when parton virtualities fall to @xmath21 gev .",
    "the partons with this virtuality are supposed to enter the hadronization process .",
    "van hove proposed that some of them may continue in showering , producing a large multiplicity ( @xmath22 ) system of very soft partons , a glob of cold quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the intermediate parton system consists of one or several globs with masses @xmath23 gev/@xmath24 . as discussed in  @xcite , globs need much time to hadronize , because hadronization requires a very drastic rearrangement of partonic wave functions . during their long lifetime , globs can produce photons in the subprocesses @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a quantitative model for soft photon production based on the van  hove ideas @xcite was constructed and successfully compared to the bebc data @xcite by him and the present author in  @xcite .",
    "barshay @xcite investigated the role of pion condensation @xcite in soft photon production .",
    "he showed that this collective coherent mechanism implied that the photon emission was proportional to the square of the associated pion multiplicity . at that time , this feature seemed to be indicated by the preliminary helios data @xcite .",
    "shuryak @xcite showed that the backward reflection of pions at the boundary of a hadronic system , induced by the modification of the pion dispersion curve by many - particle interactions , strongly increases soft photon emission .",
    "a complex view of the dense interacting pion matter was presented in the subsequent work @xcite together with the implications for experimentally observed phenomena .",
    "the photon yield was calculated by applying the classical bremsstrahlung formula along the paths of many times rescattered pions . as stated in the original paper  @xcite",
    ", this approach could not describe the observed excess of real photons at low transverse momenta .",
    "v.  balek , n.  pitov , and j.  pit @xcite ( a more detailed discussion of some issues can be found in their later papers : @xcite in collaboration with zinovjev , and @xcite ) , first briefly reviewed experimental information on , and theoretical understanding of the production of very soft photons .",
    "then they studied some effects which were not considered in the bremsstrahlung calculation of the helios collaboration @xcite and found them very small .",
    "they also suggested two photon production mechanisms : 1 ) shock waves in the system of final state hadrons , 2 ) bremsstrahlung emitted by a quark that tries to escape from the intermediate parton system .",
    "they concluded that none of them could explain the soft photon anomaly observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "czy and florkowski @xcite used the classical bremsstrahlung formula to calculate soft photon emission within the framework of the boost - invariant color - flux tube model @xcite .",
    "the ratio of their photon production rate to the classical one depends strongly on the direction of the photon and is very sensitive to the assumed mass of quarks . for photons emitted perpendicular to the collision axis and @xmath27",
    "mev/@xmath24 it can reach 10 . the strong angular dependence is a feature that saliently distinguishes this model from the essentially isotropic glob model @xcite .",
    "only a few of the theoretical approaches mentioned above have attempted to make a detailed comparison with actual experimental data , including the very important and delicate matter of experimental acceptance and cuts .",
    "while technical and experimental problems are substantial , an important problem in assessing the reality of the anomalous photon production is that the experiments have been performed under very different conditions .",
    "the varied experimental conditions have included different projectiles and targets , different collision energies , different instrumental setups with different photon momentum coverage and acceptances .",
    "so it is very difficult to say whether they are consistent among themselves or not , whether they witness about the same phenomenon , whether their contradictory claims are really significantly inconsistent . in this complicated situation",
    "we see only one way of pursuing the matter : to use some theoretical model as a tool for connecting various experiments .",
    "the guiding idea is that if a model is able , after modulated by the experimental acceptances , to describe several pieces of data without tuning its parameters for each particular case , then the data are mutually consistent .",
    "it may also indicate that the model is physically sound , but this need not always be the case .",
    "the model may simply simulate an important conventional contribution which was not properly taken into account in every experimental analysis considered .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to assess the consistency of various data on soft photon production in hadronic interactions by using the glob model @xcite and the modified soft annihilation model @xcite as interpolation tools .    in the next section",
    ", we deal with the glob model of van hove and the present author .",
    "we first recapitulate its assumptions and equations , as well as the way its parameters were chosen",
    ". then we develop a simpler , but physically equivalent mutation of the glob model , which will be used throughout this paper .",

    "conclusions are summarized and commented upon in sec .",
    "[ comments ] , where we also discuss the possible relation of anomalous soft photon production to other phenomena .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ intro ] , we assume that in some percentage of high - energy inelastic collisions , a long - living , large , and dense system consisting of light quarks , antiquarks , and gluons is formed . for the physical parameters of such a system , called glob , we will use the original estimates @xcite : the glob mass @xmath28 gev/@xmath24 ; the number of partons within a glob @xmath29 ; the gluon / parton number ratio = 0.5 ; and the light quark number ratio @xmath30 .",
    "because of the fixed invariant energy , the momentum distribution of partons is governed by the microcanonical distribution .",
    "the mean number @xmath31 of photons emitted by a glob is therefore given by the expression @xmath32^{1/2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\frac{\\sigma_{ij}(s_{ij})}{e_ie_j}\\delta\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^ { n_p } e_k - m\\right)\\delta\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n_p}{\\bf p}_k\\right ) \\prod_{k=1}^{n_p}\\frac{d^3p_k}{e_k},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the momentum of the @xmath34th parton in the glob rest frame and @xmath35 is the cross section for photon production in head - on collisions of the @xmath36th and @xmath37th parton .",

    ", we arrive at the equation that served in @xcite as the master equation for a monte carlo generator of the photon momenta in the glob rest frame .",
    "to transform the photon momentum from the glob rest frame to the collision center - of - mass frame , we need to know the glob momentum distribution in the latter . in @xcite",
    "it was assumed that the distribution in the glob rapidity and transverse momentum squared @xmath44 with the function @xmath45 normalized to unity , factorizes . to proceed further , a gaussian glob rapidity distribution with the width proportional to the maximum cms rapidity ( i.e. @xmath46 )",

    "it was suggested in @xcite to scale the mean number of globs @xmath52 according to empirically known hadron multiplicity .",
    "the first numerical realization of the glob model @xcite , which we have just briefly sketched , had serious disadvantages . with @xmath59",
    "fixed at 40 , the dimension of the integral which was to be evaluated by the monte carlo method was 120 .",
    "determination of a detailed distribution in photon momentum with low statistical errors thus became a computer - time - consuming task . also the computer code was complicated and difficult to use .",
    "it was practically impossible to use the glob model as an event generator for monte carlo studies of experimental setups . in the next subsection",
    "we remove these drawbacks of the original glob model @xcite and suggest a computing scheme which is easy to reproduce .      in the glob model it is assumed that the internal properties of the glob ( total invariant energy of partons @xmath60 , their number @xmath59 , as well as their momentum and flavor distributions ) depend neither on the type of process under study nor on the incident energy .",
    "this allows us to construct a new version of the glob model , which is physically equivalent to the original one , but much easier to use .",
    "the invariant photon distribution in a general reference frame can be written as a convolution of the photon distribution in the glob rest frame with the momentum distribution of globs in the general frame @xmath61 the asterisk refers to quantities in the glob rest frame and @xmath62 according to the basic assumptions of the glob model , the photon momenta are distributed isotropically in the glob rest frame .",

    "its parameters are therefore fixed by data on the production of hadrons @xcite . in 1981 ,",
    "sam was compared @xcite to all the dilepton data available at that time and appeared to be in satisfactory agreement with them .",

    "the comparison of sam ( with the subprocess @xmath74 ) to the emc photon data was not without flaws either .",
    "both longitudinal and transverse spectra ( in the hadronic system rest frame ) were flatter than the experimental one @xcite . to bring the calculations closer to reality",
    ", a gluon component was introduced into the ips in the modified soft annihilation model @xcite together with corresponding subprocesses @xmath75 and @xmath76 . with the quark and antiquark multiplicities fixed at the same values as in sam ( in order not to change outgoing hadron multiplicities ) , the mean energies of partons became smaller , which also made the spectra of dileptons and photons softer .",
    "this improved the agreement not only with the results of @xcite and @xcite , but also with some older dilepton data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for technical details of the model , which we will use also in this work .",
    "let us only note that the model , when applied to soft photon production , does not contain any free parameters . for each projectile , target , and incident energy combination ,",

    "they are those listed in the introduction except for the afs @xcite and anto _ et al . _ @xcite experiments .    in paper @xcite ,",
    "the afs collaboration presented the @xmath18-spectrum of photons observed in @xmath9 collisions at @xmath77  gev ( their fig .",

    "the latter were , in turn , given in terms of ratios to the @xmath78 yields ( afs fig .",
    "the comparison of models to their results would be possible , but would require the recall of information from other experiments and the inclusion of the afs efficiences and acceptance .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the afs collaboration found their data compatible with the other data known at the time @xcite , which will be explored here in detail .",
    "we would be unlikely to add much to their statement even if we compared @xcite with our models .    with the data of anto _",

    "they seem to be incompatible with all the experiments that have reported the existence of the soft photon anomaly .",

    ", more detailed and statistically more precise results of the simplified version of the glob model can now be combined with the other independent sources of photons ( msam , bremsstrahlung calculated by experimentalists on the basis of empirical charged hadron distributions or hadron production models ) producing a total theoretical expectation .",
    "the latter is then compared to the experimental data .",
    "we can thus also determine the basic parameter of the glob model @xmath79 more reliably .",

    "the present value of @xmath69 , which is 0.7 times the value used in @xcite , was chosen to give good agreement of the theoretical @xmath83-spectra not only with the bebc results , but also with the data @xcite on prompt photon production in @xmath84 and @xmath4 interactions at 250 gev/@xmath1 ( see below ) .",
    "the reader has certainly noticed that the msam curve is not shown in fig .",

    "[ figure2 ] and over a wider range it resembles the spectrum of photons from @xmath85 decays ( not shown ) .",
    "it was the virtue of the experimental procedure used in @xcite for isolating the anomalous component in the @xmath83-spectrum that the photons with a spectrum similar to that from the @xmath85 decays were subtracted from the total yield . in this way",

    "in @xcite it was suggested that it should be done according to the mean hadron multiplicity .",
    "but we feel that at this very low energy ( @xmath91  gev ) this is inadequate . due to the energy - momentum constraints it is much more difficult to produce a glob with mass 1  gev in addition to a baryon in the final state than a pion ( pions account for most of the produced multiplicity ) with a mass roughly seven times smaller .",
    "the dependence of @xmath52 on the collision energy should be , at small energies , much steeper than that of overall hadron multiplicity and should behave more like , let us say , the mean multiplicity of centrally produced @xmath92(1020 ) s .",
    "guided by the experimental results on the production of the latter in @xmath9 collisions ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 in @xcite ) , we assume that the glob multiplicity at 10.5  gev/@xmath1 is three times smaller than that at 70 gev/@xmath1 . in this way",
    "we mimic the threshold effect which must exist in the production of globs in low - energy collisions . scaling according to the ratio of",
    "produced charged hadron multiplicities in 70  gev/@xmath1 @xmath5 and 10.5  gev/@xmath1 @xmath4 collisions would lead to a decrease by a little smaller factor of 2.1 .",

    "we can thus conclude that even if the results of the slac experiment @xcite do not require any additional mechanism rather than classical bremsstrahlung , they do not exclude an additional contribution of the size given by the glob model .",

    "keeping in mind the inevitably large experimental errors ( each data point was obtained as a difference of two big numbers  the total yield minus the calculated yield from the radiative decays of hadrons ) , theoretical curves scaled down by a factor of , say , @xmath105 would be also acceptable .    in figs .",
    "[ figure9 ] and [ figure10 ] , the measured inclusive differential cross sections in transverse momentum are presented together with the classical bremsstrahlung estimate made by experimenters , two model curves , and a sum of these three components . for both @xmath5 and @xmath4 initial states",
    ", the theoretical expectation does not match the data very well .",
    "it is below the data for ultrasoft photons ( @xmath106 mev/@xmath1 ) and overshoots the data in the medium region ( 10  mev/@xmath107  mev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "the former feature is common with other hadronic experiments and will be discussed later .",
    "the latter may have several origins .",
    "first of all , the procedure of extrapolations to different collision energies suggested in @xcite may be unreliable .",
    "this interpretation is somewhat called into question by the good agreement with the results of the wa83/sophie experiment @xcite ( see below ) , which was done at even a slightly higher collision energy ( @xmath108  gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "another reason may lie in our inadequate simulation of experimental conditions . besides the energy cut mentioned above , the experimenters introduced several others in an effort to minimize systematic errors .",
    "the latter would be very difficult to implement in our model calculations , because such a task would require a detailed knowledge about the experimental setup and a model for the conversion of photons to electrons in the metal foils placed inside the rapid cycling bubble chamber .",
    "we are not , of course , able to assess here how reliably it was possible to correct for all those cuts , and to what extent they persist in the final experimental distributions .",
    "there is another important issue to be discussed in connection with the paper @xcite . in their figs .",
    "7a , b and 8a , b , the authors of @xcite show the predictions of the glob model , which differ a little from what we presented here .",
    "in fact , their model histograms are lower than our curves and provide a better description of differential cross sections in @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , the model predictions in @xcite were obtained under oversimplified assumptions .",
    "the model histograms @xcite for @xmath5 collisions at 70  gev/@xmath1 were only multiplied by the ratios of total inelastic cross sections at 250 and 70 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the authors of @xcite thus neglected the change of mean glob multiplicity with the collision energy and assumed that the form of distributions is collision - energy independent , @xmath83 and @xmath18 were treated as  scaling variables \" .",
    "the high statistics study @xcite of direct soft photon production in @xmath109 collisions at 280 gev/@xmath1 was based on a sample of 310,390 events observed in the apparatus consisting of the omega spectrometer and two electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "the results are given in the numbers of photons per bin in the variable under consideration ( @xmath18 or @xmath110 ) .",
    "the numbers have been corrected for the @xmath111 detection efficiency , but no attempt has been made to correct for the geometrical acceptance and extract the differential cross sections . generally speaking , for experiments with a non - trivial geometrical acceptance that covers only a part of the phase space ,",
    "such a way of presenting results is least biased and therefore most valuable @xcite .",
    "any attempt to go beyond it would require some assumptions about either the production mechanism or the photon distribution in inaccessible phase - space regions . in order to compare a model with data , one has to modulate theoretical distributions with experimental acceptance .",
    "we took full advantage of the possibilities provided by the simplified version of the glob model and merged it with a program that described the geometrical acceptance of the wa83 experiment in order to calculate the same sort of distributions as shown in @xcite .",
    "such a project would be very difficult to accomplish with a very inefficient photon generator based on the original version .",
    "for msam , the acceptance modulated calculations do not represent a novelty @xcite .",
    "the photon transverse momentum spectra from models are compared to the experimental one in fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] .",
    "again , a reasonable agreement has been achieved for @xmath0 mev/@xmath1 .",
    "the transition from the glob model to msam is now located at @xmath112 mev/@xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting that the size of the classical bremsstrahlung is roughly equal to that of the model which just dominates .",
    "the excess of data over the total theoretical expectation in the ultrasoft region ( @xmath106  mev/@xmath1 ) is huge , about sevenfold for the lowest data point .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the experiment measured the photon production in @xmath16be interactions at 450 gev/@xmath1 . for those who want to compare its results with theoretical estimates , the missing absolute normalization is an obstacle .",
    "j.  schukraft , member of both the helios collaboration @xcite and the experimental group @xcite , suggested to us to fix the model normalization by comparing the bremsstrahlung estimates in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of similarities between the two apparatus , they should be identical . but the former is given in terms of the double differential cross section , the latter in  arbitrary units \" .",
    "this allowed us to recalculate the cross sections provided by models to the  arbitrary units \" of the experiment @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we used the be results of fig .  13 from the schukraft presentation at the quark matter 88 conference @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure12 ] shows the @xmath18 distribution of photons produced with zero rapidity in the cms of proton - nucleon center - of - mass system after subtraction of the decay background .",
    "the data taken by both detection methods are shown .",
    "the systematic errors of the data , the decay background and the bremsstrahlung calculation are not reproduced from the original fig .",
    "5a to keep our figure uncluttered .",
    "the total theoretical expectation agrees nicely with the results from the baf@xmath19 detector and is compatible , taking into account the large systematic errors , with the bgo array results . in the kinematic region of the experiment @xcite",
    ", the msam contributes very little .",
    "the glob model provides the most important contibution in the medium region 8  mev/@xmath113  mev/@xmath1 .",
    "there is practically no excess in data over the theoretical expectation in the ultrasoft region .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that in the prompt photon production it is useful to distinguish among three different kinematical regions :        \\(3 ) soft , characterized by @xmath115  mev/@xmath1 . + of the various components that we included in our phenomenological approach , the classical bremsstrahlung formula is invincible in the ultrasoft region . in the very soft region ,",
    "the main contribution to the total theoretical expectation comes from the glob model @xcite .",
    "the yield from the modified soft annihilation model @xcite peaks somewhere beyond the range explored by the hadronic experiments considered here and is therefore the only theoretical component which rises with @xmath18 . whether and where it will be above the remaining two components ( classical bremsstrahlung and glob model ) depends on the incident energy and the setup of the experiment .",
    "but it usually dominates in the soft region .",
    "the experimental data is mixed , with some experiments showing a much larger excess over the hadronic decay background than expected from their classical bremsstrahlung calculation , and other experiments claiming agreement between the excess and bremsstrahlung .",
    "the main result of this work is that , for all the experiments the observed @xmath83- and @xmath18- distributions of direct photons are reasonably well described above @xmath116  mev/@xmath1 ( that is except for the ultrasoft transverse momentum region ) , by a mixture consisting of the classical bremsstrahlung calculation ( taken from original experimental papers ) and two theoretical models .",
    "the latter are detailed enough to include experimental cuts and acceptances .",
    "the rules for extrapolating them to different energies have clearly been stated beforehand . on the basis of agreement of all data with the theoretical expectation ,",
    "we conclude that all the experimental data ( except for the @xmath18-distributions in the ultrasoft region ) on anomalous soft photon production are mutually consistent .",
    "it should be stressed that the magnitudes of different components in the phenomenological mixture did not come out as a result of fitting the experimental data , but are given as an interplay between their physics properties and experimental conditions ( incident energy , instrumental cuts and acceptances ) .",
    "the actual numbers may be very different in different cases .",
    "for example , in the @xmath18 distribution from the bebc experiment @xcite , the maximum glob / bremsstrahlung ratio is almost seven ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] ) , whereas in the @xmath16be collisions at 450  gev/@xmath1 @xcite , it does not exceed four ( fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] ) , and is able to squeeze into the empirical upper limits of direct photons provided by the baf@xmath19 method in @xcite ( their fig .",
    "6 ) . in the former experiment ,",
    "the msam gives the dominant contribution for @xmath117  mev/@xmath1 , but is below the bremsstrahlung up to the highest @xmath18 s in fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] . in the wa83/sophie experiment @xcite ,",
    "the size of bremsstrahlung in the very soft and soft regions is roughly equal to that of the dominating model ( glob or msam , see fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] ) .",
    "let us turn now to the ultrasoft region , where some experiments agree with the theoretical expectation ( completely dominated and therefore represented here exclusively by the classical bremsstrahlung formula ) , whereas others see a significant excess .",
    "while the delicacy of the experiments is underlined by the juxtaposition of the early helios @xcite results and those of @xcite , and the differing results could lie in differing experimental techniques , the apparent contradiction between the experiments might also be due to different underlying physics conditions . without any theory or model able to describe the anomalous excess ,",
    "the field is open to speculations . here",
    "is one possibility :    the data seem to suggest ( compare figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] , [ figure9 ] , [ figure10 ] , [ figure11 ] , and [ figure12 ] ) that the ultrasoft excess decreases with increasing mass of the projectile .",
    "there is one experiment that seems to contradict this suggestion : the historically first photon experiment @xcite , which did not see anything anomalous with pions .",
    "but let us recall that this is the only experiment which used , besides the laboratory energy cut @xmath94  gev , also the cut on the longitudinal photon momentum in the cms @xmath118 .",
    "the combination of those two cuts suppresses the yield of low-@xmath18 photons , especially if they are produced in a narrow cone around the projectile momentum .",
    "so the absence of the excess in this case need not mean its true nonexistence .",
    "the regularity above may imply that the excess is caused by bremsstrahlung from the projectile experiencing a ( multiple ) small - angle scattering .",
    "if we ignore instrumental effects ( residual gas , thick target , stray photons from background interactions ) , we can think , e.g. , about ( multiple ) soft gluon exchange between projectile and target before the hard , multiparticle production interaction takes place .",
    "of course , there is still a possibility that the experimenters who saw the excess significantly greater than the classical bremsstrahlung in the ultrasoft region neglected some important conventional contribution .    in the context of the ultrasoft region , it must be also noted that the classical bremsstrahlung formula @xcite , which was used by all experimenters to assess the expected level of photon production , is a big unknown .",
    "it has been shown a long time ago that it should be valid also in the quantum world in the limit of negligibly small photon momenta .",
    "it enables one to estimate the photon yield if the cross section of the corresponding nonradiative reaction is known . for higher photon energies ,",
    "the non - leading terms in the low expansion @xcite become important .",
    "but they can not be evaluated without a more detailed knowledge of the underlying strong dynamics of the collisions .",
    "it is not clear what is the region of validity of the classical approximation . in some examples ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , it is very narrow .    as already stated in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , the agreement of the models with experimental data need not imply that the mechanisms of photon productions they are based on are real .",
    "but let us assume for a moment that the models we used in this work are more than a clever parametrization of all existing data , that they explain the very origin of additional photons .",
    "we can then go beyond mere phenomenology and address , at least qualitatively , two important issues , which may have experimental implications .",
    "the first remark concerns the dependence of the prompt photon yield on the associated hadron multiplicity .",
    "the prediction @xcite of faster than linear dependence in dilepton production , and the experiment that seemed to observe it @xcite evoked a false impression that this effect must take place wherever an anomalous electromagnetic signal is encountered . as discussed in more detail in @xcite ( and , to some extent , already in @xcite ) , the actual behavior depends on the production mechanism . we expect a roughly linear dependence if the dominant mechanism is bremsstrahlung and faster than linear dependence for the ( modified ) soft annihilation model @xcite . in the case of photon production from the glob model , the intermediate parton system represents only a part of the event and most of the final state hadrons do not originate from it .",
    "we therefore expect no correlation between the very soft photon production rate and the associated hadron multiplicity .",
    "let us also note that a simultaneous observation of two ( or more ) ultrasoft effects would be a nice confirmation of van hove s glob mechanism @xcite .",
    "it may manifest itself , for example , by stronger short - range correlations among pions in events with very soft photons .",
