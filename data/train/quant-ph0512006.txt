    "a tremendous number of experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics employ state - selective atom - detection methods .",
    "an overview of the various detection techniques can be found in @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these schemes are based on the interaction of atoms with laser light that excites an atomic resonance @xcite .",
    "the atoms manifest themselves by absorption , emission and dispersion of radiation .",
    "all of these effects can be observed .",
    "however , for moving atoms , the number of scattered photons is usually too small to discriminate the presence of a single one .",
    "the situation is different for trapped ions or atoms , where a closed transition between two energy levels can be excited . in this case , the atom cycles between two levels and spontaneously emits photons at a constant rate .",
    "this allows one to detect individual particles , provided the interaction time with the exciting laser is long enough .",
    "such schemes have been demonstrated successfully in several experiments , where either a single or a small number of atoms was observed in a dipole trap or a magneto - optical trap @xcite , or a single ion in a paul - trap @xcite .",
    "even single molecules in solvents and solids have been detected in this way , since their relaxation rate to the ground state is so fast that they can emit more than one photon while they are observed @xcite .",
    "for freely moving atoms , detection methods are more sophisticated .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that a single atom s dispersion is sufficient to switch the transmission of a high - finesse fabry - perot type optical cavity when it travels through the cavity mode @xcite . moreover , the purcell - enhanced emission into a cavity has been used to trace single atoms @xcite , and also to deterministically generate single photons from a single atom located in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "although these cavity - qed based methods are very elegant and effective , they are experimentally hard to implement .",
    "other methods to detect a moving atom are often based on the release of a large amount of internal energy .",
    "this applies , in particular , to metastable atoms or ions .",
    "however , the detection is destructive and does rarely allow one to determine the inner state of the particle . only the extension to a multi - step detection method , like resonance - enhanced multi - photon ionization @xcite , enables one to detect individual particles in a state - selective manner . in this article , we focus on laser - induced fluorescence which allows us to monitor individual , freely falling atoms in a time - resolved and state - selective manner .",
    "the atoms are released from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and arrive at the detector in free fall with a velocity of @xmath1 m/s .",
    "the motion of the atoms limits the interaction time with the exciting laser beam to about 60@xmath2s . within this time interval ,",
    "a significant number of photons is recorded from every atom , so that its presence can be discriminated from the background noise .",
    "this is achieved with a highly efficient collection system for the emitted photons .",
    "as spontaneous emission is not directed , an efficient detector must cover a large solid angle to collect a significant amount of fluorescence photons .",
    "our collection optics resembles the one that has been developed for the spectroscopic detection of fast molecules @xcite .",
    "figure [ mirror ] shows our setup , which is a combination of an ellipsoidal and a spherical coated aluminium mirror .",
    "it covers a solid angle close to @xmath3 , provided the atoms fluoresce at the left focal point of the ellipsoid .",
    "photons going to the left hit the ellipsoidal mirror ( @xmath4 mm , eccentricity @xmath5mm@xmath6 mm ) and are focused to the right focal point of the ellipsoid .",
    "photons going to the right hit the spherical mirror ( @xmath7 mm ) , are reflected back to their origin , and leave this point to the left towards the ellipsoidal mirror .",
    "finally , they are also focused to the right focal point of the ellipsoid",
    ". however , the atoms are not well localised but move through the probe laser beam that excites them in a fluorescing volume of about 1mm@xmath8 around the first focal point .",
    "in addition , holes in the mirrors are necessary to allow the probe beam and the atoms to enter the detector , and to finally extract the fluorescence photons .",
    "these geometrical restrictions limit the collection efficiency to about @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to these limitations , the surface of the hollow mirrors in our experiment is far from being perfect .",
    "the coated aluminium surface shows a reflectivity of only 80% , which in turn limits the total collection efficiency of the mirror setup to about 64% .",
    "furthermore , the design of our apparatus did not allow placing the cathode of a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) directly in the second focal point .",
    "a telescope consisting of an aspheric condenser lens ( @xmath10 mm , @xmath7 mm ) , a planoconvex lens ( @xmath11 mm , @xmath7 mm ) , and a biconvex lens ( @xmath12 mm , @xmath13 mm ) is used to image the photons onto the pmt , which is located outside the vacuum chamber . the total distance between the atoms and",
    "the pmt cathode is 50 cm . to reduce the background of ambient visible radiation to an acceptable level",
    ", we use a 10 nm wide band - pass filter .",
    "additionally , a spatial filter in the image plane of the telescope ( between the second and third lens ) serves to reduce light scattered from the edges of the hollow mirrors .",
    "all the elements of the imaging system lead to a further attenuation of the light .",
    "the telescope lenses and the window of the vacuum chamber have a transmission of 99% each , the band - pass filter transmits 70% , and the uncoated double - window of the pmt s cooling chamber 85% .",
    "we must also take into account that the rather large observation volume is not focused perfectly onto the pmt , since it is not completely covered by the acceptance angle of the condenser lens .",
    "we estimate that as much as 1/3 of the photons are lost by these geometric effects .",
    "hence , the collection efficiency of the whole setup ( mirrors , lenses , windows and filters ) amounts to about 25% .",
    "the remaining photons are finally imaged onto the photo - cathode of either a burle pmt with a quantum efficiency of 6% ( for the data shown in fig.[bursttime ] ) , or a hamamatsu r943 - 02 pmt with a quantum efficiency of 12% ( all other data ) .",
    "therefore the overall photo - detection efficiency is estimated to be about 1.5% or 3% , respectively .",
    "note that avalanche photo diodes would provide a much higher quantum efficiency , but at the cost of a significantly smaller sensitive area .",
    "hence we can not use them for the detection of moving atoms .",
    "[ detune ]    many atomic species provide a closed two - level system , i.e. a non - decaying stable energy level and an electronically excited level , which decays exclusively to the stable one . in a dilute gas",
    ", collisional losses can be neglected , and if the transition between the two levels is driven by a probe laser , the atom cycles between these levels , and a photon is emitted spontaneously whenever a decay from the excited level occurs . in our experiment , the probe laser with a wavelength of @xmath14 nm excites the @xmath15 transition of @xmath16rb ( see fig.[rb85 ] ) .",
    "thus , observation of fluorescence detects an atom in the state @xmath17 , whereas , e.g. , the second stable state @xmath18 does not fluoresce . in the limit of strong saturation and resonant excitation ,",
    "the spontaneous photon - scattering rate , @xmath19 , approaches @xmath20 per atom , where @xmath21 is the spontaneous decay rate of the excited level .",
    "however , the probe laser intensity , @xmath22 , is finite , the probe laser can be detuned from the atomic resonance by an amount @xmath23 , and any velocity of the atom with respect to the probe beam , @xmath24 , gives rise to a doppler shift .",
    "taking power broadening into account @xcite , the photon emission rate reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the saturation intensity , averaged over all magnetic sublevels of the considered transition , is @xmath27mw@xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 do not change during the interaction of the atoms with the probe beam , but we take into account that the atoms are accelerated because of light pressure . for each spontaneously emitted photon ( with an average momentum transfer of zero )",
    ", a probe photon is absorbed and the atom s velocity changes by the recoil velocity , @xmath30 , in the direction of the laser beam .",
    "this acceleration continues according to @xmath31 until the atom is doppler shifted out of resonance and stops fluorescing .",
    "figure [ bursttime](a ) shows the average fluorescence duration of @xmath16rb atoms as a function of the probe - beam height , @xmath32 .",
    "the interaction time of the atoms with the beam is given by @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath34s , the dependence is almost linear and the fluorescence duration equals @xmath35 . for longer interaction times",
    ", the fluorescence duration is limited to @xmath36s , due to the acceleration of the atoms and also possible losses to the @xmath18 level , as will be discussed later .",
    "hence , we must integrate eqs.([gamma],[dvdt ] ) in order to obtain the total number of fluorescence photons per atom , @xmath37 figure [ detune](b ) shows that the acceleration has a significant influence on the number of emitted photons , even for @xmath35 as small as @xmath38s .",
    "the maximum number of photons is counted when the probe beam is blue detuned from the atomic resonance by @xmath39mhz ( i.e. @xmath40 , with @xmath41rb@xmath42mhz ) . in this case , the interaction starts slightly off - resonance , but then the atoms are pushed into resonance and finally accelerated out of resonance again .",
    "provided this transient doppler shift is symmetric with respect to resonance , the number of emitted photons reaches its maximum .",
    "therefore the optimum detuning depends on the probe intensity and the chosen interaction time . for the parameters given in the caption of fig.[detune ] ,",
    "@xmath43 photons per atom are expected .",
    "it must be noted that the acceleration could be balanced by a second , counter - propagating probe beam that provides the same excitation probability as the first one .",
    "however , there was no need to investigate this situation , simply because the required time to detect a single atom , @xmath35 , is shorter than the time it takes to accelerate an atom out of resonance .    for longer interaction times",
    ", another loss mechanism becomes significant . the small probability to excite a @xmath16rb atom accidentally to @xmath44",
    "can not be neglected , simply because the probe laser ( resonant with the @xmath17 to @xmath45 transition ) , is only detuned by @xmath46mhz from the @xmath17 to @xmath44 transition . by off - resonant excitation to @xmath44 followed by spontaneous emission",
    ", the atoms can decay to @xmath18 , where they remain `` in the dark '' , i.e they are no longer excited by the probe laser due to the @xmath47ghz hyperfine splitting between the @xmath18 and the @xmath17 states .",
    "however , even for a @xmath48-fold saturated probe transition , the time needed to pump the atom into the other hyperfine state is about @xmath49s and , hence , significantly longer than @xmath35 .",
    "therefore these losses can be neglected and no second laser is needed to pump the atoms back to the @xmath50 level .    taking into account all these considerations ,",
    "we expect , on average , @xmath51 photons per atom for @xmath52 , @xmath53s and an optimal probe detuning @xmath54 . due to the @xmath55 photon detection efficiency of the collection system with the hamamatsu pmt , 20 photons per atom",
    "can actually be counted .",
    "to characterize the performance of the detector , we analyze the stream of events from the pmt .",
    "an example of a typical signal is shown in fig.[stream ] , which has been recorded with an average atom number in the observation volume far below one , i.e. the rate of atoms entering the detector , @xmath56 , was lower than the reciprocal interaction time , @xmath57 .",
    "several bursts of events , well separated from each other , can be distinguished .",
    "we attribute these bursts to single atoms that emit fluorescence photons at an average rate , @xmath58 , while they interact with the probe beam .",
    "this gives rise to an intermittend increased photon - detection rate , @xmath59 , which is significantly higher than the average noise - count rate , @xmath60 . from fig.[stream ] , it is also obvious that these noise counts , which are mainly caused by scattered probe light , can not be neglected .",
    "the second order autocorrelation , @xmath61 , of the measured photon stream is well suited for the further analysis .",
    "it should only depend on the rates @xmath62 , and @xmath35 , and it is defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the probability to observe a photon in the time interval @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "photons from different atoms are not correlated , and since photons from one - and - the - same atom are emitted only within the interaction time @xmath35 , @xmath66 must equal @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "if we assume that the event rate @xmath59 is constant while an atom interacts with the probe laser , a linear decrease of @xmath61 is expected in the range @xmath69 , and a simple calculation leads to the analytical expression @xmath70 note that this simple model neglects the anti - bunching of the sub - poissonian light emitted from single atoms @xcite .",
    "this is well justified since this effect is only visible on a sub-@xmath0s time scale .    in the experiment ,",
    "the noise rate , @xmath71 , and the total event rate , @xmath72 , are measured separately .",
    "using these two values as fixed parameters , a fit of @xmath61 from eq.([eq : ac ] ) to the autocorrelation of the experimental data , calculated according to eq.([eq : acdef ] ) , allows us to determine the average number of events per atom , @xmath73 , and the average duration of an atom s photon burst , @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ g2 ] shows the autocorrelation of a typical signal , together with the best fit to this data , yielding @xmath74 and @xmath75s . from these fit parameters , the measured noise rate , @xmath76khz , and the total number of 22232 photon events in @xmath77ms ( i.e. @xmath78khz ) , we know that a single atom causes an average number of @xmath79 events",
    "this is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation , @xmath80 .    for the time - resolved detection of single atoms ,",
    "it is essential to discriminate their signal from the background noise .",
    "unfortunately , this noise is mainly caused by light scattered from the probe beam .",
    "hence , it has the same wavelength as the fluorescence photons and can not be eliminated by interference filters .",
    "however , spatial filtering reduces the noise rate to @xmath81khz for a 2.7-fold saturated probe laser with an intensity of 10mw/@xmath29 , a height of 0.2 mm and a width of 0.7 mm . under these circumstances ,",
    "the event rate rises to @xmath82khz when an atom is in the observed volume , and the signal - to - background - noise ratio is @xmath83 . in the interesting time interval of @xmath53s ,",
    "an average number of noise events , @xmath84 , is expected , while the average number of events for a single atom is @xmath85 .",
    "figure[poisson ] shows poissonian probability distributions of the noise and the signal events for a @xmath86s long discrimination interval . for these distributions ,",
    "the optimum threshold to distinguish atoms from noise is @xmath87 .",
    "the possible errors can be estimated from poissonian statistics : on the one hand , the probability to attribute more than five noise events in an arbitrarily chosen @xmath86s long interval to be due to an atom is as low as 0.0027% , i.e. with a probability of 21% the noise gives rise to a single `` fake atom '' during the total measurement time of 524ms . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability to miss an atom because it does not emit enough photons is only 0.0034% , i.e. 0.03 atoms from the 945 atoms counted in 524ms are missing , which is negligible .    based on these considerations , we determine the arrival times of individual atoms from the registered photon stream with the help of the transient photon - count rate , @xmath88 , which is defined as the number of photons counted in the interval @xmath89 $ ] . for every time @xmath90 that coincides with the arrival time of an atom , all its photons fall into this interval , and @xmath88 reaches a peak value that coincides with the number of photons emitted from the atom .",
    "figure[poisson2](a ) shows the transient photon - count rate that belongs to the data from fig.[stream ] .",
    "we easily identify several peaks above threshold which indicate the arrival times of single atoms .",
    "for comparison , a trace without atoms is also shown , and obviously , the signal is always below the threshold for atom detection .",
    "figure[poisson2](b ) shows the distribution of the peak heights for two photon streams , one with atoms , and the other one without .",
    "some deviations from the ideal situation are evident .",
    "the numbers of detected photons per atom , @xmath91 , scatter over a much larger range than expected from poissonian statistics .",
    "we attribute this large variation to the different clebsch - gordan coefficients of the randomly populated magnetic sublevels , which give rise to a large variation of the saturation intensities of the involved transitions , i.e. @xmath92mw/@xmath29 for @xmath93-polarized light , and @xmath94mw/@xmath29 for @xmath95-polarized light .",
    "however , it is evident that most atoms can be well distinguished from noise , which itself is rarely identified as a `` fake atom '' .",
    "we expect that this simple , fast and state - selective way of detecting single atoms will be very useful in cavity - based quantum information processing .",
    "it allows one to probe the presence and the quantum state of individual atoms with high accuracy .",
    "a slight drawback is the momentum kick the atoms experience during detection , which might restrict application of our scheme to post selection .",
    "we have shown that laser - induced fluorescence from a saturated and ( nearly ) closed two - level atomic transition allows one to monitor single , freely moving atoms with a time resolution of @xmath86s . to collect the emitted photons , a mirror setup covering a very large solid angle",
    "is used , which focuses the photons onto a photomultiplier tube .",
    "a careful analysis of the measured data based on a second - order autocorrelation shows that , on average , 20.4 photons per atom are detected . in case of a poissonian distribution of noise and signal",
    "events , this signifies that a single atom is detected with 99.9966@xmath96 certainty , while noise counts exceed threshold with a negligible probability of 0.0027% . even the non - poissonian photon distribution , due to the manyfold of magnetic sublevels in our experiment ,",
    "barely affects the single - atom detection efficiency .",
    "in particular for quantum information science , this highly reliable , fast and state - selective detection of single atoms will be a very useful tool .",
