    "sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 consists of both two - leg ladders of copper ions and simple cuo@xmath3 chains @xcite as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "numerous experiments showed that the two - leg ladder has an excitation gap of @xmath1335 mev , @xcite which is expected theoretically .",
    "@xcite an important feature of this compound is that stoichiometric sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 contains hole carriers .",
    "it has been reported that most of the holes are localized in the chain and some exist in the ladder .",
    "@xcite when sr@xmath11 sites are substituted by ca@xmath11 ions , total number of the holes in the sample is unchanged but holes in the chain are transferred from the chain to the ladder @xcite and the system shows an insulator - to - metal transition @xcite .",
    "superconductivity was also observed in sr@xmath14ca@xmath15cu@xmath1o@xmath2 below @xmath16=10k under a high pressure of 3 gpa @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are only concerned with the magnetic properties in the chains .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the cuo@xmath3 chains in this compound .",
    "the copper ions are coupled by almost 90@xmath17 cu - o - cu bond along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "each chain is well isolated from each other along the @xmath4 and @xmath18 axes . as mentioned above ,",
    "there are localized holes in the chain .",
    "it is expected that the hole spins are localized at oxygen @xcite and couple with copper spins to form zhang - rice singlet @xcite .",
    "the nonmagnetic cu sites play an important role to form a dimerized state in the chain .",
    "first , the dimer is formed between next - nearest - neighbor cu@xmath11 spins along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the exchange interaction ( @xmath1310 mev ) is mediated via a nonmagnetic zr singlet .",
    "@xcite then the question is how the dimers are arranged and interact with each other .",
    "@xmath20 @xcite interpreted that each dimer is separated by one zr singlet along the @xmath5 axis ( model i ) as shown in fig .",
    "they also interpreted that the excitations at low-@xmath7 ( @xmath210.4 ) originate from a dimerized state in the chain and those at high-@xmath7 ( @xmath220.6 ) from a dimerized state due to the interladder coupling since two branches were observed for the gap excitations at low-@xmath7 but only one branch at high-@xmath7 .",
    "nmr studies revealed the microscopic properties of the dimerized state .",
    "@xcite it was reported that both magnetic cu@xmath11 and nonmagnetic zr singlet exist in the chain .",
    "it was also found that a nmr peak originating from zr singlet gradually splits into two peaks below @xmath13200 k. the results were discussed with two dimer models .",
    "one is model i mentioned above .",
    "this model was supported by cox @xmath19 @xmath20 by their x - ray measurements .",
    "@xcite in another model the dimers , which are formed between next - nearest - neighbor cu@xmath11 spins , are separated by two nonmagnetic zr singlets along the @xmath5 axis ( model ii ) as shown in fig .",
    "this model is consistent with the results of the electron diffraction study by hiroi @xmath19 @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite in which the cuo@xmath3 chains show a modulated structure with five times larger unit cell along the @xmath5 axis in stoichiometric sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "however , neither models can not completely explain the nmr results .",
    "recently , two unpublished papers @xcite on neutron scattering experiments came to our attention .",
    "@xmath20 @xcite explained the modulation of the excitations and intensities along the @xmath5 axis convincingly by a simple model of an alternating chain with weak interdimer coupling @xcite ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are intradimer and interdimer coupling , respectively ) , which is equivalent to model ii .",
    "it is noted that two parallel branches along the @xmath5 axis are not separated in the experiments because of insufficient resolution .",
    "@xcite briefly reported the measurement of two parallel branches in a wide range of @xmath7 ( 0.05@xmath270.925 ) along the @xmath5 axis , which suggested a weak coupling along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the specific coupling along the @xmath4 direction was recently reported by cox @xmath19",
    "@xmath20 @xcite in their synchrotron x - ray study of the charge ordering at low temperatures .",
    "since dimerized states sometimes occur in spin ( @xmath28 ) @xmath12 one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets such as the spin - peierls state , it is quite natural to assume that the dimerized state in the chain of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is also caused by a quantum effect in @xmath28=@xmath12 one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet . on the other hand ,",
    "almost isolated magnetic dimers were found in cacuge@xmath3o@xmath29 @xcite even though the geometrical arrangement of the magnetic moments seems three - dimensional .",
    "it was also claimed that magnetic moments which are geometrically closest does not necessarily couple most dominantly in vodpo@xmath30d@xmath3o @xcite and ( vo)@xmath3p@xmath3o@xmath31 @xcite because of the strong superexchange pathways through a covalently bonded po@xmath32 group .",
    "these results suggest that unexpected pathways could become important in order to completely understand the magnetic properties of magnetic materials .",
    "we have searched for a simple model of dimers with weak couplings along both @xmath5 and @xmath4 directions .",
    "@xcite somewhat surprisingly , a specific combination of the two couplings , as described by leuenberger @xmath19",
    "@xmath20 @xcite for cs@xmath33cr@xmath3br@xmath34 , produces simple and elegant neutron scattering cross sections which describe properly the measured dispersion and intensities . in this paper",
    ", we have studied @xmath6-@xmath7 dispersion relation perpendicular to the chain direction in considerable detail . by applying a random phase approximation ( rpa ) treatment",
    ", we found that the interdimer coupling along the @xmath4 axis ( @xmath10=0.75 mev ) is also important @xcite as well as the interdimer coupling along the @xmath5 axis ( @xmath9=0.75 mev ) .",
    "model cross section will be given after the experimental data are presented .",
    "the dimer arrangement along the @xmath5 axis is well described with model ii .",
    "the dimer configuration we found in this study indicates a quasi - two - dimensional hole ordering , resulting in an ordering of cu@xmath11 and zr singlet in the @xmath35 plane .",
    "ca substitution for sr makes the magnetic excitation peaks broader as in the case of y substitution @xcite probably because the hole ordering is very sensitive to the hole number and the long - range dimer formation becomes disturbed .",
    "the single crystals of sr@xmath36ca@xmath37cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath38=0 and 3 ) were grown using a traveling solvent floating zone ( tsfz ) method at 3 bars oxygen atmosphere .",
    "the dimension of the cylindrically shaped crystals is about 5 @xmath39 5 @xmath39 30 mm@xmath40 .",
    "the effective mosaic of the single crystal is less than 0.4@xmath17 with the spectrometer condition as described below .",
    "the sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal is the same one as used in ref . .",
    "it is expected that sr and ca are distributed homogeneously in sr@xmath41ca@xmath33cu@xmath1o@xmath2 since the lattice constants systematically change and the linewidth of the nuclear bragg peaks does not change when the ratio of sr and ca is changed .",
    "the lattice constants of sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and sr@xmath41ca@xmath33cu@xmath1o@xmath2 are @xmath4=11.472 @xmath42 and @xmath5=27.551 @xmath42 and @xmath4=11.430 @xmath42 and @xmath5=27.487 @xmath42 at 15 k , respectively .",
    "the lattice constants are consistent with those obtained with powder samples . @xcite",
    "the neutron scattering experiments were carried out on the issp - ponta spectrometer installed at the 5 g beam hole of the japan research reactor 3 m ( jrr-3 m ) at japan atomic energy research institute ( jaeri ) .",
    "the horizontal collimator sequences were 40@xmath43 - 40@xmath43-s-80@xmath43 - 80@xmath43 .",
    "the final neutron energy was fixed at @xmath44=14.7 mev .",
    "pyrolytic graphite ( 002 ) was used as monochromator and analyzer .",
    "contamination from higher - order beam was effectively eliminated using pyrolytic graphite filters after the sample .",
    "the single crystals were mounted in a closed cycle refregirator and were oriented in the @xmath45 scattering plane . as described in ref . , there are three different values for the lattice constant @xmath5 ( @xmath46=10 @xmath39 @xmath47=7 @xmath39 @xmath48 ) .",
    "since we will show the magnetic and structural properties in the chain , @xmath47 will be used to express miller indices .",
    "figure 2 shows the typical neutron inelastic spectra at ( @xmath49,0,@xmath50 ) in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 measured at 15 k. one or two distinct excitation peaks are observed in the @xmath51 scattering plane as in the @xmath52 scattering plane which was previously reported in ref @xcite .",
    "the solid lines at @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are fits to two gaussians and those at @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the fits to a single gaussian .",
    "the excitation peak positions are changed when @xmath49 or @xmath50 is changed , meaning a dispersion along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes .",
    "the width of the excitation peaks varies at different @xmath7 positions purely due to the resolution focussing effect . at @xmath56 , where resolution focussing is almost perfect ,",
    "the peak width has a resolution limited value of @xmath131 mev full width at half maximum .",
    "the observed excitation energies and energy - integrated intensities at ( 2,0,@xmath50 ) and ( 3,0,@xmath50 ) ( 0.1@xmath590.85 ) are plotted in figs . 3 and 4 , respectively .",

    "@xcite actually the dispersion relation is almost identical to the one observed in the @xmath52 zone . @xcite the most interesting feature is that the intensities and the ratio of the two peaks are changed with @xmath49 as well as @xmath50 .",
    "the intensities of the excitation peaks with lower excitation energy are more intense than those with higher excitation energy at @xmath60 ( @xmath620.25 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the intensities of the excitation peaks with higher excitation energy are more intense than those with lower excitation energy at @xmath60 ( @xmath630.6 ) .",
    "the intensities at @xmath60 are almost identical to those observed in the @xmath52 zone .",
    "@xcite the intensities at @xmath61 show completely opposite behavior from those at @xmath60 .",
    "it is noted that the intensities in ref . is the sum of intensities from the two excitations .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show the observed excitation energies and energy - integrated intensities at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( 2@xmath664 ) , respectively .",
    "the closed circles represent the data from the magnetic peaks with lower excitation energy and the open circles from the ones with higher excitation energy .",
    "the solid and broken lines are the results of model calculations , which will be presented in the next section .",
    "there also exists a dispersion along the @xmath4 axis with a periodicity of 2 r.l.u .",
    "the two dispersion curves along the @xmath4 axis do not run parallel as ones along the @xmath5 axis but cross at @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the intensities of the excitation peaks with lower excitation energy are larger than those with higher excitation energy in a range of 2@xmath692.5 and 3.5@xmath694 at @xmath64 . on the other hand , in a range of 2.5@xmath693.5",
    "the intensities of the excitation peaks with higher excitation energy are larger than those with lower excitation energy .",
    "the intensities at @xmath65 show completely opposite behavior from those at @xmath64 .",
    "thus , both the dispersion and the intensities depend on @xmath49 and @xmath50 , suggesting that there are nonnegligible magnetic correlations along the @xmath4 axis in addition to those along the @xmath5 axis .      in order to analyze the observed dispersion relation and energy - integrated intensities we used a model hamiltonian for the dimers formed between next - nearest - neighbor cu@xmath11 spins which are weakly coupled along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 axes as shown in fig . 7 .",
    "the hamiltonian involves three heisenberg hamiltonians with intradimer coupling @xmath8 , interdimer coupling in the same chain @xmath9 , and interdimer coupling between the adjacent chains @xmath10 :    @xmath70    here , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor spins in the same chain , respectively .",

    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , the rpa calculation predicts the temperature dependence of the dispersion relation and the energy - integrated intensities .",
    "the dispersion becomes flatter with increasing temperature as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "because the interdimer couplings become negligible due to large thermal fluctuations and the dimers behave like isolated dimers .",

    "the temperature dependences are fitted with the rpa calculation reasonably well although the observed intensity decreases more quickly than the calculated intensity does .",
    "this indicates that other factors in addition to thermal fluctuations disturb the dimers and the ordering of cu@xmath11 and zr singlet .",
    "a gradual destruction of the ordering with increasing temperature suggested by nmr @xcite and x - ray measurements @xcite might cause the behavior .",
    "now we discuss the relation between magnetic dimerization and structural distortion . as mentioned in sec .",

    "this lattice distortion is probably related with the nmr results @xcite since the superlattice intensity also decreases gradually with increasing temperature .",
    "it should be pointed out that the x - ray experiments properly detected the coupling along the @xmath4 axis but there is some disagreement along the @xmath5 axis . as mentioned above , the structural distortion has correlations with two and four times periodicities along the @xmath5 axis although magnetic dimers have correlations with five times periodicity . a discrepancy between magnetic and structural correlations",
    "was also reported in the spin - peierls state in cugeo@xmath33 .",
    "@xcite the magnetic excitations have a minimum energy at ( 0,1,@xmath12 ) but a superlattice reflection at ( @xmath12,1,@xmath12 ) .",
    "an important point is that the x - ray results are for the ground state and neutron results are for the excited state .",
    "we have shown that the dimer model shown in fig .",
    "7 explains the magnetic excitations reasonably well .",
    "the dimerized state is ascribed to the ordering of cu@xmath11 and zr singlet which originates from an ordering of the localized holes .",
    "hole ordering or charge ordering occurs in various 3@xmath91 transition metal oxides .",
    "a quasi - two - dimensional hole ordering of the doped holes was reported in la@xmath3nio@xmath92 @xcite and la@xmath93nd@xmath37sr@xmath94cuo@xmath32 @xcite . in the phase a static ordering of antiferromagnetic stripe",
    "is separated by charge ordered domain walls . in the latter compound",
    "the ordered phase can be described as a stripe ordering of cu@xmath11 and zr singlet .",
    "manganese oxides , for example la@xmath95ca@xmath37mno@xmath33 , also show a charge ordering of mn@xmath96 and mn@xmath97 .",
    "@xcite in this system spin , charge , and orbital @xcite degrees of freedom are closely related , which results in interesting phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "@xcite nav@xmath3o@xmath98 , which consists of two - leg ladders of vanadium ions , has been studied extensively since it shows a singlet ground state below 34 k. @xcite the phase transition was first considered to be a conventional spin - peierls transition . @xcite but the detailed inelastic neutron scattering experiment using single crystal sample revealed that the magnetic excitations in the dimerized phase could not be understood by a simple one - dimensional dimerized model .",
    "@xcite nmr experiment also indicated a charge ordering of v@xmath97 and v@xmath99 at the transition .",
    "@xcite stimulated by these experimental findings , new approaches to understand the origin of the phase transition have been made theoretically .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the transition is indeed closely related with a charge ordering of v@xmath97 and v@xmath99 ions .",
    "these various properties suggest that an intimate connection between hole / charge ordering and magnetic ordering is a common feature in the strongly correlated 3@xmath91 transition metal oxides .",
    "theoretical studies to explain the hole ordering and the dimerized state in sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 are highly desirable .",
    "we have also studied the substitution effect on the dimerized state .",

    "when y is substituted for sr , the number of the holes is decreased and the number of the cu@xmath11 spins is increased .",
    "it was reported that y substitution makes the magnetic excitation peaks broader . @xcite as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the ca substitution for sr also reduces the number of the holes in the chain gradually .",
    "@xcite therefore , the ca substitution is expected to affect the dimerized state in the chain .    figure 10 shows typical inelastic neutron spectra at ( 3,0,@xmath50 ) measured at 8 k in sr@xmath41ca@xmath33cu@xmath1o@xmath2 . the magnetic excitation peaks become broader with ca substitution , which is similar to the case of y substitution .",

    "iii - a , the averaged excitation energy , the band width of each excitation mode , and the energy difference between the acoustic and optic modes are related with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the coupling constants @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are almost unchanged with ca substitution although the dimerized state becomes unstable .",
    "this behavior would be explained as the following .",
    "the hole ordering sensitively depends on the hole number .",
    "accordingly , the long - range dimer formation becomes disturbed with ca or y substitution .    in sr@xmath36y@xmath37cu@xmath1o@xmath2 system , magnetic excitations",
    "are remarkably affected with y substitution .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath38=0.25 sample the excitation peaks become broader although the dispersion relation is almost unchanged .",
    "this result suggests that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are almost unchanged although the hole ordering is disturbed with a small amount of y. in the @xmath38=1 sample the excitation peaks become much broader , suggesting that the hole ordering becomes more unstable .",
    "an interesting behavior is that the averaged energy of the two excitations becomes reduced to @xmath139 mev , indicating that @xmath8 is decreased in sr@xmath103y@xmath104cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the changes of the bandwidth of each excited state , the difference in energy between two excited state , and the periodicity of the dispersion relation are difficult to be determined because the peaks are too broad to be resolved as two excitations .",
    "a puzzling feature is that @xmath8 is decreased in sr@xmath103y@xmath104cu@xmath1o@xmath2 although the lattice constant @xmath5 , which affects the exchange constant , is almost independent of y concentration .",
    "@xcite    when the holes are removed further , the hole ordering can not be observed anymore and a long - range magnetic ordering appears .",
    "@xcite the cuo@xmath3 chains in the hole removed sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 can be considered as ferromagnetic spin chains which are weakly coupled with antiferromagnetic interchain coupling along the @xmath4 and @xmath18 axes .    in conclusion ,",

    "<S> neutron scattering experiments have been performed on sr@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 which consists of both chains and ladders of copper ions . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath6-@xmath7 dispersion relation as well as the intensities can be reasonably described by a random phase approximation with intradimer coupling between next - nearest - neighbor copper spins @xmath8=11 mev , interdimer coupling along the @xmath5 axis @xmath9=0.75 mev , and interdimer coupling along the @xmath4 axis @xmath10=0.75 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the dimer configuration indicates a quasi - two - dimensional hole ordering , resulting in an ordering of magnetic cu@xmath11 with spin-@xmath12 and nonmagnetic cu , which forms the zhang - rice singlet . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the effect of ca substitution for sr on the dimer and the hole ordering . </S>"
