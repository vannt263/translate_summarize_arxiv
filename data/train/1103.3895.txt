    "direct imaging of exoplanets is now becoming a regular occurrence with the recent discoveries of 2m1207b  @xcite , fomalhaut b @xcite , beta pic b @xcite , 1rxs j1609 b @xcite , and the quadruple - planetary system hr8799 b , c , d , and e @xcite .",
    "hr8799 is , at present , a rare find among exoplanets with its four potentially massive planets ( @xmath9 5  10 m@xmath14 ) orbiting a @xmath15 myr a5 star @xcite , and is the first and , so far , only multi - planet system to be directly imaged .",
    "all four planets are accessible to photometric and spectroscopic followup observations across many wavelengths and , in this paper , near - ir spectra of hr8799b  are folded into a large set of photometric data for a broad - band analysis of the planet s photospheric properties .    since its discovery , a number of new photometric and astrometric measurements of the hr8799 system have been made .",
    "these new data have broadened the photometric wavelength coverage and extended the time coverage of orbital motion @xcite .",
    "the very precise astrometric data have already inspired a number of papers focused on the orbital dynamics and formation of the system ; however , the conclusions about the planetary masses and long term stability of the system from these works are mixed @xcite . as this paper focuses on photospheric properties , the dynamical nature of the system",
    "will not be discussed here .",
    "the goal of this paper is to characterize the properties of hr8799b , independent of what interior / evolution models predict and independent of what the age or dynamics of the system suggest . following a description of the new spectra and photometry added by this work ( section 2 ) , the available set of photometric and spectroscopic data",
    "are compared to similar data for brown dwarfs  the closest analogues to young giant planets ( section 3 ) .",
    "the atmospheric cloud and chemical properties of hr8799b  are inferred by comparing a new set of substellar atmosphere models to the available set of photometry and spectroscopy ( sections 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the results are compared to the predictions of interior / evolution models .",
    "also , given the potential for similarities , a comparison is made between hr8799b  and 2m1207b  ( section 6 ) .",
    "the conclusions from this work are summarized in the last section .",
    "observations of hr8799b  were made on july 22 , 23 , and 30 ( ut ) of 2009 and on july 11 and 13 ( ut ) of 2010 at the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "natural guide star adaptive optics and the oh - suppressing infra - red imaging spectrograph ( osiris ) instrument @xcite were used on the keck slowromancap2@  telescope .",

    "osiris is an integral field spectrograph that uses a grid of lenslets in the focal plane to dissect the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the light from each lenslet is dispersed by a grating , producing an array of spectra that are reassembled in the data reduction pipeline ( drp ) to a [ x , y , @xmath17 data cube .",

    "the final bcd data cubes were , at every spatial position , divided by the spectrum of an a0 standard star and multiplied by a black body ( @xmath19k ) .",
    "the spectrum of the a0 star was extracted from its data cube by fitting a 2d - gaussian at every monochromatic image - slice , rather than using the fixed - aperture extraction routine in the osiris drp .",
    "bd+14 4774 was discovered to be a binary ( 0.07  separation ) with a likely mid to late - type companion ; for this star a two - component gaussian psf was used to extract the a0 fluxes .",
    "the final bcd are cubes with wavelength and two spatial dimensions . at both @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ,",
    "the planet was clearly visible in all median - collapsed cubes ( median along wavelength ) .",
    "the nominal resolving power of osiris is @xmath20 with 1600 wavelength channels .",
    "however , to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , the bcd cubes were binned to 25 wavelength channels , down to @xmath21 .",
    "the wavelength positions of oh sky - lines and telluric star features were measured and no artificial wavelength shifts were discovered ; a potential concern given the temperature variations encountered during the observations .    while the planet is easily detected in all of the bcd cubes , contamination by scattered star light remains a concern .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the fov and orientation for the osiris observations and the extent of speckle contamination in the observed region . since the spatial scaling of the speckles , radially from the star , is proportional to @xmath22 , speckles can intersect the spatial location of the planet in a wavelength - dependent manner . to suppress the speckle pattern ,",
    "each bcd cube was processed with custom idl routines that first subtracts a ( spatially ) low - pass filtered version of the image slice in each wavelength channel and rebins the data cube ( by taking the median in the @xmath22 dimension ) to 25 wavelength channels ( r @xmath9 60 ) .",
    "each monochromatic image - slice of this rebinned cube is magnified about the stars position by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the median wavelength in either @xmath0 or @xmath1 band . in these shifted data cubes , individual speckles",
    "align and are fit with simple polynomial functions of @xmath22 .",
    "prior to this step , the planet is masked to avoid biasing the polynomial fit .",
    "the final polynomial fits to the speckle fluxes are subtracted from the shifted cube before finally reversing the magnification of the cube , placing the planet back in its original position",
    ". collapsed @xmath0-band data cubes , before and after speckle removal , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a similar improvement is seen in the before and after @xmath1-band data cubes ) . the speckle suppression scheme described here is similar to that used for the low - mass companion gq lupi b @xcite ; however , mcelwain et al . did not rescale the cubes for speckle fitting but instead fit the underlying speckle halo in each spectral bin of the data cube since each spatial location is more than critically sampled .",
    "the speckle suppression steps described above contain two important variables : the size of the masked region ( centered on the planet ) and the order of the polynomial used to fit the speckle fluxes .",
    "to determine the best pair of parameters , ten fake planets ( similar in brightness and fwhm as the real planet but with constant f@xmath25 ) were inserted into the bcd data cubes , evenly spaced but avoiding the real planet location as well as the edges of the fov .",
    "these cubes were processed using the twelve combinations of four mask radius values ( from 0.5 to 2 in 0.5 spaxel steps ) and three polynomial orders ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) . the parameters resulting in extracted fake planet spectra with the smallest mean deviation from a flat line and smallest rms(@xmath22 ) were mask radii equal to 1.5 and 2.0 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands respectively and a polynomial order equal to 1 for both bands .",
    "the mean residuals of all ten fake planet spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , straddling zero flux .",
    "the rms(@xmath22 ) for the fake planet spectra were comparable to , or smaller than , the final uncertainties adopted for the planet spectrum , providing confidence that the errors have not been significantly underestimated .",
    "furthermore , the data collected in 2009 compare very well to those from 2010 , indicating that the thermal instabilities and scaled darks had little impact on the final reduced spectra .",
    "the planet fluxes were obtained from the speckle - suppressed data ( ssd ) cube by convolving each monochromatic image - slice with a two - dimensional , gaussian , point - spread - function with fwhm = 2.2 ( @xmath0-band ) and 2.7 ( @xmath1-band ) spaxels .",
    "the final spectra were flux calibrated using @xmath0-band @xcite and a revised @xmath26 magnitudes ( discussed below ) .",
    "the final extracted spectra and corresponding error - bars ( taken as the rms of all the extracted spectra in each band - pass ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and listed in table [ tab2 ] .    as can be seen from the residuals of the fake planet fluxes ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the noise in the spectra is correlated between different wavelengths .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that the noise is primarily from the speckle pattern - the typical speckle has a monochromatic size of @xmath22/d , as does the extraction box for the planetary spectrum .",
    "a single speckle s position scales with wavelength proportional to @xmath22 . at @xmath1 band",
    ", the planet is located approximately 42 @xmath22/d from the star . for the speckle to move completely across the extraction box",
    "requires a change in wavelength of ( 43/42 - 1 ) @xmath12 2.1 @xmath27 m = 0.05 @xmath27 m .",
    "hence speckle noise patterns will be correlated across the spectrum over a range of 0.05 @xmath27 m @xcite . in principal this",
    "should be formally accounted for in the estimate of @xmath28 when fitting models to the data ( described below ) . however , since the spectral features being fit are also of width @xmath90.05 @xmath27 m or larger , the correlations in the noise have been ignored .",
    "the planet spectra , before and after speckle suppression , are also compared in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "near 1.7 @xmath27 m , the impact of a bright speckle can be seen as a fairly sharp peak spanning two wavelength channels . speckle noise and photon noise are roughly equal in these data sets at this binning , so speckle suppression improved the snr by approximately 50% .",
    "most importantly , the speckle noise that was removed was spectrally correlated across multiple channels and non - gaussian , e.g. the feature at 1.7 @xmath27 m in figure [ fig3 ] , and would have a much more significant effect on the final interpretation than the white photon noise .",

    "atmosphere models born from the study of brown dwarfs are commonly used to estimate the properties of giant planets and to estimate detection yields for direct imaging surveys , so it is natural to use such models as starting points for an analysis of hr8799b . arguably the most complex physical process to include in substellar atmosphere models is the presence of clouds .",

    "a large number of early brown dwarf models reproduced the basic trends of l and t dwarfs by approximating the cloudy and cloud - free conditions in a very simple manner ; by simply turning on ( cloudy ) or off ( cloud - free ) the opacity of dust in the atmosphere at its chemical equilibrium temperature - pressure location @xcite .",
    "this approach , taken to be the extreme limits of cloud influence , is not expected to reproduce every individual object well , especially those in the transition region from spectral types l to t. in fact , most objects should fall between these two limiting cases . in order to match the photometric and spectroscopic observations of hr8799b  a different approach",

    "figure [ fig6 ] also shows that very red objects with relatively low luminosities , like hr8799b , can be reproduced by allowing low @xmath3  models ( typically assumed to be in the regime of cloud - free photospheres ) to have clouds extending across their photosphere .",

    "the majority of atmosphere models for brown dwarfs and exoplanets assume local chemical equilibrium ; in other words , the mole fractions for each chemical compound is determined by the local temperature and pressure , and overall element abundances . for most atmospheric compounds ,",
    "this is an excellent approximation as the chemical reactions that establish the equilibrium mole fractions are rapid compared to the mixing time scales ( even in the convection zone ) .",

    "the same can be true for n@xmath54 and nh@xmath55 .",
    "@xcite showed that vertical mixing of co can be important in jupiter and , later , @xcite predicted that this would also be the case for brown dwarfs .",
    "the spectroscopic detections of co in several cool t - type brown dwarfs @xcite along with weaker than predicted fluxes from @xmath56 @xmath27 m ground and space - based photometry @xcite have established disequilibrium co mole fractions as a common occurrence in brown dwarfs .",

    "@xmath70 was found to be @xmath71 to 0.2@xmath72 , with @xmath72 equal to the pressure scale height .",
    "this range of @xmath69 is comparable to that found for jupiter @xcite .",
    "the major unknown when modeling vertical mixing is the eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath73 ) which , as is frequently done , is assumed here to be an adjustable parameter typically ranging from 100 to @xmath74 . with these chemical and mixing time scales , the mole fractions of co / ch@xmath2 and n@xmath54/nh@xmath55",
    "are  quenched \" at a specific depth in the atmosphere where @xmath75 .",
    "below this point in the atmosphere , where @xmath76 , chemical equilibrium prevails .",
    "this simple quenching model has been used in several recent studies of brown dwarfs and giant planets @xcite .",
    "the mixing and chemical time scales alone do not determine the final quenched mole fractions , the atmosphere temperatures and pressures still establish these values at the quenching depth .",
    "consequently , effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity play an important role .",
    "of particular importance is the relative location in the atmosphere of equal co / ch@xmath2 equilibrium mole fractions ( @xmath77 ) and where @xmath75 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "if @xmath79 , the co / ch@xmath2 ratio can be greater than 1 in cool substellar atmospheres where co would otherwise be predicted to be orders of magnitude less than ch@xmath2 .    as shown in figure [ fig7 ] , the magnitude of the disequilibrium effect is sensitive to surface gravity , as this quantity acts to shift the locations of @xmath78 and @xmath77 . as gravity decreases , the crossing point of the radiative and mixing time scales moves to deeper layers ( higher t ) , while the crossing of the equilibrium mole fractions of co and ch@xmath2 moves outward . for @xmath73 values",
    "typically used in brown dwarf models and at low surface gravities expected for young exoplanets , the co / ch@xmath2 ratio can become significantly greater than 1  indicating a role - reversal in the dominant carbon - bearing species at photospheric depths .",
    "such a role reversal has not been explored thoroughly in brown dwarfs as their surface gravities and effective temperatures almost always place the time scale crossing point at a pressure lower than that of the equilibrium co / ch@xmath2 crossing point , resulting in a co / ch@xmath2 ratio always less than 1 ( though still greater than equilibrium chemistry predictions ) .",
    "@xcite also noted a gravity dependence for non - equilibrium chemistry , but did not explore gravities below @xmath51= 4.5 nor encountered a co / ch@xmath2 reversal .",
    "since a low surface gravity and effective temperature are possible outcomes for hr8799b , a lack of ( or very weak ) ch@xmath2 could be caused by disequilibrium chemistry .",
    "hr8799b  is located a mere 68 au from its host star and receives far too little stellar flux for irradiation to have a significant influence on its atmospheric thermal structure ( at near - ir photospheric depths ) .",
    "however , hr8799a is much more luminous ( @xmath80 l@xmath81 ) and hotter ( @xmath3= 7500k ) than the sun and the uv flux from hr8799a may be sufficient to produce photochemical reactions in the atmosphere of hr8799b  and certainly for the inner three planets . based on a synthetic spectrum from a stellar model atmosphere calculation tailored for hr8799a ( also using phoenix , with atoms and ions treated in non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ) , hr8799b  is estimated to receive @xmath9 8 times the flux that jupiter receives from the sun for @xmath82 , and about 10 times as much flux as neptune for @xmath83 . given the larger atmospheric temperatures and possibly extreme non - equilibrium co / ch@xmath2 mole fractions compared to the giant planets in the solar system , the photochemical reactions in hr8799b  will also be quite different from those found in the solar system .",
    "consequently , photochemistry could impact the model comparisons discussed below .",
    "unfortunately , photochemical reactions are not included in the version of phoenix  used here .",
    "future observations and modeling will be needed to address this possibility .",
    "the complete set of hr8799b  broad - band photometry covers a broader wavelength range than the osiris spectroscopic observations and , therefore , are likely to provide the greatest leverage when estimating effective temperature and , potentially when estimating the cloud properties .",
    "@xcite did not perform a model fit to the discovery photometry but , rather , focused on the parameters inferred from theoretical cooling tracks and the observed luminosity and age range .",
    "with new and improved photometry available , new model fits to these data are now warranted ( see @xcite and @xcite for independent model comparisons to similar photometric data and different model atmospheres ) . additionally , the near - ir spectra are likely to contain the greatest information on surface gravity , chemical composition ( via broad - band absorption features ) , and also on the cloud properties .",
    "the goal in this section is to identify a single model atmosphere that best fits all three observational data sets and to understand what physical mechanisms play dominant roles in shaping the overall spectral energy distribution .",

    "however , the increasing number of free parameters in substellar atmosphere models is a clear indication that they are even more complex than previously imagined .",
    "thus , the possibility still remains that hidden among the free parameters is an atmosphere model with @xmath3  and @xmath51that matches the evolution model predictions .",
    "the need for an intermediate cloud model ( constrained vertically ) , to match the observed broad - band photometry of all three hr8799 planets , was first discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a synthetic spectrum from a solar abundance model atmosphere with an intermediately thick cloud and @xmath3  @xmath114 @xmath51  consistent with evolution model predictions ( 820k @xmath114 4.0 ) matched the available observed photometry at 3-@xmath29 . while only ch4@xmath115 , @xmath39 , @xmath0 , @xmath26 , and l@xmath116 photometry where available in 2008 , this earlier ( chemical equilibrium ) model remains consistent",
    "( @xmath9 3-@xmath29 ) with all of the revised / new broad - band photometry ( see fig . [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "however , the true level of agreement between this model and reality is revealed by the osiris data ( fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) where much weaker ch@xmath2 absorption is observed than predicted by this chemical equilibrium model .",
    "this discrepancy highlights the difficulties in obtaining a reliable description of young giant planets from photometry alone , which can hide significant clues about their atmospheric properties .    to explore differences between",
    "the atmosphere and evolution derived bulk parameter more closely , a separate grid of atmosphere models was computed , with @xmath3  and @xmath51  uniformly sampling the evolution track predictions that are consistent with the observed luminosity of hr8799b  ( down the center of the grey band in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) .",
    "the clouds and non - equilibrium chemistry were modeled in the same manner as in the solar abundance grid described above , yet only @xmath49  = 5 and 10 @xmath27 m were used .",
    "the metallicity , however , was extended beyond solar abundances to include two metal rich cases ( [ fe / h ] = 0.5 and 1.0 ) and an abundance pattern matching the observed peculiar ( @xmath22-boo - type ) subsolar abundances of hr8799 @xcite .",
    "the best fitting model from this  evolution - consistent \" grid has @xmath3  = 896k , @xmath51  = 4.3 , [ fe / h ] = 1.0 , @xmath117 ( see fig . [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "the agreement between this metal - rich model and the osiris @xmath0 and @xmath1-band spectra is similar to that of the previous hotter , solar abundance , best fit .",
    "the broad - band photometric comparison is also good ( mostly to 1-@xmath29 ) , but slightly worse compared to the solar abundance model at @xmath39 and @xmath1 bands ( see figure [ fig14 ] ) but still consistent at 2-@xmath29 .",
    "the lowering of @xmath3  by increasing metallicity is to be expected .",
    "looking at the @xmath118 versus @xmath119 cmd in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , in order for cooler atmospheres to match hr8799b  they need to be redder in @xmath119 and this can be accomplished by increasing metallicity and/or by decreasing the modal grain size @xcite .",
    "the mean @xmath28 for this metal - rich comparison is @xmath120 and only marginally better than the solar abundance model at the same temperature and gravity .",
    "however , given that even in this smaller grid the parameter space is still sparsely sampled , there is plenty of room for improvement .      in near - ir cmds ,",
    "the object most similar to hr8799b  is 2m1207b , a planet - mass companion to a young ( @xmath121 myr ) brown dwarf @xcite .",
    "in addition to their very red colors , these two objects also share the same puzzling fact that their seds appear hotter than evolution models predict , for their ages and luminosities .",
    "available photometry and spectroscopy of 2m1207b  show all the signs of an object with effective temperature @xmath122k @xcite .",
    "when combined with current luminosity estimates ( @xmath123 ) , the radius implied by this high effective temperature is @xmath110 @xmath7 , comparable to the small size inferred above for hr8799b .",
    "consequently , _ both _ 2m1207b  and hr8799b  are underluminous compared to hot - start evolution models and overluminous for cold start models , for their respective ages .",
    "@xcite concluded that the high effective temperature was likely correct and , thus , 2m1207b  is underluminous by @xmath124 magnitudes .",
    "given that the distance to the source ( 52.4 @xmath32 1.1 pc ) is known @xcite , @xcite proposed that an edge - on disk surrounds 2m1207b  providing the necessary extinction .",
    "alternatively , @xcite proposed that 2m1207b  is not a normal gas giant but rather the product of a recent protoplanetary collision and the observed flux is the afterglow from the hot , physically small , remnant .",
    "given that hr8799bsuffers from a similar quandary , it is unlikely that such rare events should be necessary to explain the first and only two objects found in the very red and faint regions of near - ir cmds .",
    "given the puzzling similarities between 2m1207b  and hr8799b  mentioned above , it is useful to compare their seds .",
    "moderate resolution ( @xmath125 ) @xmath0 and @xmath1-band spectra of 2m1207b  @xcite are compared to the hr8799b  spectra in figure [ fig15 ] .",
    "the spectrum of 2m1207b  has shallower h@xmath54o bands with a distinct co band - head at 2.3 @xmath27 m and no prominent ch@xmath2 absorption  a spectrum very much like typical l dwarfs .",
    "the only feature the two sets of spectra have in common is a triangular shaped spectrum in the @xmath0 band , consistent with both objects having low surface gravity ( indicative of low mass and/or youth ) . assuming both objects are not the result of recent protoplanetary collisions , 2m1207b  and hr8799b  may well represent important evolutionary states of substellar atmospheres .",
    "independent of the edge - on disk hypothesis , if the ages of the two systems are correct , then the planets masses are probably the same to within a factor of 2 .",
    "if the masses are similar , then these objects provide evidence for rapid spectral changes from 10 to @xmath109 myr for young planet - mass objects .",
    "the analysis of hr8799b  described above provides a third possible explanation for the properties of 2m1207b   namely that certain combinations of cloud coverage and non - equilibrium chemistry ( and perhaps metallicity ) are capable of producing a very low temperature object with an l - type near - ir spectrum .",
    "the two hypotheses proposed by mohanty et al . and mamajek et al .",
    "hinge on the assumption that the effective temperature of 2m1207b  is @xmath9 1600k .",
    "however , looking back at figure [ fig6 ] , 2m1207b  is intersected by an intermediate cloudy model with @xmath3  = 1100k , close to evolution model predictions and consistent with a typical radius .",
    "also , given the apparently extreme reduction of ch@xmath2 in the atmosphere of hr8799b , it is conceivable that the co / ch@xmath2 mole fractions are quenched at even higher pressures in the younger ( and likely lower gravity ) atmosphere of 2m1207b , resulting in a low temperature atmosphere that is rich in co ( perhaps enough to produce a distinct co bandhead at 2.3 @xmath27 m , as seen in the spectrum from patience et al . ) and without significant amounts of ch@xmath2 .",
    "a search for such a cold , cloudy , model atmosphere with extreme non - equilibrium chemistry for 2m1207b  is underway and will be presented in a separate paper ( barman et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "despite their spectral differences , the most straightforward explanation for the positions of 2m1207b  and hr8799b  in near - ir cmds is one of atmospheric origins . instead of an edge - on disk or recent protoplanetary collision ,",
    "a full exploration of the cloud properties , non - equilibrium chemistry , and metallicity is likely required to reproduce their observed seds with a model atmosphere having @xmath3  and @xmath51  consistent with evolution predictions .",
    "however , as more and more important physical processes are identified in substellar atmospheres , the number of free ( and essentially independent ) parameters increases and the ability to exhaustively explore all possible parameter combinations diminishes  more work ( along the lines of freytag et al . 2010 ) is clearly required to reduce the current set of parameters and produce more unified model atmospheres .",
    "the hr8799 planetary system provides a rare opportunity to study multiple , coeval , giant planets at very young ages .",
    "the data and model comparisons described above are only first steps toward understanding just one of these planets and many challenging problems remain . while the data presented here offer the broadest spectral coverage for an hr8799 planet obtained so far , the low resolution and modest signal - to - noise set strong limits on what can be understood about hr8799b .",
    "in addition to the limits imposed by the data , the complexity and excess of free parameters in model atmospheres for giant planets and brown dwarfs also set strong limits on what can be confidently inferred from observations . with these limitations in mind ,",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from the observations of hr8799b .",
    "the sed of hr8799b  is shaped by water absorption bands that are deeper than typically seen in late l and early t field dwarfs , but clearly consistent with a hydrogen - rich planetary atmosphere .",
    "only weak methane absorption is detected in the @xmath1 band along with very weak co absorption , indicating strong non - equilibrium chemistry and vertical mixing .",
    "additional evidence for very weak methane absorption is seen in the @xmath0 band spectrum ( and narrow - band photometry ) .",
    "the near - ir spectra and broad - band photometry are smoothed and reddened by photospheric clouds not typical for brown dwarfs with @xmath3@xmath126 1100k .",
    "the triangular shape of the @xmath0-band spectrum clearly indicates low surface gravity ( @xmath127 ) , consistent with an age significantly younger than that proposed by @xcite .",
    "the best match from a solar abundance grid of model atmospheres ( having @xmath3= 1100k and @xmath51= 3.5 ) found above implies a radius that is too small to be consistent with both the observed luminosity and the current understanding of the interiors and evolution of h+he - rich planets , regardless of mass , age , or interior core - size . furthermore , a variety of model atmospheres can be constructed that fit the observed broad - band photometry very well ( at least from the model grids used here ) , yet do not match the observed spectra  indicating that parameters inferred from broad - band photometric fits alone should be treated with caution .    while certainly not perfect , the model comparisons presented here are better representations of the observations than those presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , bowler et al . found fits to their narrow - band spectrum that require @xmath3@xmath128k , which leads to unphysically small radii of @xmath129@xmath7 .",
    "these previous studies also had difficulty simultaneously fitting the photometry ; for example , currie et al . found it difficult to match most of the photometry , especially at @xmath130 m ( even with their thick or patchy cloud models ) and bowler et al . had difficulty matching the near - ir colors for reasonable @xmath3 .",
    "these difficulties may stem from the sparse sampling of model parameters in the grids used in these two studies ( e.g. those parameters regulating non - eq .",
    "chemistry and clouds ) , though considerable degeneracies are present when fitting only broad - band photometry .",
    "furthermore , the best fitting models for hr8799b  found by currie et al . typically have deeper methane absorption than seen in the broad @xmath1-band spectrum described above or the narrow - band spectrum of bowler et al .",
    "interestingly , currie et al . emphasize cloud thickness / coverage over non - equilibrium chemistry , in particular as it pertains to the near - ir sed . the analysis presented here ,",
    "however , requires deep quenching of co / ch@xmath2 to match the near - ir spectra ( and near - ir narrow - band photometry ) , placing equal importance on both atmospheric effects when reproducing the observations .    finding a solar abundance atmosphere that matches the complete set of data and interior / cooling - track predictions seems unlikely ( though still not inconceivable ) .",
    "a more likely scenario is that the atmosphere of hr8799b  has an elemental composition different from the sun .",
    "a model atmosphere that matches the observations reasonably well ( as well or better than any previous study ) , including the predictions of evolution models , can be found if the atmosphere is enhanced by a factor 10 in metals compared to the sun .",
    "such a model has @xmath3  = 896k and @xmath51  = 4.3 , consistent with a young giant planet with mass less than 10 @xmath10 . at @xmath9",
    "30 myrs , as recently proposed by @xcite , the mass of hr8799b  would be 4 to 5 @xmath10",
    ".    if hr8799b  is indeed metal rich and near the very low end of the original mass range inferred by @xcite , then core - accretion may be the preferred formation mechanism for the hr8799 planetary system .",
    "metal enrichment , relative to the host star , is often considered a hallmark of the core - accretion scenario and recent work indicates that if the hr8799 planets formed by gravitation instabilities , they should show little metal enhancement @xcite .",
    "atmosphere models with either solar abundances or the metal poor @xmath22-boo - like abundances of the star result in @xmath3  that are too high and corresponding radii that are too small .",
    "the analysis of @xcite also indicates that enhanced metals ( and low gravity ) are likely to produce the best model fits .",
    "while these conclusions rest heavily on models not tested by a large population of young giant planets ( such a population should emerge in the coming years ) , the conclusions are self - supporting . low surface gravity , clearly preferred by the model fitting ( regardless of metallicity ) and indicated by the shape of the @xmath0-band spectrum , may well allow for more efficient vertical mixing .",
    "as surface gravity decreases , the radiative - convection boundary moves closer to the photosphere , the maximum convective velocity increases , and @xmath84  also increases , at least in the convection zone @xcite .",
    "enhanced vertical mixing leads to enhanced non - equilibrium chemistry , as suggested by the absence of ch@xmath2 absorption in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "however , the connection between gravity and mixing is merely suggestive as the primary physical mechanism for mixing into the radiative zone unknown .",
    "low surface gravity may also establish atmospheric conditions ( not found in the higher gravity field t dwarfs ) that support thick clouds at photospheric depths , allowing the intersection of the t - p curve and the condensation curve to be near the photosphere even at low @xmath3 .",
    "a connection between clouds and surface gravity is already starting to emerge for brown dwarfs .",
    "evidence for a gravity dependence for the l - to - t transition has already been reported @xcite and , recently , @xcite found that low - gravity brown dwarfs in their sample remain cloudy at lower effective temperatures , with the l - to - t transition temperature decreasing from 1300k to 1100k as @xmath51  decreases from 5.0 to 4.5 .",
    "@xcite also found that hd20303b , a low gravity transition brown dwarf , is @xmath9 250k cooler than field objects with similar spectral types .",
    "if hr8799b  has a @xmath51  @xmath131 , then it is possible that this emerging trend extends to this object as well , and would suggest that very low gravity objects ( like young giant planets ) are cloudy down to temperatures well below 1000k .",
    "the structure of the clouds needed to reproduce the colors and spectra of the hr8799 planets and 2m1207b are similar to those needed for late l - dwarfs .",
    "this suggests that such objects , from an atmospheric point of view , are extensions of the l - type field dwarfs rather than members of a new class altogether .",
    "this conclusion is distinct from that of currie et al . who claim the clouds must be significantly thicker than those required to match l dwarfs .",
    "finally , enhanced metals would also lead to enhanced grain formation and conditions ripe for atmospheric cloud formation .",
    "the combination of these atmospheric conditions lead to bulk properties , inferred from the sed analysis alone , that include a radius consistent with the observed luminosity and current understanding of giant planet interiors , as well as a mass that fits comfortably within the limits required for long - term dynamical stability .",
