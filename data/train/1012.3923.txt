    "blazars are a class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) comprised of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl  lac objects . their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by non - thermal continuum spectra with a broad low - frequency component in the radio  uv or x - ray frequency range and a high - frequency component from x - rays to @xmath1-rays , and they often exhibit substantial variability across the electromagnetic spectrum . in the vhe @xmath1-ray regime ,",
    "the time scale of this variability has been observed to be as short as just a few minutes @xcite .",
    "while previous generations of ground - based atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( act ) facilities detected almost exclusively high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ( hbls ) as extragalactic sources of vhe @xmath1-rays ( with the notable exception of the radio galaxy m87 ) , in recent years , a number of non - hbl blazars and even non - blazar radio - loud agn have been detected by the current generation of acts .",
    "this suggests that most blazars might be intrinsically emitters of vhe @xmath1-rays . according to agn unification schemes @xcite , radio galaxies are the mis - aligned parent population of blazars with the less powerful fr  i radio galaxies corresponding to bl  lac objects and fr  ii radio galaxies being the parent population of radio - loud quasars .",
    "blazars are those objects which are viewed at a small angle with respect to the jet axis . if this unification scheme holds , then , by inference , also radio galaxies may be expected to be intrinsically emitters of vhe @xmath1-rays within a narrow cone around the jet axis .    while there is little evidence for dense radiation environments in the nuclear regions of bl  lac objects  in particular , hbls ",
    ", strong line emission in flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) as well as the occasional detection of emission lines in the spectra of some bl  lac objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this is supported by spectral modeling of the seds of blazars using leptonic models which prefer scenarios based on external radiation fields as sources for compton scattering to produce the high - energy radiation in fsrqs , lbls and also some ibls ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath3 absorption cut - off at an energy @xmath40  tev is very smooth in this simulation because of the broad thermal blackbody spectrum of the external radiation filed . in contrast , the @xmath41-function approximation for the external radiation field adopted in @xcite resulted in an artificially sharp cutoff in that work .    at off - axis viewing angles , the observed spectrum is exclusively the result of the cascade . in the limit of low photon energies ( far below the @xmath3 absorption threshold ) and neglecting particle escape from the cascade zone",
    ", one expects a low - frequency shape close to @xmath42 due to efficient radiative cooling of secondary particles injected at high energies @xcite .",
    "however , with the typical parameters used for this parameter study , the assumption of negligible particle escape is not always justified . in order to estimate the possible suppression of the low - frequency cascade emission due to particle escape , we calculate the critical electron energy for which the compton cooling time scale @xmath43 equals the escape time scale , @xmath44 . using a characteristic thermal photon energy of @xmath45 , the resulting compton scattered photon energy , @xmath46",

    "escape affects even ultrarelativistic electrons , resulting in a substantial hardening of the low - energy photon spectrum .",
    "figure [ tfig ] illustrates the effect of a varying temperature of the external blackbody radiation field .",

    "the isotropization turnover is almost independent of @xmath20 . for temperatures @xmath68  k the cascade flux decreases with increasing @xmath20 because @xmath10 remains fixed , leading to a decreasing photon number density and absorption opacity @xmath24 with increasing @xmath20 ( and , hence , increasing @xmath69 ) .",
