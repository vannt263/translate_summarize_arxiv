    "<S> the relation between thermodynamic phase transitions in classical systems and topology changes in their state space is discussed for systems in which equivalence of statistical ensembles does not hold . as an example , the spherical model with mean field - type interactions is considered . </S>",

    "<S> phase transitions , like the boiling and evaporating of water at a certain temperature and pressure , are common phenomena both in everyday life and in almost any branch of physics . loosely speaking , a phase transition brings about a sudden change of the macroscopic properties of a system while smoothly varying a parameter ( the temperature or the pressure in the above example ) . for the description of equilibrium phase transitions within the framework of statistical mechanics , several so - called statistical ensembles or gibbs ensembles , like the microcanonical or the canonical one , are at disposal , each corresponding to a different physical situation . for a large class of systems with sufficiently short ranged interactions , these different approaches lead to identical numerical values for the typical system observables of interest , after taking the thermodynamic limit of the number of particles in the system going to infinity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation one speaks of equivalence of ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> then , instead of selecting the statistical ensemble according to the physical situation of interest , one can revert to the ensemble most convenient for the computation intended . for systems with long range interactions , however , </S>",
    "<S> equivalence of ensembles does not hold in general . </S>",
    "<S> systems showing such an inequivalence of ensembles in the thermodynamic limit ( among those gravitational systems and bose - einstein condensates ) have attracted much research interest in the last years ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review ) . </S>",
    "<S> dramatic differences between the ensembles can be observed for example in the specific heat , which is a strictly positive quantity in the canonical ensemble , whereas negative values , and even negative divergences , can occur in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an entirely different approach to phase transitions , not making use of any of the gibbs ensembles , has been proposed recently . </S>",
    "<S> this _ </S>",
    "<S> topological approach _ connects the occurrence of a phase transition to certain properties of the potential energy @xmath0 , resorting to _ topological _ concepts . from a conceptual point of view </S>",
    "<S> , this approach has a remarkable property : the microscopic hamiltonian dynamics can be linked via the lyapunov exponents to the topological quantities considered @xcite . with the topological approach , in turn , linking a change of the topology to the occurrence of a phase transition , a concept is established which provides a connection between a phase transition in a system and its underlying microscopic dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the topological approach is based on the hypothesis @xcite that phase transitions are related to topology changes of submanifolds @xmath1 of the state space of the system , where the @xmath1 consist of all points @xmath2 of the state space for which @xmath3 , i.e. , their potential energy per degree of freedom equals a certain level @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( or , in a related version , the topology of submanifolds @xmath5 consisting of all points @xmath2 with @xmath6 is considered . ) </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis has been corroborated by numerical and by exact analytical results for a model showing a first - order phase transition @xcite as well as for systems with second - order phase transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a major achievement in the field is the recent proof of a theorem , stating , loosely speaking , that , for systems described by smooth , finite - range , and confining potentials , a topology change of the submanifolds @xmath1 is a _ necessary _ criterion for a phase transition to take place @xcite .    albeit necessary , such a topology change is clearly not _ sufficient _ to entail a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this follows for example from the analytical computation of topological invariants in the xy model @xcite , where the number of topology changes occurring is shown to be of order @xmath7 , but only a single phase transition takes place . </S>",
    "<S> so topology changes appear to be rather common , and only particular ones are related to phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> there are strong indications that a criterion based exclusively on topological quantities can not exist in general @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> having mentioned the recent efforts to more firmly establish sufficient and necessary relations between topology changes and phase transitions , and bearing in mind the phenomenon of ensemble inequivalence , we notice an additional complication : in the case of inequivalence , such a relation can not simply connect topology changes to phase transitions , but , because of the existing differences , only to phase transitions _ in a certain statistical ensemble_. it is the objective of the present letter to clarify the connection between the topological approach and the description of phase transitions within the various statistical ensembles .    to this purpose , the so - called spherical model with mean field - type interactions </S>",

    "<S> but even more can be done : the spherical mean - field model is one of the rare models with interacting degrees of freedom , for which the microcanonical entropy can be computed explicitely for systems with an arbitrary finite number @xmath7 of degrees of freedom @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> canonical ensemble_. g.  s.  joyce @xcite has given an exact canonical solution for the spherical model with quite general long range interactions in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",

    "<S> ensemble inequivalence_. for non - zero external field , no phase transition occurs in the mean field spherical model , neither in the microcanonical , nor in the canonical ensemble . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath26 , however , remarkable differences between the two ensembles are observed : the _ absence _ of a temperature ( or energy ) driven phase transition in the microcanonical ensemble is in contrast to the _ presence _ of such a transition in the canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the particular scenario occurring is termed _ partial equivalence of ensembles _ in @xcite , and a few other models of statistical mechanics are known to exhibit this phenomenon @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ topological approach_. as a starting point for the topological approach , the submanifolds @xmath1 of the state space , consisting of all points where the potential energy per particle equals @xmath4 , are considered . in the case of the spherical model , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath36 consists of a potential energy term only , and we define @xmath37 where the state space @xmath38 of the spherical model is an ( @xmath71)-sphere @xmath39 with radius @xmath17 . ribeiro teixeira and stariolo have analyzed the topological structure of the state space submanifolds of the mean field spherical model in @xcite . completing their findings and translating them into our notation , the topology of the submanifolds @xmath1 can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 indicates topological equivalence , the @xmath42-sign denotes a topological ( unconnected ) sum , and @xmath43 is the empty set . </S>",

    "<S> , we can expect a necessary and sufficient relation to exist , if at all , only between the topological approach and _ one _ of the statistical ensembles .    comparing the topology of @xmath1 in ( [ sigma_topo ] ) with </S>",
    "<S> the _ canonical _ thermodynamics of the mean field spherical model with zero external field @xmath26 , one would associate the phase transition observed at inverse temperature @xmath32 and internal energy @xmath49 with the topology change from @xmath50 to @xmath43 at @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same type of topology change is present for all @xmath52 at @xmath53 , whereas canonical thermodynamics asserts the absence of a phase transition for all @xmath29 . from this observation , and disregarding the presence of ensemble inequivalence in the mean field spherical model , ribeiro teixeira and stariolo @xcite concluded that the information contained in the topology of @xmath1 ( or , in a related description , of @xmath5 ) might not be sufficient as to distinguish between the presence of a phase transition or its absence .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a much simpler explanation arises from a comparison of the topology of @xmath1 with the _ microcanonical _ thermodynamics of the model . </S>",
    "<S> microcanonically , the zero field case is not special , as a phase transition occurs neither with nor without an external field . </S>",
    "<S> this is in accordance with the topological results where the topology change is the same for all @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the mean - field spherical model is not the only example for which the observed topology changes find a meaningful interpretation only when compared to microcanonical quantities . for the mean - field xy model considered in @xcite , the observed discontinuity in the modulus of the euler characteristic </S>",
    "<S> is interpreted as being related to the phase transition in the canonical ensemble at @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> however , similarly to the mean - field spherical model , the same topology change is present for @xmath29 , although a phase transition does not occur in this case . </S>",
    "<S> again , a comparison with microcanonical quantities can provide a meaningful interpretation of the findings .    after having discussed the relation between the topological approach and the two ensembles ( the microcanonical and the canonical one , respectively ) on the basis of examples , some general remarks are in order . </S>",
    "<S> the microcanonical ensemble is the most fundamental of the gibbs statistical ensembles : it is based only on the assumption of equal _ a priori _ probabilities of the states of the system , and the other statistical ensembles can be derived from it . </S>",
    "<S> the topological approach , in turn , is a fundamental description in the sense that it is closely connected to the microscopic dynamics which is the basic level of description underlying the thermodynamics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively it seems reasonable to expect a closer relationship between these two particularly fundamental approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> this relation can be substantiated by noting that the microcanonical ensemble and the topological approach , different as they are , have the same quantity as a starting point : the microcanonical partition function ( = density of states ) of a system , which is at the basis of the microcanonical ensemble , can be defined as the _ volume _ of the level sets ( [ sigma_def ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> considering , instead of the volume , the _ topology _ of the very same level sets , we arrive at the fundamental quantity underlying the topological approach , and , in the light of this observation , the close connection between these two concept appears plausible .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary_. we have presented exact results for microcanonical , canonical , and topological quantities of the mean field spherical model . comparing the microcanonical and the canonical quantities , we observe that , for this model , equivalence of the statistical ensembles does not hold : microcanonically , no phase transition occurs , whereas in the canonical ensemble a phase transition takes place for zero external field . in order to investigate the connection between the thermodynamics of the system and the topological approach to phase transitions , we have compared topological quantities to microcanonical and canonical ones . as a consequence of the observed ensemble inequivalence </S>",
    "<S> , a one - to - one connection can , at best , be expected between the topological approach and _ one _ of the statistical ensembles . from the results for the mean field </S>",
    "<S> spherical model , we find that it is the comparison of topological quantities with _ </S>",
    "<S> microcanonical _ results which allows a meaningful and convincing interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the close conceptual connection between the topological approach and the microcanonical ensemble suggests that , whenever ensemble inequivalence occurs , microcanonical thermodynamics is the adequate reference frame to confront the topological approach with . </S>"
