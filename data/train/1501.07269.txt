    "yi et al . ( 2014 , hereafter yi14 ) discovered sdss j013127.34032100.1 ( hereafter sdss 01310321 ) as a radio  loud quasars a a redshift @xmath5 characterised by a large radio to optical flux ratio ( i.e. the so  called radio  loudness ) @xmath6 . yi14 selected the source through optical  ir selection criteria based on sdss and wise photometric data ( wu et al . 2012 ) , and then observed it spectroscopically in the optical and the ir .",
    "the ir spectrum revealed an absorbed broad ly@xmath7 line and a broad mgii line , that allowed to estimate the black hole mass of the objects though the virial method , yielding @xmath8 .",
    "if this were the real black hole mass , then the source would emit above the eddington limit .",
    "a very large black hole mass found in a jetted quasar at such large redshifts is somewhat puzzling .",
    "this is because it is commonly believed that the jet is associated with rapidly spinning black holes , in order to let the blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) mechanism work .",
    "but if this were the case , the efficiency of accretion would be large , implying that _ less _ mass is required to emit a given luminosity .",
    "the black hole would then grow at a slower rate , and it becomes problematic to explain large black hole masses at high redshifts ( see e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "this motivates our interest in jetted quasars at high redshifts with large black hole masses .    up to now the three blazars known at @xmath9",
    "are q0906 + 6930 ( @xmath10 ; romani et al .",
    "2004 ) , b2 1023 + 25 ( @xmath11 ; sbarrato et al . 2012 , 2013 ) , and sdss j114657.79 + 403708.6 ( @xmath12 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "all these sources have a well visible accretion disc emission in the ir  optical part of the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , including strong broad emission lines . a large radio ",
    "loudness @xmath13 is a good indicator of the alignment of their jets with the line of sight , that boosts the non  thermal emission because of relativistic beaming .",
    "values @xmath14 , as in the case of sdss 01310321 ( yi14 ) , make the source a good _ blazar candidate _",
    ", i.e. a source whose jet is seen under a viewing angle @xmath15 smaller than the beaming angle @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "this definition is somewhat arbitrary , but has the merit to divide in a simple way blazars from their _ parent population _ , i.e. quasars with jets pointing away from us .",
    "the divide at @xmath18 implies that for each blazar there are other @xmath19 sources of similar intrinsic properties but pointing elsewhere .",
    "however , the radio  loudness alone does not guarantee the classification of the source as a blazar : @xmath20 could in fact correspond to a source seen at @xmath21 , but with a particularly weak intrinsic optical luminosity , or , vice  versa , with a particular strong intrinsic radio  luminosity . to confirm the blazar nature of these high  redshift powerful sources we require also a strong and hard x  ray flux , because it is an additional signature of a small viewing angle ( due to the specific emission mechanism though to produce the x  ray emission , see dermer 1995 and sbarrato et al .",
    "for this reason , we asked and obtained a target of opportunity observation in the x  ray band with the _ swift _ satellite . in this letter",
    "we discuss these data in the broader context of the entire sed , deriving a robust estimate on the black hole mass and on the possible range of viewing angles .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath22 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "sdss 01310321 was selected by yi14 as a high@xmath0 quasars on the basis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the _ wide  field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) _ photometric data .",
    "the optical and near infrared spectroscopy performed by yi14 showed a broad ly@xmath7 and a mgii line , at @xmath5 . from the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ; becker , white & helfand , 1995 ) catalog the radio flux is 33 mjy at 1.4 ghz , corresponding to a @xmath25 luminosity of @xmath26 erg s@xmath23 .",
    "yi14 measured a radio loudness of @xmath27100 , by assuming that the radio  to  optical spectrum follows a @xmath28 power law , and calculating this way the flux at the rest frame frequencies of 5 ghz and 4400   ( kellerman et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the source is not detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _ satellite . in high@xmath0 and powerful radio sources , a radio  loudness equal or larger of 100 strongly suggests that we see the jet radiation with a small viewing angle .",
    "this makes sdss 01310321 a good blazar candidate , but in order to confirm it , we need to check if its x  ray emission , produced by the jet , is strong relative to the optical , and if its slope is harder than the one of a typical accretion disc corona ( i.e. @xmath290.81 ) .      to confirm the blazar nature of sdss 01310321 we asked to observe the source with the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "in fact the x  ray spectra of blazars beamed towards us are particularly bright and hard , with an energy spectral index @xmath30 [ @xmath31 ( see e.g. ghisellini et al .",

    "data of the x  ray telescope ( xrt , burrows et al . 2005 ) and the ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot , roming et al .",
    "2005 ) were downloaded from heasarc public archive , processed with the specific _ swift _ software included in the package heasoft v. 6.13 and analysed .",
    "the calibration database was updated on june , 2014 .",
    "we did not consider the data of the burst alert telescope ( bat , barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) , given the weak x  ray flux .",
    "from all the xrt observations we extract a single spectrum with total exposure of 20.2 ks .",
    "the mean count rate was @xmath32 .",
    "given the low statistics , the fit with a power law model with galactic absorption ( @xmath33  @xmath34 , kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) was done by using the likelihood statistic ( cash 1979 ) .",
    "the output parameters of the model were a spectral slope @xmath35 and an integrated de  absorbed flux @xmath36  erg  @xmath34  s@xmath23 .",
    "the value of the likelihood was 43.9 for 45 dof .",
    "the x  ray data displayed in the sed ( fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) have been rebinned to have at least @xmath37 in each bin .",
    "the source was not expected to be detected in any of the uvot filters , therefore the various observations were performed with different filters ( i.e. the observations were performed with the set - up  filter of the day \" ) , usually w1 or m2 uv  filters . in four cases also the @xmath38 filter was used , while the @xmath39 and @xmath40 filters were used once during the observation of november 12 , 2014 for a total exposures of 223 and 512 s , respectively .",
    "the source was never detected .",
    "for the @xmath40 filter we derive a 3@xmath41 upper limit of @xmath42 mag , corresponding to a flux @xmath43 mjy , without accounting for the likely absorption along the line of sight due to intervening matter .",

    "uv part of the sed , that can be well described as thermal emission from an accretion disc .",
    "the peak of this thermal emission lies redward of the hydrogen ly@xmath7 frequency ( vertical ocher line ) , implying that it is not an artefact of the absorption due to intervening ly@xmath7 clouds .",
    "this allows to derive the luminosity of the disc rather accurately : @xmath44 erg s@xmath23 .",
    "the ( rest frame ) peak frequency of the disc emission is @xmath45 hz .",

    "the _ wise _ low frequency detection point lies in  between the contribution of the accretion disc and the torus emission as modelled by ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2009 ) , who considered that the torus emits as a simple black  body at the temperature of @xmath50 k. in reality , the torus emission is more complex , with emission up to the sublimation dust temperature @xmath51 k ( e.g. peterson 1997 ) .",
    "calderone et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that composite _ wise _ data of a large sample of quasars were consistent with the sum of two black  bodies with average temperatures @xmath52=308 and 1440 k and similar luminosities .",
    "we have added a black  body with @xmath53 k to the model sed , having a luminosity similar to the colder black  body of 370 k. this scenario is probably still oversimplified , but can account for the observed data .",
    "[ zoom ] shows also that the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) point at @xmath54 ( rest frame ) is above the modelled disc emission .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the mgii broad emission line ( at 2800  rest frame ) , falling in the @xmath55 band filter of 2mass ( cohen et al .",

    "the contribution of all broad lines to @xmath57 is similar , with the exception of the ly@xmath7 whose contribution is about half the one calculated by francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "we then took the logarithmic average of the values derived separately for the mgii and the ly@xmath7 line ( see data in yi14 ) , assuming that we see only half of it ( i.e. the non absorbed part ) .",
    "we assumed an uncertainty of 0.2 dex on this estimate of @xmath46 .",
    "we can set a lower limit to the black hole mass of sdss 01310321 by assuming that its disc emits at or below the eddington level .",
    "this implies @xmath58 .",
    "yi14 , using the virial method ( e.g. wandel 1997 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) applied to the mgii broad line , derived @xmath59 , and concluded that the source is emitting at a super  eddington rate ( they also considered @xmath47 as the disc luminosity ) .",
    "optical sed of the source shows a peak and has a low frequency slope consistent with the emission from a simple , shakura & sunyaev disc ( 1973 ) model .",
    "[ sed ] shows that the non  thermal , possibly highly variable , continuum is not contributing to the ir  uv flux .",
    "since the accretion disc is much less variable than the jet emission , we expect that the ir ",
    "uv data , although not simultaneous , give a good description of the disc emission .",
    "this depends only on @xmath60 and the mass accretion rate @xmath61 .",
    "the latter is traced by the total disc luminosity @xmath62 , where @xmath3 is the efficiency , that depends on the last stable orbit , hence on the black hole spin ( with @xmath63 and @xmath64 appropriate for a non rotating and a maximally spinning black hole , respectively ; thorne 1974 ) .",

    "@xmath60 implies a larger disc surface , hence a lower maximum temperature .",
    "therefore a larger @xmath60 shifts the peak to lower frequencies .",
    "then the best agreement with the data fixes @xmath60 ( e.g. calderone et al .",

    "we do not satisfactorily account for the observed data , while the agreement between the data and the model is rather good within this mass range .",

    "if future _ nustar _ observations detect a high hard x  ray flux , then the @xmath82 , @xmath79 solution is preferred , and the total number of sources like sdss 01310321 should be @xmath84 in the same sky area .",
    "we believe that the black hole mass we found through the disc  fitting method is very reliable , since we do see the peak of the accretion disc emission red  ward of the ly@xmath7 limit .",
    "the only uncertainty concerns the use of a simple shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) model , that assumes a no ( or a modestly ) spinning black hole . on the other hand",
    "the resulting fit is good , and we stress that in the case of a fastly spinning black hole , with a corresponding high accretion efficiency @xmath3 , we would derive a _ larger _ black hole mass .",
    "this is because , for a given @xmath60 and @xmath61 , a kerr black hole would produce more optical  uv flux ( with respect to a non spinning black hole ) , then exceeding the observed data points at the peak of the optical  uv sed .",
    "one must lower @xmath61 , but this leads to under  represent the ir  optical point , that can be recovered by increasing the mass ( i.e. increasing the disc surface , implying a smaller temperature ) .",

    "[ salpeter ] shows the change of the black hole mass in time , assuming different efficiencies @xmath3 . if the black hole is not spinning , and @xmath85 , then it is possible to grow a black hole up to 11 billion solar masses starting from a @xmath86 seed if the accretion proceeds at the eddington rate all the time .",
    "but if @xmath64 , appropriate for a maximally spinning and accreting black hole ( thorne 1974 ) , then the growth is slower , and an eddington limited accretion can not produce a @xmath87 black hole at @xmath88 , unless the seed is @xmath89 at @xmath90 .",
    "this poses the problem : jetted sources are believed to be associated with fastly spinning black holes , therefore with highly efficient accretors .",
    "if the accretion is eddington limited , jetted sources should have black holes _",
    "lighter _ than radio  quiet quasars with not  spinning black holes .",
    "the solution to this puzzle can be that , when a jet is present , then not all the gravitational energy of the infalling matter is transformed into heat and then radiation , as suggested by jolley & kunzic ( 2008 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in this case",
    "the _ total _ accretion efficiency can be @xmath64 , but only a fraction of it ( @xmath91 ) goes to heat the disc , while the rest ( @xmath92 ) goes to amplify the magnetic field necessary to launch the jet ( by tapping the rotational energy of the black hole ) .",

    ", the jet _ is required _ if very large masses must be reached at large redshifts , together with a vast reservoir of mass that can be accreted . in this respect , the recent",
    "finding of punsly ( 2014 ) , namely that radio  loud objects have a _ deficit _ of uv emission with respect to radio  quiet quasar of similar disc luminosity , is very intriguing , pointing to the possibility that the inner part of the accretion disc around a kerr black hole is producing much less luminosity than expected , because the produced energy does not go into heating the disc , but in other forms , such as amplifying the magnetic field of the inner disc , a necessary ingredient to let the blandford & znajek process work efficiently .",
