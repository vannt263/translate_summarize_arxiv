    "because of magneto - rotational instabilities occurring in neutron stars during their birth , these stars could experience an abrupt change of rotational energy which could cause a loss of radiative energy and a gain in kinetic energy : @xmath16 a similar energy conversion but with a different radiative term is the basis of the  rocket model \" proposed by ( * ? ? ?",

    "he has pointed out that some form of magneto - rotational instability may be the cause of an exponential growth of the magnetic field ; but that once formed in the core collapse , this magnetic field may decay again through magnetic instabilities . in connection with the idea that neutron stars are born as magnetars , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* geppert & rheinhardt ( 2006 ) ) have discussed a magneto - hydrodynamical process that significantly reduces the initial magnetic field of a newly - born neutron star in fractions of a second . according to these authors ,",
    "such a field reduction is due to magneto - hydrodynamical instabilities , which seem to be inevitable if neutron stars are born as magnetars .",

    "the larmor formula for the power radiated by a time - varying magnetic dipole moment @xmath17 , and the estimate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the characteristic time in the exponential field decay law @xmath20 imply the equation @xmath21 which can be used together with the relation @xmath22 to yield the power radiated by a neutron star of radius @xmath23 and an initial magnetic field @xmath3 : @xmath24 consider now the specific time @xmath25 elapsed during the field decay from the initial value @xmath3 to the current surface magnetic field @xmath4 .",

    "it is expected that the angular frequency of neutron stars decreases during the field decay of this star .",
