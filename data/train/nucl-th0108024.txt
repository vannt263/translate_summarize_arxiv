    "effective field theories ( eft s ) offer the promise of a systematic treatment of few - nucleon systems at low - energies .",
    "( for a review , see : @xcite . )",
    "they are based on the existence of a separation of scales between those of the low - energy physics : momenta , energies , @xmath1 ( generically @xmath2 ) , and those of the underlying physics : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( generically @xmath6 ) .",
    "this makes it possible to systematically expand both the theory ( defined by a lagrangian or a potential ) and physical observables in powers of @xmath7 .",
    "such an expansion will be useful provided it converges rapidly enough .    for weakly interacting systems ( such as chiral perturbation theory in the zero- or one - nucleon sectors ) the terms in the expansion",
    "can be organised according to naive ( weinberg ) power counting .",
    "the order of a term @xmath8 in the theory is just @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in contrast for strongly interacting systems ( such as @xmath10-wave nucleon - nucleon scattering ) there can be new low - energy scales generated by nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "in such cases we need to resum certain terms in the theory and this leads to a new power counting @xcite , often referred to as ksw power counting .",
    "the theoretical tool which allows us to determine the power counting in these cases is the renormalisation group ( rg ) .",
    "the rg is an extension of simple dimensional analysis which has been used to study the scaling behaviour of systems in a wide range of areas of physics . in our work",
    "we use a wilsonian version of the rg @xcite .",
    "this has the following ingredients :    * impose a momentum cut - off , @xmath11 on the low - energy effective theory . *",
    "demand that observables be independent of the cut - off @xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to integrating out physics on momentum scales above @xmath12 .",
    "* rescale the theory , expressing all dimensioned quantities in units of @xmath12 . before doing this",
    ", we need to have identified all the important low - energy scales in our system .",
    "we can then follow the flow of the various coupling constants of the theory as @xmath13 .",
    "if there is a clear separation of scales , then the theory should flow towards a fixed point .",
    "this is because , for @xmath14 , the only scale left is @xmath12 and so the rescaled theory becomes independent of scale .    near a fixed point ,",
    "perturbations scale as powers of the cut - off , @xmath15 , and these define the power counting for the corresponding terms in the theory : @xmath16 .",
    "the sign of @xmath17 can be used to classify these terms :    * @xmath18 : irrelevant perturbation , flows towards the fixed point as @xmath13 , * @xmath19 : marginal perturbation ( or `` renormalisable '' in field - theory terminology ) , leads to logarithmic flow with @xmath12 , * @xmath20 : relevant perturbation , flows away from the fixed point as @xmath13 , making the point an unstable one .",
    "the application of these ideas to two - body scattering by short - range forces can be found in ref .",
    "two fixed points were found : a trivial one describing a system with weak scattering , and a nontrivial one describing a system with a bound state at zero energy .",
    "the expansion around the nontrivial one is organised by ksw power counting .",
    "it is in fact just the effective - range expansion @xcite , reinvented in modern languange as an eft .",
    "scattering by short - range interactions in the presence of a known long - range potential @xmath21 can be treated by distorted - wave theory .",
    "we write the full scattering matrix as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the scattering matrix for @xmath21 alone and @xmath24 is the corresponding green s function .",
    "the operator @xmath25 describes the scattering between distorted waves of @xmath21 . in terms of a short - range potential @xmath26",
    ", it satisfies the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath27    we regulate this equation by cutting off @xmath24 in the basis of distorted waves @xcite , @xmath28 ( here @xmath29 denotes the on - shell relative momentum for two particles of mass @xmath30 . ) the use of this basis is crucial for the identification of the scaling behaviour .",
    "since the long - range potentials of interest are generally singular as @xmath31 , we can not represent the short - range interaction by a simple @xmath32-function at the origin .",
    "instead we choose a @xmath32-shell form , @xmath33 note that we have allowed the potential to be energy ( @xmath34 ) dependent .",
    "however we have not included momentum dependence since , for the pure short - range - case , this was found to affect only the off - shell behaviour of scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we require that @xmath35 vary with @xmath12 to keep the fully off - shell dw scattering matrix @xmath25 independent of cut - off .",
    "rescaling the resulting differential equation gives us a dw version of the rg equation @xcite .",
    "to illustrate these ideas we apply them here to a specific example : a repulsive @xmath0 potential , @xmath36 this potential is analogous to the interaction in a three - body system such as quartet @xmath37 scattering , in the limit of an infinite two - body scattering length @xcite .",
    "it is scale independent and so should be treated as part of a fixed point ( and resummed to all orders ) .",
    "it acts in @xmath10-waves like a centrifugal barrier with `` angular momentum '' @xmath38 the corresponding dw s are bessel functions @xmath39 of noninteger order .",
    "the requirement that @xmath25 be independent of cut - off leads to a differential equation for @xmath35 , @xmath40 provided @xmath41 the dw factors scale as powers of @xmath12 : @xmath42 .",
    "we can then rescale , defining a dimensionless potential @xmath43 and on - shell momentum @xmath44 , to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ vde ] ) as an rg equation for @xmath45 .",
    "we have found two - fixed points of this equation :    * the trivial one , @xmath46 .",
    "perturbations around this are of the form @xmath47 and can be assigned an order @xmath48 . * a nontrivial one .",
    "perturbations around this are of the form @xmath49 and can be assigned an order @xmath50 .",
    "all perturbations around the trivial point are irrelevant .",
    "in contrast , the nontrivial fixed point is unstable ; there is always at least one relevant perturbation .",
    "the method outlined here makes it possible to determine the power counting for the short - range interactions in the presence of a known long - range potential .",
    "a crucial feature is that the cut - off is applied in the basis of dw s .",
    "one should not try to regulate the long - range as well as the short - range potential .",
    "for the example described here , the repulsive @xmath0 potential , this leads ( appropriately for prague ) to a baroque power counting involving non - integer orders . nonetheless the terms in the eft remain in one - to - one correspondance with observables . for the expansion around the nontrivial fixed point these are the terms of a dw ( or `` modified '' ) effective - range expansion @xcite .",
    "if we write the full phase shift as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is due to @xmath21 alone , then this expansion has the form @xmath53=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_{2n}\\hat p^{2n},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the coefficient of the perturbation of order @xmath55 in the potential .",
    "we have also applied this method to the coulomb potential , elucidating the power counting for the results of kong and ravndal @xcite , and the attractive @xmath0 potential @xcite . in the latter case , one has to make the scattering for @xmath21 alone well - defined before the method can be applied .",
    "this is done by choosing a self - adjoint extension @xcite or , more physically , by including a short - range potential as part of @xmath21 .",
    "the need for such an interaction has also been found in the corresponding three - body problems @xcite .",
