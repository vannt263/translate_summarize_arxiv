    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has become the observational tool of excellence for probing the statistical nature of inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "the small deviations from homogeneity which have been detected by over two dozen different experiments can be directly related to the primordial origin of perturbations in the early universe and therefore to fundamental physics at very high energies .",
    "a new threshold was crossed in the experimental forum with the high resolution , high sensitivity mapping of significant fractions of the cmb sky by the boomerang ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) and maxima ( hanany et al . 2000 ) experiments .",
    "a careful analysis of the variance of fluctuations in these maps has led to accurate estimates of the angular power spectrum , far surpassing previous experimental analyses on small angular scales . more recent results from boomerang ( netterfield et al .",
    "2002 , ruhl et al .",
    "2002 ) , maxima ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ) , and from other experiments like dasi ( halverson et al . 2002 ) , cbi ( pearson et al .",
    "2002 ) , vsa ( grainge et al . 2002 ) , acbar ( kuo et al . 2002 ) and archeops ( benoit et al . 2002 ) have posed our knowledge of the cmb angular power spectrum on even more solid ground .",
    "however , there is more information in the cmb fluctuations than what is provided by its power spectrum alone . the standard way to extract",
    "this information is to analyse high signal to noise maps of the cmb field like those already produced by boomerang or the ones that the map satellite is expected to provide shortly",
    ".    there is , therefore , strong motivation to attempt a more detailed study of the cmb sky ; in principle one would like a complete characterisation of the probability distribution function of the fluctuations in the cmb with the hope that it might probe more fundamental features of the origin of structure in the universe",
    ". for example one relatively stringent test of whether the origin of fluctuations is due to a standard , single - field inflationary model is if the cmb is a realization of a nearly gaussian distribution @xcite , while other models like the curvaton might lead to a much larger non - gaussian contribution @xcite .",
    "many secondary anisotropies like the ostriker - vishniac ( ov ) effect @xcite and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite can introduce measurable non - gaussianity while foregrounds and systematics may contribute as well .",
    "a standard method of parametrising an arbitrary probability distribution function is in terms of all its higher order moments . in the case of statistically homogeneous and isotropic fields",
    "it is more convenient to consider moments of the fourier transform of the field ; these symmetries will impose a set of selection rules which pick out the true degrees of freedom .",
    "the past few years have seen initial attempts at constraining these moments by measuring them with the available data .",
    "a series of analyses of the bispectrum ( the cubic moment ) of the cobe data have revealed the presence of a non - gaussian systematic @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed with an analysis of the trispectrum , the quartic moment @xcite .",
    "but no primordial non - gaussianity was detected .",
    "on smaller angular scales analyses of the qmap and qmask@xcite and maxima @xcite data have shown that their observations are consistent with the assumption that the cmb anisotropies are the result of an isotropic gaussian random process .",
    "the analyses of these data sets have also revealed that statistical methods may be sensitive to the data processing pipeline . moreover ,",
    "different technical issues must be confronted if one is considering finite sky coverage as opposed to full sky coverage .",
    "the trispectrum , which we consider in this study , probes a rather different kind of non - gaussianity than the bispectrum ; @xcite found it to be very sensitive to point sources and @xcite showed it to be a powerful probe of the ov effect .",
    "it can also be used to detect weak lensing in the cmb @xcite . in particular , as described in @xcite , weak lensing does not introduce a three - point correlation function , meaning that its expected bispectrum is zero .",
    "the first non trivial higher order correlation function to detect weak lensing effects is the trispectrum . using the trispectrum to test for non - gaussianity in high - resolution cmb maps",
    "complements therefore other analyses using the bispectrum , like @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve , extend and apply the method for estimating the trispectrum first proposed in kunz _",
    "( 2001 ) where it was applied to the full sky map produced by the cobe satellite .    using techniques developed for performing the operation in pixel space",
    "@xcite we present a formalism which can easily be extended to high @xmath0s and discuss a robust method for identifying an orthogonal set of estimators in the full - sky case .",
    "we then discuss the various numerical and statistical problems one faces when analysing finite sky coverage .",
    "we finally use the boomerang data as a test case to extract the first estimate of the trispectrum on sub - degree angular scales .",
    "in this section we present the notation that will be used throughout this work .",
    "we start with a temperature anisotropy field defined on the sphere , @xmath1 ; it may be expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions , @xmath2 : @xmath3 for any theory of structure formation , the @xmath4 coefficients are a set of random variables ; we shall restrict ourselves to theories which are statistically homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath5 of the temperature anisotropies is then defined by @xmath6 if we consider the 3-point function of the temperature field , we obtain the bispectrum , defined as @xmath7 the term ( @xmath8 ) is a wigner 3j symbol , which arises due to the `` selection rules '' of the moments .",
    "following the same steps , we can construct the 4-point function and the associated trispectrum .",
    "we represent the rotationally invariant solution for the trispectrum as in @xcite : @xmath9 using the orthogonality properties of the wigner 3j symbols and the relation @xmath10 , we can invert the equation ( [ eqn : eq4 ] ) to obtain the estimator @xmath11    the term @xmath12 represents the unconnected gaussian contribution and it is given in ( hu 2001 ) as : @xmath13 \\nonumber \\label{eqn : gaus_term}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the term @xmath14 is the connected part of the angular trispectrum and its expectation value is exactly zero for a gaussian field .",
    "this means that the connected part is sensitive to the presence of non gaussianities .",
    "the unconnected term is non - zero only for @xmath15 or @xmath16 , but only with full sky coverage . in the case of incomplete sky coverage the unconnected terms",
    "can contaminate all other modes .",
    "we will discuss this situation in section ( [ hires ] ) .    for the purpose of this work",
    "we have not computed the possible trispectrum components .",
    "we concentrated only on the simpler case @xmath17 , i.e. the diagonal component .",
    "recent papers have investigated in detail the power of the diagonal trispectrum in the presence of some non - gaussian signals mentioned in the introduction .",
    "in particular , @xcite has shown that for simulated point - source maps the diagonal trispectrum is much more powerful than the nearly diagonal estimator ( @xmath18 ) , even though the latter does not contain a gaussian contribution .",
    "also , in @xcite it is discussed how the ov effect generates a signature on the diagonal tispectrum which could easily be detected on the arcminute scales probed by the planck mission .",
    "finally it should be noticed that computing all components of the trispectrum is a serious computational challenge .",
    "many modes are also correlated due to the limited sky coverage . for these reasons",
    "we have decided to restrict this analysis to the case of @xmath17 .",
    "we start with the method described in @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are the components of the trispectrum that we wish to estimate , and @xmath21 is a tensor which we have to determine in order to construct an estimator for @xmath20 .",
    "the geometrical considerations stated above , together with the required symmetries with respect to the interchange of @xmath22 pairs suggest @xmath23 although the @xmath24s satisfy all the correct symmetries , they define an over - complete basis . to correct for this deficiency we define an orthonormalised set of tensors @xmath25 where the matrix @xmath26 is derived from the required property that the @xmath21 be orthogonal with respect to the product given in equation ( 5 ) of kunz et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "the estimator of the trispectrum is then given by @xmath27 note that there are only @xmath28 independent estimators due to the symmetry properties of the @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper we will consider the `` normalised '' trispectrum used in kunz _",
    "et al _ ( 2001 ) where we divide each estimate of the trispectrum by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "its statistical properties are equivalent to the ones of the unnormalised estimator , and it is more robust with respect to fluctuations in the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will be focusing on a high - resolution map with incomplete sky coverage , in particular the boomerang data set .",
    "this leads to a set of algorithmic problems which did not have to be addressed in kunz _",
    "et al _ ( 2001 ) .",
    "the three problems we wish to highlight are :    * speed : * : :    the numerical evaluation of wigner 3j coefficients for large values of    @xmath0 becomes time consuming and practically unfeasible .    indeed beyond the cobe resolution of a maximum @xmath0 of    approximately 25 it is not possible to estimate the    @xmath31 sufficiently rapidly for a robust    monte carlo assessment of the statistics .",
    "* gaussian contamination : * : :    the finite sky coverage will induce correlations between the    estimators with different values of @xmath0 and    @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "all    estimators may be heavily contaminated by the gaussian ( or    disconnected ) contributions to the maps .",
    "* correlations : * : :    the correlations between modes in the cut sky mean that the    @xmath31 will be even more correlated than    in the full sky case .",
    "we shall now focus on the solutions we propose to these three problems      we have opted to use the method described in @xcite for calculating @xmath31 : we define a new set of sky maps weighted in rings centred around a point @xmath34 : @xmath35 to implement this method we start with the relation ( [ eqn : eq10 ] ) and we use the relation ( [ eqn : eq1 ] ) to express the temperature @xmath36 as a function of spherical harmonics and the relation : @xmath37 to express also the legendre polynomials as a function of spherical harmonics . combining them with equation ( [ eqn : eq10 ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath38 the @xmath39 calculation is quite fast because we can use the fast fourier transform on rings of equal latitude ( muciaccia et al 1997 ) .",
    "we can then rewrite equation ( [ eqn : eq5 ] ) in terms of this new set of sky maps ( komatsu 2002 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 y^{\\ast}_{lm}(\\hat{\\bf n})}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we expand the wigner 3j symbols in terms of spherical harmonics and use the addition theorem we obtain : @xmath42 where @xmath43 we have thus computed a set of @xmath31 which we can orthonormalise to get the estimator for the trispectrum @xmath44 .",
    "this method is very fast , especially when estimating the trispectrum at high values of @xmath0 .",
    "note that direct evaluation of the wigner 3j coefficients , e.g. by recurrence relations , would result in an @xmath45 problem , requiring @xmath46 operations for @xmath47 .",
    "kunz _ et al _ ( 2001 ) found that the purely gaussian contribution to the trispectrum ( the disconnected part ) corresponds to the @xmath48 term . by orthogonalising all other estimators with respect to this tensor",
    "it is possible to remove the gaussian contribution exactly on a map by map basis .",
    "the resulting estimators are only sensitive to non - gaussian contributions , i.e. in the case of gaussian skies they would have a zero expectation value .",
    "additionally , the variance of this estimator is shown to be minimal @xcite . in the cut sky case ,",
    "there are strong cross correlations between components of the trispectrum with different values of @xmath0 and @xmath33 . in this case , the orthogonalisation method fails .",
    "given that the gaussian contribution to the trispectrum may be much larger than the non - gaussian contribution , it is essential that we remove it as completely as possible nonetheless .    to overcome these problems we have chosen to employ the following monte carlo scheme : we generate an ensemble of maps with the same angular power spectrum , sky coverage and noise as the data maps we want to analyse .",
    "we estimate the @xmath31 from each map and calculate the mean of these quantities over the whole ensemble .",
    "let us denote this mean by @xmath49 .",
    "we then use this quantity to correct for the gaussian contamination in the estimate of the trispectrum from the data by defining @xmath50 .",
    "note that , by so doing , we are removing the gaussian contamination before performing the full - sky orthogonalisation , i.e. before multiplying by @xmath51 .",
    "the fact that there is only limited sky coverage also implies that there will be correlations between values of the trispectrum at different @xmath0s .",
    "this is shown in section [ results ] below . to strongly suppress the correlations and to end up with a simple covariance matrix , we consider band averaged values of the trispectrum . since there is no a priori given band width ,",
    "we study the cases of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the choice @xmath57 is consistent with previous analyses of the boomerang power spectrum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this way we can check the sensitivity of the results to the chosen band size .",
    "the process we use is basically the same as in a number of previous analyses @xcite .",
    "we generate an ensemble of gaussian maps with the same angular power spectrum and noise property as estimated from the boomerang data and the same sky coverage .",
    "we then apply our estimators to the set of maps to obtain a distribution for each estimator in the gaussian case .",
    "in particular we characterise the full distribution in terms of the mean values of the estimators and the covariance matrix between them .",
    "these quantities are used to define a standard multivariate @xmath58 as a goodness of fit .",
    "the estimators of the trispectrum are then evaluated from the boomerang data . in section 5",
    "we will discuss their behaviour .",
    "the goodness of fit of these estimators is compared against its distribution for a _ new _ ensemble of gaussian maps . from this comparison",
    "we can quantify the confidence with which the data can be said to be gaussian from the point of view of our estimator .",
    "it is clear that the numerical details of this process must be well understood if we are to believe in our results .",
    "we focus on the particularities of the analysis in this paper which differ from previous analyses .",
    "it is important to compare the results using this hybrid pixel / harmonic analysis with the standard methods which have been used before .",
    "we do so by looking at the two lower order statistics , i.e. we have calculated the power spectrum @xmath5 and the bispectrum @xmath59 using this new approach as well as summing up the 3j symbols .",
    "the relevant expressions are : @xmath60 and ( spergel et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath61    we have compared the @xmath5 and @xmath59 using these expressions with the standard results obtained using @xmath4 and the wigner 3j symbols , for a maximum @xmath0 value of @xmath62 . using a set of cmb gaussian maps with the best fit power spectrum measured by boomerang @xcite and a pixel resolution of @xmath63 we have found that the bispectrum obtained with @xmath39 is affected by a pixelisation effect for high values of @xmath0 ( while the power spectrum shows no difference ) . to check for this ,",
    "we have done the same analysis with higher resolution ( @xmath64 ) and have found that the pixelisation effect vanishes .",
    "given that we are restricted to the pixelisation level of the data , we can use the comparison of the two estimates of the bispectrum to define a maximum @xmath0 out to which we can trust the new estimate of the trispectrum .",
    "note that it is computationally intractable to perform such a comparison in terms of the trispectrum , although this would be preferable . from fig .",
    "[ pix_eff ] one can see that discrepancies arise for @xmath65 and we chose not to estimate the trispectrum beyond @xmath66 , leaving a conservative margin as we did not test the trispectrum itself .",
    "furthermore , we chose not to consider any @xmath0 below 100 because the boomerang data are not very sensitive to these modes , due to limited sky coverage and data filtering .",
    "another novelty in our analysis ( as compared to that of kunz et al .",
    "2001 ) is the method for constructing @xmath67 .",
    "there , a gram - schmidt ( gs ) procedure was used to calculate the orthonormal transformation matrix @xmath67 . due to",
    "the inherent instability of the gs procedure , it is not applicable to large matrices , i.e. for large @xmath0 .",
    "we have opted therefore to use an alternative orthonormalisation method .",
    "we subtract the @xmath68 part and use a jacobi routine to obtain a spectral decomposition ( sd ) of the remaining matrix .",
    "the eigenvectors of the non - vanishing eigenvalues form then the transformation matrices .",
    "this method is robust and , moreover , gives us an unambiguous procedure for ordering the estimators through the different eigenvalues . as a strong consistency test",
    "we have applied our trispectrum code to the cobe data and compared the results with those of @xcite .",
    "the results of the sd method lie , up to a possible sign change , very close to the original ones ( see figure [ cobe ] ) . in any case , the statistical significance of the results ( and the conclusions one can extract ) are the same as in kunz et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "we advocate the use of the sd method from now on , even in the case of analyses limited to low @xmath0s .    for our analysis",
    "we have used the best four of the six @xmath69  ghz channels of the boomerang 1998 flight ; we naively coadd the data taken at the scan speed of @xmath70 degree per second ( @xmath70 dps ) .",
    "we simulate three sets of 1000 gaussian maps each .",
    "in fact , we need three statistically independent ensembles of simulated maps for our analysis : one to estimate the gaussian contribution described above , another to estimate our estimator s covariance matrix and a third one to perform the actual comparison with real data . to produce the maps we follow the very same steps used during the real boomerang data reduction . to generate a map we use timestream simulations created with the actual flight pointing and transient flagging .",
    "the signal component of these time streams is generated from simulated gaussian cmb maps , while the noise component is from gaussian realizations of the measured detector noise power spectrum .",
    "the noise spectrum is determined using the iterative procedure described in ferreira @xmath71 jaffe ( 2000 ) and netterfield et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    to reduce the effects of @xmath72 noise on this naively binned map , a brick - wall highpass fourier filter",
    "is first applied to the timestream at a frequency of @xmath73  hz .",
    "a notch filter is also applied between 8 and 9  hz to eliminate a non - stationary spectral line in the data .",
    "this only affects angular scales well above @xmath74 and is therefore irrelevant for our analysis .",
    "the coaddition of several channels is achieved by averaging the maps ( both from the data , and from the monte - carlos of each channel ) .",
    "each channel has a slightly different beam size , which is taken into account in the generation of the simulated maps .",
    "we select the most central region of the scan by applying an elliptical mask as in ( netterfield et al .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath75 of the full sky .",
    "the mask selects a region of approximately uniform coverage and high signal to noise and comprises @xmath76 pixels of size @xmath77 each in the healpix pixelization scheme ( grski et al .",
    "we refer the reader to ruhl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a thorough description of a simulation pipeline ( based on the master / faster algorithms described in @xcite ) very similar to the one used here .",
    "-1.3 in    -1.4 in    to show in detail the method proposed in sections 2 and 3 we are going to discuss the results obtained at each step from both the data and the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we start with the estimate of the @xmath78 without gaussian corrections . in the top panel of figure [ res1 ]",
    "we plot @xmath78 as a function of @xmath0 for selected values of @xmath33",
    ". we can highlight two features .",
    "firstly the @xmath79 are highly correlated for adjacent values of @xmath0 due to the finite sky coverage , as expected . secondly , and because of the finite sky coverage , there is a strong contamination from the disconnected component of the trispectrum .",
    "this is evident in the fact that the values of @xmath79 scatter about the @xmath80 and that the @xmath81 confidence limits are not centred about zero . as one would expect the lower the value of @xmath33 ,",
    "the more contaminated the estimate is by the disconnected part . as advocated in section",
    "[ hires ] , we correct for the contamination due to the disconnected component by using a monte carlo ensemble ( of 1000 realizations ) to generate a correction .",
    "this can be seen as a bias which must be subtracted off all estimates of @xmath79 with @xmath82 . in the bottom panel of figure [ res1 ]",
    "we plot the `` gaussian corrected '' estimate of @xmath79 with corresponding @xmath81 confidence limits .",
    "as expected the estimates now scatter around zero , while the confidence limits , although not necessarily symmetric around the @xmath0 axis are much more centred .",
    "the remaining asymmetry is merely a manifestation that for low @xmath33s the distribution of the @xmath79 is slightly skewed .",
    "-1.3 in    given that we will be working with normalised estimates of the trispectrum ( as in kunz _",
    "et al _ 2001 ) it is illustrative to plot the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath83 for a few values of @xmath33 .",
    "we do this in figure [ res2 ] .",
    "one can see the dependence on @xmath33 of the @xmath81 confidence intervals , i.e. the @xmath0 value of minimum scatter depends on @xmath33 .",
    "let us now proceed to the orthornomalised estimators , @xmath84 ; a selection of estimators are plotted for a choice of @xmath32s in figure [ res3 ] .",
    "as noted above , the @xmath32 are limited to @xmath85 , and we see a clear suppression of the high @xmath32 values for each @xmath0 ( or , in the case of the figure , of the low @xmath0 values for fixed @xmath32 ) , as the maps with limited sky coverage contain less information than full sky maps .",
    "-1.3 in    -1.4 in    .probability that the gaussian models have a @xmath58 greater than the data value for both the trispectrum estimators and for different bin widths in @xmath0 and @xmath32 .",
    "[ tab : res ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once we have calculated the trispectrum estimators both for the boomerang data and for the monte - carlo simulations , we can proceed to get the @xmath58 distribution for the simulated gaussian maps and compare it to the data .",
    "we used two different approaches : one taking as estimator @xmath84 ( the orthogonalised trispectrum corrected for gaussian contamination and normalised to @xmath86 ) and the other one taking its absolute value @xmath87 .",
    "we construct a standard multivariate @xmath58 as : @xmath88 deriving the expectation values @xmath89 and the covariance matrix @xmath90 from one of the two remaining monte - carlo ensembles .",
    "as discussed earlier , we do nt sum over all @xmath0 and @xmath32 , but bin both @xmath32 and @xmath0 , varying the size of the bins .",
    "finally we calculate the @xmath58 distribution from the last ensemble of gaussian maps .    in figures",
    "[ chi_abs ] and [ chi_nofs ] we show the @xmath58 distribution derived from @xmath62 gaussian realizations compared to the boomerang data for both estimators and for different bin widths .",
    "the probability @xmath91 that a gaussian map has a larger @xmath58 than the boomerang map is given in table [ tab : res ] .",
    "although the values vary considerable with the choice of bin - widths , none of them is below @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "we conclude that the trispectrum does not detect any non - gaussianity in the coadded boomerang 150  ghz maps .",
    "we have applied an improved version of the method of @xcite for measuring the trispectrum to the four best 150  ghz boomerang maps . to this end , we used maps containing only one multipole each to avoid computing the wigner 3j symbols and subtracted the average gaussian contribution using an ensemble of simulated maps .",
    "we then orthogonalised these maps and normalised them to @xmath5 .",
    "we then binned the resulting trispectrum values with a variety of different bin sizes , and computed the @xmath58 value , using a full covariance matrix estimated from a second ensemble of simulated gaussian maps . when comparing the data @xmath58 value to the gaussian realizations",
    "( obtained from a third ensemble of simulated gaussian maps ) we concluded that the trispectrum does not detect any deviations from gaussianity .",

    "we have studied for the first time the trispectrum of real cmb data with sub - degree resolution .",
    "the main problem encountered was the limited sky coverage , which introduces strong correlations , and prevents the use of orthogonalisation to remove the gaussian ( connected ) part of the trispectrum .",
    "we expect therefore that the map and planck satellites will be able to improve on this analysis considerably , but this study provides a proof of feasibility for measuring the trispectrum of full sky high resolution maps as well as first results on small angular scales .",
