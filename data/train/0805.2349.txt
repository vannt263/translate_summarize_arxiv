    "superfluidity is a phase of matter in which `` unusual '' effects are observed when liquids , typically of helium-4 or helium-3 , overcome friction by surface interaction when at a stage , known as the `` lambda point '' for helium-4 , at which the liquid s viscosity becomes zero .",
    "experiments have indicated that helium atoms have two stable isotopes @xmath0he and @xmath1he .",
    "@xmath1he contains two electrons , two protons and one neutron .",
    "hence it has a fractional spin and obey the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the liquid @xmath1he has two types of superfluid phases : phase a and phase b. in particular , if we apply a magnetic field on the liquid @xmath1he , then there will be a third superfluid phase , called the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the main objectives of this article are 1 ) to establish some dynamical ginzburg - landau models for @xmath1he with or without applied magnetic fields , and 2 ) to study superfluid dynamic transitions and their physical significance .",
    "consider the case without applied magnetic field .",
    "the modeling is based on two main ingredients as follows .    first , instead of using a single wave function @xmath3 , we use three wave functions to represent anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) state and the balian - werthamer ( bm ) state . more precisely , we introduce three complex valued functions @xmath4 to characterize the superfluidity of @xmath1he , with @xmath5 for the state @xmath6 , @xmath7 for the state @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for the state @xmath10",
    ". then we are able to formulate a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) energy in terms of these three wave functions and the density function @xmath11 of the normal fluid state .",
    "second , we use a unified time - dependent ginzburg - landau model for equilibrium phase transitions , developed recently by the authors @xcite , to derive a general time - dependent gl model for @xmath1he .    in a nutshell , the model is obtained by a careful examination of the classical phase transition diagrams and by using both mathematical and physical insights offered by a recently developed dynamical transition theory as briefly recalled in the appendix .",
    "the model of the case with applied magnetic field can be derived in the same fashion .    with the models in our disposal",
    ", we can study the dynamic phase transitions of liquid @xmath1he , and derive some physical predictions .    to be precise",
    ", we first recall the classical phase transition diagrams of @xmath1he , as shown in figure  [ f8.38 ] ; see among many others ginzburg @xcite , reichl @xcite and onuki @xcite .",
    "he in the case without an applied magnetic field.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    from this diagram , we see that there are two coexistence curves , with one separating the solid state and the phase @xmath12 and phase @xmath13 superfluid states , and the other separating the superfluid states and the normal liquid state .",
    "the transition crossing the coexistence curve between the solid and superfluid states is first order ( type - ii in the sense of dynamic classification scheme given in the appendix ) , and the transition crossing the coexistence curve between the superfluid and normal liquid states are second order ( type - i in the sense of dynamic classification scheme ) . in addition , the second transition between phase a and phase b superfluid states is first order ( type - ii ) .",
    "we would like to mention that the ginburg - landau theory with only one wave function can not describe this phase transition diagram , and this is one of the mains reasons that we need a new ginzburg - landau model as discussed above to study the phase transition dynamics for @xmath1he .",
    "the models established are analyzed using a recently developed dynamical transition theory , leading to some interesting physical predictions .",
    "here we address briefly the new results derived . for the case without the applied magnetic field , the main results obtained are synthesized in a theoretical @xmath14-phase diagram of @xmath1he given by figure  [ f8.41 ] .",
    "-phase diagram of @xmath1he : the region @xmath15 is the unstable domain , where the solid state and the superfluid state appear randomly depending on fluctuations . the curve @xmath16 is the first critical curve where phase transition between normal fluid and superfluid states occur.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    one prediction from our results is the existence of a unstable region @xmath15 , in which the solid state and the superfluid states @xmath12 and @xmath13 appear randomly depending on fluctuations . in particular , in @xmath17 , phase @xmath13 superfluid state and the solid may appear , and in @xmath18 the phase @xmath12 superfluid state and the solid sate may appear .",
    "another prediction is the possible existence of phase c superfluid state , which is characterized by the wave function @xmath9 , representing @xmath10 .",
    "however , phase c region is very narrow , which may be the reason why it is hard to be observed in experiments .",
    "also , the results predict that near the two triple points @xmath19 and @xmath20 , there is a possibility of the existence of two switch points , where the transition on the corresponding coexistence curve switches types at each switch point .",
    "the existence of such switch points depends on the physical parameters .    one important new ingredient for the analysis is a dynamic transition theory developed recently by the authors @xcite .",
    "with this theory , we derive a new dynamic phase transition classification scheme , which classifies phase transitions into three categories : type - i , type - ii and type - iii , corresponding respectively to the continuous , the jump and mixed transitions in the dynamic transition theory .",
    "the case with applied field can be addressed in the similar fashion ; see section v.    this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces a new dynamic model for liquid helium - m without applied magnetic field .",
    "the phase transition dynamics is given in section iii , and the type of transitions in different regimes are given in section iv .",
    "section v deals with the case with applied magnetic field , and section vi gives a summary on the physical predications of the new models .",
    "the superfluidity of liquid @xmath1he was found in 1971 by d. m. lee , d. d. osheroff , and r. c. richardson , and its transition temperature is @xmath21 under @xmath22 atm @xmath23pa ) .",
    "there are two superfluid phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 if there is no applied magnetic field .",
    "figure [ f8.38 ] provides the phase diagram of the liquid @xmath1he in the @xmath14-plane .",
    "because the atoms @xmath1he are fermions , to form the superfluid phase they must be paired to become bosons .",
    "when no magnetic field is applied , there are two pairing states : the anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) state and the balian - werthamer ( bw ) state , given respectively by @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath25 state corresponds to the superfluid phase @xmath12 , and the @xmath26 state to the phase @xmath13 .",
    "also , we call state @xmath27 as phase @xmath28 , which appears in the theory developed in this article .    we introduce three complex valued functions @xmath4 to characterize the superfluidity of @xmath1he , in which @xmath5 to the state @xmath29 to the state @xmath8 , and @xmath9 to the state @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the normal fluid density , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the densities of superfluid phases @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "then we have @xmath33 the total density of @xmath1he is given by @xmath34    physically , the states @xmath35 and @xmath9 are independent , and consequently there are no coupling terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 in the free energy density .",
    "since in the case without applied magnetic field @xmath5 and @xmath7 are equal , their coefficients in the free energy should be the same .",
    "thus , we have the following ginzburg - landau free energy for @xmath1he with @xmath39 :    @xmath40dx , \\label{8.223}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the coefficients depends on @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , there are regions @xmath48 @xmath49 in the @xmath14-plane @xmath50 such that @xmath51 , and @xmath52    it is known that for @xmath1he , @xmath53 is not monotone on @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath54pa , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is as shown in figure [ f8.38 ] . near the point",

    ", we infer from ( [ 8.223 ] ) the following time - dependent gl equations for the superfluidity of liquid @xmath1he :    @xmath58    the nondimensional form of ( [ 8.229 ] ) can be written as @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is determined by the state state solution of the form @xmath62 of ( [ 8.229 ] ) . by ( [ 8.224 ] ) the coefficients in ( [ 8.230 ] ) satisfy @xmath63    the boundary conditions are the neumann conditions @xmath64    when @xmath42 is a constant , the problem ( [ 8.230 ] ) with ( [ 8.232 ] ) can be reduced to the following system of ordinary differential equations : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67",

    "it is clear that the critical parameter curves @xmath70 are associated with the @xmath14-phase diagram of @xmath1he . as in the last section",
    "if we can determine the critical parameter curves @xmath70 @xmath71 , then we obtain the @xmath14-phase diagram .",
    "phenomenologically , according to the experimental @xmath14-phase diagram ( figure [ f8.38 ] ) , the parameter curves @xmath70 @xmath72 in the @xmath14-plane should be as schematically illustrated in figure [ f8.39](a)-(c ) .",
    "the combination of the diagrams ( a)-(c ) in figure [ f8.39 ] gives figure [ f8.40 ] , in which the real line @xmath73 stands for the coexistence curve of the solid and liquid phases , and @xmath16 for the coexistence curve of superfluid and normal liquid phases .",

    "we consider the dynamical properties of transitions for ( [ 8.233 ] ) in the unstable region .",

    "-phase diagram of @xmath1he in a magnetic field.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    as a magnetic field @xmath234 is applied , there is a new pairing state to appear , in which the spin of pairing atoms is parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this new state corresponds to the phase @xmath2 , and is expressed by @xmath236    we introduce the complex valued functions @xmath5 to the state @xmath237 to the state @xmath238 , and @xmath9 to this state @xmath239 .",
    "let @xmath240 stand for the densities of superfluid phases @xmath241 respectively .",
    "then we have @xmath242 and the total density of liquid @xmath1he in a magnetic field is given by @xmath243    thus , similar to ( [ 8.223 ] ) , for liquid @xmath1he with @xmath244 we give the ginzburg - landau free energy in the following form .",
    "for simplicity we take the nondimensional form :    @xmath245dx . \\label{8.251}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equations describing liquid @xmath1he with @xmath244 read @xmath246    where the coefficients satisfy that for any @xmath247 and @xmath248 , @xmath249    equations ( [ 8.252 ] ) should be the same as ( [ 8.230 ] ) for @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we assume that when @xmath39 , @xmath250    based on the physical facts , we also assume that @xmath251    when the magnetic field @xmath234 and the pressure @xmath42 are homogeneous on @xmath252 , the problem ( [ 8.252 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath253 where @xmath254 @xmath255 , and @xmath256 @xmath72 are as in ( [ 8.233 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath257 , and @xmath96 be that as shown in figure [ f8.39](a)-(c ) respectively . then ,",
    "due to ( [ 8.254 ] ) the curves @xmath258 in @xmath14-plane are schematically illustrated by figure [ f8.44 ] .",

    "then , under the conditions ( [ 8.237]),([8.238]),([8.253]),([8.254 ] ) and ( [ 8.256 ] ) , by using the same fashion as in theorem [ t8.15 ] and [ t8.16 ] , we can prove the following transition theorem for ( [ 8.255 ] ) .",
    "assume the conditions ( [ 8.237]),([8.238]),([8.253]),([8.254 ] ) and ( [ 8.256 ] ) , then for @xmath244 there exist two curve segments @xmath265 near @xmath172 and @xmath266 near @xmath173 in the @xmath14-plane as shown in figure [ f8.45 ] such that the following assertions hold true :    * the system ( [ 8.255 ] ) has a transition in curve segment @xmath267 with @xmath268 ( i.e. , the curve segment @xmath269 in figure [ f8.45 ] ) , which is type - i for @xmath270 , and is type - ii for @xmath271 .",
    "the transition solution is given by @xmath272 with @xmath273 * the system has a second transition from @xmath272 in the curve segment @xmath265 ( i.e. , @xmath274 , and the transition solution is as @xmath275 with @xmath276 and @xmath277 . *",
    "the system has a third transition from @xmath275 in the curve segment @xmath266 ( i.e. , @xmath278 , and the transition solution is @xmath279 with @xmath280 and @xmath277 .",
    "by carefully examining the classical phase transition diagrams and with both mathematical and physical insights offered by the dynamical transition theory , we derived two new models for superfluidity of @xmath1he with or without applied field . a crucial component of these two models is the introduction of three wave functions to represent anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) and the balian - werthamer ( bm ) states .",
    "then we have obtained a theoretical @xmath14-phase diagram of @xmath1he as shown in figure  [ f8.41 ] , based on the models and the dynamic phase transition analysis .",
    "a few main characteristics of the results are as follows .",
    "first , the analysis shows the existence of a unstable region @xmath15 , in which the solid state and the superfluid states @xmath12 and @xmath13 appear randomly depending on fluctuations . in particular , in @xmath17 , phase @xmath13 superfluid state and the solid may appear , and in @xmath18 the phase @xmath12 superfluid state and the solid sate may appear .",
    "second , theoretical analysis suggests the existence of phase c superfluid state , which is characterized by the wave function @xmath9 , representing @xmath10 . however , phase c region is very narrow , which may be the reason why it is hard to be observed in experiments .",
    "third , the curve @xmath16 is the first critical curve where phase transition between normal fluid and superfluid states occur .",
    "the curve @xmath113 is the coexistence curve between phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the curve @xmath108 is the coexistence curve between normal fluid state and the phase @xmath12 superfluid state , the curve @xmath110 is the coexistence curve between normal fluid state and the phase @xmath28 superfluid state , the curve @xmath126 is the coexistence curve between the phases @xmath13 and @xmath28 superfluid states .",
    "fourth , theorems  [ t8.15]-[t8.17 ] imply that near the two triple points @xmath19 and @xmath20 , there is a possibility of the existence of two switch points , where the transition on the corresponding coexistence curve switches types at each switch point .",
    "the existence of such switch points depends on the physical parameters .    in comparison to classical results",
    "as shown in figure  [ f8.38 ] , our results lead to the predictions of the existence of 1 ) an unstable region @xmath234 , 2 ) a new phase c in a narrow region , and 3 ) switch points .",
    "it is hoped that these predictions will be useful for designing better physical experiments and lead to better understanding of the physical mechanism of superfluidity .",
    "in this appendix , we introduce a new phase dynamic transition classification scheme to classify phase transitions into three categories : type - i , type - ii and type - iii , corresponding mathematically continuous , jump , and mixed transitions , respectively .      in sciences ,",
    "nonlinear dissipative systems are generally governed by differential equations , which can be expressed in the following abstract form let @xmath281 and @xmath282 be two banach spaces , and @xmath283 a compact and dense inclusion .",
    "hereafter we always consider the following nonlinear evolution equations @xmath284 where @xmath285 is unknown function , and @xmath286 is the system parameter .",
    "assume that @xmath287 is a parameterized linear completely continuous field depending contiguously on @xmath286 , which satisfies @xmath288 in this case , we can define the fractional order spaces @xmath289 for @xmath290 .",
    "then we also assume that @xmath291 is @xmath292 bounded mapping for some @xmath293 , depending continuously on @xmath286 , and @xmath294      a state of the system ( [ 5.1 ] ) at @xmath295 is usually referred to as a compact invariant set @xmath296 . in many applications",
    ", @xmath296 is a singular point or a periodic orbit .",
    "a state @xmath296 of ( [ 5.1 ] ) is stable if @xmath296 is an attractor ; otherwise @xmath296 is called unstable .",
    "[ d7.1 ] we say that the system ( [ 5.1 ] ) has a phase transition from a state @xmath296 at @xmath297 if @xmath296 is stable on @xmath298 ( or on @xmath299 ) and is unstable on @xmath300 ( or on @xmath298 ) . the critical parameter @xmath301 is called a critical point . in other words",
    ", the phase transition corresponds to an exchange of stable states .",
    "obviously , the attractor bifurcation of ( [ 5.1 ] ) is a type of transition .",
    "however , bifurcation and transition are two different , but related concepts .",
    "let @xmath302 be the eigenvalues ( counting multiplicity ) of @xmath303 , and assume that @xmath304    the following theorem is a basic principle of transitions from equilibrium states , which provides sufficient conditions and a basic classification for transitions of nonlinear dissipative systems .",
    "this theorem is a direct consequence of the center manifold theorems and the stable manifold theorems ; we omit the proof .",
    "let the conditions ( [ 5.4 ] ) and ( [ 5.5 ] ) hold true .",
    "then , the system ( [ 5.1 ] ) must have a transition from @xmath305 , and there is a neighborhood @xmath306 of @xmath307 such that the transition is one of the following three types :    * continuous transition : there exists an open and dense set @xmath308 such that for any @xmath309 , the solution @xmath310 of ( [ 5.1 ] ) satisfies @xmath311 * jump transition : for any @xmath312 with some @xmath165 , there is an open and dense set @xmath313 such that for any @xmath314 , @xmath315 for some @xmath316 independent of @xmath295 .",
    "* mixed transition : for any @xmath312 with some @xmath165 , @xmath317 can be decomposed into two open sets @xmath318 and @xmath319 ( @xmath320 not necessarily connected ) : @xmath321 , @xmath322 , such that @xmath323      the phase transitions for ( [ 5.1 ] ) at @xmath324 is classified using their dynamic properties : continuous , jump , and mixed as given in theorem  [ t5.1 ] , which are called type - i , type - ii and type - iii respectively .",
    "an important aspect of the transition theory is to determine which of the three types of transitions given by theorem [ t5.1 ] occurs in a specific problem .",
    "a corresponding dynamic transition theory has been developed recently by the authors for this purpose ; see @xcite .",
    "we refer interested readers to these references for details of the theory .",
    "consider a thermal system with a control parameter @xmath295 . by the mathematical characterization of gradient systems and the le chtelier principle , for a system with thermodynamic potential @xmath325 ,",
    "the governing equations are essentially determined by the functional @xmath325 . when the order parameters @xmath326 are nonconserved variables , i.e. , the integers @xmath327 then the time - dependent equations are given by @xmath328 for @xmath329 , where @xmath330 and @xmath331 satisfy @xmath332 the condition ( [ 7.31 ] ) is required by the le chtelier principle . in the concrete problem , the terms @xmath331 can be determined by physical laws and ( [ 7.31 ] ) .",
    "we remark here that following the le chtelier principle , one should have an inequality constraint .",
    "however physical systems often obey most simplified rules , as many existing models for specific problems are consistent with the equality constraint here .",
    "this remark applies to the constraint ( [ 7.37 ] ) below as well .",
    "when the order parameters are the number density and the system has no material exchange with the external , then @xmath333 @xmath334 are conserved , i.e. , @xmath335 this conservation law requires a continuity equation @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the flux of component @xmath333 , satisfying @xmath338 where @xmath339 is the chemical potential of component @xmath340 , @xmath341 and @xmath342 is a function depending on the other components @xmath343 @xmath38 .",

    "the above model covers the classical cahn - hilliard model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for multi - component systems , these @xmath347 play an important rule in deriving good time - dependent models .",

    "@xmath331 and @xmath347 satisfy ( [ 7.31 ] ) and ( [ 7.37 ] ) , respectively .",
