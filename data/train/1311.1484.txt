    "twitter is a public conversation site where millions of micro - bloggers post their short messages regularly . as part of the twitter ecosystem many independent software applications are developed to serve the needs of its diverse user base",
    "this accelerated its growth and allowed the service to establish a world - wide , and ever growing active user - base . on the other hand ,",
    "the infrastructure built for the easily automated access to the stream of messages combined with additional public user information , has attracted a scientific audience as well @xcite .",
    "although many interesting questions can be answered based on the messages and the registered relations of users , it is important to note that the complete data set of public sites is not freely available . in this paper",
    "we aim to overcome the sparsity of the accessible data stream by means of different aggregation techniques : over time and within geographic boundaries . as a result , instead of inspecting user - level interactions , we aim to analyze the rather robust communication network of the geopolitical units of the world .",
    "such country - level connections can reveal structural properties and a hierarchy of the regions . by adapting a simple information propagation model we can further differentiate the most efficient information sources of the world - as reflected in high volume of individual conversations .",
    "we used a data set collected from the freely available twitter stream during the second half of the year of @xmath0 @xcite . we refer to twitter users in this data set allowing public access to their geographical location information as the geo - users , and each one",
    "is located to a single fixed position @xcite .",
    "those that fell into unmapped territories ( _ e.g. _ , oceans ) were discarded from further analysis . by means of aggregation of their different forms of connections",
    "we create two different communication networks between geopolitical regions : the mention ( @xmath1 ) and the follower ( @xmath2 ) networks .    for creating the user - level follower graph we used @xmath3 links between @xmath4 geo - users identified as the most active ones .",
    "given their list , the additional follower relations were collected separately @xcite .",
    "the source of a following link is the followed user while its target is the follower .",
    "a network built using the inverse follower relation is also be meaningful , and can be used for showing the direction of interest . to create the user - level mention graph we used @xmath5 mention messages between @xmath6 geo - users .",
    "the source of a mention link is the sender while its target is the mentioned user .",
    "the aggregation of a user - level network to obtain a regional one is based on a division of the world into distinct geopolitical units , called regions .",
    "we opted to use countries , but in the case of the largest ones ( _ i.e. _ australia , canada , usa , brazil , china , russia and india ) their smaller administrative units are used in order to have a more balanced geographic division .",
    "after aggregation the regions become the new nodes of the graph with aggregated user counts , and the new edges are defined directed and weighted based on the respective sums of user level links between regions . for each",
    "network regions without any links were discarded from further analysis .    in this paper",
    "we aim to characterize the region - level communication .",
    "for this purpose both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are considered as static . for creating @xmath1 the geographic aggregation",
    "is preceded by an aggregation over time .",
    "this gives robustness against possible sampling fluctuations coming from the freely available twitter stream .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are represented by weighted and directed graphs .",
    "their adjacency matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 have non - negative entries and they are not symmetric .",
    "the largest entries in a row of @xmath7 or @xmath8 are usually localized in the diagonal , so a careful treatment of the regional and inter - regional communication is necessary .",
    "to describe inter - regional communication , we introduce the following characteristics . for the region , labeled by @xmath9 ,",
    "the total volume of incoming followers ( mentions ) is the sum of the off - diagonal entries in the @xmath9th column of the follower ( mention ) matrix and is denoted by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the total volume of outgoing followers ( mentions ) is the sum of the off - diagonal entries in the @xmath9th row of the follower ( mention ) matrix and is denoted by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . @xmath14 and @xmath15 of a region",
    "describe the total amount of channels of passive information flow originated in the communication environment of the region or in the region itself , respectively . @xmath16 and @xmath17 of a region",
    "are related to the activity of the region in conversation based active information flow - incoming and outgoing mentions describe how many conversation has been initiated in the communication environment of the region and in the region itself , respectively .    for a given region , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are not necessarily the same .",
    "if such an asymmetry occurs , the region becomes mainly information receiver or transmitter .",
    "the same is possible for the mention measures .",
    "here , the asymmetry between the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , describes different attitudes of a region with respect to starting conversations on twitter . to measure asymmetry in the follower and mention matrices ,",
    "we define type i and type ii asymmetry parameters .",
    "type i asymmetry parameter is defined for regions with @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) greater than zero and it is the fraction @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "type ii asymmetry parameter is defined for regions with @xmath14 ( @xmath16 ) greater than zero and it is the fraction @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .    for further analysis of inter - regional communication , we define @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the symmetric , unweighted follower and mention matrices by setting all diagonal entries of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) to zero and setting an off - diagonal entry to one if and only if at least one following ( mention ) between the corresponding regions has been recorded by our data mining methods .",
    "the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be recognized as adjacency matrices of unweighted graphs .",
    "we used @xmath24-shell decomposition of these graphs to determine their centrality properties .",
    "@xmath24-shell decomposition is a standard tool in graph theory to detect the core - periphery structure of a graph @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a set of nodes @xmath25 is called @xmath24-core of the graph @xmath26 if the degree of nodes in @xmath25 , with respect to the subgraph of @xmath26 induced by @xmath25 , is at least @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the largest set of nodes of @xmath26 with this property .",
    "the @xmath24-shell @xmath27 of the graph is defined by @xmath28 . throughout the paper",
    "we will say that the nodes of the shell with the highest @xmath24 belong to the _ core _ and all other nodes belong to the _ periphery_.    to relate the regional and the inter - regional communication to each other , we introduce the normalized interest measure ( nim ) and the normalized activity measure ( nam ) for the @xmath9th region as @xmath29 if the fractions are meaningful . here , @xmath30 is the following or the mention matrix .",
    "intuitively , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the empirical probability to find a following or a mention between region @xmath9 and one of its randomly chosen neighbors in the data set , if a following or a mention is found between two users , both of them localized in region @xmath9 , in the same data set .      to compare world - wide information spreading potential of regions we adapt one of the simplest propagation models , the @xmath33 model @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and modify it to be used on aggregated regional networks .",
    "the regional - sir ( @xmath34-@xmath33 ) model also assumes that at any given time @xmath35 an agent can be in one of the following states : susceptible , infected or recovered .",
    "the dynamics of single agents is governed by the rate of contact between agents , infection of a contacted susceptible agent and recovery of an infected one .",
    "after aggregation of single contact links the new weights are proportional to contact frequencies between pairs of regions on average . by fixing their absolute value",
    "a timescale can be defined .",
    "let @xmath30 denote either @xmath8 or @xmath7 - fixing the total number of regional nodes ( @xmath36 ) and the regional population counts ( @xmath37 ) accordingly .",
    "the state of the @xmath24th node is characterized by the number of its agents being in each of the three different states : @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is used as a compact notation for any of the three variables .",
    "we define the normalized edge weights to obtain region - level contact rates per source and per target agent : @xmath40 .",
    "a few intuitive rules can be translated into a set of deterministic equations governing the time evolution of the regions .",
    "we assume that the position of each agent and their total number per region are constant and contact is only possible between two agents in regions connected by an aggregated edge of non - zero weight .",
    "the number of contacts per unit time between two regions is assumed to be proportional to the @xmath41 weight of the connecting edge and susceptible agents can only receive information when contacted by infected agents .",
    "the number of infected agents decreases from recoveries at a given rate .",
    "after division by @xmath37 the relative regional state variables : @xmath42 and the new weight matrix : @xmath43 will appear in the corresponding equations : @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 scale the regional characteristic time of infection and recovery respectively .",
    "these parameters can further account for cultural and/or topic - related local differences , but in this paper we assume homogeneous distribution across the regions : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "we define the regional total infection at time @xmath35 as the sum of infections up until @xmath35 regardless of possible recoveries . for describing the global state we use average variables calculated from the global sums @xmath50 .",
    "the global infection time of the @xmath24th region ( @xmath51 ) is the time needed for @xmath52 to reach @xmath53 with @xmath54 and only the @xmath24th @xmath55 set to non - zero initial value .",
    "the follower matrix has been built with the usage of approximately @xmath56 followings between @xmath57 regions .",
    "@xmath58 of the followers addressed a twitter user from his or her own region .",
    "the sparsity of @xmath7 is approximately @xmath59 .",
    "the mention matrix contained approximately @xmath60 mentions from @xmath61 regions .",
    "@xmath62 of these mentions addressed a twitter user from his or her own region .",
    "the sparsity of @xmath8 was @xmath63 .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath16 reached their maximal value at california .",
    "the region with the maximal volume of @xmath15 and @xmath17 was united kingdom .",
    "it seems that california is the most active information source - @xmath64 of the total number of followings addressed a user located in california and @xmath65 of the mentions were used to try to initiate a conversation with a californian user . on the contrary ,",
    "united kingdom is the most effective information gatherer - @xmath66 of the followings have the island country as origin and @xmath67 of the mentions have been made by a user from united kingdom .",
    "it is interesting to ask the properties of the empirical distribution of the non - zero off - diagonal entries of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we found that these distributions closely follow an @xmath68 type power law .",
    "cutting away the entries with extremely small and extremely large magnitude , the best fit to the remaining data gave @xmath69 in the case of the follower and @xmath70 in the case of the mention matrix ( see fig .",
    "[ offdiagdistrib ] ) .",
    "as it is expected , higher value of self - followers of a region results in higher values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 of the same region .",
    "the same is true in the relationship of the self - mentions and @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "surprisingly , the dependencies also follow power laws ( see fig .",
    "[ selfvsfollowermention ] in the case of @xmath15 and @xmath71 ) . the exponent in the power law of the best fit to the data using the regions with at least one hundred and at most one million incoming or outgoing followers ( mentions ) in total",
    "is shown in table [ selfvsmentionfollowfit ] .",
    "this power law dependence could be the result of observations described in @xcite , but further studies would be needed to decide in reason of the aggregated nature of our data sets .",
    ".the exponents of the power law dependence of @xmath72 and @xmath73 as the function of self - communication . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we calculated the asymmetry measures for all regions , where they could be defined .",
    "we found that most of the regions have type i and type ii asymmetry parameters close to one , but there were serious deviations - @xmath74 and @xmath75 of the regions had type i and type ii follower asymmetry parameter greater than one .",
    "the same ratios are @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the case of type i and type ii mention asymmetry parameters .",
    "the median of type i and type ii asymmetry parameter is @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the case of the follower matrix and @xmath80 @xmath79 in the case of the mention matrix ( see fig .  [ fasymmetry ] and fig .",
    "[ masymmetry ] ) .",
    "the most frequent type i and type ii asymmetry parameters were located around @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the case of the follower matrix and @xmath78 and @xmath83 in the case of the mention matrix .",
    "the @xmath24-shell decomposition of @xmath22 and @xmath23 resulted in a massive core and a heavily articulated periphery ( see fig .  [ kshellworld ] ) . in the case of @xmath22 ,",
    "the core contains @xmath84 regions , each of them have at least @xmath85 neighbors . in the case of @xmath23 ,",
    "the core contains @xmath86 regions , each of them have at least @xmath87 neighbors .",
    "there is a strong difference between the structure of the periphery of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the periphery of @xmath22 contains @xmath88 regions and @xmath89 shells , and the average number of the regions in each periphery shell is low . on the contrary , the periphery of @xmath23 has one large shell and several small shells with only a few regions .",
    "the large shell in the periphery contains @xmath90 regions , each of which have at least @xmath91 neighbors in the graph of @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ exceptionalshell ] ) .",
    "we end our discussions about the structural properties of the follower and the mention graph by the examination of the nim and nam parameters . intuitively ,",
    "if a region is massively represented on twitter , its inter - regional activity is high .",
    "our aim with the introduction of nim and nam was to compare the trend of the alteration of the intensity of inter - regional communication , if we compare it to the activity of the regional communication . in order to achieve this , we studied nim and nam as the function of self - mentions and self - followers .",
    "we found that nim and nam decays along increasing regional communication .",
    "this is a rather surprising result , which means that the growth of the activity in the inter - regional communication with a randomly chosen neighbor of the communication environment of the region increases slower compared to the growth in the number of self followers and self mentions .",
    "we found that the rate of the decay is different along the periphery and the core .",
    "it seems that both of them follows a near power law , but with our current data , we can not say surely that the data set comes from the sampling of two different power law or from one convex function which differs from power law ( see fig .",
    "[ nimmf ] ) .",
    "we performed simple @xmath34-@xmath33 simulations with the primary goal of comparing the global spreading potential of regions .",
    "thus the initial conditions of a single run were set to a single source region being fully infected while the rest of the world was set to susceptible populations . in each case",
    "we performed pairs of simulations ( differing only in their time interval ) using @xmath7 and @xmath8 for creating the respective @xmath92 weight matrices of eq .",
    "[ eq : rsir ] .      as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fbetarsir ] shows how @xmath93 and @xmath94 depend on the choice of the homogeneous @xmath95 parameter .",
    "this global recovery rate is competing with the heterogeneous infection strengths as defined by the elements of @xmath92 . increasing its value between the minimal and the maximal matrix element decreases the efficiency of the infection .",
    "parameter on @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath7 was used with monaco set as the initial fully infected region.,width=336 ]      with the @xmath95 parameter being fixed , setting different regions as the source of infection for a single run simulation can lead to different results .",
    "the global infection potential of the region depends on its communication environment and its overall influence . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fitotglmonacovsca ] shows the difference between the global infection curves of two single runs using different sources but otherwise identical settings .",
    "we ran two series of single run simulations on the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 networks respectively with each of their regions set as the source .",
    "as outlier with low degrees . ] the resulting @xmath51 values",
    "were then assigned to the regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : invasionhists ] shows the distributions of the normalized values obtained after division by the respective maximal @xmath96 values .",
    "the median of the distribution of @xmath97 using @xmath7 is @xmath98 and using @xmath8 is @xmath99 .",
    "we find that the @xmath97 value of a region shows a clear negative correlation with its level in the hierarchy determined by the k - shell decomposition .",
    "this is illustrated by the fig .",
    "[ fig : invasionvsshell ] for @xmath8 and @xmath7 cases .",
    "this leads to our last definition .",
    "we call the effective core ( @xmath100 ) of a regional network the ensemble of regions belonging to the core and having @xmath97 smaller than any of the periphery values . this limit is @xmath101 for @xmath102 and results in a total number of @xmath103 member regions , while for @xmath104 the limit is @xmath81 and there are @xmath105 regions in it.as shown on fig .",
