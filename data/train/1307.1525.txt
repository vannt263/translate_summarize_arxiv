    "quantum mechanical treatment of a large number of important physical processes in various branches of physics and chemistry often requires solving the time - independent schrdinger equation involving a central potential .",
    "for example , the hellmann potential [ 1 ] has been used to study the electron - core or electron - ion interactions or the atomic inner - shell ionization problems , the short - range hulthn potential [ 2 ] is relevant in the nuclear and particle physics , the exponential cosine screened coulomb potential and the celebrated morse potential [ 3 ] found applications in solid - state physics , etc .",
    "unfortunately , the exact solutions of such systems are obtainable only in an exceptionally few instances and for almost all practical purposes , one has to take resort to the approximation methods or direct numerical techniques .",
    "therefore , almost ever since the inception of quantum mechanics , a large number of attractive formalisms have been proposed by many workers to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the spherically symmetric potentials , varying in terms of complexity , efficiency and elegancy .",
    "significant strides have been made over the years and it is still an active area of research .",
    "possibly the most widely used approximation schemes are the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory and the rayleigh - ritz variational method .",
    "both of these methods have witnessed outstanding successes to deliver physically meaningful results for many systems of interest .",
    "the other popular schemes are the 1/n expansion or many of its variants , the wkb method , etc .",
    "however the important shortcomings in some of these methods are that these often involve extensive and elaborate algebraic manipulations and the limited nature of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to be expressible in compact analytical forms .",
    "this work is devoted to a detailed calculation of the power - law and the logarithmic potentials which have relevant applications in the field of particle physics [ 4 - 13 ] .",
    "these potentials have been studied from various perspectives by several researchers employing a number of approximations ; e.g. , the wkb treatment [ 14 ] , the shifted 1/n expansion method [ 15 - 17 ] , the variational technique [ 18 ] , through an interpolation formula [ 19 ] and also by the direct numerical integration methods [ 14,19 ] .",
    "although several formally attractive and elegant formalisms exist in the literature , there is lack of accurate eigenvalues , especially those states characterized by higher quantum numbers and the eigenfunctions .",
    "here we employ a generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method for this purpose which has shown considerable promise in the field of static and dynamic processes in atomic and molecular systems recently ( see , e.g. , [ 20 - 23 ] ) involving mainly the coulomb potentials .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no attempts have been made so far to apply this scheme to other potentials of physical interest including the ones of current study .",
    "therefore the purpose of this article is two - fold , ( a ) to assess the validity and performance of the gps method for the power - law and logarithmic potentials , and ( b ) to determine accurately the bound state spectra of these systems .",
    "as is demonstrated in section 3 , it appears that the current method is capable of producing excellent results of these systems ; for the low as well as higher states . the layout of the article is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents a brief overview of the method of calculation . in section 3",
    "we first make some test calculations on some simple quantum mechanical systems and subsequently present the results for the power - law and the logarithmic potentials .",
    "finally we make a few concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we present an overview of the generalized pseudospectral method ( gps ) employed to solve the radial eigenvalue problem with the power - law and the logarithmic potentials .",
    "a more detailed account can be found in the refs .",
    "[ 24,25,20 - 23 ] .",
    "the desired radial schrdinger equation to be solved , can be written in the following operator form , @xmath2 where the hamiltonian includes the usual kinetic and potential energy operators , @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the symbols have their usual significances .",
    "the majority of the finite - difference discretization schemes for the solution of the radial schrdinger equation arising in these situations often require a large number of spatial grid points predominantly because of the uniform distributional nature of the spatial grid .",
    "the gps method , on the other hand allows the nonuniform and optimal spatial discretization , and as is mentioned below , maintains the same accuracy at both the small and large @xmath7 regions .",
    "therefore one has the advantage of working with a much lesser grid points compared to many other methods in the literature , and can have a denser mesh at the smaller @xmath7 while a coarser mesh at the large @xmath7 .",
    "the principal feature of this scheme is that a function @xmath8 defined in the interval @xmath9 $ ] can be approximated by the polynomial @xmath10 of order n so that , @xmath11 and the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",
    ", @xmath13 in the legendre pseudospectral method that we use in this study , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the @xmath16 are obtained from the roots of the first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath17 with respect to @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 the @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are called the cardinal functions and given by the following expression , @xmath21 satisfying the unique property @xmath22 .",
    "now the semi - infinite domain @xmath23 $ ] is mapped into the finite domain @xmath9 $ ] by the transformation @xmath24 .",
    "now the following algebraic nonlinear mapping is introduced @xmath25 where l and @xmath26 may be termed as the mapping parameters . at this stage introduction of the following relation ,",
    "@xmath27 coupled with the symmetrization procedure [ 31,32 ] leads to the transformed hamiltonian as below , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is given by the following relation , @xmath30 the advantage is that this leads to a _",
    "matrix eigenvalue problem which can be readily solved to give accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and at the same time . for the particular transformation",
    "used above , @xmath31 .",

    "the results are reported only up to the precision that were found to maintain stability with respect to these variations . in this way ,",
    "a consistent set of the numerical parameters ( @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) has been chosen which seemed to be appropriate and satisfactory for the current problem .",
    "first we present results for two simple test cases where accurate results are available for comparison .",

    "while for the ground and second excited states , the current results match the exact values completely , slight overestimation is noticed for the first and third excited states . it may be noted that the first three states reached the precision of table i with an @xmath43 of 50 a. u. and with 200 grid points . however , the fourth state required a grid of size 200 a. u. having 300 radial points , presumably due to its weakly bound nature and therefore having a long tail .",
    "the b - spline basis set calculations were done using a box of radius 250 a. u. and 263 b - splines .",
