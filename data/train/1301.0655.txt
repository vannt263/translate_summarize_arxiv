    "the difference in the si / fe ratios in the yields of sncc assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) and a top - heavy imf and different nucleosynthesis models by @xcite and @xcite are relatively small , within @xmath010% .    from the si / fe ratio of the perseus cluster , we also derived the number ratio of the sncc to sn ia to contribute metals in the icm .",
    "using the w7 and wdd1 models , the derived number ratios are 3.24.8 and 0.82.0 , respectively . the number ratio from the si / fe ratio strongly depends on the adopted nucleosynthesis model , as found by previous studies .",
    "the average s / si ratio of the icm in the perseus cluster is 1.02 @xmath2 0.14 in solar units .",
    "the s / fe ratio of the theoretical yield of sncc by @xcite with metallicity = 0.02 and the salpeter imf is 0.83 in solar units .",
    "the yields of the w7 model and the wdd models are approximately 1.11.2 in solar units .",
    "therefore , the observed s / si ratio of the perseus cluster is consistent with the yields of both sn ia and sncc .",
    "the integrated smlr using the @xmath3-band at 0.5@xmath14 of the perseus cluster is @xmath00.003 @xmath49 .",
    "when we assume that the si / fe ratio beyond 0.5@xmath14 is the same as that within the radius , the smlr out to 0.86@xmath14 becomes 0.0040.005 @xmath49 ( figure [ fig : imlr ] ) .",
    "the si abundance is not expected to increase with radius , because gas is more extended than stars .",
    "then , assuming the si abundance beyond 0.5@xmath5 is 0.4 solar , which is the si abundance at 0.10.5@xmath5 , the smlr becomes 0.005 @xmath49 .",
    "if the clumping of the gas is significant @xcite and the gas fraction at the virial radius is close to the value of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 7 @xcite , the cumulative smlr out to 0.86@xmath14 is overestimated by 2030% .",
    "to summarize , the expected value of the smlr at 0.86 @xmath14 , is 0.003 - 0.005 @xmath49 .",
    "adopting the w7 and wdd1 models for the sn ia nucleosynthesis model , the smlr synthesized by sncc becomes 0.0020.004 @xmath49 and 0.0010.002 @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the o , mg , and si abundances in the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) in early - type galaxies reflect stellar metallicity because the ism is thought to come from stellar mass loss .",
    "the abundances of these elements in the hot ism in bright early - type galaxies observed with suzaku are approximately 0.52 solar @xcite . extrapolating the observed gradient of the mg index in optical spectra of elliptical galaxies",
    ", @xcite calculated that the mean stellar metallicity , [ fe / h ] of individual galaxies ranges from -0.8 to + 0.3 and correlates with stellar luminosity .",
    "they also found that typical [ mg / fe ] is approximately + 0.2 .",
    "these results indicate that the si abundance in stars in giant cluster galaxies is approximately 0.52 solar . using @xmath3-band ,",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio in bright early - type galaxies are approximately unity @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the smlr trapped in stars should be 0.00050.002 @xmath49 .",
    "the estimated value of the total smlr in the perseus cluster ( i.e. , the sum of the smlr in the icm and in stars ) is 0.004 - 0.008 @xmath49 .",
    "theoretical models predict that the oxygen - mass - to - light ratio ( omlr ) and smlr of a cluster are very sensitive functions of the slope of the imf @xcite . here , the oxygen and silicon mass are a sum of that trapped in stars and that in the icm . adopting a salpeter imf with a slope of 2.35 , and difference in the stellar mass - to - light ratio between the b - band and @xmath3-band equal 5 , we find that the expected value of the smlr from sncc is @xmath50 .",
    "this value is close to the sum of the smlr in stars and icm from sncc , adopting the nucleosynthesis yield of wdd1 model . using the w7 yields ,",
    "the smlr from sncc corresponds to a slope of @xmath0 2 based on the calculation by @xcite . a top - heavy imf with a slope of 1.35 overproduces metals more than that with a factor of 20 .",
    "therefore , the expected value of the smlr out to the virial radius does not need the top - heavy imf .",
    "the solar si / fe abundance ratio in the icm of the perseus cluster indicates that most of the fe was synthesized by sn ia .",
    "the estimated rate of the current sn ia rate in present early - type galaxies are 0.10.3 sn ia/(100 yr)/(10@xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "we adopted the fe mass per sn ia rate by w7 model of 0.75 @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53@xmath54 for early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "then , accumulating the present sn ia rate over the hubble time , 13.7 gyr , the expected imlr from the sn ia becomes ( 26)@xmath55 .",
    "this value is over an order of magnitude smaller than the observed imlr ( 67 ) @xmath56 and ( 79)@xmath56 within 0.5 @xmath14 and @xmath00.86 @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the increase of the radial profile of the imlr with radius of clusters indicates that fe in the icm extends farther than stars , at least out to 0.5 @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discovered that the fe abundance profiles of the icm within @xmath6 are flatter than expected from the numerical simulations by @xcite , without agn feedback .",
    "these results indicate that a significant fraction of fe is synthesized in an early phase of cluster evolution , because if metal enrichment occurs after the formation of clusters , the metal distribution is expected to follow the stellar distribution . considering that most fe",
    "is synthesized by sn ia , the lifetimes of most of sn ia are much shorter than the hubble time , and the sn ia rate in cluster galaxies was much higher in the past .",
    "if the imf is close to that in our galaxy and if most of stars in our galaxy and clusters were already formed before a few gyrs ago , the abundance pattern ( including the icm and stars in cluster galaxies ) should naturally be similar to the solar abundance pattern .",
    "figure [ fig : imlrclusters ] compares the cumulative imlr profile of the perseus cluster with that of clusters of galaxies observed with suzaku or xmm out to 0.51.0@xmath24 including coma ( 8 kev ; matsushita et al .",

    "the imlr profiles of three cool - core clusters at a similar redshift , abell 262 , awm 7 , and the perseus cluster agree very well with each other at 0.20.5 @xmath24 , whereas the coma cluster has a lower imlr at 0.5 @xmath24 .",
    "there is no significant temperature dependence on the derived imlr profiles .",
    "since the imlr profiles increase with radius , comparison of the total imlr values requires observations of imlr profiles of clusters out to the virial radii .    at a given radius in units of @xmath24 , the hydra",
    "a cluster has a factor - of - two - higher imlr than the perseus cluster . because of the higher redshift of the hydra a cluster and lower icm temperature , the number of galaxies detected in hydra a might not be sufficient to deprojected the luminosity profiles in @xmath3-band .",
    "however , at @xmath58 , where systematic uncertainties due to the limited number of galaxies are relatively small , the cumulative imlr of the hydra a and the perseus clusters agree well .",
    "no systematic dependence on the icm temperature is evident for these two clusters with temperatures of 3 kev and 6 kev .    at the center , within 0.1 @xmath24 , the perseus cluster and the hydra a have",

    "the higher imlr in these two clusters reflect higher gas - mass - to - light ratio in 0.1 @xmath24 , since the fe abundance of these two clusters are not higher than those of the other clusters in this region @xcite .",

    "they discussed the initial enrichment by sncc in the early phase in cluster evolution and mixing of these metals .",
    "the o / fe and mg / fe ratios within the cool core of the perseus cluster are about unity in solar units @xcite and agrees with the o / fe ratio in the cool core of the hydra a cluster @xcite .",
    "the metals already synthesized in the protocluster phase can dominate those in the central regions of these two clusters .      the integrated gas mass to light ratio of the perseus cluster increases with radius out to 1800 kpc , or @xmath45 .",
    "at 1800 kpc , @xmath59 = 16 @xmath60 .",

    "in other words , if there is a significant clumping effect , the gas - mass - to - light ratio becomes flat beyond this radius out to @xmath16 .",
    "we analyzed xmm - newton data of the perseus cluster out to 0.5@xmath24 and derived the si / fe and s / fe ratios in the icm from the flux ratios of the ly @xmath1 lines of h - like si and s to the k@xmath1 line of he - like fe .",
