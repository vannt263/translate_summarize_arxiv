    "the spin symmetry energy of neutron matter , defined as the difference between the energy per particle of spin polarized and unpolarized neutron matter , is the main ingredient to understand the spin susceptibility of neutron matter , which is basically proportional to the invers of this quantity .",
    "microscopic calculations of the spin susceptibility , using realistic interactions and a variety of many - body methods show that the correlations induced by these realistic interactions considerable reduce the spin - susceptibility with respect to the underlying non - interacting fermi seas @xcite .",
    "this reduction implies an increase of the spin - symmetry energy of neutron matter .",
    "this prediction has also important consequences in the description of situations of astrophysical interest , such as for instance , the calculation of the mean free path of neutrinos in dense matter and , in general , the study of supernovae and protoneutron stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast with this scenario , it has been theoretically speculated that the spin symmetry of neutron matter can become zero , a fact that would indicate the existence of a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "notice , that looking at the kinetic energies of the corresponding underlying fermi seas , at a given density the kinetic energy of the polarized fermi sea will always be larger than the unpolarized one .",
    "therefore , the hypothetical ferromagnetic transition should be a consequence of the different role of the interactions in polarized and unpolarized neutron matter .",
    "in fact , many effective nuclear interactions of skyrme @xcite or gogny @xcite type predict this transition at densities accesible in neutron stars .",
    "however , in accordance with the reduction of the spin susceptibility comented above , microscopic calculations based on realistic interactions do not predict such transition at least in the wide range of densities which have been explored @xcite .",
    "the study of spin - polarization has also been recently considered for nuclear matter and finite nuclei using finite range effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a ferromagnetic transition has also been discussed in the context of hard - sphere systems in conexion with ultracold atom systems @xcite .",
    "all these facts have motivated the interest for the study of neutron matter and in particular of polarized neutron matter .",
    "it has also been pointed out that due to the large value of the @xmath0 scattering length , the behaviour of neutron matter , at densities where the physics is dominated by this partial wave , should show some similarities with the behaviour of a unitary fermi gas @xcite . at the same time , the absence due to the pauli principle of the @xmath2s@xmath3 channel in polarized neutron matter has driven the question of up to which density polarized neutron matter can behave as a weakly interacting fermi gas @xcite .    motivated by these questions , we have performed a microscopic calculation , in the framework of the brueckner  hartree ",
    "fock approximation , of the magnetic susceptibility of neutron matter employing the argonne v18 ( av18 ) realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite suplemented with the urbana ix three - body force @xcite , which for the use in the bhf approach is reduced to an effective two - body density - dependent interaction by averaging over the third nucleon @xcite . in order to identify the nature of the correlations responsible for the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility",
    "we have analyzed the contributions to the spin symmetry energy of neutron matter of the different partial waves and also of the different operatorial parts of the interaction .",
    "in addition , the degree of correlation of the two systems , polarized and unpolarized neutron matter , is discussed by comparing the differences of the kinetic energy of the correlated system with the ones of the underlying fermi sea .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii the brueckner ",
    " fock approach to spin polarized neutron matter and the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite are shortly reviewed .",
    "results for the magnetic susceptibility or , equivalently , for the spin symmetry energy and its density dependence are presented in sec .",
    "iii , where is also discussed the contribution of the different partial waves .",
    "finally , a short summary and the main conclusions are given in sec .",
    "spin - polarized neutron matter is an infinite nuclear system made of two different fermionic components : neutrons with spin up and neutrons with spin down , having densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the total density of the system is given by @xmath6 the degree of spin polarization of the system can be expressed by means of the spin polarization @xmath7 defined as @xmath8 note that the value @xmath9 corresponds to nonpolarized ( np ) or paramagnetic ( @xmath10 ) neutron matter , whereas @xmath11 means that the system is totally polarized ( tp ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ all the spins are aligned along the same direction .",
    "partially polarized states correspond to values of @xmath7 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the energy per particle of spin - polarized neutron matter does not change when a global flip of the spins is performed .",
    "therefore , it can be expanded on the spin polatization @xmath7 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy per particle of nonpolarized neutron matter , @xmath16 is defined as the spin symmetry energy , @xmath17 and @xmath18 it has been shown ( see _ e.g. , _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the energy per particle of spin - polarized neutron matter is practically parabolic in the full range of spin polarizations",
    ". therefore , contributions from @xmath19 and other higher order terms can be neglected , and one can , in good approximation , estimate the spin symmetry energy simply as the difference between the energy per particle of totally polarized , @xmath20 , and nonpolarized neutron matter _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath21",
    "a particularly interesting macroscopic property of spin polarized neutron matter related to @xmath16 is the magnetic susceptibility @xmath22 which , at each density , characterizes the response of the system to an external magnetic field and gives a measure of the energy required to produce a net spin alignment in the direction of it .",
    "if the strengh of the field is small @xmath22 can be obtained simply as ( see _ e.g. , _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnetic moment of the neutron and in the second equality we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssym ] ) .",
    "the bhf description of spin - polarized neutron matter starts with the construction of the neutron - neutron @xmath25-matrix , which describes in an effective way the interaction between two neutrons for each one of the spin combinations @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this is formally obtained by solving the well - known bethe - goldstone equation , written schematically as @xmath28 where @xmath29 indicates the spin projection of the two neutrons in the initial , intermediate and final states , @xmath30 is the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction , @xmath31 is the ( large ) volume enclosing the system , @xmath32 is the pauli operator taking into account the effect of the exclusion principle on the scattered neutrons , and @xmath33 is the so - called starting energy defined as the sum of the non - relativistic single - particles energies , @xmath34 , of the interacting neutrons .",

    "is simply the contribution of the free fermi gas ( ffg ) , and the second one is sometimes called in the literature _ correlation",
    "energy_. we note that @xmath41 represents only the sum of _ two - hole - line _ diagrams and includes only the effect of two - body correlations through the @xmath25-matrix .",
    "it has been shown by song _",
    "et al . , _ @xcite that the contribution to the energy from _ three - hole - line _ diagrams ( which account for the effect of three - body correlations ) is minimized when the so - called continuous prescription @xcite is adopted for the single - particle potential when solving the bethe  goldstone equation .",
    "this presumably enhances the convergence of the hole - line expansion of which the bhf approximation represents the lowest order .",
    "we adopt this prescription in our bhf calculations which are done using the argonne v18 ( av18 ) potential @xcite supplemented with the urbana ix three - nucleon force @xcite , which for the use in the bhf approach is reduced first to an effective two - nucleon density - dependent force by averaging over the coordinates of the third nucleon @xcite .",
    "the bhf approach does not give direct access to the separate contributions of the kinetic and potential energies because it does not provide the correlated many - body wave funtion @xmath42 .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the hellmann ",

    "[ fig : contri2 ] the density dependence of the kinetic @xmath47 and potential @xmath48 energy contributions to the energy per particle of both tp ( panel ( a ) ) and np ( panel ( b ) ) neutron matter as well as to the spin symmetry energy ( panel ( c ) ) and its slope parameter ( panel ( d ) ) defined as @xmath50 in analogy with the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy , @xmath51 .",
    "the particular values of these contributions at the empirical saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath52 @xmath53 , are reported in tab .",
    "the results have been obtained by applying the hellmann ",
    "feynman theorem as explained at the end of the previous section . as it can be seen in the figure ,",
    "the total energy of tp neutron is always more repulsive than the np one in all the density range explored .",
    "this additional repulsion of tp neutron matter can be understood , firstly , in terms of the kinetic energy contribution , which is larger in the tp case than in the np one .",
    "secondly , in terms of the potential energy one because , due to symmetry arguments , all partial waves with even orbital angular momentum @xmath54 ( some of them attractive , as the important @xmath0 ) are excluded in tp neutron matter ( see tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] ) .",
    "an interesting conclusion which can be inferred from here , already pointed out in previous works of the authors @xcite and other studies @xcite , is that a spontaneous phase transiton to a ferromagnetic state is not to be expected .",
    "if such a transition would exist , a crossing of energies of the tp and np systems , with the consequent change of the sign of the spin symmetry energy , would be observed at some density , indicating that the ground state of the system would be ferromagnetic from that density on .",
    "notice that there is no sign of such a crossing on the figure and that , on the contrary , it becomes less and less favorable as the density increases . as it is seen in the figure the kinetic enegy contribution to the spin symmetry energy , although it is always smaller than that of the potential energy one , is not negligible and , in particular , amounts @xmath55 of its total value at @xmath56 .",
    "this result is different from what is found in the case of the nuclear symmetry energy , @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy contribution to @xmath57 is very small ( and even negative ) due to the strong cancellation of the kinetic energies of neutron and symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the slope parameter @xmath58 is also clearly dominated in the whole density range by the potential energy contribution ( @xmath59 at @xmath56 ) except at very low densities where the kinetic energy one is of similar order .",
    "also interesting is the fact that in a significative density region around @xmath60 , @xmath61 is rather linear , indicating that the derivative of @xmath16 respect to the density is approximately constant ( see eq .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetic ] the density dependence of @xmath66 for tp and np neutron matter as well as for conventional symmetric nuclear matter ( sm ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath66 in the three cases indicates , as expected , that correlations become more and more important when the density of the system increases . note",
    "that in the whole range of densities explored , @xmath67 , reflecting the fact that sm is always more correlated than neutron matter independently of its spin polarization state , and that np neutron matter is always more correlated than tp one .",
    "however , the effect of correlations on the kinetic energy of tp neutron matter can not be discarded .",
    "note also that the difference @xmath68 is larger than the difference @xmath69 up to @xmath70 @xmath53 .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication that the spin dependence of the nucleon - nucleon correlations is less strong than its isospin one at least in the low and medium density region .    to get a more quantitative idea of the spin dependence of the nucleon - nucleon correlations in the following we",
    "analyze the role played by the different terms of the nuclear force , and in particular the spin dependent ones , in the determination of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . to such end , we apply the hellmann ",
