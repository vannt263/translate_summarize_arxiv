    "the natural and technological applications of self - assembled amphiphilic structures ( micelles ) in aqueous solution are vast @xcite . according to the common view , supported by numerous macroscopic experiments ( e.g. , conductivity and surface - tension measurements ) and widely accepted theories @xcite",
    ", amphiphilic molecules form aggregates above a well defined critical micelle concentration ( cmc ) . during the years , however , there have been several experimental indications @xcite , as well as theoretical ones @xcite , for the appearance of aggregates at concentrations well below the cmc  a phenomenon referred to as premicellar aggregation .",
    "in particular , a fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiment @xcite seems to have provided direct observation of premicellar aggregates at concentrations four times lower than the macroscopically determined cmc .",
    "recently we have presented a two - state ( monomer  aggregate ) thermodynamic model for amphiphilic aggregation which , alongside its simplicity , allows the study of metastable micelles of variable size @xcite .",
    "the analysis has yielded a sequence of three well separated concentrations : @xmath0 , where a metastable aggregated state appears but is not significantly occupied ; @xmath1 , above which an appreciable amount of metastable aggregates forms ; and @xmath2 , where the aggregated state becomes stable .",
    "the cmc as commonly measured in macroscopic experiments has been shown to correspond to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , appreciable premicellar aggregation may occur in the concentration range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that , so long as the micelles are not too large , the extent of premicellar aggregation is much larger than what would be expected from mere finite - size effects .",
    "this somewhat surprising effect stems from the variability of the `` excited state '' , i.e. , the freedom of the micelles to select their sizes , and the small free - energy difference between the pure monomeric state and the metastable one , which contains mostly monomers and a low concentration of aggregates .",
    "in addition , we have found that the premicellar regime is characterized by a weak concentration dependence of micelle size .",
    "thus , the premicellar aggregates have roughly the same size as those observed above the cmc , in agreement with the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is purely thermodynamic , does not fully account for possible kinetic barriers for premicellar aggregation .",
    "it has been assumed , and will be assumed below , that the solution has fully equilibrated .",
    "( in cases where high nucleation barriers exist , they might be overcome in practice , e.g. , through heterogeneous nucleation . )",
    "two key issues remain open , however .",
    "first , while the metastable premicellar state may be appreciably occupied at equilibrium , the aggregates might be short - lived .",
    "second , although the mean size of the premicellar aggregates is similar to that of the micelles above the cmc , the size distribution in the former case might be much broader .",
    "evidently , these issues of lifetime and polydispersity could jeopardize the experimental and technological relevance of premicellar aggregation .",
    "micellization dynamics ( above the cmc ) were thoroughly studied in previous works , both experimentally ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and theoretically ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "two disparate time scales are involved in the dynamics , corresponding to the exchange of individual monomers between the micelle and the solution and the much slower process of micelle formation and breakup .",
    "being interested in aggregate stability , we focus here on the latter .",
    "we use the free energy landscape , as obtained from the thermodynamic model @xcite , within kramers rate theory @xcite to study the lifetime of premicellar aggregates .",
    "the second extension of the theory is an examination of aggregate size fluctuations in the premicellar regime .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we briefly review the thermodynamic model of ref .",
    "@xcite and then extend it to study lifetime and polydispersity .",
    "representative numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] . in sec .  [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results and their implications for the observation of premicellar aggregates .",
    "our starting point is the two - state thermodynamic model of micellization presented in detail in ref .",
    "the solution , containing a volume fraction @xmath3 of amphiphiles , is assumed to consist of two species : monomers with volume fraction @xmath4 , and aggregates of @xmath5 molecules with volume fraction @xmath6 .",
    "the volume fraction of water is @xmath7 .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are treated as degrees of freedom , i.e. , the system can select the number of aggregates as well as their size , while the total volume fraction @xmath3 is the control parameter .",
    "the two - state approximation restricts the validity of the entire approach to compact ( spherical ) micelles , whose size distribution is relatively narrow @xcite .",
    "the free energy of the solution contains a mixing - entropy contribution and an interaction term .",
    "the former is calculated using a coarse - grained ( flory - huggins ) lattice scheme , where a water molecule occupies a single lattice site ( of volume @xmath8 ) , and each amphiphile occupies @xmath9 sites .",
    "the latter term , containing all other contributions to the free energy of transfer of a monomer from the solution to an aggregate of size @xmath5 , is represented by a single phenomenological function , @xmath10 . the resulting free - energy density ( per lattice site ) is @xmath11 + ( 1-\\phi)\\ln(1-\\phi ) . \\label{fs}\\ ] ] ( all energies in this paper are expressed in units of the thermal energy @xmath12 . )",
    "the specific form of @xmath10 is not crucial for the analysis ; it should merely have a maximum at a finite value of @xmath5 to ensure the formation of finite aggregates ( rather than a macroscopic phase ) upon increasing @xmath3 .",
    "for the sake of numerical examples we shall use the following function @xcite : @xmath13 ( the physical origins of the terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , as well as the rather limited range of relevant values for the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    equation ( [ fs ] ) defines a free - energy landscape over a two - dimensional space of macrostates @xmath17 . along the @xmath4 axis",
    "@xmath18 is always convex , i.e. , it has a single minimum at @xmath19 for all values of @xmath5 and for any @xmath3 @xcite . along the @xmath5 axis",
    "the free energy becomes nonconvex above a certain volume fraction , @xmath20 , with two minima at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and a maximum in - between , at @xmath23 . in the premicellar regime of interest ,",
    "@xmath24 , the free energy has a global minimum still at the pure monomeric state , @xmath25 $ ] , as well as a local minimum at the metastable aggregated state , @xmath26 $ ] ( containing mostly monomers and a a low concentration of aggregates ) .",
    "the two minima are separated by the saddle point @xmath27 $ ] , which poses a kinetic barrier for the disintegration of the metastable aggregated state into the stable monomeric one .",
    "the following analysis relies on two basic assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that overcoming the barrier at the saddle point @xmath27 $ ] is the rate - limiting process in aggregate dissociation , whereas diffusion is much faster . hence , the dynamics depend on @xmath5 alone , advancing at all times @xmath28 along the path @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the second assumption arises from the necessity to relate our coarse - grained model with single - aggregate properties . since the model [ e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) ] does not explicitly consider single aggregates but rather macrostates containing both monomers and aggregates , we shall consider , instead , a fictitious subsystem , of volume @xmath30 , which on average contains a single aggregate of size @xmath22 .",
    "the volume of the aggregate itself is @xmath31 , and the volume fraction of aggregates is @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the subsystem volume is @xmath33 since @xmath32 is very small , @xmath30 is far from being microscopic , and we may apply our coarse - grained description to the subsystem , writing its free energy as @xmath34 where @xmath18 is given by eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) .",
    "thus , the dissociation of a single premicellar aggregate is treated as the transition of a mesoscopic subsystem from a metastable state , containing monomers and ( on average ) one aggregate , to the stable , purely monomeric state . for brevity the free energy of the subsystem along the dissociation path @xmath29 $ ]",
    "is hereafter referred to as @xmath35 .",
    "we follow the lines of kramers theory @xcite while adapting it to the case of premicellar aggregates .",
    "the main assumptions of this approach are as follows .",
    "( i ) the energy barrier between the two states is sufficiently high , leading to separation of time scales between the fast monomer exchange process and the much slower aggregate dissociation .",
    "( ii ) the free energy of the final ( monomeric ) state is much lower than that of the initial ( aggregated ) one , ensuring a practically unidirectional probability current from the aggregated to the monomeric state .",
    "the first assumption breaks down when @xmath3 is too small , i.e. , as it gets too close to @xmath0 ; in the examples of sec .  [ results ] it becomes invalid already for @xmath36 .",
    "the second assumption fails when @xmath3 gets close to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the following calculation is strictly valid only for @xmath37 .",
    "( the behavior outside this domain of validity will be commented on separately in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] . ) in addition , we assume that the aggregation number is large , @xmath38 , so that the discrete changes in @xmath5 can be replaced to a good approximation by continuous , infinitesimal ones .",
    "we begin with the master equation for the probability density function , @xmath39 , of finding the subsystem around the state @xmath40 $ ] at time @xmath28 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the transition probability per unit time for the aggregation number to change from @xmath5 to @xmath43 . assuming that large jumps in aggregation number are improbable",

    "the roughly exponential increase of lifetime with concentration stems from the exponential dependence of @xmath82 on the barrier height [ eq .  ( [ taum ] ) ] , which is the main source of concentration dependence .",

    "the first , @xmath83 , comes from the aggregation - number diffusion coefficient , @xmath63 .",

    "[ fig_lifetime ] we see that in the case of amphiphile a , assuming @xmath89 ns , the aggregate lifetime reaches the order of @xmath90 s for @xmath91 , whereas the cmc is at @xmath92 .",

    "it has been shown in sec .",
    "[ results ] that considerations of aggregate lifetime can reduce the concentration range in which premicellar aggregates may be experimentally observable and technologically relevant , compared to the range determined from equilibrium considerations alone @xcite .",
    "in other words , the apparent concentration , above which an appreciable amount of metastable micelles appears , may be higher than @xmath1 .",
    "we have demonstrated , nonetheless , that kinetic stability ( i.e. , macroscopic lifetime ) still exists in most of the premicellar region . the more hydrophobic the surfactant , the wider the range of stability is .",
    "these conclusions are in line with results presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "although that study does not deal with premicellar aggregation , it has shown that the dissociation time of micelles remains very large even below the cmc .",
    "our kramers - like approach , as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ model ] , relies on two assumptions , which are violated near the edges of the premicellar region .",
    "the first assumption , of a high free - energy barrier between the metastable and stable states , is valid in almost the entire region except close to the lower edge , @xmath1 , where the barrier may become of order @xmath12 only .",
    "( see table  [ table2 ] . ) the resulting short lifetimes , though not accurately accounted for by the theory , are of little interest .",
    "the second assumption , of a large free - energy difference between the two states , holds in nearly the entire range as well , except very close to the upper edge , @xmath2 , where , by definition , the free - energy difference vanishes .",
    "the free - energy difference , in units of @xmath12 , becomes large quickly as @xmath3 gets smaller than @xmath2 , since the considered mesoscopic subsystem of volume @xmath30 contains a large number of molecules ( mostly monomers ) .",
    "in addition , correction of the theory near @xmath2 by considering a probability backflow from the monomeric to the aggregated state will only increase the stability of the latter .",
    "therefore , the deficiencies of the theory at the edges of the premicellar region do not affect our main results .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that the stability of premicellar aggregates imply also that high nucleation barriers may need to be overcome in order for them to form in the first place . correspondingly , the more hydrophobic the surfactant , the higher these barriers are .",
    "( the issue of high nucleation barriers for micelle formation above the cmc has been underlined also in ref.@xcite . ) hence , since both the preceding work @xcite and the current one have assumed full equilibration , their applicability within reasonable time scales might require in practice either reduction of nucleation barriers through heterogeneous nucleation or overcoming them by external means ( e.g. , agitation or sonication ) .    finally , we have found narrow size distributions of premicellar aggregates , i.e. , micelles below the cmc should be only slightly more polydisperse than their counterparts above the cmc .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig_size ] . )",
    "this agrees with the monodispersity observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , polydispersity does not pose a problem for the applicability of premicellar aggregation .                                                        for @xmath97",

    "one can find examples where @xmath98 approaches 2 , yet this occurs only close to @xmath2 , the upper edge of the metastable region , where the kramers - like approach becomes inappropriate .",
