    "the classical approach towards code design for channels is to maximize the data rate given a desired level of reliability .",
    "the classical outage formulation divides the set of channel realizations into an outage set @xmath0 and a non - outage set @xmath1 : it requires that a code has to be designed such that the transmitted message can be decoded with arbitrary small error probability on all the channels in the non - outage set .",
    "since the code must work for all such channels , the data rate is limited by the worst channel in the non - outage set .",
    "note that in this scenario , the communication strategy can not take advantage of the opportunity when the channel happens to be stronger than the worst channel in the non - outage set .",
    "for this classical approach , a seminal result in @xcite showed that there exists a fundamental trade - off between diversity ( error probability ) and multiplexing ( rate ) .",
    "this was characterized in the high snr regime for flat fading channels with multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas ( mimo ) @xcite .",
    "this d - m trade - off has been extended to several cases including scalar ( siso ) fading isi channels @xcite .",
    "the presence of isi gives significant improvement of the diversity order .",
    "in fact , for the siso case the improvement was equivalent to having multiple receive antennas equal to the number of isi taps @xcite .",
    "diversity embedded coding takes advantage of the good channel realizations by an opportunistic coding strategy @xcite .",
    "although the focus is on two levels of diversity , the results can be easily generalized to arbitrary number of levels .",
    "consider two information streams with @xmath2 denoting the message set from the first information stream and @xmath3 denoting that from the second information stream .",
    "diversity embedded codes encode the streams such that the high - priority stream ( @xmath2 ) is decoded with arbitrary small error probability whenever the channel is not in outage ( @xmath0 ) and in addition the lower - priority stream is decoded whenever the channel is in a set @xmath4 of good channels ( see figure [ fig : divemb ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore the performance of diversity embedded codes @xcite over isi channels with single degree of freedom _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 . the rates for the higher and lower priority message sets , as a function of @xmath6 , are respectively @xmath7 and @xmath8 . consider transmission over a channel for which @xmath9 is the optimal single - layer diversity - multiplexing point corresponding to the channel .",
    "after transmission the decoder jointly decodes the two message sets and we can define two error probabilities , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which denote the average error probabilities for message sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "we want to characterize the tuple @xmath12 of rates and diversities channel that are achievable where , @xmath13 if viewed as a single - layer code , the diversity embedded code achieves rate - diversity pairs @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where it is assumed that @xmath16 . since it is not possible to beat the single - layer d - m trade - off , note that necessarily @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that when we have one degree of freedom ( one transmit many receive or one receive many transmit antennas ) the d - m trade - off was successively refinable .",
    "that is , the high priority scheme ( with higher diversity order ) can attain the optimal diversity - multiplexing ( d - m ) performance as if the low priority stream was absent .",
    "this property of successive refinement is illustrated in figure [ fig : sucref ] .",
    "however , the low priority scheme ( with lower diversity order ) attains the same d - m performance as that of the aggregate rate of the two streams . when there is more than one degree of freedom ( for example , parallel fading channels ) such a successive refinement property does not hold @xcite .",
    "since the fourier basis is the eigenbasis for linear time invariant channels we can decompose the transmission into a set of parallel channels . since it is known that the d - m trade - off for parallel fading channels is not successively refinable @xcite , it is tempting to expect the same for fading isi channels .",
    "the main result in this paper demonstrates that for fading isi channels with one degree of freedom ( siso / simo / miso ) the d - m trade - off is indeed successively refinable . at first",
    "this result might seem surprising , but the correlations of the fading across the parallel channels cause the difference in the behavior .    for the siso isi case",
    "we show that uncoded transmission is sufficient to demonstrate successive refinability . for the miso case",
    "we need to develop a coding strategy related to universal codes @xcite to obtain our main result .",
    "surprisingly like the flat fading case , the isi fading channel with single degree of freedom ( siso / simo / miso ) is successively refinable .",
    "the main result of this paper is stated below .",
    "[ thm : mainres ] the diversity multiplexing trade - off for a @xmath19 tap point to point miso / simo / siso isi channel is successively refinable , _",
    "i.e. _ , for any multiplexing gains @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 the achievable diversity orders given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 are bounded as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is finite and does not grow with snr .",
    "note that theorem [ thm : mainres ] holds for arbitrary number of levels of diversity , _ i.e. _ , the diversity multiplexing trade - off is _",
    "infinitely divisible_. an implication of theorem [ thm : mainres ] is that for miso / simo / siso fading isi channels , one can design `` ideal '' opportunistic codes which adjust to the rate supported by the fading channel without apriori knowing about the the channel .",
    "this property could be used for allowing new networking functionalities through opportunistic scheduling @xcite as well as wireless multimedia delivery . in summary , we believe that this property and the code construction used to achieve this result could be important for future broadband wireless system design .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : problem ] we formulate the problem statement and present the notation . a crucial structural observation on the behavior of isi fading channels",
    "is established in [ chap5:sec : strobs ] .",
    "using these observations we show the successive refinability of siso and simo isi channels using uncoded qam codes in section [ chap5:sec : simtra ] . in section",

    "we conclude with a short discussion in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "some of the more detailed proofs are provided in the appendices .",
    "our focus is on the quasi - static fading isi channel where we transmit information coded over @xmath27 transmit antennas with @xmath28 antennas at the receiver . throughout this paper , we assume that the transmitter has no channel state information ( csi ) , whereas the receiver is able to perfectly track the channel ( a common assumption , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the coding scheme is limited to one quasi - static transmission block of large enough block size @xmath29 to be specified later .",

    "this definition implies that one can perfectly embed a high diversity code within a high rate code _",
    "i.e. _ , the high - priority can attain the optimal diversity performance as though the low - priority stream were not there and yet the diversity performance of the low priority stream is the same as the optimal diversity of a stream with the aggregate rate of the two streams .",
    "from an information - theoretic point of view @xcite focused on the case when there is one degree of freedom , ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath68 ) , and transmission over a flat fading rayleigh channel . in that case",
    "if we consider @xmath69 without loss of generality , it was established @xcite that the channel is successively refinable .",
    "this implies that for channels with a single degree of freedom @xmath68 , we can design ideal _ opportunistic _ codes and that the d - m trade - off for simo / miso are successively refinable .",
    "the question of successive refinability was further investigated in @xcite for @xmath70 parallel i.i.d channels , the simplest of the channels with multiple degrees of freedom , and it was shown that the channel is not successively refinable .",
    "in particular , if we desire the optimal performance for the higher layer stream ( @xmath20 ) then there is a loss of diversity of @xmath71 due to the embedding and therefore the @xmath70 parallel i.i.d .",

    "we will show in this paper that the isi channel is successively refinable by utilizing the fact that correlations exist across these sets of independent parallel channels .",
