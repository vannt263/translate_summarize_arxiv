    "[ sec : rvder ] and to derive the properties for the primary star as described in ",
    "[ sec : spder ] .",
    "the main apogee pipeline retains rvs from two methods : 1 ) the apogee reduction pipeline initially selects , through @xmath26 minimization , an rv template from a coarse grid of synthetic spectra ( the `` rv mini - grid '' ) .",
    "this template is cross - correlated against the spectrum to produce absolute rvs .",
    "2 ) the pipeline cross - correlates the visit spectra with a combined spectrum of all visits and applies a barycentric correction to acquire heliocentric rvs .",
    "these rvs are stored as apogee data products .    to ensure the highest precision rvs , we preformed the additional step of using the best - fit synthetic spectrum chosen by aspcap as the rv template .",
    "the grid of synthetic spectra used by aspcap is much finer than the rv mini - grid with additional dimensions to account for [ @xmath27/m ] , [ c / m ] , and [ n / m ] . in addition",
    ", the final model spectrum is achieved through cubic bzier interpolation in the grid of spectra .",
    "therefore , the aspcap best - fit template is a significant improvement over the rv mini - grid template and provides a high - quality match to the observed combined spectrum .",
    "this approach combines the advantages of using a noiseless synthetic spectrum as a template and using the combined observed spectrum to mitigate the chances of template mismatch . in the cases when mismatch did occur ( e.g. , due to a poor or failed aspcap solution )",
    ", we deferred to the rvs derived from the combined observed spectrum template . in either case , the rvs we used for orbit fitting were heliocentric rvs .",
    "to fully understand the types of companions to which we are sensitive , we need a clear understanding of dependencies of the rv precision on stellar parameters .",
    "therefore , we created an empirical model of the rv precision based on the primary derived stellar parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , [ fe / h ] ) and the @xmath17 for each visit of the star : @xmath28 - ( 5.55\\times 10^{-3 } ) s / n , \\end{split } \\label{eqn : rvprec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the signal - to - noise ratio of the visit spectrum from which the rv measurement was derived , and @xmath29 is the rv measurement error in m s@xmath2 .",
    "this model was determined by fitting a linear function of each parameter of interest using all apogee stars with at least 8 visits , excluding stars used as telluric standards and stars that have unreliable stellar parameters .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : rverrdist ] displays two of the stronger effects on rv error : [ fe / h ] and @xmath17 per visit .",
    "the effects of @xmath24 and @xmath23 are illustrated in the right panel .",
    "these effects are closely related to the strength and number of absorption lines in the spectra . for a typical solar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath30 ) giant ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and typical solar metallicity dwarf ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) stars with @xmath35",
    ", we derive a typical rv precision of @xmath20130 m s@xmath2 and @xmath20230 m s@xmath2 , respectively per visit .",
    "these are the random rv uncertainties reported by the apogee pipeline , and are likely to be underestimates of the true uncertainty ( see appendix [ sec : caveats ] ) .",
    "rv measurements from observations with @xmath36 , as well visits that produced failure conditions in the rv pipeline , were not included in the final rv curves submitted to the orbit fitter .",
    "this reduced the number of stars for which keplerian orbits could be attempted from 14,840 to 9454 stars .",
    "likely rv variable stars were selected using the following statistic : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the rv measurements and their uncertainties , and @xmath40 is the median rv measurement for the star .",
    "the criterion was motivated by the false positive analysis presented in appendix [ sec : simres ] .",
    "there are also several additional pieces of information that we used to pre - reject stars that would have resulted in poor or erroneous keplerian orbit fits .",
    "therefore we also removed stars with the following criteria :    * the system s primary must be characterized with reliable stellar parameters ( @xmath41 , [ fe / h ] ) , so the aspcap @xmath42 flag must not be set for the star .",
    "derivations of the rvs and the physical parameters of the system both rely on reasonable estimates of the stellar parameters of the host star . *",
    "the star can not have been used as a telluric standard .",
    "these stars are selected for apogee observation for their nearly featureless spectra , so it is likely that rvs derived for these stars are unreliable and would lead to false positive signals . * the combined spectrum from which the stellar parameters and rvs were derived can not be contaminated with spurious signals due to poor combination of the visit spectra , so the ` suspect_rv_combination ` flag must not be set for the star .",
    "this criterion also catches the double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) that would have resulted in poor stellar parameters , rvs , or orbital parameters from our current pipelines .",
    "this preselection reduced the number of stars for which keplerian orbit fits were attempted from 9454 to 907 .",
    "this is not to say the stars excluded do not have any sort of rv variation , but the false positive interpretation can not be ruled out for these stars , so we elected not to include them .      to determine masses of potential companions , a reasonable estimate of the primary star s mass",
    "is required .",
    "the measurement of masses for the primary stars in this sample is based on the spectroscopic stellar parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , [ fe / h ] ) derived for each star . between @xmath43 and aspcap , stellar parameters are derived up to three times for each source .",
    "the first approach uses the stellar parameters from the rv template selected for determining initial visit - level rvs .",
    "these parameters are available for every star , but are also the least precise of the three methods , so they should only be used as a last resort .",
    "the next set of stellar parameters made available are from the raw aspcap output .",
    "except in the rare cases where aspcap fails to converge ( which are removed from the final sample ) , these are available for all stars .",
    "finally , calibrations are applied to the raw aspcap results based on comparisons with manual analysis of cluster stars @xcite .",
    "these parameters are only available for giant stars in a specific temperature range ( @xmath44 k ) , but are the most reliable in absolute terms .",
    "to summarize , in order of preference , we adopted : ( 1 ) stellar parameters from the calibrated aspcap parameters , ( 2 ) uncalibrated aspcap parameters , ( 3 ) parameters used by the much coarser rv mini - grid .",
    "all of the dwarfs in this catalog rely on uncalibrated parameters .",

    "the trend subtracted is the average of the raw velocities : @xmath154 .",
    "measured velocities below the minimum or above the maximum are assigned @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "the purpose of this metric is to prevent the pipeline from selecting an extremely eccentric orbit when the data do not support such a model .",
    "values of @xmath145 and @xmath155 are given in the example rv curves of figure [ fig : exrvcurves ] .",
    "combining the above statistic with the traditional reduced @xmath26 goodness - of - fit statistic ( @xmath156 ) , we define the modified @xmath26 statistic , @xmath157 by which the models are ranked . in the case that @xmath158 or @xmath159 , @xmath115 would be recorded as a floating - point infinity and automatically be ranked below all other fits .",

    "information on catalog content and access can be found in appendix [ sec : data ] .      in many cases , the rv variations are within the measurement errors , so the derived semi - amplitude for the orbit may be masked by measurement error . in these cases ,",
    "we can not reliably state that the rv variations are astrophysical in nature .",
    "however , even astrophysical rv variations may not be due to the presence of a companion .",
    "many stars , especially giant stars , which compose a large part of this sample , can have high levels of intrinsic rv variability . to estimate this stellar rv jitter , we adopted the relation found by @xcite : @xmath166 where , again , @xmath24 is the logarithm of the surface gravity in cgs units .",
    "we define a total rv uncertainty for each point in the model fit by combining this quantity with the rv measurement uncertainties , @xmath29 : @xmath167    we use the following criteria to select statistically significant companion candidates : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the median rv uncertainty of the model fit , @xmath170 is the rv semi - amplitude of the best - fit model for the star , and @xmath155 is the velocity uniformity index described in  [ sec : fitcrit ] .",
    "we include the @xmath171 term to increase the significance criteria for eccentric systems , particularly those that have poor velocity coverage .",

    "698 stars are selected as statistically significant companion candidates .      in an effort to minimize the number of false positives in this sample and reduce the number of systems with incorrectly - derived orbital parameters ( see appendix [ sec : verification ] ) , we eliminate candidates that do not satisfy the following criteria :    * none of `` marginal fit '' criteria described in  [ sec : fitcrit ] are met . * the keplerian fits must be reasonably good , which we quantify as the criteria : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the median absolute residuals of model fit . from simulations and visual inspection of orbits , orbits with large median @xmath175 or @xmath176 reproduced the correct parameters and had reasonable fits at much larger values of @xmath115 than orbits with lower values . a major exception to this trend",

    "[ sec : keporbits ] .",
    "systems that reach that maximum limit of iterations in the fitter did not converge on a solution , and the orbital parameters output are likely to be unreliable .",
    "as mentioned above , many of these criteria were inspired by the testing of simulated systems with known orbital parameters described in appendix [ sec : verification ] . using these refined criteria , 382 stars ( 55% of the statistically significant rv variable sample )",
    "were selected to be a part of the `` gold sample , '' which represent the best - quality companion candidates detected by apogee .",

    ", there appears to be two distinct companion mass regimes in which the candidates lie , and thus suggests different companion formation channels .",
    "the upper regime is the binary star track , where the companion likely formed with ( or shortly after ) the primary from fragmentation of the cloud or disk from which the primary formed .",
    "the lower regime is the `` planet '' track , where the companion likely formed after the primary either through core accretion or gravitation instability in the disk surrounding the protostar .",
    "the trend of the lower planetary boundary mimics the sensitivity of the apogee survey ( see equation [ eq : senslimit ] with @xmath189 m s@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the trend of the planet track s upper boundary can not be explained by a selection or sensitivity effect .",
    "one interpretation of the gap between the two regimes is a manifestation of the bd desert in the data , but the two tracks appear to merge at larger semimajor axes ( @xmath190 au ) . the implications of this are discussed below .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : orbdist ] indicates that this sample reproduces the bd desert , but only for orbits with @xmath191 ( @xmath192 days ) , which is significantly less than the 3 au extent of the desert as in @xcite .",
    "however , it has been previously suggested that the bd desert observed for solar - like stars may cease to exist for f dwarf stars @xcite",
    ". their proposed explanation of this effect is that g dwarfs are more efficient at tidal dissipation . in general , compared to jupiter - mass planets , more massive small separation companions undergo stronger tidal interaction with their host star through angular momentum exchange .",
    "stellar - mass companions , however , have sufficient orbital angular momentum to remain in a stable orbit , which explains the demise of small separation bd - mass but not stellar - mass companions .",
    "however , f ( and earlier ) dwarfs are known to remain rapid rotators ( @xmath193 km s@xmath2 ) throughout their main - sequence lifetimes due to their smaller outer convective zones leading to weaker magnetic breaking .",
    "this means f dwarfs are also less efficient at extracting angular momentum from an orbiting companion .",
    "therefore , rapid rotators such as f dwarfs inhibit tidal dissipation , which explains this `` f dwarf oasis '' for bd companions .",
    "the dynamical model presented in figure 4 of @xcite shows that a companion in the bd - mass regime on an initial 3-day orbit around a @xmath194 star will survive for @xmath195 of the star s main sequence lifetime ( @xmath196 gyr ) , while the same companion around a host star with @xmath197 will survive for at least the entirety of the host star s main sequence lifetime ( @xmath198 gyr for a @xmath199 star ) .",
    "the presence of a large number bd companions orbiting the evolved stars in this sample strongly supports this `` f dwarf oasis '' hypothesis .",
    "overall , this catalog s large number of systems with short - period bd companion candidates challenges the notion of the bd desert as we know it , and certainly warrants further investigation .          in figure",
    "[ fig : orbdist ] , we also see the distribution of orbital eccentricities . as expected , the smallest - separation ( @xmath200 au ) stellar - mass companions all have circular orbits .",
    "the circularization cutoff period increases with the age of the system with 5 - 10 gyr systems having cutoff periods of 12 - 20 days @xcite .",
    "all of the binary companions in this catalog with @xmath201 au have @xmath202 days .",
    "therefore , the distribution of eccentricities for the binary systems in this sample , with circular orbits at small separation , and eccentric orbits at large separations is not unexpected . the closest ( @xmath203 au ) planetary - mass companions appear to have also circularized , as expected , but a surprising result is the relatively large fraction of eccentric orbits for relatively close - in planetary - mass candidate companions . for the rg and rc hosts , one interpretation of these eccentricities is ongoing tidally - induced migration ( see  [ sec : evolhosts ] for further discussion of this ) .",
    "however , the majority of the small - separation planetary and bd candidate companions orbit dwarf and sg stars . for these systems , their higher eccentricities may be further evidence for the mechanism suggested by @xcite whereby stellar illumination heating a gap cleared by a forming planet may excite the eccentricity of the planet in the gap .",
    "solar type stars ( i.e. , g dwarfs ) have been the primary focus of exoplanet and stellar multiplicity studies .",
    "out of the 382 stars in this sample , only 36 are solar - type ( ms with @xmath204 ) stars .",
    "figure [ fig : hostdist ] reveals that , in addition to the solar - type stars , this sample contains cool dwarfs , subgiant and giant stars , which allows us to probe many different stellar types and stages of stellar evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : hostdist ] also presents distributions of the stellar parameters of the host stars in this sample .          tidal dissipation is thought to play an important role in the destruction of planetary systems as a star evolves off the main sequence and expands @xcite .",
    "this sample contains 225 @xmath205 au candidate companions to evolved stars , indicating either many initial small separation companions survive engulfment or farther - orbiting planets undergo increasing tidal migration as its host ascends the giant branch , bringing the companion closer to its host star .",
    "the nine candidate planetary - mass ( @xmath206 ) companions orbiting giant stars in this sample would be a @xmath207 increase in the number of currently known giant stars hosting a planet ( @xmath208 according to the tabulation by * ? ? ?",
    "as @xcite mentions , there is a small separation cut - off for rg hosts .",
    "the current record - holder for smallest separation of an rv - detected planet rg host is hip 67851b with @xmath209 au @xcite .",
    "the shortest period planet orbiting a giant star , kepler 91b , is on a 6-day orbit @xcite .",
    "most of the candidate planets orbiting giants lie between these two systems , with a few candidates closer than kepler 91b .    of the evolved stars in this sample ,",
    "23 are verified red clump ( rc ) stars @xcite .",
    "rc stars are metal - rich stars which have passed through the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) and have contracted due to the ignition of core helium burning .",
    "it is expected that stars like the sun may reach radii up to 1 au when they reach the tip of the rgb .",
    "therefore , the presence of companion candidates orbiting rc stars at @xmath210 in this catalog ( see figure [ fig : orbdistgiants ] ) is a surprising discovery . to investigate this",
    "further we compared the rc stars to rgs in this sample , but we consider only rgs with [ fe / h ] @xmath211 ( [ fe / h ] of the most metal - poor rc in this sample ) and @xmath212 ( the @xmath24 range of the rc stars ) to eliminate possible effects from rv sensitivity issues .",
    "this also allows us to compare stars approximately half way up the giant branch to stars that have already passed through the tip of the rgb , and have achieved their largest extent .",
    "these 92 rg stars have 62 stellar - mass , 25 bd - mass , and 5 planet - mass companion candidates compared to 18 , 5 and 0 for the 23 rc giants",
    ".    a cursory look at these numbers ( and figure [ fig : orbdistgiants ] ) shows a lack of smaller companions for red clump stars , as well as a companion candidates found at smaller separations for the 92 rg stars when compared to rc stars ( 0.07 au vs. 0.2 au at the low - mass end ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that no companion candidates have circular orbits among rc hosts ( smallest @xmath213 ) .",
    "this all points to the role of the tidal migration and destruction of companions , particularly planetary - mass companions .",
    "however , any tidally induced migration of companions will be much weaker than when the star was in the rgb phase . therefore any companions with @xmath214 au around an rc star likely would have to have survived inside the star s envelope during its rgb phase .",
    "most of the rc hosts with @xmath214 au candidate companions are likely post - common envelope systems , and thus may have experienced drag - induced migration to bring them to their current orbit .",
    "these systems certainly warrant deeper investigation .          according to the compilation of exoplanets.org @xcite , of the confirmed planet - hosting stars with metallicity measurements , only 15 have [ fe / h ] @xmath4 .",
    "this sample has 41 stars with [ fe / h]@xmath215 , and of these , two host candidate planetary - mass companions and 14 host candidate bd companions . the most metal - poor stars in this sample approach [ fe / h ] @xmath216 .",
    "while there are no candidate planets among the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath217 ) hosts ( 5 stars ) , there are two companions in the bd mass regime .",
    "the smaller fraction of the lowest - mass companions detected among the most metal - poor stars in this sample is not surprising as the rv uncertainties are higher for metal - poor stars , as described in equation [ eqn : rvprec ] .",
    "also , it is not too surprising to find metal - poor stars hosting binary companions , given the @xcite result .",
    "however , finding a population of metal - poor stars potentially hosting bd companions is surprising in the context of the core accretion model of companion formation , and may suggest an alternate formation mechanism for these companions .",
    "most surveys for stellar and substellar companions have focused on stars in the solar neighborhood , especially with the recent interest in m dwarf planet hosts .",
    "in contrast , only three of the sources in this catalog are within @xmath218 pc of the sun , where the vast majority of known planets with distance measurements have been found . in a galactic context",
    ", this sample is truly complementary to previous studies .",
    "the current most - distant known planet host is the microlensing source ogle-2005-blg-390l at 6.59 kpc @xcite .",
    "the most - distant planetary - mass ( @xmath219 ) candidate companion in this catalog orbits the slightly metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath220 ) , rg ( @xmath221 ) star 2m05445028 + 2847562 , which lies at a comparable distance of 6.13 kpc .",
    "furthmore , this sample has 36 companion candidates farther than this distance .",
    "of these , 12 are bd - mass companions around stars reaching to a distance of 15.7 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : galdist ] demonstrates the galactic reach of this catalog s companion candidate hosts . a large majority of this sample ( 327 stars )",

    "it is safe to say that companions of all types are ubiquitous across the thin disk .",
    "as we move from the thin disk to the halo , the proportion of higher - mass companions increases .",
    "this trend is likely due to the combination of the sensitivity bias that low - mass companions are less likely to be detected around more metal - poor stars ( see equation [ eqn : rvprec ] ) , and the planet - metallicity correlation .",

    "we simulated 9000 planetary systems with random characteristics .",
    "the masses of the primary stars were drawn from the distribution of estimated masses for the actual candidate substellar hosts in the apogee data .",
    "the companion masses and periods were drawn from the distributions specified by @xcite , using a mass range of 1 - 100 @xmath234 and periods from 0.1 to 2000 days .",
    "eccentricities were drawn from a uniform distribution with a maximum of @xmath235 , which corresponds to the eccentricity of hd 80606 b , the largest eccentricity in the exoplanets.org database .",
    "companions with @xmath236 days were assumed to have circular orbits .",
    "the radii of the apogee candidate host stars were also estimated , and planets with orbital separations less than 5 @xmath237 were considered unphysical because the tidal decay of planetary orbits becomes relevant at such small separations .",
    "the longitude of periastron and the orbital phase of periastron passage relative to a reference date were drawn from uniform distributions .    with the orbital characteristics of the simulated companions defined",
    ", we simply used the @xmath238 code in the idl astronomy user s library to calculate the measured heliocentric rv for each system on a set of observation dates .",
    "the observation dates for each system were designed to mimic the way the survey proceeded .",
    "the observations for each star were spread randomly over a 3.2 year time period assuming the telescope was on - sky for 15 days followed by 14 days off sky since apogee observed primarily during bright time .",
    "the simulated ` measured ' rvs consisted of the actual motion of the star at the time of observation plus two sources of noise , drawn from gaussian distributions .",
    "the first is simply measurement noise , which nominally has @xmath239",
    "m s@xmath2 but is increased to @xmath240 m s@xmath2 for @xmath241 of the visits to simulate poor observing conditions .",
    "the second noise source is intrinsic stellar atmospheric rv jitter , with an amplitude drawn from the distribution in @xcite .",
    "a second data set of 9000 simulated system were generated with much of the same parameters as the first , except that it had mass ratios approaching one , all orbital parameters were drawn from a uniform distribution , and it was much sparser in the lower - mass companion regime .",
    "we combined these two data sets to obtain complete coverage of parameter space . from the combined data",
    "set , we generated rv curves with 9 , 12 , 16 , and 24 visits selected from the 24-visit parent sample with the 100 m s@xmath2 rv uncertainty level , as well as a set where the base uncertainty level is inflated to 1 km s@xmath2 to emulate rv measurements from the metal - poor host stars in this sample .",
    "the full test suite of simulated systems was run through the @xmath51 pipeline each time an update to the fitting algorithms was implemented .",
    "many of these updates were inspired by the simulated systems for which the pipeline failed to reproduce the correct orbit in the previous run .",
    "in addition , many of the criteria used to select the rv variable and gold candidate sample , described in  [ sec : catalog ] , were inspired by these results .",
    "notable failures in previous runs that led to new selection criteria for candidate companions included :    * * long - period systems : * the longest - period simulated systems demonstrated the largest scatter in their results .",
    "this inspired the use of the phase uniformity index ( see  [ sec : fitcrit ] ) , as well as a procedure to reject any solutions for which the period was longer than twice the baseline (  [ sec : selgold ] ) .",
    "* * highly eccentric systems : * the code had the most difficulty reproducing the orbital parameters of systems with high eccentricity ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "however , these systems are extremely rare , so this is not a major issue .",
    "nevertheless , this result still led to the decision to reject all orbital solutions with @xmath162 (  [ sec : fitcrit ] ) , which is the planetary system with the largest known eccentricity anyway . even with this cut , however , the more eccentric the system , the more trouble the code had in recovering the correct orbital parameters . in particular , systems with low numbers of visits had the most issues .",
    "this result inspired the use of the velocity uniformity index in the fitting code (  [ sec : fitcrit ] ) , and it led to the decision to implement more stringent significance cuts for eccentric systems (  [ sec : selrvvar ] ) .",
    "* * one - day aliased systems : * early tests of the code on simulated systems revealed a tendency for solutions to cluster around integer fractions of one day , despite the initial period selection avoidance of such periods .",
    "this inspired the decision to reject any periods within @xmath243 of 1/3 , 1/2,1 , 2 , or 3 days (  [ sec : fitcrit ] ) .",
    "these simulations were also used to understand how rv noise from the star or measurement error can potentially lead to a false positive candidate companion . to accomplish this we ran the simulated systems through the ` aporbit ` pipeline following the procedures laid out in  [ sec : orbfit ] using just the rv signals from the star s atmospheric jitter and random measurement errors .",
    "we ran the simulations using four different numbers of visits ( 9 , 12 , 16 , and 24 ) and two uncertainty levels ( 0.1 and 1 km s@xmath2 ) , and selected candidates using the criteria described in  [ sec : catalog ] .",
    "the results of the false positive tests are summarized in figure [ fig : falsepos ] .",
    "for systems with 24 visits , out of 18,000 simulated systems only two systems at the 1 km s@xmath2 uncertainty level registered as false positives .",
    "the raw number of false positives increased dramatically from 24 to 16 visits , and the higher uncertainties lead to a higher rate of false positives .",
    "most false positives clustered around the sensitivity limit corresponding to the rv measurements from which they were derived ( see equation [ eq : senslimit ] below ) , and are generally assigned eccentric orbits ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "this information , along with visual inspection of these fits , led to a pre - cut based on the velocity variations of the star which was based on the value of the statistic described in  [ sec : selrvs ] for these systems .      in the results presented here , we ran the 18,000 simulated systems through the @xmath51 pipeline as described in ",
    "[ sec : keporbits ] for the four visit levels ( @xmath245 ) and two uncertainty levels ( @xmath246 km s@xmath2 ) , and selected companion candidates in the same manner as the gold sample , as described in ",
    "[ sec : selrvs ] , [ sec : fitcrit ] , and [ sec : catalog ] .",
    "the systems correctly recovered ( @xmath160 and @xmath170 recovered within 10@xmath247 , and @xmath178 recovered within 0.1 ) are shown in figure [ fig : compsim ] .",
    "systems with large @xmath170 but small errors can lead to larger values of @xmath26 for a fit that still produces the correct orbital parameters .",
    "unfortunately , removing the @xmath111 constraint allows many systems with incorrect solutions to pass , so we err on the side of caution and keep it in place . due to limits of the period search and the other constraints on the period , @xmath137 , and @xmath111 of the fit described in ",
    "[ sec : selgold ] , we expect to be able to recover orbits for companions having @xmath248 , depending on the baseline , number of visits , and the rv uncertainty level ( see figure [ fig : compsim ] ) . by fitting a trendline to the simulated systems with @xmath249 for various values of @xmath29",
    ", we also find that the lower limit on detectability , which we will refer to as the sensitivity function(sf ) , of @xmath229 can be written as : @xmath250 where the constant offset , @xmath251 , depends on the sensitivity level ( which we interpret as the median rv uncertainty , @xmath252 ) : @xmath253        we then compared each observed / recovered orbital parameter , @xmath254 , with the actual parameters for the system , @xmath255 , to determine how accurately the parameters are recovered as a function of parameter space .",
    "these results are summarized in figure [ fig : compsim_erranal ] . for a large portion of the parameter space ,",
    "the selected candidates reproduce the correct orbital parameters quite well . the systems that give the most trouble",
    "appear to be the low - mass companions , companions at large separations , and companions with highly eccentric orbits .",
    "unsurprisingly , parameter recovery is overall worse for stars with fewer visits and higher rv uncertainties , but the drop in performance was not as dramatic between the 24 visit and 16 visit simulations as it was between the 16 visit to 9 visit simulations .",
    "however , from these results we can still conclude that in almost all regimes , the recovered orbital parameters are at least characteristic of the true values for the system .",
    "+         finally , we construct the recovery rates across the parameter space covered by this catalog .",
    "these are summarized in figure [ fig : recplots ] .",
    "unsurprisingly , recovery rate drops as @xmath256 decreases , and higher rv uncertainties lead to lower recovery rates in general .",
    "+          in addition to comparing to the known parameters of simulated rv signals , we also compared our results to the transit periods of 5 kepler object of interest ( koi ) hosts and one non - koi eclipsing binary ( eb ) observed by apogee @xcite that also meet the gold sample selection criteria described in  [ sec : catalog ] .",
    "this comparison is presented in table [ tab : koicomp ] .",
    "we use the radius of the koi as determined by _ kepler _ transit data to split the sample .",
    "we assume a koi with @xmath257 will have @xmath258 , and therefore any koi with a radius less than this will likely be undetectable by apogee .    for three of the five apogee - detectable kois and ebs in the gold sample",
    ", the transit period is reproduced almost exactly , and for the remaining two , it appears that the @xmath51 code simply selected the wrong harmonic for the period .",
    "for example , with koi-1739 , if we assume that the 146.0 day period found by apogee is the first harmonic of a fundamental period of 73 days , then the first harmonic period would be 219 days , which is much closer to the transit period .",
    "most of the apogee - detectable kois have been designated as `` false positives '' by the _ kepler _",
    "team , meaning that the companion detected is not a planet , but rather a binary star companion .",
    "koi-1739 is still designated as a candidate , but from apogee s rv data , we can conclude that this koi should have a `` false positive '' disposition , as its companion is almost certainly not of planetary mass according to the analysis presented here .",
    "for the apogee - undetectable koi , the apogee results from koi-2598 may be indicative of longer - period companion previously undetected by transit .",
    "further investigation of these this system is certainly warranted .",
