    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a unique experimental setup for studying properties of solid state systems in a very clean and well controlled fashion @xcite . particularly interesting in this context",
    "is the experimental implementation of artificial gauge fields for neutral atoms @xcite@xcite , simulating for instance time - reversal symmetry breaking magnetic fields @xcite@xcite or a coupling of the atom s internal spin degree to its angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the realization of these effects will open a path for precise simulations of a large class of topologically non - trivial systems such as quantum hall ( qh ) or quantum spin hall ( qsh ) phases .",
    "creating topological states of matter with cold atoms is particularly attractive because of the precise control of physical parameters such as the hopping amplitude and interaction strength , allowing the possibility to observe strongly interacting topological phases in lattice experiments .",
    "however the implementation of artificial gauge fields for neutral atoms is only one experimental challenge in simulating topological phases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "experiments must overcome the difficulties provided by the finite size of the lattice and the soft boundary of the system , caused by a trapping potential that is smoothly varying in space .",
    "finite size leads to a finite overlap of spatially separated counterpropagating edge states and therefore to possible backscattering processes , decreasing the robustness of the edge states against external perturbations @xcite .",
    "while this is not a very serious restriction for optical lattice potentials , which are relatively pure , the effects of the soft boundary of the optical lattice system may significantly change the properties of the edge states characterizing topological insulators in finite systems . whereas recent publications identify the soft boundaries as an unwanted restriction or propose how to avoid them by implementing artificial sharp boundaries to their system @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate in this article that soft boundaries will lead to interesting additional features , either not present or at least not visible in systems with sharp boundaries . for this purpose ,",
    "we investigate different trap shapes and geometries , which are realizable in optical lattices and discuss their specific influence on the cold atom system .",
    "this article is organized in the following way .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec2 ] , we present the theoretical model under consideration , a qh hamiltonian in the tight - binding approximation for spin polarized fermions confined in an additional trapping potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we present our results for the stripe geometry , discussing in detail the properties of the edge states in systems with a hard wall boundary , a harmonic trap and a quartic trapping potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we study the shape of the edge states in a completely trapped system and investigate the suitability of several detection methods as tools to probe the system experimentally , including bragg spectroscopy . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we provide some conclusions .",
    "the model we consider is similar to the ones proposed in @xcite , experimentally realizing time - reversal symmetry breaking topological insulators with ultracold atomic gases .",
    "this model describes a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of spin - polarized fermionic atoms subjected to a square optical lattice , experiencing an artificial abelian gauge field @xmath0 that induces an artificial uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice , @xmath1 , which is similar to the celebrated hofstadter hamiltonian @xcite on the lattice . in our system , the gauge field @xmath0 enters the first - quantized hamiltonian of the system in form of the minimal coupling @xmath2 , which leads to the hamiltonian : @xmath3 hamiltonian contains the optical lattice potential @xmath4 and a spatially dependent scalar potential @xmath5 which allows for the inhomogeneity of the lattice , caused by the finite width of the laser beams creating the lattice or additional external potentials such as a harmonic trap or an artificial hard wall boundary . for the moment",
    "we leave the detailed shape of @xmath5 arbitrary , and only assume that the non - local matrix elements of @xmath5 are negligible ( i.e. @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wannier state at lattice site @xmath8 ) , which is reasonable in our case since the potential is either varying slowly compared to the lattice spacing @xmath9 , or is a step function",
    ".    the second quantized form of hamiltonian in the tight binding approximation then reads @xmath10 the operator @xmath11 here denotes the fermionic creation operator at lattice site @xmath8 , with its respective annihilation operator @xmath12 .",
    "the first term is the well known nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping with amplitude @xmath13 , and is complex due to the peierls phases @xmath14 that are a result of the gauge field @xcite .",
    "the second term corresponds to the inhomogeneity @xmath5 with the local matrix elements @xmath15 .",
    "the phases @xmath16 are not uniquely defined by the magnetic field and depend on the gauge chosen . in this paper , we choose the common landau gauge @xmath17 , which leads to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the coordinates of lattice site @xmath8 with lattice spacing @xmath21 and @xmath22 represents the flux per plaquette in units of the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath23 . setting @xmath24 , we obtain @xmath25 for the square lattice . throughout the rest of this article",
    "we choose the hopping @xmath13 as the natural energy unit of our system .    in the following sections we will restrict our analysis to the case where @xmath26 or @xmath27 respectively .",
    "our results for these two cases can easily be generalized to other cases where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , and where topological edge states are predicted @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of a similar model was proposed in @xcite , where the authors consider a spinful fermionic system subjected to an artificial gauge field that simulates a magnetic field of the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the spin quantum number .",
    "this model preserves time - reversal invariance and therefore allows for the realization of qsh phases in optical lattices .",
    "because of the time - reversal symmetry , our analysis also applies to this model when spin remains a good quantum number , and we will mention the corresponding qsh phases throughout the text .",
    "so far , we have not accounted for a zeeman splitting due to an external magnetic field , a spin - orbit coupling or a staggering potential , all realizable in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the physics caused by these additional effects are indeed very interesting and leaving them out may seem quite restrictive , but the results we discuss in this article are quite general and require only that the states are topological and do not rely on the detailed nature of the edge states .",
    "the defining property of topological insulators in a semi - infinite system is the emergence of gapless edge states which are localized at one edge and robust against perturbations of the system , e.g. potential or magnetic disorder .",
    "furthermore , the presence of these states is the origin of the currents measured in qh @xcite and qsh samples @xcite which are well known to be strictly quantized when @xmath32 is a good quantum number .",
    "topological phases are typically distinguished by the transport properties of the edge states , specifically by the quantized charge ( or mass for neutral atoms ) that is transported at a single edge @xcite .",
    "one method of determining the topological quantum number for a given system is therefore to calculate the energy spectrum on a cylindrical geometry and to evaluate the transport properties of the edge states directly .",
    "alternatively , one may determine the topological quantum numbers from the dispersion relation of filled bands @xcite or the corresponding eigenstates @xcite in the corresponding infinite system .    in this section we will focus on a cylindrical geometry and",
    "determine the spectral functions of the system of interest via exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian for a finite system of size @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we discuss the properties of the edge states of the system by analyzing the integrated spectral function in quasi - momentum space and real space for several kinds of boundaries and show the robustness of the edge states against perturbations by switching on a disordered potential .",
    "topological phases can be characterized either by analyzing the band structure properties of the infinite system , or in terms of the transport properties of the system in a confined geometry .",
    "while the first approach is insensitive to the specific shape of the confining potential , the latter may in principle strongly depend on these details . in this section",
    "we discuss the properties of edge states at an infinite wall boundary , realized by open boundary conditions at the edges of the cylinder , henceforth referred to as stripe geometry . for this kind of boundary",
    "the topological quantum number of the infinite system is equivalent to the transport coefficient @xmath34 of the finite system , a relation known as the bulk - boundary correspondence @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 counts the difference in number of forwards - moving and backwards - moving states at the fermi edge , which represents the net transport for low - energy excitations and hence the quantized edge current @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "explicitly we have @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 labels the states at the fermi edge with energy @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the left and right edge , respectively .",
    ". can be obtained by applying the well - known laughlin argument to a cylindrical geometry and subsequently following the procedure described in @xcite , where no details of the trapping potential are required . for the gauge @xmath40",
    ", the single particle hamiltonian obeys the symmetry @xmath41 , which leads to @xmath42 . throughout this article",
    "we will only consider the hall transport coefficient for the left edge @xmath43 , which is identical to the topological @xmath44 quantum number of the infinite system and determines the hall conductance @xmath45 .",
    "the topological @xmath46 quantum number @xmath47 , which indicates qsh phases in the corresponding spin-1/2 system @xcite can then be obtained , if @xmath32 is a good quantum number , by @xcite @xmath48 if @xmath49 the system will exhibit a qsh phase .    in this paper",
    "we make an explicit distinction between an `` edge state '' and an `` edge mode ''",
    ". an edge state always refer to an eigenstate of the hamiltonian that is localized to one edge , whereas an edge mode refers to a series of edge states that are smoothly connected in momentum - space .",
    "although this distinction is not necessary for hard - wall systems , it is required for soft boundary systems .",
    "we first consider a system described by with a step potential @xmath5 that is zero for @xmath50 and infinite elsewhere , with @xmath51 sufficiently large , providing a hard - wall boundary at the edges of the cylinder .    since the quasi - momentum in the @xmath52-direction is a well - defined quantum number and we are interested in transport coefficients for this direction , it is convenient to represent the spectrum of the system in terms of the integrated spectral density @xmath53 , where the spectral function is defined as @xmath54     for a system described by with flux @xmath27 and hard - wall ( left ) and quartic ( right ) confinement .",
    "edge states are shown in red ( gray ) , while bulk states are shown in black . ]",
    "we integrate only over the left half of the system in real space , so as to separate the left from the right edge states @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_hqh]a ) , upper , the integrated spectral density @xmath55 is shown for @xmath26 .",
    "one can identify the bulk states which are grouped into six thick bands and the edges states , which close the gaps between the bands . to determine the transport coefficients and possible topological phases , we place the fermi edge in a bulk gap and apply to the dispersion of the edge states .",
    "there are several phases visible in this system .",
    "if the fermi edge lies within a bulk band , the system is in a trivial metallic phase .",
    "if the fermi edge lies between the third and fourth band , there are a set of dirac points with a linear dispersion and the phase is a semi - metal . in the bulk gaps , which lie between the other bands ,",
    "the edge modes place the system in a quantum hall phase with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the first and second bulk gap , respectively , and inverted for the third , fourth bulk gap . in shorthand , we can specify the phases between the bands by @xmath58 , where d represents dirac points . in the analogous spin-1/2 system , @xmath59 indicates a qsh phase whereas @xmath60 corresponds to a normal insulator , due to lack of topological protection .",
    "in addition we also investigate the case where @xmath27 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : a25_inv ] for which we find @xmath61 .",
    "note that there are no dirac points for @xmath27 .",
    "the differences between gap@xmath62 and gap@xmath63 appear as different real space behaviors within soft confining potentials that are not visible within a hard - wall confinement , as we demonstrate in the next section .",
    "with soft boundaries , it becomes relevant to look at the spectra of the system in real space along the @xmath64 axis , @xmath65 , as well as the partially integrated spectra in quasi - momentum space along the @xmath66 axis , @xmath55 .",
    "the quasi - momentum spectra allows us to extract transport coefficients and discuss the dispersion of the edge modes . on the other hand",
    ", the real space spectrum exhibits some unusual features for different trapping conditions .",
    "we consider a lattice of size @xmath33 and trapping geometries of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is chosen such that @xmath70 which is larger than the energy spanned by the infinite system @xmath71 .",
    "three particular values of @xmath72 are relevant to experiment : @xmath73 which reproduces hard - wall boundary conditions , @xmath74 for quartic confinement and @xmath75 for harmonic confinement . in most optical lattice experiments ,",
    "the confining potential is a result of the gaussian envelope of the finite beam width of the lasers and in the center of the trap we may approximate this confinement by its leading order harmonic term .",
    "however , it is has been suggested @xcite that one can remove the harmonic term by superimposing an anti - trapping gaussian beam of different detuning to the trapping beam , which then promotes the quartic term to the leading order approximation of the trapping potential , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "this scheme was realized in optical lattice experiments to improve quantum phase diffusion experiments @xcite .",
    "we investigate these trapping geometries below in further detail .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_hqh ] , we show a comparison between @xmath55 and @xmath77 for @xmath26 and hard wall , quartic and harmonic confinements that are relevant to experiment .",
    "one can see that the potential does not gap the system , and edge modes continue to connect the bands .",
    "the transport coefficients of the soft boundary systems , indicated to the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_hqh ] , are insensitive to the trapping potential . in other words , there exist energy ranges in which we can identify a transport coefficient , which is identical for all confinements we consider .    comparing the @xmath66-dependent soft - boundary spectra of the upper row in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_hqh ] , we make two observations : 1 ) we can readily identify highly degenerate regions of bulk bands in the hard - wall and quartic confinements , and 2 ) we find that the dispersion of edge modes that are present within quartic confinement do not change noticeably when changing the confinement to the harmonic trap . in contrast , the rest of the spectrum is significantly modified , such that the ratio of bulk to edge states is very small . to define such a bulk region in the soft boundary system",
    ", we assume the edge begins at a distance from the trap center where none of the states at this point overlap in energy with any of the states in the very center of the trap ( i.e. at @xmath78 ) .",
    "analogously , we can clearly identify a bulk region from the @xmath64-dependent spectra in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_hqh ] for the quartic trap , but not in the case of the harmonic trap . from this",
    "we conclude that the quartic trap is likely the best trapping potential for observing effects of both the bulk system and topological edge states in an experimental setup , if it is not feasible to artificially implement hard wall boundaries as proposed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observe no overlap between states of different edges , which has been proposed to destroy edge states via couplings between the edges @xcite .",
    "this again shows that the edge states are topologically protected and robust against external changes in the potential .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : a25_inv ] , we also show a comparison of @xmath55 for the case where @xmath79 between a hard wall ( left column ) and a quartic confined system ( right column ) .",
    "we again calculate the transport coefficients of both systems and list these next to the plots to show that these also coincide for all trapping potentials .",
    "to better understand the details of the rather complicated spectra of the quartic trap , we choose to follow the edge modes of the hard - wall confinement by smoothly varying the trapping exponent @xmath72 .",
    "we show plots for @xmath80 and @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_modes ] , where we have artificially colored the spectra to indicate each edge mode .",
    "@xmath81 represents a very steep trap , and is almost identical to the hard - wall case : with the color designation , one sees that the blue ( marked as @xmath82 ) and yellow @xmath83 edge states are only present in the 2nd and 3rd bulk gaps , respectively , whereas the red @xmath84 and green edge states ( @xmath85 ) span two bulk gaps .",
    "as the confinement is made softer , we see that an edge mode may cross the bz more than once , and that the energy range of the edge states changes , e.g. with @xmath86 the red state ( @xmath9 ) now extends into the 3rd bulk gap . however , whenever this occurs , the state forms an avoided crossing at some higher energy with a different edge state and is forced downwards in energy , a process which preserves the value of the topological invariants . we represent this in the false color diagram by a dotted line for parts of the edge states that are non - topological , i.e. not connecting different bulk bands . for @xmath87",
    ", we can consistently see this occurring in the most energetic edge mode ( colored green , ( @xmath85 ) ) , which extends above the highest bulk band , and forms an avoided crossing with the non - topological edge state created by the effect of the trapping on the highest bulk band .",
    "note that , due to the trapping potential , several edge states that belong to the same edge mode may exist for one value of energy .      when the number of edge modes changes , as the fermi edge crosses a bulk band in the hard - wall boundary system , either an edge mode must be created , or an edge mode must merge into either the bulk band itself or with another edge mode . in the soft - boundary system",
    "we can see some very non - trivial behavior that shows the complexity of these processes .",
    "we first focus on the real space spectra of the @xmath27 flux system under quartic confinement , see fig .",
    "[ fig : aboth_real ] . in the lowest gap",
    ", we see that two different edge modes , which evolve between the first and second bulk band , merge into a single edge mode , which evolves between the second and third bulk band . in the hard wall system , this mode is localized to a single site in the @xmath64-direction and can only be observed in quasi - momentum space . in the quartic trap ,",
    "the edge states leaving the first bulk band follow the shape of the quartic potential and one may expect the same for the states leaving the second bulk band .",
    "as one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig : aboth_real ] , this is not the case .",
    "the states leaving the second bulk band immediately start to merge with the edge states from the first bulk band and the result is only a single mode at each edge , evolving between the second and third bulk band .",
    "although it is not possible to determine topological invariants from real - space spectra , we can link this merging behavior to the @xmath66-space spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : a25_inv ] and see that it leads to the correct topological quantum number @xmath56 .",
    "the same effect is again observable between the fourth and fifth bulk band .",
    "interestingly , the merging of these modes does not take place via a simple overlap of the states , but a gap in real space with negligible spectral weight exists between the states originating from the bands and the newly - formed edge mode .    in the @xmath26 flux system ,",
    "we also see the opposite effect : the splitting of a single bulk band , to connect edge modes of different bands which are energetically well separated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_hqh ] , the integrated spectral density @xmath77 shows that the modes leaving the second and fifth bulk bands each split into two curves , where a single eigenstate has large amplitudes on two spatially separated lattice sites .",
    "we interpret this splitting as a process that facilitates the connection between different bands which we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_modes ] . for example",
    ", the outer part of the mode leaving the second bulk band can be seen to merge at higher energies with the mode that is a product of the third and fourth bands .",
    "this connection between the bands is analogous to the avoided crossings that we observe in the @xmath66-dependent spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_modes ] .",
    "this very non - trivial behavior of modes within the outer region of the system , combined with transport coefficients which are identical to the topological quantum numbers , given by the transport coefficients of the infinite system , indicates that the soft edge states are of topological origin . to further verify this , we address in section [ sec : robustness ] the robustness of these states against perturbations in terms of a disordered background potential .",
    "when we look more closely at the dispersion of the edge modes , we can see an interesting connection to the bulk bands of the system .",
    "we focus on the quasi - momentum spectra for the case @xmath88 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a16_modes ] for increasing confinement exponent @xmath72 .",
    "the dispersion of an edge mode leaving a given bulk band can be described on two different quasi - momentum scales . for a small range of @xmath66 ,",
    "the dispersion mimics that of its associated bulk band , and this behavior becomes more prominent for smaller @xmath72 .",
    "this can be seen for the lowest edge modes , colored red ( @xmath9 ) and blue ( @xmath89 ) , e.g. the red ( @xmath9 ) mode has a locally flat dispersion , mirroring the flatness of the lowest band . however , when avoided crossings have occurred , such as for the yellow ( @xmath90 ) and green ( @xmath85 ) edge modes , the dispersion of an edge mode can not simply be described by one band alone and corresponds to a mixture of bands .    on the other hand ,",
    "considering the brillouin zone as a whole , the edge modes become more flat in momentum space , the smoother the confining potential is in real space .",
    "this flattening is a direct result of the number of accessible sites at the edge .",
    "the number of lattice sites , @xmath91 , that are available for an edge state between e.g. the first and the second bulk band , is the number of sites @xmath92 that fulfill @xmath93 , where @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) are the maximum ( minimum ) energies of the first and second bulk band , respectively , and @xmath96 is the minimum energy of the first bulk band @xcite . in the hard wall system , @xmath97 but becomes larger the smoother the confining potential becomes in real space .",
    "an interesting result for the @xmath88 flux per plaquette , is that the flatter the potential becomes , the flatter the lowest gap edge modes become , with a corresponding increase of the effective mass of system s excitations : @xmath98 this is generally true for soft confinements , as pointed out in @xcite , but the edge state structure in the case @xmath26 allows this feature even for relatively steep potentials .     for a system described by eq .",

    "the inner part of these states merges with the edge states of the third band at higher energies .",
    "similar behavior is observed for the @xmath99rd , @xmath100th and @xmath101th band .",
    "as pointed out in the text , this non - trivial behavior is an indication of the topological origin of the edge states . ]",
    "one of the most important properties of topological edge states is their robustness against even large perturbations , which leads to clearly detectable quantized hall conductance in impure experimental setups . in optical lattice experiments which are , by construction , very clean realizations of condensed matter hamiltonians , perturbations such as disorder are usually not an issue",
    "however , since disordered potentials can be implemented in a controlled manner @xcite , it is of interest to thoroughly investigate how robust the edge states are against these kinds of perturbation . here",
    ", we address this question for soft boundaries . the general argument , which illustrates the robustness of edge states in condensed matter systems , is the lack of possible backscattering processes @xcite .",
    "counter - propagating edge states are localized on opposite edges of the system and are very well separated spatially . therefore , in huge condensed matter systems , these states have vanishing spatial overlap and backscattering from impurities is completely suppressed .",
