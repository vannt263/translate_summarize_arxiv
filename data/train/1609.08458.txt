    "the isoperimetric inequality is a very well known geometric problem .",
    "the problem is to find a simple closed curve that encloses the maximum area than any other simple closed curve having the same length . from the ancient time",
    "it is known that the solution is the circle .",
    "there is a famous story about this problem .",
    "the story is dating back the problem to vergil s epic latin poem the _ _",
    "aeneid__@xcite , written in the period 29 bc to 19 bc .",
    "this poem is about the foundation of the city of carthage .",
    "the greeks @xcite , were the first who considered this problem and tried to solved it .",
    "+ many mathematicians from ancient time tried to solve this problem .",
    "it was believed that zenodours @xcite in second century first gave a complete proof .",
    "later steiner , euler , weierstrass and many mathematicians proved it using different techniques .",
    "for complete history and some proofs see blasj @xcite , osserman @xcite .",
    "+ demar@xcite in 1975 proved the isoperimetric inequality in the plane using some geometric arguments .",
    "he proved that if a closed continuous curve solves the isoperimetric inequality in the plane then any triangle formed by the intersection of two tangents at any two points and the chord joining them is isosceles . and",
    "he then showed that for every point on that curve at which a tangent can be drawn lies at a same distance from a fixed point inside the curve . in this article",
    "we only use the first idea of demar@xcite that all such triangles are isosceles and then we shall prove that only for the region having maximum area all such triangles with equal base are congruent .",
    "our main target is to prove the following theorem .",
    "it is well known that the solution is a convex region in the plane @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so only the convex regions will be focused here .",
    "we will also assume that the solution of the above inequality exists .",
    "for the existence of such problem , see book of russel benson @xcite . before proving the above theorem we will describe some notions .",
    "+    let @xmath0 be a simple closed curve bounding a convex region @xmath4 .",
    "now standing at any point @xmath2 on the curve @xmath0 and facing the region @xmath4 , there is a right - hand and left - hand direction along @xmath0 from @xmath2 .",
    "a right - hand tangent at @xmath2 is a ray from @xmath2 tangent to @xmath0 in the right - hand direction and similarly left - hand tangent can be defined @xcite .",
    "now the interior angle between these two tangents , i.e , the angle between right hand and left hand tangent at any point , measured in the sector containing @xmath4 , is at most @xmath5 for a convex region @xcite .",
    "+          consider two points @xmath2 and @xmath6 on @xmath0 such that tangents at @xmath2 and @xmath6 meets each other at @xmath7 .",
    "if the length @xmath8 is @xmath9 then we call the triangle @xmath10 , the tangent triangle on the curve @xmath11 of base length @xmath9 and denoted it by @xmath12 see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is not always possible that for any base length we get a tangent triangle , e.g , there is no tangent triangle of a circle with base length same as diameter .",
    "but for sufficiently small length it is possible to construct a tangent triangle at any two points on the curve by taking this length as base of the triangle .",
    "now for general convex curve two tangent triangles with equal base length may not be congruent but in a circle all the tangent triangles with equal base are congruent .",
    "we prove this by contradiction .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simple closed curve of length @xmath1 , enclosing a convex region @xmath4 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath4 is not circular and has the property that it has maximum area than any other region with same boundary length @xmath1 .",
    "since the set of points where the convex curve is not differentiable is at most countable [ @xcite , page 154 ] hence there is a dense set of points of @xmath0 where tangents can be drawn .",
    "demar @xcite proved that any tangent triangle of @xmath4 is isosceles , see figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we will show that all the tangent triangles having same base length are congruent .",
    "+ without loss of generality we can take two tangent triangles @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are not congruent . since their base are equal hence @xmath15 . assume that @xmath16 .",
    "now the triangle @xmath17 is isosceles .",
    "so we get @xmath18 now reflect the whole area @xmath19 with respect to the perpendicular bisector of @xmath20 .",
    "then we get a new curve @xmath21 by replacing @xmath22 by its image @xmath23 under the reflection .",
    "hence we get a new region @xmath24 , see figure [ fig3 ] and since reflection does not change area and perimeter hence both @xmath4 and @xmath24 have same area and perimeter . now the image of the triangles @xmath10 , @xmath25 and @xmath17 under the reflection are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "but @xmath32 and @xmath33 are right hand and left hand tangents of @xmath21 , therefore @xmath24 is not convex .",
    "it is a contradiction that @xmath4 is the region of maximum area among all regions with the same perimeter .",
    "hence all the tangent triangles having equal base are congruent and since all the tangent triangles are isosceles , so @xmath0 must be a circle .",
