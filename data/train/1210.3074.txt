    "the in - medium modification of vector - meson properties has been a topic of interest for quite some time now .",
    "their vacuum properties are well - known nowadays , but the question of how their masses and widths change when embedded in a hadronic medium ( either cold nuclear matter or the hot fireball of a heavy - ion collision ) is debated heavily . for recent reviews on in - medium effects ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the popular predictions on the one hand include standard many - body effects , like a collisional broadening of the meson spectral function due to collisions with the hadronic medium .",
    "on top of that , a second class of predictions claims that the vector - meson masses are shifted in the medium due to the ( partial ) restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "qcd sum rules can constrain these effects , but do not provide definitive predictions @xcite .    when studying in - medium effects of the @xmath0 meson by observing its decay products one has to remember that the invariant mass reconstructed from the four - vectors of the decay products always contains a product of spectral function and branching ratio . in choosing the decay channel",
    "one has the choice between the rare dilepton decay mode , which is free of final - state interactions , and the more prominent hadronic or semi - hadronic decays , like @xmath1 . while the latter has the advantage of a much larger branching ratio of 8.3% ( roughly three orders of magnitude above the dilepton channel ) , it suffers from the fact that of one the decay products ( namely the @xmath2 ) undergoes strong final - state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "for a long time it was commonly assumed that there are ways to cope with this issue , but we will show here that the pion fsi poses a major obstacle and in fact makes the @xmath3 decay unsuitable for certain in - medium studies .    experimentally , the decay @xmath1 has been studied intensively by the cbelsa / taps collaboration in photoproduction reactions on nuclei @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 mesons in cold nuclear matter have been investigated via the dilepton decay channel by e325 at kek @xcite , clas at jlab @xcite and hades at gsi @xcite . while e325 claimed an omega mass shift without any broadening ,",
    "the clas data indicate a broadening of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 , but no shift . for the hades data ,",
    "no consistent interpretation is available yet regarding the @xmath0 meson : so far the p+nb data only seem to show indications for an absorption of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "overall , the in - medium mass shift of the @xmath0 meson is still an open issue from an experimental point of view .",
    "we will start this paper with a short description of features of the gibuu model , which are relevant for the present study of @xmath0 photoproduction reactions on nuclei .",
    "this will be followed by an overview over several methods for determining the in - medium properties of @xmath0 mesons in cold nuclear matter . as a new method",
    "we propose a study of the @xmath0 meson s momentum distribution .",
    "our tool for the numerical simulation of @xmath0 production and decay is the gibuu hadronic transport model , which provides a unified framework for various types of elementary reactions on nuclei as well as heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this model takes care of the transport - theoretical description of the hadronic degrees of freedom in nuclear reactions , including the propagation , elastic and inelastic collisions and decays of particles .    in gibuu the spectral one - particle phase - space distributions , @xmath5 , of all particles",
    "are obtained by solving the coupled kadanoff - baym equations @xcite for each particle species in their gradient - expanded form @xcite    @xmath6    with    @xmath7    here @xmath8 denotes a poisson bracket , and the so - called backflow term ( second term on the lhs of ( [ eq : os - transp.9 ] ) ) is usually neglected .",
    "further , @xmath9 is the phase - space density related to @xmath10 by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the spectral function of the particle is normalized as @xmath13 . ] and @xmath14 is the spin - degeneracy factor . the quantity @xmath15 in the backflow term is the width of the spectral function , and @xmath16 denotes the retarded green s function .",
    "our model explicitly includes off - shell transport of particles with density - dependent spectral functions .",
    "in particular , equ .",
    "( [ eq : os - transp.9 ] ) is compatible with the off - shell equations of motion obtained in @xcite , which leads to the correct asymptotic spectral functions of particles when they leave the nucleus .",
    "the expression @xmath17 on the rhs of ( [ eq : os - transp.9 ] ) denotes the collision term that couples all particle species ; it contains both a gain and a loss term . for a short derivation of this transport equation and further details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . in order to solve the buu equation numerically , we rely on the test - particle ansatz . here",
    "the phase - space densities are approximated by a large number of test particles , each represented by a @xmath18-distribution in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons is treated as described in appendix c.8 of @xcite , i.e. with parameterized matrix elements for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which have been fitted to experimental data .",
    "the absorption and rescattering of @xmath0 mesons in nuclear matter proceeds via the channels @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( where r is a nucleon resonance ) .",
    "it is described in appendix b.3 of @xcite , just like @xmath25 scattering , which reproduces the available data reasonably well .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce an extra modification factor @xmath26 for the inelastic @xmath27 scattering :    @xmath28 for @xmath29 , the additional contributions to the cross sections are put into the channel @xmath23 .",
    "[ fig : xs ] shows the total @xmath27 cross section for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as well as the contributions from different channels ( for @xmath30 only ) .",
    "collision cross section for k=1 and k=2.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we have chosen to put the additional absorption strength connected to the @xmath26 factor into the @xmath32 channel , since the @xmath25 channel is constrained by the inverse reaction @xmath33 via detailed balance .",
    "this strength could also be due to higher multiplicity channels like @xmath34 , or could even mimic many - body absorption processes such as @xmath35 .",
    "our simulation procedure uses the full photon - energy range of 1.2 to 2.2@xmath36with the appropriate @xmath37 weighting factor of the bremsstrahlung spectrum .",
    "any in - medium changes , such as that of the mass and the width , are assumed to be linearly proportional to the nuclear density .",
    "as far as in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 spectral function are concerned , we treat two different cases :    \\1 .",
    "an in - medium mass shift according to    @xmath38    with a scaling parameter parameter , @xmath39 , as suggested in @xcite , corresponding to a 16% mass shift at @xmath40 . here , @xmath41 is the vacuum mass of the @xmath0 meson and @xmath42 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "an increase of width due to collisions in the medium .",
    "the collision rate is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the relative velocity of the @xmath0 with respect to the hadronic medium and @xmath45 is given by the cross section depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] . in order to maintain consistency between this collision rate and the collisional width appearing in the spectral function of the @xmath0 we use in the latter the momentum averaged expression @xmath46 the value of @xmath47",
    "is chosen to match the gibuu collision term with @xmath31 , and is compatible with the cbelsa - taps transparency - ratio data @xcite .",
    "we will show our results for these two cases separately and also for a combination of both .",
    "we assume a linear density dependence for both mass and width , since photoproduction experiments are anyway limited to small densities @xmath48 , and pion fsi further reduces the sensitivity to large densities , as we will show in the following .",
    "therefore , nonlinearities which can appear at higher densities can be neglected .",
    "the idea to study in - medium properties of the @xmath0 meson via the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum was first proposed in an early exploratory study by messchendorp et al .",
    "@xcite , and further studied theoretically in a subsequent transport investigation @xcite .",
    "the first measurement followed soon @xcite and indeed claimed to observe a shifted in - medium peak in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this claim was withdrawn later , after follow - up analyses @xcite with systematic studies of the background could not confirm the finding .",
    "the results of our present transport study indicate that about 30 % of all @xmath1 decays occur in the medium ( i.e.  at densities above a threshold of @xmath49 ) . however , there are several effects which affect the actual observability of any in - medium effect .",
    "first of all , one expects a significant melting of the in - medium peak due to collisional broadening . from the transparency ratio measurement of kotulla et al .",
    "@xcite a collisional width of @xmath50 was extracted , which exceeds the @xmath0 decay width in vacuum by more than a factor 10 .",
    "this means that the in - medium peak should be considerably smeared out , making it much harder to observe @xcite .",
    "moreover , not all of the in - medium decays happen at full nuclear density @xmath51 in the center of the nucleus .",
    "every nucleus has a diffuse surface with a slowly dropping density distribution .",
    "the fraction of @xmath0 mesons decaying at the surface will further smear out the in - medium peak , if we expect a density - dependent mass drop .",
    "this holds for any decay mode of the @xmath0 meson .    for the @xmath3 channel , an additional limitation of the usefulness of the invariant mass spectrum as an indicator for in - medium effects is the strong final - state interaction ( fsi ) of the @xmath2 daughter particle .",
    "most previous studies concentrated on the fact that the background created by rescattered pions can be suppressed by kinetic energy cuts @xcite .",
    "little attention was paid to the fact that the pion fsi selectively favors decays at small densities . if a @xmath2 from an @xmath0 decay scatters with a nucleon , there are two possibilities : either the collision is inelastic , leading to an absorption of the @xmath2 ( @xmath52 ) , possibly due to charge exchange ( e.g.  @xmath53 ) ; or the collision is elastic ( @xmath54 ) , which typically causes an energy loss of the pion in the laboratory , so that the reconstructed @xmath3 invariant mass is changed dramatically . in both cases",
    "the event is basically unusable for the @xmath0 reconstruction , since the original @xmath0 in - medium mass is lost .",
    "the fsi has dramatic consequences for the in - medium part of the @xmath3 mass spectrum .",
    "decay products coming from high densities at the center of the nucleus have little chance of making it outside without rescattering , so that mostly those from the surface will be observed , which carry little information on medium modifications .",
    "this means that the pion fsi cuts away most of the in - medium peak , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass1 ] , and even in the very unlikely scenario of a pure mass shift , only a minor in - medium contribution to the spectrum is left . in the scenarios including collisional",
    "broadening , the in - medium peak is already broadened so strongly , that even without any fsi of the decay products , it would be hard to unambiguously measure a medium modification of the spectrum and to distinguish it from the background .",
    "although a much smaller effect of pion fsi was obtained in @xcite , this calculation also supports our conclusion that the @xmath3 invariant mass distribution is not very sensitive to in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig : mass1 ] includes the mass resolution of the cbelsa / taps detector , incorporated by folding the spectrum with a gaussian distribution of 19 mev width .",
    "however , we have verified that the mass resolution of the detector is not a limiting factor , and that even an improvement of this resolution would not dramatically increase the chances of being able to observe any in - medium modification .",
    "mesons in photoproduction on nb , @xmath55 , as a function of density ( topmost line ) .",
    "also shown are the @xmath1 decay points without ( middle line ) and with ( lowest line ) pion fsi.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the density distributions of the production and decay point ( with and without fsi ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] .",
    "while the production density has a clear peak at full nuclear density , the decay point tends to lie in the vacuum due to the rather long lifetime of the @xmath0 meson ( @xmath56 ) . on top of this",
    ", the fsi of the decay pion further decreases the sensitivity to high densities .",
    "additional cuts on the pion kinetic energy or the @xmath3 invariant mass can further reduce the reconstructed events from high densities .    in summary , we conclude that the @xmath3 decay channel is clearly inferior for invariant mass analyses compared to e.g. @xmath57 , mainly due to pion fsi .",
    "moreover , we note that in general mass spectrum analyses are better suited for more short - lived mesons ( like the @xmath4 ) , which have a larger probability of decaying in the medium .",
    "another way of investigating the in - medium properties of the @xmath0 meson is to measure its absorption as a function of nuclear mass number @xmath58 .",
    "this method only gives information on the collisional width , but not on a possible mass shift .",
    "it does not require the measurement of actual in - medium decays , as is the case for the mass spectrum , but can rely completely on the four - momenta of the final decay products in vacuum .",
    "however , since pion fsi may decrease the number of finally reconstructed @xmath0 mesons the transparency itself does not give directly the attenuation of @xmath0 mesons alone , but has to rely on state - of - the - art transport calculations to extract the actual in - medium width . only in the case of large collisional widths the pion",
    "fsi become negligible @xcite .",
    "the so - called transparency ratio ( normalized to @xmath59 ) is defined as :    @xmath60    the first measurement of this quantity was performed by the cbelsa / taps collaboration via @xmath3 decays in photoproduction experiments @xcite . by assuming a low density approximation , an inelastic @xmath27 cross section of about @xmath61 and its momentum dependence were deduced from the measured transparency .",
    "more recently , it was claimed in @xcite that the cbelsa / taps data can be described by a much lower total @xmath27 cross section on the order of @xmath62 .",
    "however , we note that the treatment presented there assumed a fixed photon energy of 1.5@xmath36for comparison with the cbelsa / taps data , instead of the full bremsstrahlung energy spectrum of @xmath63 used in the experiment . using a fixed photon energy might be sufficient to describe the momentum - integrated transparency ratio , but it will certainly distort the momentum dependence .    , using @xmath31 .",
    "top : obtained via the @xmath3 decay , with @xmath64 , bottom : obtained from the dilepton decay , in comparison to the @xmath3 data from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] , using @xmath31 .",
    "top : obtained via the @xmath3 decay , with @xmath64 , bottom : obtained from the dilepton decay , in comparison to the @xmath3 data from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results obtained with the gibuu model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr ] . to properly describe the data , we need to modify the inelastic @xmath27 cross section by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "our model yields a rather flat momentum dependence for the @xmath3 transparency ratio .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the transparency ratio obtained via dilepton decays ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr ] bottom ) is mostly compatible with the @xmath3 result , and only shows slight deviations at low momenta , which confirms that this observable is not strongly affected by pion fsi .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 transparency ratio has also been measured via dilepton decays from photon - induced reactions on nuclei by the clas collaboration at jefferson lab @xcite . however , the clas data show a significantly larger absorption than the cbelsa / taps data , which currently can not be explained by any of the theoretical models ( including ours ) .",
    "moreover , the dilepton data recently measured by the hades collaboration @xcite could provide further constraints on the @xmath0 absorption in nuclear matter .",
    "an @xmath0 peak has been identified in both pp and pnb reactions at the same beam energy of 3.5 gev .",
    "however , there are two obstacles for extracting the @xmath0 absorption cross section : first , the @xmath0 peak needs to be separated from an underlying background ( mostly due to the @xmath4 meson ) , whose shape is nontrivial already in pp , and might be further modified in pnb @xcite .",
    "second , only a reference from pp collisions is available , and the @xmath0 production from pn collisions in not well constrained .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the @xmath0 excitation function , i.e. the total @xmath0 photoproduction cross section on a nucleus @xmath66 , is sensitive to in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 meson . in particular , a downward mass shift of the @xmath0 in medium would lower the threshold for @xmath0 photoproduction and increase the cross section due to the enlarged phase space , which could be determined in an excitation function measurement .    fig .  [",
    "fig : exf ] shows the energy - dependent @xmath0 photoproduction cross section on c and nb ( observed through the @xmath3 decay ) for photon energies from threshold up to 1.5@xmath36 . while the collisional broadening scenario",
    "only slightly enhances the subthreshold contributions ( which presumably would be hard to measure , since the cross sections become very small there ) , the scenarios including a mass shift exhibit a much stronger enhancement , even above the free @xmath0 production threshold of @xmath67 .",

    "fig : mass1 ] .",
    "the dashed line indicates @xmath0 photoproduction threshold on a free proton of @xmath67.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is important to note that the modification of the excitation function is proportional to the density at the production point , in contrast to the mass spectrum modifications discussed above , which are proportional to the density at the decay point .",
    "in addition to the previously established methods discussed in the preceding sections , we propose here a new method for extracting in - medium properties of the @xmath0 meson from photoproduction data .",
    "our simulations show that the momentum spectrum of @xmath0 mesons produced on a nucleus is sensitive to medium modifications of the @xmath0 properties .",
    "this effect is due to the kinematics in the @xmath0 production process , which is altered by the @xmath0 s medium modifications .",
    "when an @xmath0 is produced with a lower mass , then , on average , it s total energy is lower .",
    "furthermore , the meson has to come back to its free vacuum mass on its way out of the nucleus ; the necessary energy is obtained by converting kinetic energy into mass .",
    "this conversion process lowers the momentum .",
    "[ fig : mom ] shows the momentum spectrum of a @xmath69+nb reaction with photon energies in the range of 0.9 - 1.3 @xmath36 .",
    "an invariant mass cut of @xmath70 was used to select the relevant @xmath0 mass region and to remove events with @xmath2 rescattering .",
    "it should be noted that the momentum distribution is quite sensitive to the angular distribution of the @xmath0 production process .",
    "the angular distributions used in the simulation properly reproduce the measurements on the free proton @xcite . for better comparison , the different curves are normalized to have the same integral .",
    "one can see that , while the collisional broadening scenario is hardly distinguishable from the vacuum curve , in the scenarios involving mass shift the momentum distribution is clearly shifted ( the maximum of the distribution shows a clear offset and also the average is shifted by about 25 - 50 @xmath71 ) .",
    "this means that a measurement of the @xmath3 momentum distribution might be used to determine the existence and magnitude of an in - medium mass shift of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "preliminary data @xcite seem to indicate that the in - medium scenarios involving mass shifts are disfavored .",
    "momentum distribution for @xmath69+nb at @xmath72 .",
    "the average momenta for the different in - medium scenarios are given in brackets ( in gev).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have evaluated various approaches for the determination of in - medium properties of the @xmath0 meson in cold nuclear matter via the @xmath3 decay in photoproduction experiments .",
    "our analysis shows that the lineshape analysis of the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum suffers mainly from the hadronic fsi of the pion , which drastically reduces the sensitivity to medium modifications .",
    "this means that even if the @xmath0 mass was shifted in the medium , it would be very hard to detect it via the @xmath3 mass spectrum .",
    "potentially larger effects could be expected from two other methods of determining the in - medium mass of the @xmath0 : the excitation function and the momentum spectrum .",
    "both are sensitive to the density at the production place of the meson , and not at the decay location ( as is the case for the lineshape ) .    the transparency ratio , on the other hand , yields a reliable determination of the @xmath0 absorption cross section .",
    "it is not as sensitive to pion fsi , since it relies mostly on decays of @xmath0 mesons outside the medium .",
    "however , it can not make any statement about an in - medium mass shift of the @xmath0 .",
