    "the weyl formalism for static axisymmetric vacuum solutions in 3 + 1 dimensions allows one to write down a solution that represents an arbitrary number of collinear neutral black holes held in unstable equilibrium by a system of struts and strings @xcite .",
    "the metric is constructed using the newtonian potential of a number of collinear rods of differing lengths and the same mass per unit length .",
    "the thermodynamics of such configurations has been studied recently in @xcite .",
    "the weyl construction was used by myers to produce an infinite periodic array of neutral black holes , in which case the strings and struts disappear @xcite .",
    "it has also been long known that the c - metric for an accelerating black hole has an interesting weyl form @xcite .",
    "it is constructed from the newtonian potential of a semi - infinite - line - mass ( silm ) and a second , finite , rod .",
    "the silm is the position of the acceleration horizon and the finite rod is the position of the black hole horizon .",
    "there is necessarily a cosmic string or strut in the spacetime which provides the force accelerating the black hole .",
    "it is now easy to guess the form of the metric which describes a number , @xmath3 , of collinear black holes all accelerating in the same direction .",
    "it is constructed from the newtonian potential of a silm and @xmath3 finite non - overlapping collinear rods of arbitrary lengths .",
    "we examine the @xmath4 case in detail .",
    "we show that the interpretation as two accelerating black holes is valid . in the `` newtonian limit '' where the accelerations are small compared to the inverse masses of the black holes ,",
    "newton s law holds for each black hole with the acceleration produced by a combination of the forces due to any deficit angle cosmic strings or struts present and the gravitational attraction of the other black hole .",
    "we show that the parameters may be chosen so that the outer black hole is pulled along by a cosmic string and the inner black hole follows behind accelerated purely by its gravitational attraction to the outer one .",
    "a similar solution can be found for the @xmath5 case , in which the only deficit angle along the axis is a cosmic string attached to the outermost black hole and the other two are accelerated by gravitational forces alone .",
    "we conjecture that similar solutions exist for any number of black holes .",
    "any static axisymmetric vacuum solution of the einstein equations may be written in the following form [ weylone.eq ] ds^2 = ^2 ( dr^2 + dz^2 ) + r^2 ^-2 d^2 - ^2 dt^2 where @xmath6,@xmath7 are functions of @xmath8,@xmath9 . by using the substitutions @xmath10",

    "the newtonian potential used for @xmath12 is the sum of the potentials of a number of finite nonoverlapping rods placed along the @xmath9-axis and the function @xmath14 is found by quadrature .",
    "explicitly , let there be @xmath3 rods each centred at @xmath16 , @xmath17 , of length @xmath18 and with mass / unit length @xmath19 .",

    "they both have mass / unit length @xmath28 as before .",
    "we are clearly free to choose the origin of @xmath9 coordinates to be wherever we like and so we fix it by requiring that the following three equations have a solution for @xmath29 and @xmath30 [ aandm.eq ] 2 a c_i^3 - c_i^2 + m^2 = 0 , i = 0,1,2  .",
    "in particular this means that @xmath31 .",

    "in the maximally extended form of the ordinary c - metric above there are actually two accelerating black holes , one covered by the coordinates shown above and the other on the opposite side of the acceleration horizon , accelerating in the opposite direction and out of causal contact with the first .",
    "it is possible however to construct metrics in which there are two ( or more ) black holes on the same side of a common acceleration horizon , accelerating in the same direction .",
    "( these then each have their `` mirror black hole '' on the other side of the acceleration horizon but we will be ignoring these in what follows . ) these are formed by taking the weyl form with a potential constructed from a silm and two ( or more ) finite rods along the z - axis .",

    "it is possible to choose the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath77 so that @xmath78 .",
    "indeed this condition implies ( c_0-c_4)(c_1-c_2 ) = ( c_0-c_2)(c_3-c_4 ) which can be rewritten as ( c_1-c_2)= ( c_3-c_4 ) and finally as ( c_3 - c_4 ) = ( c_1-c_2)(c_0-c_3 ) ( c_0-c_1)^-1  .",
    "any choice of @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be made and @xmath81 is then fixed .",
    "but it is not possible to have either @xmath82 or @xmath83 , which is not a surprise given the same is true for the c - metric .",
    "thus , on euclideanizing the solution we may choose the period of imaginary time to make both black hole horizons regular but if we do so there will be a conical singularity at the acceleration horizon .",
    "we check that in the weak field limit , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath84 and @xmath85 and when the distance between the black holes is large compared to their masses , the acceleration of bh2 is given by newton s laws .",

    "we have the following c_0-c_1 & & 12a - m + o(ma ) + c_1-c_2 & & 2 m + o((ma)^2 ) + c_0-c_3 & & 12 - + o ( ) + c_3-c_4 & & 2 + o(()^2 )  .",
    "the net force outwards ( to the left ) on bh2 due to the combination of possible strings and struts is given by t_2 = 14expanding this out and setting @xmath89 we find [ newtontwo.eq ] t_2 = + mr^2 + correction the first terms of the correction are cubic in @xmath90 and @xmath91 and quadratic in @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in order for the above to be a consistent approximation",
    "we require that @xmath94 not be fixed but tends to infinity in such a way that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are larger than @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the limit .",
    "we might choose , for example , @xmath95 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 fixed and @xmath96 .    similarly the net force to the left ( towards bh2 ) on bh1 due to the strings and/or struts is t_1 = 14 and in the same limit as above this gives [ newtonone.eq ] t_1 = m a - mr^2 + correction    then ( [ newtontwo.eq ] ) and ( [ newtonone.eq ] ) show that the acceleration of each black hole is due to the net tension on it due to the strings and/or struts together with the gravitational attraction of the other black hole .",
    "we can ask , is it possible to choose the period of @xmath33 so that bh1 is free of strings or struts so that its acceleration is due entirely to its gravitational attraction towards bh2 ?",
    "the condition for this is @xmath97 .",
    "this reduces to the condition [ nostrings.eq ] ( c_0-c_1)(c_3-c_4 ) = ( c_1-c_4)(c_2-c_3 )  .",
    "this can be satisfied by choosing @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 arbitrarily .",
    "@xmath101 is independent and can be chosen to satisfy ( [ nostrings.eq ] ) .",
    "note that in the weak field limit as defined above this condition is approximately @xmath102 so indeed the acceleration of the black hole is due to its gravitational attraction towards the outer one .",
    "it is clear how to generalize the above results to the case of three or more black holes . in the case of three ,",
    "we add a third finite rod on the @xmath9-axis between @xmath103 and @xmath104 to the left of the existing two .",
    "the metric will be constructed from ( [ weyl2.eq ] ) by multiplying @xmath105 by @xmath106 and @xmath107 by the inverse of this .",
    "the rest of the metric is multiplied by a factor  . @xmath43 and @xmath6 will now be functions of the parameters @xmath108 such that the metric reduces to the known c - metric in the appropriate limits . adding more black holes proceeds similarly .",
    "we can again calculate the various periods required for regularity .",
    "we can also ask whether the @xmath38 may be chosen so that there is only one cosmic string pulling the outermost black hole with the others being accelerated purely because of the gravitational attraction of the others . this is a more difficult question to answer in the general case . in the case of three black holes",
    "there are two conditions , & c_14 c_23 c_16 c_25 c_02 = c_01 c_13 c_24 c_15 c_26 + & c_16 c_25 c_36 c_45 c_02 c_04 = c_01 c_03 c_15 c_26 c_35 c_46 where @xmath109 . these do have solutions with @xmath110 for @xmath111 , for example : c_6 = 0,c_5= a , c_4=a+1 , c_3=a+2 , c_2=a+3 , c_1=a+4 , c_0 = a + 4 + f where @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the positive root of @xmath114 .",
    "we conjecture that such solutions do exist for any number of black holes .",
    "then one could conceive of an accelerating version of the myers black hole array in which there is an infinite collinear array of accelerating black holes with a common acceleration horizon and no cosmic strings or struts in sight .",
    "we also conjecture that there are solutions with any number of accelerating black holes for which it would be possible to choose the period of imaginary time to be such that the euclidean solution is regular on all the black hole horizons at once .",
    "these multi accelerating black hole solutions are classically unstable , assuming that the deficit angles of the nodal singularities are fixed as they would be if the solutions are approximations to spacetimes with field theory cosmic strings of fixed tension",
    ". a little displacement of one of the black holes will disturb the balance of forces required to maintain the solution and presumably cause some black holes to collide and/or some to be left behind .",
    "this instability prevents us from asking whether the euclideanized solutions can be interpreted as instantons for multi - pair production of black holes or the production of some pairs in the background of other accelerating pairs .",
    "this is even before we confront the problem that the uncharged solutions do not give rise to regular instantons  even if we allow cosmic strings in space  because of the impossibility of matching the acceleration and black hole horizon temperatures .",
    "( nevertheless the euclidean action may straightforwardly be calculated as in @xcite since the singularities are conical and integrable .",
    "using the work in @xcite , calculating the action is just a matter or calculating the difference in the acceleration horizon areas between the instanton and background and the areas of the horizons of the black holes produced . )",
    "these problems might be resolved were we able to give charge to the black holes .",
    "the obvious method to try is that of the charging transformation given in @xcite .",
    "however this only works when the time coordinate is asymptotically minkowki time ( and in any case gives all the black holes the same charge to mass ratio and so might not be able to produce a regular instanton ) . here",
    ", our asymptotic time coordinate is rindler time and the charging transformation gives a new metric of unknown physical interpretation which has zero net charge at infinity .",
    "finding charged versions of these solutions requires more ingenuity .",
