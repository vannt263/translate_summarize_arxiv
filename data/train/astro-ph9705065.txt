    "the derivation of reliable stellar mass - functions ( mf ) down to the hydrogen burning limit is an essential task for the understanding of a wide variety of major astrophysical problems including star formation theory , stellar evolution , dynamical evolution of globular clusters , galactic formation and evolution . not mentioning the long - standing problem of the galactic missing mass . from the stellar point of view",
    ", the knowledge of the low - mass end of the mf provides essential information about the processus of star formation and the physics of the interiors and atmospheres of cool and dense objects . from the galactic point of view",
    ", the determination of the stellar mf down to the hydrogen burning limit is a key issue to derive the total amount of matter under the form of visible , stellar objects , which determines the mass - to - light ( @xmath11 ) ratio , and to infer the contribution of substellar objects , essentially brown dwarfs , to the galactic mass budget .",
    "the intrinsic faintness of very - low - mass stars ( vlms ) , and the small density of halo objects w.r.t . the disk population ( @xmath12 ,",
    "see e.g. bahcall , 1986 ; tyson , 1988 ) renders the determination of the luminosity function ( lf ) of halo stars down to the hydrogen burning limit a tremendously difficult task .",
    "the determination of globular cluster ( gc ) luminosity functions and mass functions is a first , easier step towards the determination of the population ii star initial mass function .",
    "moreover , the determination of the present day mf ( pdmf ) in gcs contains potential information about the dynamical history , evaporation and tidal stripping of the clusters , and thus about the galactic halo history . at last ,",
    "given the large range of metallicities covered by all observed gcs , it is possible to examine the dependence of the mf on metallicity , and to determine whether it is a universal property or if it is strongly affected by the metal content of the initial cloud .",
    "recent deep photometry observations of several gcs with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) yield an accurate determination of the bottom of the ms of these objects .",
    "these results extend previous ground - based observations to about 4 magnitudes fainter limits and allow an accurate determination of the cluster lfs down to the bottom of the ms , providing stringent constraints for theoretical models of metal - poor vlms .",
    "the derivation of accurate mfs from these observed lfs is a more delicate task .",
    "the mf is very sensitive to the mass - luminosity relation and thus the derivation of reliable mfs requires the calculations of accurate mass - luminosity relations .",
    "direct , observational mass determinations of vlms are available for solar metallicity objects only ( popper 1980 ; henry & mccarthy 1993 ) . no direct mass - determination has been obtained so far for metal - depleted low - mass stars .",
    "however the accuracy of the stellar models can be examined by confronting the theoretical color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) to the observed ones .",
    "such an extensive study has been conducted in a previous paper ( baraffe , chabrier , allard & hauschildt 1997 ; bcah ) where these authors have derived an extended set of low - mass star evolutionary models ( @xmath13 ) over a large range of metal - depleted abundances characteristic of old disk , globular cluster and halo populations , namely @xmath14 .",
    "the accuracy of these models has been demonstrated by the",
    "_ remarkable agreement _",
    "( @xmath15 mag ) between the theoretical and the observed cmds over the entire sequences , for _ all _ gcs , over the entire afore - mentioned metallicity range .",
    "the well known wavy behaviour of the stellar main sequence , which reflects genuine intrinsic properties of stellar matter , is reproduced qualitatively and _ quantitatively _",
    ", for the correct magnitudes and colors ( see bcah ) .",
    "as stressed by these authors , these models are not hampered by _ any _ adjustable parameter ( e.g. the mixing length ) and thus the agreement between theory and observation reflects the accuracy of the physics entering the models ( equation of state and _ non - grey _ atmosphere models ) .",
    "this assesses the reliability of these models to describe the mechanical and thermal properties of metal - poor low - mass stars down to the brown dwarf limit , and provides for the first time accurate relations between the mass , the age and observable quantities , magnitudes and colors , for different metallicities . for solar - like metallicity ,",
    "the accuracy of the mass - magnitude relation has been assessed by the agreement with the observed mass - spectral class ( kirkpatrick & mc carthy , 1994 ; kirkpatrick et al . , 1995 ) and mass-@xmath16 and mass-@xmath17 ( henry & mccarthy , 1993 ) relationships ( baraffe & chabrier , 1996 ; chabrier , baraffe & plez , 1996 ; chabrier & baraffe , 1997b ) .    in this paper , we use the mass - luminosity relationships obtained with the afore - mentioned metal - depleted models to derive the mass - functions characteristic of several gcs observed with the hst and of halo field stars .",
    "the observations are summarized in  2 and converted into _ bolometric _ lfs . in  3 , we derive the mfs for the different clusters and we examine the dependence of these mfs upon metallicity , location in the cluster and galactic position of the cluster .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the derivation of the _ halo _ mf and  5 to the conclusion .",
    "until recently , derivations of stellar lfs in gcs down to faint absolute magnitudes have been based on observations made from the ground , thus suffering from crowding effects and uncertain completeness corrections ( see e.g. richer et al .",
    "data from the hst have now become available for several gcs down to @xmath18 magnitudes fainter limits ( @xmath19 ) without the need for large completeness corrections , spaning a large range of metallicity from solar to 1% solar .",
    "the ms is sharp and well defined down to almost the limit of the observations , which corresponds to @xmath20 ( bcah ) , and the lfs are essentially complete ( within @xmath21 ) down to this limit .",
    "these observations are presented and discussed in  2 of bcah , with the different parameters , distance moduli and reddening corrections , used for these clusters .",

    "although the ground - based lfs were generally rising down to the limit of the observations ( @xmath45 ) , most of the lfs derived with the hst show a clear decline beyond this limit .    a comparison between the lfs of some of the afore - mentioned clusters , namely @xmath46 , @xmath5 and @xmath47 , has been done by cool et al .",

    "the lfs are found to be very similar , down to the limit of the observations , except for the faint end of @xmath47 .",
    "the clusters have been observed in different passbands characteristic of the hst , namely @xmath48 , @xmath49 and f@xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the standard johnson - cousins ( jc ) system .",

    ", we show the _ bolometric _ lfs , corrected for incompleteness , for the afore - mentioned clusters , using the published lfs and the bolometric corrections of chabrier & baraffe ( 1997a ) and bcah .",
    "we have used cubic spline interpolations to interpolate the relations m@xmath53 and their derivatives dm@xmath54/d@xmath55 ( global polynomial fits are _ not _ reliable ) .",
    "we verified that lfs of the same cluster observed in _",
    "different passbands _ yield the _ same _ bolometric lf .",
    "this adds credibility to the present bolometric corrections and stellar models .",
    "we believe these results to illustrate consistent comparisons between the lfs of various clusters , over a large range of metallicities , from near solar to @xmath56 .",
    "the lfs have been normalized arbitrarily to @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 over the present range of metallicity .",
    "for all the considered gcs , both the degree of completeness and of photometric accuracy are maximum in this region and stellar evolution effects do not affect this mass range , even for the older clusters .",
    "in table i , we give the galactocentric position @xmath59 , the height above or below the galactic plane @xmath60 and the metallicity for the various clusters .",
    "these values have been averaged over the slightly different values found in the literature .",
    "we also give the location of the observations w.r.t . the half - mass radius @xmath61 .",
    "some indetermination ( @xmath62 mag ) remains for the distance modulus of various clusters , as quoted by the different observers .",
    "we have carried out calculations with the different values and found that the resulting uncertainty in the mfs remains within the observational error bars .",
    "the extinction corrections are the ones quoted in table i of bcah and in the different references corresponding to the observations .    as seen in fig .",
    "1 , all lfs exhibit a similar qualitative behaviour in the region @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 , @xmath65 , with a rising slope @xmath66 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "below this limit , some differences appear between the various clusters . whereas some lfs , e.g. for @xmath47 , exhibit a flattish behaviour , most of them drop more or less rapidly at the faint end .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , these different behaviours , and the respective magnitudes corresponding to the _ peak _ in the lfs of the clusters , reflect the dependence of the mass - magnitude relationship on metallicity , from a rather universal mass - function .",
    "the effect of metallicity in the mass - magnitude relationship translates into a slightly different location for the peak of the luminosity function , corresponding to @xmath68 , lower metallicities yielding brighter magnitudes for the same mass , an intrinsic property of stellar matter ( see bcah ) .",
    "the case of @xmath5 deserves particular attention , for there is a substantial _ qualitative _ difference in the faint end of the lf for this cluster between the observations of paresce et al .",
    "( 1995b ) and cool et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . whereas paresce et al .",
    "get a strongly decreasing lf , cool et al .",
    "argue for a milder decrease , or even for a flattish behaviour at the faint end of the lf .",
    "since both observations were completed in a similar region of the cluster ( @xmath69 ) , the difference can not stem from different mass segregation effects .",
    "a natural explanation would be incompleteness at faint magnitudes in the paresce et al .",
    "sample but this hypothesis seems to be excluded by these authors .",
    "a third explanation would be the bias in the observed lf due to bining at faint magnitudes .",
    "this point will be discussed in detail in  4 . in any case",
    ", this uncertainty prevents an accurate determination of the mass function ( mf ) at the bottom of the ms for @xmath5 , and stresses the need for further observations of this cluster .",
    "these various lfs were obtained at similar location in the clusters , between @xmath70 and 3 times the half - mass radius ( see table i ) , assuming that the present half-_light _ radius is close to the half - mass radius , a reasonable assumption ( djorgovski , 1993 ) . in any case",
    "the region where the lfs have been determined is well inside the tidal radius . as discussed below",
    ", this is the best location to obtain a pdmf as similar as possible to the _ initial _ mf ( imf ) , although dynamical evolution may have shaped it to some extent .    in summary ,",
    "the different lfs seem to be marginally similar down to @xmath71 , in spite of the very different metallicities .",
    "whether this apparent non - dependence of the lf upon metallicity will translate into a similar uncorrelation in the _ mass - function _ depends on the degree of correlation of the _ mass - luminosity _ relationship with metallicity , as examined below .",
    "as already mentioned , the agreement between the observed gc main sequences and the theoretical bcah ones over the _ entire _",
    "sequences is excellent , less than 0.1 mag , for all clusters .",
    "in particular the models reproduce accurately the two changes in the slope of the color - magnitude relation , near @xmath72 and below @xmath73 , which reflect intrinsic physical properties of the atmosphere and the interior of vlms ( see chabrier & baraffe , 1997a ) . these comparisons asses the validity of the calibration of low - mass stars from the observed colors and magnitudes , as given in bcah and in chabrier & baraffe ( 1997a ) . as demonstrated in the afore - mentioned papers , relationships based on _ grey _ atmosphere models and @xmath74 relationships yield inaccurate , or at best unreliable , @xmath75 and @xmath76 relationships over the entire low - mass star domain , and most importantly near the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "this translates directly into unreliable mfs , thus biaising any attempt to derive robust conclusions .",
    "we stress also the importance of using an accurate representation of the @xmath75 relation when deriving mass functions . given the severe variations of the slope of this relation along the lms range , a global polynomial fit , in particular , is a very poor and misleading representation .",
    "a polynomial fit does _ not _ reproduce all the points of the @xmath75 relation and can lead to severely erroneous mfs , in particular near the bottom of the ms .",
    "the lfs discussed in  2 have been converted into mfs , for the appropriate metallicities , and are displayed on fig .",
    "2 . as shown in fig . 2 , _ all _ mfs are rising monotonically down to the limit of the observations , i.e. @xmath77 , close to the hydrogen burning limit , except possibly for @xmath46 where the mf flattens below @xmath73 .",
    "this shows convincingly that the decrease of the luminosity function near the faint end does not reflect a lack of stars but instead the _ severe drop in the mass - luminosity relationship near the bottom of the ms _ and thus the scarcity of stars over large magnitude intervals for @xmath78 ( see e.g. dantona & mazzitelli , 1996 ; chabrier & baraffe , 1997a ) .",
    "we stress again that lfs observed in different filters , for a same cluster , yield similar mfs .",
    "the mfs shown in fig . 2 for the different clusters are displayed by increasing metallicity from top to bottom , from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "we recall that , given the enrichment of halo and globular star clusters in @xmath81-elements , an observed @xmath82 for metal - poor stars corresponds to a solar - mix scaled metallicity @xmath83 ( ryan & norris , 1991 ; see bcah for details ) .",
    "a first interesting result is that , except for the mf of @xmath5 derived from the paresce et al .",
    "( 1995b ) lf , _ all _ mfs are fairly well represented by simple power laws @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "the second striking result is the weak variation of the slope of the mf with metallicity , with @xmath86 to 1.5 .",
    "this dependence on metallicity is pondered to some extent by the location of the clusters in the galaxy .",
    "this influence , however , remains weak as long as the clusters are located far enough ( @xmath87 kpc ) from both the disk and the galactic center , as shown for example for @xmath88 or @xmath89 , located about 1 kpc above the galactic plane , which have a slope similar to or steeper than @xmath90 , of comparable metallicity , located @xmath91 kpc above the plane .",
    "in the same vein , @xmath92 is found to have a slighly steeper mf than @xmath93 , for the same metallicity , although it lies closer to the galactic center .",
    "this shows that there is no direct link between the mf near @xmath61 and the location in the galaxy and that some _ internal _ dynamical process , namely mass segregation , may have slightly modified the imf of the clusters near the half - mass radius .",
    "although the _ last bin _ of @xmath94 seems to indicate a decrease at the faint end of the mf , this feature is likely to stem from incompleteness due to crowding near the bottom of the ms ( demarchi & paresce , 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , however , both the mf of @xmath94 and @xmath5 , as observed by demarchi & paresce , seem to indicate a flattening below @xmath95 ( although the error bars in ngc6656 are consistent with a slowly rising mf ) , as suggested by these authors .",
    "even though both clusters have similar galactic positions ( see table i ) , they have quite different orbits and thus have experienced different dynamical histories ( demarchi & paresce , 1997 ) .",
    "this prompted these authors to suggest that this behaviour is an intrinsic properties of gc s .",
    "we note , however , that this result differs from the ones obtained for all the other clusters and more importantly from observations of the same cluster ( @xmath5 ) by cool et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( see below ) , as mentioned previously . solving this issue",
    "requires further observations of these clusters near the bottom of the ms .",
    "the case of @xmath46 is also of particular interest , for the mf of this relatively metal - rich cluster seems to flatten off below @xmath73 , although the lack of observations beyond this limit prevents robust conclusions .",
    "the detailed study of the mf of metal - rich clusters and field stars is presently under work ( chabrier , mra & baraffe , 1997 ) .",
    "the similitude between the mfs of the different clusters , all determined at radial distances near the half mass radius , seems to confirm that the stellar population in this region is not very sensitive at least to external dynamical processes .",
    "in particular , given its large distance from the galactic plane and from the galactic center , @xmath96 is believed to have an almost uncontaminated mf , and is thus of particular importance for the understanding of the dynamical evolution of gcs .",
    "it is instructive to note that the mf of @xmath96 ( and @xmath90 ) is very similar to the one of clusters located closer to the galactic plane , although these clusters are expected to have experienced quite different dynamical histories , in particular very different tidal stripping and disk / bulge shocking , resulting in a substantially different fraction of vlms at the periphery .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the indetermination near the faint end of the lf for @xmath5 translates into a difference in the mf below @xmath97 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the _ two _ lfs of cool et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( in the @xmath98 and @xmath99 filters ) yield a monotonic , rising mf , whereas the lf of paresce et al .",
    "( 1995 ) yields a flattish mf below 0.3 @xmath8 , although with large error bars near the faint end .",
    "the difference remains when using any of the two distance moduli quoted for this cluster and stems from the very difference at the faint end of the two lfs .",
    "for this reason , we will leave this cluster aside for the rest of the discussion until more observations can nail down this issue .",
    "note that the low galactic position of @xmath5 , @xmath100 kpc , its proximity to the galactic center , and its likeky collapsed state suggest that this cluster has experienced severe disk and bulge shocking , resulting in an accumulation of low - mass stars at the periphery and a substantial depletion even near @xmath61 .",
    "note also that the relatively short half - mass relaxation time of ngc6397 ( @xmath101 yr ; djorgovski et al . , 1993 ) may have led already to substantial evaporation in this region .",
    "this might provide a simple explanation for the mf inferred from paresce et al .",
    "data and to explain the fact that @xmath5 has a shallower mf , and thus a smaller amount of lms than clusters of similar metallicity , e.g. @xmath92 . on the opposite , if the mf keeps rising near the bottom of the ms , as inferred from the cool et al .",
    "lf , the similarity of the mf with the ones of clusters located far from the galactic plane shows that even strong tidal stripping and disk shocking does not _",
    "strongly _ affect the inner regions of the cluster , near @xmath102 .",
    "an interesting information about tidal stripping and mass segregation in @xmath5 arises from the observations of mould et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who obtained the lf of the cluster with the hst at a larger radial distance than the afore - mentioned observations , namely at 10 arcmin from the center , i.e. @xmath103 . the mf obtained from mould et al .",
    "lf is shown in fig .",
    "3 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the steeper slope ( @xmath104 instead of @xmath86 ) and thus the larger number of very low - mass stars ( @xmath105 ) w.r.t . to the previous determinations closer to @xmath61 illustrates the onset of tidal striping and mass segregation , yielding an excess of very - low - mass stars in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "therefore it is not excluded that vlms near @xmath61 may already have been stripped in this cluster . in any case",
    ", it shows that _ no _ robust conclusion about the imf of gcs can be inferred at present from the observations of @xmath5 , and probably not from any cluster located at low galactic latitude .",
    "the core relaxation times of the present clusters are @xmath106 yr , at least one order of magnitude less that the ages of the clusters , so that we expect the stars near the central core of the clusters to be close to thermal equilibrium",
    ". therefore low - mass stars in the core should be substantially depleted as a result of mass segregation .",
    "the half - mass radius is in general about 50 times larger than the core radius , so that we expect mass segregation to be mild in this region .",
    "the effect of mass segregation in gcs has been demonstrated by various investigations of the _ core _ ( @xmath107 ) of different clusters ( demarchi & paresce , 1996 ; paresce et al . , 1995a ;",
    "king et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the severe deficiency of faint stars in the center of the clusters translates into a strongly decreasing mf below @xmath108 .",
    "this reflects the effect of mass segregation in the central core , due to two - body relaxation , as expected from nearly thermodynamic equilibrium , providing the time for core collapse is much larger than the half - mass relaxation time , which is the case in general .",
    "this result is confirmed by the analysis of king , sosin & cool ( 1995 ) who examined the relation between the _ local _ mf of the cluster , as determined presently , and the _ global _ mf , using a dynamical model for the evolution of the cluster . as shown by these authors , whereas the mf determined in the central core is severely affected by mass segregation , the mf determined near the half - mass radius is quite similar to the global mf .",
    "the observations of gcs in near infrared colors will soon be possible with the hst nicmos camera , in the @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 filters , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are defined in the cit system .",
    "mass - magnitude relationships and cmds have been derived by bcah in these filters . in figures 4a - c",
    ", we show the predicted _ luminosity functions _ in these filters for @xmath116 , as obtained with three different _ rising _ mfs ( @xmath85 ) and a flat mf ( @xmath117 ) beyond 0.2 @xmath8 .",
    "the lfs are normalized to @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the total number of stars between 0.8 @xmath8 , about the turn - off mass , and the hydrogen burning limit , which corresponds to magnitudes @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively , for the appropriate metallicity , as given in bcah .",
    "the slope of the mf , at least for @xmath122 , could be determined by future observations from differential comparisons of the star counts on each side of the peak of the lf , _ providing accurate completeness corrections_. steeper mfs yield more ( resp .",
    "less ) vlms below ( resp . above )",
    "@xmath73 , which corresponds to the bright peak in the lfs .",
    "a flat mf yield a larger number of stars and a small plateau between @xmath123 , followed by an abrupt drop .",
    "the effect of metallicity on the lf is illustrated in figure 4d for @xmath124 .",
    "although the qualitative behaviour of the lf remains the same , the effect of metallicity is a global shift of the lf toward slightly brighter magnitudes with decreasing metallicity , a direct consequence of the metallicity dependence of the mass - magnitude relationship ( see bcah , chabrier & baraffe , 1997a ) . the effect , however , remains small and shows the weak dependence of the lf upon metallicity , at least for metal - depleted objects .",
    "an other interesting feature about these lfs is the expected _ brown dwarf _ signature , as illustrated by the peak at faint magnitudes in figs .",
    "the gap in the lf stems from the large luminosity drop in the mass - luminosity relationship in the stellar to substellar transition domain , which corresponds to several magnitudes over a few hundreths of a solar mass , whereas the sharp increase reflects the flatter slope of this relation in the brown dwarf regime .",
    "we stopped our calculations at @xmath125 , which corresponds to the coolest non - grey model atmospheres presently available .",
    "this is enough to illustrate the unmissing signature of even a moderate bd population in gcs , as obtained with the mentioned mfs .",
    "interestingly enough , we note that the gap in the lf varies significantly with the filters , which reflects the strong variation of the bd energy distribution in the near infrared frequency domain . even in the most favorable case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath126 , the genuine brown dwarf domain lies @xmath18 mag below the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "this sets the scale for bd search in gcs .",
    "the mass under the form of brown dwarfs in gcs is determined by :    @xmath127    where a is the normalization of the mf @xmath128 .",
    "we have normalized all the mfs at @xmath129 @xmath8 , as mentioned previously ( see  2 ) .",
    "the value @xmath130 is the hydrogen burning minimum mass for @xmath116 and about it for metal - poor stars in general ( chabrier & baraffe , 1997a ) whereas @xmath131 is the minimum mass of the brown dwarf imf .",
    "since this quantity is presently unknown , the _ maximum _ brown dwarf contribution corresponds to @xmath132 , since the integral is convergent ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "a more realistic value @xmath134 , which corresponds to the deuterium burning minimum mass ( saumon et al . , 1996 ) and to the minimum jeans mass at zero - metallicity ( silk , 1977 ) does not change the results significantly , given the small contribution of the lowest masses for weakly rising mfs .",
    "even the steepest mf @xmath135 yields a brown dwarf contribution @xmath136 of the stellar mass fraction below 0.8 @xmath8 , about the cluster turn - off mass . a flat mf or a larger minimum mass @xmath131 yield essentially no mass ( @xmath137 ) in the brown dwarf domain .",
    "these calculations show that , even though there might be a substantial _ number _ of bds in gcs ( rising mf ) , their _ mass _ fraction is fairly small .",
    "this confirms that there is essentially no dark matter in gcs .",
    "if the pdmf slope is not strongly correlated with the metallicity , we expect the imf for gcs to be rather similar to that of the disk and the halo .",
    "this issue is addressed below .",

    "the mass segregation effect is illustrated by the severe depletion of very low - mass stars in the central core of these clusters , as reflected by the dropping mf below @xmath245 , and by the excess of these objects , as shown by the substantially steeper mf , in the outer field of @xmath5 .",
    "we have derived predicting lfs in the nicmos filters , corresponding to either slightly rising or flat mfs for the different clusters , down to the brown dwarf domain .",
    "comparison between these predictions and near - future observations should determine accurately the mf of globular clusters all the way down to the hydrogen burning limit and the brown dwarf population .",
    "we have applied these calculations to the determination of the _ halo _ mass function , from the observed luminosity functions of high - velocity low - mass stars in the stellar neighborhood and from the direct photometric determination at faint magnitudes .",

    "the drop in the lf reflects the scarcity of objects over large magnitude intervals near the very bottom of the main sequence .",
    "comparison with star counts at faint magnitudes obtained with the hubble deep field are consistent with the afore - mentioned halo mf and with a @xmath247 old disk with a scale height @xmath208 kpc , which contributes at least @xmath10 50% of the lf down to @xmath248 , @xmath141 .",

    "<S> we use recent low - mass star models , which reproduce accurately the observed sequences of various globular clusters , to convert the observed luminosity functions into bolometric _ </S>",
    "<S> luminosity functions_. these latter are shown to exhibit a similar behaviour with a rising slope up to @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath1 , and a decreasing behaviour beyond this limit . </S>",
    "<S> we then derive _ mass functions _ for globular star clusters down to the bottom of the main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> these mass functions are well described by a slowly _ rising _ power - law @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , down to @xmath4 , independently of the metallicity , suggesting a rather universal behaviour of the cluster initial mass functions . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of tidal stripping and mass segregation are illustrated by the overabundance of very low - mass stars in the outer parts of @xmath5 and their depletion in the central parts . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis confirms that the mass function determined near the half - mass radius has been weakly affected by external and internal dynamical effects and reflects relatively closely the _ initial _ mass function . </S>",
    "<S> we predict luminosity functions in the nicmos filters in the stellar and in the brown dwarf domains for different mass functions and metallicities .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply these calculations to the determination of the mass function in the galactic halo , including the devaucouleurs spheroid and the @xmath6 dark halo . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the slope and the normalization of the spheroid mass function which is well described by the afore - mentioned power - law function with @xmath7 down to 0.1 @xmath8 , although a slowly decreasing mass function below @xmath9 can not be excluded with the data presently available . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the hubble deep field star counts is consistent with such a mass function and excludes a significant stellar population in the dark halo . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that essentially all the high - velocity subdwarfs observed in the solar neighborhood belong to the galactic spheroid .    </S>",
    "<S> consistent analysis with recent microlensing experiments towards the lmc shows that the spheroid and the dark - halo _ stellar+brown dwarf _ populations represent at most @xmath10 1% of the galactic dark matter density . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly excludes brown dwarfs and low - mass stars as significant dark matter candidates .    </S>",
