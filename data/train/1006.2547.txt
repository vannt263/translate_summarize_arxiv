    "one of the main objectives of linear collider experiments is the precision spectroscopy of new particles predicted in theories of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) . since some , or most , of these particles may have masses of @xmath1",
    ", these studies may be central to the physics program of a multi - tev @xmath2 linear collider , such as clic .    in this note , we study the production of the supersymmetric partners of the muon in a specific susy scenario , where we assume r  parity conservation within the so - called constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( cmssm ) . in this model the neutralino ( ) is the lightest supersymmetric particle and the specific parameters of the benchmark point  @xcite are chosen to make it compatible with current collider and cosmology data .",
    "in particular , the properties of the lightest neutralino are such that it generates the correct amount of relic dark matter density in the universe , as obtained from the analysis of the wmap data  @xcite . scalar muons ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are the supersymmetric partners of the right- and left - handed charged muons .",
    "smuons are produced in pair through @xmath5-channel @xmath6 exchange in the process @xmath0 and each decay into an ordinary muon and a neutralino , .",
    "the neutralino , being weakly - interacting , escapes detection .",
    "therefore , the experimental signature of the process is two oppositely charged muons plus missing energy .",
    "this study concentrates on the lightest smuon , @xmath3 , which , for the chosen model parameters , has a mass of 1108.8  gev , while the mass of the lightest neutralino is 554.3  gev .",
    "the accurate determination of their masses is an essential part of the spectroscopy study of a high mass susy scenario at clic .",
    "a study of the variation of the predicted relic dark mass density in the universe @xmath7 with the lightest neutralino mass in the cmssm shows that a @xmath81.0  gev uncertainty on its mass corresponds to a @xmath80.05 relative uncertainty on @xmath7 , i.e.  the current accuracy from cosmic microwave background observations  @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this study is to assess the requirements for a detector at clic operating at a centre - of - mass energy , @xmath9 , of 3  tev as a function of the track momentum resolution , luminosity spectrum and beam polarisation .",
    "the reconstruction of the particle masses through the endpoints of the muon momentum spectrum is a good example for these requirements since the analysis is particularly simple and can be carried out using a simple momentum smearing on generator - level observables .",
    "results are validated using full simulation and reconstruction with the clic - ild detector model .",
    "the simulation is performed for the cmssm parameters of point k of ref .  @xcite . in the cmssm",
    "the mass parameters are defined at the gut scale .",
    "the subsequent evolution to the electro - weak scale is performed using the renormalisation group equations of isasugra  7.69  @xcite .",
    "signal events are generated using pythia  6.125  @xcite . at 3 tev , the production cross section for the process @xmath10 , for unpolarised beams , is 0.71  fb .",
    "beamstrahlung effects on the luminosity spectrum are included using results of the clic beam simulation for the 2008 accelerator parameters  @xcite .",
    "initial state radiation ( isr ) is included in the event generation in pythia .",
    "the following background processes have been included in the background calculation :    [ h ]    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ tab : summary ]      this study allows us to draw some conclusions on the potential of a 3  tev clic collider in susy spectroscopic measurements and some of the requirements on the detector and the beams . because of the tiny production cross section in the chosen high - mass scenario , background subtraction is the dominant source of statistical uncertainty .",
    "electron beam polarisation at @xmath11  80  % gives an equivalent luminosity gain of a factor of six and is essential to recover precision .",
    "positron polarisation is desirable , since it gives an additional gain of a factor of two in equivalent luminosity and it also allows us to disentangle the contributions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "smuon and neutralino masses of 1108.8  gev and 554.3  gev , respectively can be extracted from the muon kinematics , in events with two oppositely charged muons and missing energy , with a relative statistical accuracy @xmath14  0.5  % with 2  ab@xmath15 of integrated luminosity and both beams polarised .",
    "in addition , the signal production cross section of 0.7 fb can be determined with a relative statistical uncertainty of 2.0  % .",
    "since a major source of smearing of the kinematic edges of the muon momentum spectrum is beamstrahlung and isr , the track momentum resolution does not appear to be critical for the measurement of the smuon mass , as long as a resolution @xmath16  gev@xmath15 can be achieved , though it remains important for the neutralino mass .",
    "it is important to have a good control of the luminosity spectrum and desirable to limit the beamstrahlung not significantly beyond that corresponding to the 2008 clic parameters .",
    "finally , the effect of the overlay of @xmath17 events from machine - induced background does not lead to any significant degradation of the signal selection efficiency for a detector with time stamping capability of 10  ns .",
    "we are grateful to daniel  schulte for making the luminosity spectrum and generated @xmath18 events available and to dieter schlatter for his careful reading of this note .",
