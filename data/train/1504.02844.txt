    "recently , the interest in the @xmath23 mixing has been renewed .",
    "new proposals for searching it @xcite have appeared , and the results of the first experiments reporting its discovery with the help of detectors ves @xcite and besiii @xcite have been presented .",
    "the ves collaboration was observed for the first time the isospin breaking decay @xmath24@xmath1@xmath25 @xcite , the proposal for searching it was put in ref .",
    "the besiii collaboration has obtained the indications on manifestation of the @xmath23 mixing in the decays @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite , suggested for studies in ref .  @xcite . in another experiment ,",
    "the besiii collaboration has measured the decays @xmath28 and @xmath29 and observed the resonance structure in the three pion mass spectra in the vicinity of 1.4 gev with the width of about 50 mev @xcite . at the same time , the corresponding @xmath30 and @xmath31 mass spectra in the vicinity of 990 mev ( i.e. in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 threshold domain ) possess the narrow structure with the width about 10 mev @xcite .",
    "so , in this experiment , the isospin breaking decay @xmath34@xmath1@xmath35@xmath1@xmath36 followed by the transition @xmath37@xmath38 was observed for the first time @xcite with the statistical significance exceeding @xmath39 . in the same experiment ,",

    "it should be recalled that the corresponding @xmath48 wave amplitude responsible for the breaking of isotopic invariance , in the region between @xmath12 thresholds ( the width of this region is about 8 mev ) , turns out to be of the order of @xmath49 @xcite , but not @xmath50 , i.e. by the order of magnitude greater than it could be expected from the naive considerations .",

    "the mechanism of the breaking of isotopic invariance in the decay @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath51 is similar to the mechanism of the @xmath52 mixing in that it is caused by the transition @xmath0@xmath1@xmath53@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath51 .",
    "its amplitude does not vanish due to the nonvanishing mass difference of @xmath54 and @xmath55 mesons , and turns out to be appreciable in the narrow region between the @xmath32 and @xmath44 thresholds .",
    "the aim of the present work is the elucidation of the possible mechanism of the decay @xmath56 .",
    "there are attempts in the literature to theoretically explain this decay as being due to the mechanism that includes the logarithmic ( triangle ) singularities @xcite , i.e. , due to the transition @xmath57 .",
    "we pay attention to the fact that in the cited works the vector @xmath58 meson in the intermediate state was considered to be stable , and show that the account of the finite width of @xmath5 , @xmath59 mev , smoothes the logarithmic singularities in the amplitude resulting in the suppression of the calculated width of the decay @xmath60 by the factor of @xmath8 in comparison with the case of @xmath61=0 .",

    "according to besiii @xcite , the mass and width of the @xmath0 peak in the @xmath25 channel are @xmath65 mev and @xmath66 mev , respectively , while the branching ratio is @xmath67 comparing the above with the result of particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , @xmath68one gets @xmath69 the magnitude of this ratio tells us about very large breaking of the isotopic invariance in the decay @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 .",
