    "like a star , a stellar cluster produces heat by contracting .",
    "the positive energy that is released by the more tightly bound core is diffused outward by two - body relaxation @xcite on a relaxation time scale ( equation  [ eq : trh ] , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . just as for a star , the contraction phase in a cluster is only a small fraction of the total lifetime .",
    "@xcite had the insight that the evolution of clusters after core contraction can be understood by assuming that an energy source provides the right amount of energy in a self - regulating fashion to sustain the two - body relaxation process .",
    "a breakthrough in the understanding of cluster evolution , comparable to eddington s work on stellar structure .    in single - mass clusters",
    "the energy is supplied by binary stars @xcite that form in the densest phase of core collapse @xcite .",
    "they provide energy by interacting with other stars , thereby increasing the total ( negative ) energy of the cluster @xcite . in more realistic clusters",
    "mass loss of member stars also increases the total ( negative ) energy . in this contribution",
    "we show that the corresponding energy production rate can come into balance with the flow of energy due to two - body relaxation .",
    "when considering mass loss of stars in a collisional system there are a few time scales that need to be considered : the timescale for massive stars to segregate to the cluster core by dynamical friction , and the lifetime of stars , or main sequence time , @xmath1 .",
    "the former depends on the mass of the star , @xmath2 , the mean stellar mass , @xmath3 and the half - mass relaxation time scale of the cluster , @xmath4 , as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we use the conventional expression for @xmath4 @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the number of stars , @xmath8 is the half - mass radius , @xmath9 is the gravitational constant and @xmath10 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the argument of the coulomb logarithm is @xmath11 for single - mass systems @xcite and @xmath12 for clusters with a wide mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rate is predominantly set by @xmath1 and this timescale depends on the properties of the star , mainly @xmath2 , and not on the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "the two timescales @xmath13 and @xmath1 become comparable for the most massive main sequence star after some period of time .",
    "this is because @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "a star for which @xmath17 reaches the core within its lifetime and will lose its mass there . from that moment",
    "onwards mass loss will proceed on average from the central parts of the cluster .",
    "the amount of energy that is released depends on the mass and specific energy of the star at the moment it loses mass . in   [",
    "sec : demand ] we quantify how much energy a cluster needs to evolve and in   [ sec : supply ] we show how much energy can be generated by mass loss .",
    "let us first consider how much energy is needed per unit of time .",
    "just as for a star , the flow of energy , or luminosity @xmath18 , is determined by the properties of the system as a whole .",
    "it equals a fraction @xmath19 of the instantaneous total energy @xmath20 per unit of @xmath4 @xcite @xmath21 the total energy for a cluster in virial equilibrium may be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , depending on the density profile and @xmath24 is the total mass .",
    "the evolution of the main cluster parameters ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) can be understood once we know how @xmath4 evolves . for this",
    "it is insightful to consider the idealised models of hnon . in the absence of a tidal field",
    "the energy flow leads to a self - similar expansion at a roughly constant mass and @xmath4 grows linearly in time such that @xmath25 @xcite . in a steady tidal field",
    "the radius is limited by the tidal radius and @xmath4 decreases linearly in time @xcite . in both cases @xmath26 ( see the derivation from hnon s work in @xcite and see @xcite for measurements of @xmath19 from numerical simulations ) and @xmath19 can be more than an order of magnitude higher for clusters with a wide mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "we consider clusters that are not strongly confined by a tidal field .",
    "this is justified by the observation that about half of the ( old ) galactic globular clusters are still expanding towards their tidal boundary @xcite .",
    "we then find from equation  ( [ eq : trh ] ) and ( [ eq : edot ] ) that @xmath27 and    @xmath28    this means that the ( absolute value of the ) cluster energy decreases by roughly @xmath29 each age dex during the expansion .",
    "it is in this phase that stellar mass loss can provide the energy .",
    "although a cluster only loses about half of its initial mass due to stellar mass loss over a hubble time , this modest mass - loss rate in fact generates energy at a rate comparable to what is required ( equation  [ eq : edott ] ) , as we will show in   [ sec : supply ] .",
    "as we aim to show in this section , the rate of energy increase as a result of mass loss of stars , @xmath30 , leads to a power - law decline of @xmath31 ( equation  [ eq : edott ] ) .",
    "this is primarily because the evolution of the total mass as a result of stellar evolution from a stellar system with a salpeter like stellar initial mass function , declines roughly as a power of time @xmath32 , with @xmath33 ( this corresponds to a loss of about 15% of the mass every age dex , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the instantaneous mass - loss rate is thus @xmath34    to relate this to energy we need to know from where and how fast mass is lost .",
    "we assume that the mass - loss time scale is much longer than the local crossing time , such that the cluster responds adiabatically and retains virial equilibrium .",
    "@xcite discussed the adiabatic response of a gravitational system if mass is lost homologous with the density profile of the cluster , that is , without a preferred location .",
    "the cluster radius then increases as @xmath35 and the change in energy relates to the change in mass as ( equation  [ eq : e ] )      when @xmath37 mass loss happens predominantly from the core of the cluster , because the most massive stars , i.e. the ones contributing most to the total stellar mass loss , are centrally concentrated because of dynamical friction .",
    "mass loss affects both the potential energy @xmath38 and the kinetic energy @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mean - square velocity of the system .",
    "this is because the mass that is removed carries away a bit of potential and kinetic energy and because of the subsequent redistribution of potential and kinetic energy of the remaining stars .",
    "we can express the change in the potential energy in terms of the specific potential of the mass that is lost , @xmath41 , relative to the average specific potential of all the stars , @xmath42 , as @xmath43 .",
    "for the kinetic term we need to compare the squared velocity of the mass that is lost , @xmath44 , to the mean square velocity of the cluster : @xmath45 . using our assumption that the remaining stars quickly restore virial equilibrium ( @xmath46 ) we can relate the change in the total energy to the change in mass          from a comparison to the energy ` demand ' ( equation  [ eq : edott ] ) we see that _ a balance between energy supply and demand is reached if @xmath52 . _ because @xmath33 the condition for energy generation by stellar mass loss to be in balance by two - body relaxation becomes @xmath53 . to answer the question whether this value is realistic",
    ", we need to consider a cluster potential that described a cluster in the balanced evolution phase .",
    "one example is the @xcite model , which has the required @xmath54 density cusp . from the potential of this model we find @xmath55 .",
    "if we ignore the small contribution of the kinetic term to @xmath56 in equation ( [ eq : exm ] ) we find that @xmath53 if mass loss takes place at @xmath57 .",
    "this is probably realistic in the case of a mass segregated system .",
    "this shows that the product @xmath58 can be of sufficient magnitude ( about @xmath59 , equation  [ eq : edott ] ) to drive the relaxation process . in a forthcoming paper ( gieles , heggie & church )",
    "we will illustrate this result with numerical simulations and show that stellar mass loss is indeed a viable energy source in driving the dynamical expansion of star clusters .",
    "mg thanks douglas heggie for many interesting discussions on this topic and the staff of the sterrekundig instituut utrecht for their inspiration and support during the 10 years he spent there as an undergraduate and phd student ."
