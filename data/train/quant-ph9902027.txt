    "in ref . @xmath0 $ ] , the author et al . have shown that simon s algorithm@xmath1 } $ ] higher than classical efficiency comes from non - mechanism .",
    "this is a global feature of the evolution of a quantum system undergoing wave function collapse ( a revamped notion ) .",
    "this evolution is driven by _ both _ the initial actions performed on the quantum system and a final constraint imposed by the action of performing a measurement on it . }",
    "the state produced by the initial actions should not satisfy that constraint : in other words , having wave function collapse is essential .",
    "the capability of driving the evolution of a quantum system by means of both initial and final actions is leveraged in quantum computation , to obtain in fact higher than classical efficiency . in simon s algorithm",
    ", it can be said that quantum measurement analogically sets a constraint on the output of a hard - to - reverse boolean network and , at once , solves such a constrained network .",
    "this takes the time required to solve the _ unconstrained _ network in all possible ways ( in a quantum superposition thereof ) ",
    "namely a time polynomial in network size .",
    "the problem of solving the constrained network would otherwise be np .",
    "this originates higher than classical efficiency .    also the efficiency of shor s algorithm@xmath2 }",
    "$ ] is likely to have a non - mechanistic origin , as this algorithm is tightly related to simon s  to the problem of finding the period of a hard - to - reverse function ( finding the arguments given the value of the function is hard ) .    on the contrary , quantum algorithms which solve oracle problems",
    "reach the solution in a deterministic way , and no wave function collapse is involved .",
    "apparently , this leaves no room to non - mechanism .",
    "however , as they are , these algorithms do not capture all the relevant aspects of the problem .",
    "part of the problem description is not represented inside the quantum algorithm .",
    "this can readily be corrected by introducing a small change in the algorithm .",
    "the character of the altered algorithm is clearly non - mechanistic .",
    "this will be shown by working on the algorithms devised by deutsch@xmath3 } $ ] , deutsch and jozsa@xmath4 } , $ ] and grover@xmath5 } $ ] .",
    "for our purposes , it is important to keep in mind that an oracle problem is a competition between two parties .",
    "sticking on greek tradition , let us call the examiner `` sphinx '' and the examinee `` oedipus '' .",
    "their challenge is mathematically characterized as follows .    in the first place , we need to characterize the oracle .",
    "since a computer program establishes an input - output function , we will speak indifferently of programs or functions .",
    "given @xmath6 , let @xmath7 be the @xmath8-th element of some set of functions @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ( the latter is the number of all possible functions from @xmath11to @xmath12 ) .",
    "we say that the @xmath8-th mode of the oracle is a computer - and - program ( a `` gate '' ) @xmath13 that , given any input @xmath14 , yields the output @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , @xmath8 is an identification number of the software program installed on the computer .",
    "once prepared the oracle in its @xmath8-th mode , the sphinx gives it to oedipus .",
    "he knows all the programs in @xmath16 , but knows nothing about the choice of the sphinx .",
    "he is free to run the computer and forbidden to inspect the mode .",
    "his problem is to identify @xmath8 ( or a property thereof ) in the most efficient way with some desired probability that such an identification is correct , but this generalization will not be needed . ] .    in quantum oracle computing ,",
    "the computer becomes quantum , while its mode @xmath8 remains sharp ( classical ) .",
    "this formulation can not fit the notion of non - mechanism .",
    "this is a global property of a quantum evolution comprising an initial measurement ( required to prepare the quantum system in a known state ) , a unitary evolution and a final measurement inducing a wave function collapse that can actively drive the evolution toward the solution of a problem ( see ref .",
    "such an evolution should both _ describe _ and _ solve _ the problem .",
    "for example , in simon s and shor s algorithms , all knowledge and ignorance about the period of a function @xmath17 defined over @xmath18 , is represented in the superposition @xmath19 . on the contrary ,",
    "oedipus knowledge about @xmath16 and ignorance about @xmath8 is not represented inside the current algorithms .",
    "however , this can readily be adjusted by introducing a simple change in the quantum gate .",
    "1-a and 1-b show the usual and the altered gate ",
    "gates are represented in the standard form given in ref.[6 ] .",
    "the altered gate is equipped with an ancillary input @xmath8 and computes the function @xmath20 such that , for all @xmath8 , @xmath21 .",
    "oedipus knowledge about @xmath16 and ignorance about @xmath8 are represented by the result of computing @xmath22 , with @xmath23 prepared in the even superposition @xmath24 and the ancilla @xmath8 prepared in the even superposition @xmath25 .",
    "1-b shows the gate @xmath22 with the ancilla already prepared in that superposition , @xmath26 denotes the hadamard transform .",
    "oedipus must be forbidden to measure the ancilla , at least after the hadamard transform has been performed on it , and before solving the problem .",
    "let us call `` gate '' the box computing @xmath27 , or @xmath22 ; all gate inputs but @xmath28 go unchanged into the corresponding outputs , while @xmath28 goes into @xmath29 , or @xmath30 , where the sign @xmath31 denotes module 2 addition .",
    "let us consider the modified version of deutsch s 1985 algorithm@xmath32 } $ ] given in ref .",
    "@xmath33 .$ ] @xmath16 is the set of all possible functions @xmath34    cc + @xmath23 & @xmath35 + @xmath36 & @xmath36 + @xmath37 & @xmath36    cc + @xmath23 & @xmath35 + @xmath36 & @xmath36 + @xmath37 & @xmath37    cc + @xmath23 & @xmath35 + @xmath36 & @xmath37 + @xmath37 & @xmath36    cc + @xmath23 & @xmath35 + @xmath36 & @xmath37 + @xmath37 & @xmath37    this set is divided into a couple of subsets : the balanced functions , characterized by an even number of zeroes and ones and identified by @xmath38 and the unbalanced ones , which here are the constant functions , and are identified by @xmath39 .",
    "oedipus problem is to find whether @xmath7 ( randomly chosen by the sphinx ) is balanced or not , in the most efficient way .",
    "deutsch s algorithm , in one run ( against two in classical computation ) , deterministically yields either @xmath40 if the mode is balanced , or @xmath41 if the mode is unbalanced . quantum measurement in the basis @xmath42 does not induce any wave function collapse , it just serves to read @xmath23 : non - mechanism remains , so to speak , hidden .",
    "i shall now port deutsch s algorithm to the altered gate @xmath43 ( see fig .",
    "2 , where an @xmath26 gate always denotes a hadamard transform ) .",
    "the function computed by gate @xmath43 is :    [ cols=\"^,^,^ , < \" , ]     at this point , we need to revise the terms of the competition between the sphinx and oedipus .",
    "the following protocol leaves the substance of the problem unchanged , while adapting the problem to the algorithm given in fig .",
    "oedipus receives the box @xmath22 with @xmath8 prepared in the superposition of all modes .",
    "thus , for the time being , even the sphinx does not know which is the mode .",
    "oedipus problem is still finding whether the mode is balanced or unbalanced in the most efficient way ( without accessing @xmath44 ) .",
    "_ after _ that oedipus has given the solution , the sphinx measures register @xmath8 , thus finding the mode ; then it can check whether oedipus answer was right .",
    "of course oedipus indirectly  through entanglement  affects register @xmath8 .",
    "things will become clearer when the protocol is applied .    as readily checked , the output of the unitary propagation described in fig .",
    "2 is , before measurement :    @xmath45    measurement of the one - qubit register @xmath23 induces a wave function collapse in both registers @xmath23 and @xmath8 producing , say at time @xmath46 either the outcome @xmath47 or the outcome @xmath48 in the former ( latter ) case , register @xmath8 has collapsed on an even superposition of the balanced ( unbalanced ) modes .",
    "let us call @xmath49 the overall registers state after that register @xmath23 has been measured .",
    "this state is originated in a non - mechanistic way , being shaped by both the initial actions , leading to @xmath50 , and the final constraint that measurement yields a single value of @xmath23 , which of course means a specific value , either 1 or 0 in a mutually exclusive way :    @xmath51    see also ref.[1 ] .",
    "clearly @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) selects an even superposition of balanced ( unbalanced ) modes , see eq .",
    "say that measurement of register @xmath23 yields @xmath37 :",
    "oedipus declares that the mode is balanced .",
    "then the sphinx measures register @xmath8 , finding either @xmath54 or @xmath55  see eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "since either mode is balanced , the sphinx checks that oedipus answer was right .",
    "quantum efficiency ( one run against two in classical computation ) comes from the fact that measurement of register @xmath23 at once _ yields _ a value of @xmath23 and _ creates _ , in the ancillary register @xmath8 , an even superposition of either balanced or unbalanced modes  depending on @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly , by backdating the outcome @xmath56 of register @xmath8 collapses [ ref.1,9,10 ] immediately after performing the hadamard transform on the ancilla , @xmath56 can be seen as the outcome of a random choice performed by the sphinx .",
    "we can see that , _ after all _ ( in a literal sense ) , the new protocol leaves the original problem unaltered .",
    "state ( 1 ) shows another reason for adopting the altered algorithm .",
    "it clearly gives the characteristic function of the balanced modes and therefore represents all the knowledge we need to say that @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) means balanced ( unbalanced ) . on the contrary , if we started with a sharp value of @xmath8 , the knowledge that @xmath23 is such a characteristic function would necessarily dwell in oedipus head ; it would not be physically represented .",
    "it is reasonable to think that , when dealing with quantum - physical computation , all the knowledge about the object of the computation should be represented in a physical way .",
    "it should be evident that the foregoing considerations can be applied to the `` second '' seminal quantum oracle problem , namely deutsch - jozsa algorithm@xmath59 } $ ] . here",
    "@xmath60 is the set of all the balanced and constant functions from @xmath11to @xmath12 . chosen a function at random , the problem is to efficiently find whether the quantum computer computes a balanced or a constant function . by altering the algorithm exactly as before",
    ", the non - mechanistic nature of the solution process becomes manifest .",
    "we shall now consider grover s algorithm@xmath5 } $ ] .",
    "given the @xmath61 functions @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , and chosen one function @xmath7 at random , oedipus problem is to find @xmath8 in the most efficient way , by checking the input - output behaviour of a quantum computer .",
    "we shall consider the simplest case of @xmath64 , so that @xmath8 ranges over @xmath65 in the usual algorithm , @xmath8 is found in a deterministic way with one run of grover s loop . as usual , we substitute @xmath27 with @xmath66 for all @xmath8 ; the two ancillary qubits required to specify @xmath8 are prepared in an even superposition of all possible modes ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    without entering into detail ,",
    "the output of just one iteration of grover s loop is :    @xmath67    measuring @xmath68 and @xmath69 , at once ( non - mechanistically , as before ) _ creates _ the mode @xmath8 in register @xmath8 and yields the value of @xmath70 in register @xmath23 .",
    "backdating register @xmath8 collapse immediately after performing the hadarmard transform on it , yields the random choice originally performed by the sphinx .",
    "in ref.[1 ] we have given a demonstration that the higher than classical efficiency of simon s and related algorithms comes from quantum non - mechanism .",
    "this demonstration has been extended in this work to quantum oracle problem solving . in conclusion",
    ", the special efficiency of all known quantum algorithms would have a non - mechanistic origin .",
    "non - mechanism hinges on the notion of wave function collapse , an exclusively quantum feature that allows to drive the evolution of a quantum system by acting on both initial and final conditions .",
    "it is hoped that the results obtained will revamp the notion of collapse .",
    "it seems difficult to understand the motivation of getting rid of the notion of something that yields effective benefits .    perhaps quantum computation , because of its unique feature of joining a fundamental character and a capability of describing complex states of affairs , can yield fresh insights for the interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this work has brought in a seemingly interesting side - effect . in order to show the non - mechanistic character of quantum oracle problem solving , a _ state of knowledge _ of the problem solver ( oedipus uncertainty about the value of @xmath8 )",
    "had to be translated into a physical description , and this description had to be _ strictly quantum _ in order to match reality ."
