    "modification of einstein s general theory of relativity is required to explain the late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "there are two methods for explaining these new observations , one method is to introduce the concept of dark energy to provide the necessary force for acceleration and the other method is to modify einstein s equation of general theory of relativity(gtr ) .",
    "f(r ) model gravity is an attempt to modify gtr @xcite , for a review see reference [ 4]@xcite .",
    "there exist black hole solutions in this new formulation of gravity also@xcite .    [ [ section ] ]    there are a number of modified gravity theories and f(r ) theory is the simplest one . in einstein s formulation",
    "the ricci scalar is used as the lagrangian density . in f(r ) theory , we use a general function of ricci scalar as the lagrangian density . due to the appearance of the function of the ricci",
    "scalar the resulting field equation is fourth order , while the field equation in einstein s general relativity is second order .",
    "this makes the study of f(r ) field equation more difficult but attempts have been made to obtain cosmological solution and black hole solution in this new frame work .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    black holes are objects capable of absorbing all particles and radiation that enter the event horizon . but in 1970s bekenstein@xcite and hawking@xcite developed the black hole thermodynamics which indicates that black holes have a characteristic temperature and entropy .",
    "semi - classical theory shows that black holes can emit particles@xcite .",
    "this is called particle creation by black holes .",
    "these studies led to a new area of study called thermodynamics of black holes and this area has attracted attention of many .",
    "classically all matter entering the event horizon get absorbed by the black hole .",
    "but quantum mechanically there is a probability of matter and/or fields getting scattered .",
    "this shows a non - zero reflectivity at the horizon . using this assumption a number of works",
    "have appeared in the literature studying black hole scattering@xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the basic theory of black hole scattering assuming that black hole is surrounded by a scalar field which obeys the klein - gordon equation . in section 3",
    "we study the the wave function of scattering field in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "the solution of wave equation in a region @xmath0 greater than @xmath1 is studied in the section 4 . in section 5 the solution at far away from horizon",

    "we calculate the hawking temperature via tunneling method .",
    "conclusion of the present study is given in section 8 .",
    "the action for the gravity in f(r ) theory can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the determinant of the metric and @xmath4 is a general function of the ricci scalar @xmath5 .",
    "we start with a static spherically symmetric solution of the form @xcite @xmath6 following reference.[11 ] , we assume that @xmath7 is constant and @xmath8 we get a solution of the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 equal to , @xmath11 the @xmath12 term in the solution represents a cosmological constant term . assuming the cosmological constant term is zero ie . @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we get ,    @xmath15    where all the symbols except @xmath16 have the usual meaning .",

    "we now place the black hole immersed in a massive scalar field , the field equation in this back ground can be described by the klein - gordon equation@xcite    @xmath26    in curved space - time this equation can be written in the following form ,",

    "( 24 ) the wave function in the vicinity of the black hole horizon can be written , assuming the field gets reflected at the black hole horizon , as @xmath50 where @xmath5 represents the reflection coefficient .",
    "if @xmath51 , there is a definite probability for the incident wave to get reflected at the horizon .",
    "in this section we consider a situation where the field is sufficiently away from the event horizon .",
    "we also assume a situation that the energy and momentum , @xmath31 and @xmath52 of the field are very small and they can be neglected . for s - wave eq .",
    "( 14 ) now takes the form , @xmath53 from which we obtain , after some calculations , the following equation    @xmath54    and the wave function is obtained as , @xmath55 comparing the solutions for regions 1 and 2 , we have in region 1 the wave function as @xmath56 which contains both incoming and outgoing waves . for @xmath57-wave , we can rewrite the solution for region 1 , as @xmath58 where r is the reflection coefficient@xcite .",
    "this can be further simplified as @xmath59 thus in region 2 also , we can write the @xmath57 - wave solution as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in the next section we will study the behaviour scalar field in a region sufficiently far away from the horizon .",
    "in this region , the radial part of the wave equation can be written as @xmath63 with p is the linear momentum associated with scalar field and is @xmath64 .    using frobenius method",
    "we can solve the above equation .",
    "the solution is given by    @xmath65    with @xmath66 this can be again simplified as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . at the boundary between region 2 and region 3 , where @xmath70 then we can expand both sine and cosine terms and need to take only first terms ; then @xmath71 and @xmath72 and the @xmath57 - wave solution is given by , @xmath73    and in region 2 , @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 from region 1 we get the wave function finally as @xmath76 comparing equations ( 36 ) and ( 37 ) we can obtain @xmath77 and @xmath78 as @xmath79 .",
    "now we will calculate the absorption coefficient , assuming the wave gets reflected at the horizon .",
    "the absorption cross section can be evaluated using the above data .",
    "we now consider the solution of eq.(32 ) given by eq.(33 ) .",
    "the scattering matrix element is defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the phase shift corresponding to angular momentum @xmath32 .",
    "we take the low energy limit so that @xmath82 . using eqs .",
    "( 33 ) , ( 35 ) and ( 37 ) , we can obtain , for @xmath57 - waves , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . substituting the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "we get @xmath85 as @xmath86 defining @xmath87 the equation of @xmath85 takes the form @xmath88 the absorption cross section @xmath89 , is then given by @xmath90 using the above equations and also using the relation @xmath91 we obtain finally @xmath92 since @xmath1 is inversely proportional to the hawking temperature @xmath93 , we can see that absorption cross section is inversely related to hawking temperature .",
    "now we will determine the hawking temperature using tunneling mechanism@xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been used by many authors@xcite for determining the hawking radiation of black holes in einstein gravity . even though the complete properties of hawking radiation can be obtained using quantum field theory in curved space - time",
    ", the tunneling mechanism gives a simple understandable picture . according to this picture the radiation arises by a process similar to electron - positron pair creation in a constant electric field . using tunneling picture of black hole radiation we can have a direct semi - classical derivation of black hole radiation .",
    "there are two different schemes in tunneling approach , first is the radial null geodesic method and the other is hamilton - jacobi method . here",
    "we use the radial null geodesic method .",
    "the metric in eq.(5 ) can be transformed in to painleve@xcite like coordinate system to remove the singularity in the original extended metric as , @xmath94 the radial null geodesics are @xmath95 the typical wavelength of the radiation is of the order of the size of the black hole and hence when the outgoing wave is traced back towards the horizon its wavelength as measured by local observers , is blue shifted . near the horizon ,",
    "radial wave number approachs to infinity and we can use wkb approximation to study for the particle tunneling .",
    "we start with original action @xmath96 using hamilton s equation of motion @xmath97 we can write the imaginary part of the action as @xmath98    using eq.(45 ) , the imaginary part of the action s can be written as    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the frequency of out going particle .",
    "eq.(48 ) can be integrated to obtain @xmath101 since @xmath33 is much greater than @xmath100 we can apply the binomial expansion to get @xmath102 now the semi - classical emission rate can be written as @xmath103 from which we get @xmath104 there exist higher order corrections of @xmath100 due to the conservation of energy , but for the first order calculation it is neglected .",
    "it is possible to find out the frequency dependent transmission coefficient or graybody factors in this tunneling scenario .",
    "in this paper we have studied the scattering properties of extended black holes in f(r ) theory .",
    "we have obtained the scattered wave equation in both regions near the horizon and away from horizon . using the scattering method we have obtained the absorption cross section and also calculated the hawking temperature of the black hole via tunneling method .",
