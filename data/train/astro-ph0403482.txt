    "in this paper we present the discovery of a particularly rare type of emission line star made in the initial phase of a long - term spectroscopy programme which aims to confirm and provide preliminary classification of spatially - unresolved line - excess objects contained within the aao / uk schmidt southern galactic plane h@xmath0 survey ( parker et al 2003 ) .",
    "the star in question has been revealed as only the fourth massive wo star to be found in the galaxy  bringing the total identified within the local group to just seven .",
    "when it is assimilated into the next revision of the catalogue of massive wolf - rayet stars in the galaxy , compiled and maintained by van der hucht ( 2001 ) , its position in the sky will earn it the designation wr 93b .",
    "hereafter we refer to this newly discovered star by this name .",
    "the wo stars are the most chemically extreme wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , whose spectra are dominated by high - excitation oxygen and carbon lines .",
    "objects in this elite group of stars are viewed as plausible progenitors for extreme , chemically - peculiar type ib / c supernovae ( woosley , heger & weaver 2002 ) and some grbs ( e.g. schaefer et al 2003 ) .",
    "the history of this presently rare type of object begins with the last generation of galactic emission line surveys : sanduleak ( 1971 ) presented a list of five wr stars , two in the magellanic clouds , which had strong o  vi 3811,34    emission features that had previously been found only amongst planetary nebula nuclei .",
    "barlow & hummer ( 1982 ) proposed that one of these five stars was indeed a pn central star but that the other four corresponded to an advanced stage of evolution of massive stars , beyond the wc phase , and classified them as wo wolf - rayet stars . since this time",
    ", two more have been added to this grouping ( ms 4 , by smith , shara & moffat 1990 and dr  1 in the dwarf irregular galaxy ic 1613 by kingsburgh & barlow 1995 ) . in general terms ,",
    "discoveries of galactic wr stars have been assisted greatly by optical objective - prism surveys ( stephenson & sanduleak 1971 , macconnell & sanduleak 1970 ) and narrow - band imaging surveys ( most recently , shara et al .",
    "the result we present here uses the latter technique in the red part of the spectrum , and serves as an encouragement that much remains to be discovered .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the aao / uk schmidt southern galactic plane h@xmath0 survey and describe the data it contains relevant to the newly - discovered wo star and its locale .",
    "we then describe how the wo star came to be included in our initial programme of follow - up spectroscopy using the aao / uk schmidt multi - fibre spectroscopy facility , 6df .",
    "this is followed , in section 3 , by presentation of both the 6df data obtained in may / june 2003 (  3.1 ) , and flux - calibrated long - slit spectra obtained at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) in august 2003 (  3.2 ) .",
    "we are then in a position to classify the wo star and determine its reddening (  4 ) .",
    "we also present estimates of c / he and o / he abundance ratios deduced from the emission lines (  5 ) .",
    "finally , by comparison with other wo stars at known distances , we derive the distance to wr  93b (  6 ) : at 3.4  kpc , and along a line of sight passing within a few degrees of the galactic centre , it seems likely the new wo star is associated with the scutum - crux spiral arm ( russeil 2003 )  without a doubt it is well inside the solar circle .",
    "we close in  7 with comment on the 4-strong group of galactic wo stars and on the prospects for future discoveries .",
    "( 0,200 ) ( 0,0 )    the aao / ukst narrow - band h@xmath0 survey of the southern galactic plane and magellanic clouds is the last photographic sky survey to have been carried out on the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) .",
    "it has recently been completed ( parker et al .",
    "2003 ) and is now available as digital survey data derived from supercosmos scans of the original survey films at 10  @xmath7 m ( 0.67 arcsec ) resolution ( hereafter , the shs database , located at http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/halpha/ ) .",
    "this survey used a specially designed , 70    bandpass , h@xmath0 interference filter ( parker & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) .",
    "when combined with fine - grained tech - pan emulsion as detector ( parker and malin , 1999 ) , it made possible a survey of galactic ionised hydrogen that is a powerful combination of depth , spatial resolution and areal coverage ( parker & phillipps , 1998 ) .",
    "each field observed has an effective dimension projected on the sky of @xmath8 .",
    "the survey policy was to gather contemporaneous 15-minute broad - band ` short @xmath9 ' exposures alongside 3-hour narrow - band h@xmath0 exposures in order to yield exposure pairs , well matched both in terms of sensitivity limit ( @xmath10 ) for continuum point sources and in terms of point - spread functions .",
    "the entire southern plane of the milky way has been imaged within the galactic latitude range @xmath11 in this way .",
    "these exposure pairs provide the source material for a variety of continuing research projects ( see e.g. morgan , parker & russeil 2001 ; parker & morgan 2003 ; parker et al 2003 ) .",
    "we have embarked on a programme aimed at providing spectroscopic confirmations of spatially - unresolved candidate emission line stars derived from the shs database .",
    "this began in 2003 with limited data - taking using the ukst 6df facility to follow up a few fields in the brighter half of the available magnitude range ( @xmath12 ) , with a view to establishing observing procedures for the longer term .",
    "the broad goal of the programme is to increase by an order of magnitude galactic samples of the relatively short - lived , rare phases of stellar evolution typified by strong line emission at h@xmath0 .",
    "this is expected to be achieved by dropping the current typical limit of @xmath13 on survey samples of emission line stars ( cf .",
    "macconnell 1982 , robertson & jordan 1989 ) down to @xmath14 .",
    "the value in this is that several groups of young and evolved objects , critical to our understanding of pre- and post - main - sequence stellar evolution , are currently extremely poorly sampled : as noted already , the massive wo star reported here is only the fourth to be found in the milky way .    as part of our initial spectroscopy programme , we chose to observe targets drawn from field hal0555 within the magnitude range @xmath15 .",
    "centred at 17h 20 m @xmath16 ( 1950 co - ordinates ) , this field is a highly reddened one straddling the galactic equator , just a few degrees in longitude away from the galactic centre .",
    "106 point sources were selected for spectroscopy from a longer list of candidate stars with relatively extreme h@xmath0 magnitude excesses with respect to the associated short - red broadband magnitudes ( @xmath17 , with the great majority of stars falling in the range @xmath18 ) .",
    "note that the shs h@xmath0 magnitudes are derived from calibration of the h@xmath0 images against @xmath9 standards , and undergo final adjustments as a function of @xmath9 magnitude such that the median @xmath19 colour for any given field is set to zero ( cf .",
    "the discussion of calibration of the supercosmos sky survey presented in hambly et al 2001 ) .",
    "the plan for the spectroscopy , in the long term , is to also select on @xmath20 in order to reduce the number of unwanted red stars whose molecular band structure mimics h@xmath0 excess .",
    "however this was not done here so that we might determine empirically how best to apply such a cut .",
    "one of the sources selected for spectroscopy was located in the dark ne part of the field at ra  17 32 03.30 , dec  @xmath21 04 32.5 ( j2000 ) and was listed in the shs database as having @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( see hambly et al 2001 for a discussion of likely photographic errors ) .",
    "the suitability of this object for follow - up spectroscopy becomes apparent on considering its position in a magnitude - limited plot of point - source @xmath24 colour versus @xmath19 excess for objects in its immediate locality . in figure  [ f_cc ]",
    "we present such a plot for all stars within 15  arcmin of the wo star : it can be seen there that it is one of just two objects sitting in relative isolation , on the ` excess ' side of a well - populated locus of stars .",
    "the other clear excess object star still awaits spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , > , < , < \" , ]     adopting a distance of 49  kpc to the lmc ( see e.g.gibson 2000 ) , the difference of 5.7 magnitudes with respect to sand  2 yields a distance of 3.5  kpc to wr  93b .",
    "two recent estimates of the distance to be  87 , the cluster hosting sand  5 , are respectively 1.6  kpc ( massey , degioia - eastwood & waterhouse 2001 ) and 1.9  kpc ( kndlseder et al 2002 ) : we adopt the intermediate value of 1.75  kpc .",
    "the nir magnitude difference of @xmath251.43 , combined with this distance then yields a distance to wr  93b of 3.4  kpc .",
    "this is very satisfying agreement .",
    "but , given the systematic uncertainty contained within the assumption of shared stellar parameters , we should anticipate an error on 3.4  kpc of up to 10 % ( equivalent to @xmath260.2 offset in @xmath27 ) .    the galactic co - ordinates of wr  93b are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , placing it less than 7from the galactic centre line of sight , and outside the strips surveyed for wolf - rayet stars by shara et al ( 1999 ) . at a distance of 3.4",
    "kpc the new wo star would be located very close to the structure russeil ( 2003 ) identifies as the scutum - crux arm , well inside the long - established sagittarius - carina arm at @xmath262  kpc in the same direction . for a necessarily young object like a wolf - rayet star",
    "this is a perfectly acceptable place to be .",
    "projected onto the plane of the sky , the nearest h  ii region ( a signature of continuing star formation ) listed by russeil ( 2003 , table 3 ) is about half a degree away from wr  93b at @xmath30 , @xmath31 . at 3.4  kpc",
    "this angular separation converts to a length of about 30  pc .",
    "the kinematic distance to this hii region , which is ` compact ' and without a known optical counterpart , has been estimated from caswell & haynes ( 1987 ) measurement of its radio recombination line radial velocity . in the framework",
    "adopted by russeil ( 2003 ) , wherein the galactic centre is 8.5  kpc away , the distance to this h  ii region is required to be @xmath32 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with our estimate of the distance to the wo star .",
    "if the galactic centre is taken to be 7.94@xmath330.42  kpc as determined recently by eisenhauer et al ( 2003 ) , this revises the kinematic distance downwards a little to 3.3  kpc  leaving the quality of agreement unchanged .",
    "with the addition of this newly - revealed wo star , the elite club of known galactic wo stars has increased its membership to four .",
    "we consider briefly how these stars are distributed within the disk of the milky way . in table",
    "[ t_wostars ] we list the galactic co - ordinates and estimated distances of all 4 stars and use these data to calculate their galacto - centric distances .",
    "the distance from the sun to ms 4 ( wr 30a ) is adopted from van der hucht ( 2001 ) , which in turn is based on the absolute calibration of o stars due to vacca , garmany & shull ( 1996 ) .",
    "the distance to sand  4 ( wo2 , also known as wr 102 ) is particularly uncertain , with literature estimates ranging from 2.3  kpc ( kingsburgh et al 1995 ) up to 5.6  kpc ( van der hucht 2001 ) .",
    "here we have derived and use a value of 4.6  kpc on the basis of the same ir photometric scaling relative to sand 5 ( also wo2 ) that we have used to determine the distance to wr  93b .",
    "this object joins wr  93b in lying far inside the solar circle , whilst the other two wo stars , sand  5 ( wr 142 ) and ms 4 lie at galactocentric radii similar to that of the sun .",
    "the existence of this small grouping , taken on its own , would not encourage the idea that evolution to a longer - lived wo stage is favoured in regions of reduced metallicity ( maeder 1991 ) .",
    "nevertheless it is a fact that the three wo stars located in other galaxies are all found in low metallicity environments ( the lmc , smc and ic  1613 ) , as predicted by stellar evolutionary models such as those of maeder ( 1991 ) .",
    "if theory is qualitatively correct , the conclusion must be that a milky way wo star population at large galactocentric radii may still be waiting to be discovered .",
    "this remains a distinct possibility because the northern galactic plane , which includes the anti - centre region has not yet been surveyed systematically for wolf - rayet stars of any sub - type .",
    "by contrast the southern plane has been better served , both by the stephenson & sanduleak ( 1971 ) objective prism survey and , most recently , by shara et al ( 1999 )  and of course by the aao / ukst h@xmath0 survey exploited here .",
    "an alternative phenomenological view of this still modest galactic wo star population is that , as higher excitation , extreme examples of early wc stars ( see e.g. crowther et al 1998 ) , they should follow a similar trend with respect to galactocentric radius to that exhibited by their less elusive relations . if it should turn out that the wo stars are more frequent inside the solar circle than outside it , this would amount to the same trend as is now recognised for wc stars by e.g. massey & johnson ( 1998 ) and shara et al ( 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we have reported the bare facts on a new massive galactic wo3 star ( the only example of its sub - type in the milky way  they are so few ) .",
    "our quantitative findings are summarised in table  [ t_summary ] .",
    "it seems that this is a star with a record - holding stellar wind : no other wind from a non - degenerate star in the galaxy is seen to attain so high a terminal velocity ( 5750 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is also the most highly reddened wo star discovered so far , with @xmath34 .",
    "last we note that wr  93b is remarkable also with regard to its carbon abundance relative to helium : no other known wolf - rayet star can match c / he = 0.95 by number . among the wo stars , only sand  1 in the smc approaches such an extreme ratio with c / he = 0.81 ( kbs95 ) .",
    "but there the similarity ends in that , in sand  1 , o / he is also significantly enhanced relative to the other wo stars ( o / he = 0.3 , as compared with @xmath260.1 ) , while it is not in wr  93b . as is often the case in the presence of such a sparse sample of objects , the emergent picture from  in this instance  the known abundance patterns is too poorly formed to allow any astrophysical conclusions to be drawn .",
    "the clear need is to find more of them .",
    "we end on the optimistic note , that relative to the power of today s spectroscopic capabilities , wr 93  b at @xmath35 is a bright object : appropriate spectroscopic surveys of the galactic plane are bound to find more .",
    "we would like to thank nigel hambly for valuable help on many occasions in connection with the exploitation of the shs database .",
    "mp and rw both acknowledge the support of postgraduate studentships funded by the particle physics & astronomy research council of the united kingdom .",
    "this paper makes use of : data obtained with the aao / uk schmidt telescope at siding spring observatory , nsw , australia ; data from the william herschel telescope , operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias ; data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
