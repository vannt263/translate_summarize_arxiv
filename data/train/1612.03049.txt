    "although the history of the semiconductor devices is long and complicated , the electron charge injection plays the essential and main rule in the field . by miniaturization of the devices , not only the power consumption and manufacturing expenses increase but also the repeatability of manufacturing process would be very difficult @xcite . in consequence , spin degree of freedom ( dof ) has been considered as main parameter in device design . in comparison with the charge - based devices , the higher data processing speed and its non - volatility , lower power consumption and higher integration densities are the main competencies of spin based devices @xcite .",
    "of course , the working temperature , the rate of spin injection and prefect spin polarization are the main bottlenecks of the spin - based components @xcite .",

    "the valence and conduction bands become close to each other at @xmath1 and @xmath2 points , the two in - equivalent corners of the hexagonal brillion zone .",
    "the low - energy electron or hole near the points can be described by the dirac equation . in consequence",
    ", the dirac - cone - like band structure forms in the vicinities of the points , called @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys ( dirac points ) . in other words , an electron or hole near the dirac points possesses two more degrees of freedom called pseudospin or valley dof @xcite .",

    "we show that the time reversal symmetry is broken by applying an external magnetic field . with this condition ,",
    "the valley polarization is small .",
    "but , by applying an exchanged field of 0.13 ev , a valley polarization equal to 46% is achieved .",
    "since only the spin - down electrons take part in the polarized current , the valley polarization can be detected by detecting the spin degrees of freedom .",

    "below , we consider three different cases , which are the hamiltonian without the effects of the magnetic and the exchange fields , with the magnetic field and without the exchange field and finally , including the effect of exchange field and without the magnetic field .",
    "the massive dirac hamiltonian in two - dimensional materials ( eqs .  [ eq:2bandh ] and [ eq : effectiveh ] ) implies the existence of energy band gap in @xmath41 @xcite .",

    "as the figure shows , the pure valley coductance ( defined by @xmath60 ) is not significant despite the high value of the magnetic field .",

    "one question which can be asked is whether we can achieve a perfect valley polarization in the current by manipulating and external voltage gate .",
