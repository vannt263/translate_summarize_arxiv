    "characterising the influence of the environment on the transfer of charge and energy in an open quantum system is a problem of significant current interest .",
    "@xcite in particular , resonant ( or near resonant ) interactions between environmental degrees of freedom and those inherent to the system are thought to play an important role in numerous physical processes .",
    "@xcite however , a comprehensive picture of such dynamics is only beginning to emerge due to the complexity of the systems in question . here , by focusing on a proposed model for olfaction as a vibrationally - activated molecular switch , we explore the detailed effects of the environment on the dynamics of electron transfer ( et ) in an open quantum system , aiming to gain physical insight into vibrationally - assisted transport processes more generally .",
    "in fact , obtaining a deeper understanding of olfaction , the mechanism for which is still being actively debated , @xcite is an important problem in its own right for both fundamental science and industry .",
    "@xcite the prevailing theory , known as the lock - and - key model , explains how the odorant size and shape can provide discrimination in the receptor .",
    "@xcite however , this theory does not give a straightforward explanation of why it may be possible to distinguish the scents of some very similar odorants , for example between those that are deuterated and non - deuterated .",
    "@xcite it was suggested as early as 1938 that the sensing of vibrational spectra of molecules  @xcite  later proposed to occur via electron transfer  @xcite  could play an important role in olfaction , supplementing ( rather than replacing ) the existing lock - and - key model .",
    "recent work , focussing on constructing and exploring model systems that capture the important physical processes ,  @xcite has shown that this is indeed a viable proposition",
    ". the suggested mechanism , which harnesses vibrationally - assisted et in a similar manner to inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ,  @xcite can be viewed as an example of a molecular switch , wherein specific vibrations of an external molecule actuate the receptor and lead to a pronounced electron flow .",
    "detection via the frequency of vibrations could help to discern two molecules that are otherwise very similar .",
    "however , the need for clear discrimination of the difference in et dynamics in the presence and absence of the odorant imposes certain design principles on the molecular switch , which may or may not lead to the employment of quantum phenomena to optimise performance .",
    "previously , a receptor - odorant spin - boson model was introduced to describe the vibrationally - assisted et process at the heart of the proposed mechanism .",
    "@xcite using an analysis based on the semiclassical marcus - jortner ( mj ) formula for the et rate , @xcite it was shown that for certain parameter values the rates for et in the presence and absence of the odorant can differ drastically .",
    "this indicates how the et process could help in molecular recognition via sensing of vibrational spectra ; sensitivity of the switch to the presence or absence of the odorant can be understood as a significant difference in typical timescales , or more generally in the population dynamics , for processes with or without the odorant coupled to the receptor . additionally , in refs .",
    "further evidence supporting a vibrationally - assisted mechanism was obtained from sophisticated quantum chemistry calculations .    inspired by the possibility of vibrational sensing in olfaction , we focus here on the physical model of a molecular switch tuned for frequency detection .",
    "we go beyond the mj approach to look at both frequency selectivity and detailed dynamics in a variety of regimes in which a semiclassical analysis breaks down . starting from a microscopic hamiltonian describing the odorant ( as an oscillator ) , receptor ( as a donor - acceptor two - level system ) , and environment ( as a collection of independent oscillators ) ,",
    "we derive a polaron - representation master equation for the et process .",
    "@xcite from this we may extract the relevant et rates , extending previous analyses to a broader set of parameters and looking in more detail at the assumptions required for the mj rates to be valid ; in fact , these rates arise naturally from our master equation in the semiclassical limit where the temperature is high compared to the energy scales of the environment . in general , we find that the dynamics of donor - acceptor ( da ) populations predicted by our master equation can differ considerably from that given by the simpler mj rates .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is the assumption inherent to the mj analysis of exponential et from donor to acceptor , which we find to be invalid for a wide set of parameter values .",
    "our approach also has the crucial advantage of allowing us to additionally incorporate the effects of dissipation on the odorant mode , since it is treated explicitly in our formalism .",
    "we shall show that by introducing sufficiently strong mode dissipation , it is possible to bring the da dynamics derived from our master equation into a simpler exponential form .",
    "however , even within this strongly dissipative regime , our master equation predictions can still differ markedly from the semiclassical mj theory , depending upon the specific nature of the environment experienced by the da pair .",
    "in particular , we show that while in the mj case the receptor is very sensitive to the presence or absence of the odorant , it is far less so to the specific odorant vibrational frequency .",
    "we find , however , that the frequency resolution can be enhanced by considering environments which contain components of similar or larger energy to that set by the ambient temperature , i.e.  by working outside the semiclassical limit .",
    "more generally , we show that when considering odorant mode dissipation , both the sensitivity of the switch to the presence or absence of the odorant , and to the resonance conditions between the odorant and the da pair , can be significantly amplified in comparison to the dissipationless case .",
    "we thus find that odorant dissipation plays a constructive role in enhancing the vibrational sensing capabilities of our molecular switch .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : model ] by describing the molecular switch model and giving an estimate of the parameters relevant to our analysis . in section  [ sec : incoherent ] we briefly outline the derivation of our polaron - representation master equation , with further details given in the appendix .",

    "this includes the mj rate analysis as a limiting case , but can also go well beyond the restricted regime of validity of such an approach .      for consistency with the published literature , we follow the estimation of parameters presented in refs .  .",

    "a similar rate can also be derived when the odorant is present in the receptor . in this situation",
    ", we must deal with a more complex system , as the reduced density operator ( after tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom ) now encompasses both the two - level da pair and the odorant harmonic oscillator .",
    "obtaining general equations of motion for the da populations becomes significantly more involved .",
    "however , this is unnecessary if we instead look at et rates between specific states of the combined da - odorant system .",

    "as before , in situations in which the limit @xmath34 does not apply , we may instead use eq .",

    "we shall see below that this has important implications for the dynamics of the da pair over a wide range of parameters , often invalidating the treatment of inelastic et as being a one - way process .",
    "we are now in a position to compare our full polaron master equation [ eq .  ( [ me ] ) ] with a model in which the donor population simply decays with the et rates calculated in the previous section .",
    "specifically , we would like to know how reliably we can apply a rate analysis , such as the mj evaluation employed in previous studies ,  @xcite to parameter regimes estimated to be relevant to the olfactory process . we have already seen that with the odorant present , the possibility of transfer from acceptor to donor can not be neglected when close to resonance .",
    "this is especially true when the inelastic process dominates , as the reverse rate in the elastic case is suppressed by a factor @xmath124}$ ] . without further assumptions ,",
    "we thus expect exponential decay from donor to acceptor to hold only when the et is mediated primarily by the environment ( @xmath125 ) , rather than by the odorant itself .",

    "the receptor is taken to be initialised in the donor state , with the odorant mode and the environment in thermal states , of @xmath126 and of @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "@xcite as can clearly be seen , the et dynamics can differ considerably between the two methods .",
    "as expected , the best agreement is found for large reorganisation energies ( right column ) , where elastic transfer due to the environment dominates over inelastic transfer via the odorant . on the other hand ,",
    "when the odorant does play a significant role in mediating the et , then the agreement is generally poor , with our master equation predicting da dynamics that can not be fitted by a single exponential form .",
    "@xcite this is particular true in the low - frequency environment limit ( @xmath128 ) shown in panels ( i ) and ( ii ) , to which the mj rates would usually be assumed to apply .",
    "@xcite these discrepancies suggest , in fact , that it is the combination of population accumulation within the odorant and the inherent competition between forward and backward processes that limits the timescale for complete transfer from donor to acceptor in the master equation .",
    "we can thus gain further insight by looking at the population dynamics of the odorant mode . in fig .",
    "[ osc - dyn ] we plot the evolution of the lowest two odorant states as predicted by our master equation , for the same parameter sets as in fig .",
    "[ rates - dynamics ] .",
    "note that other levels are never significantly populated , since the total initial energy is insufficient to further excite the mode . in the cases",
    "in which the odorant - assisted ( inelastic ) rate dominates , excitation is quickly transferred from the da pair to the odorant .",
    "the electron is then equally likely to be found on the acceptor ( having deposited energy to the odorant mode ) as it is on the donor . due to the equality of the forward and backward rates on resonance , the only way energy can now exit the system , to allow full et to the acceptor , is into the environment , the timescale for which is dependent upon the reorganisation energy and cut - off frequency . since the rate analysis that leads to the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ rates - dynamics ] ignores the possibility of reverse acceptor - to - donor transfer , it consequently overestimates the inelastic transfer rate .",
    "it is worth noting that even for the cases in which the master equation dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ rates - dynamics ] appears to reach a ( quasi ) steady state with the donor and acceptor similarly populated , in fact full et from donor to acceptor does still eventually occur , albeit on a very long timescale .",
    "of course , in any realistic physical setting , the odorant mode would not be isolated from the environment .",
    "in mj theory , for the semiclassical limit to be valid in the presence of the odorant an implicit assumption is made that the odorant vibrational mode dissipates its energy to the environment on a timescale much shorter than that of the et process .",
    "however , within our master equation approach we can explicitly include mode dissipation , and indeed explore the effects of varying the associated rate .",
    "thus , by contrasting the dynamics illustrated here in the absence of odorant dissipation with that in its presence in the next section , we can investigate the detailed role such dissipation plays in vibrationally - assisted et .",
    "we shall show that for strong dissipation we can recover exponential inelastic et , though generally at a rate that differs from the semiclassical mj formula .",
    "furthermore , we shall demonstrate that reducing the level of odorant dissipation can in fact act to limit the frequency detection properties of the receptor , suggesting that strong dissipation may actually be beneficial for obtaining frequency selective switching processes .",

    "( [ daodorantabsent ] ) and  ( [ daodorantpresent ] ) , while the other panels encompass parameter ranges outside the mj limit .",
    "we see that in each plot there clearly exists a frequency window for which the tunneling rate is enhanced in the presence of the odorant above the background . furthermore , this window becomes narrower as the environmental cut - off frequency is increased ( middle and bottom panels ) , suggesting that the structure of the environment can play an important role in tuning the selectivity , and hence frequency resolution , of the receptor da pair .",
    "crucially , this can not be predicted by the semiclassical mj rates , which do not depend on the environmental cut - off , and predict a significant enhancement of tunnelling even for odorant vibrational frequencies relatively far off - resonant with the da energy gap of @xmath154  mev ( top panel ) .",
    "the low - frequency environment regime analysed in previous works  to which we have shown the mj rates to apply under strong mode dissipation  is thus very sensitive the presence or absence of the odorant , but not necessarily to the odorant s specific vibrational spectrum .",

    "we take @xmath157  mev , @xmath144 , and all other parameters are from table [ partable ] .",
    "the three curves correspond to different levels of dissipation on the odorant : @xmath139 ( red , dashed ) , @xmath130 ( blue , dotted ) and @xmath131 ( grey , solid ) .",
    "the blue points correspond to the same ratio calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ahsansrate ] ) , considering @xmath158.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is evident from fig .",
    "[ outofres ] , however , that increased frequency resolution comes at a cost . in order to achieve the more selective behaviour apparent with a larger environmental cut - off ( and strong odorant dissipation ) , the coupling to the continuum environment must be reduced .",
    "furthermore , the switch suffers from intrinsically higher levels of noise , since the peak values of the ratio @xmath159 also become smaller as the cut - off is increased .",
    "we can therefore conclude from our analysis that a tradeoff exists in which the combination of moderate to high frequency components in the environment and a lower reorganisation energy is advantageous for odorant vibrational frequency resolution , though not necessarily for discrimination simply between the presence and the absence of the odorant .",
    "it is worth noting also that the validity of the results derived from our polaron transformed hamiltonian rely on the assumption @xmath160 .",
    "it is not possible , therefore , to extrapolate fig .",
    "[ outofres ] to yet lower reorganisation energies within the present analysis .",
    "finally , we stress that if we move out of the regime of strong odorant dissipation , we find that both the frequency resolution of the receptor and its sensitivity to the presence or absence of the odorant decreases . this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ peakplot ] , which shows the ratio of the transfer time ( to @xmath161 population on the acceptor site ) in the absence of the odorant to that in its presence for different levels of odorant dissipation .",
    "we use the transfer time to allow a meaningful comparison here , since there is no single rate that accurately describes the dynamics outside the strongly dissipative case . as the dissipation rate",
    "is decreased , the height of the peak also decreases , while its width remains similar ( dotted curve ) until the dissipation ceases to play a role ( dashed curve ) .",
    "thus , as the mode dissipation is weakened , the receptor frequency resolution is severely compromised , as well as its capability to distinguish between the cases with and without the odorant present .",
    "we have developed a dynamical theory of a molecular switch and applied it to investigate vibrationally - assisted et in the context of a proposed olfactory process .",
    "we have shown that the dynamics of the olfactory receptor can differ dramatically from that predicted by semiclassical mj theory , even for a low - frequency environment , if vibrational dissipation is weak .",
    "the et dynamics can , however , be brought into agreement with a simpler rate analysis  though not generally the mj rates unless the semiclassical limit also applies  provided that strong dissipation is allowed to act on the odorant vibrational mode .",
    "this results in an enhanced switching with respect to the dissipationless case .",
    "furthermore , we have found that low frequency environments , to which the mj rates apply under strong odorant dissipation , do not provide good odorant frequency resolution in the et rates . by modifying environmental parameters to move beyond the semiclassical limit it is , nevertheless , possible to substantially increase this resolution and thus select for odorants of a particular frequency .",
    "while our present model is motivated by the problem of describing olfaction in biological systems , it actually corresponds to a wide variety of physical settings in which vibrationally - assisted transport processes are important .",
    "examples include nano - mechanical oscillators coupled to two - level systems ,  @xcite such as quantum dots  @xcite and superconducting qubits ,  @xcite as well as other biological systems such as the photosynthetic reaction centre in certain organisms .",

    "the markov approximation amounts to replacing the state at time @xmath171 in the integrand of eq .",
