    "@xmath0-carinae is probably one of the most remarkable stellar object to have ever been documented .",
    "about 150 years ago , the star began a 20 year long giant eruption during which it radiated a supernova - like energy of roughly @xmath1   ( @xcite  @xcite ) . throughout the eruption it also shed some @xmath2 of material carrying approximately @xmath3 as kinetic energy ( @xcite  @xcite ) , while expanding at a velocity of @xmath4 ( @xcite  @xcite , @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0-carinae can therefore serve as a good laboratory for the study of atmospheres at extreme luminosity conditions .    at first glance",
    ", it appears that the star shed a large amount of material .",
    "indeed , the inferred mass loss rate during the great eruption of @xmath5 is significantly larger than the mass loss rate inferred for the star today ( @xmath6 , @xcite  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , considering that the luminosity during the great eruption is estimated to be significantly above the eddington limit , we shall show that the star should have had a much higher mass loss rate .",
    "in fact , it should have lost during the 20 year eruption more mass than its total mass , giving rise to an obvious discrepancy .",
    "a review of our current knowledge of @xmath0 car can be found in @xcite . in section [ sec : wind ] we summarize how a wind solution for the star @xmath0 car should be constructed . since the luminosity is very high , the effects of convection must be taken into account . in section [ sec : discrepancy ] we integrate the wind equations to show that no consistent solution for @xmath0 car exists within the possible range of observed parameters .",
    "section [ sec : bad ] is devoted to possible classical solutions to the discrepancy , showing that no such possibility exists . in section [ sec : good ] , we show that a porous atmosphere is a simple and viable solution to the wind discrepancy .",
    "since the mass of @xmath0-car is estimated to be of order @xmath7 ( @xcite  @xcite ) , the average luminosity in the great eruption was clearly super - eddington ( of the order of 5 times the eddington limit ) .",
    "that is to say , the radiative force upwards , assuming the smallest possible opacity ( for ionized matter ) given by thomson scattering , was significantly larger than the gravitational pull downwards .",
    "optically thin winds formally diverge at the eddington limit ( e.g. , @xcite  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , a consistent wind solution requires an optically thick wind .",
    "we thus look for a wind in which the sonic point ( which is the point at which the local speed of the outflow equals the speed of sound ) is below the photosphere .",
    "moreover , since the duration of the eruption is longer than the sound crossing time of the star by about a factor of 50 , a stationary wind appears to be a good approximation .    in practically all super - sonic wind theories which describe super - sonic outflows from an object at rest ,",
    "a consistent stationary solution is obtained only when the net driving force of the wind ( excluding the pressure gradient ) vanishes at the sonic point which is actually an approximation to the line transfer equations .",
    "if we had written the proper radiation transfer equations for this case which only _ implicitly _ depend on @xmath8 , we would have recovered that the sonic point coincides with the point at which the total force vanishes ( cf @xcite  @xcite  107 )",
    ". moreover , line driven winds are important only under optically thin conditions while we describe the optically thick part of the wind . ] .",
    "thus , material experiencing a super - eddington flux necessarily has to be above the sonic point .",
    "if most of the envelope carries a super eddington flux , then no consistent stationary wind solution can be obtained and in fact , the object will evaporate on a dynamical time scale . in most systems however , this need not be the case .",
    "for example , in very hot systems ( e.g. , hot neutron stars during strong x - ray bursts , @xcite  @xcite ) , the opacity in the deep layers is reduced due the reduced klein - nishina opacity for compton scattering at high temperatures .",
    "thus , the sonic point in these objects is found where the temperature is high enough to reduce the opacity to the point where the flux corresponds to the local eddington limit .",
    "another important effect , which should be taken into account , is convection .",
    "deep inside the atmosphere , convection can carry a significant part ( or almost all ) of the energy flux , thus reducing the radiative pressure to a sub - eddington value .",
    "in fact , as the radiative flux approaches the eddington limit , convection generally arises and carries the lion share of the total energy flux ( if it can ) to keep the system at a sub - eddington level ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "although the total flux in the entire envelope ( or almost all of it ) can be equivalent to a super - eddington flux , up to some depth below the photosphere , convection carries most of the flux so as to reduce the radiative flux alone into a sub - eddington value . a consistent wind solution should therefore , have its sonic point at the location where the most efficient convection can not carry enough flux any more .",
    "as we shall soon see , the problem in @xmath0-car is that this point is relatively deep within the atmosphere , where the density is so high that the expected mass loss is significantly _ higher _ than the observed one .    to see this in a robust way we integrated numerically the wind equations starting from the photosphere inwards .",
    "the equations are those that describe optically thick spherically symmetric winds ( @xcite  @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of mass conservation , momentum conservation and temperature gradient are @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 with standard notation .",
    "the parenthesized term in the last equation is a simple approximate interpolation that has the correct asymptotic limits for optical depths much larger and much smaller than unity ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the last equation is the integrated form of the energy conservation equation . unlike the aforementioned references , we specifically include advection by a maximally efficient convection .",
    "thus , the integrated form of the energy conservation equation becomes @xmath12 were @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total energy output of the star , the wind mass loss rate , the observed luminosity at infinity and the kinetic energy flux at infinity . on the other hand , @xmath17 are respectively , the local radiative luminosity , velocity , enthalpy , convective flux and advected flux ( as internal and kinetic energies ) .",
    "the expression adopted for @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the internal energy per unit volume and @xmath21 is the speed of sound . by no means can convection be more efficient than this expression since highly dissipative shocks are unavoidable at higher speeds .",
    "it is likely that the maximally efficient convection is somewhat less efficient than this expression , but this will only aggravate the problem that we shall soon expose .",
    "detailed calculations of the wind were carried out .",
    "the calculations include the latest version of the opal opacities ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that the total opacity below the photosphere has comparable contributions from thomson scattering and absorption processes .",
    "this implies that the _ modified _ eddington limit , in which the thomson opacity is replaced by the local total opacity , is somewhat lower than the classical eddington limit .    since @xmath22k car during the eruption would be more negative , increasing the eddington factor .",
    "if the temperature is lower than @xmath23k , the opacity at the photosphere and outwards rises abruptly ( @xcite  @xcite ) , thus reducing the modified eddington limit . in both cases , the discrepancy will be aggravated .",
    "] , the average luminosity implies a photospheric radius of @xmath24 .",
    "note that since it is a thick wind , the exact definition of the photosphere is ambiguous .",
    "nevertheless , different definitions do not change the results by more than @xmath25 .",
    "knowing that the observed mass loss rate is roughly @xmath26 ( which gives the observed @xmath27 of shed material in 20 years , @xcite  @xcite ) , a specified flow speed at the photosphere can be translated to a required density .",
    "we can therefore integrate the wind equations inwards .",
    "if a consistent wind solution can be obtained for some value of the imposed velocity in the photosphere ( which has to be between @xmath21 and @xmath28 ) , then the integration inwards should reach a sonic point at which the total force on the gas vanishes .",
    "this will be attained if the convective and advective fluxes can carry a significant amount of the total flux so as to reduce the residual radiative flux to a sub - eddington one .",
    "we define the luminosity needed to be carried by convection and advection in order to bring about the vanishing of the total local force as @xmath29 .",
    "if enough energy is advected and convected then @xmath30 will be reduced to the local modified eddington flux : @xmath31 with @xmath32 the local opacity which can be larger than the thomson opacity .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxes ] ) , the critical advective+convective flux can be written as @xmath33    figure [ fig_1 ] shows the fraction @xmath34 at the sonic point .",
    "a consistent solution can be found only if @xmath35 at the sonic point .",
    "inspection of the figure clearly shows that the space of possible observed values does not contain a viable and consistent solution .",
    "this is of course irrespective of whether a solution from the photosphere outward can or can not be obtained .",
    "the discrepancy arises because a wind corresponding to the observed low mass loss rate necessarily has a sonic point that is not deep enough to have either convection or advection as an efficient mean of transporting energy .",
    "this can be seen from the optical depth at which the sonic point is obtained . in all cases , @xmath36",
    ". however , convection is efficient only up to an optical depth of @xmath37 for @xmath38 ( @xcite  @xcite ) , or even deeper for larger radiation pressures ( i.e. , when close to the eddington limit ) .",
    "can the discrepancy be resolve with a classical assumption ? since the discrepancy is rather large , assuming the wind to emerge from an angular fraction @xmath39 from the star does not relax the problem ( it actually aggravates the problem because more material will be blown away from the higher luminosity regions ) . another possibility that fails",
    "is having a higher velocity in the photosphere than the one observed today for the shed material .",
    "this might be the case if the wind collides with previously ejected slow moving material .",
    "even if such material did exist , the necessarily reduced mass loss rate inferred from the present day observed momentum aggravates the problem .",
    "the problem is not mitigated if we relax the assumption that the mass loss rate and the luminosity are assumed to be constant in time throughout the eruption .",
    "if one wishes to solve the problem using magnetic fields , then a solution can be found only if the magnetic energy density at the photosphere is significantly larger ( by several orders of magnitude ) then the equipartition value with the gas pressure .",
    "this of course seems unlikely .",
    "another option is to have the distance estimate to @xmath0-car be three times smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "a shorter distance will remove @xmath0-car out of the cluster tr16 of massive stars inside which it is observed and leave it instead roaming the inter galactic arm space .",
    "considering the short lifetime of the star , just a few million years , this possibility appears as very unlikely .",
    "the problem can be solved if the mass of the star corresponds to a sub - eddington luminosity .",
    "this proposed solution requires @xmath0-car to be at least a @xmath41 star .",
    "however , this suggestion is at variance with much lower estimates ( see for instance @xcite  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , having such a massive star is in fact not completely unrealistic and would have far reaching consequences if found to be true .",
    "as the title suggests , there is a clear solution to the discrepancy .",
    "as the results show , the sonic point appears to be between the optical depths of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the exact value can not be obtained since it requires the integration outward from the photosphere , which owing to the relatively inaccurate effective temperature and therefore opacity , yields a wide range of results .",
    "if the _ mean _ radiative force between the point @xmath35 and the above found optical depth , is smaller than classically estimated , then a solution to the discrepancy can be found .",
    "such a reduction in the mean radiative force is a natural result if the atmosphere is inhomogeneous .",
    "@xcite has shown that in an inhomogeneous atmosphere , the effective opacity used to calculate the average force is reduced relative to the effective opacity used for the radiation transfer in a homogeneous medium .",
    "the effective opacity used for the average force should be a volume _ flux weighted _ average of the opacity per unit volume @xmath44 .",
    "namely , @xmath45    the effect is universal and arises in inhomogeneous systems that conduct heat or electricity .",
    "extensive discussions exist in the literature under a different terminology ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the only requirement is therefore , that close to the eddington limit the star develop inhomogeneities . the transformation from an homogeneous to an inhomogeneous atmosphere at luminosities close to but below eddington luminosities ,",
    "was recently found to take place generically even in thomson scattering atmospheres ( @xcite  @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that two different types of instabilities arise naturally when the luminosity approaches the eddington limit ( @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "one instability is of a phase transition into a _ stationary _ nonlinear pattern of  fingers \" that facilitate the escape of the radiation .",
    "the second type of instability allows the growth of a propagating wave , from which one expects a _ propagating _ nonlinear pattern to form .",
    "the two possibilities are summarized in figure [ fig_2 ] .",
    "both instabilities bring about a reduction of the average radiative force on the matter and a significant reduction of the mass loss rate since the sonic surface can sit near ( or not much below ) the photosphere . in both cases , the nonlinear pattern is necessarily expected to form in the region between the radius @xmath46 at which @xmath35 , or in other words , that @xmath47 is large enough to have @xmath48 , and the photosphere .",
    "when the pattern is stationary , the rarefied regions have a larger than eddington flux and the sonic surface in these regions is near @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the pattern is propagating , the flux may be larger locally than the eddington limit but the time average of the force on a mass element is less than eddington .",
    "since the instability does not occur above the photosphere , it should be homogeneous and hence super - eddington with a super - sonic flow .",
    "further analysis of the instabilities is needed to know which instability will dominate though it is more likely to be the phase transition since it is dynamically more important .",
    "to summarize , the super - eddington luminosity emitted by @xmath0-car should have generated a much thicker wind with a sonic point placed significantly deeper than what can be directly inferred from the observations . a solution which lives in harmony with observations and theoretical",
    "modeling is a porous atmosphere , which allows more radiation to escape while exerting a smaller average force .",
    "it also means that the eddington limit is not as destructive as one would a priori think it must be , even in a globally spherically symmetric case .",
    "namely , all astrophysical analyses that employ the eddington limit as a strict limit should be reconsidered carefully , even if they involve only unmagnetized thomson scattering material .",
    "if @xmath0-carinae could have been super - eddington for such a long duration without `` evaporating '' , other systems can display a similar behavior ."
