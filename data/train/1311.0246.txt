    "the technique of chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) , invented in the mid 1980s @xcite , has revolutionized laser technology and boosted the laser power outputs by several orders of magnitude in a short time .",
    "current efforts aimed at reaching multi - petawat powers all rely on advances made in cpa @xcite .",
    "laser acceleration of electrons @xcite and ions @xcite to energies that may find application in medicine , the industry or the study of the fundamental forces and the structure of matter in nature , stand to benefit from the strides made in laser technology .",
    "see the recent reviews @xcite for more on these extreme laser - matter interactions .",
    "linearly - chirped pulses have recently been suggested as a means to accelerate particles @xcite .",
    "the main idea stems from the realization that chirping the frequency destroys the symmetry of the pulse sensitively , making energy gain possible by the particle from synchronous interaction with the low - frequency parts of the field @xcite . according to the lawson - woodward theorem @xcite particle interaction with a perfectly symmetrical plane - wave pulse results in zero net energy gain .",
    "a chirp breaks the symmetry and circumvents the lawson - woodward theorem .",
    "more on the mechanism of acceleration will be presented shortly .",
    "the rest of this letter presents results of simulations of the dynamics of a single electron submitted to high - intensity laser pulses , chirped linearly and quadratically ( the latter being employed here for the first time , to the best of our knowledge ) .",
    "exit gev electron kinetic energies , reached as a result of interaction with finite duration pulses , are obtained by solving the relativistic equations of motion numerically .",
    "the laser wavelength is @xmath1 m and @xmath2.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]",
    "the electron will be treated as a point particle of mass @xmath3 and charge @xmath4 , and its relativistic energy and momentum will be denoted , respectively , by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the velocity of the particle scaled by @xmath8 , the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath9 .",
    "the laser fields , on the other hand , will be represented by ( si units ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant amplitude , @xmath12 is a suitably - chosen function whose dependence on the space - time coordinates is through the combination @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the frequency and @xmath15 the wavenumber , and @xmath16 will denote an appropriate pulse - shape function . chirping",
    "the plane - wave is then tantamount to letting @xmath14 vary with the time in some fashion . in this work ,",
    "we take @xmath17 , a power chirp , and work with @xmath18 ( linear chirp ) and @xmath19 ( quadratic chirp ) . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the unchirped angular frequency , @xmath21 is a dimensionless chirp parameter and @xmath22 . in terms of the unchirped wavelength , @xmath23 .",
    "the model adopted here introduces the frequency time - variations indirectly , namely , through @xmath24 rather than directly via the time @xmath25 .",
    "for example , a linear chirp is customarily modeled by @xmath26 , and so on .",
    "thus our dimensionless chirp parameter may be related to the parameter @xmath27 , employed in the general field of signal processing , by @xmath28 , with units of @xmath29 .    for the plane - wave field function , we will take @xmath30 .",
    "this function takes the following form in the case of a power chirp @xmath31 where @xmath32 is some initial phase which we take equal to zero , for simplicity .    on the other hand ,",
    "two choices will be made for the pulse - shape .",

    "parameters of the two pulse - shapes have been chosen so that the field has the same number of 15 cycles . the fields are almost identical in the central region of the figure .",
    "thus , if they undergo similar chirping ( both linear or both quadratic , using the same chirp parameter value ) which , in turn , distorts them in the central region , they will present the electron with identical space - time variations and lead to essentially the same energy gain .    , but for a quadratic chirp @xmath44.,width=321 ]    for the sake of solving them numerically , the relativistic newton - lorenz equations may be combined to give @xmath45,\\ ] ] equation ( [ betaeq ] ) can be integrated analytically , using @xmath46 as a variable , for only very specialized situations .",
    "the main working expressions for the analysis of the particle dynamics have been developed using unchirped @xcite and chirped pulses @xcite .",
    "two constants of the motion were identified @xcite which made it possible for some end results to be obtained fully analytically in terms of fresnel sine and cosine integrals . to save space in this paper , however , we resort to numerical integration instead .     of the electron kinetic energy",

    "thus , one integrates from @xmath54 ( marking onset of the particle - field interaction ) to some @xmath55 ( at which the interaction terminates ) .    a single electron injected in the way just described possesses axial relativistic momentum initially .",
    "one constant of the motion @xcite implies that the @xmath56component of the particle s momentum remains zero throughout .",
    "thus the electron follows a 2d trajectory ( in the @xmath57plane ) @xcite .",
    "transverse motion is mainly due to @xmath58 , while axial motion is governed by @xmath59 . on the other hand ,",
    "energy is gained from synchronous interaction with the low - frequency parts of the field brought about by the chirp .",
    "the rate of energy gain is @xmath60 .",
    "note that the low - frequency portions ( to be exhibited in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , below ) lack symmetry .",
    "thus interaction with them results in tremendous energy gain and very little loss .    ,",
    "but for a quadratic chirp with @xmath61 .",

    "[ fig4].,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    to achieve energy gains in the gev regime , relativistic laser field intensities will be required .",
    "although finite - duration pulses will be used in our calculations , yet the dimensionless parameter @xmath62 familiar from discussions of electron interaction with an infinite plane wave , will be used here .",
    "this parameter is related to the intensity @xmath63 by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the permittivity of free space . inserting values of the universal constants ,",
    "one gets @xmath66 = 1.36817\\times10^{18}\\left[\\frac{a}{\\lambda_0[\\text{$\\mu$m}]}\\right]^2,\\ ] ] which makes @xmath67 a dimensionless intensity parameter .",
    "exit electron kinetic energies are presented in figs . [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , following interaction with the trapezoidal and @xmath0 down - chirped ( @xmath68 ) laser pulses , as functions of the chirp parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the following discussion applies to both cases of linear chirp ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and quadratic chirp ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . in all calculations , the front end of each pulse",
    "is assumed to have caught up with the electron at @xmath51 at the coordinate origin .",
    "interaction with the highly symmetrical parts of the pulse leads to no net gain .",
    "substantial net gain results from interaction with those parts of a particular pulse that have been distorted by chirping , as will be illustrated shortly .",
    "thus not all values of @xmath21 result in gain , while some values do lead to a sharp rise in the electron kinetic energy , which it retains after having been left behind the pulse .    for small ranges of @xmath21 values , around @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the energy gain is independent of the pulse - shape employed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the central regions of the two pulses are almost identical in the unchirped case and suffer approximately the same distortion after being chirped similarly ( same @xmath21 ) . since the two pulse - shapes are almost identical , apart from the width of the central region , they lead to kinetic energy minima and maxima at identical values of @xmath21 . outside these regions of @xmath21 values ,",
    "the peaks resulting from interaction with the trapezoidal pulse are substantially higher than the corresponding ones stemming from interaction with the @xmath0 pulse .",
    "this is due to the difference in pulse width between the two .",
    "the trapezoidal pulse is wider and presents the electron with more chance to interact ( with a wider distorted , essentially quasi - static , electric field ) .",
    "while the above discussion has focused on similarities between the linear and quadratic chirp results , there are two important distinctions .",
    "the absolute maximum energy gain from a linear chirp is almost twice that from a quadratic chirp .",
    "this may be intuitively understood to arise from two factors , both can be inferred from studying figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] below . the quasi - static portion , which we understand to be responsible for the acceleration , is wider in the linear case than in the quadratic .",
    "this leads to more particle interaction time with the field and , hence , to more energy gain , in the former compared to the latter .",
    "furthermore , the figures show that the quadratically - chirped fields exhibit more oscillations than the linearly - chirped ones .",
    "recall that interaction with the highly symmetrical oscillations always results in little or no gain ( or loss ) of energy .",
    "furthermore , comparable gains are achieved which correspond to values of @xmath71 that are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller in the quadratic case than in the linear case .",
    "this could be an advantage the quadratic chirp has over the linear chirp , a speculation on our part that remains to be confirmed experimentally , hopefully sometime soon .    in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , evolution of the electron s kinetic energy @xmath72 with @xmath46 ( which implicitly contains dependence upon @xmath25 and @xmath73 ) is shown for values of @xmath21 picked from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath21 chosen in each case corresponds to a point where the calculated gain in energy is the same for both pulse - shapes ( pulse - shape independent ) . with each kinetic energy evolution",
    "graph the ( chirped ) normalized electric field seen by the electron , during interaction with the corresponding pulse , is also shown .",
    "synchronized interaction is clearly evident in all figures .",
    "little gain , if at all , from interaction with the symmetrical field oscillations on the pulse wings , is also clear .",
    "more strikingly obvious is the tremendous gain that stems from interaction with the distorted central parts of each pulse .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy evolution curves during interaction with both pulses ( same kind of chirp ) have the same general structure . while the absolute maximum reached in the case of the trapezoidal pulse",
    "is slightly higher , both pulse - shapes result in the same exit energy gain , as has already been explained above .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a single electron submitted to quadratically chirped plane - wave single laser pulses of finite duration , gains multi - gev energy . for the parameter set",
    "used in this paper , it has been shown that the electron exit kinetic energies can reach about one half what would result from interaction with a linear chirp .",
    "of course , with the gev energies created the question of radiative reactions appears to be relevant @xcite .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath21 employed in our calculations have been quite small , in the range @xmath74 ( linear ) and @xmath75 ( quadratic ) .",
    "these ranges correspond roughly to : @xmath76 ( linear ) and to @xmath77 ( quadratic ) . a quick look at figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] may give the impression that a slight deviation from the @xmath21 value which leads to a typical peak in the exit kinetic energy of the electron would necessarily result in a substantial decrease in the peak energy sought .",
    "this casts some doubt about the stability of the laser system used , unless thinking in terms of @xmath27 , rather than @xmath21 , is more experimentally relevant .",
    "production of linear and quadratic chirps suitable for experimental realization of the ideas proposed in this work may be currently challenging .",
    "one final remark is in order concerning the quasi - static portion of the pulse field . strictly speaking ,",
    "a low - frequency part may contain a zero - frequency component .",
    "however , as has recently been demonstrated @xcite , a small band of low frequencies may , in principle , be filtered out without affecting the energy gain appreciably .",
    "moreover , small dc modifications may be added to the wings to allow for the requirement that the integral under the pulse ought to vanish , again without leading to appreciable changes in the results .",
