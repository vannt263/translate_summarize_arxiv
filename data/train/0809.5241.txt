    "neutron diffraction measurements were performed on the d1b spectrometer at the institut lae langevin ( ill ) with an incident neutron wavelength of 2.52  .",
    "the magnetic long range order was already studied in ref . from the same data .",
    "the magnetic cross section was isolated by subtracting a spectrum measured at 1.2 k. the magnetic diffraction pattern at 0.1 k ( inset fig 1a ) shows an intense small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) signal for @xmath10 @xmath40.2 @xmath11 , arising from ferromagnetic correlations . the sans signal ( fig .",
    "1a ) strongly increases with decreasing t , and flattens in the range of the transition .",
    "it was fitted by a lorentzian function @xmath16q@xmath17 .",
    "good fits are obtained down to about 0.6 k , but the fit quality decreases below .",
    "the fit however allows one to estimate the medium correlation length l@xmath7 @xmath18 = 1@xmath19@xmath20 ( fig .",
    "1b ) versus temperature in the ordered region . with decreasing temperature",
    ", l@xmath7 @xmath18 increases from values close to the near neighbor distance between tb@xmath2 moments ( d=3.686  ) , to about 18(6 )   below 0.8 k. this value is about 10 times smaller than that deduced from the width of the magnetic bragg peaks ( l@xmath7=190   as shown in ref . ) but its temperature dependence is quite similar . the parameter a increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "its variation compares well with that of the lro squared magnetic moment deduced from the bragg peak intensity , although it is less sharp in the transition region ( fig .",
    "[ h ] [ width= ] fig2.eps    [ h ] [ width=8 cm ] fig3.eps    [ h ] [ width=0.8 ] fig4.eps    [ h ] [ width=0.8 ] fig5.eps    the short range order ( sro ) yields a diffuse magnetic scattering which remains clearly visible at 0.1 k. this scattering was not analyzed in ref . .",
    "here we refined it as a magnetic structure , assuming that it has the same symmetry as the lro , but a much shorter correlation length .",
    "the relative contributions of the sro and lro are shown in fig .",
    "2 . from the fit",
    ", we obtain values of lro and sro moments of 5.8(1 ) and 3.3(3 ) @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the value of the lro moment , ordered at the scale of 190   deduced from the width of the bragg peaks , agree with the value previously determined of 5.9(1)@xmath21 .",
    "the sro moment compares well with the value of about 3 @xmath21 obtained by calibration of the diffuse magnetic scattering measured with polarized neutrons@xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that a large amount of the tb@xmath2 moments remains ordered at a very short length scale , estimated here to 4(1 )   from the refinement , therefore comparable to the distance between first neighbor tb@xmath2 moments ( 3.686  ) . assuming that both types of correlations contribute to the neutron intensity independently",
    ", we estimate the total ordered moment to m= 6.6(2 ) @xmath21 @xmath19 tb .",
    "we notice that this value is exactly the value calculated for the total local moment within the crystal field model ( fig .",
    "15 of ref . ) .",
    "the above analysis shows the presence of three characteristic length scales for the spin correlations at low temperature , with values ranging from the first neighbor distance to length scales of about 18 cubic unit cells ( the lattice constant a = 10.426  ) .",
    "a distribution of length scales was previously inferred from an independent analysis of the profile peak shape@xcite .",
    "the analysis above motivates a study of the slow spin dynamics at different @xmath10-ranges , where either short or long length scales dominate . for this purpose we performed",
    "energy resolved neutron scattering measurements on the in16 backscattering spectrometer of the ill , with an incident neutron wavelength of 6.27  .",
    "this instrument offers a dynamic range of @xmath12 15 @xmath8ev for the observation of fluctuations characterized by a quasielastic response . due to the large angular acceptances of the backscattering method the wave - vector transfer resolution is rather relaxed , anyhow sufficient to discriminate regions of interest with or without contributions from the bragg peaks associated with the long - range ordering process .",
    "optionally one can switch off the energy transfer analysis to follow only the elastic response within the resolution window of 1 @xmath8ev at full width half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "accordingly one can obtain a temperature scan of the elastic contribution over the whole @xmath10-range and compare intensity in specific @xmath10-bands to the temperature variation observed for the bragg peaks in the diffraction experiment .",
    "the sample was packed in a 1 mm thick flat can in order to minimize the sample absorption .",
    "the transmission was evaluated to 0.9 .",
    "the counting time was 12 hours for each temperature .",
    "a vanadium sample of the same shape was measured to calibrate the angle dependent detection efficiency and determine the energy resolution .",
    "the spectra were corrected for background and absorption using spectra of the empty sample holder measured in the same conditions , taking into account the specific corrections due to the backscattering geometry @xcite .",
    "temperature scan of the elastic resolved scattering was taken in the range 0.1@xmath221.4 k. the quasielastic spectra were recorded in a range 0.1@xmath231.9  @xmath11 .",
    "they were grouped into five @xmath10-bands , three bands out of the bragg peaks , and two at the bragg peak positions .",
    "the @xmath10-bands outside the bragg peaks are respectively called the low @xmath10-band , ( @xmath24 @xmath11 ) , the medium @xmath10-band ( @xmath25 @xmath11 ) and the high @xmath10-band ( @xmath26@xmath11 ) .",
    "the q - bands at the bragg peak positions are respectively @xmath27 @xmath11 and @xmath28 @xmath11 , the first for the 111 and 200 together ( not well resolved individually ) and the second for 220 contribution .",
    "the 311 bragg peak is out of the accessible @xmath10-range .",
    "we have situated these @xmath10-bands in the diffraction pattern of the fig .",
    "one sees that the bragg @xmath10-bands mostly probe the long length scales ( the bragg intensity dominates ) , whereas the low , medium and high-@xmath10 bands probe the shortest lengthscale .",
    "we also note that the nuclear bragg contribution on all of the above peaks is either zero or negligible , and that the overall nuclear incoherent contribution is also small due to the small incoherent cross - sections of the elements . by fitting the vanadium patterns with a gaussian function , we get an energy resolution at half width half maximum ( hwhm ) of 0.4 @xmath8ev in the bragg peak and large angle regions , and 0.55 @xmath8ev in the low angle region .",
    "typical energy resolved neutron scattering patterns are shown in fig .",
    "3 , in the @xmath10-band covering the 111 and 200 bragg peaks . they clearly show a quasi - elastic signal in the temperature range 0.8 - 1.2 k. the quasielastic signal strongly narrows with decreasing temperature , which reflects the freezing of the spin dynamics around the transition .",
    "the neutron intensity was fitted by the sum of three contributions .",
    "first , an elastic ( or resolution - limited ) signal of intensity c@xmath29 , of magnetic origin mostly , accounts for the spins which fluctuate at time scales longer than the resolution limit .",
    "second , a lorenzian function of intensity c@xmath0 and half - width at half maximum ( hwhm ) @xmath30 accounts for the quasi elastic signal .",
    "the lorenzian quasi elastic signal was convoluted by the instrumental resolution . an energy - independent flat level @xmath31background@xmath31 c@xmath32 accounts for the @xmath31fast@xmath31 fluctuations ( or short time scales ) , corresponding to energy widths larger than the energy window . above 1 k",
    ", the flat level and the rather broad lorentzian contributions can not be determined independently with good accuracy .",
    "so , the value of c@xmath32 was fixed to the value at 0.9 k. below 0.6 k , the quasielastic linewidth has the same order of magnitude as the resolution , and the flat level vanishes .",
    "the parameters deduced from the fits are plotted versus temperature in fig . 4 in the @xmath10-band of the 111 and 200 bragg peaks .",
    "similar results are obtained for the @xmath10-band of the 220 peak . the elastic intensity c@xmath29 increases with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "its temperature variation scales quite well with that of the bragg intensity deduced from diffraction data .",
    "the latter represents a constant angle integral of the scattering cross - section over energy transfers up to the incident neutron energy ( inset fig .",
    "4 ) . just below t@xmath7=0.87(2)k , the intensity measured by diffraction increases more sharply with decreasing @xmath14 than the elastic intensity .",
    "the differences in the @xmath14-dependence of the bragg peak and the elastic resolved intensities can be explained by two factors , one being the possibility of integrating the @xmath31fast@xmath31 dynamics ( represented by the flat level in the energy resolved experiment ) , the other the coarser @xmath10-resolution of the time resolved patterns , which integrate a contribution from the sro not included in the bragg peaks of the diffraction patterns .",
    "the quasielastic intensity c@xmath0 shows a broad maximum in the transition region , where the contribution from the fast fluctuations starts to enter the energy window .",
    "as @xmath14 decreases further , c@xmath0 starts to decrease when the spectral weight is transferred to the elastic intensity .",
    "the energy width 2@xmath30 decreases rapidly down to 0.8 k ; a quasielastic signal of width close to the resolution limit remains at 0.09 k. the energy independent flat level c@xmath32 also decreases with decreasing temperature . at 0.09 k , there is no visible contribution of the @xmath31fast@xmath31 fluctuations to the energy pattern and c@xmath32 was fixed to zero .",
    "the temperature variations of the parameters c@xmath29 , c@xmath0 , c@xmath32 and @xmath30 reflect a freezing of the spin dynamics .",
    "the elastic contribution increases at the expense of the @xmath31fast@xmath31 fluctuations and quasielastic contributions , whereas the decrease of the linewidth reflects the increase of the relaxation time probed in the time window of the measurement .",
    "the lorentzian line shape of the quasielastic signal corresponds to a relaxation process which involves spin fluctuations with a lifetime @xmath33 ( @xmath4s(0).s(t)@xmath5@xmath34 e@xmath35 ) . taking the fourier transform of this expression yields @xmath33=@xmath36@xmath19@xmath30 , where @xmath36=0.658 10@xmath3 @xmath8ev .",
    "s ( see note ) .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of the relaxation time is shown in fig .",
    "4 c. at 0.09 k , the time scale of the spin fluctuations is equal to @xmath33@xmath37=1.3 10@xmath3  s ( @xmath30= 0.5 @xmath8ev ) .",
    "energy spectra in the low , medium and high @xmath10-bands also probe a freezing of the spin dynamics . here",
    ", no contribution of a flat level was detected and the fits were performed with c@xmath29 and c@xmath0 contributions only . their variations ( fig .",
    "5 ) reflect those at the magnetic bragg peaks .",
    "the @xmath30 values at 0.09 k are higher , probing fluctuations at shorter time scales ( @xmath33@xmath37 @xmath15 0.3 - 1 10@xmath3  s ) .",
    "the relative weight of the @xmath31fluctuating@xmath31 spins with respect to the @xmath31static@xmath31 spins at low temperature is also higher in the @xmath10-bands outside the bragg peaks . here",
    "the terms @xmath31static@xmath31 and @xmath31fluctuating@xmath31 refer to the time scale defined by the instrumental resolution of in16 ( 1.3 @xmath13  s ) and sensitivity of the fit .",
    "one notices that due to the limited time window and the strong change of the correlations with temperature , the opposite variations of the quasielastic and elastic intensities during the freezing process do not compensate in a given @xmath10-band .",
    "namely , at the bragg peaks the @xmath31loss@xmath31 in the quasielastic intensity with decreasing temperature is much smaller than the @xmath31gain@xmath31 in the elastic intensity , whereas the reverse situation occurs outside the bragg peaks .",
    "the above features show a distribution of time scales , which extends to longer times with decreasing temperature , as the characteristic length scales of the spin correlations increase .",
    "somewhat similar effects are seen in other frustrated magnets .",
    "a distribution of fluctuation times concomitant with a distribution of correlation lengths is observed by neutron scattering in disordered systems such as spin glasses @xcite .",
    "a broad range of time scales in absence of long - range order but with remarkably energy(time)-scale invariant short - ranged correlations was also seen in the well - known geometrically frustrated kagome spin system scgo @xcite .",
    "the time scale of the fluctuations is in rather good agreement with the time scale probed by neutron spin echo ( nse ) experiment@xcite in the range of the transition ( @xmath33 @xmath15 0.2 10@xmath3  s for t=0.8 k and @xmath10=0.08 @xmath11 ) . at 0.1 k ,",
    "when nse did not observe further dynamics , our experiment in the backscattering geometry still suggests fluctuations at a time scale @xmath33@xmath37 with @xmath33@xmath37 ranging from 1.3 to 0.3 10@xmath3s , the shortest time scales corresponding to the sro .",
    "fluctuations at longer time scales than @xmath33@xmath37 do exist ( the elastic scattering ) , but no faster fluctuations are probed ( there is no residual background in the energy window ) .",
    "the life time of the spin fluctuations may be compared to that probed by @xmath8sr experiments@xcite . in ref . , the @xmath8sr response was interpreted by a relaxation process between different configurations of the local field b@xmath38 .",
    "the typical time @xmath39 of this process can be evaluated from the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath40 by the relation @xmath39@xmath15 @xmath40@xmath19(@xmath41@xmath42b@xmath43 where @xmath41@xmath42 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio . at 0.1",
    "k @xmath39 could be evaluated to 8 10@xmath44 s in ref .",
    "( taking b@xmath38=0.2 t ) and 5 10@xmath3 s in ref .",
    "( taking b@xmath38=0.02 t ) .",
    "our estimation of the life time ( @xmath33@xmath37 @xmath150.3 - 1.3 10@xmath3s ) situates in between these values .    on the other hand , the fluctuations at longer time scales than @xmath33@xmath37 , clearly seen by neutrons ( they give rise to the elastic scattering and to a static response in the nse experiment ) , do not yield any static component in the muon spectra .",
    "a strong fully static component can not be excluded by the neutron data , but seems to be incompatible with the muon ones . to investigate this point further",
    ", we computed the muon depolarization in presence of a dipolar field randomly reversing with the frequency @xmath45 , as done in ref . .",
    "this shows that fluctuations with a frequency @xmath45@xmath52@xmath41@xmath42b@xmath38 should wash out the precession signal , clear - cut signature of a static field in the muon data .",
    "for b@xmath38=0.02  t , this yields a higher limit of 2 10@xmath46s for the typical time scale @xmath33=1/@xmath45 of the fluctuations@xcite , which is still compatible with the lower limit of 1.3 10@xmath3s given by the instrumental resolution of in16 .",
    "this is no longer true for the higher value b@xmath38=0.2  t. comparison between muon and neutron data therefore favor a lower estimation of the internal field .",
    "the fluctuations of the local field in ordered spin ice tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 found by @xmath8sr found by are quite similar to those observed in the parent spin liquid tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . in both compounds , the short scale fluctuations may involve tunnelling or thermally activated excitations between the six degenerated configurations of the spin ice structure . in ordered tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 , such excitations may also help to @xmath31switch@xmath31 domains of longer length scales . in tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "our results suggest a homogeneous picture where different correlation lengths involve different spin components and different time scales , rather than a coexistence of independent clusters with different sizes . in the pyrochlore spinel zncr@xmath0o@xmath47 and related compounds ,",
    "a cluster - like scattering process has been invoked , with the presence of emergent excitations within loops of strongly bound hexagonal clusters @xcite .",
    "more recently however , theoretical work on the @xmath31true@xmath31 spin ice dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 showed that this picture does not necessarily imply real independent clusters and that long range interactions are relevant@xcite .",
    "whether such picture can be extended to describe excitations in the ground state of the ordered spin ice tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 , in which we observed multiple length scales , remains a matter for further theories .",
    "in conclusion , in tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 ordered spin ice we have observed a freezing of the spin fluctuations which involves the coexistence of different correlations lengths and times scales .",
    "the distribution extends to longer times with decreasing temperature .",
    "a marked slowing down is observed in the transition region , in agreement with previous muon and neutron spin echo experiments . at the lowest temperature ,",
    "the time scale of the spin fluctuations ranges between 1.3 and 0.3 10@xmath3 s. fluctuations at longer time scales are also observed by neutrons , whereas they give no clear - cut signature in the muon spectra .",
    "this may be compatible with the low estimation of the local field ( b@xmath38=0.02  t ) found in @xmath8sr .",
    "the presence of multiple time scales remains to be understood in further theoretical work .",

    "<S> , several inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed to study the magnetic fluctuations in tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> crystal field excitations@xcite were measured down to 1.4 k and compared to those in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , which remains spin liquid down to about 50 mk . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the wave functions describing the ground and first excited states of the tb@xmath2 ion are exchanged in the two compounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these differences in the local states of the tb@xmath2 ion can not explain the different cooperative ground states in the ti and sn compounds within the frame of current theories .    </S>",
    "<S> neutron spin echo ( nse ) measurements@xcite were performed in tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 for a moment transfer @xmath10=0.08 @xmath11 , outside the bragg peak positions , probing the dynamics of the ferromagnetic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> they clearly observed some spin dynamics down to 0.8 k , but failed to detect any below . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the magnetic cross section was measured by polarized neutrons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin dynamics was deduced from the comparison between diffraction measurements ( integrating the magnetic signal over all energies up to 3 mev ) and elastic scattering with a coarse energy resolution ( integration over an energy window of @xmath120.15 mev ) . at 0.04 k , the authors conclude to the presence of static bragg peaks , together with a liquid - like structure factor arising from spins moving faster than 0.04 thz .    here </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the spin correlations and dynamics in tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 by combining neutron diffraction and energy resolved neutron scattering measurements , with a very high energy resolution of 0.5 @xmath8ev at half width half maximum , probing time scales up to 1.3 @xmath13  s. both measurements were performed in the temperature range 0.1 k-1.4 k. the @xmath10 and @xmath14 dependence of the magnetic scattering was analyzed quantitatively , considering not only the bragg scattering , but also the medium and short range correlations . </S>",
    "<S> diffraction data measured at 0.1 k show the coexistence of several length scales , corresponding to first neighbors ( @xmath154  ) , medium ( 18  ) , and long range ( 190  ) correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the spin dynamics was investigated in different @xmath10 ranges where either short or long length scales are dominant . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath14 decreases , we observe a freezing of the spin dynamics for all length scales , with a stronger effect in the region of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> some spin fluctuations persist down to the lowest temperature of 0.1 k. we discuss these results with respect to the fluctuations in the ground state in tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 .    </S>",
