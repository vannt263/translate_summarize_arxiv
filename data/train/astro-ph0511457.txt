    "however , in its present form there are still residuals to the fit in several of the sources .",
    "these residuals tend to occur in the 6  8  kev region , and show a variety of features : some may be absorption edges or notches , some emission lines ( narrow and broad ) .",
    "the disc reflection model is very smooth due to the relativistic blurring , it can not produce a notch , though the model can explain features that look like absorption edges .",
    "the sharper features are therefore probably due to iron ( and possibly other elements like nickel ) emission and absorption , with the broader features due to either absorption from gas in the line of sight or iron emission from further out in the disc  perhaps from regions excited by magnetic reconnection .",
    "it is possible that our current model of a geometrically flat accretion disc with a power law emissivity index does not accurately represent all the agn studied .",
    "+ the photoionized reflection spectra are generated by a model of illumination onto a slab of gas of constant density .",
    "this is unlikely to be the situation in a real agn accretion disc , but is a necessary approximation to allow the calculation of a large grid of models such that fits can be performed with ` xspec ` .",
    "previous studies have compared constant density reflection spectra to those which use a more physical density distribution ( e.g. hydrostatic equilibrium , which still requires assumptions about the structure of the disc and other factors like the external coronal pressure ) .",
    "ballantyne , ross & fabian ( 2001 ) found that their hydrostatic equilibrium model could be approximated well by a `` diluted '' constant density model , where diluted means that the reflection fraction of the constant density model is smaller than the reflection fraction of the hydrostatic model it is fitting .",
    "this happens because an outer layer of the disc becomes highly ionized ( a low density means a high ionization parameter ) to the point where it produces no line features , and the lines form in a partially hidden layer below this .",
    "this may mean that the flux fractions we measure in section [ fluxfrac_section ] are too low , some of the emission we interpret as due to the illuminating power law might be reflection from a highly ionized surface layer .",
    "+ an accretion disc is an uncontroversial component in a model of an agn , but our model involves an accretion disc illuminated by a power law .",
    "this raises the question of the origin of the illuminating radiation .",
    "a corona of hot electrons above the accretion disc is often hypothesised , and can produce a power law by comptonisation of uv disc photons ( or bremsstrahlung or synchrotron emission ) .",
    "alternatively a small hot - spot , either the base of a jet , shocks in a failed jet ( ghisellini , haardt & matt 2004 ) or a region excited by a magnetic flare above the disc , can produce the necessary radiation .",
    "this model seems more likely in the context of our results  we have several sources where the illuminating continuum is not visible to us ( table [ disc_fit_table ] , figure [ flux_frac_figure ] ) and this can be explained by the light bending effects of the central black hole ",
    "photons emitted from sources above the disc tend to be bent towards it and very few escape to be observed , increasing the measured flux fraction by supressing the power law .",
    "reflected radiation escapes the black hole more easily , it is dopper beamed along the plane of the disc , away from the black hole .",
    "this is discussed in miniutti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that our results show no correlation between flux fraction and inclination , so we consider that doppler beaming along the disc is not the dominant factor .",
    "this would also be the case if the illuminating hot spot rotates with the disc , sharing the same velocity and beaming ; unlikely for jet based illumination but expected for magnetic flares above a disc or a corona .",
    "the consistently small inner radius is difficult to explain with magnetic flares . alternatively , with a small power law emitting region",
    "it is possible that the power law radiation is obscured , although since 1 in 3 of the sources have no power law component and all sources have disc components the geometry of the absorber is difficult to imagine .",
    "our favoured scenario is a small power law illuminating region above the central black hole , where light bending effects mean that the illuminating power law radiation can be deflected onto the disc and not be detected ..",
    "+ one further problem that the relativistically - blurred photoionized disc reflection model can solve is the general absence of strong iron lines in agn spectra .",
    "an accretion disc illuminated by x - rays should produce an iron line .",
    "the disc reflection model shows that the iron line is present , but relativistically blurred to such an extent that it is hard to detect , see figure [ nufnu_figure ] .",
    "we investigated a large sample of type 1 agn x - ray spectra , and fit them with the relativistically - blurred photoionized disc reflection model of ross & fabian ( 2005 ) .",
    "this work has shown that :    * the relativistically - blurred photoionized disc reflection model fits the sample better than the conventional simple model . since the disc reflection model is physically motivated , unlike the simple model , it can also give us direct information about the inner accretion disc .",
    "* the disc reflection model reproduces the continuum shape of all the agn in the sample , in particular the soft excess is naturally explained by the model .",
    "the soft excess is composed of many broad lines mixed together . *",
    "the disc reflection model reproduces many features in the spectrum that could otherwise be interpreted as warm absorption edges .",
    "* the majority of black holes in the sample are strongly rotating , alternatively it is possible that radiation from the plunging region is important .",
    "* the inclinations measured from the sample span the range of 20@xmath50  90@xmath50 , so neither edge of the distribution is consistent with the simplest unified model",
    ". however , there is a deficit at inclinations @xmath0 so there is some evidence for torus obscuration . *",
    "the disc reflection model provides evidence that the iron abundances of black hole accretion discs tend to be solar or mildly sub - solar .",
    "we have shown that the relativistically - blurred photoionized disc reflection model is an important tool in the study of agn , and that taking account of the intrinsically relativistic nature of these sources not only provides information about the state of the system , but explains the apparent absence of iron line reflection from the disc and the shape and behaviour of the soft excess .",
