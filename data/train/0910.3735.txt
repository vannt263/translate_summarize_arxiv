    "the idea of hierarchical galaxy formation , in which galaxies are believed to form from the aggregation of smaller elements ( see review by @xcite ) , has been around since @xcite first proposed this theory as a challenge to the belief that galaxies formed through the smooth collapse of a large protocloud @xcite .",
    "the identification of debris from these smaller fragments remains of utmost importance in modern studies of theoretical and observational stellar dynamics .",
    "the most massive galactic globular cluster , @xmath0 cen , has several unique physical properties which suggest that there are very significant differences in star formation histories , enrichment processes and structure formation between @xmath0 cen and other normal globular clusters @xcite .",
    "a commonly accepted scenario of formation of @xmath0 cen is that it is the surviving nucleus of an ancient dwarf galaxy , the outer envelope of which was entirely removed by tidal stripping as it was accreted by the galaxy ( @xcite and references therein ) . through numerical simulations , @xcite demonstrated the dynamical feasibility of @xmath0 cen forming from an ancient nucleated dwarf galaxy which was accreted into the young galactic disk .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulations to investigate the characteristics of tidal debris from satellite galaxies .",
    "they showed that these satellites deposit a large fraction of their stars into either the disc component of the milky way or into the halo , showing distinct  trails \" in the angular momentum ",

    "the radial ( u ) velocities for the @xmath0 cen candidate stars are observed to have a symmetric distribution , ranging from -300 to 300 km s@xmath1 .",
    "an earlier simulation by @xcite of the accretion of the @xmath0 cen parent galaxy showed a strong plume of debris stars in the solar neighborhood with l@xmath2 near @xmath3 kpc km s@xmath1 .",

    "dinescu defines this region by assessing three globular clusters ( @xmath0 cen , ngc 362 and ngc 6779 ) that are believed to have come from the same original parent galaxy , and argues that their distribution may define the area in which further candidate remnants could lie .",

    "the stars of the kapteyn group , as most recently tabulated by eggen ( 1996 ) , are mostly metal - poor and in retrograde galactic orbits , so they were identified as a halo moving group . moving",

    "some form from a common gas cloud . as the resulting cluster disperses",
    ", its stars dissolve into the galactic background yet maintain some common kinematical identity which may be used to identify members of a particular stellar group .",
    "such moving groups represent a transition between bound clusters and field stars , and are probably chemically homogeneous ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other moving groups appear to result from resonances in the galactic disk ( eg @xcite ) , and others possibly as the debris of accreted and disrupted dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we were interested to see whether the kapteyn group members were chemically similar , because this would be a pointer to the group s origin .",
    "it turned out that some of the group stars show chemical peculiarities similar to those seen in @xmath0 cen , and we will argue that the kapteyn group may be part of the @xmath0 cen debris .",
    "concentrations of metal - poor stars at l@xmath2 values near those of @xmath0 cen and the kapteyn group have appeared in several recent studies . @xcite investigated substructure in a sample of stars with [ fe / h]@xmath5 from the beers et al ( 2000 ) catalog and identified a structure ( their feature k ) which appears to be related to the kapteyn star group .",

    "both photometric and spectroscopic atmospheric parameters were derived for each star .",
    "photometric temperatures were derived via the alonso ( 1999 ) calibration with v - k using v magnitudes from eggen ( 1996 ) and k magnitudes from the 2mass catalogue .",
    "photometric gravities were found via absolute magnitudes and bolometric correction calibrations provided by @xcite and @xcite using the standard relationship shown in equation 6 and assuming a mass for these stars of 0.8m@xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42    measured equivalent widths of both fe i and fe ii lines were used to derive spectroscopic temperatures and gravities . the usual comparison between excitation potential and derived abundance was made to determine effective temperature while the balance between abundances derived from neutral and ionised iron lines was used to refine the gravity of the star .",
    "the microturbulent velocity was obtained by measuring fe i lines and ensuring that the derived abundances be independent of equivalent width .",
    "figure [ spvscs ] shows the agreement between spectroscopic and photometric temperatures derived .    with two exceptions , the photometric and spectroscopic temperatures differed by less than 200k , while photometric and spectroscopic gravities differed by less than 0.50 dex .",
    "atmospheric parameters obtained spectroscopically , which were used throughout this analysis , are shown in table [ atmosparam ] for each of the sample stars .",
    "the atmospheric parameters derived via spectroscopic analysis were adopted instead of the photometric ones for consistency , because the abundance analysis uses spectroscopic data . in the case of one star , bd -13 3834 , a reliable model atmosphere could not be found .",
    "while the spectroscopic and photometric effective temperatures agreed to within 250k , the disagreement between the log g values was 1.3 dex .",
    "this was considered too large a disagreement to make either value reliable and so this star was discarded from the sample .",
    "the estimated errors on t@xmath43 are taken from the largest difference found between spectroscopic and photometric values .",

    "the analysis for these stars included atomic line lists from kurucz with refined oscillator strengths for all lines via a reverse solar analysis using the kitt peak solar spectrum.spect.php ] the na d lines were used to obtain the sodium abundance . in metal - poors stars , such as these , these lines do not saturate and provide a reliable estimate of the sodium abundance .",
    "the spectrum synthesis program used ( moog ) has an option to deal with strong lines separately during the analysis .",
    "hyperfine splitting components were taken into account for the na d lines and lines of both cu and ba .",
    "this reverse solar analysis was done with a solar model of t@xmath43=5770k and log g=4.44 .      as well as error introduced by uncertainty in continuum placement , which is always minimised as much as possible ,",
    "there are three main sources of uncertainty in these derived abundances .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty is the spread in derived abundances from multiple lines of the same element .",
    "although in theory this should be small , different lines of the same element can give abundances differing by as much as 0.2 dex .",
    "this can be due to incorrect log gf values , although in this study a reverse analysis using the sun was done for all elements to reduce this problem ( see earlier in section 4 for more details ) .",
    "non - lte effects , blending and data quality problems can also contribute .",
    "this dominant error contribution is tabulated as the @xmath21 value in table 7 .",
    "where abundances are obtained from only one line ( as for zr and occasionally other elements ) , the @xmath21 value is the uncertainty from a single line measurement , as discussed below .",
    "the second source of uncertainty is the accuracy with which is is possible to determine an abundance from any particular line .",
    "this uncertainty can vary depending on line strength , blending and crowding in the region , and the overall quality of the data . in this study , this error contribution is estimated to be no more than about 0.1 dex .",
    "the third source of uncertainty is the difference in abundances obtained using different atmospheric parameters in the stellar models .",
    "this depends on how well the atmospheric parameters can be constrained .",
    "table [ abundsens ] shows the dependence of derived abundances on the chosen atmospheric parameters .",
    "these values were obtained by choosing equivalent width values which gave abundances representative of those obtained via spectrum synthesis and then running an abundance analysis on these equivalent widths with four different models , with @xmath46t@xmath43=-200k , @xmath46log g=-0.3 and @xmath46@xmath48=-0.30 km s@xmath1 .",
    "these @xmath46 values represent slightly higher uncertainties on the atmospheric parameters than the ones estimated in this study ( see table [ atmosparam ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that atmospheric parameters influence different lines , stressing the importance of ascertaining the correct model atmosphere at the outset .",

    "the copper value seen in cd -30.1121 is consistent with the field halo star trend seen in copper and the observed low copper does not necessarily exclude it as a field halo star , as the kinematics suggest .",

    "it should be noted that results from a very recent study of 66 red giant stars in @xmath0 cen by @xcite strongly supports these results .",
    "they find a general increase in [ na / fe ] with increasing metallicity , from @xmath7[na / fe]@xmath8=+0.03 ( @xmath21=0.32 ) at the lower metallicity end to @xmath7[na / fe]@xmath8=+0.86 ( @xmath21=0.12 ) for higher metallicity .",
    "they also find @xmath7[ca / fe]@xmath8=+0.36 ( @xmath21=0.09 ) , la values varying from [ la / fe]=-0.4 to + 2.0 and @xmath7[eu / fe]@xmath8=+0.19 ( @xmath21=0.23 ) .",
    "these results strongly overlap with the previous studies of @xmath0 cen stars used as a comparison with the kapteyn group stars in this study .",
    "a parametric t - test and a non - parametric kolmogorov - smirnov test were performed on the abundance distributions .",
    "the results are shown in tables 10 and 11 respectively . in these tests ,",
    "a small p value means that the two populations are distinct .",
    "we adopted the standard criterion that p@xmath53 is needed to reject the null hypothesis .",
    "the tables show that both the parametric and non - parametric test gave the same results .",
    "tests in which the p value satisfied the requirement are shown in bold , indicating that the two populations compared are statistically different .",
    "@xmath0 cen and the halo were seen to be distinct separate populations in all of the five element distributions , in both tests .",
    "the kapteyn group and the halo were statistically different in [ na / fe ] , [ ls / fe ] and [ hs / fe ] while the [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] comparison is inconclusive .",
    "the kapteyn group and @xmath0 cen differ only in [ ca / fe ] .",
    "while the [ hs / fe ] abundance patterns seen in kapteyn and @xmath0 cen in figure [ heavy]b differ slightly , there is enough overlap in the two groups for this overlap to be statistically significant and the statistical analysis suggests these two distributions can come from the same population .",
    "there appear to be only two ba enhanced stars in the kapteyn group sample , although both are seen at values consistent with ba enhancements seen in @xmath0 cen stars .",
    "the apparent lack of ba enhanced stars in the kapteyn group may be due to a small sample size of only 16 stars .",
    "together with figures 7 and 9 , these statistical tests show that [ ca / fe ] does not differ enough between the populations to give reliable discrimination .",
    "the [ ca / fe ] relationship in figure 7 is tight and all populations overlap .",
    "however , the difference seen in the remaining four elements provide enough information to show that the field halo stars are different from both the kapteyn stars and the @xmath0 cen stars and that the kapteyn group stars are chemically similar to those in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the kinematic and abundance analysis in this study suggests that at least our 14 members of the kapteyn group and potentially many more stars in retrograde orbits which were not observed in this study , could be remnants of tidal debris stripped from the parent galaxy of @xmath0 cen , or even from the cluster itself , during its merger with the galaxy .",
    "our study provides the first detailed chemical evidence of field stars that appear to be both kinematically and chemically related to @xmath0 cen .",
    "it may lend weight to the view that @xmath0 cen is the remnant nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy which was accreted by the milky way , by providing chemical evidence of tidal debris among the galactic field stars .",
    "the three - banded structure seen in the lindblad diagrams of figures 3 and described in section 2.1 may be indicative of stars shed with different energies from different wraps of the decaying orbit of the parent galaxy around the milky way .",
    "the reader is referred to figure 6 in meza et al .",
    "( 2005 ) which shows several distinct e ",
    "l@xmath2 curves from their numerical simulations of merger debris . in this study",
    "there is currently no evidence for an abundance difference between stars of different wraps of the orbit .",
    "a study involving higher quality data and a larger number of stars from these wraps is underway .",
    "the presence of this banded structure , along with the present galactic radius of @xmath0 cen , suggest the original parent galaxy was relatively massive in order for dynamical friction to have the required effect , and was also relatively dense in order to survive the galactic tidal stresses in to the current orbital radius of @xmath0 cen .    what else can we infer about the parent galaxy ?",
    "if our stars are debris from the parent galaxy , then the galactic metallicity - luminosity relationship and the mean metallicity of the sample ( @xmath54 } \\rangle = -1.5 $ ] ) indicate that the parent galaxy s luminosity would have been about @xmath55 .",
    "its luminosity would have been about @xmath56 l@xmath57 , and its stellar mass @xmath58 m@xmath57 .",
    "this stellar mass is comparable to the present stellar mass of @xmath0 cen itself .",
    "the total mass of the parent galaxy could have been as high as @xmath59 m@xmath57 if it were a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter content similar to the fornax dsph ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "what are the chances of finding @xmath0 cen debris stars in the solar neighborhood from such a low - mass galaxy ?",
    "we can use the meza et al .",
    "simulation as a guide , although a detailed comparison is not appropriate as these authors note , because their end - product galaxy is not like the milky way . in summary ,",
    "the debris of their satellite is well mixed azimuthally by redshift 0.48 , at least within 10 kpc radius from the center of their parent galaxy , and is confined to a disk - like layer .",
    "the satellite is disrupted in its last three perigalactic passages , leaving a significant amount of substructure in e and l@xmath2 .",
    "we focus on the lowest @xmath60 substructure in their simulation , as a qualitative counterpart to the proposed @xmath0 cen debris .",
    "most of our stars lie in a volume of radius @xmath61 pc around the sun , and in a broad range of retrograde l@xmath2 . for comparison",
    ", we can estimate the fraction of the meza et al .",
    "debris which would lie within our @xmath62 pc volume and within their lowest l@xmath2 substructure : it is about @xmath63 .",
    "we could therefore expect to find about 700 debris stars in our volume and within the lowest angular momentum substructure , if we use the meza et al .",
    "simulations as a guide and assume that the typical star in this population has a mass of about 0.8 m@xmath57 . in the dinescu region shown in figure 3 , we have compiled a total of about 100 stars . even if all of them turn out to be @xmath0 cen debris stars , then this comparison may indicate that there are plenty more @xmath0 cen debris stars to be found nearby .",
    "we should also consider the possibility that the kapteyn group stars were stripped from the cluster itself as its outer regions were disrupted by the galactic tidal field .",
    "this would be the immediate inference from the the chemical similarity which we have demonstrated between the kapteyn group stars and cen stars .",
    "this seems unlikely , because the in - spiralling time under the influence of dynamical friction is in excess of the hubble time for a cluster with the mass of @xmath0 cen ; also , we note that the kapteyn group stars are significantly more energetic than the cluster itself .",
    "it seems likely that the group stars came from the body of the parent dwarf galaxy , and therefore that the chemical peculiarities of @xmath0 cen are shared by its parent , and may well have originated in gas which was funneled into the cluster , possibly over an extended period , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of @xmath0 cen as its galaxy loses mass in the galactic tidal field are needed .",
