    "there is no need to consider all orderings of monomials .",
    "we have to consider only those inequalities between constants and monomials that appear in the construction of the dominant systems .",
    "the hierarchy of systems @xmath355 , @xmath404 , @xmath525 , ... can be used for multigrid correction of the dominant dynamics .",
    "the simple example of multigrid approach gives the algorithm of steady state approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "for this purpose , on the way up ( cycle restoration and cutting , sec .",
    "[ subsecrestore ] ) we calculate distribution in restoring cycles with higher accuracy , by exact formula ( [ cyclerate ] ) , or in linear approximation ( [ cyclelimratelin ] ) instead of the simplest zero - one asymptotic ( [ cyclelimzero ] ) .",
    "essentially , the way up remains the same .",
    "after termination of the gluing process , we can find all steady state distributions by restoring cycles in the auxiliary reaction network @xmath435 .",
    "let @xmath526 be fixed points of @xmath527 .",
    "the set of steady states for @xmath435 is the set of all distributions on the set of fixed points @xmath528 .",
    "let us take one of the basis distributions , @xmath529 , other @xmath81 on @xmath435 . if the vertex @xmath530 is a glued cycle , then we substitute them by all the vertices of this cycle .",
    "redistribute the concentration @xmath531 between the vertices of the corresponding cycle by the rule ( [ cyclerate ] ) ( or by an approximation ) . as a result",

    "the resulting distribution is the approximation to a steady state of @xmath355 , and the basis of steady states for @xmath355 can be approximated by this method .",

    "[ dom1 ] we have , first of all , to compute the stationary distribution in the cycle @xmath532 , @xmath533 and @xmath534 . on the base of the general formula for a simple cycle ( [ cyclerate ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath535    after that , we have to restore the cycle glued into @xmath503 .",
    "this means to calculate the concentrations of @xmath183 and @xmath536 with normalization @xmath537 .",
    "formula ( [ cyclerate ] ) gives : @xmath538    for eigenvectors , there appear two operations of corrections : ( i ) correction for an acyclic network without branching ( [ correction ] ) , ( [ eigenvectorcorrection ] ) , and ( ii ) corrections for a cycle with relatively slow outgoing reactions ( [ circlecorrection ] ) .",
    "these corrections are by - products of the accuracy estimates given in appendix .",
    "now , the idea of limiting step is developed to the asymptotology of multiscale reaction networks .",
    "we found the main terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues asymptotic on logarithmic straight lines @xmath539 when @xmath5 .",
    "these main terms could be represented by acyclic dominant system which is a piecewise constant function of the direction vectors @xmath346 .",
    "this theory gives the analogue of the @xcite theory for chemical reaction networks .",
    "we demonstrated also how to construct the accuracy estimates and the first order corrections to eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "there are several ways of using the developed theory and algorithms :    * for direct computation of steady states and relaxation dynamics ; this may be useful for complex systems because of the simplicity of the algorithm and resulting formulas and because often we do not know the rate constants for complex networks , and kinetics that is ruled by orderings rather than by exact values of rate constants may be very useful in practically frequent situation when the values of the various reaction constants are unknown or poorly known ; * for planning experiments and mining the experimental data  the observable kinetics is more sensitive to reactions from the dominant network , and much less sensitive to other reactions , the relaxation spectrum of the dominant network is explicitly connected with the correspondent reaction rate constants , and the eigenvectors (  modes \" ) are sensitive to the constant ordering , but not to exact values ; * the steady states and dynamics of the dominant system could serve as a robust first approximation in perturbation theory or as a preconditioning in numerical methods .",
    "the next step should be development of asymptotic estimates for networks with modular structure and time separations between modules , not between individual reactions .",
    "but now it seems that the most important further development should be the asymptotology of nonlinear reaction networks .",
    "for multiscale nonlinear reaction networks the expected dynamical behaviour is to be approximated by the system of dominant networks .",
    "these networks may change in time ( this is the significant difference from the linear case ) but remain relatively simple .",
