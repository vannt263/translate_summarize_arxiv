    "the mammalian hippocampus plays a key role in spatial cognition .",
    "place cells , the principal hippocampal neurons , manifest remarkable spatial specificity of spiking activity .",
    "they fire only in select locations in the environment .",
    "these locations are known as their respective place fields @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the place cells spike trains contain information about the animal s current location @xcite , its future @xcite and past @xcite navigation routes , both in the wakeful state and even in sleep @xcite .",
    "moreover , damages to the hippocampal network produce impairments in spatial learning and difficulties in navigation planning @xcite .",
    "it is hence believed that the place cell ensembles encode an internalized  map \" that serves as a basis of animal s spatial awareness @xcite .",
    "* motivation*. an increasing amount of both direct @xcite and indirect @xcite experimental evidence suggests that this map is topological in nature , a rough - and - ready connectivity framework into which other brain regions integrate more detailed metrical information .",
    "a number of approaches have been deployed to understand the neuronal computations that could produce such a framework @xcite . in particular , the approach proposed in @xcite exploits the connection between the place fields covering an environment and the alexandrov - ech theorem , which points out the possibility of reconstructing the topology of a space @xmath0 from the pattern of overlaps between regions that cover @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that the place fields produce a dense cover of the environment suggests that the pattern of overlaps between them contains the information required to represent the environment s topology , which may hold the key to the way in which the hippocampus encodes its topological map of s pace .",
    "this observation is taken further by noticing that the domains where several place fields overlap are precisely the ones where the corresponding place cells cofire .",
    "in other words , the information about the overlap of place fields is represented via the place cell coactivity , which suggests that the alexandrov - ech construction can be carried out not only via geometric pattern of the place field overlaps , but also through the analysis of the place cell coactivities .    *",
    "topological model*. the details of the topological model of the hippocampal map are discussed in @xcite , but in brief , the idea is to represent the combinations of coactive place cells ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ... ,",
    "@xmath3 ) as multi - dimensional polyhedra  the  coactivity simplexes , \" @xmath4 $ ] ( see methods ) . together , these coactivity simplexes form a simplicial  coactivity complex \" @xmath5 . in his construction ,",
    "the individual cell groups , just like simplexes , provide local information about the space ; joined together into a simplicial complex , modeling a neuronal ensemble , they represent space as whole .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that @xmath5 captures the topological structure of the environment and serves as a schematic representation of the hippocampal map @xcite .",
    "for example , the sequences of place cell combinations ignited along the paths traversed by the animal are represented in @xmath5 by chains of coactivity simplexes  the simplicial paths @xcite .",
    "a non - contractible simplicial path may represent a navigational path @xmath6 that encircles a physical obstacle , whereas topologically trivial simplicial paths correspond to contractible routes in the physical space ( figure  [ figure1]a , b ) .",
    "the complex @xmath5 begins to form as soon as the rat starts navigating .",
    "every detected instance of place cell coactivity contributes a simplex to @xmath5 . at the early stages of navigation , when only a few cells had time to produce spikes , the coactivity complex is small , fragmented , and contains many holes , most of which do not represent physical obstacles in the environment .",
    "such holes , which may be viewed as transient  gaps \" in the cognitive map , tend to disappear as spatial learning continues .",
    "the minimal time , @xmath7 , after which the topology of @xmath5 matches the topology of the environment , or more precisely , when the correct number of topological loops emerges , figure  [ figure1]c , can therefore be viewed as a theoretical estimate of the time required to learn the hippocampal map @xcite .    *",
    "parameter dependence*. an important property of the model is that the structure of the coactivity complex @xmath5 and the time course of its formation during learning are sensitive to various parameters of the neuronal firing statistics , which allows studying the net effect produced by these parameters on spatial learning .",
    "for example , the oscillations of the extracellular electrical field potential , typically referred to as the local field potential ( lfp ) , are known to modulate the place cells activity at several timescales .",
    "first , each place cell tends to spike within a small range of the phases of the  theta \" component of the lfp ( @xmath8 , 4 - 12 hz @xcite ) , which depends on the distance that the animal has traveled into the corresponding place field .",
    "as a rat moves through the place field , the preferred @xmath8-range of a place cell progressively decreases with each new @xmath8-cycle , a phenomenon known as the @xmath8-phase precession @xcite .",
    "the preferred @xmath8-phases of different cells are additionally synchronized by the second major component of the lfp , the  gamma \" rhythm ( @xmath6 , 30 - 80 hz , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the period of the more rapid @xmath6-rhythm , @xmath9 , is believed to define the range of the preferred phases within the slower @xmath8-rhythm ; on average a @xmath8-period , @xmath10 , contains about seven @xmath6-cycles , @xmath11 ( see @xcite and figure  [ sfigure1]a ) .",
    "* paths in the environment are represented in a simplicial complex*. ( * a * ) two topologically equivalent paths in a physical environment , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , encircle an obstacle ( white square ) that can not traversed by the rat s trajectory ( grey curve in the background ) and are therefore non - contractible .",

    "since we are primarily concerned with representing topological properties of the navigational paths , in the following we discuss only the @xmath15 skeleton of the coactivity complex .",
    "( * c * ) timelines of the topological loops encoded in the coactivity complex .",
    "as the animal begins to explore its environment , the coactivity complex contains many spurious topological loops most of which do not represent the physical obstacle .",
    "this  topological noise \" disappears after about five minutes , which marks the learning time , @xmath7the moment when the correct topology of space ( one @xmath16 loop representing the obstacle and one @xmath23 loop that informs us that the environment is connected ) has emerged . ]",
    "numerous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies demonstrate that both the @xmath8- and the @xmath6-waves play key roles in spatial , working , and episodic memory functions",
    ". however , most theoretical analyses addressed the way in which the @xmath6-synchronization affects the informational contents of spiking in small networks or in the individual cells .",
    "in contrast , the topological approach allows modeling cognitive map as a whole .",
    "for example , it was used in @xcite to demonstrate that @xmath8-precession makes otherwise poorly performing ensembles more capable of spatial learning .",
    "the present analysis applies the topological model to study the effect produced on spatial learning by the @xmath6-waves and to demonstrate that @xmath6-synchronization of the place cell spiking activity enables the encoding or retrieval of the large - scale spatial representations of the environment by integrating place cell coactivity at a synaptic timescale .",
    "computational modeling of the @xmath8-phase precession is relatively straightforward : at the basic level , it amounts to imposing a particular relationship between a place cell s spiking probability , the phase of the @xmath8-wave and the distance that the animal has traveled into a corresponding place field @xcite ( see methods ) . however , the effects of the @xmath6-rhythm are more diverse .",
    "electrophysiological experiments suggest that there exist at least two types of place cells : the  tropyr \" cells that spike at the trough of the fast @xmath6-wave ( 50 - 80 hz ) and the  rispyr \" cells that fire at the raising phase of slow @xmath6-waves , overriding @xmath8-precession @xcite .",
    "although our approach allows modeling both cell types ( see methods ) , in the following we will model only the tropyr cells that exhibit more robust firing patterns and higher firing rates , and therefore may play a primary role in producing the cognitive map @xcite .    *",

    "the preferred @xmath8-phase of several cells becomes synchronized with a @xmath6-trough , which thereby gates the place cell coactivity .",
    "the literature refers to such groups of coactive place cells as ",
    "dynamic cell assemblies \" ( see @xciteand figure  [ sfigure1]a ) .",
    "modeling @xmath6-modulation therefore requires adjusting the times of the @xmath8-modulated spikes closer to the troughs of the @xmath6-wave @xcite .",

    "the probability that a particle lands at point @xmath24 in a potential @xmath25 is @xmath26 , where the parameter @xmath27 controls the spread of the locations around the minima of @xmath25 . in statistical physics , this parameter is interpreted as the inverse temperature",
    ". higher values of @xmath27 , meaning lower temperatures , imply that the particles are more confined to the bottoms of the wells ( figure  [ sfigure1]b ) .     * gamma synchronization*. ( * a * ) without coupling with the @xmath6-wave ( @xmath27 = 0 , top panel ) the simulated place cell spikes are diffusely scattered over the time axis .",
    "the temporal spread of the place cell coactivity is about a couple of @xmath8-periods , @xmath28 , @xmath29 msec . at @xmath30 , the intervals of place cell coactivity concentrate near domains of high @xmath6-amplitude , @xmath31 . at @xmath32 ,",

    "* @xmath8 and @xmath6 synchronicity*. in our previous study @xcite , we modeled assemblies of independently @xmath8-precessing place cells simply as combinations of neurons that happened to produce spikes within a certain @xmath50-period .",
    "the model predicted that the spatial maps are built reliably if the coactivity inputs are identified over the @xmath8-timescale ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath50 shrinks , the chance of producing and detecting the coactivities within a @xmath50-period diminishes , and the topological map takes longer to form . for the intermediate range of values ( @xmath52 ) ,",
    "the learning time is approximately inversely proportional to @xmath50 , but as @xmath50 reduces to the @xmath6-period , the pool of detected place cell coactivities often fails to capture the topological structure of the environment or requires a much longer time to produce it , exhibiting high variability of @xmath7 upon @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , experimental studies have shown that the synchronicity of the place cell assemblies is best manifested precisely at the @xmath6-timescale @xcite .",
    "this implies that the hippocampal network is capable of producing large - scale spatial maps based on the @xmath6-timescale readouts .",
    "therefore , we hypothesized that the failure of the previous ( @xmath8-driven ) topological model to do that may be due to poorer synchronization in the assemblies of independent neurons driven by common @xmath8-pacemaker , rather than to the physiological cell assemblies that are additionally synchronized through synaptic interactions @xcite .     * influence of @xmath6-modulation on spatial learning in a cell assembly network with coincidence detector readout neurons.*. there are two major parameters of the model : the mean width of the temporal window @xmath50 over which the postsynaptic readout neurons integrate spiking inputs from the place cell assemblies ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , represented by the thickness of the line ) , and the effective temperature @xmath59 which controls the clustering of place cells spikes around the troughs of the @xmath6-wave ( figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath27 ( indicated by the blue color of the colormap ) correspond to tighter coupling between the place cell s spiking probability and the @xmath6-amplitude ( figure  [ sfigure1 ] ) .",
    "( * a * ) the number of @xmath15 simplexes , @xmath60 , in the coactivity complex @xmath5 as a function of @xmath27 , for different @xmath50s . for large integration windows ( thicker lines ) , coupling with @xmath6-wave does not produce significant effect : the @xmath60 changes less along the @xmath27-axis .",
    "as @xmath50 decreases , the number of simplexes drops ( the thinner lines lay below the thicker ones ) .",
    "however , the smaller is @xmath50 , the more increase of the number of coactive place cell combination is produced by the cooling of the cell assemblies : for @xmath61 ( top curve ) the number of @xmath15 simplexes grows by @xmath62 as @xmath27 goes from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "( * b * ) shrinking the integration window @xmath50 increases the total number of topological loops observed in @xmath5 during the course of learning , whereas cooling down the coactivity complex reduces this number .",
    "for example , the number of cold loops ( @xmath27 = 2 ) at @xmath61 is about @xmath65 of the number hot loops ( @xmath27 = 0 ) .",
    "( * c * ) the learning time @xmath7 grows as @xmath50 shrinks and tends to decrease as a function of @xmath27 .",

    ", learning time diverges at @xmath69 . ]    in the present analysis , we use the effective temperature @xmath59 to describe phenomenologically these additional synchronization mechanisms .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ figure2 ] , the parameter @xmath27 controls the temporal spread of the spiking activity in cell assemblies , @xmath38 , independently from @xmath50 and allows transitioning from desynchronized cell assemblies to the cell assemblies that are tightly coupled with @xmath6-troughs .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ figure2 ] also suggest that binding the coactivity of place cell assemblies within @xmath6-periods ( @xmath33 ) should significantly reduce the time required by the downstream networks to detect place cell coactivity .",

    "to describe the effects of the @xmath6-waves on the ability of place cells to encode spatial information , we built the coactivity complex using @xmath6-modulated spike trains for different @xmath27s and studied its topological properties for a set of @xmath50s , including the values for which the independently @xmath8-precessing place cells fail to produce correct topological maps .",
    "the results shown on figure  [ figure3 ] demonstrate that , at large integration windows ( @xmath71 , fat lines ) , tightening the cell assemblies around the @xmath6-troughs does not produce a significant effect on either the structure of @xmath5 or on the times required to learn the map @xmath72 .",
    "this outcome is easy to explain : if the readout neurons accumulate epsps at the @xmath8-timescale , i.e. , over hundreds of milliseconds , the temporal arrangement of the spikes at the @xmath6-timescale does not change the combinations of coactive place cell detected downstream .",

    "third , the learning times drop significantly : for @xmath27 = 2 , the @xmath7 computed for @xmath74 reduce by about @xmath65 compared to the desynchronized , @xmath27 = 0 case , which indicates that @xmath6-synchronization allows building a topological map based on the coactivity information transmitted to the downstream networks at times shorter than one @xmath6-cycle ( figure  [ figure3]c and figure  [ sfigure4 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the results shown on figure  [ figure3 ] typically do not extend to the @xmath6-timescale of @xmath50 .",

    "instead , they can be accumulated over an extended period .",
    "for physiological accuracy , we restrict this period to 10 mins or less , which results in a coactivity complex whose simplexes , or a cell assembly network whose cell assemblies , emerge over working memory intervals .",
    "although the algorithm of constructing temporal ech and the clique complexes seem quite different , the actual difference between these two coactivity complexes is not as significant .",
    "first , as shown in @xcite , most simplexes of @xmath76 correspond to the simplexes of @xmath5 and vice versa ( i.e. , the identities of the cell assemblies are largely the same , only the time course of their construction changes ) and the topological structures of these complexes are quite close .",
    "second , most pairwise connections within the cliques of @xmath82 are produced almost simultaneously while the rat traverses the region where several place fields overlap . in other words ,",
    "most cliques appear at once , just as the simplexes do , and only a relatively small number of the maximal cliques are actually  corrected \" over time @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this effect does improve the overall performance of the clique coactivity complexes , which typically produce much smaller numbers of spurious topological loops .",
    "this corresponds to a shorter learning times @xmath7 than the ech coactivity complexes .    implementing the @xmath6-synchronization mechanism in an integrator model yields the results illustrated in figure  [ figure4 ] .",

    "the behaviors of the topological loops in @xmath76 and in @xmath5 , shown in figures  [ figure3]b and figure  [ figure4]b are similar as well : the @xmath6-synchronization reduces the number of the cold spurious loops in both types of complexes ( figure  [ sfigure6 ] ) .",
    "physiologically , this implies that @xmath6-rhythm produces the same organizing effect on the activity of cell assembly network , whether the latter is based coincidence detector or on the input integrator readout neurons .",
