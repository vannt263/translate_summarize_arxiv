    "<S> two port s - matrix for a complex pt - symmetric potential may have uni - modular eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> if this happens for all energies , there occurs a perfect emission of waves at both ends . </S>",
    "<S> we call this phenomenon transparency which is distinctly different from coherent perfect absorption with or without lasing . using the versatile pt - symmetric complex scarf ii ( scattering ) potential , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate analytically that the transparency can occur regardless of whether pt - symmetry is unbroken or broken or if there are only scattering states . in these three cases , for a given value of the strength of the real part ; the strength of the imaginary part @xmath0 of the potential lies in @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> several other numerically solved potentials also support our findings .    starting with the handedness ( non - reciprocity ) [ 1 - 7 ] of reflection probability for left and right injection of waves at a complex potential , </S>",
    "<S> there have been very interesting developments in one - dimensional scattering from complex potentials . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena are spectral singularity [ 7,8 ] , coherent perfect absorption without [ 9 ] and with [ 10 ] lasing , uni - modular eigenvalues of s - matrix [ 11 ] , invisibility [ 12 ] , pseudo - unitarity [ 13 ] , anisotropic transmission resonances [ 13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these novel phenomena[7,14 ] have been proposed mostly based on very strong intuition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they occur as a possibility rather than a necessity in scattering from complex non - hermitain potentials / mediums . although at the time of their proposals , these effects appeared to occur more generally , later they were found to have interesting limitations .    </S>",
    "<S> for instance for complex non - hermitian potentials spectral singularity ( ss ) means a discrete positive energy at which both the transmission and reflection probabilities become infinite . </S>",
    "<S> it now turns out that ss does not [ 15 ] occur in the case of complex pt - symmetric potentials with unbroken pt - symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> coherent perfect absorption ( cpa ) without lasing was supposed to be the property of complex mediums and it has now been proved [ 15 ] that complex pt - symmetric potentials are exceptional in this regard . </S>",
    "<S> cpa with lasing [ 10 ] was claimed to be the property of pt - symmetric ( equal gain / loss ) mediums , later it has been found [ 11 ] to be a property of the domains of broken pt - symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the study and analysis of various models of complex pt - symmetric scattering potential like @xmath3 in the schrdinger equation @xmath4\\psi(x)=0,\\ ] ] becomes important and valuable . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are real , continuous , even and odd functions ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , respectively . these functions may also be piece - wise continuous as the rectangular profile in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 16 ) . in all the calculations in the text and in the appendix 1 , we use @xmath7 .    for the injection of two identical waves in all respects at a potential from left and right the s - matrix connecting the out - going and incoming waves is given as [ 11,13 ] : @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are transmission and reflection ( complex ) amplitudes and later we use @xmath11 and @xmath12 as real transmission and reflection coefficients ( probabilities ) . </S>",
    "<S> transmission amplitude is invariant of the side ( left / right ) of the incidence of the particle [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the complex eigenvalues of two - port @xmath13-matrix ( 6 ) are from @xmath14 as @xmath15 which becomes unimodular if [ 11,13 ] @xmath16 but whether this condition will be met in a some parametric domains of a given pt - symmetric potential of the type ( 1 ) requires calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic equation of this matrix is @xmath17 . according to caley - hamilton theorem the matrix @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> itself will satisfy this equation as @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> further since a @xmath19 matrix always satisfies a quadratic , we also have @xmath20 . on comparing the last two equations we get @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> then in view of the result that for pt - symmetric potentials we have @xmath22 [ 15 ] , two cases may arise . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , when one of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is @xmath25 and the other one @xmath26 . secondly , both the eigenvalues are uni - modular : @xmath27 , representing perfect emission of identically ( coherently ) injected beam of particles at both sides of the pt - symmetric potential .    for usual hermitian potentials we have @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a real trivial phase . </S>",
    "<S> hence both reciprocity of reflectivity and transparency are the property of hermitian potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of transparency to be investigated here contrasts with cpa with [ 10 ] and without [ 9 ] lasing . in the coherent scattering if @xmath30 spectral singularity is found at @xmath31 , @xmath32 where cpa alone occurs . if @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is arbitrarily small ) , cpa occurs with lasing at @xmath37 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> one of the eigenvalues of s - matrix diverges and the other one is zero [ 10,11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> to re - emphasize , for the transparency to occur the condition that @xmath38 has to be met for all real positive energies .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to remark that even for complex pt - symmetric scattering potentials ( such that , @xmath39 , the question as to whether or not this condition will be met in various domains requires computations and search . in this work , we report that the versatile exactly solvable scarf ii potential [ 2,17 ] is a special potential which helps in sorting out various parametric domains for transparency explicitly and analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that other numerically solved complex pt - symmetric potentials display similar results .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath40 and @xmath41 in ( 1 ) to write the complex pt - symmetric scarf ii potential as [ 2,17 - 21 ] @xmath42 and propose to discuss the occurrence of transparency in two domains : ( 1 ) when @xmath43 and @xmath44 , ( 2 ) when @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * ( 1 ) : @xmath43 and @xmath44 : + real discrete spectrum ( pt - symmetry is exact / unbroken ) * + pt - symmetry of a complex pt - symmetric potential is known to be exact ( unbroken ) [ 20 ] , if it has real discrete spectrum and the energy - eigenstates are also ( simultaneous ) eigenstates of joint operator pt : [ parity @xmath46 , time - reversal @xmath47.$ ] for ( 6 ) , two branches of real discrete energy eigenvalues are given as [ 18,21 ] @xmath48 where @xmath49/2 , ~ b=[\\sqrt{v_1 + |v_2|+1/4}-\\sqrt{v_1 -|v_2| + 1/4}]/2,\\ ] ] are real if @xmath50 [ 18 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath51 can now be called the exceptional point ( ep [ 22 ] ) of the potential ( 6 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we need to give the simplified expression of @xmath56 for this case . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath57 for real values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so it follows that transparency exists in the domain where the pt - symmetric potential has real discrete spectrum and pt - symmetry is exact ( unbroken ) . </S>",
