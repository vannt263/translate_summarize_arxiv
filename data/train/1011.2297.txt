    "the hcp solid phase for helium-4 is stable only above a minimum pressure @xmath1  bar at low temperature .",
    "recently it has been suggested @xcite that this solid phase remains metastable at much lower pressures .",
    "based on an extrapolation of the equation of state , the spinodal line is predicted to be at negative pressure , about -10  bar . beside testing this prediction , there is another interest to investigate solid helium at pressures below the melting pressure .",
    "vacancies in this quantum solid have been studied for a long time . in particular",
    "their energy @xmath2 has been measured at different pressures@xcite , and also computed by quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "although there is a significant scatter on the measured values of @xmath2 , it is striking that it is a strongly decreasing function of the molar volume @xmath3 .",
    "a simple linear extrapolation on the data gathered in reference @xcite suggests that an increase of @xmath3 by only 5% beyond the melting volume could bring @xmath2 near zero .",
    "although this is a large increase for a condensed phase , this is not so for solid helium which is a very compressible material .",
    "more precisely , the maximum molar volume for stable hcp helium-4@xcite is @xmath4  @xmath5 , the aimed value is @xmath6  @xmath5 , while the predicted value of @xmath3 at the spinodal line is @xmath7  @xmath5 .",
    "hence @xmath8 is within a possibly accessible range .",
    "if so , this would bring interesting new physics for solid helium . with @xmath2",
    "near zero , vacancies could proliferate , reach a sizable population , possibly undergo a bose - einstein condensation , thus realizing the andreev scenario for supersolidity@xcite . or",
    "if the vacancy - vacancy interaction is strong enough@xcite , it could provide another mechanism for destabilizing the solid phase before reaching @xmath9 .",
    "many different methods have been used to study metastable condensed phases , mostly liquid , under depression@xcite .",
    "metastability can not be easily obtained for a solid because the interfaces between a solid and the container walls are disordered , and generally nucleates the liquid phase .",
    "focused sound waves provide a way to circumvent this difficulty .",
    "starting from a pressure @xmath10 above @xmath11 , a sound pulse with an amplitude @xmath12 smaller than @xmath13 at the surface of the transducer will not bring the solid below the melting pressure at the transducer surface . on its propagation to the focus",
    "the sound pressure can be amplified by a large amount , namely @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , solid angle of the sound beam , @xmath16 transducer radius , @xmath17 sound wavelength ) .",
    "hence the peak pressure @xmath18 can explore the metastable domain below @xmath11 with negative @xmath12 .",
    "this article reports a first attempt to produce metastable hcp solid helium below its melting pressure .",
    "a hemispherical transducer was used to produce a converging sound wave .",
    "the density variations at focus are monitored by an optical interferometric method .",
    "the experimental arrangement is described in section 2 . because the sound velocity is anisotropic , the focusing is not expected to be perfect in hcp helium .",
    "a numerical simulation was made to model the remaining amplification in this case and to determine the relation between the optical signal and the density at focus .",
    "numerical predictions are discussed in section 3 .",
    "experimental results are reported and discussed in section 4 .",
    "possible improvements and conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "the experimental cell is a 4  cm stainless steel cube , with five silica windows ( diam",
    ". 2.5  cm ) , cooled from the top by a pumped helium-4 fridge in the 1.0 - 1.4  k temperature range . to achieve single crystal growth ,",
    "the nucleation and growth is made at constant temperature and pressure ( 1.2  k and 25.5  bar ) .",
    "an electro - crystallization device@xcite provides a unique seed which falls on the bottom of the cell .",
    "the crystal is subsequently grown from this seed .",
    "the orientation of the _ c-_facet ( most often horizontal ) is easily monitored visually during the growth process which takes place below the corresponding roughening transition 1.3  k @xcite .",
    "a hemispherical piezoelectric transducer of 6  mm internal radius ( from channel industries ) is suspended above the middle of the cell with its axis vertical , along the crystal _ c_-axis .",
    "such a transducer has two main resonant modes : the thickness mode frequency is @xmath19  mhz , the inner and outer surfaces vibrating in opposite directions .",
    "the breathing mode corresponds to an oscillation of the transducer radius and has a frequency @xmath20khz . in order to simplify as much as possible the pressure wave ,",
    "a single oscillation of the thickness mode was used .",
    "the driving voltage is produce by an arbitrary function generator and amplified by a rf amplifier up to a voltage ranging from 100  v to 800  v on 50  @xmath15 .",
    "the pulse shape is designed to leave the transducer at rest at the end of the pulse . beside the one - cycle oscillation at 1  mhz ,",
    "the exciting pulse also produces a parasitic oscillation of the low frequency breathing mode which appears after the end of the 1  mhz pulse .",
    "the sound velocity in hcp solid helium is anisotropic .",
    "for longitudinal waves , the velocity is about 540  m / s along the _ c_-axis and 460  m / s when the wave vector is in the basal plane@xcite .",
    "hence the initially spherical wave does not remain so and breaks up into two parts : one along the _",
    "c_-axis , named as @xmath21-pulse  hereafter , and another radial one , named @xmath22-pulse . both show a maximum amplitude near the center of the transducer .",
    "their relative intensity and shape will be discussed in the next section . in order to have an optical access to the transducer center two small notches ( 1  mm wide , 1.5  mm high )",
    "were made on the transducer rim , along a diameter .",
    "the phenomena at the focus are monitored optically .",

    "this linear approximation of the clausius - mossotti relation holds for helium with a relative error less than @xmath31 for @xmath32 up to 0.1 , well beyond the strains discussed here ( less than @xmath33 ) . because of the system cylindrical symmetry around the @xmath21-axis , @xmath34 and @xmath29 only depend on @xmath35 and @xmath21 . to measure @xmath36 ,",

    "@xmath36 contains a low frequency part @xmath37 due to the transducer breathing mode ( at @xmath38 ) , and the interesting signal @xmath39 due to the thickness oscillation ( at @xmath40 ) . to extract the latter from @xmath36 , a model of the low frequency signal",
    "@xmath41 has been constructed with two adjustable parameters : its amplitude @xmath42 and its starting time @xmath43 .",

    "a simpler method relies on numerical simulation to get the ratio @xmath52 and thus @xmath46 . in the following",
    ", results are discussed using the optical length variations @xmath53 as the signal instead of @xmath54 .",
    "since solid helium has a close - packed hexagonal structure ( hcp ) , its linear elastic properties are described by five elastic constants , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 as defined by musgrave@xcite .",

    "elastic waves are thus governed by two coupled second order differential equations for the only two possible components of the displacement vector , @xmath70 and @xmath71 : @xmath72 ( @xmath59 plays no role in this geometry )    special care must be taken in @xmath73 : for symmetry reasons , @xmath70 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 must be @xmath76 in @xmath73 . using the lhospital s rule , equation [ uzpp ]",
    "can be rewritten : @xmath77    these equations are integrated using a finite difference method and a staggered leap frog scheme with initial conditions corresponding to an undeformed crystal at rest .",
    "the model volume is @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( in mm ) and is discretized on a @xmath80 grid .",
    "the spatial step @xmath81 is then small enough compared to the wavelength ( @xmath82  mm ) that the dispersion introduced by the discretization is negligible .",
    "the time step @xmath83 is taken to be sufficiently small to fulfill the courant criterion : essentially one must have @xmath84 .",
    "at each time step @xmath85 one then calculates a new field of displacement vectors with the help of the above mentioned differential equations as a function of the fields at time @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the field is then adjusted so as to fulfill the boundary conditions : @xmath70 and @xmath71 are forced to be that of the transducer on the points belonging to it and @xmath88 is adjusted to the value @xmath89 to ensure cancelation of its derivative @xmath90 .",
    "the other boundaries are left free , giving rise to reflected waves , which arrive at the focus with a long enough delay to be of no concern . from the displacement vector field ,",

    "this is not much less than the factor 75 expected for an isotropic medium with the same @xmath93 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows the behavior of the optical length through the center of the transducer .",
    "a first striking result is that the optical length is vanishingly small for almost all times , although the integration path crosses the wave at any time .",
    "this is because the positive and the negative parts of the wave cancel almost exactly .",
    "only when the wave reaches the center is this no more true .",
    "the @xmath21-pulse seems to be magnified , but this is only a geometrical effect due to the fact that this part of the wave is almost plane and perpendicular to the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the optical length and the maximum amplitude of the index modulation is a characteristic length @xmath46 ( @xmath94  mm ) .",
    "it can be used to deduce the refractive index modulation , which is the quantity of interest , from the optical length , which is the measured quantity .",

    "an order of magnitude of the sound amplitude at the transducer surface can evaluated from the formula @xmath99 , where @xmath100  nm / v is the piezoelectric constant at room temperature of the transducer ceramic , and @xmath101 is an order of magnitude of its reduction factor at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "one finds @xmath102 , which can be converted to an acoustic pressure @xmath103  mbar using solid helium bulk modulus @xmath104  bar.@xcite .",
    "thus the minimum pressure at the transducer surface is well above the melting pressure .",
    "note that for low sound amplitudes ( @xmath105 ) , the computation of @xmath106 using the bulk modulus instead of a non linear equation of state does not lead to a relative error larger than @xmath33 .",
    "comparison of the optical signal with figure [ fig2]-b helps to identify the radial wave .",
    "the expected time of flight is indicated by the arrow labeled r - pulse .",
    "note that in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the origin of time is the beginning of the transducer oscillation . to get the time of flight for the middle of the sound pulse , half its duration is to be subtracted , namely 0.5@xmath25s .",
    "the sound velocity at this particular pressure is determined using the scaling of @xmath55 and @xmath58 proposed by maris@xcite . for this signal ,",
    "the laser beam is thought to cross the focal region .",
    "in fact extensive scanning of the focal region along the @xmath50 and @xmath21-axis with the laser beam was performed to locate the sound focus .",
    "the shape of the @xmath22-pulse is qualitatively similar to the expected one .",
    "the width in time measured by the delay between the secondary maximums is close to the 1.0  @xmath25s delay in figure [ fig2]-b .",
    "there are several differences however .",
    "some are parasitic effects .",
    "the high frequency modulation may be attributed to higher oscillation modes of the transducer which are found near 2.4  mhz and 3.6mhz .",
    "oscillations before the expected @xmath21-pulse can be explained by the fact that the reference light beam is slightly perturbed by the wave emitted by the rim of the piezo-hemisphere.the distance between this rim and the reference beam is 4  mm and thus the sound wave reaches it in 7  @xmath25s . concerning the @xmath22-pulse itself ,",
    "the ratio of the main peak amplitude to the secondary maximums is much smaller than in the simulation .",
    "this could be due to an offset of the laser beam from the radial geometry or spatial averaging over the laser waist .",
    "simulation shows that an offset of 0.1  mm would divide the peak by a factor 3 .",
    "there is not a clear evidence for the @xmath21-pulse .",
    "it is either absent or hidden by parasitic oscillations .",
    "its weakening may be correlated to that of the @xmath22-pulse peak .",
    "another possible explanation is that the initially well oriented mono - crystal has been broken and turned to a more or less isotropic polycrystal by the sound wave . as a matter of fact , during long measurement series for scanning the laser beam position , we occasionally observed evolution of the optical signal , generally a weakening of the pulse amplitude .",
    "let us come back to the intensity of the negative swing at focus . using the value of @xmath46 determined by the simulation ( @xmath107  mm ) ,",
    "one gets an order of magnitude of the negative pressure swing from the formula @xmath108  bar .",
    "the initial pressure was 0.6  bar from the melting pressure , so that the minimum pressure does not reach the melting line .",
    "figure [ fig3]-b shows another signal taken with a larger driving voltage ( 600 v ) and starting closer to the melting line , @xmath109  bar .",
    "the signal is clearly more distorted than in figure [ fig3]-a . if one converts nevertheless the negative swing into pressure using the same formula quoted above , one gets @xmath110  bar . in that case",
    ", it appears that the pressure has crossed the equilibrium melting line by at least 0.8  bar .",
    "has helium remained in the solid phase ? had a liquid droplet nucleated at the focus , it would have expanded for a fraction of the sound half period at a velocity close to the sound velocity .",
    "thus it would have reached a diameter on the order of 100  @xmath25 m . taking into account the refractive index difference between liquid and solid phases ( about 0.0035 )",
    ", the liquid bubble would have created a jump in @xmath111 as large as 0.35  @xmath25 m . also a large asymmetry would be found between positive and negative pressure swings .",
    "neither of the two phenomena are observed and it can be concluded that transient melting did not occur .",
    "a direct interferometric imaging has been developed @xcite to provide a map of @xmath112 .",
    "it uses the same interferometer , but the laser is a pulsed laser and the detector a ccd camera .",
    "images are taken for various @xmath85 and reference phases .",
    "then a map of @xmath113 can be computed for all the pixels in parallel . beside providing a direct image of the sound pulse propagation in the crystal",
    ", inverse abel transform will give access to the map of @xmath114 , provided that it has a cylindrical symmetry .",
    "this should overcome the major shortcoming in the present experiment , namely the conversion from the measured @xmath112 to the pressure swing @xmath106 at the focus .",
    "since the observed signal differs from the simulation , a more direct way to computed the latter will be valuable .",
    "it will also avoid scanning the laser beam to locate the focus , which is both time consuming and harmful for the crystal . in order to view the focus and an extended portion of the x - axis",
    ", the lower part of the hemispherical transducer will be shorten by 1  mm or so .",
    "this new method will also help assessing whether the crystal is broken by repetitive sound pulses .",
    "if this is the case , it would be of interest to try to work with a polycrystal with grains smaller than @xmath93",
    ". the medium will then be quasi - isotropic@xcite .",
    "whether the sound attenuation will be acceptable remains an open question . in the case",
    "monocrystals survive their repetitive stress , it would be more efficient to use a transducer with a shape conforming the wavesurface of the hcp crystal , or at least half of it . as depicted in reference",
    "@xcite , it is an elongated bowl , nearly conical in the directions between @xmath21 and @xmath50-axis . finally using longer multi - oscillation excitation pulses",
    "will allow to reach oscillation amplitudes @xmath106 about 10 times larger .",
    "the more complex wave pattern will not be a problem if inverse abel transform can be performed .    to summarize",
    ", it has been shown that interesting motivations exist to investigate solid helium below the melting pressure .",
    "numerical simulations confirmed that sound waves can be efficiently focused in the anisotropic hcp crystal and provides a tool to investigate the metastable region below the melting curve .",
    "a first example of incursion in this domain has been reported , and perspectives exist to enlarge the explored domain ."
