    "recently , a new nano  material in the form of a double gyroid has been synthesized @xcite .",
    "it is based on a thickened triply - periodic minimal surface , whose complement consists of two non - intersecting channels .",
    "these can be filled with conducting or semiconducting materials @xcite to function as nanowire networks with potentially useful electronic properties .",
    "the nontrivial topology of such a network has motivated our study of its commutative and non  commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "following bellissard and connes @xcite , we proceed by indentifying the relevant @xmath0algebra , which in our case is spanned by the symmetries and the tight - binding ( harper ) hamiltonian of the skeletal graph obtained as a deformation retract of the channel ; we call it the bellissard - harper algebra .",
    "this approach leads to an effective geometry described by a family of finite dimensional hamiltonians and their spectra ; the latter determine the band structure of the original nanostructured solid in the tight - binding approximation . by placing the material into an external constant magnetic field",
    "the geometry is rendered noncommutative .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize that setup to further noncommutative geometries obtained via certain quiver representations .",
    "we also adapt the techniques of @xcite and @xcite to this more general situation . in particular , in the commutative case",
    ", we get a classification of singularities in the spectrum  the band intersections .",
    "the simplest of these is a conical intersection of two bands , commonly referred to as a dirac point .",
    "we give analytic tools to compute locations and properties of the singular points .    in the general framework",
    "above , we also give a new interpretation of the berry phase phenomenon @xcite in terms of @xmath1theory and chern  classes generalizing the observations of thouless _",
    "et al . _ ( tknn ) @xcite and simon @xcite .",
    "these concepts include topological charges in various guises : scalar , @xmath1theoretic and cohomological .",
    "when the parameter space is three - dimensional , isolated conical degeneracies are magnetic monopoles in the parameter space @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the parameters are components of the crystal momentum @xmath2 ; their number equals the dimensionality of the original periodic structure .",
    "thus , in three spatial dimensions  the case of the gyroid ",
    "dirac points are monopoles in the momentum space and , as we will see , are stable with respect to small deformations of the graph hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , using foliations , we consider a slicing technique which leads to an effective numerical tool for finding singular points in the spectrum , generalizing the method used for this purpose in .",
    "this technique has been implemented in @xcite and corroborates the topological stability of the gyroid s dirac points .",
    "this stability is not a common characteristic of all dirac points : those of graphene , which is described by the honeycomb lattice , do not exhibit this property , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this fact has an elegant and short explanation in our approach .",
    "we expect that this analysis will contribute to understanding of potential applications of gyroid - based nanomaterials , as well as to the theory of three - dimensional generalizations of the quantum hall effect , along the lines of @xcite . in two dimensions , the tknn equations for generalized dirac ",
    "harper operators have been worked out in @xcite .",
    "analyses of higher - dimensional situations are contained in @xcite .    even without going to complete generality provided by quiver representations , our approach to studying wire networks",
    "is not restricted to the gyroid system and applies to any embedded periodic wire network in @xmath3 .",
    "we have already used it to study more examples , namely , bravais lattices , the honeycomb lattice and two other triply periodic surfaces and their wire networks , the primitive cubic ( p surface ) and the diamond ( d surface ) .",
    "we refer to these as the geometric examples .",
    "we recall some results here and include a new consideration of the topological charges . in these cases",
    "the noncommutative geometry is given by a subalgebra of a matrix algebra with coefficients in the noncommutative torus .",
    "here the parameters of the torus correspond to the @xmath4field that the material is subjected to .",
    "one surprising fact is that some properties of the non  commutative situation are similar to the situation without a magnetic field , and there is evidence for duality between these two situations .",
    "the duality concerns the degenerate subspaces of the torus that appears as the relevant moduli space in both cases . in the commutative case , i.e. in the absence of a magnetic field , the torus is the base for the family of hamiltonians and the requsite subspace is where the spectrum of the hamiltonian has degeneracies . in the noncommutative case ,",
    "the same torus parameterizes the @xmath4field and the locus of degeneracy is that of those values of @xmath4 where the bellissard  harper algebra is not the full matrix algebra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with a description of the material and its underlying geometry in chapter 2 . here the geometry is reduced to that of the skeletal graph ",
    "the deformation retract of a channel component of the complement to the triply periodic surface .",
    "we also introduce other related geometries which we consider in parallel .",
    "these are the honeycomb lattice underlying graphene , and the p and d surfaces , which are the other triply periodic self  symmetric surfaces .",
    "chapter 3 describes the mathematical model we work with .",
    "this includes the harper hamiltonian and the relevant hilbert space and @xmath0 algebra , the bellissard  harper algebra .",
    "we discuss the @xmath0 geometry in chapter 4 .",
    "this includes our analysis of the berry connection , topological charges and stability of the singular points as well as a slicing method to detect singular points or monopoles .",
    "chapter 5 contains our results about degeneracies in the spectrum of the harper hamiltonian in the commutative case using singularity and representation theories . in chapter 6",
    "we summarize the results of our analysis for the cases mentioned above including the new results about the topological charges .",
    "we finish this chapter and the paper with a conjecture about a commutative / non  commutative duality and remarks about approaching it .",
    "the gyroid is a triply periodic constant mean curvature surface that is embedded in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a picture of the gyroid .",
    "it was discovered in 1970 by alan schoen @xcite .",
    "a single gyroid has symmetry group @xmath6 in hermann - maguin notation . here",
    "the letter @xmath7 stands for bcc .",

    "polymers @xcite .",
    "the * double gyroid * consists of two mutually non  intersecting embedded gyroids .",
    "its symmetry group is @xmath9 where the extra symmetry comes from interchanging the two gyroids .",
    "it also has a level surface approximation which is given by the above expression ( [ level ] ) with @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",

    ". we will denote by @xmath15 the double gyroid surface .",
    "its complement @xmath16 has three connected components , which we will call @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath18 can be thought of as a `` thickened '' ( fat ) surface which we will refer to as dg wall .",
    "there is a deformation retract of @xmath18 onto a single gyroid .",
    "there are also two channel systems @xmath13 and @xmath14 , shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "these channels form y - junctions where three channels meet under a @xmath19 degree angle .",
    "each of these channel systems can be deformation retracted to a skeletal graph @xmath20 .",
    "we will concentrate on one of these channels and its skeletal graph @xmath21 , shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "a solid - state double gyroid can be synthesized by self - assembly at the nanoscale , as demonstrated by urade et al . @xcite .",
    "the first step is production of a nanoporous silica film with the structure of unidirectionally cotracted double gyroid ( dg ) with lattice constant of about 18 nm . the pores in the structure can then be filled with other materials to form nanowires .",
    "fabrication of platinum dg nanowires by electrodeposition has been demonstrated in @xcite , where it has also been mentioned that the process can be used for other metals or semiconductors .",
    "there are two other triply periodic self  dual and symmetric cmc surfaces- the cubic ( p ) and the diamond ( d ) network .",
    "they are shown in figure [ fig3 ] together with their wire networks obtained in the same way as for the gyroid . here",
    "we summarize the results from @xcite .",
    "the p surface has a complement which has two connected components each of which can be retracted to the simple cubical graph whose vertices are the integer lattice @xmath22 .",
    "the translational group is @xmath23 in this embedding , so it reduces to the case of a bravais lattice .",
    "the d surface has a complement consisting of two channels each of which can be retracted to the diamond lattice @xmath24 .",
    "the diamond lattice is given by two copies of the fcc lattice , where the second fcc is the shift by @xmath25 of the standard fcc lattice , see figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "graphene consists of one - atom thick planar sheets of carbon atoms that are densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice .",
    "this two  dimensional material has attracted much interest recently , partially because of the existence of dirac points where excitations show a linear dispersion relation .",
    "its electronic properties are described by a harper hamiltonian : see the review @xcite and references therein . here",
    "we will reproduce some of the known facts , such as the dirac points using our non  commutative geometry machine .",
    "we will now describe how to obtain the harper hamiltonian for any given graph @xmath27 with a given maximal translation group @xmath28 @xcite",
    ". we will start with the commutative case without an external field , and then progress to non  commutative case where the graph is placed in a constant external magnetic field . the mathematical set  up",
    "we will describe below can be understood in terms of weyl quantization and peierls substitution in physics @xcite . without the magnetic field",
    "the harper hamiltonian is given by translations , but in the presence of a magnetic field all translations turn into magnetic translations or wannier operators , which cease to commute with each other .",
    "mathematically the discretization by the above process yields the hilbert space @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the vertices of @xmath31 , and a projective representation of the translation group @xmath32 as well as an operator @xmath33 , the harper hamiltonian . concretely , the elements @xmath34 of @xmath32 act on the functions @xmath35 via the usual translations @xmath36 .      in general , given a embedded graph @xmath27 , with a given maximal translation group @xmath28",
    ", we consider the quotient graph @xmath37 and the projection @xmath38 .",
    "the quotient graphs for our four main examples are given in figure [ quotientgraphs ] .",
    "the vertices of this graph are in 11 correspondence with vertices or sites of @xmath31 in a fundamental cell .",
    "we can think of the graph @xmath39 as embedded into @xmath40 .",
    "each edge @xmath41 of @xmath42 lifts to a pair of edge vectors @xmath43 where the underlying line segment is any lift of @xmath41 to @xmath31 .",
    "this is well defined since any two lifts differ by a translation .",
    "to each vertex @xmath44 we can associate the hilbert space @xmath45 .",
    "then the whole hilbert space @xmath46 decomposes as @xmath47 since all the @xmath48 are separable hilbert spaces , they are all isomorphic .    the harper hamiltonian is then given as follows .",
    "for each edge @xmath41 between two vertices @xmath49 and @xmath50 of @xmath51 let @xmath52 be the translation operator from @xmath53 .",
    "this extends to an operator @xmath54 on @xmath46 via @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the inclusion and @xmath57 is the projection .",
    "the harper hamiltonian is @xmath58      adding a constant magnetic field requires a slightly different definition of the harper hamiltonian .",
    "we will use projective translation operators whose commutators include the fluxes of the magnetic field as follows : we define a 2cocycle @xmath59 by a two ",
    "form @xmath60 .",
    "such a two  form is given by a skew symmetric matrix @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "we let @xmath63 where @xmath4 is the norm of the magnetic field . in this way",
    "we obtain a two ",
    "cocycle @xmath64 : @xmath65 .",
    "we define magnetic translations by starting from @xmath66 , which is a potential for @xmath4 ( on @xmath3 ) .",
    "the magnetic translation partial isometry is now acting on a wave function as @xmath67    the magnetic harper operator is defined as @xmath68      in the setting above , which we call the geometric examples , we have distilled the following data : a finite graph @xmath51 , the translational groups @xmath32 and a projective representation of it on @xmath69 and finally the hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "we will now explore the possibility of obtaining such data from a more general setup .",
    "there are two ways to do this : in terms of groupoids or in terms of quivers .",
    "recall that a groupoid is a category whose morphisms are all invertible .",
    "a representation of a groupoid is a functor from this category into a linear category . in our case",
    "this will be the category of separable hilbert spaces which is the full subcategory of the category of vector spaces whose objects are separable hilbert spaces .",
    "a graph @xmath51 ( here @xmath51 need not be finite ) determines a groupoid @xmath70 as follows .",
    "the objects are the vertices of @xmath71 .",
    "the morphisms are _ generated _ by the edges .",
    "that is for each oriented edge between @xmath49 and @xmath50 there is one generator @xmath72 in @xmath73 .",
    "the morphisms in this category are then the composable words in the @xmath72 where composable means that the source of a letter is the target of the predecessor , with the relations that @xmath74 what this means is that the morphisms are the paths on @xmath71 up to homotopy , with the constant path yielding the identity .    a groupoid representation of @xmath70 it in separable hilbert spaces then assigns to each vertex @xmath49 of @xmath51 a separable hilbert space @xmath48 and to each oriented edge @xmath75 from @xmath49 to @xmath50 a morphism @xmath76 with the relation that @xmath77 .",
    "the groupoid representation is unitary if all the @xmath78 are .",
    "notice that there is an involution @xmath79 on the morphisms , by transposing the word and reversing the orientation of each letter .",
    "so we can only look at involutive functors , that is functors which send @xmath79 to @xmath80 , which guarantees that the representation is unitary .      there is a way to formulate this in quiver language . given a graph @xmath51 and an arbitrary choice of directions for the edges",
    "determines a quiver .",
    "now one can construct the double of the quiver , where each oriented edge is doubled with reverse orientation . if we started from a graph , this means that each unoriented edge @xmath41 is replaced by the two oriented edges @xmath75 and @xmath81 .",
    "now the double of the quiver is independent of the original choice of orientation .",
    "it also has an involution on @xmath79 the set of its edges which is given by reversing orientation .",
    "the quiver representations we are looking at are those where @xmath79 goes to @xmath80 .",
    "just as above we define    @xmath82      if we fix a vertex @xmath84 of @xmath31 the groupoid representation naturally gives a representation of @xmath83 as follows .",
    "fix a set of generators of @xmath85 is the free group in @xmath86 generators .",
    "each such generator @xmath87 is a directed simple loop on the graph which is given by a sequence of directed edges @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath89 gives a representation of @xmath90 on @xmath91 .",
    "we will denote the algebra generated by @xmath92 by @xmath93 .",
    "we say the @xmath94 is maximal if the generators of @xmath95 map to linearly independent operators and that @xmath94 is of torus type if @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath94 is of torus type then @xmath94 is a projective representation of @xmath97 , the abelianization of @xmath95 .",
    "these are of a special type , namely those whose co  cycle is given by a constant @xmath4 field as discussed in @xcite .    in the geometric situation of chapters 3.13.3 ,",
    "maximality is equivalent to the fact that the translational symmetry group is maximal .",
    "if we pick a rooted spanning tree of @xmath51 then we get isomorphisms @xmath98 by using @xmath94 and concatenation along the unique shortest path of oriented edges from @xmath84 to @xmath49 in the spanning tree .",
    "let @xmath99 then this isomorphisms yields a representation @xmath100 on @xmath101 via pullback .",
    "likewise @xmath102 induces an isomorphism of @xmath103 and @xmath90 . using this identification , we get an representation @xmath104 of @xmath105 on @xmath46 and via pull - back with @xmath106 on @xmath101 .",
    "a rooted spanning tree @xmath107 also gives rise to one more bijection .",
    "this is between a set of ( symmetric ) generators of @xmath95 and the edges _ not _ in the spanning tree .",
    "the bijection is as follows .",
    "if @xmath75 is a directed edge from @xmath49 to @xmath50 then there is a generator @xmath108 which is given by the following path of ordered edges : ( 1 ) the unique shortest path in @xmath109 from @xmath84 to @xmath49 ( 2 ) @xmath75 and ( 3 ) the unique shortest path in @xmath109 from @xmath50 to @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath110 . by contracting the spanning tree",
    ", we see that this is indeed a set of symmetric but otherwise independent generators .    for convenience ,",
    "we set @xmath111 if @xmath112 .      given a groupoid representation in separable hilbert spaces of a finite graph @xmath51 we call the @xmath0 algebra generated by the operators @xmath33 and @xmath105 via @xmath104 on @xmath46 the bellissard ",
    "harper algebra of the pair @xmath113 and denote it by @xmath114 .",
    "this general set gives the generalization of one of the results of @xcite .",
    "any choice of spanning tree together with an order on the vertices gives rise to a faithful matrix representation of @xmath114 in @xmath115 .",
    "this follows from the fact that under @xmath106 , @xmath116 gets transformed to the matrix entry @xmath117 between the copies of @xmath91 corresponding to @xmath118 and @xmath119 under @xmath106 .",
    "enumerating these vertices yields a matrix .",
    "in the following given a rooted spanning tree @xmath109 we will only choose orders @xmath120 such that the root is the first element .",
    "the resulting matrix hamiltonian will be denoted by @xmath121 .",
    "the non  commutative geometry of such a quiver representation in general and the one stemming from the geometric situation in particular is that of @xmath114 .    just like in @xcite one",
    "can now ask the question whether or not @xmath114 is isomorphic to the full matrix algebra and hence morita equivalent to @xmath105 itself . in the geometric case",
    "@xmath122 is generically simple and led to the expectation which we proved in @xcite that generically @xmath123 .",
    "this of course need not be the case in general .",
    "it stands to reason that other more complicated physical phenomena could be described by such algebras .",
    "it actually turns out that in the geometric examples not only is the algebra indeed the full matrix algebra at irrational parameter values , but that there are even only finitely many or a dimension@xmath124 subset of rational matrix parameters @xmath60 , where @xmath125 .",
    "@xcite for the geometric cases of the g surface and the honeycomb lattice the bellissard ",
    "harper algebra is the full matrix algebra except at finitely many values of @xmath60 given in chapter 6 . for the p surface and all bravais lattices @xmath126 . for the @xmath127 surface , the set of values of @xmath60 for which @xmath128 is given by 6 one dimensional families and finitely many special points ( also listed in chapter 6 ) .",
    "if @xmath129 is the full matrix algebra then it is morita equivalent to @xmath130 .",
    "note that except for the p and general bravais case , these families above give examples of continuos variations of algebras whose @xmath1theory does not vary continuously .",
    "one application of the non  commutative approach is gap labeling by @xmath1theory . if the hamiltonian @xmath33 has spectrum bounded from below , then each gap in the spectrum gives rise to a projector @xmath131 onto the eigenspaces with eigenvalues less than any fixed value @xmath132 in the gap , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the gap labeling then associates the @xmath1theory class of @xmath131 to the gap .    by the above result , via the inclusion @xmath133 the projector @xmath131 also gives rise to a @xmath1theory class in @xmath134 . using this embedding , one can deduce analogues of the famous hofstadter butterfly .",
    "if @xmath113 is toric non  degenerate , then the hamiltonian @xmath33 as an operator on @xmath46 has only finitely many gaps if the magnetic field is rational in the sense that the matrix @xmath60 is rational .",

    "the space corresponding to this algebra is simply @xmath151 @xmath150times .    since after choosing an order and a rooted spanning tree @xmath152 , we can lift any character @xmath140 of @xmath105 to a @xmath0-homomorphism : @xmath153 of @xmath114 by applying @xmath140 to each entry .",
    "we call a point @xmath140 of @xmath143 degenerate if @xmath154 has less than @xmath155 distinct eigenvalues .    repeating the proof of @xcite we arrive at the following    if @xmath156 is maximal the map @xmath157 is ramified over the degenerate points and",
    "furthermore @xmath136 is the quotient of the trivial cover @xmath158 where the identifications are made in the fibers over degenerate points and moreover these correspond to the degeneracies of @xmath33 over these points .    in other words",

    "it was berry s insight that this connection is indeed not always trivial and produces the so  called berry phase as a possible monodromy .",

    "there are several ways to get a scalar charge which one can exploit .",
    "since the chern classes have even degree , they will always produce zero when paired with odd dimensional homology classes .",

    "technically the representation of stabilizer subgroupoid factors through the group given by identification of all objects in that groupoid to one point .    in order to find such a stabilizer group , we look for an automorphism of @xmath143 which compensates the re  gauging by automorphisms of @xmath51 .",

    "the upshot is that the isotypical decomposition of the representation has to be commensurate with the eigenspace decomposition of the hamiltonian  for that particular value @xmath324 .",

    "first and foremost , there is agreement on the maximal dimension of the degenerate locus in @xmath343 between the commutative and the non  commutative case . in the commutative case , this locus is @xmath348 ; in the non  commutative case , it is the values of the @xmath4field , which is again parameterized by @xmath343 , now via @xmath60 , where the matrix algebra is not the full matrix algebra .",
    "we conjecture that this is always the case .",
    "there are several possible points of attack here .",
    "the first is through the symmetries : as we have seen , the re  gauging groupoid exists already in the non  commutative case .",
    "another is to consider how , in the presence of a conserved topological charge , larger representations , such as @xmath385 in the gyroid case , break into smaller pieces . using the slicing method described above",
    ", one can readily see how that happens under a deformation of the hamiltonian in the commutative case .",
    "the question is whether the effect of non - commutativity is something similar .",
