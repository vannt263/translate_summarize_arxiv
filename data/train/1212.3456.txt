    "_ convex geometries _ are combinatorial structures : finite sets with anti - exchange closures such that the emptyset is closed .",
    "they are equivalent to antimatroids , which are particular greedoids , and also to meet - distributive lattices . actually , the concept of convex geometries has many equivalent variants .",
    "the first of these variants is due to dilworth @xcite , and the early ones were surveyed in monjardet @xcite .",
    "since it would wander to far if we overviewed the rest , more than a dozen approaches , we only mention adaricheva @xcite , abels @xcite , caspard and monjardet @xcite , avann @xcite , jamison - waldner @xcite , and ward @xcite for additional sources , and stern  @xcite , adaricheva and czdli @xcite , and czdli @xcite for some recent overviews . however , we need only a small part of the theory of convex geometries , and the present paper is intended to be self - contained for those who know the rudiments of lattice theory up to , say , the concept of semimodularity .    from combinatorial point of view",
    ", the finite convex geometries are the interesting ones . hence , and also because the tools we use are elaborated only for the finite case , the present paper is restricted to _ finite _ convex geometries . postponing the exact definition of convex geometries to section  [ secketto ] , we present an important finite example as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 be a finite subset of the @xmath3-dimensional space @xmath4 .",
    "the set of all subsets of @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath5 . for @xmath6 , we define @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the usual convex hull of @xmath9 in @xmath4 .",
    "map @xmath10 is a closure operator , and @xmath11 is a finite convex geometry .",
    "convex geometries of this form are called _ geometries of relatively convex sets _ , and they ( not only the finite ones ) were studied by adaricheva @xcite and @xcite , bergman @xcite , and huhn @xcite .",
    "we know from bergman @xcite that each finite convex geometry @xmath12 can be into a geometry @xmath11 of relative convex sets ; @xmath3 depends on @xmath12 .",
    "however , even if a finite convex geometry is of convex dimension 2 , it is not necessarily isomorphic to some @xmath11 .",
    "we start from a finite set @xmath0 of circles in the plane @xmath13 , and we define a convex geometry @xmath14 with the help of forming usual convex hulls in the plane , analogously to the geometries of relative convex sets .",
    "the structures @xmath14 , called _ convex geometries of circles _ , are very close to the usual closure @xmath15 and , as opposed to geometries of relatively convex sets , we can prove that each finite convex geometry of convex dimension at most 2 is isomorphic to some convex geometry @xmath14 of circles . actually , our representation theorem , the main result of the paper , will assert more by imposing some conditions on @xmath0 ; see figure  [ fig1 ] ( without @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the grey - colored plane shape @xmath18 , and the dotted curves ) for a first impression .     until the proof of lemma  [ fromtolemma ] ) [ fig1 ] ]    this paper uses some lattices as auxiliary tools in proving the main result .",

    "even if only a part of the results in these papers are eventually needed here , this progress provides the background of the present work . on the other hand , some auxiliary statements we prove here ,",
    "namely some of the propositions , seem to be of some interest in the theory of slim semimodular lattices , while some other propositions could be interesting in the theory of convex geometries .",
    "section  [ secketto ] gives the basic concepts and formulates two results .",
    "proposition  [ prop1 ] asserts that , for every finite set @xmath0 of circles in the , @xmath14 is a convex geometry , while our main result , theorem  [ thmmain ] , is the converse statement for the case of convex dimension @xmath19 .",
    "the results of section  [ secketto ] are proved in section  [ proofsection ] , where several auxiliary statements are cited or proved , and some more concepts are recalled .",
    "section  [ oddsendch ] contains examples , statements , and open problems to indicate that although theorem  [ thmmain ] gives a satisfactory representation of finite convex geometries of convex dimension at most 2 , we are far from settling the case of higher convex dimensions .",
    "as mentioned already , the reader is only assumed a little knowledge of lattices .",
    "besides the first few pages of any book on lattices or particular lattices , including grtzer @xcite , nation @xcite , and stern @xcite , even the first chapter of burris and sankappanavar @xcite , which does not even focus on lattice theory , is sufficient . note that @xcite and @xcite are freely downloadable",
