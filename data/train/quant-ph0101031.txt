    "the quantum zeno paradox ( qzp ) is a proposition that evolution of a quantum system is stopped if the state of system is continuously measured by a macroscopic device to check whether the system is still in its initial state @xcite .",
    "qzp is a consequence of formal application of von neumann s projection postulate to represent a continuous measurement as a sequence of infinitely frequent instantaneous collapses of system s wave function .",
    "it was shown theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that sufficiently frequent discrete active measurements of system s state really inhibit quantum evolution .",
    "this phenomenon was named ` quantum zeno effect ' ( qze ) .",
    "but the question about possibility of qze during _ true continuous _ observations is not quite clear up to now .",
    "a true continuous measurement of quantum system s state takes place during observation of spontaneous decay by distant detector of emitted particles ( another examples of continuous measurement of decay are presented in papers @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a metastable exited atom surrounded for detectors to register an emitted photon ( or electron ) when the exited state of atom decays to the ground state .",
    "while the detectors are not discharged , the information that the atom is in its exited state is being obtained permanently , therefore the system s state is being measured continuously .",
    "could the presence of detectors influence on the decay constant of exited atom ?",
    "if so , this would be the qze in true continuous passive measurement .",
    "it is impossible to describe this kind of continuous measurement by a sequence of discrete wave function collapses as was proposed in seminal works @xcite .",
    "such approach leads to the explicit quantum zeno paradox , not effect . instead",
    ", a dynamical description of such measurements was elaborated in the number of works @xcite . in this approach object system ( atom ) , radiation field ( or emitted particle ) , and device ( detector of particle ) are considered as subsystems of one compound quantum system . the results of papers @xcite were mainly qualitative . the explicit expression for decay",
    "constant perturbed by given interaction @xmath0 of emitted particles with detector was obtained in @xcite .",
    "this expression is @xmath1 in eq.([eq1 ] ) @xmath2 is the sum of all transition matrix element squares related to the same energy of emitted particle @xmath3 ; @xmath4 is the expectation value of final energy of emitted particle .",
    "the function @xmath5 describes the influence of observation on the decay constant . without detector , i.  e.  @xmath6",
    ", the function @xmath5 transforms to dirac s delta - function @xmath7 and eq.([eq1 ] ) transforms to the golden rule @xcite .",
    "it was supposed @xcite that the meaning of @xmath5 is an energy spreading of the final states of decay due to time - energy uncertainty relation and finite time - life of emitted particle until scattering on the detector .",
    "then one can suggest that observation influences on decay in accordance with the following sequence : the faster detector , the shorter emitted particle time - life , the wider @xmath5 , the stronger perturbation of decay constant .",
    "it is clear that strong interactions @xmath0 is needed to obtain qze .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is essentially nonperturbative in this problem .",
    "this feature determines the main difficulty of calculations of function @xmath5 in eq.([eq1 ] ) and , consequently , the perturbed value of decay constant .",
    "particularly , in paper @xcite we supposed that qze explains strong inhibition of 76ev - nuclear uranium-235 isomer decay in matrix of silver @xcite . however , we had to restrict the consideration only by a qualitative analysis of eq.([eq1 ] ) for this case because of difficulties of function @xmath8 calculations .    since it is difficult to study realistic physical systems , it is reasonable to start with some simplified models to calculate the function @xmath9 .",
    "the aim of the present paper is strict and complete numerical investigation of eq.([eq1 ] ) for a simple but not oversimplified model system .",
    "we derive eq.([eq1 ] ) , then introduce one - dimensional three - particle model of continuous observation of decay , then describe the numerical computation scheme for this model , and finally discuss results of calculations .",
    "in this section a derivation of eq.([eq1 ] ) and other formulae to construct our numerical model are presented .",
    "derivation of eq.([eq1 ] ) is simplified in comparison with our previous papers @xcite .",
    "let a compound system @xmath10 consists of three subsystems @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) means that the hilbert space of system @xmath14 is a direct product of spaces of systems @xmath15 . ] .",
    "the system @xmath11 ( `` atom '' ) decays spontaneously from the initial exited state @xmath16 to the ground state @xmath17 emitting a particle @xmath12 ( `` electron '' ) due to interaction @xmath18 between systems @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this process is similar to autoionization decay of excited atomic state , but it is possible to suppose another nature of systems and interactions .",
    "the particle @xmath12 is initially at the ground state @xmath19 ( electron is on the bounded state in atom ) and then transits to continuum @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the energy of the state in the continuum and @xmath22 represents all other quantum numbers .",
    "particle @xmath12 inelastically scatters on third system @xmath13 ( `` distant detector '' ) due to interaction @xmath0 between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . as a result ,",
    "the system @xmath13 transits from the initial ground state @xmath23 to the continuum @xmath24 . this transition is considered to be a registration of decay .",
    "we consider that the interaction @xmath18 does not effect on system @xmath13 , the interaction @xmath0 does not effect on system @xmath11 and the systems @xmath12 and @xmath13 do nt interact in their ground states .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are unit operators in the hilbert spaces of corresponding systems .",
    "the hamiltonian of whole system is @xmath28 where @xmath29 with obvious notations .",
    "the initial state of system @xmath14 at the initial moment of time @xmath30 is @xmath31 let us introduce the first order correction to the eigenenergy of state @xmath32 due to interaction @xmath18 : @xmath33 and renormalized unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath34 and renormalized interaction @xmath18 : @xmath35 then the hamiltonian eq.([eq3 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath36 the initial state @xmath32 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath37 with the eigenenergy @xmath38    the interaction @xmath18 is considered to be a small perturbation , but interaction @xmath0 is not small . to obtain the decay constant of the exited state @xmath16 it is necessary to solve the shrdinger equation for the whole system @xmath14 .",
    "it is impossible to construct the perturbation theory for @xmath0 , but it is possible for @xmath18 .",

    "we can not obtain an explicit analytical expression for @xmath55 with respect to the matrix elements of interaction @xmath0 due to nonperturbative character of this interaction .",
    "however , it is possible to derive an interesting qualitative conclusion on the shape of function @xmath56 ( which is essentially used to calculate @xmath55 ) without calculations . for simplicity",
    "we suppose @xmath57 to be a step - like function with the jump at energy @xmath58 .",
    "suppose the energy - spreading function @xmath56 be a bell - like and nearly symmetric with the maximum at @xmath59 .",
    "consider the case @xmath60 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "then the transition @xmath61 with emitting of particle @xmath12 is strictly forbidden by the energy conservation law . for example , the binding energy of atomic electron is greater than the transition energy @xmath62 and the electron can not be ionized during this transition .",
    "but the functions @xmath63 and @xmath57 may have no - zero overlap integral eq.([eq19 ] ) as is shown on fig.[fig2 ] . hence @xmath64 and",
    "the transition latexmath:[$|x_e\\rangle \\to    contradiction means that the suggestion about shape of function @xmath56 was wrong .",
    "the contradiction could be eliminated if whole no - zero part of function @xmath56 locates at the left - hand side of point @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we conclude , that our formalisms predict this special shape for the function @xmath56 . another prediction is the following .",

    "this is a consequence of @xmath155 .",
    "namely this lowest energy part of wave packet determines the value of inner product in the rhs of eq.([eq32 ] ) and , consequently , behavior of @xmath92 .",
    "but this lowest energy part of wave packet can not influence on the state of system @xmath13 due to a short range of interaction @xmath156 and large length of distance @xmath112 ( fig.[fig3 ] ) . as a result",
    "there is no influence of system @xmath13 excitation to the behavior of function @xmath92 .",
    "oscillations of @xmath92 ( fig.[fig5 ] ) is appeared to be a result of elastic reflection of particle @xmath12 from the particle @xmath13 in its ground state @xmath23 .",
    "thus , our conclusions are as follows .",
    "firstly , the functions @xmath56 and @xmath92 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq19],[eq22 ] ) have no any simple physical sense in the context of problem of continuous observation of decay by distant detector .",
    "generally , the function @xmath92 does not mean the survival of the final state of decay with time generally , and the function @xmath56 does not mean the energy spreading of decay final states .",
    "secondly , there is no quantum zeno effect during the continuous observation of spontaneous decay by distant detector if interaction between emitted particle and detector is short - range and the emitted particle has no - zero mass .",
    "thirdly , zeno effect in the context of the same problem takes place if the interaction between emitted particle and detector is long - range , but this situation is considered as unrealistic .",
    "finally , we did not consider the case of `` spreaded '' detector , when the detector is represented by some medium which contains a decay system and we did not consider the case of massless emitted particles .",
