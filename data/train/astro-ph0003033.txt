    "m dwarfs are among the faintest and coolest stellar objects . their optical spectra are dominated by molecular band absorption .",
    "the major opacity sources in the optical regions are tio and vo bands , which produce a pseudo - continuum with the atomic lines superposed .",
    "recent surveys ( e.g. denis , 2mass ) have turned up even cooler objects , including brown dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optical spectra of these objects are still characterized by molecular band absorption ; however , the tio and vo bands , which constitute the defining characteristic of the m spectral class , become very weak or are absent , while the metal hydrides begin to dominate .",
    "this is presumably because of the depletion of heavy elements in their cool photospheres through the formation ( and perhaps subsequent gravitational settling ) of dust grains , especially solid vo and perovskite ( catio@xmath1 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for this reason , a new spectral class , `",
    "l ' , has been proposed for these very cool low - mass objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to understand these very cool , low mass stellar and substellar objects , it is necessary to assign to them an effective temperature scale .",
    "the construction of sequences has been attempted in recent years by comparing the spectra of these objects to synthetic ones generated by atmospheric models .",
    "comparisons have been made on the basis of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and infrared colors ( @xcite ) .",
    "attempts have also been made to construct a temperature scale using the molecular lines in the observed spectra , since these are sensitive to photospheric temperature .",
    "@xcite do this in the optical by ranking the objects in order of tio , vo , crh and feh equivalent widths ; @xcite pursue a similar program in the infrared by using h@xmath2o indices .",
    "@xcite do so with a spectral color index based on moderate dispersion spectroscopy in the k band . @xcite",
    "have performed a detailed analysis of low dispersion optical spectra as a first step towards defining the subclasses of the l spectral type .",
    "it is found that the models fit the observed seds and colors fairly well overall , and an effective temperature sequence is indeed derivable from the fits .",
    "however , as decreases from early to late spectral types , some molecular bands which comprise most of the low resolution spectral features of these cool objects first increase and then decrease in strength due to dust formation ( both through depletion from the gas phase and heating effects ) .",
    "the broadband infrared color indices ( eg .",
    "j - k or i - k ) saturate at very cool temperatures , and eventually also reverse direction ( though it seems that i - z or i - j might be monotonic with temperature ) .",
    "the molecular line lists in the models are not fully satisfactory , which could affect the temperature scale .",
    "it is therefore useful to have an alternative and complementary way of estimating effective temperatures .",
    "we present such a method here : fitting synthetic spectra to the profiles of strong atomic alkali lines .",
    "their extremely low ionization potential allows the alkali metals ( li , na , k , cs and rb ) to remain neutral only at temperatures below 3000k . more importantly , their atomic resonance lines occur in the red and are thus prominent in very cool photospheres , displaying deep cores and broad wings in high - resolution spectra . finally and most importantly , the alkali metals are relatively undepleted by dust formation ( @xcite ) , and their resonance lines are apparently formed in photospheric layers located above the region affected most by dust . for these reasons ,",
    "the resonance features of the alkali metals are excellent temperature indicators in cool photospheres , and grow monotonically in strength with decreasing temperature in the range of interest .",
    "we therefore attempt to assign effective temperatures to 17 late - m and l dwarfs by fitting model spectra to their and high - resolution line - profiles .    in principle",
    ", the and lines can be also be used for this purpose .",
    "however , we have not considered them in this paper , for the following reasons .",
    "the line in some of our sample objects is very broad , extending beyond one whole echelle order . to fit models to it",
    ", neighboring orders must be patched together , a task fraught with sources of error and thus considered too risky for the fine - analysis we undertake here .",
    "we also do not have observations of the lines for a number of our sample objects .",
    "therefore , we consider only the and lines in this paper .",
    "we should point out that this method has its own weak points .",
    "the treatment of dust , or of the background molecular opacities around the lines , do influence the apparent strength of the line by changing the nearby continuum . while it is unlikely that the molecular opacities are wildly off ,",
    "we show that dust can have a major effect .",
    "the synthetic spectra we use are generated by the atmospheric models of allard and hauschildt ( hereafter ah ) .",
    "the models come with 3 treatments : `` standard ( no - dust ) '' , `` dusty '' and `` cleared - dust '' ( discussed in  3 ) . the first does not account for dust formation at all , while the second takes dust formation into account by considering both dust grain opacities and photospheric depletion of dust - forming elements ( physically , this implies a haze of dust that is mixed throughout the atmosphere ) .",
    "the third ignores dust opacities but accounts for photospheric depletion , simulating the state of affairs when dust forms and then gravitationally settles below the photosphere .",
    "all 3 treatments treat line broadening in the same fashion .",
    "we find that the `` standard '' and `` dusty '' models do a poor job of reproducing the optical observations  the alkali lines in the first are too narrow and in the second they are too weak to fit most observations . the `` cleared - dust '' models , however , fit the data much better .",
    "until 1997 , the only l - type object known was gd165b ( @xcite ) , although it was not identified with that sobriquet .",
    "indeed , a good spectral analysis of it has only recently appeared ( @xcite ) . all the l dwarfs studied in this paper , therefore , are recent discoveries .",
    "they come primarily from the denis all - sky ir southern survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "some are from other sources .",
    "kelu-1 ( @xcite ) was announced as the first confirmed field brown dwarf ; it was found in a proper motion survey of faint red objects .",
    "lp 944 - 20 is a late m star from the luyten proper motion survey , which @xcite discovered contains lithium , making it a brown dwarf .",
    "g196 - 3b is a brown dwarf companion to a nearby young m star found by @xcite ; this is among the lowest mass brown dwarfs currently imaged .",
    "lhs 102b is an l dwarf companion to another nearby m star , found by a proper motion study of the eros project s images ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the 2mass project has greatly added to the inventory of l stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our sample is not selected in any particular way , but is a first look at objects out of the initial discovery list of cool vlm field objects .",
    "the list of objects observed is given in table 1 ( the spectral types listed in table 1 are from the literature ; see the end of  5.1 for a discussion ) .",
    "there are new objects being discovered monthly now by the denis , 2mass , and sloan surveys ; it will soon be possible to study samples chosen in a more statistically meaningful way .",
    "observations were made with the w. m. keck i 10-m telescope on mauna kea using the hires echelle spectrometer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observation dates are listed in table 1 .",
    "the instrument yielded 15 spectral orders from 640 nm to 860 nm ( with gaps between orders ) , detected with a tektronix @xmath3 ccd .",
    "the ccd pixels are 24@xmath4 in size and were binned 2",
    "@xmath5 2 ; the bins are hereafter referred to as individual `` pixels '' .",
    "each pixel covered 0.1a , and use of slit decker `` d1 '' gave a slit width of 1.15 arcsec projected on the sky , corresponding to 2 pixels on the ccd and a spectral resolution of r = 31000 .",
    "the slit length is 14 arcsec , allowing excellent sky subtraction .",
    "the ccd exhibited a dark count of @xmath62 e-/h and a readout noise of 5 e-/pixel .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard fashion for echelle spectra , using idl procedures .",
    "this includes flat - fielding with a quartz lamp , order definition and extraction and sky subtraction .",
    "the stellar slit function is found in the redmost order , and used to perform a weighted extraction in all orders .",
    "the wavelength scale is established using a thar spectrum taken without moving the grating ; the solution is a 2-d polynomial fit good to 0.3 pixels or better everywhere .",
    "cosmic - ray hits and other large noise - spikes were removed using an upward median correction routine , wherein points more than 7@xmath7 above the median ( calculated in 9-pixel bins ) were discarded .",
    "all points below the median were retained , to preserve the integrity of sharp absorption lines .    for the purpose of comparing data to models ,",
    "it is necessary to normalize both to the same continuum value .",
    "however , the continuum in the data and the models is characterized by a large number of overlapping molecular lines ; moreover , the data is not flux - calibrated , and has a superimposed echelle blaze function .",
    "thus , only a pseudo - continuum is derivable for the data and models .",
    "a straight - line fit to the pseudo - continuum was obtained for each observed spectrum , and divided out for normalization .",
    "the fit was made after manually discarding strong spectral lines ( selected by eye ) , including the alkali absorption lines .",
    "for , the overall fit was obtained in the range 8500 - 8540a ; for , in the range 7930 - 7960a .      barycentric and stellar radial velocity corrections were derived for each observed spectrum .",
    "we thank g. marcy for the idl routine which calculates the barycentric correction .",
    "the radial velocities were derived by measuring the peak position for cross - correlation functions between each star and a radial velocity standard .",
    "we chose gl 406 ( m6 ) as our standard for the m dwarfs , and lhs 29224 ( m9 ) and 2massw 1439 + 1929 ( l1 ) as our standards for the l - dwarfs .",
    "gl 406 was chosen as a standard since its velocity has been given by several authors to good accuracy .",
    "in particular , delfosse has found it to be + 19 as part of his precision radial velocity project .",
    "measurement of the line shift on an absolute wavelength scale for our december 1997 observation of gl 406 yielded a velocity of + 19 . a previous spectrum taken by basri in november 1993",
    "gives + 18 , and a new spectrum observed in june 1999 gives + 19 ( using the december 1997 spectrum as calibrator ) .",
    "however , measurement of the line shift on an absolute wavelength scale yields a velocity of + 43 for a spectrum observed on june 2 , 1997 ( with an accuracy of about 1 ) .",
    "cross - correlation of this spectrum with the december 1997 gl 406 observation also yields a velocity of + 43 .",
    "another spectrum of gl 406 taken the next night ( june 3 , 1997 ) , with a different grating setting , also yields a similar anomalous velocity ( + 40 ) upon cross - correlation with the december 1997 observation .",
    "we examined the discrepant velocity of june 1997 , comparing the thar spectra and night sky spectra with those of december 1997 to confirm that the grating had not moved from where we thought it was .",
    "there is a clear shift of the star compared with night sky lines on the same echelle frames for the two epochs .",
    "the stellar spectra themselves are otherwise almost identical .",
    "radial velocities of all objects earlier than l0 were obtained by independent cross - correlation with the december 1997 and june 1999 gl 406 spectra , in the spectral interval 8630 - 8753a   ( containing tio , vo , crh and feh lines ) .",
    "the results are mutually consistent .",
    "we also obtained radial velocities of the objects earlier than l0 through cross - correlation with the june 1997 gl406 spectra in the stated interval - the velocities obtained were consistent ( within @xmath05 ) with those obtained through cross - correlation with the december 1997 and june 1999 gl406 spectra .",
    "this implies that the anomalous gl406 radial velocity of june 1997 is real .",
    "delfosse , however , has not seen radial velocity variations in his precision observations of gl 406 , including one only a few months away from those reported here .",
    "either gl 406 is a radial velocity variable , or we happened to observe a near twin quite close by ( none is known ) .",
    "we have not discovered such variable behavior in any other of our sample objects .",
    "however , @xcite obtained an `` inexplicable '' discrepancy in velocity for gj 1111 compared to other published results .",
    "such behavior could result if these are highly eccentric single - lined spectroscopic binaries .",
    "clearly these systems bear closer monitoring .",
    "since the spectra of the objects l0 and later in our sample in the given interval are not very similar to that of gl 406 ( as tio and vo disappear and crh and feh appear with decreasing temperature ) , cross - correlation for these objects was carried out using lhs 2924 ( m9 ) and 2massw 1439 + 1929(l1 ) as independent standards .",
    "radial velocities were then calculated using the radial velocity of -37 and -29 obtained for lhs 2924 and 2massw 1439 + 1929 respectively by cross - correlation with the gl 406 spectra .",
    "the results were mutually consistent .",
    "however , the very coolest objects ( denis - p j0205 - 1159 , 2massw 1632 + 1904 and denis - p j0255 - 4700 ; @xmath6 l5-l6 ) , did not yield very good cross - correlation functions with either of the two calibrators .",
    "two factors probably contribute to this : the lower s / n of the spectra of these three objects , and the fact that , at their low , their spectral features begin to diverge from those of the two calibrators .",
    "the radial velocity results are given in table 1 .",
    "the stated errors in the gl 406 december 1997 and june 1999 radial velocities are from comparing our values to those of delfosse .",
    "all other stated errors are calculated from the differences in radial velocity yielded by using different calibrator spectra .",
    "as photospheric temperatures decrease , atoms combine to form molecules ; upon still further cooling , atoms and molecules may coagulate to form dust grains",
    ". dust formation can change the atmospheric spectral characteristics in various ways .",
    "for example , grains can warm the photosphere by backwarming , making the spectral distribution redder while weakening molecular lines ( e.g. , of h@xmath2o and tio ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "dust formation decreases the photospheric gas phase abundance of the atoms that form dust ( e.g. ti , ca , al , mg , si , fe ) . furthermore , with decreasing temperature , dust grains can become larger and gravitationally settle below the photosphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in any attempt to assign effective temperatures to cool photospheres , we must make use of models that take dust formation and behavior into account .",
    "three basic models are considered :    _ standard ( no - dust ) models _ : in these models , various molecules are formed with decreasing , but no dust is allowed to form .",
    "these are the nextgen series of models described by @xcite .",
    "this scenario is known to be problematic below a certain temperature ; @xcite have argued that this temperature might be as high as 2800k .",
    "a panel of spectra from these models in the region is shown in fig .",
    "[ stdmod ] , left panel .",
    "the opacity is dominated by tio over most of the spectrum shown .",
    "there is also a band due to vo at 8528a  ; this is treated with the jola ( just overlapping line approximation ) method , as no good line lists are available for this molecule .",
    "the apparent tio strengths remain high throughout the temperature range ( 2500 - 1600k ) shown , and the line at 8521a   grows moderately stronger",
    ". it does not achieve anything like the observed strengths of in l dwarfs .",
    "_ dusty models _ : here , various molecules are formed with decreasing , which then coalesce into dust grains that remain in the photosphere .",
    "a range of grain sizes is assumed , and the resulting dust opacity taken into account , as well as the photospheric depletion of dust - forming atoms and molecules .",
    "these models are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the same spectral region as above is shown for this model approximation in fig .",
    "[ stdmod ] , right panel .",
    "even at 2600k the spectrum looks rather different , as ti is already condensing out and becoming unavailable to the molecular bands .",
    "a very different set of molecular lines is apparent at 2200k , and the line has actually disappeared ! this is not due to depletion of atomic cesium , but the growth of stronger opacity sources . at cooler temperatures ,",
    "all the molecular lines are increasingly weakened by the growing dominance of the ( featureless ) dust opacity , leaving a rather smooth spectrum by 1600k .",
    "what is not apparent from these normalized plots is that the actual flux levels are quite different in the 2 panels . in the models without dust",
    "the tio lines strongly suppress the flux , while the dusty case is brighter not only because of lower opacity but because the atmosphere is heated by absorption of radiation by the dust .",
    "_ cleared - dust models _ : in this case as dust grains form they are assumed to gravitationally settle below the photosphere .",
    "these models are constructed using the full dust equation of state ( thus accounting for photospheric depletion of dust - forming materials ) but neglecting dust opacity .    in these",
    "spectra ( fig .",
    "[ dustmod ] , left panel ) the strengths of both molecular and atomic lines grow at cooler temperatures .",
    "although tio is gone , it is replaced by other molecular lines ( such as crh ) , but these are not nearly as strong in absolute opacity .",
    "the vo jola features at 8528   grows stronger with cooler temperatures ( not seen in the observations ) .",
    "the line becomes very strong at cooler temperatures in agreement with observations .",
    "the line wings are easily able to overcome the rather weak molecular opacities , and the line is not only deep but broad .",
    "these are collisional damping wings . in fig .",
    "[ dustmod ] ( right panel ) we show the analogous spectra for the region , with a vo jola feature at 7942  . similar behavior is apparent , except that the molecular opacities are even weaker , and the line comes to completely dominate the spectral region shown by 1600k",
    "this is partly due to the increased abundance of compared to ( the resonance lines , not shown , are vastly stronger than even , due to a much higher abundance ; these lines grow wings which cover more than 100 a ) .",
    "it is the lack of tio combined with the lack of dust opacities which allow the atomic lines to grow so strong in these models , and they resemble the observations most closely .",
    "naively , one might have expected the standard models to hold true in our hottest objects , the dusty models in the cooler objects , and the cleared - dust ones in the coolest objects .",
    "however , our observations indicate that the dusty models are never representative of the optical observations . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite find their best fit to the infrared photometry ( color _ and _ absolute flux ) of l and very late m dwarfs with these dusty models .",
    "one way of reconciling this disparity is to postulate that gravitational settling depletes dust in the upper photosphere ( where the visible spectrum forms ) , but not in the lower photosphere ( where the ir spectrum forms ) . in reality ,",
    "formation of dust clouds , dredging up of grains by convection , and various other meteorological phenomena must be modeled for an accurate portrayal of the situation . in our present early stages of modeling",
    ", we expect the three models outlined above to at least bracket the observed spectra .",
    "in this section , we present a discussion of determination of rotational broadening for each star (  4.1 ) , model parameters used for profile - fitting (  4.2 ) , and the adjustments made to the models for purposes of comparison to the data (  4.3 ) .",
    "though the known rotation velocities of very early m - dwarfs ( @xmath8m3 ) are usually @xmath9 5 , a significant fraction of the mid - m dwarfs ( m3.5 - m6 ) show faster rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a trend toward increasing rotation velocity has been observed as one moves to later m spectral classes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . since stellar rotation ( corrected for the inclination of the rotation axis )",
    "doppler broadens the line profile , and changes the way it merges into the surrounding pseudo - continuum , rotational effects must be considered during profile - fitting .",
    "we determine from molecular lines by the cross - correlation method described below .",
    "once the of the target objects are determined , the models are convolved with the corresponding rotation profiles .    for the spectral types earlier than l2 in our sample ,",
    "is determined by correlating their spectra in the interval @xmath68630 - 8753a   with that of gl 406 in the same interval .",
    "this spectral interval contains molecular lines caused by vo , tio , crh and feh .",
    "the for gl 406 has been determined by delfosse et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to be @xmath8 3 ; thus it can be considered at the level of accuracy desired here to be non - rotating ( since our instrumental broadening is of the same order ) .",
    "we first obtain the correlation function between our target spectrum and gl 406 in the specified spectral interval .",
    "we then artificially rotate our observed gl 406 spectrum to various velocities by a convolution algorithm , and obtain the correlation function between each of the rotated gl 406 spectra and the original unrotated gl 406 spectrum , in the same spectral interval .",
    "correlation functions are normalized to unity in the `` wings '' , and additively adjusted so the amplitude of the main peaks are matched .",
    "the correlation function thus obtained that best matches that between the target object and the unrotated gl 406 spectrum is selected , and the corresponding rotation velocity assigned to the target object .    for the cooler l dwarfs ( l2 and later ) in our sample , gl 406",
    "can no longer be used as a calibrator .",
    "their spectral features in the chosen interval ( or in any other interval available to us ) are not very similar to those in gl 406 .",
    "new molecular lines appear ( as expected ) with decreasing , and the correlation function of gl 406 with the l - dwarfs is no longer similar to those of gl 406 with rotated versions of itself .",
    "it is therefore preferable to find a cooler calibrator .",
    "an ideal calibrator should be a _",
    "non_-rotator , but we have not yet found any non - rotating l - dwarfs . both g196 - 3b and 2massw 1439 + 1929 , the slowest l - dwarf rotators in our sample , have a of 10 ( as determined through cross - correlation with gl 406 ) . we choose 2massw 1439 + 1929 as our calibrator , since it appears , from our model fits in cesium and rubidium , to be slightly cooler than g196 - 3b , and should thus be spectrally more similar to the later l - dwarfs , resulting in more robust correlation functions .    through empirical tests",
    ", we determined that a rotating calibrator can indeed be used , so long as the targets rotate sufficiently faster than the calibrator . more precisely , we find that the cooler l - dwarfs need to be rotating faster than 30 for their to be accurately determined ( with errors of @xmath105 ) , by cross - correlation with a 10 calibrator .",
    "if the cooler l - dwarfs have vsini between 15 and 30 , their rotational velocities can still be determined through cross - correlation with the 10 calibrator , by applying a small , systematic correction factor of @xmath9 5 .",
    "if the of the target is less than the of the calibrator , one can determine only that fact .",
    "the of all the objects in our sample of spectral type later than l1 have been determined by this method .",
    "the values of for all our targets are listed in table 2 .",
    "as noted previously in  2.3 , the coolest objects in our sample ( denis - p j0205 - 1159 , 2massw 1632 + 1904 and denis - p j0255 - 4700 ) do not yield very good correlation functions ; the errors in their determination are thus somewhat higher .      effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity and projected rotational velocity are all fundamental parameters which affect the observed spectra . in our case",
    "is kept a free parameter , while is determined as described above .",
    "surface gravity and metallicity also affect the observed line - broadening .",
    "higher surface gravity increases the pressure at every atmospheric layer , causing increased collisional ( van der waals ) line - broadening , and a larger concentration of molecules at every layer .",
    "the net effect is a broadening of the line with increasing gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity enters in two opposite ways .",
    "first , higher metallicity decreases the proportion of hydrogen particles ( which are the main source of collisional broadening ) .",
    "second , higher metallicity also implies a decrease in pressure at a given optical depth ( because of higher opacity ) , thereby reducing the line - broadening ( this second effect probably dominates the first one , unless one goes to extremes of metallicity ) . the net effect is a narrowing of the line with increasing metallicity ( @xcite ) .",
    "higher metallicity also implies a greater abundance of alkali nuclei , which increases the strength of the atomic alkali lines .",
    "this effect is diminished to the extent that the alkali metals end up in molecules .",
    "notice that increasing gravity and increasing metallicity affect line - broadening in opposite senses ; making the determination of gravity and metallicity a non - trivial task in cool dwarfs .",
    "metallicities for these relatively young objects may reasonably be supposed to be solar , but can vary somewhat about this value . in this paper",
    "we assume a solar metallicity and defer dealing with metallicity variations .",
    "stellar evolutionary models indicate that late - m and l dwarfs should have a surface gravity given approximately by log[@xmath11=4.5 - 5.5 ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". ideally one should keep @xmath12 a free parameter between these limits during profile - fitting . at the time of writing , however , ah cleared - dust models were not yet available for values of log[@xmath11 other than 5.0 .",
    "we therefore examined the no - dust ah models in the gravity range log[@xmath11=4.5 - 5.5 and temperature range = 2600 - 3200k ( no - dust ah models with varying gravity at lower temperatures were also unavailable ) .",
    "they show that the line in this range is saturated , while the line is not . however ,",
    "both the and lines in most of our data ( which is at much lower than 2600k ) are close to saturation .",
    "thus , we worked under the assumption that both and lines in our data ( and in the cleared - dust models ) behave similarly to the line in the no - dust ah models . with this assumption",
    ", we examined the behavior of the line in the no - dust ah models , at log[@xmath11=4.5,5.0 and 5.5 .",
    "we find that , at a given , the log[@xmath11=5.0 and log[@xmath11=5.5 lines are indistinguishable from each other , while the log[@xmath11=4.5 line is much narrower .",
    "moreover , at a given gravity , the line width is strongly dependent on , becoming narrower with increasing .",
    "what this means is that , with `` no - dust '' models , assuming log[@xmath11=5.0 when it is really 5.5 will not lead to any significant errors in determination . on the other hand ,",
    "if log[@xmath11 is really 4.5 , then using 5.0 models will lead us to infer a _ higher _ than is correct .",
    "for example , in the `` no - dust '' models , we find that the model line at = 2600k , log[@xmath11=4.5 is very similar to the model line at = 2900k , log[@xmath11=5.0 .",
    "thus , if 4.5 were the correct value for log[@xmath11 , using 5.0 would lead us to a 300k higher than the real value .",
    "therefore , if indeed the and lines in the `` cleared - dust '' models at lower temperatures mimic the line behavior in the higher temperature `` no - dust '' models , then our are too high by @xmath6300k for low - gravity objects ( see , for example , discussion of g196 - 3b in  5.9 ) . on the other hand , at very low temperatures , we predict that the very high saturation in the resonance lines will lead to decreasing sensitivity to gravity in these lines .",
    "thus , in general , it appears that gravity variations lead us to errors of @xmath9 + 300k in our sample .",
    "this issue must be revisited once cleared - dust ah models at different gravities become available .",
    "there is an interplay between and in cleared - dust ah models . decreasing increases both line width and line depth , while increasing also increases line width but _ decreases _ line depth .",
    "these effects are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ tvsini ] .",
    "we find that line width and line depth considered together provide constraints on the effective temperature and rotational velocity .",
    "we have used this fact to check the rotational velocities we derive through cross - correlation .",
    "the results from profile fitting are consistent with those from cross - correlation . however , since the cross - correlation method is more reliable and more precise , it is the method we use to determine .",
    "we note also that , at the lowest temparatures in our data ( @xmath6 1700k ) , rotational broadening effects are largely overwhelmed by collisional broadening ones in the resonance lines ( fig .",
    "[ tvsini ] ) .",
    "thus , the larger uncertainties in the of the coolest objects do not significantly affect their determination .",
    "we must also ask whether collisional broadening , due to surface gravity or metallicity variations , could affect our correlation method results by providing broadening we mistake as rotation",
    ". models with different metallicities have not yet been produced , but no - dust ah models with different gravities are available . by rotating models with different gravities ( log[@xmath11 = 3.5 , 4.5 , 5.5 ) to various velocities and cross - correlating between them , we find that the cross - correlation function is insensitive to gravity , even over the large range of gravities considered .",
    "thus , the we derive are likely valid even if our sample objects do not have our assumed value of log[g]=5.0 .",
    "insofar as metallicity effects are comparable to gravitational ones , the same should hold true for them .      as discussed , the models must first be corrected for rotational broadening effects ( see  4.2 ) through a convolution algorithm .",
    "this effect occurs at the star .",
    "there is also a finite instrumental resolution in the observations .",
    "thus , the rotationally broadened models were also broadened by gaussians in accordance with the hires resolution of 31000 ( this is an unimportant correction for most of the objects , given their high rotational velocities ) .    in the data ,",
    "the presence of overlapping molecular lines makes it necessary to renormalize each model with a derived pseudo - continuum ( after an initial normalization with the appropriate blackbody spectrum ) .",
    "derivation of pseudo - continua in the model spectra is complicated by sudden strong breaks which are not apparent in the observed spectra .",
    "these are produced by the just overlapping line approximation ( jola ) method used to treat vo , feh , cah , caoh and nh@xmath1 bands , for which insufficient parameters are currently available to allow a more accurate handling of the individual molecular lines . in the cleared - dust models",
    "the line occurs outside ( i.e. , blueward of ) the jola break region ( fig .",
    "[ dustmod ] , left panel ) , while the line occurs within a similar jola transition ( redward of the break , fig .",
    "[ dustmod ] , right panel ) .",
    "thus , the models compute the line with a background opacity higher than the real value , and we expect the model fits to the data to be less accurate than the fits . this effect becomes smaller as the line overwhelms the molecular opacities at the coolest temperatures .",
    "we have compensated for the jola breaks in the following fashion . for each resonance line",
    ", the model spectrum ( in the range 8500 - 8540a  for and 7930 - 7960a  for ) was divided into three sections - one blueward of the jola break region ( section 1 ) , one redward of it ( section 2 ) and a narrow section over which the break actually occurs ( section 3 ) .",
    "a polynomial fit is obtained for section 1 , after manually discarding strong spectral lines ( selected by eye ) , and section 1 is normalized by this fit . the flux in section 3",
    "is assigned a single value  the average , after normalization , of the 5 redmost points in section 1 .",
    "section 2 is then separately normalized with a polynomial fit ( again after discarding strong spectral features ) .",
    "the combined effect of these procedures is to artificially remove the jola feature and concurrently normalize the model by the pseudo - continuum .",
    "note that these changes do not affect the actual calculation of the spectrum ; they are applied post facto primarily for aesthetic reasons .",
    "they have the effect of making the entire model spectrum resemble the observations more closely .",
    "we emphasize that the profile - fitting we do is only in the line itself , while the normalization procedure detailed above affects primarily the spectrum outside the line .",
    "it should not affect our best fit parameters .",
    "our preliminary profile - fitting of both the and lines indicates that the cleared - dust models are the only ones that fit the entire line data set well .",
    "the dusty models do not agree with the data  dust opacity in the models makes the lines much weaker than observed .",
    "the no - dust models do not fit most of the data either , producing lines that are much narrower than those actually seen when the line depth is approximately correct , even after reasonable rotational broadening .",
    "this is because in the no - dust models , the opacity in the wings of the resonance line is dominated by molecular opacity rather than the line wing opacity itself ; hence only the narrow core of the resonance line is visible .    when no - dust models do fit the data , the inferred temperatures ( 2400 - 2700k ) agree with those from cleared - dust model fits .",
    "moreover , these inferred temperatures are high enough that we expect dust formation to be relatively unimportant ; the no - dust and cleared - dust models should resemble each other . in short",
    ", we found that cleared - dust models always produced fits at least as good as , and mostly much better than , either of the other two model types .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite , who finds that cleared - dust models provide the best overall spectral shape fits in the optical regime for their sample of denis objects . in what follows ,",
    "therefore , we only consider the results of profile fitting with cleared - dust models .",
    "we note again that in the infrared , dusty models do a better job of fitting seds ( eg .",
    "the left panels of the remaining figures show our best fits for and the right panels show the best fits for .",
    "when looking at the observed molecular regions , it may appear that the expected smoothing with increasing rotation is not present .",
    "this is because the spectra are somewhat noisy , and noise spikes have the same `` sharpness '' regardless of rotation .",
    "the eye is fooled by this , but a cross - correlation function is not .    before going on to examine the results of profile - fitting for each of the objects in detail , certain general comments can be made .",
    "first , the selection of best fits has been done by eye ; any quantitative fitting procedure would , in our opinion , require more accurate synthetic spectra ( especially for the molecular lines ) and less noisy observations than are currently available .",
    "second , the figures show both data and models after smoothing with a 5-pixel box ; this was done to allow the eye to follow the fit better by reducing noise fluctuations ; a 5-pixel box , applied to the models and our current data sample , does this well without affecting the integrity of the resonance line significantly .",
    "however , the actual model fits were derived by comparing unsmoothed data and models , to eliminate the possibility of overlooking real but sharp features during profile fitting .",
    "third , there exist certain obvious general discrepancies between the models and the observed spectra , which are better noted at the outset rather than repeatedly on an object - by - object basis .",
    "the first of these are poorly modeled or unmodeled molecular lines , that appear as additional broadenings in the observed and line wings , but not in the models ( see for example the and fits to kelu-1 ( fig .",
    "[ kelu1 ] ) ) . in general",
    ", they appear to increase in number and strength with decreasing .",
    "for instance , there is no hint of them in the wings of the gl 406 data ( @xmath62800k ) , while they appear strong and numerous in the observed wings of denis - p j0255 - 4700 ( @xmath61700k ) .",
    "this is expected , as the resonance line wings become broader with decreasing and include increasing numbers of the continuum molecular lines .",
    "hence , since the models do not exactly reproduce the observed continuum molecular lines , they also do not accurately reproduce the observed resonance lines at lower temperatures . on the other hand",
    ", the rotational velocity of the objects also increases with decreasing , which smooths out the molecular lines more than it does the stronger resonance lines . at a given , therefore , this allows better model fits to the data with increasing ( compare the 25 , 2200k fit to denis - p j0909 - 0658 ( fig .",
    "[ d0909 ] ) , to the 10 , 2200k fit to denis - p j2146 - 2153 ( fig .",
    "[ d2146 ] ) ) . of course",
    ", some of the features within the resonance lines may simply be noise spikes and not real molecular lines , as is probably the case in our low s / n observations ( e.g. , spectrum of denis - p j1228 - 1547 ( fig . [ den19 ] ) ) . however , this is not likely to be the case for those features that repeatedly appear in the spectra of a number of different objects .",
    "furthermore , for , there is a break in the observed spectra at @xmath6 7939a  that is not reproduced in the models ; the lack of agreement between models and data is most pronounced for this feature in the temperature range @xmath6 2300 - 2700k ( 2massw 1439 + 1929 to gl 406 ) .",
    "this feature , in fact , looks somewhat like the jola break that we labored to remove from the models .",
    "however , a comparison between the uncorrected models ( fig .",
    "[ dustmod ] , right panel ) and the data in the 7930 - 7960   range shows that the observed feature occurs blueward of the jola break in the models , and is stronger than the jola breaks at the same temperature .",
    "also , the observed opacity break is limited to only a small span of wavelengths ; this is not true for the modeled jola breaks , which persist over large wavelength spans . only in lp 944 - 20 ( fig .",
    "[ lp944 ] , right panel ) does the observed opacity break resemble the ( removed ) jola break .",
    "finally , the model jola break persists to much lower temperatures than the observed feature .",
    "thus , even if this is the feature that the jola formulation tries to simulate , the simulation is not a good one . except for this particular feature",
    ", there is reasonable agreement between the models and the data in the 7930 - 7960   range after the model jola break has been corrected for , so we appear vindicated in making this correction .",
    "the effect on the fine analysis of the background jola opacity in the model is complicated . on the one hand",
    ", the extra background opacity will tend to make the line look weaker ( similar to the effect of dust in the `` dusty '' models ) .",
    "this would require a cooler model to reproduce a given observed line strength , since the line grows with decreasing temperature .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of the jola break can be reduced by making the model hotter ( which lets the model line appear stronger ) .",
    "the question is whether this reduction goes faster than the reduction in line strength caused by the hotter temperature .",
    "our actual results suggest that it does , which leads us to derive generally hotter temperatures from the line than the line .",
    "this is why we base our final temperatures on .",
    "for , there is an absorption line , centered on @xmath68514a  , that appears in the models but is absent in the data . this feature becomes weaker with decreasing effective temperature .",
    "there is also a molecular feature at @xmath6 8505  , that becomes stronger with decreasing temperature in the models but follows the opposite trend in the data .",
    "this leads to poor agreement between models and data at this wavelength at effective temperatures below @xmath62000k .",
    "these features may both be due to water in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "there are other small anomalies in the region . in all but one of the observed objects with between 2150 and 2800k ( 2massw 1439 + 1929 to gl 406 , except denis - p j1208 + 0149 )",
    ", there appear to be molecular bands ( not strong in the models ) at 8506 and 8516a ; the latter impinges on the line .",
    "thus , when the normalized models and data are overlaid , the models appear brighter than the data over this wavelength range . to correct for this",
    ", the models ( for only the objects indicated above ) were also renormalized so as to fit the data between 8516 to 8524a .",
    "we show both normalizations in the figures for these objects , and tended to choose the temperature of the model renormalized to fit near the line .",
    "it is conceivable that this molecular band is the one that the model jola breaks try to simulate , but if so , the simulation is an inadequate one , for much the same reasons given above for the feature at 7939a .",
    "it is worth noting that both features occur over the same temperature range , and might thus be caused by the same molecule , vo or tio .",
    "finally , a note about which model fits are given , and why .",
    "for spectra for which only a single model is given , no other model was found to reasonably fit the data .",
    "where two model fits are given , one model is a better fit to the resonance line core , while the other is a better fit to the resonance line wings .    using information on the effective temperatures found below which best fit our profiles , @xcite have assigned subclasses to the l - type objects in our sample based on low dispersion spectral indices .",
    "they propose a subclass designation similar but not identical to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "while hotter objects have the same classification in both schemes , @xcite extend to l6 for the coolest objects , while @xcite extend to l8 for the same coolest objects .",
    "since @xcite assign these objects a temperature of @xmath61500k , while we find them to have of @xmath61700k , we prefer to follow @xcite .",
    "the designation `` bd '' in tables 1 and 2 indicates that lithium has been seen in the object , certifying it as substellar ( given the low temperatures ) .",
    "its absence does not mean the object is definitely stellar ; brown dwarfs above 60 will eventually deplete lithium .    in table 2 we provide a summary of our results .",
    "the spectral types listed are from @xcite for the objects common to both our samples . in most cases ,",
    "their spectral classification is consistent with our determinations ( using the relation between spectral subclass and temperature given by them ) . in the case of denis - p j1208 + 0149 , however , @xcite find m9 , while our belongs to a slightly later subclass ( m9.5 in their scheme ) .",
    "@xcite also assign l6 to denis - p j0255 - 4700 and 2massw 1632 + 1904 , while our determination suggests a slightly earlier type ( @xmath6l5 - 5.5 ) .",

    "denis - p j0021 - 4244 and denis - p j2146 - 2153 are not in the @xcite sample either , so we assign a spectral type to them based on our derived for the two objects and the spectral type given by @xcite for objects with similar .      @xcite find a of @xmath83 for gl 406 ; at our level of accuracy , this is indistinguishable from no rotation at all . with = 0 ,",

    "the rapid rotation may well be the explanation for the rather different equivalent widths reported by different authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation means that the pseudo - continuum will be set somewhat differently at low , medium , and high spectral resolutions .",
    "in fact , we now have high resolution spectra of kelu-1 from 4 separate nights spanning a year ( 2 pairs ) , and see no evidence of variability in the line profiles .",
    "we also note here that a parallax for kelu-1 has been found ( ruiz ; private communication ) ; this parallax indicates that kelu-1 appears somewhat brighter than would be expected from @xmath6 1900k ( as advocated by @xcite ) .",

    "the data is noisy , but the resonance line is reasonably fit by both 1900k after excluding the unmodeled molecular lines .    despite the fact that it does not show lithium ,",
    "it is very likely a brown dwarf based on its temperature ( with mass greater than 60 @xmath15 ) . @xcite",
    "worry about whether lithium may not show up due to formation of molecules such as licl , but this object is not too much cooler than denis - p j1228 - 1547 ( which shows lithium ) .",
    "even more reassuring is the detection of lithium in some objects this cool by @xcite , although they do see a possible beginning of the expected weakening of lithium at very cool temperatures .",
    "the results of @xcite are suspect , since they have not done a self - consistent treatment of the stellar model atmosphere .",
    "our models include lithium molecular formation but predict that strong lithium lines remain at these temperatures .",
    "in general we find that the cleared - dust model profiles fit the observed and resonance lines reasonably well ( with errors of @xmath0 50k in the fitting ) .",
    "we further find that , in a given object , the effective temperatures derived independently from and agree to within @xmath0 150k , with the fit consistently giving the higher temperature .",
    "we think this is due to the jola modeling of overlying molecular opacities , and the overlap of a jola band with the line .",
    "we find that the and analyses independently imply the same ordering of objects by effective temperature .",
    "the temperature scale derived from these lines may be a little hotter than that which seems to be coming out of consideration of low dispersion spectral energy distributions .",
    "this could be due to our approximate treatment of dust or variations in gravity and/or metallicity , or perhaps the infrared treatment needs adjustment .",
    "our final temperatures are based on the lines .    on the whole",
    ", we find good agreement between the models and the data with log[g]=5.0 and [ m / h]=0.0 . with these values , we estimate our errors in to be @xmath050k , since our model grid has a spacing of 100k .",
    "however , an analysis of `` no - dust '' ah models indicates that gravity variations in the log[@xmath11=4.5 - 5.5 regime may lead us to infer a greater by @xmath9 300k than the real value , for low - gravity objects .",
    "metallicity effects , which act in an opposite sense to gravity ones , may also affect our values .",
    "`` cleared - dust '' models with varying gravities and metallicites are needed to resolve this issue .    in the cases where the models do not reproduce the resonance lines very well",
    ", various effects may be responsible - collisional broadening effects due to metallicity and/or surface gravity variations , imperfectly modeled molecular opacity overlapping the line , or a low s / n ratio in the data .",
    "we find that the molecular lines are not modeled as well as the resonance lines are , and that the fit to the molecular lines generally worsens as one moves lower in effective temperature .",
    "both effects are expected , given the comparative paucity of well - determined parameters for many of the observed molecules .",
    "obviously it is desirable to improve our modeling of these lines .",
    "these affect the analysis of the objects at both high and low spectral dispersions ( and in both the optical and near - ir ) .",
    "the treatment of dust is still problematic . although it must be true that there is rather little dust opacity in the far red ( or we would not observe such strong atomic lines ) , it is not clear that our assumption of @xmath16 opacity is valid .",
    "we must also reconcile the results in the far red with those in the near infrared , which apparently require more dust opacity .",
    "we suggest that the dust has largely settled out of the portion of the atmosphere sampled by the alkali resonance lines , but is present in the lower photosphere where the near infrared is formed .",
    "@xcite have made a similar suggestion in the context of gl 229b .",
    "it will be important to study line profiles in the near infrared to help sort this out .",
    "the suggestion is that stratified dust models are worth pursuing . at the moment",
    ", the height or extent of such dust stratification can probably be better informed by observations than theory .",
    "this is the weak point in our analysis ; the addition of some dust opacity would tend to reduce the inferred temperatures .",
    "it is not clear whether the good fits to the line shapes can be preserved as dust opacity is added ( and a significant amount is needed to affect these very strong lines ) .",
    "the temperature scale found here led @xcite to propose a subclass designation scheme for the l spectral class in which l0 occurs at about 2200k , and each subclass is 100k cooler . for the coolest l dwarf in common with @xcite ( 2massw 1632 + 1904 ) , there is a disagreement in temperature .",
    "we predict that there is still a gap of a few hundred degrees between such objects and the t dwarfs , while @xcite believe the gap is quite small . on the other hand , variations in gravity and/or metallicity",
    "may be causing us to infer an artificially high for this object . depending on the resolution of this issue , either the @xcite or @xcite l star classification scheme",
    "should be modified in order that the l stars extend down to the appearance of methane in the k band .",
    "one clear and fairly model independent result from our analysis is that the average rotation velocity of very low mass stars gets higher and higher as one moves down through the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "it is clear that as hydrogen burning begins to turn off near the substellar boundary , the magnetic braking which affects all higher mass convective stars is also weakening .",
    "our sample is entirely from the field , and some objects are several hundred myr old ( although there is certainly an observational bias against finding very old objects , particularly if they are brown dwarfs ) .",
    "it appears that there is relatively little angular momentum evolution among these objects , and that they are typically born with relatively rapid rotation .",
    "their lack of magnetic activity is seen directly ( through a lack of emission ) , as well as indirectly in their rapid rotation .",
