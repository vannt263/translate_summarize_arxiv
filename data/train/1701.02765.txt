    "since the size of the snr g353.6@xmath00.7 is 30 arcmin , we do not have enough short spacings to completely measure the flux density of snr at the 610 and 1390 mhz frequencies .",
    "however , the effect of missing flux is small in the 325 mhz map .",
    "a simulation was done to quantify the flux density missing using aips task uvmod .",
    "this task allows to modify the @xmath17 data by adding a model .",
    "a sky model of a solid disc of 30 arcmin in diameter was simulated and then sampled to the gmrt @xmath17-coverage at the 325 mhz .",
    "the @xmath17-data was then imaged and more than 97 per cent of flux density was recovered .",
    "thus our gmrt 325 mhz map suffer from a maximum of 3 per cent missing flux while imaging a 30 arcmin structure .",
    "simulations for missing flux were done for individual filaments at 610 mhz which we describe in  4.3 .",
    "the snr was detected in the 325 and 610 mhz bands ( see fig . [ maps ] ) ; however , we do not detect it in the 1390 mhz band because of the missing flux due to lack of short spacings and the sensitivity limitation .",
    "the snr g353.6@xmath00.7 is close to the galactic plane , where the sky temperature ( @xmath26 ) is high due to the contribution of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "since observations were done with the alc on in its default mode and alc controls the antenna gains automatically , the antenna gains are reduced with respect to the calibrators and the flux density measurements will be less than their true value .",
    "as the antenna self - powers are proportional to the system temperatures ( @xmath15 ) , a correction can be found by measuring the ratio of antenna self - powers towards the target source and flux calibrator , under the assumption that the contribution of electronics towards the system temperature will not change significantly between the days of observations at the same frequency .",
    "the actual flux density of the target source can be recovered by applying this @xmath15 correction .",
    "test observations for the @xmath15 correction were taken in december 2015 , and the data was analysed using gmrt specific offline packages . after removing corrupted data ,",
    "the ratio of self - powers was found for each antenna .",

    "a detailed explanation of @xmath15 correction can be found in gmrt technical report by roy ( 2006 ) .",
    "another way of obtaining @xmath15 correction is to estimate @xmath26 at both target source and flux calibrator positions from the all - sky temperature map .",
    "haslam 408 mhz full sky temperature map by @xcite and 150 mhz temperature measurements by @xcite were used to obtain @xmath26 at both positions .",
    "the @xmath26 at 325 , 610 and 1390 mhz were calculated by assuming a spectral index of @xmath02.55 for galactic diffuse emission @xcite .",
    "system temperature has contributions from the sky , ground and receiver .",
    "the ground temperature ( @xmath27 ) and receiver temperature ( @xmath28 ) were taken from a gmrt technical reporthpage / users / doc / manual + /manual@xmath292013/manual@xmath2920sep2013.pdf ] .",
    "the @xmath15 correction obtained for each frequency from gmrt test observations , from the haslam map @xcite and from the 150 mhz map @xcite are given in table [ tsys ] .",
    "the @xmath15 correction from the haslam map is 54.6 per cent greater than that obtained from gmrt test observations at 325 mhz and 27.6 per cent greater at 610 mhz .",
    "the correction from the 150 mhz map is 39.7 per cent greater than that of the gmrt correction factor at 325 mhz and 17.0 per cent greater at 610 mhz . at 1390 mhz ,",
    "all three correction factors are similar . a similar trend in @xmath15 corrections with gmrt observations and the haslam map",
    "was also reported by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 measurements using gmrt at 240 mhz was determined by @xcite .",
    "they report differences in the @xmath26 measurements obtained from the haslam map and gmrt measurements , and the rms of percentage differences is 56 per cent",
    ". this discrepancy might be due to the assumption of a constant spectral index of @xmath02.55 across the whole sky , while determining @xmath26 using the haslam map .",
    "this assumption need not hold in all regions of the sky , especially towards the galactic centre where significant contribution from thermal emission is expected .",
    "moreover , variation in @xmath28 with elevation and ambient temperatures @xcite , will also affect the @xmath15 measurements .",
    "estimation from the haslam map does not account for these issues .",
    "hence @xmath15 correction from gmrt test observation seems to be more reliable than the one obtained from the haslam map . in this paper",
    ", we use the correction factor from gmrt observations to scale the observed flux density values .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]      since the structure of the snr is clearly detected in the 325 mhz radio map , the spatial correlation of the radio emission with that of the vhe emission can be compared .",
    "we compared the sites of synchrotron radio emission with the vhe emission measured with the h. e. s. s. @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "the spatial extent of the radio emission is similar to that of the vhe emission except for the region towards the west , where there is no radio emission though bright vhe emission is seen .",
    "it is likely that the radio emission in this region is sensitivity limited as this region has higher rms , due to contribution from contamination from nearby sources .",
    "the 3@xmath30 upper limit of flux density in this region at 325 mhz is 63 mjy which is comparable to the flux densities of filaments 3 and 4 ( see table [ filaments ] ) .",
    "the morphology of the snr is shell - like in both radio and vhe emission , but the finer structure do not seem to be correlated .",
    "the bright filaments in radio ( south - east filament and eastern filament , see fig .",
    "[ map2 ] ) is faint in vhe map .",
    "the peak in vhe emission is from the north - east region , where the radio emission is faint ( see fig .",
    "[ map2 ] ) .",
    "the azimuthal variation in radio brightness can be either due to the gradient of ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) density or due to the gradient of the magnetic field strength at the shock .",
    "an encounter of snr g353.6@xmath00.7 with a dense molecular cloud can create a density gradient in the ambient ism , though so far there is no evidence for such an interaction .",
    "the @xmath31co spectra from the vicinity of snr g353.6@xmath00.7 obtained by @xcite does not show any kinematic features that account for a possible interaction of the snr with a molecular cloud as reported in many interacting snrs .",
    "the @xmath2-ray azimuthal profile of snr g353.6@xmath00.7 is roughly flat @xcite except for the two @xmath2-ray peaks towards the north - east and west , which is suggestive of a fairly uniform ambient ism density @xcite .",
    "the shell structure of the snr recovered in the 325 mhz gmrt map is fairly symmetrical .",
    "these three arguments suggest non - interaction of snr g353.6@xmath00.7 with a molecular cloud .",
    "hence it is reasonable to assume that the medium surrounding the snr is of reasonably uniform density .",
    "in such a case , the variation in radio brightness can be most likely due to the variation of magnetic field if the injection is isotropic ( the efficiency of injection does not depend on the angle between shock normal and magnetic field ) .",
    "radio brightness increases in the region of high magnetic field since synchrotron emissivity is proportional to @xmath32 for a particle distribution @xmath33 scaling as @xmath34 .",
    "if the vhe emission is of leptonic origin , the electrons of energies @xmath35 emit vhe @xmath2-rays .",
    "these electrons experience ample radiative losses in this region and the energy loss rate is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "thus in the region of high magnetic field , the number of electrons emitting inverse compton ( ic ) @xmath2-rays deplete faster .",
    "this results in a low brightness of vhe emission where the radio brightness is still high @xcite , thus potentially explain the anti - correlation in the radio and @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "this explanation is valid only in the case of synchrotron - loss limited acceleration scenario where @xmath37 @xmath38 @xcite . in the case of age - limited accelaration scenario , @xmath39 @xmath40 @xcite and the anti - correlation",
    "can not be explained .",
    "however , the age of snr g353.6@xmath00.7 is not well known .",
    "the age estimates in the literature range from 2000 to 27000 years @xcite .    according to this model",
    ", we explain the anti - correlated emission of radio and vhe for snr g353.6 - 0.7 in a leptonic scenario as follows : evidence of variation of magnetic field for snr g353.6 - 0.7 comes from the analysis of spectral indices in  [ sec : spec ] . here",
    "we see roughly a 0.5 steepening of the spectral index of filament 2 compared to the typical snr spectral index of @xmath00.5 , consistent with synchrotron cooling , indicating higher magnetic field in this filament .",
    "thus the magnetic field strength is relatively high in the region of the south - east and eastern filaments , and hence it is bright in radio . due to",
    "high synchrotron cooling , there are fewer ic electrons , and hence the vhe emission is faint here .",
    "the magnetic field strength is low towards the northern region of the snr , and this results in less energy loss of electrons and bright ic emission . towards the west ,",
    "magnetic field strength is likely to be similar or less than that of the northern region , and the synchrotron emission is below the sensitivity limits where vhe emission is bright .",
    "one needs to measure local magnetic field using zeeman splitting of oh maser spots @xcite .",
    "magnetic field can also be estimated from the rim - width of thin x - ray filaments by high - resolution x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "the roughly a 0.5 steepening of the spectral index of filament 2 coincides with the region where the vhe emission is weakest , supporting the leptonic scenario in which the vhe production is suppressed due to synchrotron cooling in high magnetic field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this provides a strong indication of leptonic origin of tev @xmath2-rays in snr g353.6@xmath00.7 .",
    "the presence of non - thermal x - ray emission further supports the leptonic origin of vhe emission .",
    "non - thermal synchrotron x - ray emission implies the presence of tev electrons which can easily produce ic @xmath2 rays .",
    "the absence of any thermal x - ray emission further rules out hadronic origin of vhe emission as thermal x - ray emission is proportional to the square of the gas density , and hadronic processes are likely to dominate in high density regions @xcite . however , the hadronic scenario is still possible if the snr shock has not been able to heat the gas to high temperature if the gas is clumpy , then the dense clump can produce tev @xmath2-rays via hadronic process @xcite .",
    "this radio - vhe anti - correlation trend is not seen in any of the other four snrs in the vhe shell class .",
    "in fact , correlated emission of synchrotron radio and ic @xmath2-ray emission is seen in the bilateral snr 1006 @xcite .",
    "this correlated emission is explained by the variation of maximum energy of electrons over the snr to compensate for magnetic field variation @xcite .",
    "this can also happen if the dependence of injection and the electron maximum energy on the obliquity angle ( angle between magnetic field and the normal to the shock ) is strong enough to dominate the magnetic field variations @xcite .",

    "the diffuse radio emission towards the west overlaps the region of hess j1729@xmath0345 ( see fig .",
    "[ map2 ] ) .",
    "the morphology of the emission does not seem to be corresponding to hess j1729@xmath0345 , which is @xmath3 7 arcmin gaussian structure .",
    "however , a possible radio counterpart of hess j1729@xmath0345 is seen in the 843 mhz most ( see fig .",
    "[ byproduct ] ) and the 1.4 ghz sgps maps .",
    "the non - detection in the 1390 mhz gmrt map can be due to missing flux .",
    "our gmrt map at 1390 mhz is sensitive to angular scales up to 4 arcmin .",
    "thus significant flux will be missing while imaging a 7 arcmin structure .",
    "we obtain a spectral index of 3.0 @xmath14 0.2 , from the 843 mhz most map and the 1.4 ghz sgps map , which is consistent with thermal emission .",

    "we note that @xcite explained vhe emission from hess j1729@xmath0345 in a hadronic scenario .",

    "we carried out the gmrt observations of hess j1731@xmath0347 a.k.a .",
    "snr g353.6@xmath00.7 in the 325 , 610 and 1390 mhz band .",
    "we also observed a nearby source , hess j1729@xmath0345 with the gmrt in the 325 and 1390 mhz frequency bands to look for possible radio counterparts .",
    "our conclusions are :    1 .",
    "we detect the low - frequency radio morphology of snr g353.6@xmath00.7 with the gmrt at the 325 and 610 mhz frequencies .",
    "the shell structure of the snr with diffuse filaments is revealed in the 325 mhz map , and snr is partially seen in the 610 mhz map .",
    "the integrated flux density of the snr at the 325 mhz frequency is 1.84@xmath140.15 jy . assuming a typical spectral index of @xmath00.5 for snrs",
    ", we derive the integrated flux density at the 1.4 ghz as 0.88 jy .",
    "we note that this value is 1.5@xmath30 lower than the previously reported flux density 2.2@xmath140.9 jy at 1.4 ghz @xcite . the change in radio flux density changes the sed slightly .",
    "the spectral indices of the different filaments are estimated from the 325 and 610 mhz gmrt maps .",
    "the values of spectral indices vary from @xmath01.11 to @xmath00.15 and are consistent with the non - thermal radio emission .",
    "we compare the radio brightness profile with the vhe emission .",
    "it is particularly striking that the peak in @xmath2-ray emission comes from the filament which is faintest in the radio , and the brightest filaments in the radio correspond to faint emission in @xmath2-rays .",
    "the faintest filament in @xmath2-rays also shows a steep spectral index of @xmath01.11@xmath140.22",
    ". this may be due to the effect of non - uniform magnetic field strength , which is suggestive from the possible evidence of synchrotron cooling in that region of the snr . in this framework ,",
    "the anti - correlated emission can be explained if the vhe emission is of leptonic origin for an isotropic injection .",
    "this kind of an anti - correlated emission is reported for the first time in vhe shell snrs .",
    "the visual extent of the vhe emission appears to be slightly beyond the radio shell .",
    "however , our radio observations are most likely sensitivity limited .",
    "future radio observations with better sensitivity will probe the true extent of the snr and the upgraded gmrt observations with 2.5 times higher sensitivity and an order of magnitude larger bandwidth will prove to be useful for this .",
    "we also report a possible radio counterpart of hess j1729@xmath0345 from the 843 mhz most map and the 1.4 ghz sgps map .",
    "the radio emission is thermal and it supports the hadronic origin of @xmath2-rays from hess j1729@xmath0345 .",
