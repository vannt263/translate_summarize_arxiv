    "the wiener - hopf factorization method was initially used for solving certain integral equations @xcite .",
    "this method leads to wiener - hopf equations which can also be recast , by taking a fourier transform , in the form of a riemann - hilbert problem @xcite .",
    "although there is a well - known uniqueness theory based on the index for riemann - hilbert problems , the function class usually considered is hlder continuous functions going to one at infinity , and as will be seen , this is not always the right class for applications .",
    "we consider the problem of finding positive definite solutions to riemann - hilbert problems on the real line .",
    "this problem has a very natural connection with the theory of characteristic functions .",
    "this is because , by bochner s theorem , a positive definite function @xmath0 which is continuous at the origin and satisfies the equation @xmath1 , is the characteristic function of some random variable and vice versa .",
    "therefore , positive definite functions and characteristic functions are nearly synonymous .",
    "furthermore , characteristic functions and probability density functions are intimately connected in the sense that probability density functions are inverse fourier transforms of characteristic functions and characteristic functions are fourier transforms of probability density functions .",
    "applications of wiener - hopf factorization methods in finding the distribution of certain random variables in statistics dates back to baxter , donsker @xcite and pecherskii , rogozin @xcite .",
    "since characteristic functions are positive definite , we are interested in positive definite solutions of riemann - hilbert problems .",
    "this is particularly important when the solution can not be shown to be unique .    in the usual uniqueness theory for riemann - hilbert factorizations , the key condition that must be imposed on the function @xmath2 is that it must go to a nonzero constant at infinity : this condition is needed to insure that the so - called index of the function @xmath2 is well - defined and stable under small perturbations ( see definition [ def : index ] and the discussion there ) .",
    "as will be seen later , the theory of lvy processes gives natural examples of riemann - hilbert problems where we seek to factorize a characteristic function as the product of two characteristic functions , but the condition of going to a nonzero constant at infinity is too strong .",
    "thus the usual uniqueness theory for riemann - hilbert problems becomes problematic .",
    "however , what is really needed in this application is not so much the uniqueness theory as just the existence of a factorization where both factors are positive definite , as in the abovementioned result .",
    "the classical multiplicative homogeneous riemann - hilbert problem is to determine a sectionally analytic function @xmath3 with a jump discontinuity on an oriented contour @xmath4 consisting of a finite number of simple smooth closed or open curves , and with sections @xmath5 and @xmath6 constituting the boundary values on @xmath4 , which satisfies on @xmath4 the boundary condition @xmath7 where the function @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; satisfies the hlder condition everywhere except at a finite number of points where it may have discontinuities of the first kind . we restrict ourselves to the case where the contour is the real line , because the bochner theory of positive definite functions is only available for a very few contours , the cases of the real line and the unit circle are the only ones that appear to be tractable .    our main result ( corollary [ cor : factorization ] ) states that under certain conditions , a function @xmath2 on the real line can be factorized in the form @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive definite if and only if @xmath2 is positive definite .    a significant difficulty with the classical singular integral solutions to wiener - hopf equations in particular and riemann - hilbert problems in general , is that these solutions often involve integrals that are both analytically intractable and difficult to evaluate numerically ( c.f",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we develop a method which gives positive definite solutions to certain riemann - hilbert problems .",
    "furthermore , our method does nt suffer from the aforementioned difficulties and gives exact results that can be truncated with a known error term to provide accurate numerical approximations directly .",
    "we define positive definiteness for functions as follows :    a function on the real line is positive definite if and only if the fourier transform exists everywhere and takes values in the non - negative real numbers .",
    "we define positive semi - definiteness for matrices as follows :    a matrix is _ positive semi - definite _ if and only if it is hermitian and has non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "it was shown by bochner @xcite that the following theorem holds :    a function @xmath2 is positive definite if and only if the matrices of the form @xmath13 $ ] are positive semi - definite matrices , for all choices of finite subsets of points @xmath14 [ th : bochner ]    schur has obtained the following interesting property of positive semi - definite matrices @xcite :    [ schur ] the elementwise product @xmath15 $ ] of positive semi - definite matrices @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] is positive semi - definite.[th : schur ]    combining these two theorems , we prove the following :    if @xmath18 is positive definite then @xmath19 is positive definite ( for all scalars @xmath20 ) .",
    "if @xmath21 is positive definite for all @xmath22 and @xmath2 is bounded away from zero , then @xmath23 differs by a constant from a positive definite function .",
    "[ th : positivedef ]    first of all , we show that if @xmath2 is positive definite , then so is @xmath24 by theorem [ th : bochner ] , this is equivalent to showing that if matrices of the form @xmath13 $ ] are positive semi - definite , then so are the matrices @xmath25.$ ] but by theorem [ th : schur ] we have first of all that if @xmath13 $ ] is positive semi - definite then the same holds for @xmath26,$ ] where @xmath27 is a positive integer .",
    "the exponential function has an entire taylor series expansion @xmath28 where the coefficients are positive , so @xmath25 $ ] can be written as a convergent sum of positive semi - definite matrices , and is hence positive semi - definite .",
    "the second claim is proven in @xcite , see also @xcite .    finally , we recall the following :    [ shannon ] suppose that @xmath2 has a fourier transform that is zero outside the interval @xmath29.$ ] then , @xmath30 more generally , if @xmath2 is continuous , square - integrable , and is represented as the fourier transform of a function @xmath31 in @xmath32 then @xmath33 is bounded by @xmath34    the above theorem has a complicated and interesting history , which is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "there exist a multitude of early versions of the theorem , such as in @xcite , or the very early paper by de la valle poussin @xcite .",
    "the first part of the theorem as quoted above comes from @xcite , see also @xcite , and for the second part see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem b ) .",
    "the above theorem is often used to expand functions whose fourier transform decays at infinity , rather than actually being zero outside a bounded interval .",
    "thus , for example , rybicki @xcite shows by applying the above theorem that @xmath35 where @xmath36 happens to be the complex dawson s integral .",
    "we now give a corollary that generalizes rybicki s observation : +    suppose that @xmath37 is positive definite and continuous .",
    "then , @xmath2 is represented as the fourier transform of some function in @xmath38 and @xmath39 where the limit is with respect to the supremum norm.[cor : sh ]    if @xmath2 is positive definite , then by definition its fourier transform @xmath31 is real - valued and non - negative everywhere . by the fourier inversion formula , which holds everywhere since @xmath2 is continuous , we then have that @xmath40 since @xmath31 is non - negative , this integral equals the @xmath41-norm of @xmath42 and is finite because the continuity of @xmath2 insures that @xmath43 is finite .",
