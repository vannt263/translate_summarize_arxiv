    "polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation come in two flavors : gradient - like , @xmath1 , component , and curl - like , @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "ten years ago , the first detection of the @xmath1-mode anisotropies was announced by the dasi team @xcite . since then many subsequent experiments _",
    "e.g. _ wmap @xcite , quad @xcite , or bicep @xcite have detected the @xmath1-mode anisotropies with high significance deepening and confirming our understanding of the universe s evolution and structure formation .",
    "planck  @xcite is widely expected to provide shortly most comprehensive and precise constraints on the @xmath1-mode polarization properties in a range of angular scales extending from the largest down to few arc minutes .",
    "in contrast , no @xmath0-mode anisotropy has been detected yet only some upper limits are currently available , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "this is expected given minute amplitudes predicted for this signal .",
    "at the same time the scientific potential of the @xmath0-mode probe has been generally recognized as extremely promising .",
    "for instance , on the linear level the @xmath0-modes can be sourced by the primordial gravitational waves @xcite and not by the scalar fluctuations , thought to be largely responsible for the observed total intensity and @xmath1-mode anisotropies . consequently ,",
    "a detection of the @xmath0-mode anisotropy at large angular scales ( @xmath3 ) in excess of what is expected from the gravitational lensing signal , see below , could be seen as a direct validation of inflationary theories , as the latter are considered to be the most likely source of the gravity waves , and could allow for discrimination between different inflationary models .",
    "it could also set useful constraints on the reionization period @xcite . at smaller angular scales ,",
    "@xmath0-modes are expected to be mainly due to gravitational lensing of cmb photons which converts @xmath1-modes into @xmath0-modes @xcite and therefore their detection  a source of constraints on the matter perturbation evolution at redshift @xmath4 when light massive neutrinos and elusive dark energy both play potentially visible roles .    for these reasons ,",
    "many polarization experiments targeting @xmath0-modes have been built or proposed , including ground based observatories , those already operating _",
    "e.g. _ , polarbear @xcite or sptpol  @xcite or those , which are being developed , _",
    "e.g. _ , qubic @xcite , actpol @xcite , balloon borne experiments such as spider @xcite or ebex @xcite , which flew in winter 2012/13 , or to even a potential satellite mission litebird  @xcite , core@xcite , pixie  @xcite . with an exception of the qubic experiment , all these experiments scan the sky with one or more dishes and",
    "therefore most directly produce maps of the polarized stokes parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "calculation of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 signals from the @xmath5 and @xmath6 maps is a non - local  operation @xcite and can be done uniquely only if the full sky maps are available .",
    "however , this can be hardly the case even for the satellite missions due to the presence of heavy non - cosmological contamination due to the galactic emissions , which typically have to be masked out even after advanced and complex cleaning procedures have been applied . in the context of the pseudo - spectrum methods @xcite the incomplete sky coverage leads to the so called @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage , when the signal from @xmath1-modes is present in the reconstruction of @xmath0-modes power spectrum @xmath7 and more problematic , in the @xmath0-modes uncertainties . though no bias is directly introduced , the leakage is a problem due to the much higher amplitudes of the @xmath1-modes signal , which then inflates the overall uncertainty of the estimated @xmath0-modes signal potentially precluding its detection .",
    "several extensions of the standard pseudo - spectrum methods have been recently proposed designed to alleviate the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage problem . in this work",
    "we focus on the technique presented in refs . @xcite and working in the harmonic domain and referred to as the sz - method hereafter , and on two other techniques operating in the pixel domain presented in ref .",

    "@xcite , and referred to as the zb- and kn - techniques , respectively .",
    "all these methods consist in filtering @xmath1-modes leaking into @xmath0-modes for each specific realization of the polarized anisotropies and thus potentially resolve the excessive variance problem referred to earlier .    in this article , we first describe each of these methods within a common framework of so - called @xmath2-fields and then our implementations of them , emphasizing differences and similarities with those proposed in the original papers . throughout this work",
    "we compute spatial derivatives of the sky maps in the harmonic domain .",
    "this is in agreement with the original implementations of the considered techniques .",
    "we note however that an interesting , pixel - domain alternative has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and could be exploited in future work .",
    "for spectrum estimators we use consistently cross - spectra @xcite , rather than auto - spectra , avoiding therefore a need for estimating the instrumental noise spectrum .",
    "we use numerical experiments to test the efficiency of each of these methods in terms of quality of the @xmath7 reconstruction and above all of the resulting uncertainty .",
    "the numerical experiments involve two experimental set - ups : one mimicking a satellite mission ( loosely based on epic  @xcite ) , and , the other , a balloon - borne instrument ( inspired by ebex @xcite ) .",
    "we note that this kind of analyses of satellite - mission - like set - ups are largely absent in the literature , which predominantly has focused on small - sky cases only .",
    "though other techniques , e.g. , maximum - likelihood based power spectrum estimators , may address better some of the problems faced by nearly - full sky observations , performance of the pseudo - spectrum methods in this regime is clearly of practical importance .    the general pseudo - spectrum formalism , as well as its standard and extended renditions relevant for this work ,",
    "are introduced in section [ sect : polarization ] .",
    "an overview of the methods and their implementations can be found in section [ sect : formalism ] .",
    "the numerical results are given in section [ sect : results ] , which also presents the case for the sz - method as the one which gives the smallest variances while avoiding a bias .",

    "the degree to which the apodization fulfills the boundary conditions will be a principal factor determining the level of a suppression of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage . at the same any apodization",
    "applied to realistic , meaning noisy , data will have a direct impact on the resulting uncertainties of the spectrum estimate . in the context of the pure pseudo - spectrum method ,",
    "systematic approaches have been developed and studied in detail , which allow for a numerical optimisation of sky apodizations in order to ensure a nearly minimal value of the final spectrum uncertainty  @xcite . these are either based on mc simulations or semi - analytic techniques . in the former case ,",

    "we refer to these latter windows as _ variance - optimized apodization_. in both cases the optimization could , and should , be applied bin - by - bin to ensure the best results .",
    "as discussed at length in  @xcite both these approaches require some prior assumptions concerning , for instance , the angular power spectra of @xmath1- and @xmath0-modes , however , the results of the optimisation are found to be only mildly dependent on details of the assumed @xmath0-mode spectrum .",
    "it has been shown via numerical experiments @xcite that the variance - optimized apodizations lead systematically to the lowest error bars on the reconstructed @xmath83 s and therefore will be used them in this work .",
    "those variance - optimized apodizations can be computed in two ways , depending on the domain ( harmonic domain or pixel domain ) in which the linear system is solved . for the peculiar case of homogeneous noise , resolution",

    "does not strictly satisfy these conditions and the resulting pseudo - multipoles will not be strictly equal to the pure pseudo - multipoles .",

    "the @xmath88 fields are computed directly in the pixel domain and for the cut - sky .",

    "consequently , we could estimate the field , @xmath59 consistently on the cut - sky by first computing the rhs of eq .",

    "though straightforward a priori a care has to be exercised while doing so because of @xmath48 vanishing at the observed area edges .",
    "one option , adopted in @xcite , relies on simple trimming the troublesome , boundary layer , leaving only those pixels for which the division is numerically reliable .",
    "this leads to some loss of the information but solves simultaneously the divergence problem appearing on step 1 .",
    "the amount lost due to trimming will depend on the details of how the trimming is done , a practical complication , which needs to be addressed in this approach .",
    "an alternative way of resolving both these issues at the same time , which we propose here and which is free of such practical complications , is to define pseudo - multipoles using the field , @xmath97 , and then to correct for the presence of the apodization on the binned spectrum estimation step , eq .  .",
    "it is clear from eq .   that the estimation of the @xmath97 field does not suffer of any singularities at the edges .",
    "this method is the method of choice in this work .",
    "we note that this method is not lossless either , as the apodization it invokes will unavoidably compromise some information .",
    "nevertheless , the information loss in this case is expected to be smaller than in the former one .",
    "for instance , it is argued in sec .",
    "iv of @xcite that to analyze a map covering 3% of the sky ( a spherical cap with a radius of 20 degrees is assumed as the observed part of the sky ) , it is necessary to remove an external layer with a width of 2 degrees ; thus reducing the effective sky coverage from 3% to 2.4% ( assuming a binary mask to weight the resulting @xmath59 map ) .",
    "as shown hereafter , by focusing on @xmath97 , we are able to solve for the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage by using an apodization length of 1 degree . as a consequence , for a spherical cap with a radius of 20 degrees ,",
    "the effective sky coverage is reduced from 3% to 2.9% ( an explicit expression for the effective sky coverage assuming non - binary mask can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath71  _ step 3 _ :    kernel @xmath98 is computed taking advantage of the fact that the @xmath59 field is a scalar , like temperature , made of @xmath0-modes . the explicit expression of @xmath98 is given by eq . (",
    "39 ) of @xcite ( following what was derived for temperature @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath99 with @xmath100 the multipoles of the @xmath101 function are _ not _ equal to the square of the multipoles of @xmath48 . ] .",
    "@xmath71  _ step 4 _ :    the linear system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : binnedsystem ] ) is inverted neglecting the off - diagonal block , @xmath37 , and therefore also the residual @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage .      in this approach",
    "we could either use analytic windows or the variance - optimized windows obtained from the optimization procedure developed within the framework of the sz - method . in this former case",
    ", we will always use the @xmath82 family of windows from ref .",
    "@xcite and use mc simulations to determine their optimal apodization length .    in the case of the variance - optimized apodizations computed in the harmonic domain , it may appear that to ensure their optimality , we should use a window given by a square root of the actual optimized one , i.e. , @xmath102 , to compensate for the fact that it is a square of the window which is used as the apodization in our implementation of the zb - approach .",
    "whether such a window could be a viable option , will depend whether it does not cause any problems in the calculation of the rhs of eq .   at the patch edges .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this is always the case for windows , which are forced to obey the boundary conditions strictly .",
    "this is because such windows scale at the boundary as @xmath103 , with @xmath104 ,  @xcite therefore both quantities , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , ( where @xmath107 ) , needed to compute the rhs of eq .   are well - behaved for @xmath108 .",
    "however , the variance - optimized windows fulfil the boundary condition only approximately , what may lead to singularities of the derivatives of @xmath109 . to avoid that",
    ", we further multiply the variance - optimised windows by some analytic window , with a narrow apodizaton length .",
    "this is designed to affect as little as possible the properties of the initial window but enforce the boundary conditions strictly and therefore ensure proper behaviour of the resulting window at the boundary . in practice",
    ", we have found that using either the corrected @xmath109 window or directly @xmath110 leads to comparable results and numerical results presented hereafter are using the latter ones .",
    "it is important to notice that in such settings , the variance - optimized windows computed in the pixel domain can not be directly applied . indeed",
    ", such windows do not conform typically with the derivative relationship between the different windows , i.e. , @xmath111 or the boundary conditions , i.e. , @xmath112 .",
    "however , these conditions are essentially mandatory for the zb - method for two reasons .",
    "first , the method requires that @xmath113 is related to @xmath114 and @xmath115 , as e.g. , it is in eq .",
    ", that however without the assumptions about the windows properties is at least tedious .",
    "second , even if such an expression is found , this will lead to mixing kernels , which will not be numerically computable from the first principles , as in e.g. , eq .",
    ", as they will involve the product of three functions : @xmath116 multiplied by either @xmath117 or @xmath43 , and by @xmath118 , therefore leaving time consuming monte carlos as the only viable option for their estimation .        another way of estimating the @xmath59 field is by generalizing its definition to the cut - sky case",
    "this can be done straightforwardly by modifying eq .   as follows , @xmath119 , \\label{eq : chibdefcut}\\ ] ] where as usual @xmath43 stands for a binary mask and the tilde over the @xmath2 symbol is used to emphasize that at least in principle this is a different object than the true @xmath59 field defined on the cut sky , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath120 .",
    "we note however that as long as @xmath43 is constant ( and for simplicity assumed to be equal to @xmath46 ) , _ i.e. _ , in the interior of the observed patch , the two fields are indeed identical @xmath121 . in principle",
    "the only problem arises therefore at the patch edges . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite one could use this observation to reconstruct the true @xmath59 field everywhere with an exception of the boundary layer .",
    "the problem becomes then technical and boils down to a question how to calculate the derivatives required by such a procedure .",
    "@xcite propose to do it in the harmonic domain and use semi - analytic formulae of @xcite to represent the derivatives via convolutions of some geometrical kernels .",
    "given that the mask is abruptly falling from @xmath46 to @xmath122 at the edges , it is not surprising , that such a procedure leads to significant oscillatory behavior at the edges , which extends well within the center part of the observed patch .",
    "this is a result of the necessity of imposing a finite band - limit on all harmonic decompositions performed as part of this procedure , even if the considered functions , with an abrupt jump does not have such a limit .",
    "such a band - limit is directly related to the pixelization used to represent the polarization fields .",
    "this has two practical consequences .",
    "first , a robust criterion has to be found deciding which pixels are to be retained , i.e , which are sufficiently clean of any @xmath1-mode contamination , second , the loss of area is expected to be rather significant .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details of this specific implementation .",
    "a more robust approach would either invoke different ways of calculating the derivatives , _",
    "e.g. _ , as proposed by @xcite , or introducing in eq .   a smooth apodization , @xmath48 , in place of the binary mask , @xmath43 .",
    "this second option was proposed by @xcite and this is the one we implement in this work .",
    "the apodization could alleviate the pixelization effects described earlier by truncating the band limit of the apodized polarization field , so the harmonic domain derivatives perform better .",
    "such a window would need to have a central region , where @xmath48 is constant ( and equal to @xmath46 ) before smoothly rolling off at the edges .",
    "as in the case of the binary mask only in this central region the reconstructed @xmath123 field would coincide with the true one and would be used for the power spectrum estimation .",
    "the main advantage of such a technique is that it provides a clear criterion which pixels to retain or to reject .",
    "nevertheless , it does not solve completely the pixelization effects as pixels inside the central area can be affected by the pixel - induced leakage but this time originating from the contour around this central area .",
    "however , and as numerical results shown in @xcite suggest , the pixelization effects at the inner contour are mitigated by the fact that @xmath48 is continuous as compared to the pixelization effects induced by considering the non - continuous binary mask .",
    "hereafter , we will use this second approach and apply a sky apodization to the polarization field .",
    "we will then use eq .",
    "but with a mask , @xmath43 , replaced by a window , @xmath48 , to calculate @xmath123 and later , the true @xmath124 where , @xmath125 is the binary mask built from the kept - in - the - analysis pixels , _",
    "i.e. _ , pixels for which @xmath48 is essentially constant .",
    "the numerical implementation of this approach consists then in two main steps , which need to be first applied to simulated and later actual data .",
    "the monte carlo simulations are employed to select optimal windows for a given problem .",
    "@xmath71  _ step 1 _ :    we calculate the apodized @xmath123 field for a selected window , @xmath48 .",
    "this involves performing numerical derivatives of the available polarization fields , @xmath53 and those are performed in the harmonic domain . in this work",
    "we use a family of arch - sine windows as defined in  @xcite with an apodization length which is to be tuned via monte carlo simulations .",
    "the criteria we use in the apodization length optimization process are the level of the @xmath0-spectrum bias and variance .",
    "@xmath71  _ step 2 _ :    we compute the @xmath0-mode power spectrum from the precomputed @xmath123 field .",
    "the spectrum is computed using only the trimmed , central part of the available patch , @xmath126 , which can be further apodized , if needed , and follows the general pseudo - spectrum method framework .",
    "hereafter , following  @xcite we will neglect possible leakages from the @xmath1-spectrum and use the scalar kernel as also used in the zb - approach , eq .  .",
    "we note however that unlike in the zb - method the leakage in this approach can be more pervasive affecting even the most central areas of the patch and therefore never fully removed via simple area trimming . for this reason one may ponder whether a more appropriate kernels can not be derived , which could account for these effects .",
    "the answer , which we discuss in more detail in appendix  [ app : knkernel ] , is that such kernels would need to be evaluated numerically and be necessarily very costly .",
    "we will therefore only consider the simplified case in this work .",
    "the sky apodization and masking needs to be performed on three different stages in this approach .",
    "first , we need to apodize the maps before computing the @xmath123 field .",
    "then we need to mask pixels , which are expected to be contaminated by the residual @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage .",
    "finally , we may want to apodize the reduced @xmath123 maps to localize better bin - to - bin correlations of the recovered @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "unlike in the case of the sz- and zb - techniques , one can not derive here some optimal windows from first principles. instead for the sky apodization required for the computation of @xmath123 we use a family of the arch - sine analytic windows , proposed in  @xcite , and resort to monte carlo simulations to optimize their apodization length . in this optimization procedure",
    "we always trim all the pixels within the boundary layer of @xmath48 , i.e. , where it is not constant , as these are the pixels , which are unavoidably affected by the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage , and we use only the remaining ones for the spectrum estimation .",
    "clearly , there will be still some level of the @xmath1-mode power in the map left over after such a trimming procedure , mostly due to pixel induced @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage .",
    "the level of this leakage depends on the assumed apodization length , becoming slower for its larger values , and the mc simulations are then used to find the smallest value of the latter ensuring a sufficiently low level of the leakage .",
    "this will at the same time maximize the sky area , given the acceptable leakage requirement , left for the final spectrum determination and therefore ensure that the spectrum variance is the smallest .",
    "the three methods considered in this work can be introduced within a common framework based on the @xmath59 field concept as has been done in this section and demonstrated to be all rather closely related .",
    "the fact , which may be potentially somewhat surprising given their original derivations .",
    "the two first methods , sz  and zb , in the renditions as considered in this paper are clearly equivalent on the analytical level , if the apodizations employed in both these cases are related to each other as , @xmath107 , and @xmath110 fulfills strictly the boundary conditions .",
    "the differences between these two approaches are therefore only in their numerical implementations and approximations which they imply .",
    "both these methods suffer due to pixelization issues , in particular arising due to a need to compute numerical derivatives , and which give rise to a residual contamination of the @xmath0-spectrum with the @xmath1-mode power .",
    "the sz - method requires only derivatives of the window functions , therefore , at least in the cases when these are given analytically , it is possible to estimate the non - diagonal coupling kernel , @xmath36 , and correct for some of those effects .",
    "such corrections are more difficult in the case of the zb - approach , where the non - diagonal kernel would have to be estimated completely numerically",
    ". the sz - method can potentially offer more freedom for an optimization of the @xmath0-spectrum variance as estimated for realistic noisy maps as the boundary conditions on the applied apodizations can be relaxed leading to an increase of the signal variance related to allowing for some @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage but a decrease of the total , signal+noise , one . at the same the off - diagonal ,",
    "polarization mode coupling kernels can be readily calculated and the estimated @xmath0-spectrum unbiased .",
    "the kn - approach can be looked at as an approximation of the zb - method .",
    "indeed the first term on the rhs of eq .   used by the zb - method coincides with the rhs of eq .",
    "( replacing @xmath43 by a sky apodization @xmath48 ) , which defines the first step of the kn - approach .",
    "we refer to app .",
    "[ app : knzb ] for a detailed discussion .",
    "the contributions of the extra three terms in eq .",
    "are localised around the patch boundary and removed in the kn - method by trimming the boundary layer , which is retained and used for the power spectrum estimation in the case of the former method .",
    "for this reason we may expect that the performance of the kn - method should be inferior to both the zb- and sz - approaches , which in turn we could expect to be nearly equivalent . in turn",

    "such a choice , in terms of the fisher errors leads to the lowest variances .",
    "the major advantage of the satellite experiments is their ability to measure the sky signals on the largest angular scales , and therefore having potential to constrain their power spectra all the way to the lowest multipoles .",
    "indeed , the simple fisher variance formula introduced earlier seems to suggest that this should be possible if only the sky coverage is sufficiently large . though this formula neglects the leakage it seems only natural to expect that it should be small for nearly full sky maps , and therefore should lead to subdominant effects as compared to other uncertainties , e.g. , cosmic variance .    in this section",
    "we confront these expectations against realistic simulations within the paradigm of pseudo - spectrum methods . in this context , if the leakage is indeed small , we may expect that even the standard pseudo - spectrum technique could perform sufficiently well assuring precision comparable to that of the other methods , which explicitly invoke some leakage correction , and not that far off the fisher predictions .",
    "below we therefore start from a discussion of the standard pseudo - spectrum technique .",

    "[ fig : pseudostd ] , which displays @xmath149 , upper curve , and @xmath150 , lower curves , computed for three different values of @xmath151 .",
    "clearly , the leaked power , @xmath149 , dominates over the true @xmath0-modes at least up to @xmath152 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the leakage is by far not insignificant even in the satellite case .",
    "furthermore , if we take a ratio of @xmath149 and @xmath150 as a measure of the magnitude of the leakage we find that its values are within a factor of @xmath153 from those obtained for the small - scale experiment considered later on , indicating that the leakage amount in both cases is in fact comparable , even if the latter experiment covers roughly @xmath154 smaller sky area than the former .",
    "this demonstrates that it is not merely sky area which matters as far as the leakage is concerned .",
    "in fact , the gain in the sky area in the case of the satellite experiment considered here comes at the price of a significantly more complex and longer perimeter , effects of which , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) offset the sky area advantage .",
    "we note that though we may attempt to simplify the boundary of the galactic mask to suppress the leakage , this is more difficult to be done with the point sources , which indeed seem to provide the major contribution to the observed level of the leakage .",
    "the large leakage found present on the pseudo - spectrum level will inevitably lead to excess variance of the @xmath0-mode spectrum estimate .",
