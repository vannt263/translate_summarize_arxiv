    "can be used to describe the discrete time dynamics of a quantity which changes in each period by an amount which is proportional to its value at the beginning of the period .",
    "the random multiplier is positive and follows a geometric brownian motion in discrete time .",
    "the simplest such variable is a bank account which accrues interest by simple compounding over each period @xmath21 , assuming that the interest rate @xmath22 follows a geometric brownian motion in discrete time .",
    "this corresponds to the black , derman , toy model of stochastic interest rates in mathematical finance @xcite .",
    "more generally , the model ( [ rmp ] ) could be used to describe multiplicative processes with markovian dependence , such as for example of the type considered in @xcite in the context of population dynamics .",

    "( [ rmp ] ) have the same average value @xmath23 . if the multipliers @xmath19 were independent random variables , one would expect the average of the process ( [ rmp ] ) to have a simple geometric growth as @xmath24 .",

    "their covariance is @xmath25 the average value @xmath3 of the process ( [ rmp ] ) can be computed exactly , and displays a surprising explosive behavior for sufficiently large volatility @xmath26 or sufficiently large time step @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the naive expectation of a geometric growth obtained by assuming statistically independent multipliers , and is an effect due to the correlation between successive multipliers @xmath19 . the same explosive behavior is noted also for the higher positive integer moments @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the probability distribution of the variable @xmath12 develops heavy tails under certain conditions .",

    "the precise relation of the random multiplicative process ( [ rmp ] ) to the one dimensional lattice gas with interaction ( [ ham ] ) is given by the equality @xmath42 between the average @xmath3 and the grand partition function @xmath43 of the lattice gas with fugacity @xmath17 and temperature @xmath44 with @xmath45 the grand partition function of the lattice gas is @xmath46 with @xmath47 the canonical partition function , given by a sum over all configurations with @xmath48 occupied sites @xmath49    the relation ( [ equiv ] ) can be used to prove the following result : the lyapunov exponent , defined as the limit @xmath50 exists and depends only on @xmath17 and @xmath44 with @xmath51 given by ( [ betadef ] ) .",

    "it also implies that the lyapunov exponent @xmath30 has a scaling property in the large @xmath27 limit , as it depends on @xmath61 only through the combination @xmath62 defined in ( [ betadef ] ) .",
