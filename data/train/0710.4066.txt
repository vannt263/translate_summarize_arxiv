    "most patterns observed in nature are created by instabilities that occur in an uncontrolled noisy environment  : convection in the atmospheric layers and in the mantle are subject to inhomogeneous and fluctuating heat flux ; sand dunes are formed under winds with fluctuating directions and strengths .",
    "these fluctuations usually affect the control parameters driving the instabilities , such as the rayleigh number which is proportional to the imposed temperature gradient in natural convection .",
    "these fluctuations act multiplicatively on the unstable modes . in the same spirit , the evolution of global quantities , averaged under small turbulent scales ,",
    "can be represented by a nonlinear equation with fluctuating global transport coefficients that reflect the complexity at small scales .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that the temporal evolution of the total heat flux in rotating convection can be described by a non  linear equation with a multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "the dynamo instability that describes the growth of the magnetic field of the earth and the stars because of the motion of conducting fluids in their cores , is usually analyzed in similar terms  :  the magnetic field is expected to grow at large scale , forced by a turbulent flow . here again , the parameters controlling the growth rate of the field are fluctuating @xcite .    since the theoretical predictions of stratonovich @xcite , and the experimental works of kawaboto , kabashima and tsuchiya @xcite , it is well known that the phase diagram of a system can be drastically modified by the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "because of stochastic fluctuations of the control parameter , the critical value of the threshold may change and noise can delay or favor a phase transition @xcite . when a physical system subject to noise undergoes bifurcations into states that have no deterministic counterparts , the stochastic phases generated by randomness have specific characteristics ( such as their scaling behavior and the associated critical exponents ) allowing to define new universality classes @xcite .    a straightforward approach to study the effect of noise on",
    "a bifurcation diagram would consist in analyzing the nonlinear langevin equation that governs the system .",
    "however , the interplay between noise and nonlinearity results in subtle effects that make nonlinear stochastic differential equations hard to handle @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest systems that can be used as a paradigm for the study of noise - induced phase transitions is the random frequency oscillator ( for a recent and detailed monograph devoted to this subject see @xcite ) . a deterministic oscillator with damping evolves towards the equilibrium state of minimal energy that represents the unique asymptotic state of the system .",
    "however , if the frequency of the oscillator is a time - dependent variable , the behavior may change  : due to continuous energy injection into the system through the frequency variations , the system may sustain non - zero oscillations even in the long time limit if the amplitude of the noise is large enough .    in this work , we present recent results on noise - induced transitions in a nonlinear oscillator with randomly modulated frequency .",
    "the ouline of this article is as follows .    in section  [ sec : lyapbif ] , we show that an explicit calculation of the lyapunov exponent allows to determine exactly the phase diagram of the noisy duffing oscillator @xcite . in the case of a single - well oscillator , a large enough noise destabilizes the origin ( which is a fixed point for the deterministic dynamics ) .",
    "the double - well oscillator presents a richer structure  : the unstable fixed point becomes a global attractor of the stochastic dynamics when the amplitude of the noise lies in a well - defined interval  : this is a typical example of a reentrant transition ( which was observed earlier in the more elaborate setting of spatially extended systems @xcite ) .",
    "these properties are only qualitatively modified when the noise has temporal correlations .    in section  [ sec : scaling ] , we discuss the scaling exponents associated with the order parameter in the vicinity of the transition . for a deterministic transition ,",
    "it is well - known that the different types of bifurcations can be classified by some characteristic exponents .",
    "we show , in the stochastic case , that these exponents can be modified by the noise  : the dynamical variable has a non - trivial scaling behaviour and its time series exhibits on - off intermittency .",
    "following @xcite , we explain that multiscaling and intermittency are intimately linked with each other and that their existence is due to the presence of low frequency components in the noise spectrum . by using a random process with a spectral structure richer than that of white or ornstein - uhlenbeck noise",
    ", we show that the deterministic exponents can be recovered by a suitable low - band flitering of the noise .",
    "this fact implies that the concept of critical exponents can be ambiguous for noise - induced bifurcations and is certainly not as useful as it is for deterministic phase transitions .",
    "section  [ sec : poincare ] presents a discussion on perturbative perturbative expansion of the nonlinear langevin equation . whereas most studies rely on fokker - planck type evolution equations for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) in which the noise is integrated out by mapping a stochastic ordinary differential equation into a deterministic partial differential equation in the phase space of the system , it is also possible to perform a direct perturbative expansion of the nonlinear langevin equation by using the classical poincar - lindstedt method @xcite .",
    "this technique has the advantage as compared to the more traditional approaches of being applicable to a noise with an arbitrary spectrum ( whereas fokker - planck equations are only valid for white - noise ) .",
    "however , due to the presence of low - frequencies in the noise spectrum , the perturbative expansion breaks down and diverges .",
    "this divergence is at the origin of the multiscaling behaviour and of the anomalous scaling exponents .",
    "the last section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we present the phase diagram of a nonlinear oscillator with a randomly modulated frequency . the case when the frequency is a periodic function of time",
    "is a classical problem known as the mathieu oscillator @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the ( damped ) mathieu oscillator is obtained by calculating the floquet exponents ( defined as the characteristic growth rates of the amplitude of the system ) .",
    "this phase diagram presents an alternance of stable regions in which the system evolves towards its equilibrium state and of unstable regions in which , because of parametric resonance , the amplitude of the oscillations grows without bound .",
    "a nonlinear term is needed to saturate these oscillations .",
    "when the frequency of the pendulum is a random process , the role of the floquet exponents is taken over by the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the system undergoes a bifurcation when the largest lyapunov exponent , defined as the growth rate of the logarithm of the energy , changes its sign .",
    "thus , the lyapunov exponent vanishes on the critical surface that separates the phases in the parameter space .",

    "the mathematical explanation for this behaviour is also elementary @xcite  : near the bifurcation threshold , when the lyapunov exponent @xmath91 , the stationary probability distribution function @xmath92 exhibits a power law divergence at the origin @xmath93 , and the region near the origin dominates the statistics  : it can be shown that near @xmath94 , the stationary energy distribution scales as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a positive constant . from this formula ,",

    "these works predict that the variable @xmath0 is intermittent and that the moments of @xmath0 exhibit _ anomalous scaling _ , @xmath122 _",
    "i.e. _ , all the moments grow linearly with the distance from threshold .",
    "this multiscaling behaviour , confirmed by numerical simulations for a gaussian white noise , was derived using effective fokker - planck equations .",
    "the origin of the contradiction between equations  ( [ eq : luckemoment ] ) and ( [ eq : anomalous ] ) lies in the divergences that appear in the poincar - linsdtedt expansion .",
    "this fact , identified in @xcite , implies that the results of @xcite are valid only for noises that do not have low frequencies .",
    "the importance of low frequencies in the noise spectrum can be seen analytically in a a model technically simpler than equation  ( [ eq : lucke1 ] ) . to simplify our discussion we work on the first order stochastic equation  : @xmath123 that we already encountered in the previous section . here",

    "we first remark that the presence of noise does not modify the bifurcation threshold ; indeed the lyapunov exponent of the system is given by @xmath129 and therefore the bifurcation always occurs at @xmath130 .",
    "when @xmath5 is a gaussian white noise , the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation corresponding to equation  ( [ eq : hopf ] ) is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 represents the euler gamma - function .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath139      for an arbitrary noise @xmath5 , it is still possible to obtain an exact solution of equation  ( [ eq : hopf ] ) for all times .",

    "we define the differential operator @xmath140 as follows , @xmath141 let us call @xmath142 the solution of the adjoint equation @xmath143 , which is given by @xmath144 multiplying equation  ( [ eq : hopf ] ) by the function @xmath145 and taking average values , we obtain @xmath146 integrating the left hand side of this equation by parts and taking into account the fact that @xmath145 is in the kernel of the adjoint operator @xmath147 , we derive the following relation @xmath148 similarly , we have @xmath149    dividing both sides of equation  ( [ eq : hopf ] ) by @xmath150 and using the auxiliary variable @xmath151 , we observe that equation  ( [ eq : hopf ] ) becomes a _ linear _ first order stochastic in @xmath152  : @xmath153 this equation can be solved exactly for all time by using the method of variation of constants . introducing the initial value @xmath154 that has the dimensions @xmath155 we obtain the following explicit formula for @xmath0  : @xmath156 we have defined here the auxiliary random variable @xmath157  : @xmath158 because @xmath127 is taken to be a gaussian random process",
    ", @xmath157 is also gaussian .      in order to determine the scaling on the moments of @xmath0",
    ", we must evaluate expressions of the type @xmath159 . because @xmath157 is a gaussian random variable ,",
    "this quantity is given in terms of the variance of @xmath157  : @xmath160 the last integral is well defined at @xmath161 ( the time @xmath162 introduces an effective low frequency cut - off for @xmath163 ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath164 for @xmath19 depends on the behaviour of @xmath128 at @xmath165 .",
    "the following two cases must be distinguished  :    \\(i ) the spectrum of the noise vanishes at low frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath166 . because @xmath128 is an even function of @xmath3",
    ", we suppose that @xmath167 for @xmath168 ( we disgard non - analytic behaviour of the power spectrum at the origin",
    ". such non - analyticity would correspond to long tails in the correlation function of the noise ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the power spectrum of the noise is finite at @xmath169 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath170 .    in case ( i ) , the long time limit of equation  ( [ eq : varb ] ) is readily derived and we obtain ( by using the riemann - lebesgue lemma ) @xmath171 the variance of @xmath157 has a _",
    "finite _ limit at large times .    in case ( ii )",
    ", the integral on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : varb ] ) diverges when @xmath172 and its leading behaviour is @xmath173 the variance of @xmath157 grows linearly with time in the long time limit .",
    "we have seen that the behaviour of the variance of @xmath157 in the long time limit crucially depends on the on the behaviour of the noise spectrum at low frequencies . when @xmath170 the noise @xmath5 acts dominantly as a white noise and the multiscaling behaviour  ( [ eq : scalmomentblanc ] ) is recovered when @xmath19 .    when @xmath166 , the random variable @xmath157 has a finite variance even when @xmath19 . using equation  ( [ eq : formulex(t ) ] ) and keeping only the dominant terms in the long time limit ,",
    "we obtain @xmath174 therefore , we have @xmath175 the fluctuations of the random variable being of order one , the integral on the r.h.s . of this equation",
    "is dominated by the contribution of the linear term @xmath176 .",
    "the contribution is maximal in the region @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath178 where the constant @xmath179 depends a priori on the statistical properties of the noise .",
    "this equation predicts that subject to a noise without low frequencies , the amplitude @xmath47 exhibits a normal scaling behaviour identical to that of the deterministic case .",
    "the stochastic oscillator is an ideal model to study the effect of random perturbations on a nonlinear dynamical system .",
    "various effects of noise can be demonstrated on this simple model  : noise can shift bifurcation thresholds , can create new phases by destabilizing ( resp . stabilizing )",
    "stable ( resp .",
    "unstable ) fixed points , can induce reentrant behaviour .",
    "the relevant parameter that determines the long time behaviour of the system is the lyapunov exponent of the underlying linearized dynamics .",
    "exact results can be derived for white noise and for dichotomous poisson noise . when the system is coupled to the smooth ornstein - uhlenbeck process",
    ", analytical treatments have to rely on various approximations , however qualitative aspects on time - correlations are well understood .",
    "the effect of noise on the scaling behaviour is subtle  : intermittency and multiscaling can appear if the relative weight of the zero - frequency mode of noise is large enough . if low frequencies are filtered out , the noise - induced bifurcation becomes qualitatively similar to the deterministic transition .",
    "these features are difficult to extract from a perturbative analysis of the langevin equation  : they appear as divergences in the perturbative expansion which must be resummed in order to get correct results .",
    "indeed , multiscaling of the order parameter can not be revealed from a finite order truncation of the expansion .    despite the formal simplicity of the problem ,",
    "exact results have been derived only recently and many questions still remain to be addressed .",
    "for example , little is known about the relevance of the noise spectrum on barrier crossing problems and on stochastic resonance .",
    "analytical results for higher dimensional systems and for stochastic fields are rare  : such results could be relevant for the study of the trapping of quasi one - dimensional bose - einstein condensates in random potentials @xcite .",
