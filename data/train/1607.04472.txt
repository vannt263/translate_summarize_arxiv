    "savchuk and schmdgen  @xcite introduce a method to define and classify the integrable representations of certain * -algebras by an inductive construction .",
    "the original goal of this article was to clarify this method and thus make it apply to more situations .",
    "this has led me to reconsider some foundational aspects of the theory of representations of * -algebras by unbounded operators .",
    "this is best explained by formulating an induction theorem that is inspired by  @xcite .",
    "let  @xmath0 be a discrete group with unit element @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a @xmath0-graded unital * -algebra .",
    "that is , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , the _ unit fibre _  @xmath6 is a unital * -algebra .",
    "many interesting examples of this situation are studied in @xcite .",
    "a _ fell bundle _ over  @xmath0 is a family of subspaces  @xmath7 of a c*-algebra  @xmath8 ( which is not part of the data ) such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the universal choice for  @xmath8 is the _ section c*-algebra _ of the fell bundle .",
    "briefly , our main result says the following .",
    "let  @xmath11 be a c*-algebra such that `` integrable '' `` representations '' of  @xmath6 are `` equivalent '' to `` representations '' of  @xmath11 .",
    "under some technical conditions , we construct a fell bundle  @xmath12 over  @xmath0 such that `` integrable '' `` representations '' of  @xmath13 are `` equivalent '' to `` representations '' of the section c*-algebra of this fell bundle . here the words in quotation marks must be interpreted carefully to make this true .",
    "a _ representation _ of a * -algebra  @xmath13 on a hilbert @xmath14-module  @xmath15 is an algebra homomorphism  @xmath16 from  @xmath13 to the algebra of @xmath14-module endomorphisms of a dense @xmath14-submodule @xmath17 with @xmath18 for all @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the representation induces a graph topology on  @xmath21 .",
    "we restrict to _ closed _",
    "representations most of the time , that is , we require  @xmath21 to be complete in the graph topology .",
    "the difference from usual practice is that we consider representations on _ hilbert modules _ over c*-algebras . a _ representation of a c*-algebra _  @xmath8 on a hilbert module  @xmath15 is a nondegenerate * -homomorphism @xmath22 , where  @xmath23 denotes the c*-algebra of adjointable operators on  @xmath15 .",
    "the notion of `` integrability '' for representations is a choice .",
    "the class of all hilbert space representations of a * -algebra may be quite wild .",
    "hence it is customary to limit the study to some class of `` nice '' or `` integrable '' representations .",
    "for instance , for the universal enveloping algebra of the lie algebra of a lie group  @xmath0 , we may call those representations `` integrable '' that come from a unitary representation of  @xmath0 .",
    "this example suggests the name `` integrable '' representations .    in our theorem , a notion of integrability for representations of @xmath24 on all hilbert modules over all c*-algebras is fixed .",
    "a representation of  @xmath13 is called integrable if its restriction to  @xmath6 is integrable .",
    "the induction theorem describes the integrable representations of  @xmath13 in terms of integrable representations of  @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , if  @xmath6 is finitely generated and commutative , then we may call a representation  @xmath16 on a hilbert module integrable if the closure  @xmath25 is a regular , self - adjoint operator for each @xmath26 with @xmath27 ; then our theory reproduces the examples in @xcite .",
    "an `` equivalence '' between the integrable representations of a unital * -algebra  @xmath13 and the representations of a c*-algebra  @xmath8 is a family of bijections  one for each hilbert module  @xmath15 over each c*-algebra  @xmath14  between the sets of integrable representations of  @xmath13 and of representations of  @xmath8 on  @xmath15 with two extra properties , namely , compatibility with isometric intertwiners and interior tensor products ; these properties require some more definitions .",
    "first , an _ isometric intertwiner _ between two representations is a hilbert module isometry  not necessarily adjointable  between the underlying hilbert modules that restricts to a left module map between the domains of the representations . for an equivalence between integrable representations of  @xmath13 and representations of  @xmath8 we require an isometry to intertwine two representations of  @xmath8 if and only if it intertwines the corresponding integrable representations of  @xmath13 .",
    "secondly , a _ c*-correspondence _ from  @xmath28 to  @xmath29 is a hilbert @xmath29-module  @xmath30 with a representation of  @xmath28 .",
    "given such a correspondence and a hilbert @xmath28-module  @xmath15 , the interior tensor product @xmath31 is a hilbert @xmath29-module .",
    "a representation of @xmath13 or  @xmath8 on  @xmath15 induces a representation on @xmath31 .",
    "we require our bijections between integrable representations of @xmath13 and representations of  @xmath8 to be compatible with this interior tensor product construction on representations .",
    "we call  @xmath8 a",
    "_ c*-hull for the integrable representations of  @xmath13 _ , if the integrable representations of  @xmath13 are equivalent to the representations of  @xmath8 as explained above , that is , through a family of bijections compatible with isometric intertwiners and interior tensor products . the induction theorem builds a c*-hull for the integrable representations of  @xmath13 using a c*-hull for the integrable representations of  @xmath6 and assuming a further mild technical condition , which we explain below .",
    "many results of the general theory remain true if we only require the equivalence of representations to be compatible with interior tensor products and unitary * -intertwiners , that is , isomorphisms of representations ; we speak of a _",
    "weak c*-hull _ in this case .",
    "the induction theorem , however , fails for weak c*-hulls .",
    "we show this by a counterexample .",
    "some results only need the class of integrable representations to have some properties that are clearly necessary for the existence of a c*-hull or weak c*-hull , but they do not need the ( weak ) c*-hull itself .",
    "this is formalised in our notions of _ admissible _ and _ weakly admissible _ classes of representations .",
    "for example , let  @xmath13 be commutative and define integrable representations as above .",
    "let  @xmath32 be the space of characters of  @xmath13 with the topology of pointwise convergence .",
    "if  @xmath32 is locally compact and  @xmath13 is countably generated , then @xmath33 is a c*-hull for the integrable representations of  @xmath13 as defined above , that is , those representations where each  @xmath25 for @xmath20 with @xmath27 is regular and self - adjoint .",
    "if , say , @xmath34 $ ] with @xmath35 , then the c*-hull is @xmath36 . here",
    "the equivalence of representations maps a representation  @xmath16 of  @xmath37 $ ] to the functional calculus homomorphism for the regular , self - adjoint operator  @xmath38 .",
    "if  @xmath32 is not locally compact , then the integrable representations of  @xmath13 defined above still form an admissible class , but they have no c*-hull . if , say , @xmath13 is the algebra of polynomials in countably many variables , then @xmath39 , which is not locally compact .",
    "the problem of associating c*-algebras to this * -algebra has recently been studied by grundling and neeb  @xcite . from our point of view , this amounts to choosing a smaller class of `` integrable '' representations that does admit a c*-hull .",
    "we have now explained the terms in quotation marks in our induction theorem and how we approach the representation theory of * -algebras .",
    "most previous work focused either on representations on hilbert spaces or on single unbounded operators on hilbert modules .",
    "hilbert module representations occur both in the assumptions and in the conclusions of the induction theorem , and hence we can not prove it without considering representations on hilbert modules throughout .",
    "in addition , taking into account hilbert modules makes our c*-hulls unique .",
    "besides the induction theorem , the other main strand of this article are local  global principles , which aim at reducing the study of integrability for representations on general hilbert modules to representations on hilbert space .",
    "given a state  @xmath40 on the coefficient c*-algebra  @xmath14 of a hilbert module  @xmath15 , we may complete  @xmath15 to a hilbert space using  @xmath40 .",
    "thus a representation of  @xmath13 on  @xmath15 induces hilbert space representations for all states on  @xmath14 .",
    "the _ local",
    " global principle _ says that a representation of  @xmath13 on  @xmath15 is integrable if and only if these induced hilbert space representations are integrable for all states ; the _ strong _ local  global principle says the same with all states replaced by all _ pure _ states .",
    "we took these names from  @xcite .",
    "results of pierrot  @xcite show that the strong local ",
    "global principle holds for any class of integrable representations that is defined by certain types of conditions , such as the regularity and self - adjointness of  @xmath25 for some @xmath20 with @xmath27 . for instance , this covers the integrable representations of commutative * -algebras and of universal enveloping algebras of lie algebras .    in our work ,",
    "affiliation of multipliers or regularity of hilbert module operators play a role as standard ways to characterise which representations of a particular * -algebra  @xmath13 are integrable . in all examples that we treat ,",
    "the regularity of some special elements of  @xmath13 is part of the definition of its integrable representations .",
    "but some elements of  @xmath13 may well act by irregular operators in some integrable representations if  @xmath13 is not commutative .",
    "thus affiliation and regularity are important to study the integrable representations in concrete examples , but can not play a foundational role for the representation theory of _ general _ * -algebras .",
    "if  @xmath8 is generated in the sense of woronowicz  @xcite by some self - adjoint , affiliated multipliers that belong to  @xmath13 , then it is a c*-hull and the strong local",
    " global principle holds ( see theorem  [ the : woronowicz_local - global ] ) . a counterexample shows that this theorem breaks down if the generating affiliated multipliers are not self - adjoint : both the local  global principle and compatibility with isometric intertwiner fail in the counterexample .",
    "so regularity without self - adjointness seems to be too weak for many purposes .",
    "the combination of regularity and self - adjointness is an easier notion than regularity alone .",
    "a closed operator  @xmath41 is regular and self - adjoint if and only if @xmath42 is surjective for all @xmath43 , if and only if the cayley transform of  @xmath41 is unitary , if and only if  @xmath41 has a functional calculus homomorphism on  @xmath36 .",
    "now we describe the fell bundle in the induction theorem and , along the way , the further condition besides compatibility with isometric intertwiners that it needs .",
    "our input data is a graded * -algebra @xmath2 and a c*-hull  @xmath11 for the * -algebra  @xmath6 .",
    "a representation of  @xmath13 is integrable if its restriction to  @xmath6 is integrable .",
    "we seek a c*-hull for the integrable representations of  @xmath13 .    as in  @xcite",
    ", we induce representations from  @xmath6 to  @xmath13 , and this requires a positivity condition .",
    "we call representations of  @xmath6 that may be induced to  @xmath13 _ inducible_. we describe a quotient c*-algebra  @xmath44 of  @xmath11 that is a c*-hull for the inducible , integrable representations of  @xmath13 .",
    "it is the unit fibre of our fell bundle .",
    "if a representation  @xmath16 of  @xmath13 is integrable , then its restriction to  @xmath6 is integrable and inducible .",
    "thus it corresponds to a representation  @xmath45 of  @xmath44 .",
    "the identity correspondence on  @xmath44 corresponds to a particular ( `` universal '' ) inducible , integrable representation of  @xmath6 on  @xmath44 .",
    "its domain is a dense right ideal @xmath46 .",
    "the operators @xmath47 on  @xmath15 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 are adjointable .",
    "their closed linear span is the fibre  @xmath50 of our fell bundle at  @xmath51 provided  @xmath52 is faithful .",
    "the most difficult point is to prove @xmath53 for all @xmath54 ; this easily implies @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so that the subspaces @xmath57 form a fell bundle .    to prove @xmath58 , we need compatibility with isometric intertwiners and that induction maps inducible , integrable representations of  @xmath6 to _ integrable _ representations of  @xmath13 .",
    "two counterexamples show that both assumptions are necessary for the induction theorem",
    ".    fell bundles are noncommutative partial dynamical systems .",
    "more precisely , a fell bundle  @xmath12 over  @xmath0 is equivalent to an action of  @xmath0 on  @xmath44 by partial morita  rieffel equivalences ; this is made precise in  @xcite . in the examples in @xcite ,",
    "the group  @xmath0 is almost always  @xmath59 ; the c*-algebras @xmath11 and hence  @xmath44 are commutative ; and the resulting fell bundle comes from a partial action of  @xmath0 on the spectrum  @xmath60 . in these examples , the section c*-algebra is a partial crossed product .",
    "this may also be viewed as the groupoid c*-algebra of the transformation groupoid for the partial action of  @xmath0 on  @xmath60 .",
    "we show that the c*-hull  @xmath8 for the integrable representations of  @xmath13 is a _ twisted _ groupoid c*-algebra of this transformation groupoid whenever  @xmath11 is commutative .",
    "we give some criteria when the twist is absent , and examples where the twist occurs .",
    "one way to insert such twists is by rieffel deformation , using a @xmath61-cocycle on the group  @xmath0 .",
    "we show that rieffel deformation is compatible with the construction of c*-hulls .",
    "we describe commutative and noncommutative c*-hulls for the polynomial algebra  @xmath37 $ ] in  [ sec : polynomials1 ] and   [ sec : polynomials2 ] ; the noncommutative c*-hulls for  @xmath37 $ ] make very good counterexamples .",
    "we classify and study commutative c*-hulls in   [ sec : commutative_hulls ] .",
    "many results about them generalise easily to _ locally bounded _ representations .",
    "roughly speaking , these are representations where the vectors on which the representation acts by bounded operators form a core . the only examples of * -algebras for which we treat locally bounded representations in some detail are commutative ones .    through the induction theorem , the representation theory of commutative * -algebras is important even for noncommutative algebras because they often admit a grading by some group with commutative unit fibre .",
    "many examples of this are treated in detail in @xcite .",
    "we discuss untwisted and twisted weyl algebras in finitely and infinitely many generators in   [ sec : weyl_twisted ] .",
    "the twists involved are rieffel deformations .",
    "since these examples have commutative unit fibres , the resulting c*-hulls are twisted groupoid c*-algebras .",
    "as it turns out , all twists of the relevant groupoids are trivial , so that the twists do not change the representation theory of the weyl algebras up to equivalence .",
