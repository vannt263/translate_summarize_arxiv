    "<S> toroidal nuclei are however plagued with various instabilities @xcite , and the search remains elusive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found previously from the liquid - drop model that a `` rotation '' about the symmetry axis with an angular momentum @xmath4=@xmath5 above a threshold can stabilize the toroidal nucleus and can lead to a high - spin isomer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the toroidal high - spin isomer , whose large angular momentum @xmath4=@xmath5 must be generated by the alignment of individual nucleon angular momenta along the symmetry axis @xcite , provides an elegant example in quantum mechanics as how an axially - symmetric system can acquire a quantized angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the nuclear fluid in the toroidal isomeric state may be so severely distorted by the change from sphere - like geometry to the toroidal shape that it may acquire bulk properties of its own , to make it a distinct type of quantum fluid . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the toroidal high - spin isomer may be a source of energy , as its decay to the ground state can release a large amount of excitation energy and the possibility of toroidal high - spin isomers may stimulate also future reaction studies to explore their production and detection by fusion of two ions at high angular momenta @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for all these reasons , the investigation on toroidal high - spin isomers is of general interest .    in the liquid - drop model of a toroidal nucleus </S>",

    "<S> the energy @xmath9 associated with the angular momentum @xmath4 can be called the `` rotational '' energy . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the rotational energy and the coulomb energy tend to counter - balance the variation of the surface energy @xcite . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , there is an @xmath4-threshold above which the rotating toroidal nucleus can be stable against a variation of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the toroidal nucleus is stable also against axially - asymmetric sausage distortions within an @xmath4-window , when the same mass flow is maintained across the toroidal meridian . beyond the @xmath4-window , </S>",
    "<S> sausage instabilities of higher orders dominate to break the toroid into many beads @xcite .    to study toroidal high - spin states theoretically , we need a systematic way to determine the quantized @xmath4 value , which is a non - trivial function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 </S>",
