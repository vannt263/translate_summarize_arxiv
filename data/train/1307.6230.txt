    "during past decades , a remarkable overlap of such seemingly different areas in physics as condensed matter and relativistic physics took place ( for a recent review , see ref .  ) .",
    "it was especially clearly manifested in studying graphene.@xcite such well known phenomena as the klein paradox , the dynamics of a supercritical charge , and the dynamical generation of a dirac mass in a magnetic field ( magnetic catalysis ) , revealed in relativistic field theory , were first observed in studies of graphene ( see refs .  ) . in the present paper",
    ", we will consider manifestations in condensed matter of another relativistic phenomenon : the rearrangement of the fermi surface in three dimensional relativistic matter in a magnetic field .",
    "the original motivation for studying this phenomenon was its possible realization in magnetars and pulsars , and in heavy ion collisions.@xcite but as we discuss below , it could also be relevant for such new materials as dirac and weyl semimetals .",
    "dirac and weyl semimetals possess low - energy quasiparticles near the fermi surface , which are described by the dirac and weyl equation , respectively.@xcite as was established long ago , an example of a semimetal whose low - energy effective theory includes three dimensional dirac fermions is yielded by bismuth ( for reviews , see refs .  ) . on the other hand , examples of the realization of the weyl semimetals",
    "have been considered only recently.@xcite weyl semimetals , which are three dimensional analogs of graphene , present a new class of materials with nontrivial topological properties.@xcite since their electronic states in the vicinity of weyl nodes have a definite chirality , this leads to quite unique transport and electromagnetic properties of these materials .    the most interesting signatures of dirac and weyl semimetals discussed in the literature @xcite are connected with different nondissipative transport phenomena intimately related to the axial anomaly.@xcite many of them were previously suggested in studies of heavy ion collisions ( for a review , see ref .  ) .    in this paper , we will consider a different signature of dirac semimetals : a dynamical rearrangement of their fermi surfaces in a magnetic field . as we show below",
    ", this rearrangement is quite spectacular : a dirac semimetal is transformed into a weyl one .",
    "the resulting weyl semimetal has a pair of weyl nodes for each of the original dirac points .",
    "each pair of the nodes is separated by a dynamically induced ( axial ) vector @xmath0 , whose direction coincides with the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnitude of the vector @xmath1 is determined by the quasiparticle charge density , the strength of the magnetic field , and the strength of the interaction .",
    "this phenomenon of the dynamical transformation of dirac into weyl semimetals is a condensed matter analog of the previously studied dynamical generation of the chiral shift parameter in magnetized relativistic matter in refs .  .",

    "as stated in the introduction , the main goal of this paper is to show that a dynamical transformation of dirac semimetals into weyl ones can be achieved by applying an external magnetic field to the former .",
    "it is convenient , however , to start our discussion from writing down the general form of the low - energy hamiltonian for a weyl semimetal , @xmath4 where @xmath5 \\label{free - hamiltonian}\\ ] ] is the hamiltonian of the free theory , which describes two weyl nodes of opposite ( as required by the nielsen  ninomiya theorem @xcite ) chirality separated by vector @xmath0 in momentum space . in the rest of this paper , following the terminology of refs .",
    ", we will call @xmath1 the chiral shift parameter .",
    "there are two reasons for choosing this terminology .",
    "first , as eq .",
    "( [ free - hamiltonian ] ) implies , vector @xmath1 shifts the positions of weyl nodes from the origin in the momentum space and , secondly , the shift has opposite signs for fermions of different chiralities .",
    "the other notations are : @xmath6 is the fermi velocity , @xmath7 is the chemical potential , and @xmath8 are pauli matrices associated with the conduction - valence band degrees of freedom in a generic low - energy model.@xcite based on the similarity of the latter to the spin matrices in the relativistic dirac equation , we will call them pseudospin matrices .",
    "the interaction part of the hamiltonian describes the coulomb interaction , i.e. , @xmath9 in order to present our results in the most transparent way , in this study we will utilize a simpler model with a contact four - fermion interaction , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a dielectric constant and @xmath12 is a dimensionful coupling constant . as we argue in sec .",
    "[ section7 ] , such a model interaction should at least be sufficient for a qualitative description of the effect of the dynamical generation of the chiral shift parameter by a magnetic field in dirac semimetals .    before proceeding further with the analysis",
    ", we find it very convenient to introduce the four - dimensional dirac matrices in the chiral representation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the two - dimensional unit matrix , and rewrite our model hamiltonian in a relativistic form , @xmath15\\psi(\\mathbf{r } ) + \\frac{g}{2}\\int d^3r\\,\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) , \\label{free - hamiltonian - weyl - rel}\\ ] ] where , by definition , @xmath16 is the dirac conjugate spinor field , @xmath17 is the charge density operator , and the matrix @xmath18 is @xmath19 where , as is clear from the first term in the free hamiltonian ( [ free - hamiltonian ] ) , the eigenvalues of @xmath18 correspond to the node degrees of freedom .",

    "one should replace @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the vector potential and @xmath25 is the speed of light .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the dirac semimetal model in an external magnetic field has the following form : @xmath26\\psi(\\mathbf{r } ) + \\frac{g}{2}\\int d^3r\\,\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) .",

    "the reason for this is well known .",
    "the atiyah - singer theorem connects the number of the zero energy modes ( which are completely pseudospin polarized ) of the two - dimensional part of the dirac operator to the total flux of the magnetic field through the corresponding plane .",

    "this is not surprising because both of them break the chiral @xmath83 symmetry of the dirac semimetal hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - dirac - magnetic ] ) .",

    "( [ gap - m - text ] )    and ( [ gap - tilde - mu - text ] ) , we conclude that both the dirac mass @xmath43 and the parameter @xmath42 are zero in the perturbation theory .    after taking into account",
    "the gap equations ( [ gap - mu - text ] ) and ( [ gap - delta - text ] ) , the results in eqs .

    "this is generated already in the free theory and known in the literature as the topological contribution.@xcite its topological origin is related to the following fact : in the free theory , only the lll contributes to both the axial current and the axial anomaly . by combining eqs .",
    "( [ gap - delta - text ] ) and ( [ perturbative - axial - current ] ) , we find @xmath84 this is our principal result , which reflects the simple fact that at @xmath85 ( i.e. , nonzero charge density ) , the absence of the chiral shift is not protected by any additional symmetries in the normal phase of a dirac metal in a magnetic field . indeed , in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field pointing in the @xmath40 direction , the rotational @xmath86 symmetry in the model",
    "is explicitly broken down to the @xmath87 symmetry of rotations around the @xmath40 axis .",
    "the dynamically generated chiral shift parameter @xmath1 also points in the same direction and does not break the leftover @xmath87 symmetry .",
    "the same is true for the discrete symmetries : while the parity @xmath88 is preserved , all other discrete symmetries , charge conjugation @xmath89 , time reversal @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , are broken .",
    "last but not least , the chiral shift does not break the chiral @xmath27 symmetry considered in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] .",
    "this implies that the dynamical chiral shift is necessarily generated in the normal phase of a dirac semimetal in a magnetic field , and the latter is transformed into a weyl semimetal .    in the phase with a dynamically generated chiral shift @xmath1 ,",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion relations , i.e. , @xmath95 , are determined by the following landau - level energies ( recall that we assume that the magnetic field points in the @xmath40 direction ) : @xmath96 where @xmath97 corresponds to different weyl nodes .",
    "the corresponding dispersion relations are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] . note",
    "a qualitatively different character ( compared to higher landau levels ) of the dispersion relations in the lll given by the straight lines whose signs of slope correlate with the weyl nodes .",
    "of course , this correlation is due to the complete polarization of quasiparticle pseudospins in the lll . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] , the effect of the chiral shift is not only to shift the relative position of the weyl nodes in momentum space , but also to induce a chiral asymmetry of the fermi surface.@xcite",
    "the magnetic catalysis phenomenon , which takes place for planar as well as three - dimensional relativistic charged fermions because of the dimensional reduction,@xcite implies that at vanishing @xmath47 , the ground state in the model at hand is characterized by a nonzero dirac mass @xmath43 that spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "( for the corresponding studies in graphene , see ref .  .",
    ")    such a vacuum state can withstand a finite stress due to a nonzero chemical potential .",
    "however , as we discuss below , when @xmath47 exceeds a certain critical value @xmath98 , the chiral symmetry restoration and a new ground state are expected .",
    "the new state is characterized by a nonvanishing chiral shift parameter @xmath1 and a nonzero axial current in the direction of the magnetic field . since no symmetry of the theory",
    "is broken , this state is the _ normal _ phase of the magnetized matter that happens to have a rather rich chiral structure .",
    "this phase was considered in the previous section .",
    "let us describe this transition in more detail .",
    "the value of the dynamical dirac mass @xmath43 in the vacuum state can be easily calculated following the same approach as in ref .  .",
    "at weak coupling , in particular , we can use the following expression for the chiral condensate : @xmath99 obtained in the limit of a small mass ( which is consistent with the weak coupling approximation ) , using the gauge invariant proper - time regularization . here",
    "the ultraviolet momentum cutoff @xmath100 can be related , for example , to the value of lattice spacing @xmath101 as follows : @xmath102 .",
    "finally , by taking into account gap equation ( [ gap - m - text ] ) , we arrive at the solution for the dynamical mass , @xmath103 this zero - temperature , nonperturbative solution exists for @xmath104 .",
    "the free energies of the two types of states , i.e. , the nonperturbative state with a dynamically generated dirac mass ( and no chiral shift ) and the perturbative state with a nonzero chiral shift ( and no dirac mass ) become equal at about @xmath105 .",
    "this is analogous to the clogston relation in superconductivity.@xcite    at the critical value @xmath106 , a first order phase transition takes place .",
    "indeed , both these solutions coexist at @xmath104 , and while for @xmath107 the nonperturbative ( gapped ) phase with a chiral condensate is more stable , the normal ( gapless ) phase becomes more stable at @xmath108 .",
    "note that at @xmath109 the chemical potential is irrelevant in the gapped phase : the charge density is absent there . on the other hand , at any nonzero chemical potential , there is a nonzero charge density in the normal ( gapless ) phase .",
    "therefore , at @xmath106 , there is a phase transition with a jump in the charge density , which is a clear manifestation of a first order phase transition .",
    "it is instructive to compare the states in the magnetized dirac semimetals and graphene .",
    "first of all , we would like to point out that the chiral shift is a three - dimensional analog of the haldane mass,@xcite which plays an important role in the dynamics of the quantum hall effect in graphene .",
    "indeed , in the formalism of the four - component dirac fields in graphene , the haldane mass condensate is described by the same vacuum expectation value as that of the axial current in three dimensions:@xcite @xmath110\\ ] ] for a magnetic field pointing in the @xmath40 direction , which is orthogonal to the graphene plane ; cf .",
    "( [ axial - current - text ] ) .",
    "moreover , similar to the solution with the chiral shift , the solution with the haldane mass ( with the same sign for both spin - up and spin - down quasiparticles ) describes the normal phase : it is a singlet with respect to the @xmath111 symmetry , which is a graphene analog of the chiral group in dirac and weyl semimetals .",
    "also , in graphene , there is a phase transition similar to that described in the previous section .",
    "it happens when the lll is completely filled.@xcite in other words , the quantum hall state with the filling factor @xmath2 in graphene is associated with the normal phase containing the haldane mass .",
    "as is well known , the haldane mass leads to the chern - simons term in an external electromagnetic field.@xcite this feature reflects a topological nature of the state with the filling factor @xmath2 in a graphene . as was recently shown in ref .",
    ", the chiral shift term @xmath112 leads to an induced chern - simons term of the form @xmath113 in weyl semimetals [ here @xmath114 is a four - dimensional vector @xmath115 .",
    "therefore it should also be generated in dirac semimetals in a magnetic field .",
    "note , however , the following principle difference between them : while in weyl semimetals the chiral shift @xmath1 is present in the free hamiltonian , it is dynamically generated in the normal phase of dirac semimetals in a magnetic field [ see eq .",
    "( [ bvalue ] ) ] . like in graphene",
    ", the generation of the chern - simons term implies a topological nature of the normal state in this material.@xcite",
    "in the present paper , we considered manifestations of a relativistic phenomenon , the rearrangement of the fermi surface in three - dimensional matter in a magnetic field , in a dirac semimetal .",
    "it was shown that its normal phase at a nonzero charge density and in a magnetic field has a nontrivial chiral structure : it is a weyl semimetal with a pair of weyl nodes for each of the original dirac points .",
    "the nodes are separated by a dynamically induced chiral shift that is directed along the magnetic field .",
    "the phase transition between the normal phase and the phase with chiral symmetry breaking is revealed , and the rearrangement of the fermi surface accompanying this phase transition is described.@xcite    although we studied a simple model with a contact four - fermion interaction , we believe that the present qualitative results apply equally well to more realistic models .",
    "the studies in the relativistic nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model ( with a contact interaction ) on the one hand @xcite and in qed on the other @xcite strongly support the validity of this statement .",
    "namely , the dynamical generation of the chiral shift in a magnetic field and at a nonzero fermion density is a universal phenomenon .    in the present study we analyzed the simplest model",
    ": it is isotropic ( in the absence of the magnetic field ) , has no gap ( i.e. , no bare dirac mass ) , and no zeeman term for spin . in real materials , such as bismuth,@xcite the presence of an anisotropy , a gap , and the zeeman term for spin should be taken into account .",
    "this task , as well as the generalization of the study to the case of nonzero temperature , is outside the scope of the present paper and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "here we just want to mention that the effects of a bare dirac mass term and temperature were studied in the njl model in ref .  .",
    "it was shown there that the chirality remains a good approximate quantum number even for massive fermions in the vicinity of the fermi surface , provided the mass is sufficiently small , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "as for the temperature effects,@xcite an interesting feature of the chiral shift is that it is insensitive to the temperature when @xmath117 , and _ increases _ with temperature @xmath118",
    ".    a natural extension of this work would be the study of the phase diagram of a weyl semimetal in a magnetic field and a nonzero charge density .",
    "because of a built - in chiral shift in the hamiltonian of such a material , one may expect that its phase with chiral symmetry breaking , realized at zero ( or low ) density , should be inhomogeneous , possibly , a larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrel ( loff ) like one ( cf . refs .  ) .",
    "we expect that a first order phase transition between the normal phase and the phase with chiral symmetry breaking will take place in that case too .",
