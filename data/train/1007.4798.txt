    "2(b ) , we employed a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) to realize the ultrafast photon router .",
    "it consisted of two 50:50 bss , mirrors , and most importantly two electro - optic modulators ( eoms ) with one in each arm of the mzi , where two rubidium titanate phosphate ( rtp ) crystals were used as the electro - optic material .",
    "this design of the router has several advantages : ( 1 ) it can route incoming photons independent of their polarizations , which is crucial for certain tasks . in the schemes of polarization - entanglement - based quantum cryptography  @xcite and quantum computation with polarization encoded photonic qubits  @xcite , any polarization - dependent routing will destroy the polarization entanglement and hence defeat the original goal of achieving communication security and computation speed - up provided by the entanglement .",
    "for instance , in polarization - entanglement - based quantum cryptography described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the source is located at alice s laboratory , and out of each pair of entangled photons , one is sent to alice and the other to bob . in a multiplexed scenario , many sources produce polarization - entangled photon pairs .",
    "the trigger photons are sent to and measured by alice .",
    "depending on the outcome of her polarization measurement , she sends an electronic signal to the routers for multiplexing the photons which will be sent to bob . multiplexed systems with our router can enhance the key rate while keeping the quantum bit error rate ( due to the multiple pair generations ) constant .",
    "whatever critical key rate is needed at the receiver , @xmath6-spdc multiplexing extends the possible communication distance between the two parties by the additional distance @xmath31 compared to 1-spdc , where @xmath32 is the @xmath33 decay distance in the transmission channel ( valid for both free space and fiber ) . in a 1550 nm fiber - based cryptography system",
    ", a 4-spdc multiplexing system could increase the available distance by @xmath34 .",
    "note however , whether one needs entangled photons depends on what kind of quantum - information processing task the photon will be used for later on .",
    "one does not need entanglement for the operation of the multiplexing procedure itself or for using multiplexing in the bennett and brassard quantum cryptography protocol  @xcite , as the latter is not based on entanglement . then one can also use a mixture of polarization - correlated product states as the input of the multiplexing scheme . ( 2 )",
    "a similar design has been widely used in the photonic industry to implement intensity modulators  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the scheme demonstrated here has the potential to be implemented with the mature technology of integrated optics .",
    "the optical axes of both rtp crystals in the eoms were oriented along @xmath35 and the voltages applied to them were always of the same amplitude but with opposite polarities .",
    "if the opposite half - wave voltages ( hwvs ) were applied to the eoms , a @xmath36 phase shift would be introduced to the mzi .",
    "we locked the phase of the mzi at @xmath37 when the eoms were off .",
    "this 0 phase is defined via the condition that all the photons that enter from input b exit into c@xmath29 , and c into b@xmath29 ( fig .",
    "therefore , when the eoms were on and were applied with opposite hwvs , the photons that entered from input b exited into b@xmath29 , and c into c@xmath29 .",
    "the rising and falling times of our router for a @xmath36-phase modulation are each about @xmath38 ns . ( this could be reduced to tens of picoseconds with state - of - art integrated photonics devices  @xcite . )",
    "the recharger time of the high - voltage driver of our eoms is about @xmath39 ns . the traveling time in the used coaxial cables is also a few nanoseconds .",
    "together , this in principle allows a repetition rate of our router of approximately @xmath40 mhz .",
    "( note that the dead time of trigger apds is about @xmath41 ns , which will limit the operating frequency of small - scale multiplexing systems . )",
    "the visibility of @xmath36-phase modulation ( routing visibility ) , @xmath42 , was above 95%",
    ". it is defined as @xmath43 for spatial mode b as the input , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the output intensities of spatial mode b@xmath29 of phase @xmath37 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "similar results were obtained for spatial mode c as the input .",
    "therefore , this photon router meets the two requirements : short response time ( compared to the recharging time of our eoms ) and high routing visibility .",
    "see appendix c for further details of this ultrafast photon router .    the 4-spdc multiplexing system [ fig .",
    "2(c ) ] was operated as follows .",
    "we detected photons 1 and 4 in the modes of 1h , 1v , 4h and 4v , and sent the electrical signals from the detectors through a custom - built programmable logic to the router .",
    "when the detector on mode 1h or 1v fired , the eoms in the mzi were switched on with hwv and thus the phase of the mzi was switched to @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , photon 2 was routed to spatial mode b@xmath29 .",
    "when the detector on mode 4h or 4v fired , the eoms in the mzi were switched off , and the phase of the mzi remained at 0 . therefore , photon 3 was routed to spatial mode b@xmath29 . in the last step ,",
    "an additional electro - optical modulator ( eom3 ) placed in spatial mode b@xmath29 acted as a polarization router and performed an active polarization rotation on the output photon , before it was finally cleaned by using a pbs .",
    "however , due to limited resources , we bypassed eom3 and performed this operation with post - selection .",
    "note that introducing eom3 would only reduce the routing visibility by at most 1% ( with a polarization switching visibility of at least 99% )  @xcite .",
    "in order that our _ m_-spdc source is useful in photonic quantum - information processing , it is most important that it performs well in hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) two - photon interference  @xcite , which is at the heart of many protocols and has been demonstrated with different systems and schemes .",
    "for instance , interference between consecutive photons emitted from the same quantum dots  @xcite , between photons from different donor impurities  @xcite and molecules  @xcite , as well as between two independent spdc sources  @xcite have been shown . at present , in terms of the count rate and quality of the independent single photons , femtosecond - pulsed spdc is still better than other schemes and has been successfully used in multiphoton experiments in the past . a single - photon source based on our scheme is suitable for high quality hom two - photon interference and enables multiphoton experiments  @xcite .",
    "the present multiplexing scheme includes the photon router as the only additional complexity which was not involved in earlier experiments .",
    "since the path length difference of the mzi can be controlled very accurately , the router will not introduce any temporal distinguishability , even though it is based on first - order interference which is wavelength sensitive ( nm range ) .",
    "in contrast , most of the photonic quantum - computation experiments ( c - phase gate  @xcite , entanglement swapping  @xcite , etc . ) rely on second - order interference , which is coherence length sensitive ( depends on the context , but at least more than @xmath46  nm ) . in order to empirically exclude possible degradations of the indistinguishability due to the router , we have performed hom two - photon interference experiments with the router .",
    "experimentally , we use a pair of photons generated from one source and send it to the router .",
    "we vary the path - length difference between these two photons with a motorized translation stage mounted on one of the fiber coupling stages and measure the twofold coincidences between two detectors placed directly behind two outputs of the router [ b@xmath29 and c@xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the phase of the mzi and hence the reflectivity ( and transmissivity ) of the router is varied by applying different voltages on the eoms . in case of a @xmath47 phase ,",
    "the router becomes a balanced bs and the distinguishability of two input photons spatial modes is erased . in consequence ,",
    "the minimum of the coincidence counts occurs for the optimal temporal overlap ( with the help of suitable individual fiber delays ) of the two photons , and hom two - photon interference with a visibility of @xmath48 can be observed ( red circles in fig .",
    "[ fighom ] ) . in case of a @xmath37 phase",

    "[ fighom ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with complementarity , where in principle no hom interference can be observed .",
    "in addition , we have compared the results when using the router with those when using a normal free - space bs : quantitatively identical results have been obtained ( within the error bars ) . these hom experiments together with the earlier works  @xcite demonstrate the suitability of the multiplexed photons for scalable quantum information processing .",

    "in an array , @xmath6 _ sequentially _ pumped hspss , based on spdc , are coupled with @xmath65 photon routers .",
    "since the array of spdc sources is pumped sequentially , the source with the shortest path provides the first chance for getting a single photon , the next longer provides the next chance , and so on .",
    "the routers are operated in a way such that once they are activated by the trigger detector fired in a particular path , they block the outputs of all the other sources . therefore , the source with the shortest path has `` priority '' in the array .",
    "the overall probability of obtaining one and only one output single photon out of the whole array is as follows : @xmath66where @xmath67 is the probability of generating @xmath37 output photons from an individual spdc source .",
    "analogously , the probability of obtaining more than one output photon is : @xmath68therefore , the signal to noise ratio of obtaining one output single photon from this array equals that of a single spdc source : @xmath69the probability of obtaining one output single photon is enhanced by a gain factor of : @xmath70where the approximation at the end holds for @xmath71 .    in any experimental setup , photon losses in the routers",
    "decrease the performance of the multiplexing scheme .",
    "we now analyze the influence of these losses quantitatively .",
    "we consider the case where the mean photon pair number @xmath3 is much smaller than 1 .",
    "then , @xmath17 is close to 1 and thus the gain becomes @xmath72 [ as long as @xmath73 . due to the cascaded setup",
    ", however , using @xmath6 spdc sources means that the output photon has to travel through @xmath74 path routers ( assuming @xmath75 is an integer number ) and hence has an increasing chance of being lost .",
    "the output photon s transmission through all @xmath76 path routers be denoted as @xmath77 . in order to have an advantage over a single photon source , the gain @xmath15 has to overcompensate the loss such that the total gain",
    ", @xmath78 is larger than 1 .",
    "this leads to the generic condition @xmath79 .",
    "then , @xmath80 is increasing with @xmath6 and there is no upper bound . in case",
    "the transmission through all path routers is the same , and each single router transmission is denoted as @xmath58 , the output photon s total transmission through the routers is @xmath81 .",
    "the total gain @xmath82 has to be larger than 1 , which leads to the condition that the transmission per path router must fulfill @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , multiplexing is advantageous over a single - photon source if and only if the loss of each individual path router is smaller than @xmath64 ( under the assumption of small mean photon pair number ) .",
    "losses in the routers do build up but are then overcompensated by the gain of the multiplexing .    in our hybrid experimental scheme ,",
    "two different kinds of routers are needed , because we employ the polarization and the path degrees of freedom . in an @xmath6-spdc arrangement utilizing polarization and path ,",
    "there are only @xmath83 path routers ( in our case , only one mzi because @xmath84 ) , and it is sufficient to have one polarization router ( in our scheme , eom3 ) at the end of the array .",

    "when we denote the transmission of each path router by @xmath86 and the transmission of the polarization router by @xmath87 , the total transmission of the hybrid multiplexed system is @xmath88 .",

    "the uv pulses successively passed through two bbo crystals to generate two polarization entangled photon pairs ( photons 1 and 2 , and photons 3 and 4 ) in spatial modes a and b , and c and d via type - ii spontaneous parametric down - conversion respectively , as shown in fig .",

    "this difference eventually gives the difference in the correlation functions and the count rates of each source .",

    "the 2-spdc ( 4-spdc ) data were obtained by averaging the @xmath30 functions and summing the counts of two ( four ) 1-spdc sources .",
    "we used a mzi to realize the ultrafast photon router .",
    "the performance of this router strongly depends on the phase stability of the mzi . to achieve that",
    ", we built the interferometer in an enclosed box made by acoustic isolation materials in order to stabilize the phase passively .",
    "additionally , an active phase stabilization system has also been implemented .",
    "this was accomplished by using an auxiliary beam from a power - stabilized he - ne laser counter - propagating through the whole mzi with a little transversal displacement from the signal beam , which picked up the phase fluctuation of the interferometer . after passing through the interferometer ,",
    "the intensity fluctuation of the he - ne laser beam was measured with a silicon photon detector and the signal was fed into an analog proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) regulator .",
    "a ring piezotransducer attached to one of the mirrors in the mzi was controlled by this pid regulator and compensated the phase fluctuation actively .",
    "the insertion loss of this router and fiber delays was about 90@xmath100 , which was mainly due to the single - mode fiber coupling , lossy narrow - band interference filters ( in spatial modes b@xmath29 and c@xmath29 , 1  nm fwhm , about 70% peak transmission ) and fresnel loss on various optical elements . the most straight - forward step to improving the transmission of the router is to use high peak transmission and broadband interference filters . with a 95% peak transmission and 3-nm fwhm interference filter ,",
    "we have measured the total transmission throughput of the router , including the delay fibers and correlation function measurement setup , to be more than 25% .",
    "note that one can engineer the interactions between the pump and nonlinear crystals and match the group velocities of the pump and down - converted photons  @xcite . by employing this novel technique",
    ", one can generate pure single photons without using narrow - band filters , which potentially allows us to further enhance the transmission throughput to be more than 50% .",

    "thereby , every photon mode is represented in a fock space from 0 to 4 excitations , and all unitary operations are connected hamiltonians expressed within the full hilbert space .",
    "hence , all higher order photon terms are intrinsically taken into account , up to the natural cutoff from the fock space . through numerical simulation",
