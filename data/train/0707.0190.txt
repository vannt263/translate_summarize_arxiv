    "with the release of wmap-3yr temperature @xcite and polarization data @xcite , the standard @xmath4cdm cosmological model has passed another rigorous set of tests , being validated once again @xcite . in this era of precision cosmology",
    ", the early universe is playing an increasingly more important role as a laboratory where physics not accessible on earth can be tested and verified .",
    "thus , cosmology became an excellent tool to answer to many questions of fundamental physics , among which the time variation of fundamental constants of nature , predicted as observational consequences of some currently preferred unification theories @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting case is the fine structure constant @xmath5 , possible time variations being already reported from geophysical and astronomical observations .    from the oklo natural nuclear reactor in gabon ,",
    "the relative time variation of @xmath5 has been obtained as @xmath6 at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "terrestrial laboratory measurements give the constraint @xmath8 based on comparisons of rates between clocks with different atomic numbers during 140 days of observations @xcite .    while the results presented above are only upper limits of @xmath9 , the estimations of its actual value have been firstly computed from spectral analysis of high - redshift quasar absorption systems .",
    "some of the reported values are @xmath10 for a redshift range @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , these determinations being a confirmation of the expectation that the fine structure constant is a nondecreasing function of time . from this point of view , the result @xmath13 ppm for @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite , is controversial .",
    "in fact , there are also many other contradictory results which , perhaps , may be validated if the fine structure constant would not only be time dependent but also had a spatial variation .",
    "the cmb presents the advantage of probing directly the decoupling epoch ( @xmath16 ) when the @xmath5 variations from its current value are expected to be more important and therefore , more easy to test .",
    "a value of @xmath5 different from @xmath17 at the epoch of recombination changes the ionization evolution at that epoch , inducing effects on the cmb anisotropies observed today .    in the last years",
    "several groups have analyzed the variation of fine structure constant at recombination using cmb measurements .",
    "a lower value of @xmath5 at recombination epoch compared with its present value , was taken into account as a possibility to solve the disagreement between the flat cosmological model and the bbn predictions on the one side and the first doppler peak position and the secondary peaks amplitudes in cmb power spectra obtained by boomerang and maxima on the other side .",
    "negative values of few percent for @xmath9 have been reported from boomerang and maxima data analysis @xcite and from boomerang , dasi and cobe data analysis @xcite .    from the analysis of the first year wmap data ,",
    "a @xmath18 interval @xcite was reported . using the same data togheter with hst hubble key project , but considering simultaneous time variations of both @xmath5 and the electron mass @xmath19 , and using a different analysis method ,",
    "has been obtained the interval @xmath20 when only @xmath5 varies @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the wmap-3yr cmb data are being analyzed in order to find new limits on the @xmath5 value at recombination , and the corresponding limits on the recombination redshift .    in section 2",
    "it is reviewed the standard recombination process and are described the changes involved by a different value of the fine structure constant at recombination .",
    "section 3 presents the results of the analysis of wmap-3yr data in the context of the recombination process affected by time varying fine structure constant .    in section 4",
    "are summarized the conclusions of the work .",
    "it is well known the effect of changing the value of the fine structure constant on the energy levels of hydrogen atom and , therefore , on the photon frequencies corresponding to the transitions between two such levels . as a consequence , a change in @xmath5 value will change the dynamics of the hydrogen recombination process in the universe , which affects the cmb fluctuations observed today . as the cmb primary anisotropies probe the recombination epoch , it is natural to consider imposing limits on possible variation in @xmath5 value at the recombination epoch relative to present value using cmb anisotropy data .    in the following i",
    "briefly review the hydrogen and helium recombination process and the implications of non - standard value of @xmath5 , neglecting the impact on helium .    before recombination",
    ", the photon gas was coupled to electron - baryon fluid through thomson scattering on free electrons , the cross section for this process being given by @xcite    @xmath21    the cmb formation followed the recombination process , when the photons became free particles after electrons have been captured by ions .    for modeling the recombination process i used the treatment implemented in the recfast code @xcite .",
