    "the term @xmath57 ( coulomb repulsive force ) in @xmath58 ( velocity of shell with respect to stationary observer ) indicates that charge reduces velocity of the shell with respect to stationary observer .",
    "this velocity also depends on position of the observer , whether the observer is located inside or outside the shell .",
    "further , eq.([18 ] ) implies that charge parameter increases the effective potential @xmath59 . in coming sections",
    ", we shall see that throughout the dynamics of shell ( composed of either massless or massive scalar field ) , charge parameter reduces and increases velocity of the shell with respect to stationary observer and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "thus initially the velocity of the shell with respect to stationary observer in the rn background is slower as compared to the schwarzschild case ( as shown in figure * 1 * ) .",
    "we conclude that electrostatic repulsive force in rn background tries to balance with the gravitational force due to the shell and hence the shell velocity with respect to stationary observer is slow in this case as compared to uncharged case .    in order to study the dynamics of scalar field shell",
    ", we specify that the perfect fluid is generated by a scalar field .",
    "the energy density and the pressure of the scalar field can be written as @xmath60 , \\quad p=\\frac{1}{2}[{\\phi}_{,~\\nu } { \\phi}^{,~\\nu } -2v(\\phi)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the potential term which contributes to provide mass of the scalar field .",

    "thus eq.([19 ] ) leads to @xmath64,\\quad p=\\frac{1}{2}[{\\dot{\\phi}^2}-2v(\\phi)].\\ ] ] in terms of the scalar field , the integrated total energy density of the shell at some time is @xmath65.\\ ] ] using eqs.([23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) in eq.([16 ] ) , we get @xmath66 this is the klien - gordon ( kg ) equation , @xmath67 , in coordinate system of the shell metric ( 4 ) . in terms of the scalar field ,",
    "the effective potential is @xmath68 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we solve the kg equation ( [ 25 ] ) and equation of motion ( [ 17 ] ) ( with eq.([26 ] ) ) simultaneously for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in this case , the exact solution is not possible .",
    "we solve these equations numerically by assuming the following initial conditions : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the graphs of these equations for the set of initial data are shown in figure * 2*. the left graph shows the behavior of the shell radius @xmath2 in which upper and lower curves represent the expanding and collapsing shell , respectively .",
    "the right graph is the behavior of scalar field whose upper and lower curves represent the collapsing and expanding shell , respectively . in case of collapse ( upper curve ) ,",
    "scalar field density @xmath63 goes on increasing while in case of expansion ( lower curve ) , this comes to a point on @xmath21-axis implying that scalar field decays to zero value in this case .",
    "a scalar field becomes massless , when scalar potential , @xmath73 , is zero . in this case",
    ", the kg equation reduces to @xmath74 whose solution is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is an integration constant .",
    "thus the equation of motion ( [ 17 ] ) with eq.([26 ] ) takes the form @xmath77    we define the following two parameters : @xmath78=m_+-m_-,\\quad\\overline{m}=\\frac{m_++m_-}{2}.\\ ] ] using these in eq.([32 ] ) , it follows that @xmath79 where @xmath80}{2{\\pi}{\\omega}^2 } \\right)^2r^4+\\left(\\frac{q}{r}\\right)^2-\\frac{2\\overline { m}}{r } -\\frac{\\pi^2{\\omega}^4}{r^{6}}.\\ ] ]    for the initial data of the shell , the left graph in figure * 3 * shows the increase and decrease in shell radius implying the expansion and collapse of the massless scalar field shell .",
    "thus a massless scalar shell may expand or collapse depending on the sign of velocity ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) of the shell with respect to stationary observer .",
    "the behavior of the potential depends on the number of roots of the potential .",
    "if there is no root then the scalar field shell either expands indefinitely or collapses to a zero size from some finite value .",
    "if there is one non - degenerate root then the shell expands to infinity or contracts to some finite size . for one degenerate root",
    ", the shell will be in an unstable equilibrium or collapses to form a black hole or naked singularity @xcite .",
    "the graphical representation of the effective potential with fixed parameteric values of the model is shown in figures * 4 , 5*. both graphs for varying @xmath81 and @xmath82 in figure * 4 * and the left graph in figure * 5 * show that the effective potential diverges for initial values of @xmath2 and then @xmath83 as @xmath84 . in these cases",
    ", the shell expands to infinity or collapses to zero size . the right graph in figure",
    "* 5 * shows that the effective potential has one root and there occurs unstable situation , after which potential diverges negatively and shell expands or collapses .",
    "the cases in which collapse occurs , the shell collapses to zero size by forming a curvature singularity at which intrinsic ricci scalar of the shell , @xmath85 , diverges .",
    "in this case , we discuss the motion of a scalar field for which potential term , @xmath73 is determined by taking @xmath1 as an explicit function of @xmath2 . from eq.([23 ] ) , we get @xmath86 also , from eqs.([14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , we get @xmath87 here we use @xmath1 as an explicit function of @xmath2 , @xcite i.e. , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are constants . inserting this value of @xmath1 in eq.([38a ] ) , it follows that    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is constant of integration .",
    "notice that the above equations satisfy the conservation equation ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "further , applying the values of @xmath1 and @xmath47 in eq.([38 ] ) , we get @xmath93 these equations satisfy the kg equation ( [ 25 ] ) . using eqs.([38])-([40 ] ) in ( [ 26 ] ) , we have @xmath94 where @xmath95    the behavior of effective potential for massive scalar field shell is shown in figure *",
    "6*. the left graph is effective potential for massive scalar field ( eq.([41 ] ) ) for @xmath96 and remaining parameters are fixed as in the massless scalar field case .",
    "this implies that @xmath97 as @xmath98 , the massive shell collapses to zero size forming a curvature singularity .",
    "the right graph represents effective potential for massive scalar field shell for different values of @xmath54 .",
    "there appear oscillations in the system .",
    "there exist such values of charge parameter for which scalar field shell executes an oscillatory motion .",
    "the oscillations occur at two points where @xmath59 cuts the horizontal axis at more than one point .",
    "the values of @xmath2 for which @xmath99 are shown in right graph of figure * 6 * yielding zero velocity .",
    "this implies that the shell stops for a moment and then expands or collapses . during the collapsing phase at minimum values of the radius , the tangential pressure reaches its maximum values while during the expansion",

    ", scalar field shell performs the oscillatory motion .",

    "in this paper , we have examined the dynamical behavior of the scalar field thin shell . using the israel formalism ,",
    "the equations of motion have been formulated by taking the internal and external regions to the boundary surface as rn solution .",
    "the equations of motion are originally derived for perfect fluid and then are written in terms of scalar field .",
    "the complete dynamics of the thin shell is described by the equation of motion ( [ 17 ] ) and the kg equation ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "the exact solution of these equations can not be found , however can be solved numerically .",
    "firstly , we have solved these equations by using the scalar field potential as quadratic potential .",
    "this solution is shown in figures * 1 , 2 * which represents the collapsing and expanding scalar field shell .",
    "it has been found that scalar field decays out in the case of expansion while it grows in the case of collapse .    to analyze further , we have taken massless scalar field and a massive scalar field with @xmath1 as an explicit function of @xmath2 . in the case of massless scalar field",
    ", it has been found that the shell radius is an increasing or decreasing function of the proper time implying that the shell either collapses or expands . in this case , the effective potential ( figures * 3 - 5 * ) predicts that shell can collapse to zero size by forming a curvature singularity or can expand to infinity .",
    "for the massive scalar field case with @xmath1 as an explicit function of @xmath2 , we have evaluated the scalar field potential instead of taking it as quadratic .",
    "it has been found that the shell radius behaves like the massless scalar field and the effective potential ( figure * 6 * ) diverges negatively as the radius of the shell approaches to zero and oscillating behavior is noted in this case .",
    "this indicates that the shell collapses to zero size forming a curvature singularity .",
    "there is also bouncing behavior of the shell in this case . in the both ( massless and massive scalar field ) cases ,",
    "when shell collapses , the edge of the shell coincides with the horizons of the interior black hole .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have found that there are three possible phases ( expanding , collapsing and oscillating ( bouncing ) ) during the dynamics of the scalar field in the present configuration .",
    "when shell expands , it continues expanding forever with constant velocity as the boundary surface is described by the spatially homogenous spacetime . in case of collapse , a shell collapses to zero size forming a curvature singularity at @xmath100 , where intrinsic ricci scalar @xmath85 , diverges . also , the turning ( bouncing ) points occur when @xmath101 at more than one value of @xmath2 . in this case",
