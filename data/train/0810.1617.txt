    "our understanding of the very early universe has settled down over the last several years to give , on balance , a broadly consistent picture . in this _ concordance _ model , an adiabatic perturbation is synthesized on superhorizon scales during an early epoch of inflation and is converted by gravitational collapse into the observed distribution of baryons and cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "it is generally accepted that this simple timeline is sufficient to explain the vast majority of observational data .",
    "a zoo of optional components can be added to improve the fit to certain small anomalies in the data , or to provide an origin for features of our macroscopic world which are presently without a theoretical rationale .",
    "examples of these optional features are scalar isocurvature modes ( which may source non - gaussianities in the temperature anistropy @xcite ) , vector modes ( which may source statistical anisotropy @xcite ) , or tensor gravitational waves .",
    "all of these must be subdominant to the adiabatic perturbation .",
    "we usually assume that these optional extras can be added or taken away without penalty",
    ". however , if they mediate sufficiently dramatic processes then we must remember that the observable adiabatic fluctuation will couple to all of them via loop corrections . in this paper",
    "the loop corrections arising from an especially interesting optional addition are studied , namely a varying electromagnetic[multiblock footnote omitted ] coupling which is mediated by interaction with a collection of light scalar fields . among other effects ,",
    "a varying coupling of this sort could be responsible for generating a primordial magnetic field .",
    "such magnetic fields are required by observation @xcite and although a number of possible formation mechanisms are known ",
    "see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for a non - inflationary example their large - scale coherence and homogeneity hints at an inflationary origin parallel with the origin of the primordial density fluctuation .",
    "what can we hope to learn from the study of such loop effects ?",
    "one motivation is that , despite increasing high - quality experimental data which suggests the simplest predictions of inflation are a good fit for observation , it is still unclear whether inflation is the right model of microphysics or simply a good parametrization of an approximately gaussian , scale - invariant and adiabatic spectrum .",
    "one way to approach this question is to study the leading departures from gaussianity , as measured by the bispectrum and trispectrum .",
    "non - gaussian statistics have received considerable attention over the last several years .",
    "indeed , recent experimental results hint that it may be possible to discriminate among different microphysical models using this technique @xcite .",
    "such studies fall into the general framework of non - linear perturbation theory .",
    "however , departures of the observable adiabatic fluctuation from exact gaussianity are not the only effect we can hope to probe using this tool . in a quantum mechanical world which includes gravity",
    "we must expect the adiabatic fluctuation to couple to all other degrees of freedom which were light enough to be excited during the inflationary era .",
    "this point has been emphasized in recent work by weinberg @xcite .",
    "if inflation does more for us than merely generate the observed density fluctuation  and if we are lucky  it may be possible to probe whatever other processes were in progress during inflation , provided they were sufficiently dramatic to leave traces in the inflationary observables . the analysis given in this paper",
    "can be thought of as an exploratory step in this direction .",
    "there are other motivations .",
    "if we are to have confidence in our predictions , it is necessary to maintain control over the theoretical tools which we use .",
    "this will become of increasing significance as the data improve and we pass from a qualitative to a quantitative description of the earliest times , excluding some models as possible theories of the early universe while promoting others as a better match for observation .",
    "the key criterion here is stability of the perturbative series which is used to extract observables from the lagrangian , a question which has already attracted attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "several potential sources of instability exist . increasing orders of perturbation theory",
    "are typically suppressed by powers of the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the energy scale of inflation and @xmath2 is the planck mass .",
    "however , perturbation theory can in principle contain instabilities which scale like a positive power of the scale factor @xmath4 during inflation .",
    "if such `` fast '' divergences are present then they will rapidly overwhelm any powers of @xmath5 and render perturbation theory unstable after a short time  generally too short to be of any use in extracting predictions for relics of the early universe which are visible at the present day .",
    "alternatively there may be large corrections which come from a sensitivity to physics in the ultra - violet , or from some other hierarchy which exists in the theory .",
    "the first possibility was studied by armendariz - picon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , whereas an example of the latter , which was studied by leblond & shandera @xcite , is the relative hierarchy @xmath6 between the speed of sound and the speed of light .",
    "whatever the source of large hierarchies which overwhelms the smallness of @xmath5 , it is important to emphasize that an instability in perturbation theory does not necessarily imply that anything untoward is taking place .",
    "it may simply mean that we need to find a better description of the process in question .",
    "the possibility of fast instabilities in perturbation theory was considered by weinberg @xcite ( see also chaicherdsakul @xcite ) , who gave a criterion according to which it is possible to decide whether such instabilities are forbidden .",
    "even where this is the case , it does not necessarily follow that perturbation theory is convergent because weinberg s theorem does not exclude the possibility of much slower divergences : for any fluctuation which is outside the horizon , these divergences scale with the number of e - folds of expansion since the time of horizon exit .    whether divergences are fast or slow , however , the interpretation is the same .",
    "when we expand an expectation value of some operators as a series in a loop - counting parameter or the slow - roll parameters , we are developing a series expansion based on the cut - off associated with the theory .",
    "the role of the cut - off is played by the time at which we wish to evaluate the expectation value  which is usually chosen to be at the end of inflation , or some similar time where we wish to use the expectation value as an initial condition for classical cosmological perturbation theory in the later universe .",
    "the behaviour of any expectation value as a function of this cut - off is merely its time dependence .",
    "the problem arises because truncating the series at any finite order gives the appearance of divergences .",
    "if we compute an answer which is superficially divergent in this way , then we must find some other method to compute the time dependence of the expectation value before growing secular terms take perturbation theory out of our control .",
    "this point of view leads to a technique of computation in which we can separate calculations into a quantum initial condition @xcite , for which we need all the machinery of the so - called in  in ( or _ schwinger  keldysh _ ) formalism , and a subsequent classical evolution for which to a good approximation we need only the classical , homogeneous evolution equations .",
    "the details of this approach have been developed by many authors @xcite .",
    "there is a possible difficulty if we allow the inflating volume to become too large , because we may then encounter a source of _ quantum _ divergences which could invalidate the use of classical evolution equations even after horizon exit @xcite , but provided we work within some patch of spacetime not much larger than the size of the present horizon such effects are likely to be negligible .",
    "most recent work on studying non - gaussianities from inflation has centred on the evolution subsequent to horizon exit @xcite , whereas the quantum initial condition has received comparatively less attention @xcite .",
    "there is a good reason for this imbalance : although there are known to be controlled examples where significant non - linearity can be generated outside the horizon @xcite , it is very hard ( with canonical kinetic terms ) to construct a controlled calculation in which a significant effect arises from the initial condition .",
    "indeed , the most useful tool for extracting predictions from the underlying quantum field theory  that is , the slow - roll expansion  generally has the effect of forcing correlations to be very small .",
    "a second interpretation of the analysis given in this paper is an example in which the initial condition is modified , by including a coupling to high - energy virtual quanta which belong to the electromagnetic field .",
    "as can be expected , it will not be possible to control the calculation in the regime where this modification dominates the initial condition . however , we will be able to obtain a bound on the characteristics of the interaction among scalar and electromagnetic quanta which guarantees that the calculation is not taken beyond our control .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use units in which @xmath7 and the reduced planck mass is set equal to unity , giving @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the background space time is de sitter space with flat spatial slices and metric @xmath10 in the @xmath11 sign convention .",
    "some formulae are more conveniently written in terms of conformal time , defined locally by the rule @xmath12 and given explicitly by the quadrature @xmath13 .",
    "spacetime indices are labelled with latin indices @xmath14 ; purely spatial indices are labelled with indices @xmath15 ; and indices in the space of scalar fields are given greek labels @xmath16 .",
    "purely spatial vectors such as @xmath17 or @xmath18 are written in bold face and an infix dot denotes index contraction with the flat background spatial metric , so that @xmath19 , where the summation symbol will usually be omitted . note that both indices are lowered .",
    "this convention is used to interpret exponentiation of any square spatial matrix @xmath20 , giving the rule @xmath21 .",
    "repeated _ spacetime _ indices in complementary raised and lowered positions are summed using the full spacetime metric @xmath22 according to the einstein convention , as usual ; this convention also applies to raised and lowered spatial indices with the substitution of the full spatial metric in contractions .",
    "the model used as an example in this paper is einstein gravity coupled to some collection of light scalar fields @xmath23 and a single @xmath24 gauge field @xmath25 . the @xmath24 gauge field is taken to have a kinetic term of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the gauge - invariant field strength .",
    "the coupling , @xmath28 , is determined by the vacuum expectation values of some or all of the light scalars .",
    "this model is studied in  [ sec : couplings ] , where the interactions among the scalar , tensor and gauge field perturbations are derived . in  [ sec : magnetogenesis ] the magnetogenesis mechanism @xcite is briefly reviewed , following an analysis by bamba & sasaki . in   [ sec : loop - spectrum][sec : loop - bispectrum ] i compute the leading loop correction for the spectrum and bispectrum which comes from scalar fluctuations mixing with virtual quanta of the gauge field . the paper concludes with a discussion in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "an auxiliary calculation of a simple pure scalar loop correction is given in [ appendix : loop ] to aid comparison of the methods used in the present paper with those of other authors .",
    "our starting point is einstein gravity coupled to a collection of scalar fields @xmath23 , some of which are responsible for inflation , with the addition of a @xmath24 gauge field @xmath25 .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , the normalization of the gauge field is taken to be controlled by some non - canonical coupling @xmath28 which is determined by the vacuum expectation values of some subset of the scalar fields .",
    "the action is @xmath29 where the @xmath24 field strength is defined by @xmath27 and @xmath30 is the spacetime ricci scalar .",
    "the potential @xmath31 is any reasonably smooth function which will generically depend on all the @xmath32 and is arbitrary except that in order for the analysis which follows to apply it must support an epoch of inflation , at least for some range of values of the scalar fields .",
    "the background spacetime is taken to be homogeneous and isotropic , so the gauge field has no expectation value , up to configurations which are pure gauge .",
    "one can therefore assume that @xmath25 is a perturbation , which will generically couple to the scalar and gravitational degrees of freedom in eq .  .",
    "to study this system of coupled perturbations it is especially convenient to write the spacetime metric ( including the effect of gravitational fluctuations ) in the so - called arnowitt  deser ",
    "misner ( adm ) form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( the `` lapse function '' ) and @xmath35 ( the `` shift vector '' ) are not dynamical degrees of freedom , but instead are determined by constraint equations .",
    "the spatial metric @xmath36 contains propagating tensor modes , and depending on the gauge it may also contain propagating scalar modes . after gauge - fixing @xmath36 , and solving the constraints , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be written in terms of the propagating degrees of freedom in @xmath36 and the @xmath23 .",
    "this is a great simplification in concrete calculations .",
    "consider first the gauge sector .",
    "the adm decomposition is based on a so - called `` 3 + 1 '' split of spacetime into three spatial dimensions and one timelike dimension .",
    "many formulae are simplified by making an analogous decomposition of the vector potential , writing @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the timelike component , and @xmath39 is a spatial 3-vector .",
    "it will transpire that @xmath38 is not a dynamical field , but is removed by a constraint associated with the gauge invariance of @xmath25 . once @xmath38 has been removed a further gauge fixing condition",
    "must be applied to @xmath39 , which leaves the expected two physical polarizations of a massless gauge boson .    when expressed in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",
    "the part of the action involving the gauge field can be written @xmath40 where we have defined a useful quantity @xmath41 by the rule @xmath42 ( denoting a time derivative with respect to @xmath43 by an overdot ) and @xmath44 is the _ spatially _ gauge - invariant 3-vector field strength , @xmath45 .",
    "the original gauge invariance associated with @xmath25 corresponding to @xmath24 gauge transformations was @xmath46 for some arbitrary spacetime - dependent function @xmath47 .",
    "under such a transformation , @xmath38 and @xmath39 undergo separate transformations determined by @xmath48 it follows that @xmath41 is gauge invariant , and therefore so is any action built out of @xmath44 and @xmath41 alone .",
    "the adm action for @xmath38 and @xmath39 is singular , because the lagrangian is degenerate along pure gauge directions .",
    "it therefore can not be quantized as it stands , but must be put into a form suitable for quantum mechanical calculations by adding a term of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a so - called slavnov operator , @xmath51 @xmath52 is an auxiliary field , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 are a pair of anti - commuting ghost fields which nevertheless obey bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the function @xmath55 is chosen to remove the degeneracy along gauge directions , but is otherwise essentially arbitrary provided that it is not invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "it is usually described as a gauge - fixing function . for the purposes of the present paper",
    "the most appropriate choice is an analogue of the lorentz ",

    "it is immaterial whether we choose @xmath55 or @xmath58 , and since there are no serious consequences associated with losing manifest spatial covariance we will stick with @xmath55 .",

    "the physical degrees of freedom in the action   are a collection of propagating modes associated with the scalars , @xmath23 , together with modes arising from the components of @xmath36 .",

    "this boundary condition plays an important role in the calculation .",
    "it corresponds to the stipulation that we begin with conventional minkowski space quantum field theory in the ultra - violet , and then attempt to determine what this implies for fluctuations deep in the infra - red .",
    "although it is possible to make more general choices of field theory in the ultra - violet , the assumption of flat space field theory is minimal and any admixture of different ultra - violet physics is usually subdominant to the minkowski result .",
    "when we come to define what we mean by loop integrals in de sitter space , which are also part of the specification of the ultra - violet behaviour of the theory , it will be necessary to take care that our definition does not destroy the property that we begin with flat space field theory at very high energies .",

    "instead , one can obtain a solution of wentzel  kramers  brillouin ( wkb ) type which is valid inside the horizon , and can be matched onto a long wavelength solution which is valid outside the horizon .",
    "this is equivalent to using the flat space boundary condition deep inside the horizon to determine the size of fluctuations at horizon exit , and then using this as an initial condition for a classical superhorizon calculation .",

    "it is sometimes said that a canonically normalized vector field does not receive a perturbation from inflation , based on the observation that positive and negative frequencies of the gauge field are not mixed as the universe expands @xcite .",
    "it follows that if asymptotic _ in _ and _ out _ vacua can be defined there is no particle creation in the transition between the _ in_- and _ out_-vacuum . in the computation of inflationary observables",
    ", however , there is usually no natural _ out _ region where a notion of particles make sense , nor any need to invoke such a region .",
    "instead , we are interested primarily in whether expectation values of operators behave coherently over many e - folds of expansion , and in this sense a canonically normalized gauge field receives a fluctuation in exactly the same way as any light bosonic field . as we have already observed , however , the fluctuation which is imprinted in the precisely canonical case is very blue and entirely negligible on cosmologically relevant scales .",
    "one can think of this as a consequence of the fact that canonically coupled vector fluctuations must redshift like radiation , giving an extremely strong suppression for scales which exited the horizon early and have been redshifting for longer .",
    "once modes re - enter the horizon they begin to oscillate and expectation values of their associated operators lose their coherence , which is consistent with parker s observation that there is no asymptotic particle creation in this model @xcite .",
    "the situation changes in the presence of the non - canonical coupling @xmath28 . in this case",
    "eq .   suggests that if @xmath119 the power in fluctuations of the gauge field has been amplified in comparison with a vanilla model where @xmath120 for all time .",
    "however , this is misleading .",
    "since the energy ",
    "momentum tensor associated with the gauge field is proportional to @xmath121 , when we compute the energy density stored in @xmath39 at horizon exit we obtain an answer which is independent of @xmath122 .",
    "it follows that there is a subtle distinction between this method of generating perturbations and the familiar case of scalar perturbations . in the simplest model of scalar perturbations , we generate fluctuations of the correct magnitude at horizon exit which are then conserved until horizon re - entry . in the case of @xmath39",
    "we do not make the physical fluctuations _ at horizon exit _ any larger whether or not we include a coupling @xmath121 .",
    "it is evolution of @xmath121 _ after _ horizon crossing which amplifies fluctuations in the gauge field and prevents them redshifting to zero ; in this respect , the mechanism is similar to the curvaton example for purely scalar perturbations .",
    "we should therefore expect physical quantities to involve the ratio , @xmath123 , of @xmath121 at different times @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which can be made large only if @xmath121 evolves sufficiently strongly that there is a large hierarchy between its values at these times .",
    "in the limit of an observation made instantaneously at a moment in time , we can conclude that the physical effect must be proportional to @xmath126 , or a higher derivative , where @xmath127 denotes differentiation with respect to the conformal time .",
    "the power spectrum and bispectrum measured at horizon exit are examples of observations made instantaneously , and we shall see in   [ sec : loop - spectrum][sec : loop - bispectrum ] below that they come proportional to powers of @xmath126 .",
    "an alternative means of breaking conformal invariance was considered in ref .",

    "the time integral has dimension @xmath216 , so it can only make this divergence worse at high energy , and improve convergence at low energy . to make sense of such an integral it",

    "once this is done , the ultra - violet sensitivity of the original integral implies that we can expect the loop to be dominated by contributions near some uv scale . in what follows , we use this to ignore effects associated with the infra - red cutoff .    how are we to choose a cut - off in an expanding , inflationary spacetime ?",
    "in flat space quantum field theory we are familiar with the use of a variety of regulators .",
    "the method of the renormalization group tells us that these are all equivalent in the continuum limit , after the introduction of counter - terms and a renormalization prescription .",
    "the simplest choice is a hard cutoff , @xmath217 , on the invariant momenta associated with particles which circulate within the loops . to apply this cutoff in practice one must wick rotate loop integrals to euclidean spacetime where @xmath217 becomes a @xmath218-invariant cut - off on the euclidean momentum .",
    "when we revert to lorentzian signature , this procedure gives a @xmath219-invariant result and therefore preserves lorentz invariance . as a result , the hard momentum cutoff in minkowski space provides a popular means of estimating the magnitude of loops in an effective theory . the problem at hand is to find a way to perform similar estimates in de sitter space .",
    "in any curved spacetime we do not have global lorentz invariance , although according to the equivalence principle we must recover approximate local @xmath219 invariance in a small neighbourhood of any point .",
    "on the basis of the discussion in  [ sec : magnetogenesis ] it follows that this restoration of lorentz invariance in the ultra - violet corresponds to choosing conventional flat space quantum field theory deep inside the horizon .",
    "whatever regulator we pick , it is necessary to be sure that it does not conflict with local lorentz invariance in the ultra - violet , or we shall obtain nonsensical results .",
    "recently , van der meulen and smit @xcite have pointed out that that a momentum cut - off at some characteristic scale @xmath217 should be taken to apply to _ proper _ momenta , rather than comoving momenta , since only the former have physical significance .",
    "however , such a cut - off violates local lorentz invariance for any finite value of the cut - off .",
    "this is because the cut - off grows between adjacent spatial slices which are taken at later and later times .",
    "if we pick some particular point in spacetime and ask whether lorentz invariance is restored in a local neighbourhood of that point we find that no matter how small a patch of spacetime we choose , it necessarily intersects a sheaf of spatial slices .",
    "the growth in the cut - off transverse to the sheaf picks out a preferred direction , and the properties of the theory do not become invariant under local spacetime rotations within the patch .",
    "it follows that lorentz invariance is broken .",
    "breakdown of lorentz invariance in the ultra - violet would have dramatic consequences for the stability of the theory .",
    "as time increases , the cut - off grows .",
    "this means that between two adjacent spatial slices , one taken at a slightly later time than the other , new quanta are introduced to our universe @xcite .",
    "these new quanta destabilize the theory , because although they are at very high energies when they are added to the description , they can scatter with each other to produce other quanta which are much softer .",
    "these scattered soft quanta , whose correlations are essentially random , impinge on superhorizon correlation functions and scramble their values",
    ". thus , in the presence of the lorentz - violating cut - off , correlation functions do not retain coherent values outside the horizon but instead behave as if they are coupled to a quantum noise bath and are swamped exponentially quickly by quantum noise . in this cut - off theory",
    "there is no quantum - to - classical transition , and presumably there are no conserved quantities outside the horizon . on the other hand , if we find a way to preserve lorentz invariance then none of these undesirable features become manifest .",
    "one can think of this stabilizing property of lorentz invariance as analogous to the conservation of the velocity of the centre of energy of any isolated system .",

    "one then chooses a `` factorization scale '' which determines the energy below which partons are summed up into hadrons according to certain `` parton distribution functions . '' in doing so , it is possible to encounter large logarithmic singularities at soft or collinear momenta which enhance the phase space for interacting partons to dress themselves into jets , or which manifest as initial state radiation .",
    "one can find analogues for all these effects in cosmology : high energy corresponds to early times during inflation , where the slow - roll approximation applies and perturbation theory in slow - roll quantities makes sense ; the time of horizon crossing plays the role of the factorization scale ; the coefficients of the @xmath159 expansion correspond to the parton distribution functions ; and logarithms such as @xmath241 play the role of the singularities at soft or collinear momenta .",

    "in this paper i have computed the corrections to the spectrum and bispectrum of a set of light scalar fields which arise from coupling to an electromagnetic field during inflation . the calculation of inflationary observables is conventionally split into a quantum - mechanical initial condition , which specifies the momentum - dependence of expectation values at the time of horizon crossing , and a subsequent classical evolution .",
    "the interaction studied in this paper constitutes a correction to the initial condition , and can be thought of as arising from interactions with virtual quanta of the electromagnetic field . in a scenario where the gauge coupling is rolling rapidly during inflation , these virtual electromagnetic quanta experience strong amplification",
    "as they are drawn across the horizon and `` freeze in '' to the correlations among the scalar modes at that time .",
    "to which scenarios would this correction apply ?",
    "the most direct application is to theories of so - called magnetogenesis , where one aims to produce a late - time magnetic field by breaking the conformal invariance of the @xmath24 gauge field . in this scenario",
    "the scalar fields which determine the expectation value @xmath28 must be rolling on cosmological timescales , meaning that these scalars will typically also contribute to the curvature perturbation , @xmath158 .",
    "it is @xmath158 which is visible as the adiabatic temperature perturbation in the cosmic microwave background .",

    "[ sec : loop - bispectrum ] it is probably most conservative to adopt the limit @xmath319 , because the evidence that current observation matches perturbative calculations of the bispectrum is rather less strong than for the spectrum .",
    "there is another mechanism by which synthesis of an electric or magnetic field could destabilize conventional perturbation theory .",
    "if the energy density in electromagnetic radiation begins to compete with the potential energy associated with the scalar fields , then this would deform the comoving hypersurface on which inflation ends .",
    "this deformation would imply that @xmath158 was not conserved , but rather would acquire a contribution from this final hypersurface @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the energy density in the electromagnetic field remains small , then we can be confident that there is no back - reaction on the metric . in this case",
    ", it follows that the hypersurface on which inflation ends suffers a negligible deformation and @xmath158 is given by the usual procedure , because the electromagnetic energy density never contributes to the expansion rate or the integrated number of e - foldings , @xmath34 .",
    "when does energy in the electromagnetic field remain small ?",
    "this question was addressed by bamba @xcite and martin & yokoyama @xcite , who gave a detailed discussion of the back - reaction problem .",
    "they concluded that when a magnetic field is synthesized there is never a problem with back reaction , whereas if the outcome is an electric field then the scenario is only free of instabilities associated with back reaction if the scale of inflation is taken to be very low .",
    "one way to understand this phenomenon is to note that the magnetic energy density @xmath322 is proportional to spatial gradients , whereas the electric energy density @xmath323 involves a time derivative .",
    "we must therefore include @xmath324 at leading order in a gradient expansion of the scalar klein ",

    "this `` instability '' may entail nothing more dramatic than a macroscopic flow of charge which shorts out the electric field @xcite , but our ability to calculate is impaired and it is difficult to draw conclusions with any confidence . therefore ,",
    "unless the scale of inflation is taken to be very low , it seems that one should restrict attention to scenarios where @xmath28 grows during inflation .",
    "couplings between scalars and @xmath24 gauge fields are invoked in certain theories of dark energy , such as the so - called `` chameleon '' @xcite model .",
    "such couplings were proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , following earlier work @xcite , and studied using astrophysical means in refs .",
    "( for laboratory limits , see refs .  @xcite . )",
    "however , the chameleon is essentially inert during inflation : it rolls rapidly to its minimum , and is fixed there for the duration of inflation @xcite .",
    "since it is not in motion while observable scales are leaving the horizon , the parameter @xmath167 which controls the magnitude of the correction tends to zero .",
    "moreover , because the energy density carried by the chameleon is cosmologically negligible , its expectation values do not contribute to those of the curvature perturbation .",
    "therefore , although perturbation theory may fail for expectation values of the chameleon field if the associated mass scale is too small , this has no observational consequences .",
    "we conclude that no limit on the chameleon coupling @xmath249 analogous to those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite can be extracted from the present analysis .",
    "although fast instabilities were encountered at intermediate points in the calculation , the final expectation values were found to be free of fast divergences .",
    "their time dependence was instead described by powers of @xmath233 , which measures by how many e - folds the fluctuation in question has passed outside the horizon .",
    "one can understand this as a consequence of a theorem due to weinberg , which guarantees that interactions involving gauge fields are well behaved in this sense @xcite .",
    "in the present case , although the electromagnetic part of the interaction would be `` dangerous '' ( in weinberg s sense ) as part of a scalar interaction because it involves time derivatives , it does not produce fast divergences .",
    "indeed , the only effect of differentiation with respect to time when applied to a mode of the gauge field is to introduce factors of the slowly varying parameter @xmath167 .",
    "such factors merely set the scale of the interaction , rather than changing the character of the time dependence , as would be the case for a scalar mode .",

    "in this appendix , i compute the scalar loop correction coming from a simple @xmath220 vertex .",
