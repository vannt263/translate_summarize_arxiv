    "the elastic constants , phonon frequencies , and equation of state ( eos ) are fundamental properties of matter .",
    "the values of these parameters under compression find application in geophysics  @xcite and in the prediction and interpretation of processes of dynamic compression .",
    "@xcite for many materials , especially elemental metals , the principal hugoniot curves , the set of states accessible via a single shock from ambient conditions , have been measured .",
    "@xcite since the pressure , density , and internal energy are known along the hugoniot from the jump conditions,@xcite this data is an important baseline for high pressure equations of state .",
    "the off - hugoniot eos is needed for the prediction of processes involving more complicated loading paths , such as multiple shocks or shock and release .",
    "@xcite extrapolation from the hugoniot has also been used to establish pressure standards for static high pressure experiments , whose room temperature isotherms are regarded as known .",
    "@xcite au has been used as a standard in this way , and has been used to calibrate the ruby @xmath2 line as a secondary standard.@xcite recent studies have called into question the accuracy of the gold pressure standard .",
    "et al._@xcite compressed au and pt in the same cell and found two au standards@xcite to give pressures lower than pt by 20 and 15 gpa , respectively , at 150 gpa .",
    "shim et al.,@xcite on the other hand , propose a new eos for au that gives pressures still lower than either of these earlier standards .",
    "to relate the hugoniot to the room temperature isotherm requires information on the grneisen parameter @xmath3 and the specific heat @xmath4.@xcite these are dominated by lattice vibrations in the regimes under consideration here . with increasing compression , the separation between the hugoniot pressure and the room temperature pressure increases , resulting in greater dependence of the inferred room temperature isotherm on @xmath5 .",
    "because @xmath5 is not easily measured at high pressure , this introduces a non - negligible source of uncertainty in the pressure standards . in most cases , a model assumption of the form @xmath6 has been used .",
    "the specific value @xmath7 has been used often in shock work.@xcite however , a power law dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath8 is qualitatively incorrect at high compression , and extrapolation on this basis is inherently limited .    in principle , the various components of the eos  the static lattice energy , the vibrational free energy , and the electronic excitation free energy  can be evaluated from electronic structure theory .",
    "practical calculations based on approximate density functional theories typically have errors of several percent in the density at zero pressure , and 10 % or more in the bulk modulus .",
    "@xcite these are unacceptably large errors for the purpose of high accuracy equations of state .",
    "these properties can be measured accurately , and are mainly determined by the cold energy curve , which is the largest contribution to the eos in the regime considered here . on the other hand , we find that _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations are capable of obtaining phonon frequencies of sufficient accuracy to strongly constrain the volume dependence of the grneisen parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore propose that the most accurate eos in the solid is obtained by combining an empirical cold energy with _ ab initio _",
    "lattice vibration and electronic excitation free energies .",
    "this is analogous to procedures that have been used to reduce shock hugoniot data and derive room temperature standards , but the present analysis gives a strong physical foundation for the volume dependence of @xmath5 , allowing confidence in the results at higher compression .",
    "we are not aware of any evidence of solid - solid phase transitions in au , and we consider only the fcc solid .",
    "recent calculations@xcite indicate a transition to the hcp structure for @xmath9 , and we do not attempt to extend our solid eos beyond this density .    this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "first we discuss lattice dynamics and its connection to the eos .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the classical limit for defining the ion motion contribution to @xmath5 .",
    "we describe our procedures for calculating phonon frequencies and interpolating to the whole brillouin zone .",
    "next we present our results for elastic and phonon properties of au , and our analysis to obtain @xmath10 .",
    "we then present the complete eos for solid au by giving a set of closed form expressions for the helmholtz free energy with parameters .",
    "the resulting room temperature isotherm is compared with various proposed standards .",
    "next we discuss shock melting and its effect on the hugoniot within an approximate model , and finally give our conclusions .",
    "we write the helmholtz free energy as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the static lattice energy , @xmath13 is the ion motion free energy , and @xmath14 is the electronic excitation free energy . in our applications , @xmath12 gives the largest contribution to the pressure . the ion motion free energy gives the dominant temperature dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "the electronic excitation term @xmath14 is generally a small correction to the solid eos , becoming important for the liquid hugoniot at several hundred gpa .",
    "it is , therefore , imperative to have an accurate @xmath13 for calculating the temperature dependence of @xmath16 .",
    "the quasi - harmonic approximation has been found to have small errors in many cases.@xcite we have carried out monte carlo simulations using an embedded atom model@xcite of cu to investigate the importance of anharmonic corrections to the ion free energy . here",
    "we define the anharmonic free energy to be the difference between the true ion free energy and the quasi - harmonic approximation , noting that the term has been used differently@xcite by other authors.@xcite we intend to publish details of our cu simulations elsewhere . in summary",
    ", we find that up to 300 gpa on the melting curve , @xmath17 gpa , and is never more than 3% of the _ thermal _ pressure @xmath18 , a very small correction to the total pressure .",
    "given the similarity of the bonding in cu and au , we expect these results to be relevant for au also .",

    ", the ion pressure is linear in @xmath33 with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , and the specific heat is constant , @xmath36 .",
    "the role of quantum ion motion in the eos is illustrated in figure [ qcl_plot ] , which shows the pressure along an isochore @xmath37 .",

    "it is clear that the classical limit dominates even at room temperature .",
    "the hugoniot is well into the classical regime . at higher densities ,",
    "the hugoniot is still further above the quantum regime . the largest quantum effect on the pressure is at @xmath38 , where the zero - point vibrations contribute a pressure of 0.8 gpa at this density .",
    "the classical limit is clearly dominant for interpolating between the hugoniot and room temperature .     along an isochore @xmath37 .",

    "( [ wdw0 ] ) and the standard definition of @xmath29 in terms of acoustic velocities , we refer to the debye free energy together with eq .",
    "( [ wdw0 ] ) as the high - temperature debye model .",
    "the high - temperature debye model gives the same results as the full quasi - harmonic free energy in the classical regime , and in addition obeys the nernst theorem at low @xmath33 .",
    "we have checked that at low @xmath33 , the error in the pressure compared to the full quasi - harmonic approximation is entirely negligible .",
    "thus , we can simplify the specification of the lattice vibration free energy from giving @xmath23 at all @xmath8 to giving the single moment @xmath42 at all @xmath8 .",
    "this is advantageous for numerical applications .",
    "it also allows us to express our full eos in a few compact formulae so that it is generally accessible .",
    "these formulae are given below .",
    "calculating the moments @xmath28 requires the phonon frequencies for all @xmath43 in the brillouin zone .",
    "direct _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on a dense mesh in @xmath43 would be quite expensive . as a result of another study@xcite we found that the low order moments can often be accurately obtained from short - ranged force constant models .",
    "in particular , for au , the moment @xmath42 is converged to less than 1 % with a 2nd neighbor ( 2nn ) model .",
    "therefore , our method is to calculate four zone boundary phonon frequencies corresponding to the transverse and longitudinal modes at the @xmath44 and @xmath45 points .",
    "these are calculated with standard frozen - phonon methods .",
    "in addition the three elastic moduli are calculated using the method described by sderlind et al.@xcite we fit these results to a 2nn force constant model , which then allows the evaluation of @xmath21 for arbitrary @xmath43 for integration over the brillouin zone .",
    "the electronic structure calculations used the full - potential lapw code wien97.@xcite we used the lda rather than the gga , based on boettger s finding@xcite that the lda gives a better static lattice energy than the gga for au .",

    ", brillouin zone integrals used special points corresponding to @xmath49 points in the full zone , with gaussian smearing of the energies by 20 mry .",
    "the zone boundary phonons were found to be comparatively insensitive to the @xmath43-point mesh , and smaller meshes of @xmath50 points were used .",
    "the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 shells were treated as valence states , and local orbital extensions@xcite were used in the @xmath54 and @xmath55 channels .",
    "we used a generalized born - von krmn force model for our lattice - dynamical calculations , from which we were able to compute the phonon dispersions in the entire brillouin zone . since gold has a very simple phonon dispersion , we employed only a model with first ( 1nn ) and second ( 2nn ) nearest - neighbor interatomic shells of atoms . in an fcc lattice the 1nn and 2nn forces are determined by three and two independent parameters , respectively ( for more details see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "these five force constants were extracted by fitting simultaneously the phonon frequencies of gold at the @xmath44 and @xmath45 points of the brillouin zone and the elastic constants c@xmath56 , c@xmath57 , and c@xmath58 near the zone center ( @xmath59 point ) .",
    "thus we fit a total of seven independent data points .",
    "we gave equal weight to the zone boundary phonons and elastic constants in our @xmath60-fit of the phonon dispersions .",
    "although the 2nn born - von krmn force model is too simple to reproduce all phonon frequencies within less than approximately 10% , see figure [ dispcurve ] , it is sufficiently accurate to compute integrated quantities such as the phonon moments within less than approximately 3% .",
    "more accurate phonon dispersions can be obtained if needed , by computing _ ab initio _ frequencies at half and quarter distances in the brillouin zone and fitting those to a 3nn or higher - order born - von krmn force model , or to phonon models with interatomic pseudo - potentials .",

    "electronic excitations have a small effect .",
    "this , together with the dominance of the classical limit in the vibrational free energy , means that the widely used mie - grneisen approximation , that @xmath186 is independent of @xmath33 , is accurate . at the highest compressions",
    "the physics affecting the hugoniot becomes more complicated .",
    "melting is predicted to begin at 280 gpa and @xmath187 .",
    "complete melting is estimated to lead to a 30 gpa increase in the hugoniot pressure over the solid . at these densities and higher",
    ", the hugoniot temperature is rising rapidly and electronic excitations are playing an increasing role .",
    "the highest hugoniot data are at 580 gpa , where the temperature is calculated to be above @xmath188 k. the mie - grneisen approximation is not expected to be valid for interpolating between the hugoniot and room temperature at this high compression , because of the strong effects of melting and electronic excitations .",
    "these effects need to be taken explicitly into account , as has been done here .",
    "regarding eos standards , our analysis gives a room temperature @xmath180 curve that agrees well with that of heinz and jeanloz@xcite to 200 gpa .",
    "our eos gives @xmath189 generally somewhat larger than theirs , and we believe that in this regard our eos is preferred .",
    "the eos of jamieson _ et al._@xcite is based on reduction of shock data , and was originally given to 80 gpa .",
    "it gives somewhat lower pressures than ours , which is due to their use of a grneisen parameter that is too large at all volumes .",
    "extrapolation of their room temperature isotherm to higher pressures@xcite is not recommended .",
    "et al._@xcite adopted the room temperature isotherm of heinz and jeanloz@xcite , while giving a different thermal pressure .",
    "their eos gives @xmath190 which is substantially too low under compression , and is not recommended for high temperatures .",
    "simultaneous compression of au and pt showed@xcite that the pt standard of holmes _ et al._@xcite gave a pressure higher by 15 and 20 gpa than the au standards of heinz and jeanloz@xcite and jamieson,@xcite respectively , at a pressure of 150 gpa . while the extrapolated jamieson isotherm is expected to be somewhat low , our analysis agrees with the room temperature isotherm of heinz and jeanloz , suggesting that the discrepancy between the au and pt pressures is due to errors in the pt standard .",
