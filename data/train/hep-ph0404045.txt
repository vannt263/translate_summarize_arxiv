    "recent studies indicate that the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be able to discover a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson with mass between 100 and 200 gev with an integrated luminosity of only 10 to 30 fb@xmath4 if weak boson fusion ( wbf ) followed by @xmath5 and @xmath2 channels are taken into account @xcite .",
    "this intermediate mass range is currently favored in light of a lower bound of 114.1 gev from direct searches at lep2 and an upper bound of 196 gev from a sm analysis of electroweak precision data ( at 95% cl ) @xcite . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , sec .",
    "a.1 , the precise knowledge of the significance of any observed higgs signal will require an accurate determination of the sm backgrounds .",
    "the @xmath6 decay channel ( @xmath7 ) in wbf as well as gluon fusion ( gf ) @xcite is particularly challenging , because missing momentum prevents the observation of a narrow mass peak that would allow an interpolation of the backgrounds from side bands .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how the extrapolation approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be applied to determine the top quark background to the @xmath2 di - lepton decay mode at the lhc with an accuracy that is in line with experimentalists expectations . in the remainder of this section",
    "we briefly describe our conventions and the specifics of our calculations .",
    "we can then quantify the theoretical uncertainty of a conventional , leading order ( lo ) determination of the background rates under consideration . in sections",
    "[ wbf - section ] and [ gf - section ] , we show for wbf and gf , respectively , how experimental data allows to determine these backgrounds with significantly reduced theoretical uncertainty . in section [ disc - section ] , we consider caveats and improvements and conclude with a summary in section [ concl - section ] .    to be specific",
    ", we consider the dominant @xmath3 + 1 jet background to the @xmath8 search in wbf and apply the selection cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see sec .  [ wbf - section ] ) , which are very similar to the cuts adopted by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "we further consider the large @xmath3 background to the inclusive @xmath2 search , i.e.  the same higgs decay mode in gf . in this case",
    ", we calculate results for atlas selection cuts as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , sec .  19.2.6 , as well as cms selection cuts @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ gf - section ] ) .    to investigate the scale uncertainty of these backgrounds and",
    "how it can be reduced we apply the following definitions for the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath9 and @xmath10 . a factor @xmath11",
    "is then used to vary the scales around the central values .",
    "the suggestive scale choice for top production is the top mass @xmath12 gev : @xmath13 results for this scale choice are shown as solid curves in the figures . for wbf , due to forward tagging selection cuts",
    ", the dominant background arises from @xmath3 production with one additional hard jet . to avoid double counting in this case ,",
    "we alternatively calculate with scales based on the minimal transverse mass : @xmath14 results for this second definition are shown as dashed curves in the figures . in principle , the renormalization and factorization scales are independent .",
    "we find , however , that the strongest scale variation occurs if both scales are varied in the same direction and thus only introduce a single parameter @xmath11 .",
    "scale - dependent quantities are customarily condensed into the form @xmath15 based on a particular low and high scale choice .",
    "we use the convention @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a cross section or cross section ratio .",
    "all cross sections are calculated using the parton - level monte carlo programs of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which include finite width effects and the complete lo matrix elements for @xmath18 ( + jets ) final states .",
    "we calculate with complete matrix elements unless otherwise noted and use the complex mass scheme ( cms ) @xcite to guarantee gauge invariance .",
    "sm parameters and other calculational details are as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that we use the updated parton distribution function ( pdf ) set cteq6l1 .",
    "the calculations take into account finite resolution and @xmath19 decay effects and a suboptimal @xmath19 tagging efficiency @xmath20 based on expectations for the atlas and cms detectors .",
    "[ wbf - scalevariation-40percent - btagging](a ) , [ wbf - scalevariation-60percent - btagging](a ) , [ gf - scalevariation - atlas - cuts](a ) and [ gf - scalevariation - cms - cuts](a ) show the large scale variation that is expected for the lo background cross sections in both search channels .",
    "for the wbf search channel , the scale scheme ( [ topscheme ] ) yields a background cross section of @xmath21 fb , whereas the scheme ( [ transscheme ] ) yields @xmath22 fb .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is 4045% .",
    "since the second cross section is not consistent with the first within 1@xmath23 , it seems more appropriate to apply the prescription ( [ theoryerrorestimate ] ) to the envelope of both curves .",
    "all subsequent wbf results will be given using this procedure .",
    "then , one obtains @xmath24 fb , with an even larger uncertainty of 60% .",
    "these results assume a @xmath19 tagging efficiency of 40% . with a more optimistic assumption of 60%",
    "one obtains a 27% smaller background with similar uncertainty : @xmath25 fb . for the top background in the inclusive @xmath2 search a somewhat smaller theoretical uncertainty",
    "is obtained , i.e.  3.4 fb ( 4.4 fb ) with an uncertainty of 25% ( 25% ) for atlas ( cms ) selection cuts ( with @xmath26 ) . for both channels",
    "it is obvious that the accuracy of theoretical background calculations at lo is insufficient to determine the total background with an accuracy of order 10% , as required by experimental physicists @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation approach allows a more accurate determination of a background cross section @xmath27 if a reference selection with a corresponding well - defined , measurable event rate @xmath28 can be found , so that the theoretical uncertainty of the ratio @xmath29 is small and a sufficient number of events are observed during the run that @xmath30 can be measured with low experimental uncertainty . and other systematic experimental uncertainties . ]",
    "the background cross section can then be approximated through @xmath31 qualitatively , the smaller the difference between the cuts for background and reference selection , the lower the uncertainty of @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , the selection cuts have to be modified sufficiently , so that @xmath30 can be measured with good accuracy .",
    "thus , to derive suitable reference selections from the corresponding background selections in the case at hand , we propose the following strategy : the wbf and inclusive @xmath2 search channel top backgrounds are effectively suppressed through a central jet veto . discarding this veto leads to a sizable increase of the cross sections . secondly , to identify the top backgrounds in both cases , we require that only events be considered that contain at least one identified @xmath19 jet . in our calculations",
    "we assume that each @xmath19 ( or @xmath32 ) quark can be identified independently with probability @xmath20 if it is in the phase space region with @xmath19 tagging detector capability , which we assume to be @xmath33 the probability @xmath34 for a parton - level event to fulfill the @xmath19 tagging criterion is then given by [ atleastonebquarktaggedprobability ] p_btag =    1-(1-_b)^2 & , + _ b & , + 0 & ,    and the reference cross section is calculated by integrating @xmath35 . since events that are identified as top production via @xmath19 tagging can be eliminated from the signal sample , we calculate all background cross sections by integrating @xmath36 .",
    "if , after demanding a tagged @xmath19 jet and discarding the central jet veto , the resulting reference rate is still too small , we also discard the lepton pair cuts .    in the search for a light higgs boson in wbf",
    "the selection is given by the forward tagging cuts @xmath37 and the lepton pair cuts @xmath38 with @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] with transverse energies @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we fix @xmath42 gev , which defines the transverse mass window cut .",
    "the jet veto is applied by discarding all events where an additional jet is located between the tagging jets , @xmath43 the reference selection obtained by eliminating the veto ( [ wbf - jet - veto ] ) and requiring at least one tagged @xmath19 jet yields a cross section of 13 fb , which , with 30 fb@xmath4 , would result in a statistical uncertainty for the measured rate of about 5% ( using poisson statistics ) .",
    "we therefore also discard the lepton pair cuts ( [ wbf - lepton - pair - cuts ] ) .",
    "the resulting reference cross section of @xmath44 fb gives rise to a statistical error of slightly less than 2% with 30 fb@xmath4 of data for @xmath45 ( and also with @xmath46 fb for @xmath47 ) .",
    "note that the scale uncertainty of these reference cross sections is very similar to that of the background cross sections .",
    "however , the scale variation of the corresponding ratios @xmath29 is significantly reduced as shown in figs .",
    "[ wbf - scalevariation-40percent - btagging](b ) and [ wbf - scalevariation-60percent - btagging](b ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath48 for @xmath47 and @xmath49 for @xmath45 , or a relative error of 5% .",
    "note that the applicable ratio depends strongly on the achieved @xmath19 tagging efficiency .- tagged event rejection for @xmath27 also strongly affect the ratio .",
    "if , for example , only events with @xmath19-tagged forward tagging jets are discarded , background and ratio increase by 30% .",
    "the sensitivity to variations in the gluon pdf is smaller : calculating with cteq4l instead of cteq6l1 reduces the ratio by 7% . ]",
    "background cross section ( a ) and ratio with reference cross section ( b ) to @xmath8 search in weak boson fusion at the lhc for different scale definitions ( see main text ) and @xmath47 . ]     background cross section ( a ) and ratio with reference cross section ( b ) to @xmath8 search in weak boson fusion at the lhc for different scale definitions ( see main text ) and @xmath47 . ]    , but for @xmath45 . ]    , but for @xmath45 . ]    as seen in table [ wbf - measurement - uncertainty ] , an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath4 would allow a measurement of the wbf reference cross section with a statistical error of 2% or less .",
    "combining the uncertainty of both extrapolation factors in quadrature yields a wbf background estimate with an accuracy of about 5% .",
    ".expected number of events @xmath50 and statistical experimental error for wbf reference selection for different integrated luminosities .",
    "[ wbf - measurement - uncertainty ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    in addition to the discussed theoretical improvements , systematic experimental uncertainties should also be taken into account in future studies .",
    "a lo analysis was presented that demonstrates that key top backgrounds to @xmath0 decays in weak boson fusion and gluon fusion at the cern large hadron collider can be extrapolated from experimental data with an accuracy of order 5% to 10% . a prescription to derive the required reference selections",
    "was given .",
    "if lo scale variation is accepted as proxy for the theoretical error , parton level results indicate that the @xmath1 background to the @xmath2 search in wbf can be determined with a theoretical error of about 5% , while the @xmath3 background to the @xmath2 search in gf can be determined with a theoretical error of better than 1% .",
    "uncertainties in the parton distribution functions contribute an estimated 3% to 10% to the total error . in order to accurately extrapolate the gf background , contributions beyond lo",
    "should be taken into account in future studies .",
