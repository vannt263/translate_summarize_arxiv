    ", the potential shows one global minimum with larger depth and two local minima with smaller but uneven depth .",
    "this implies that all three minima are not symmetric under the @xmath1 rotation @xmath107 .",
    "this is unlike the pure gauge case in fig .",
    "[ gauge_pot_fig ] , an indication of explicit @xmath1 symmetry breaking in presence of dynamical quarks . in this region",
    "@xmath173 the mean freepath of the color charges begin to increase as they tend to move from local minima to energetically favourable global minimum .",
    "interestingly , the explicit symmetry breaking due to the presence of the matter fields leads to a _ metastable state _ in the temperature range ( @xmath174 ) and beyond which the system crosses smoothly to the deconfined phase .",
    "so , the concept of @xmath175 is not very well defined and lattice qcd calculations estimate it through various observable   mev from the peak of susceptibilites .",
    "the wuppertal - budapest collaboration  @xcite using _ stout _ action found @xmath176 mev , @xmath177 mev and @xmath178 mev from the peak position of susceptibility , and inflection points in chiral and renormalized chiral condensates . ] and find in the range @xmath179 mev .",
    "our observation of @xmath180 mev where the instability of the metastable minima stabilizes due to the expansion of the domains as can be seen clearly from the contour plots in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ full_pot_fig ] . like gauge sector",
    "the depth of all three minima becomes almost symmetric for @xmath181mev as the domains expand with temperature .",
    "the color charges , irrespective of their nature , begin to reside at those minima in fig .",
    "[ full_pot_fig ] for @xmath3 mev .",
    "these domains are separated by non - perturbative domain walls even well above @xmath175 because the fluctuations of the background gauge field are still nonzero .",
    "moreover , the mean free path of the color charges becomes of the order of the effective size of these domains  @xcite . since the domains expand , arround",
    "@xmath182 the domain size is usually smaller that corresponds to shorter wavelength appropriate for hydrodynamics to be applicable whereas the perturbative qcd may be applicable at high @xmath112 as the domain size increases .",
    "there will also be plenty of domains at high @xmath112 due to the fluctuations of the background gauge field . in the color deconfined phase these domains as well domain walls act as scattering centers that cause high energy jet to lose energy through gluon radiations and get quenched  @xcite .    in the asymptotically high temperature ( @xmath151 ) , eq.([mpotl ] )",
    "becomes @xmath183 where @xmath156 .",
    "it represents the thermodynamic potential for a free colored quark , antiquark and gluon gas at high temperature , i.e , the color charges are completely ionized and reside at those minima in potential of fig .",
    "[ full_pot_fig ] or equivalently at those maxima in color space of figs .",
    "[ phi_3d_f ] and [ phi_eqva ] .    at low temperature ( @xmath157 ) , the potential with matter part can be written as @xmath184 this represents the thermodynamic potential for a composite color singlet object containing three quarks(antiquarks ) in a same color state with the same energy .",
    "so is for gluons as discussed earlier .",
    "one can also combine appropriate terms in ( [ eq8 ] ) to get mesons , baryons , hybrid mesons , glueballs etc .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0 color singlet restriction vis - a - vis polyakov loop dynamically confines three colored charges in a same energy state , which finally forms a color neutral object like baryon and glueball .",
    "this is because color charges get frozen in color singlet states like hadrons in the global minimum when @xmath157 .",
    "this essentially boils down to the fact that the @xmath0 color singlet restriction vis - a - vis polyakov loop dynamically provides the basis for the recombination of partons for hadronisation from quark - gluon plasma when it cools down below @xmath175 . in refs .",
    "@xcite the colorsingletness has explicitly shown to provide the natural explanation of the scaling law ( of the valence partons ) of the eliptic flow of the identified hadrons in heavy - ion collisions , a direct evidence of deconfined phase  @xcite .",
    "we show that the color singlet ensemble of a quark - gluon gas becomes equivalent to that of polyakov loop model within a stationary point approximation .",
    "the calculation is based on quantum statistical mechanics with a global @xmath0 symmetry but considering the haar measure at each spatial points to take into account the confinement effect .",
    "the normalized character in fundamental representation of @xmath0 exhibits center symmetry , @xmath1 , of @xmath0 akin to polyakov loop . in the process , we have also obtained pure gauge potential explicitly .    the color singlet gauge potential shows center symmetry which is spontaneously broken in high temperature phase ( @xmath146 mev ) .",
    "when matter field is added the center symmetry is found to be broken explicitly , which leads to a metastable state in the temperature domain @xmath185 .",
    "the instability of the metastable state stabilizes for @xmath3mev and there are domains formed in the deconfined phase .",
    "we also discussed the phenomenological consequences of these center domains , both in pure gauge as well as with dynamical quarks , on color confining - deconfining phase transition or vice - versa in qcd , through the color singlet vis - a - vis polyakov loop potential .",
    "the center symmetry dictates that the confined phase appears as a color singlet object from the dynamical recombination of three partons as given in ( [ eq8 ] ) plus a confining background .",
    "this would solely describe the thermodynamic properties of color singlet structures like baryon , antibaryon , meson and glueball .",
    "most of the effects of heavy - ion collisions : non - perturbative nature of the deconfined phase , fluid nature , jet quenching , recombination of hadronization etc can be understood in terms of the center domains .",
    "more calculations in this direction are required to make quantitative predictions on the consequences of center domains in heavy - ion phenomenology .",
