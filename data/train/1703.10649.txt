    "currently , the relative uncertainty of @xmath16 for c@xmath1 is an order of magnitude better than that of @xmath18 , i.e. it does not hinder an improvement of @xmath6 .",
    "a further enhancement of the accuracy of the experimental frequency ratio @xmath18 is expected for any ion from the currently commissioned penning - trap setup alphatrap at the max planck institute for nuclear physics  @xcite . presently , the main limitations for such measurements are the interaction of the ion with the trap electrodes ( `` image charge shift '' ) and the thermal distribution of the ion s kinetic energy",
    ". the alphatrap setup will drastically reduce both effects . a larger trap diameter decreases the image charge effect by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the mainz @xmath2 factor experiment , and sympathetic laser cooling of the highly charged ions",
    "can potentially eliminate the limitation arising from the thermal distribution .",
    "combined , these improvements pave the way for a significant  approximately one order of magnitude  improvement in the measurement of the @xmath2 factor especially of light ions .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] shows that on the theoretical side , the main limitation arises from the accuracy of one - loop se terms of order @xmath70 and higher , which have been extracted from numerical calculations  @xcite . for low charge numbers ,",
    "such calculations are restricted by severe numerical cancellations .",
    "a significant improvement will nevertheless be possible in the nearest future  @xcite .",
    "another possibility to determine @xmath6 could be to employ an even lighter hydrogenlike ion , where qed binding corrections are further scaled down . at the current level of experimental accuracy , the lightest such ion , namely , he@xmath4 would deliver a valuable consistency check of the electron mass determination .",
    "one may extract @xmath6 from a he@xmath4 measurement just as accurately as from c@xmath1 , assuming the same fractional accuracy of @xmath18 in both experiments . a combined analysis including the he@xmath4 data and an accordingly extended system of equations [ see eq .",
    "( [ set - eq1 ] ) and ( [ set - eq2 ] ) ] would lead to a slightly reduced @xmath6 uncertainty even at the present level of experimental accuracy .",
    "the theoretical value of the @xmath2 factor has a significantly better relative accuracy for he@xmath4 than for c@xmath1 due to power scaling : e.g. , terms of order @xmath70 are scaled down by a factor of @xmath71 , i.e. by more than two orders of magnitude . in case of he@xmath4 , therefore , there is no need to estimate the so far uncalculated higher - order two - loop terms from the si experiment , nor include the very recently calculated virtual light - by - light scattering contributions .    with a further improvement of experimental accuracy by , e.g. , the alphatrap experiment , one can further improve @xmath6 both from c@xmath1 as well as from he@xmath20 .",
    "however , this improvement is limited approximately to a factor of 2 with he@xmath4 due to the current relative accuracy  @xcite @xmath72 of the he@xmath4 ion mass .",
    "the qed theory is not a limitation yet at this level , nor the c@xmath1 ion mass . at an even higher level of experimental accuracy ( more than a factor of 3 better than now )",

    "it can be extracted from the @xmath2 factor , and the latter is determined by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : massdet ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , a competitive determination of @xmath21 is limited by the fractional accuracy of @xmath6 , @xmath14 , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 .",
    "typically , the theoretical value of the @xmath2  factor is limited by the insufficient knowledge on nuclear parameters such as the charge radius . in the light",
    "he@xmath4 ion , nuclear size effects are naturally very small ; furthermore , the leading dependence on @xmath21 does not stem from binding effects , i.e. those scaling with some power of @xmath27 , but from the leading free - electron qed contribution , the schwinger term @xmath75 .",
    "[ fig : alphasens ] shows that he@xmath4 is the only h - like ion where the error of the @xmath2 factor due to the present uncertainty of @xmath21 is larger than the error due to the nuclear size effect .",
    "therefore , an improved determination of @xmath21 is possible at all .",
    "this will require , however , an improvement in the measurement of the frequency ratio @xmath18 by two orders of magnitude or better , a similar enhancement of @xmath6 from a c@xmath1 ion measurement or from some other source , and an improvement of the @xmath5he nuclear mass by some independent means .",
    "we note that for other elements where the nuclear uncertainties limit the determination of the fine - structure constant , schemes have been put forward to suppress nuclear structural effects .",
    "these contributions can be largely cancelled by appropriately chosen weighted differences of the @xmath2  factor of a hydrogenlike ion and the @xmath2  factor corresponding to some another charge state of the same element  @xcite , enabling a competitive extraction of  @xmath21 .",
    "the determination of @xmath21 from the @xmath2  factor of the lightly bound electron in he@xmath76 is closely related to the determination from the @xmath77 of the free electron , with the difference that theoretical binding corrections need to be subtracted first from the measured @xmath2  factor .",
    "after a foreseeable improvement of the numerical accuracy of the one - loop binding self - energy correction  @xcite , such an extraction of @xmath21 is , from a theoretical point of view , is dominantly limited by the accuracy of free - electron qed ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) . on the experimental side ,",
    "the measurement of the bound electrons @xmath2 factor differs significantly from that of the free electron . in the latter case , about three orders of magnitude in precision",
    "is gained by directly measuring @xmath78 rather than @xmath79 , which exploits the similarity of the electrons cyclotron and larmor frequencies . for the bound electron ,",
    "these two frequencies are however very dissimilar , thus the cyclotron frequency of the heavy ion has to be measured about three orders of magnitude more precisely to achieve a comparable precision .",
    "an advantage employing ions may be however the large reduction of relativistic shifts , which pose a severe limitation for free electrons .",
    "we presented an evaluation of the electron mass from penning - trap measurements of the larmor and cyclotron frequency ratio @xmath18 of a hydrogenlike @xmath7c@xmath1 ion , and the corresponding theoretical value of the bound - electron @xmath2  factor .",
    "so far uncalculated two - loop self - energy corrections of order @xmath70 or higher were estimated from the measured @xmath2 factor value of the @xmath80si@xmath29 ion .",
    "this evaluation includes , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , results of a non - perturbative calculation for the vpvp and sevp corrections  @xcite , and a two - loop virtual light - by - light scattering contribution of order @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the latter causes a shift of the extracted electron mass by 0.3  @xmath69 .",
    "prospects of further improving @xmath6 with @xmath0c@xmath1 or @xmath19he@xmath20 ions were discussed .",
    "measurements on the latter system also allow in principle an enhanced determination of the @xmath19he mass .",
    "a competitive determination of the fine - structure constant might be achieved in future from a measurement with @xmath19he@xmath20 ions , once an experimental improvement of @xmath18 by two orders of magnitude becomes possible .",
