    "a large number of possible forms for the gluon propagator , in various gauges , have been proposed .",
    "a brief review is available in ref .",
    "we confine ourselves here to a few remarks on some of the main themes that have been considered in the literature .",
    "we begin by noting that there is no evidence from lattice simulations for massless excitations coupled to the gluon propagator . in particular , a @xmath186 propagator , which would lead to a confining potential from one - gluon exchange @xcite ,",
    "is firmly ruled out .",
    "the possibility that the gluon propagator might vanish at zero momentum was first discussed by gribov , based on his work on gauge copies @xcite .",
    "he proposed that the gluon propagator has complex poles , leading to a gluon propagator of the form @xmath187 this leads to the vanishing of the gluon propagator at @xmath188 , and a peak in the gluon propagator at a non - zero momentum .",
    "others have also explored this possibility and possible generalizations @xcite .",
    "zwanziger has proven @xcite that the gluon propagator in lattice landau gauge ( @xmath189 ) is zero at @xmath190 in the infinite volume limit .",
    "his proof does not require the continuum limit , but does require that only configurations in a restricted region of configuration space , such as the fundamental modular region , be integrated over .",
    "there is evidence from some lattice simulations for a peak in the gluon propagator at very low wave number @xcite .",
    "however , extremely large lattices are required , and the propagator does not appear to be trending to zero at @xmath191 as the volume grows .    in our lattice simulations ,",
    "the gluon propagator does not vanish at @xmath190 and our best fit to the data does not indicate a peak to non - zero momentum .",
    "however , within the framework of our mixing model , it is possible for a peak to occur , depending on the values of various parameters .",
    "if the gluon propagator is initially rising with @xmath111 , it must eventually fall .",
    "thus the condition for a peak to occur is @xmath192 our measured parameters are such that this inequality never holds .",
    "we have also fit our data with the form used by cucchieri et al .  in ref .",
    "@xcite , a generalization of the gribov form .",
    "although a reasonable fit to the data is obtained , the @xmath193 is 50 - 100 times larger than that obtained with our quenched mixing form , and a peak is not always seen .",
    "when a peak does appear when fitting to the generalized gribov form , it occurs at very small non - zero momenta , directly accessible only on very large lattices .",
    "we conclude that a peak is a possible feature of the gluon propagator , but the existence of a peak is sensitive to the precise form used in fitting .",
    "such a peak may lack fundamental significance , particularly since it may only be directly observable on lattices much larger than the scale on which confinement appears .",
    "our results for the gluon propagator are similar to those of leinweber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who fit @xmath194 lattice landau gauge propagators to a variety of possible forms .",
    "they obtain a best fit with their model a , for which the propagator has the form @xmath195\\ ] ] where @xmath196 is a logarithmic factor mimicking one - loop corrections .",
    "their preferred value for their parameter @xmath197 is @xmath198 .",
    "this form is thus rather similar to our quenched mixing form , since for @xmath199 , it has a triple pole .",
    "of course , we have two mass scales , @xmath115 and @xmath144 , playing roles in the denominators .",
    "we have not explored the interesting possibility that the gluon propagator has an anomalous dimension , first suggested by marenzoni _ et al .",
    "this behavior could occur in our formulation .",
    "for example , the bubble diagram discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase_diag ] could give this behavior .",
    "however , high precision data as well as a detailed functional form for fitting would be needed to test for this behavior .",
    "we have shown in detail how the quenched character of lattice gauge fixing leads to violations of spectral positivity in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "although we have focused on lattice landau gauge , this problem is likely to occur in any lattice gauge fixing scheme in which the gauge fixing variables are determined subsequent to the generation of lattice gauge field configurations . a key step in our analysis",
    "has been the generalization of conventional lattice gauge fixing , where one configuration is chosen on the gauge orbit , to a formalism including a gauge - fixing parameter , similar to continuum gauge fixing .",
    "this parameter controls the weighting of configurations along the gauge orbit , and conventional lattice gauge fixing is formally recovered as a limiting case .",
    "we have not examined lattice gauge fixing schemes in which the gauge field integration is restricted to a subset of the entire configuration space , _",
    "e.g. _ , the fundamental modular domain , but the relation of these to standard computational practice is unclear .",
    "there are some lattice gauge fixing schemes , such as lattice laplacian gauge @xcite which are defined by a complicated algorithmic process , and may not generalize in a manner similar to lattice landau gauge .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the quenched character of these algorithms is the root of spectral positivity violation there as well .    we have focused here on the form of the gluon propagator , the extraction of masses , their interpretation and dependence on the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath171 .",
    "the issue of the continuum limit for gluon propagator masses has not yet been resolved . in the gauge - invariant sector , physical masses scale as the gauge coupling @xmath116 is taken to infinity in the manner prescribed by the renormalization group . in principle , it is also necessary to adjust @xmath171 to obtain a continuum limit of gauge - variant quantities . in other words , the running of the gauge - fixing parameter must be taken into account .",
    "this is similar to the running of the gauge - fixing parameter in covariant gauges in the continuum . if a meaningful gluon mass , independent of @xmath39 for large @xmath39 , can be extracted , it might scale correctly in the continuum limit without tuning @xmath39 .",
    "as we have observed , the mass @xmath200 is approximately independent of @xmath39 for large @xmath39 at @xmath201 , and has a value phenomenologically consistent with a constituent gluon mass .",
    "further study is required to see if @xmath144 and @xmath115 survive in the continuum limit .",
    "because the standard gluon operator creates a mixture of states , it is likely that a variational analysis @xcite using a several operators would give a better determination of @xmath144 and particularly @xmath115 .",
    "we have used the group @xmath3 to study gluon properties at zero temperature .",
    "perhaps the most important application of lattice gauge fixing is the measurement of electric and magnetic masses in the deconfined phase .",
    "we are extending our work to finite temperature @xmath3 , generalizing the work of refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of finite @xmath2 . however , it is @xmath194 which is of principal interest @xcite .",
    "because gauge fixing can be carried out any time after lattice field configurations are generated , it is relatively easy to study gauge fixing on available unquenched @xmath194 configurations . in that case",
    ", it would be possible to also examine the dependence of the quark mass on the gauge parameter @xmath2 .",

    "<S> the phase diagram of the lattice theory , as a function of the gauge coupling @xmath1 and the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath2 , is similar to that of the unquenched theory , a higgs model of a type first studied by fradkin and shenker . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon propagator is interpreted as yielding bound states in the confined phase , and a mixture of fundamental particles in the higgs phase , but lattice simulation shows the two phases are connected . </S>",
    "<S> gauge field propagators from the simulation of an @xmath3 lattice gauge theory on a @xmath4 lattice are well described by a quenched mass - mixing model . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the lightest state , which we interpret as the gluon mass , appears to be independent of @xmath2 for sufficiently large @xmath2 . </S>"
