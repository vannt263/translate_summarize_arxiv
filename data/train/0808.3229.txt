    "reaction - diffusion ( rd ) models have proven to be very useful tools for the study of chemical @xcite , biological @xcite , and ecological @xcite systems .",
    "rd models typically consist of a set of particles which are allowed to diffuse and interact with one another and their environment in prescribed ways . by varying the types of allowed reactions ,",
    "number of types of particles , and reaction rates , one can obtain a wide variety of behavior .",
    "much work has been done to examine the phase transition between active ( population survives as @xmath3 ) and absorbing ( population dies as @xmath3 ) states @xcite and to determine the nature of propagating fronts @xcite .",
    "typically , rd models are governed by a microscopic master equation @xcite which describes the probability flow into and out of the microstates of the system .",
    "this master equation is not solvable for all but the most simple models , and thus various approximation techniques  langevin equations , for example  are usually used . there",
    "does exist a systematic expansion of the master equation @xcite , the lowest order of which is usually a deterministic differential equation or fokker - planck equation for the mean concentrations of the constituent particles .",
    "these equations  reaction - diffusion equations  are often studied first as a means of characterizing the qualitative behavior of the model under examination ; they constitute a mean - field theory for the model .",
    "the effects of quenched disorder in the reaction rates on the critical behavior of rd models have been difficult to determine .",
    "a straightforward renormalization group treatment leads to runaway flows @xcite , but some progress has been made using simulations @xcite and real - space rg methods @xcite .",
    "disorder effects on rd fronts have also been studied , mostly for the case in which the disorder is time - dependent ( `` annealed '' ) and the system admits a front solution in the absence of noise @xcite .",
    "however , a few studies have been made of the effects of quenched disorder on rd fronts @xcite , and some attention has been devoted to the interesting case of noise - induced fronts @xcite .",
    "this work concerns the nature of transport in a particular reaction - diffusion system with spatial inhomogeneity in the reaction rates . we study a model with a mean - field limit defined by the generalized fisher / kpp equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the population density , @xmath6 is the diffusion constant , @xmath7 is a spatially uniform convection velocity ( representing the flow of some liquid in which the particles exist ) , @xmath8 is a spatially inhomogeneous growth term fixed in time , and @xmath9 is a competition term ( @xmath10 is a competition rate and @xmath11 is the microscopic length scale at which two particles will compete with one another ) .",
    "one of the simplest cases to consider is when @xmath12 everywhere except a small patch near the origin , where @xmath13 .",
    "the region of positive growth rate near the origin is called an `` oasis , '' while the rest of space is termed the `` desert . ''",
    "this model was previously studied by nelson and coworkers @xcite , and a microscopic model ( the contact process with disorder ) with this mean - field limit was studied by joo and lebowitz @xcite .",
    "both sets of researchers found a transition in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane between extinct , localized , and delocalized phases in finite systems with periodic boundary conditions : for high average growth rate and high convection velocity , they observed a delocalized phase ; for low average growth rate and high convection velocity they found that the population became extinct ; and for low average growth rate and low convection velocity they found a localized phase .",
    "these predictions were tested in a laboratory setting using bacteria protected from harmful uv light ( the `` desert '' ) by a mask ( the `` oasis '' ) ; the experiments largely confirmed the theoretical predictions summarized above @xcite .    in this paper , we will examine the nature of transport in a system consisting of many identical oases distributed randomly at low density in a desert .",
    "we term this low oasis density regime `` hostile '' ; the opposite case in which oases fill up most of space we call `` fertile . ''",
    "because transport between oases in such a system involves the movement of a low population density , fluctuations about the mean - field theory ( discreteness effects ) will be important .",
    "we will thus be examining a particular stochastic process with a mean - field limit given by ( [ fisherkpp ] ) .",
    "this process is easiest to introduce on a @xmath16 lattice ; the generalization to higher dimensions is trivial .",
    "identical particles ( labeled @xmath17 ) occupy lattice sites without occupation number limits and are allowed to undergo the following processes : hopping to either side with rate @xmath18 ( total hopping rate of @xmath19 ) ; death ( @xmath2 ) with rate @xmath20 if in the desert ; reproduction ( @xmath1 ) with rate @xmath21 if on an oasis ; and competition / coagulation ( @xmath0 ) with rate @xmath10 everywhere .",
    "this process is governed by a master equation for the joint probability @xmath22 to have occupation numbers @xmath23 on the lattice points @xmath24 at time @xmath25 :    @xmath26 + \\sum_{\\nu}y_{\\nu}\\left[(c_{\\nu}-1)p(\\ldots , c_{\\nu}-1,\\ldots , t)-c_{\\nu}p(\\{c\\},t)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & b\\sum_{\\nu}(c_{\\nu}+1)c_{\\nu}p(\\ldots , c_{\\nu}+1,\\ldots , t)-c_{\\nu}(c_{\\nu}-1)p(\\{c\\},t).\\label{mastereq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath27 on the oases and @xmath20 in the desert , and @xmath28 in the desert and @xmath21 on the oases .",
    "let us now present a brief outline of this paper : in section [ 1oasis ] , we will examine the nature of growth near a single oasis . because the mean - field equation for the steady - state population density is exactly solvable in one dimension , we will be able to identify a length scale describing the distance away from the oasis at which fluctuations about the mean - field theory become important .",
    "we will also briefly discuss in this section the problem of extinction . in section [ 2oases ]",
    ", we will look at transport between two oases . by using the fact that the @xmath0 competition process is unimportant far away from an oasis where the population is low",
    ", we will be able to devise a simpler model which captures the transport characteristics of the full model for large oasis separation . in section [ manyoases ]",
    ", we will finally tackle the problem of transport in a system with many oases . by employing an analogy with the problem of hopping conduction in doped semiconductors",
    ", we will estimate the time taken for a population to cross a large system .",
    "finally , we offer a summary of our results along with some remarks in section [ concl ] .",
    "much of the material in sections ( [ 2oases ] ) and ( [ manyoases ] ) has been described by us in an earlier publication in less detail @xcite .",
    "we begin with a study of the nature of population growth near a single oasis in mean - field theory , starting with a @xmath29d lattice with a single oasis of width @xmath30 lattice points centered at the origin .",
    "first , we multiply @xmath22 by @xmath31 in eq .",

    "there are two things we would like to know : first , what does the mean - field concentration @xmath44 look like as @xmath3 ?",
    "second , what is the time scale on which a small population grows into a substantial population ?",

    ", we consider a hyperspherical oasis of radius @xmath70 .",

    "to do so , we drop the nonlinear term from the mean - field equation ( [ fisherkpp ] ) under the assumption that @xmath72 is small far from the oasis .",
    "this leads to the linear equation @xmath73 which is valid far away from the oasis . in two dimensions ,",
    "this is solved by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a modified bessel function of the first kind . in three dimensions , @xmath77 . because finding an exact solution for the entire space ( including @xmath78 ) is no longer possible for @xmath79 or @xmath80",
    ", we can not write down an analytic expression for the prefactors @xmath68 in front of these asymptotic functional forms .    the question of the time scale on which a small population grows into a substantial population has been addressed by nelson and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the eigenvalue spectrum of the linearized ( @xmath59 ) version of ( [ fisherkpp ] ) and found that the largest eigenvalue @xmath81 is given by @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath84 which goes as @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 in the limit of large @xmath21 , then , @xmath89 , and the time scale on which a small population grows up is @xmath90 .",
    "it has been known for some time that fluctuations can drive a system to extinction even when mean - field theory predicts a stable active state . in the case of a continuous _ homogeneous _ system with the same reactions as our system@xmath1 with rate @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath2 with rate @xmath20 , and @xmath0 with rate @xmath10there is an active phase only when @xmath91 , where @xmath92 depends on dimension but is less than zero for @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "mean - field theory , on the other hand , predicts an active phase for @xmath94 ; fluctuations drive the critical growth rate up .",
    "the disparity between mean - field and stochastic behavior is even greater in the case of a @xmath95 system : mean - field theory predicts a @xmath3 steady state which is reached for any nonzero initial condition , but solving the master equation leads to the conclusion that , for any @xmath96 , the population will eventually become extinct @xcite .",
    "the mean extinction time in this case can be calculated exactly as a function of @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath10 , and the starting population @xmath97 , although the resulting expression is cumbersome to work with @xcite .    for the case of a single oasis in an infinite desert , it seems clear that the population will become extinct as @xmath3 for @xmath93 : the finite oasis can not compete with the infinite desert , regardless of how high the growth rate @xmath21 is . for the problem we will be considering ,",
    "it is important that the oases not die out too early , and thus we need to know the dependence of the mean extinction time on the various parameters of the problem .",
    "the field - theoretic tools used to analyze systems with translational invariance are hard to apply to this case , as are the various methods ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for one such method ) used to analyze @xmath95 systems .",
    "nonetheless , we can try to place a lower limit on the extinction time . to do so",
    ", we will return to the lattice case in one dimension ; our results will be applicable to the continuum case and to other dimensions .    consider the case of a perfectly deadly desert , @xmath98 .",
    "this effectively turns our system into a finite system with @xmath30 lattice points and absorbing boundaries .",
    "the `` effective '' death rate is of the order of @xmath19 , the hopping rate .",
    "now consider a @xmath95 system with the same birth and competition rates which has a death rate of @xmath19 , the hopping rate in our original system .",
    "our @xmath16 system will certainly live longer than this system , on average : the number of events needed to extinguish the population completely is much larger .",
    "as mentioned above , the mean extinction time for this @xmath95 system can be calculated explicitly , with the result that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a constant , for large @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the mean extinction time should rise at least exponentially with @xmath21 in our one oasis problem when @xmath21 is large . by choosing a large @xmath21 , then",
    ", we can ensure that extinction will not invalidate our results . from here on , we will assume that the growth rate on the oases is large enough that extinction is unlikely on the transport time scales in question .",
    "our eventual goal is to understand the transport of a population across a system filled with oases at low density .",
    "the first step towards such an understanding is to determine the nature of transport between two oases .",
    "consider two oases of radius @xmath70 in @xmath101 dimensions .",
    "the center of one oasis is located at the origin , and the center of the other oasis is located at position @xmath102 . at @xmath103 ,",
    "the first oasis is populated and the second oasis is empty .",
    "we wish to find the infection time  that is , the time it takes for a population to take hold and reach a significant level on the second oasis .",
    "this time can be roughly broken into two parts : @xmath104 , the time it takes particles from the first oasis to reach the second oasis ; and @xmath105 , the time it takes the population to rise to a significant level once the second oasis has been reached .",
    "we will assume that the first particle to reach the second oasis will reproduce and that its offspring will not die out ; in other words , we will take @xmath104 to be the first passage time ( fpt ) of the process .",
    "this assumption can be satisfied in two ways : the first way is simply to make the growth rate @xmath21 of the oases very high . in this case , it is possible to estimate how the survival probability increases as @xmath21 increases .",
    "consider again the case of a very deadly desert : if the particle diffuses off the oasis , it is certainly dead ; thus , there is an effective death rate of order @xmath106 .",
    "for the case of a very small oasis , then , a toy model of the oasis is a @xmath95 system with death rate of @xmath106 .",
    "for this case , it is known that the survival probability goes like @xmath107 @xcite , and thus making @xmath21 very high assures that the population will take hold and survive .",
    "a second way of satisfying our assumption is to seed the oases with a second species of particles , @xmath108 , which interact with the @xmath17 particles via the reaction @xmath109 at a very high rate .",
    "the time @xmath105 that it takes the initially small population on the second oasis to grow to a macroscopic size should go roughly like @xmath110 for large @xmath21 , and so choosing a large @xmath21 should also serve to make @xmath111 .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we will assume that @xmath21 is large enough so that this is the case .",
    "note that by taking @xmath21 to be very high , we have done three things : first , we have ensured that a small population which reaches a new oasis grows into a sizable population and does not die out , which allows us to identify the first passage time with the transit time ; second , we have made the time for this growth small compared to the transit time ; and finally , as mentioned in the previous section , we have ensured that extinction will only occur on a time scale much larger than the one associated with transit .",
    "consider the case where the two oases are close together : particles from the first oasis diffuse out in a front , its amplitude decaying due to the death term in the desert and competition effects .",
    "however , so long as the second oasis is close enough that the edge of the front is almost certain to possess many particles ( the number will vary from realization to realization of the stochastic process ) , the transit time should simply go as @xmath112 , the oasis separation .",
    "however , once @xmath112 is well above some length scale we will call @xmath113 , this is no longer true : the front simply does not exist in most realizations of the system , as the number of particles present at this distance from the first oasis is quite small for all times . in this regime ,",
    "the second oasis is reached not by a front but by a stray particle ( or some stray particles ) that manages to make it through the desert ; it is essentially a noise - induced growth process .",
    "@xmath113 can thus be roughly defined as the distance from the oasis at which the large - time average concentration falls to @xmath114 .",
    "we have already analyzed the mean - field equations for the average concentration as @xmath3 , and found that , except in @xmath16 , there are no closed - form solutions . in one dimension , setting the mean - field @xmath3 average concentration ( [ c1dssdes ] ) for large @xmath21 equal to @xmath115 and solving for @xmath113 leads to @xmath116 in the limit of large @xmath117 , this simplifies to @xmath118 , where @xmath10 is @xmath119 .",
    "if @xmath21 is smaller , the relevant length scale will also be smaller .",
    "we believe that this length scale should be of the same order of magnitude in higher dimensions , and so ( [ rlin1d ] ) should also provide a rough estimate of @xmath113 for @xmath79 and @xmath120 .      as we move further from the first oasis ,",
    "the competition process @xmath0 becomes less and less important , especially if @xmath10 is small compared to the other rates in the problem . due to this fact",
    ", it is natural to wonder if ignoring these interactions altogether might be the first step in the creation of a tractable model with the same large distance first passage properties as the full model with competition .",
    "we will now propose such a model , which has been discussed by us in an earlier work @xcite : consider replacing the first oasis with desert , and then placing a point source in the middle that produces non - interacting particles at some average rate @xmath121 .",
    "the master equation for this process on a lattice in @xmath16 can be written as    @xmath122 + g\\left[p(\\ldots , n_{0}-1,\\ldots , t)-p(\\{n\\},t)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath123 is the joint probability to have occupation numbers @xmath124 on the lattice points @xmath24 at time @xmath25 .",
    "for an appropriately chosen @xmath121 , the mean flux of particles past the surface at @xmath113 should match that of the model with competitions ; beyond that point , the model with a source differs from the model with competitions only in that it ignores the rare annihilation interactions between particles .",
    "we will show that , for an appropriately chosen @xmath121 , this model  which we will refer to as the linear model with a source  accurately captures the first passage properties of the full nonlinear model with competition .    as with the full nonlinear model with competition ( hereafter referred to as the nonlinear model )",
    ", it is useful to analyze the mean - field behavior of the linear model with a source .",

    "the relevant mean - field equation in this case is simply ( [ mflinwsource ] ) . after a laplace transform ,",

    "the first of these differences is insignificant since we have already assumed that @xmath105 is much smaller than a typical value of @xmath104 for oases separated by a large distance .",
    "the second difference is more important , and some of its implications will be discussed in detail later in this paper .",
    "the problem of determining the resistivity ( or conductivity ) of a doped semiconductor in the hopping regime was first tackled satisfactorily using ideas from percolation theory by ambegaokar and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they found that the resistivity is dominated by the largest links in the network of impurity sites spanning the system .",
    "any links with much larger resistances are effectively shunted by the smaller resistances , and are not important in determining the macroscopic resistivity .",
    "the size of the largest link @xmath242 can be determined using continuum percolation theory , which works in roughly the following way : a circle ( or sphere ) is drawn around each impurity site , and the radius of each circle is increased . when an impurity site center comes within the circle centered around another impurity site ,",
    "the two are said to be linked . when the radii of the circles are increased to the point where a cluster of linked sites connects one side of the system to another",
    ", we have reached the percolation threshold .",
    "the last link to form is clearly the longest link , and we call its length @xmath242",

    "the quantity @xmath244 has an interpretation as the mean number of connected neighbors for members of the percolation cluster @xcite .",
    "the network which carries the majority of the current in doped semiconductors is called the critical subnetwork , and its correlation length is @xmath246 ( this is also the length scale at which sample - to - sample variations in @xmath247 become relatively small , of order @xmath29 ) @xcite . above this length scale , the system can be regarded as homogeneous , and so the resistivity of a large system of size @xmath248 is roughly equal to the resistivity of a system of size @xmath246 . as argued above , this resistivity",
    "is largely determined by the resistance across the largest link , which is equal to @xmath249 ( @xmath250 has units of conductance and @xmath251 is equal to the inverse ) .",
    "the resistivity @xmath252 is then given by @xcite @xmath253 with the correlation length @xmath246 given approximately by @xmath254 where @xmath201 is the number density of impurity sites and @xmath24 is a critical exponent equal to @xmath255 in @xmath79 and @xmath256 in @xmath120 .",
    "now let us return to our problem .",
    "consider a system of the size of the correlation length @xmath246 of the subcritical network with one oasis initially infected at one edge of the system . in the hopping conduction problem , the goal is to find the resistance between the edges of the system ; in our problem , it is to find the first passage time between the starting oasis and either a specific oasis on the opposite edge or any oasis in a thin layer close to the opposite edge .",
    "unlike the hopping conduction problem , our problem is dynamic in nature ; an additional difference is that , as mentioned previously , our first passage times are random variables with a distribution whose mean increases exponentially with oasis separation rather than fixed resistances with an exponential dependence on link size .",
    "the mean fpt across the system is thus an average of a minimum : for a fixed set of oases , each realization of the dynamic process yields a path with minimal first passage time which may differ from the paths from other realizations .",
    "however , there is at least one large link of size @xmath257 which must be crossed in order for the population to reach the opposite edge of the system , and the time to cross this link sets the time scale to cross the system in the same way the that the resistance of the largest link sets the scale of the resistance in the hopping conduction problem .",
    "thus , @xmath258 where @xmath259 is given by ( [ 2dcontmoms ] ) or ( [ 3dcontmoms ] ) depending on the dimensionality of the system",
    ".    now consider a very large system .",
    "we wish to find the mean infection time @xmath260that is , the mean time for the population to travel between oases separated by some large distance @xmath248 .",
    "this time is roughly equal to the mean fpt in the parameter regime in which we re interested ( that is , the limit of high growth rate on the oases ) . in order to do this ,",
    "we need to know something about the large - scale structure of the cluster of oases which will carry the bulk of the particle current . again , looking at the hopping conduction problem is instructive . in that problem",
    ", the links - nodes - blobs picture @xcite suggests that the current - carrying cluster can be thought of as a network of nodes separated by a distance on the order of @xmath246 connected by one - dimensional links and clusters ( or blobs ) of links .",
    "since the resistance of a link depends exponentially on its length , the largest one - dimensional links of approximate size @xmath242 largely determine the resistance between nodes , and thus the resistivity of the system , as noted in the previous section .",
    "( there is some debate as to whether there exists another length scale @xmath261 which , together with @xmath246 , characterizes the structure of the current - carrying cluster .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this problem . )    as a first approximation ,",
    "let us consider our system as consisting of nodes placed on a hypercubic lattice with lattice spacing @xmath246 with one large link of size @xmath242 in between each node .",
    "we ignore the time to cross the shorter links and the variations in the oasis configurations from one correlation - length - sized chunk to another .",
    "the population starts at one node , and we seek the first passage time to some distant node located a distance @xmath262 away along a lattice basis vector ( or , equivalently , @xmath263 lattice points away ) .",
    "this is the basic problem of _ first passage percolation _",
    "( fpp ) , a field largely studied in the mathematical community @xcite .",
    "one of the basic results of fpp is that , as the separation between nodes @xmath264 , the fpt @xmath265 divided by @xmath201 goes to a constant @xmath266 , conventionally called the time constant .",
    "thus , the mean fpt rises linearly with distance between sites , indicating that the proper intensive quantity for our problem is the mean fpt divided by oasis separation ; in the doped semiconductor problem , the proper intensive quantity is the resistivity .",
    "the value of @xmath266 depends on the underlying fpt probability distribution , but a general result is that @xmath267 , where @xmath268 is the average time to cross one link @xcite .",
    "( that is , @xmath268 is the mean of the distribution from which fpts are picked for each link between nodes . ) for the case where the times are chosen from an exponential distribution , @xmath269 in two dimensions @xcite . in general , @xmath268 is an upper limit on @xmath266 @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in obtaining a rough estimate of the infection time , we will simply use the upper limit @xmath268 ( the mean time to cross one link ) as an estimate for @xmath270 .",
    "this gives us the following : @xmath271 where @xmath272 is again given by ( [ 2dcontmoms ] ) in @xmath79 and ( [ 3dcontmoms ] ) in @xmath120 , and @xmath246 is given by ( see ( [ corr - semi ] ) ) @xmath273 this result is an order - of - magnitude estimate , but it should capture the dependence of @xmath274 on the relevant parameters of the system .",
    "it is probably good to stop at this point and briefly recall the approximations that we have made to obtain the result in ( [ tinfresult ] ) : first , we have ignored the growth time on the grounds that it is small compared to the transit time between oases ; second , we have simplified the picture of transport on the scale of @xmath246 , replacing the mess of oases with a single link of size @xmath242 ; and third , we have used an upper limit on the time constant rather than the time constant itself .",
    "it should be noted that the first and second approximations tend to lead to underestimating @xmath274 , while the third tends to lead to overestimating it .      in order to confirm the predictions of the preceding section",
    ", we wrote a program capable of simulating a very large system in two dimensions . to make the simulation of such a large system tractable",
    ", we made some important simplifications which must be explained .",
    "the first of these is the most important : rather than simulating the motion of individual particles , we simply assigned first passage times between oases .",
    "this allowed us to go to system sizes many orders of magnitude larger than we could have achieved via a full kinetic monte carlo simulation involving every particle .",
    "the second simplification involves the nature of the fpt pdf used to generate the passage times between oases .",
    "the linear theory with a source produces an analytical expression for this fpt pdf ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 2dfptpdf ] ) and ( [ zdef ] ) ) , but this is unwieldy and computationally expensive to calculate .",
    "however , for large @xmath112 , the moments of this fpt pdf in @xmath79 approach those of an exponential distribution with parameter @xmath275 ( see [ 2dcontmoms ] ) , where @xmath49 .",
    "since it is the large-@xmath112 separations which will largely determine the infection time , we simply replaced the complicated fpt pdf between oases with this exponential distribution ; the errors introduced by this simplification are serious only for small oasis separations , and these do not contribute much to the infection time .",
    "the remaining simplifications are minor : we treated all the oases as points ; we ignored the growth time , just as we have done in the analytical work presented in the preceding sections ; and finally , we ignored the effects of neighboring oases on the first - passage time statistics between two oases .",
    "this final simplification again introduces errors mostly in areas of high oasis density where oasis separations are small .",
    "the bottlenecks of our particle current - carrying cluster occur where there are two oases separated by a large region of desert , and in these areas the fpt statistics should be very close to those derived in the case of two oases in an infinite desert .    before presenting our simulation results , we must first provide some details of the way time was scaled in our simulations . with the simplifications we have made , the fpt pdf @xmath276 between a pair of oases of radii @xmath70 separated by a distance @xmath112 can be obtained from ( [ 2dfptpdf ] ) .",
    "it is given by : @xmath277.\\ ] ] if we define the variable @xmath278effectively measuring time in units of the mean time to cross a link of size @xmath242we can absorb the dependence of the fpt pdf on @xmath70 and @xmath121 into @xmath279 .",

    "if our theory is correct , the mean time to cross one block of size @xmath246 in these units ( in units of @xmath279 ) should be of order @xmath29 , and the mean infection time should be @xmath284 if @xmath285 and @xmath242 are adjusted in such a way so that their product remains constant , then this amounts to a trivial rescaling of space , and @xmath286 should simply vary as @xmath287 .",
    "this is already captured through the dependence of @xmath288 on @xmath246 , and so we can rewrite ( [ tauinf1 ] ) as @xmath289 where @xmath290 is some function of order unity .",
    "we thus expect that a graph of @xmath291 versus @xmath292 for large @xmath262 should be a straight line with slope of order @xmath29 .    for each simulation run , @xmath285 and the oasis density @xmath201",
    "were input , @xmath242 and @xmath246 were calculated from ( [ rmax ] ) and ( [ corr - fpp ] ) , respectively , and a starting oasis was chosen near the center of the system .",
    "the simulation then proceeded one infection event at a time , with infection times between oases generated using the distribution given in ( [ fptfortausimp ] ) . in order to speed up the simulation",
    ", we set a maximum distance @xmath293 beyond which oases were effectively disconnected .",
    "this allowed us to generate new oases `` on - the - fly '' as the simulation proceeded ; together with our practice of throwing away information about an oasis once it was reached , this allowed us to only keep a small subset of oases in memory at any one time , thus allowing for the simulation of very large systems .",
    "the value of @xmath293 was chosen so as to make the probability of a missed event  that is , a jump event of size larger than @xmath293 occurring over the course of the simulation  very small ( @xmath294 ) .",
    "in early simulation runs , we found that our starting oasis would sometimes be isolated from the rest of the cluster , leading to larger - than - expected infection times with a large contribution from the time for the population to make the first jump . in the limit as @xmath295the large - distance limit we re interested in  this contribution to the infection time , which does not grow with @xmath262 , should become negligible , but for finite values of @xmath262 it can be important .",
    "in order to eliminate this effect from our simulations without going to system sizes too large to be simulated in a reasonable amount of time , we allowed the population to `` find '' the cluster : we restarted the simulation once an oasis at least @xmath296 from the starting oasis had been hit with the newly hit oasis as the new starting oasis .",

    "the results of the simulation are shown in fig .",

    "the data confirms our picture of transport : the slopes of the best - fit lines through the data are indeed of order @xmath29 , suggesting that @xmath242 is the correct length scale of the largest jumps the population must make on its way through the system and that @xmath246 is the correct length scale for the distance between these large jumps ( of course , the population left behind the front edge will eventually make larger jumps to infect isolated oases , but this is unimportant in trying to determine the infection time ) .",
    "note that there are some `` missing '' points on the two lines with the highest @xmath298 .",
    "this is due to the presence of oases inside those rings which were not hit before the simulation time ended .",
    "as @xmath298 is increased , such outlying oases take longer to hit , but since their `` extra '' contribution to the mean transit time does not scale with @xmath262 , they do not affect our @xmath295 results .    the slope for each line is equal to the scaling function @xmath290 for those values of @xmath285 and @xmath242 ; note that @xmath290 appears to increase for increasing values of @xmath298 .",
    "this is likely due to that fact that , as @xmath298 increases , the correlation length @xmath246 increases , and thus the number of smaller oasis separations between the large oasis separations increases as well .",

    "such systems have been used in the past to model bacterial population dynamics and the movement of plankton in the oceans .",

    "we have considered the limit in which the growth rate on the oases is very high and the oasis density is very low ; in this limit , the time needed for a small population to grow on an oasis is much smaller than the typical time needed to jump from oasis to oasis , and thus transport can be thought of as a first passage process .",
    "because the population density traveling from one oasis to another is small , it is necessary to consider discreteness effects . in order to determine the first passage time probability density function ( fpt pdf ) between two oases , we have employed a simplified model in which competition is ignored and the initially infected oasis is replaced by a particle source .",
    "simulations suggest that this model correctly predicts the fpt pdf for large oasis separations .",
    "we have used an analogy with the theory of hopping conduction to argue that the largest oasis separations in the particle current - carrying cluster largely determine the time taken for a population to travel to a given target .",

    "there is a significant difference between the two problems : ours is dynamic , while the hopping conduction problem is not .",
