    "quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) predicts the existence of glueballs . after a long time of experimental and theoretical exploration for glueballs , there is no obvious evidence to confirm its existence yet , even though people find several glueball candidates , such as @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite .",
    "there are also predictions on the mass of glueballs in various theoretical frameworks . among all the theoretical approaches ,",
    "the estimation on the mass of glueballs by the lattice qcd and qcd sum rules , seems to be closer to reality .",
    "the lattice qcd predicts the mass of the scalar glueball ( @xmath0 ) as @xmath3gev @xcite . with the qcd sum rules , novikov and narison evaluated the mass of scalar glueball as @xmath4@xcite , whereas bagan and steele considered the radiative corrections and obtained the mass as @xmath5@xcite .",
    "later , based on bagan and steele s work , huang",
    "_ , re - estimated the mass and found a small shift to @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the difference is so large that one has reason to doubt if there indeed exists theoretical discrepancy .",
    "one compelling motivation is that one needs to make a complete calculation which should add up the contributions which were neglected in previous calculations .",
    "that is the aim of this work .",
    "we have repeated bagan and steele s derivations , and noticed that they neglected the contributions of the fermions to the radiative corrections .",
    "namely , they neglected contributions of the loops involving fermion propagators and quark condensates by setting @xmath7 which is a coefficient related to quark flavors , to be zero in @xcite .",
    "they argued , such contributions were small compared to others . in this work",
    "we include the contributions of the loops containing fermion propagators and quark condensates to the correlation function @xmath8 . with this correction",
    ", we set a proper platform at @xmath9 gev , where @xmath10 represents the threshold for the continuum states , and eventually we determine the mass of the glueball as @xmath11 .",
    "this value is compatible with that obtained by bagan and steele , a bit larger than that huang et al .",
    "achieved , but within a tolerable error region , all of them are consistent with each other .",

    "the @xmath35 stands for the fermion part . with ope , we have @xmath36 where",
    ", @xmath17 is defined above .",

    "the ratio of the contribution of the unit operator term @xmath51 , which stands for the pertubative part , to the mass determined by @xmath25 is more than @xmath52 , it enables the ope expansion to converge sufficiently fast .",
    "besides , in the region , the ratio of the contribution of the continuum part to the mass is less than @xmath53 .",
    "it implies that this value of @xmath10 is appropriate for the quark - hardron duality . within this platform",
    "we have obtained the @xmath0 glueball mass as : @xmath54 , where the error is caused by the variable of the @xmath10 in the region , meanwhile , the error caused by the variable of the borel parameter @xmath21 is very tiny so that it can be ignored .",
    "fig ( 2-a ) and fig ( 2-b ) show that , the quark condensate contributes little to the mass of the glueball , since the @xmath41 given in eq ( [ c3 definition ] ) turns to zero at @xmath55 .",
    "that is why we could directly determine the mass of glueball by neglecting @xmath41 as long as the mass of light quarks is small .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the contribution of the diagrams involving internal fermion lines and quark condensates . following the traditional way",
    ", we determinate the mass of the @xmath0 scalar glueball as @xmath56 . comparing the result of huang ( @xmath57 ) , a little shift of the mass",
