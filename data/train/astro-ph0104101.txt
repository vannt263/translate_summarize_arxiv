    "observations of galactic black hole candidates ( bhcs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have gone a long way in obtaining very detailed information on these sources .",
    "the analysis of x - ray data revealed the existence of at least four distinct spectral states in bhcs , defined on the basis of the spectral shape and the flux level ( see e.g. tanaka & lewin @xcite ; narayan , mahadevan & quataert @xcite for reviews ) . in the high ( soft ) state",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a soft thermal component , commonly attributed to a standard accretion disc . in the low ( hard ) state a power - law high energy tail , probably originated by the comptonization of soft photons by a hotter medium , dominates the spectrum .",
    "usually , as the flux decreases , the power - law component becomes more and more pronounced , while the thermal one weakens and eventually disappears .",
    "optical / uv / x - ray agn spectra consist of three main components : a big blue bump , a soft x - ray excess , a hard power - law tail with a reflection hump and a high - energy cut - off ( see e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . as it was realized long ago , by shifting a typical agn spectrum to higher energies by a factor @xmath4 , such that the big blue bump falls in the 1 - 10 kev band , one obtains a x - ray spectrum which closely resembles that of a typical bhc in an intermediate state .",
    "the actual similarity between these two classes of sources ( modulo the energy shift ) is corroborated by a number of observational evidences ( see e.g. grebenev et al .",
    "@xcite ; grebenev , sunyaev & pavlinsky @xcite for the properties of power - law tails and zdziarski , lubiski & smith @xcite for the spectral index - compton reflection hump correlation ) .    in the last few years",
    ", a great wealth of information on the physical conditions in bhcs has come from the study of their variability . besides transitions among different spectral states ( on time - scales @xmath5 hour-1 month ) , time analysis revealed much more rapid variations , ranging from very low ( mhz ) to high - frequency ( 100 hz ) qpos . in some sources ( e.g. grs 1915 + 105 ) phase lags between photons in different x - ray bands",
    "have been detected , with typical values in the range 10 - 1000 ms ( cui et al .",
    "@xcite ; reig et al .",
    "@xcite ; cui , zhang & chen @xcite ; pottschmidt et al .",
    "if the characteristic times scale linearly with the black hole mass , as one naively expects , the shortest variability in agns should occur on @xmath6 hours - days .",
    "up to now , no definite evidence for qpos nor phase lags has been reported in agns , although multi - wavelength observations of some active galaxies seem to indicate a correlated variability between the optical - uv and x - ray fluxes ( clavel et al .",
    "@xcite ; edelson et al .",
    "@xcite ; nandra et al .",
    "time delays of a few days between the optical - uv and x - ray bands could be detectable , providing a powerful tool to probe the geometry of the accretion flow in the nuclear regions , as recently suggested by zampieri et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analogies between the spectral properties in the optical / uv / x - ray bands and , possibly , the variability patterns in bhcs and agns suggest that in both classes of sources the same basic mechanism might be responsible for the observed emission .",
    "much effort was devoted in recent years to envisage a `` unified '' scenario that has been partially successful in explaining the different spectral states in bhcs .",
    "the current picture is based on a two - component accretion flow : a standard disc and a hotter phase which could be advection - dominated ( see e.g. narayan , mahadevan & quataert @xcite ) .",
    "the different states are then produced by the varying importance of the two components .",
    "however , specific models do not provide a consistent description for the structure and evolution of the accretion flow .",
    "it has been known since a long time that the inner regions of a standard disc are thermally and viscously unstable ( e.g. pringle , rees & pacholczyk @xcite ; shapiro , lightman & eardely @xcite ; ichimaru @xcite ) .",
    "this suggested the intriguing possibility that the observed spectral transitions may be triggered by such instabilities .",
    "a definite answer should be sought in terms of a time - dependent hydrodymical approach , such as that adopted by honma , matsumoto & kato @xcite and szuszkiewicz & miller @xcite , @xcite . in particular , the latter authors have calculated the non - linear ( global ) evolution of transonic accretion discs produced by the onset of a thermal instability driven by radiation pressure and have shown that the evolution follows a cyclic pattern , passing through successive stages of evacuation and replenishment of the inner disc region ( see also takeuchi & mineshige @xcite ) .",
    "ultimately , in order to get detailed theoretical predictions for the observed quantities , it is necessary to compute the spectra emitted during the instability cycle .",
    "model spectra should properly take into account for the effects of the disc atmosphere , through which energy deposition is likely to take place at different heights .",
    "models of disc atmospheres have been already presented ( ladous @xcite ; shimura & takahara @xcite ) and some thought has been given to the problem of energy deposition ( shaviv & wehrse @xcite ; hubeny @xcite ) .",
    "the first thorough investigation of the vertical structure and emission spectrum of a thin accretion disc has been presented by shimura & takahara @xcite , who found that , for intermediate accretion rates , local spectra , emitted from each disc annulus , can be approximated by a planckian with an average hardening factor @xmath7 .",
    "investigations of the spectra emitted by steady - state , dissipative accretion discs in agns have been carried out by sincell & krolik @xcite ( standard discs ) and wang et al .",
    "@xcite ( slim discs ) .",
    "recently , hubeny and co - workers ( @xcite and references therein ) reported on the progress in their long term programme to construct detailed spectra from stationary , thin accretion discs in agns .    in this paper we compute spectra under the slim - disc approximation , which is appropriate for modeling intrinsically bright sources and allows us to follow the non - stationary evolution of a disc subject to a thermal instability .",
    "we will assume that energy deposition takes place entirely in the disc .",
    "more complex situations in which energy deposition occurs also in the atmosphere will be considered in a follow - up paper .",
    "this work is part of an ongoing research programme dedicated to the analysis of hydrodynamical instabilities in slim accretion discs and to the modeling of the spectral and variability properties of bhcs , in particular of the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 . in this paper",
    "we compute the spectra that emerge from slim discs during their instability cycle and discuss their possible relevance for the soft spectral component of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ hydro ]",
    "we describe the structure and evolution of thermally unstable transonic disc , concentrating on those properties relevant to spectral calculations . in section [ radtra ]",
    "our approach to the solution of radiative transfer in the disc atmosphere is outlined .",
    "computed spectra are presented in section [ result ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in section [ conclu ] .",
    "thermally unstable discs may undergo a limit - cycle behaviour with successive evacuation and refilling of their central parts . by means of a full time - dependent hydrodynamical simulation , szuszkiewicz & miller",
    "@xcite explored in detail a model with black hole mass @xmath8 , initial accretion rate @xmath9 ( in eddington units ) and viscosity parameter @xmath10 . in this particular model",
    "the cycle has a duration of about 780 s and can be divided into two distinct parts : a very short ( @xmath11 s ) outburst phase , during which the inner part of the disc is evacuated , and a quiescent stage ( corresponding to the slow refilling ) lasting for @xmath12 s. we have chosen four particular snapshots during the disc evolution for which to calculate emergent spectra .",
    "they correspond to the end of the refilling phase , just before the outburst starts ( model 1 ) , the peak of the outburst ( the maximal evacuation stage , model 2 ) , the beginning ( model 3 ) , and half way through the refilling phase ( model 4 ) . the theoretical bolometric light curve together with the positions of the four chosen snapshots is shown in fig . [ light ] .",
    "7.8 cm    in this section we discuss the radial structure of the disc for each of the four stages .",
    "the electron temperature distributions for models 1 - 4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ temp ] ; unless stated otherwise , hereafter all lengths are in units of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath13 . before the instability sets in ( model 1 )",
    "the temperature profile is that given by the solid line , labeled 1 in fig .",
    "[ temp ] . at the onset of the instability ,",
    "two density waves are sent out from the locally - unstable region , one moving inwards and the other outwards . at the same time",
    "the temperature rises significantly in the unstable region . as the outgoing wave progresses the temperature peak",
    "is reduced ( model 2 ) but remains still above that of model 1 .",
    "another effect of the propagating wave is to push a significant amount of matter outwards leaving behind an underdense region .",
    "this can be seen in fig . [ density ] where the volume density is plotted against radius .",
    "the outgoing wave heats the material through which it passes , causing the perturbed part of the disc to swell up , as shown in fig .",
    "[ thick ] .",
    "7.8 cm    during the evacuation phase the disc temperature is high .",
    "however , once the wavefront has moved beyond the linearly unstable region , the disc can not remain at such a high temperature for a very long time .",
    "eventually the front weakens and the temperature falls dramatically ( model 3 ) .",
    "after this , the underdense region begins to fill up on a viscous time - scale .",
    "this increase in density is associated with a progressive rise in the temperature .",
    "7.5 cm    7.5 cm    a quantity of immediate interest for spectral calculations is the effective optical thickness of the disc , @xmath14^{1/2}$ ] ; here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the scattering and absorption depths respectively .",
    "as shown in fig [ taueff ] , during the the maximal evacuation stage ( model 2 ) the effective optical depth drops slightly below unity in the disc inner region .",
    "7.5 cm    however , @xmath17 is sufficiently large to safely assume that the radiation field in the disc is in lte",
    ". then , close to the equatorial plane the radiation intensity approaches a blackbody . in traversing",
    "the disc atmospheric layers radiation goes out of equilibrium and scattering effects are likely to change the spectrum , as we will discuss in more detail in section [ result ] . the total flux distribution for each stage of the evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ flux ] . neglecting relativistic effects , the total luminosity of the disc in the four different stages @xmath18 can be computed integrating the flux over the disc surface ( see table [ tabmod ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath18 becomes larger than the eddington limit in the outburst phase .",
    "super - eddington luminosities may indeed be produced during the non - steady evolution and/or in a non - spherical flow . in this particular case",
    ", this happens because of the significant transient increase in the disc temperature .",
    "the flux together with the disc thickness will be used in the next section to calculate the emergent spectra .",
    "in this section we outline the numerical method used in computing the evolution of the radiation spectrum emitted by the transonic accretion disc . as discussed previously ( see section [ hydro ] ) , we consider four stages that correspond to the maximal evacuation stage ( model 2 ) and three replenishment stages ( model 1 , 3 and 4 ) .    the radial grid of each numerical disc model is made up of @xmath6250 points dividing the integration domain , @xmath19 , into a succession of comoving annular zones , each one @xmath20 more massive than the one interior to it .",
    "the mass of the innermost zone was determined in accordance with numerical convenience . in order to compute the spectrum of these models ,",
    "we introduce coarser radial zones ( or rings ) whose width is fixed by the requirement that their contribution to the total luminosity is @xmath21 .",
    "we have found more convenient to keep the ring boundaries coincident with the mesh points of the hydrodynamic calculation , avoiding unnecessary interpolations . the luminosity @xmath22 and average height @xmath23 of each ring",
    "are then computed as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the radial mesh and grid spacing of the time - dependent hydrodynamic code , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the radiative flux and disc height ( evaluated at the mid - point ) and @xmath29 is the number of radial points within the ring .",
    "clearly , since the ring luminosity is calculated as the sum of the contributions from the original zones , it differs slightly from one annulus to another . in terms of the width @xmath30 and the average radius @xmath31 of each ring",
    ", the luminosity can be approximately written as    @xmath32    we found that the aforementioned zoning procedure guarantees a sufficient accuracy when summing up all the rings and comparing the total disc luminosity to that computed from the output of the transfer calculation .",
    "however , especially in model 2 , the temperature may change significantly within a ring and this contrasts the assumption , which will be introduced later on , that it may be approximated as isothermal .",
    "therefore , we further ask that the fractional temperature variation in each ring does not exceed @xmath33 , independently of the zone luminosity . because the outermost zones of the original grid do not contribute appreciably to the total luminosity , they are grouped together into one single broad ring .",
    "typically , this procedure results in a total number of rings @xmath34 ( see table [ tabmod ] for details ) .",
    "the calculation of the radiation spectrum from each annulus proceeds in a way similar to that of shimura & takahara ( @xcite ; @xcite ) for shakura - sunyaev discs .",
    "each ring is characterized by its luminosity and height above the mid - plane , and is approximated as ( radially ) isothermal .",
    "no energy dissipation occurs in the disc atmosphere that is then in radiative energy equilibrium .",
    "all the radiative flux is produced in the disc and enters the atmosphere from below .",
    "consequently , the radiative luminosity is constant throughout the atmosphere , @xmath35 .",
    "the vertical structure is computed solving the coupled hydrostatic , energy and transfer equations in a plane - parallel , completely ionized , hydrogen layer . solving the transfer of radiation in a geometrically thin _",
    "plane parallel _",
    "slab is formally very similar to solving the corresponding problem in a geometrically thin _",
    "radial _ atmosphere .",
    "thus we decided to model the disc atmosphere using the same equations considered by zampieri et al .",
    "@xcite for a static , spherically symmetric , hydrogen atmosphere around a neutron star . the equations have been slightly modified neglecting general relativistic corrections , taking into account for the radial displacement of the ring from the center of gravity and suppressing the energy release within the atmosphere .",
    "the scattering depth @xmath36 ( here @xmath37 is the scattering opacity and @xmath38 the density ) is used as the independent variable and the inner and outer boundaries are placed at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the variation of the height @xmath41 is obtained by differentiation .",
    "the radiation spectrum is computed from the first two moment equations for the monochromatic radiation energy density @xmath42 and flux @xmath43 , assuming that at the base of the atmosphere , where the @xmath44 , the radiation field is planckian .",
    "this set of coupled differential equations provides the run of pressure @xmath45 , temperature @xmath46 , height @xmath47 , radiation energy density @xmath42 and flux @xmath43 as functions of depth .",
    "the density is obtained from the perfect gas equation of state .",
    "a thorough discussion of the numerical method adopted to solve these equations can be found in nobili , turolla & zampieri @xcite .",
    "we note that the luminosity computed by the transfer code is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an `` effective spherical radius '' . assuming @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( equation [ [ lumring ] ] )",
    ", we obtain    @xmath52    the spectrum emitted by the whole disc is evaluated by summing up the contributions from the various rings    @xmath53    .model parameters.[tabmod ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a few comments on the assumptions involved in our treatment of the accretion flow and radiative transfer should be made .",
    "we decided to use the slim disc approximation even if we are aware that realistic discs are truly 2d structures in which all thermodynamic quantities vary with height and radius .",
    "modeling the 2d structure of accretion discs is much more complicated than using a 1d vertically averaged approximation .",
    "however , as recently discussed by hur & galliano @xcite , the accuracy of vertically averaged models should be sufficient in practice for many astrophysical applications . the slim disc model ( abramowicz et al .",
    "@xcite ) retains the assumption that the disc is geometrically thin but the centrifugal force no longer balances gravity exactly .",
    "the thickness of the disc depends on both pressure and viscosity : the higher is the pressure and ( in general ) the viscosity , the thicker is the disc . in going from extremely thin discs to thicker ones ,",
    "the effects of advection become progressively more important .",
    "the slim disc approach includes the effects of advection in a correct way while continuing to make use of vertical averaging .",
    "advection is particularly important for the inner parts of an accretion disc around a black hole : while a standard keplerian disc ends at the marginally stable orbit , a realistic accretion flow may continue inwards and must cross a sonic point before reaching the event horizon . finally , we note that gravity has been represented by the pseudo - newtonian potential of paczyski & wiita @xcite , which describes in a satisfactory way the dynamical effects of the schwarzschild gravitational potential .",
    "the main approximation that has been introduced in treating the vertical transfer of radiation in the disc concerns stationarity .",
    "this approximation turns out to be very good almost everywhere in the disc because the time - scale over which the radiation field changes is much shorter than the fastest dynamical time @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the sound , azimuthal and radial velocities . only in the transonic region of the disc",
    "this approximation might break down .",
    "however , the radial extent of this region is usually fairly small and does not contribute significantly to the total disc luminosity ( @xmath59 for the outburst state ) .",
    "the disc model used here neglects all the effects induced on the surface layers by the x - ray photons produced ( or scattered ) by an external medium .",
    "x - ray illumination by an external source heats the disc photosphere and leads to the formation of a highly ionized layer which can become thomson thick for large enough luminosities ( see e.g. nayakshin , kazanas & kallman @xcite ; nayakshin & kallman @xcite ) . while this will definitely influence the emitted spectrum shifting the emission at higher energies , its effect onto the hardening factor",
    "are more difficult to estimate and would require a consistent calculation .",
    "we only note that present results show that @xmath2 is not much sensitive to the disc surface temperature ( see table [ tabmod ] ) .",
