    "in recent years , the underlying mechanism of radiation - pressure forces has experimentally entangled the two distinct subjects of nanomechanical resonators and optical microcavities .",
    "there has been a great surge of interest in the field of cavity optomechanics with a wide variety of systems , such as gravitational wave detectors @xcite , nanomechanical cantilevers @xcite , membranes @xcite , vibrating microtoroids @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "the quantum optical properties of mirror interacting with the cavity field via radiation pressure exhibit interesting similarities to an intracavity kerr - like interaction @xcite .",
    "the optomechanical quantum ground state cooling of nano- and micro - mechanical oscillators is used in a large variety of sensitive measurements like detection of weak forces @xcite , small masses @xcite and small displacements @xcite .",
    "the dynamical instability of a driven cavity involving a movable mirror has been studied recently in the context of classical investigations of non - linear regimes @xcite .",
    "the coupled dynamics of atoms trapped within the optical cavity with movable mirror has also been studied @xcite .",
    "bec is considered as an ideal coherent system to illustrate the many - body quantum physics in a highly controllable manner .",
    "the breakthrough success of producing bec atoms @xcite has created a new interesting era of investigative study @xcite .",
    "it is made possible due to the largely improved cooling techniques @xcite .",
    "the coupling of an atom with the electromagnetic field can be controlled precisely in the field of quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , one can trap and cool the bec atoms experimentally within an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the methods to observe the properties of ultracold atoms in the field of quantum degenerate gases are based on the matter - wave destructive interference between atoms released from traps @xcite .",
    "the superfluid - mott insulator phase transition is governed by short - range interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the phase transition induced by long - range interaction is the creation of a self - organized phase from a bec in a high finesse optical cavity above a certain critical transverse optical pump intensity @xcite .",
    "the self - organization phenomenon has been investigated experimentally using a bec in an optical cavity in recent years @xcite .",
    "the spatial symmetry of the cavity optical lattice is spontaneously broken at the phase transition .",
    "in addition it was pointed out that this self organization transition is equivalent to the dicke quantum phase transition @xcite .    the dicke model @xcite describes the uniform interaction between the two - level atoms or spins with the light .",
    "the dicke model exhibits a continuous phase transition to a state with a non - vanishing photon population when the atom - light coupling exceeds a certain critical value . in order to review the dicke model and to study its applications in quantum optics ,",
    "@xcite .    motivated by these interesting developments in the field of cavity optomechanics and ultracold gases",
    ", we propose an optomechanical system consisting of an elongated cigar - shaped two - level bec interacting with a single mode of a high finesse optical cavity with one movable mirror .",
    "this optomechanical dicke model is used to study the semi - classical steady states to make an analysis of quantum phase transition ( self - organization process ) in the thermodynamic limit . for the generalized dicke model , a continuous phase transition",
    "is obtained on the basis of its semi - classical analysis , presented in refs .",
    "we also investigate the influence of cavity - mirror coupling on the self - organization of bec in the optomechanical cavity .",
    "we then further make a semi - classical steady state analysis of the influence of an external mechanical pump ( external foce on the vibrating mirror ) on the quantum phase transition .",
    "changing the mechanical pump frequency exhibits a shift in the critical atom - photon coupling strength which is needed to observe the dicke phase transition .",
    "we also show that this system can serve as a new quantum device to measure weak forces .",
    "finally , we discuss how the presence of mechanical pump alters the damping of bec confined within the optomechanical cavtiy .",
    "this is done by demonstrating the variation in condensate energy on changing the mechanical pump frequency for both the negative and positive cavity - laser detunings . here",
    ", we combine the use of an optical cavity with the movable mirror excited by an external source i.e. , a mechanical pump with the goal of producing colder condensates .",
    "in this section , we introduce and study the basic model for our system as shown in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the optomechanical system considered here essentially involves a fabry - perot optical cavity with one fixed mirror and another movable mirror of mass @xmath0 oscillating freely at mechanical frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we have in addition an elongated cigar shaped n two - level bec atoms , with mass @xmath2 and transition frequency @xmath3 .",
    "this atomic condensate is coupled to a single standing wave cavity mode of frequency @xmath4 and decay rate @xmath5 of a high - finesse optical cavity of length @xmath6 , and is driven by an external laser of frequency @xmath7 perpendicular to the cavity axis @xcite .",
    "we will consider the system dynamics in one dimension only i.e. , along the axis of cavity for simplicity .",
    "a tight harmonic potential of frequency @xmath8 freezes out the radial motion of the bec such that its spatial dimension along the cavity axis is taken into consideration only .",
    "we are assuming the atom - laser detuning @xmath9 to be very large such that the atomic spontaneous emission rate is negligible and the cavity photon loss will be the dominant dissipative process .",
    "the electronically excited atomic state can be adiabatically eliminated as it is justified for large detuning @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "an effective two - level atomic system with zero momentum state @xmath11 and excited momentum state @xmath12 is formed , where p being the momenta along the cavity axis and @xmath13 denotes the wave vector of the pump laser field @xcite .",
    "these states are coupled through a pair of distinct raman channels such that the effective transition frequency @xmath14 is twice the atomic recoil frequency @xmath15 . when all bec atoms with these different momentum states are coupled identically with the single - mode cavity field , the simplest model of such system is provided by the optomechanical dicke hamiltonian given as @xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the collective atomic operators satisfying angular momentum commutation relations @xmath20=2\\hat{j}_{z}$ ] and @xmath21=\\mp \\hat{j}_{\\pm}$ ] .",
    "they are expressed as @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 , where the index n labels the condensate atom .",
    "the collective atom - photon coupling strength is denoted by @xmath28 which can be experimentally tuned by varying the pump laser power @xcite .",
    "the cavity field operators @xmath29 represent the respective annihilation and creation operators following the commutation relation @xmath30=1 $ ] .",
    "the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the mechanical oscillator is denoted by @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33=1)$ ] .",
    "the contact interactions between the atoms of the condensate is neglected here .",
    "the several mechanical degrees of freedom arising from the radiation pressure are neglected by using a band - pass filter in the detection scheme such that only a single vibrational mode is considered @xcite .",
    "the optomechanical interaction between the cavity field and the oscillating mirror is due to the pressure exerted by the intra - cavity photons on the mirror . depending upon the number of photons in the cavity ,",
    "the light field exerts a force on the oscillating mirror which shifts the phase of the field by @xmath34 . here",
    ", @xmath35 represents the mirror displacement from its equilibrium position and @xmath36 denotes the propagation wave vector of the cavity field . the nonlinear dispersive coupling between the intensity of the cavity field and the position quadrature of the movable mirror is represented by @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     here @xmath39 .",
    "we now numerically examine the damping in bose - einstein condensate via the change in energy @xmath40 given by @xmath41 using mathematica 9.0 .",
    "we have @xmath42 if only @xmath43 initially .",
    "it is plotted against time in the absence of mechanical pump ( dashed line ) and for two different values of mechanical pump frequency with @xmath44 ( solid line ) and @xmath45 ( dot - dashed line ) ( shown in fig.(6 ) ) .",
    "it shows that the energy of the condensate initially increases and then decreases with time .",
    "fig.6(a ) shows the variation in energy of bec with time for negative detuning @xmath46 .",
    "it depicts an increase in the condensate energy with time in the presence of mechanical pump .",
    "fig.6(b ) represents the energy variation of bec with time for positive detuning @xmath47 .",
    "it shows the exactly opposite behaviour of bec to that for the case of negative detuning . there is a significant decrease in the condensate energy with increase in @xmath48 , thus damping the condensate .",
    "hence , the figure clearly illustrates that higher mechanical pump frequency enhances the damping of the condensate atoms , thereby , resulting in the cooling of condensate .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations can be individually targeted in the case of a finite temperature bec , resulting in the cooling of bec .",
    "this implies that the mechanical pump can alter the dynamics of the condensate atoms significantly .",
    "thus , by appropriately choosing the cavity - laser detuning and mechanical pump frequency , we have illustrated how they can in principle be used to produce extremely cold condensates . moreover , the change in condensate energy with time by varying the mechanical pump frequency shows a coherent energy exchange between the three modes ( i.e. , the condensate , cavity and mirror modes ) . in case of positive cavity - laser detuning , the decrease in energy of the condensate atoms with time by increasing the frequency of mechanical pump cleary depicts the energy transfer to the other two modes ( i.e. , the cavity and mirror modes ) ( see fig.6(b ) ) .",
    "this implies that , depending on whether the cavity - laser detuning is negative or positive , the coherent energy exchange between the three modes can be controlled by @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the influence of this external force on the mirror motion results in the shifting of bifurcation point and can simultaneously change the energy of bec atoms . however , note that the mechanical pump considered here should be chosen in such a way that the overall cooling rate must be higher than the resulting heating since some spontaneous emission is inevitable",
    ". the bec temperature can also be affected by the atomic spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the experimental parameters to demonstrate that the dynamics investigated here are within the experimental reach .",
    "the mechanical mode in an optomechanical system may have frequency varying from @xmath49hz @xcite , @xmath50khz @xcite , to @xmath51mhz @xcite .",
    "the corresponding damping rate of the movable mirror can be varied from @xmath52hz @xcite , @xmath53hz @xcite , to @xmath54khz @xcite .",
    "the intracavity field can have decay rate @xmath55 @xmath54mhz @xcite ( @xmath56mhz @xcite ) interacting with the cloud of bec that may have a coherent coupling strength of @xmath57mhz @xcite ( @xmath58mhz @xcite ) .",
    "this is significantly larger than the cavity damping rate @xmath5 , thus , placing the system firmly in a regime where the hamiltonian dynamics dominate .",
    "the mirror - photon coupling rate is @xmath59mhz .",
    "the loss of photons through the cavity mirrors can be minimized by using high - finesse optical cavities in order to have strong atom - field coupling .",
    "it could also be possible to realize the critical regime of the dicke model with just a few atoms in a regime of strong - coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the semi - classical steady states for the optomechanical dicke model in the thermodynamic limit , which demonstrate the existence of quantum phase transition ( onset of self - organization ) at the critical value of atom - photon coupling strength .",
    "we have also shown that the final phase of bec held within the optomechanical cavity becomes more organized by increasing the mirror - photon coupling .",
    "we further made a semi - classical steady state analysis of the influence of an external mechanical pump ( external force on the movable mirror ) on the quantum phase transition .",
    "we found a shift in the critical atom - cavity field coupling strength to a lower value in the presence of external mechanical pump .",
    "this system could also be used as a new quantum device in order to measure weak forces .",
    "in addition , we investigated the effect of an external mechanical pump on the damping of a bec confined in an optomechanical cavity via the energy . it is observed that , depending on cavity - laser detuning , the condensate energy can be increased or decreased with time by varying the mechanical pump frequency .",
    "the system also involves coherent energy exchange between the three different modes ( condensate , cavity and mirror modes ) , which can be controlled by mechanical pump frequency .",
    "thus , the external mechanical pump can be used as a new handle to change the critical phase transition point and to produce the extremely cold condensates .",
    "it provides a systematic control of the system by appropiately choosing the mechanical pump frequency .",
