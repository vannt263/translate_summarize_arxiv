    "from its first introduction in @xcite , the jones polynomial has played a decisive role in knot theory .",
    "this invariant associates to an oriented link @xmath7 a laurent polynomial @xmath8 .",
    "it is completely characterised by @xmath9 and a relation obtained from the kauffman bracket calculus : @xmath10 the two equations are for a positive and negative crossing , respectively . in the complement of the crossing under consideration , take the arc which ends at the top left corner of the crossing .",
    "then @xmath11 is the signed number of crossings between this arc and the other connected components of the complement ( this term compensates for the non - local change of orientation that occurs in one of the two ways of resolving the crossing ) .",
    "allows one to successively reduce the number of crossings , which in principle is suitable for algorithmic computation .",
    "however , despite arising in a farrago of contexts , the geometric meaning of the jones polynomial has remained somewhat mysterious .    in ( * ? ? ? * section 7 ) mikhail khovanov introduced a categorified jones polynomial , which is a bigraded abelian group @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13__unknot__@xmath14 is @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and zero otherwise .",
    "the role of equations is played by long exact sequences @xmath18 and @xmath19 starting from these , an obvious computation shows that the graded euler characteristic @xmath20 is , up to normalisation and change of variables , the jones polynomial : @xmath21 @xmath22 is known to be a strictly stronger invariant than @xmath23 @xcite ; by definition it remains algorithmically computable .",
    "the groups @xmath22 are only the starting point for a very rich theory .",
    "first of all , one can vary their definition in many ways , giving rise to potentially useful additional invariants , such as lee s spectral sequence @xcite .",
    "more spectacularly , they can be shown to fit into a topological quantum field theory for two - knots in four - space @xcite . very recently",
    ", rasmussen @xcite has used both properties to give a proof of milnor s conjecture on the slice genus of torus knots .",
    "this was previously accessible only via gauge theory ( instanton invariants @xcite originally , then seiberg - witten theory @xcite , and finally the ozsvth - szab rebirth of the latter in terms of pseudoholomorphic curves @xcite ) .",
    "rasmussen s argument is explicitly modelled on ozsvth - szab theory , and in fact he conjectures the equality of a certain numerical invariant obtained from @xmath22 and its geometric counterpart @xcite .",
    "this use of khovanov homology as a combinatorial substitute for gauge theory does not come as a complete surprise .",
    "the structural resemblance of the two theories , for instance looking at , versus floer s exact triangle , had been noticed for some time , and has found a concrete expression in the spectral sequence from @xcite , which goes from a variant of khovanov homology to the heegard floer homology of the branched double cover . in that picture , khovanov homology appears as a combinatorial approximation to heegard floer homology , and does not itself take on a geometric meaning .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper is different , in that we give a tentative symplectic geometry description of khovanov homology itself .",
    "the construction is fairly involved , but we can give a very rapid and superficial sketch at once : following jones and others , we present an oriented link @xmath24 as a closure of an @xmath25-stranded braid @xmath26 . adding another @xmath25 trivial strands gives @xmath27 , which can be represented as a loop @xmath5 in configuration space @xmath28 with respect to some base point @xmath29 .",
    "we introduce a @xmath30-dimensional noncompact symplectic manifold @xmath31 ( here and below , the more complicated notation is the one used in the body of the paper ) .",
    "this is the fibre at @xmath29 of a symplectic fibration over configuration space , whose monodromy along @xmath5 yields a symplectic automorphism @xmath32 .",
    "our @xmath33 also contains a canonical ( up to isotopy ) lagrangian submanifold @xmath34 diffeomorphic to @xmath35 .",
    "we apply lagrangian floer cohomology to these geometric data , and set @xmath36 where @xmath25 is as before , and @xmath37 is the writhe of the braid presentation ( the number of positive minus the number of negative crossings ) .",
    "[ th : main ] up to isomorphism of graded abelian groups , @xmath38 depends only on the oriented link @xmath24 , and not on its presentation as a braid closure .",
    "reversing the orientation of all components leaves @xmath39 unchanged , in particular we get an invariant of unoriented knots .",
    "the proposed relation with khovanov homology is that our invariant should be obtained from it by collapsing the bigrading ( actually , the sign of the @xmath40-grading should be reversed first , which is a simple change of conventions already applied in @xcite ) .",
    "[ th : conj ] @xmath41    we admit at once that , at least for the time being , the symplectic theory does not come with a bigrading corresponding to the one in @xmath22 .",
    "this prevents us from seeing the connection to the jones polynomial geometrically , since the euler characteristic only recovers the uninteresting specialization @xmath42 which counts components of the link .",
    "evidence for conjecture [ th : conj ] comes from various sources .",
    "the two sides have the same value for the unknot , and more generally they behave in the same way under adding an unlinked unknot component .",
    "another example is provided by the trefoil knot , whose @xmath43 we will compute by direct geometric means .",
    "more speculatively , a generalization of @xcite should yield the counterpart for @xmath43 of the long exact sequences , ( but",
    "there are many details still to be carried out ) .",
    "starting from this , one could follow the construction of the `` hypercubes of crossing resolutions '' of @xcite in @xmath43 and thereby obtain a spectral sequence which starts with @xmath44 and converges to @xmath43 ( this is precisely the approach used by ozsvth - szab @xcite ) .",
    "the conjectural vanishing of the higher order differentials in this sequence seems more difficult to explain at present , even though the fact that both theories are @xmath15-graded restricts the possibilities somewhat . a possible more fundamental explanation for conjecture [ th : conj ] would arise from a relation , on the derived level , between the fukaya categories of @xmath45 and differential graded modules over the arc algebras @xmath46 from @xcite .",
    "this was one of khovanov s motivations when he proposed that these particular manifolds should be relevant for understanding @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "because of its abstract homological algebra nature , this approach may seem far - fetched , but it has been successfully carried out in a toy model case @xcite .    after this rather tentative discussion , we return to the concrete geometry underlying the definition of @xmath43",
    ". the manifolds @xmath31 can be described in elementary terms ( as given by matrices of a certain special form , and with prescribed eigenvalues ) , but the proper framework for understanding them is provided by lie theory . for any semisimple",
    "complex lie algebra @xmath47 , one can consider the adjoint quotient map @xmath48 . in the case of @xmath49 , which is the one relevant to us here , this associates to each matrix its characteristic polynomial .",
    "thinking of @xmath50 as the set of unordered eigenvalues with multiplicities , we can identify an open dense subset @xmath51 with the space @xmath52 of configurations having zero center of mass , and the restriction of @xmath53 to that subspace is a differentiable fibre bundle .",
    "we actually want to restrict @xmath53 to a so - called transverse slice , which is an affine subspace of @xmath47 intersecting all orbits of the natural adjoint @xmath54-action transversally .",
    "there is a well - known general construction of such slices @xmath55 , which starts with a nilpotent element of @xmath47 and invokes the jacobson - morozov theorem .",
    "the restrictions @xmath56 are still differentiable fibre bundles over the subset @xmath51 , and their topological monodromy has been used by slodowy @xcite and others to give an alternative construction of springer s weyl group representations . for our particular slices",
    "@xmath1 , we take the nilpotent @xmath57 which has two jordan blocks of size @xmath25 , and use a slight generalization of the jacobson - morozov construction ( this is purely for technical reasons : @xmath1 is isomorphic to the corresponding jacobson - morozov slice @xmath58 , but is slightly easier to use ) .",
    "the fibre of @xmath59 at the point @xmath29 ( translated by a constant to put it into @xmath52 , to be precise ) is our @xmath4 .",
    "crucially , if we take a point @xmath60 where two eigenvalues come together , the fibre of @xmath59 over @xmath61 has a fibered @xmath62 singularity . by this",
    "we mean that the stratum of singular points is itself smooth , and that the normal structure of this stratum is that of an ordinary double point singularity @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , up to symplectic isomorphism the singular stratum itself can be identified with a regular fibre of @xmath64 .",
    "this leads to an inductive scheme , where we construct lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath4 by bringing the eigenvalues together in successive pairs .",
    "more precisely , each `` crossingless matching '' @xmath65 of the configuration @xmath29 in the plane gives rise to a lagrangian submanifold @xmath66 , and the @xmath67 which appeared above is just the example obtained from a certain standard choice of matching . to prove theorem [ th : main",
    "] one needs to check the invariance of our symplectic floer cohomology group under the markov moves which relate different braid presentations of the same link . for the most difficult ( because it changes the number @xmath25 of strands ) type ii move this will follow from the observation that if @xmath61 is a point where three eigenvalues are brought together , the fibre of @xmath59 at that point has a fibered @xmath68 type singularity .",
    "the main lesson to be learnt from this is that the data which enter into the definition of @xmath43 , and the properties which make it an oriented link invariant , are all derived from the basic geometry of the adjoint quotient , and general facts from symplectic geometry . to emphasize that",
    ", the paper alternates sections of general exposition with others more specifically tailored to our needs .    alternatively , one can think of @xmath4 as a space of solutions of nahm s equations with certain boundary data ( these are basically the equations for @xmath69-invariant instantons on @xmath70 , with gauge group @xmath71 , cf .",

    "* theorem 8.4 ) ( strictly this is partly conjectural , since the cited work does not quite cover our case ) .",
    "these descriptions show geometric properties of @xmath4 which may not be immediately apparent from the point of view taken here , and lead to several possible avenues for further development ( other than the obvious question of trying to prove conjecture [ th : conj ] ) .",
    "for instance , there is an involution on @xmath4 whose fixed point set is related to the jacobian of the double cover of @xmath72 branched along the configuration of points @xmath73 , and that leads to a geometric interpretation of the relation between khovanov and ozsvth - szab theory .",

    "let @xmath959 be a path in @xmath956 representing @xmath1089 , and similarly @xmath1171 paths in @xmath28 representing @xmath1172 .",
    "then there are isomorphisms of graded abelian groups ,",
    "@xmath1173 @xmath149    inspection of shows that these precisely cancel out against the changes in @xmath1174 .",
    "this proves the invariance under markov @xmath1175 of @xmath39 as a graded group , and thereby completes our proof of theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "complex conjugation @xmath1176 acts on @xmath1 , and induces the obvious map , also denoted by @xmath476 , on the base of the adjoint quotient map @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1177 consists of real eigenvalues , like our base point @xmath29 , we have an induced involution of @xmath907 which reverses the sign of the khler form . as an obvious consequence of its behaviour on @xmath50 , and the definition of parallel transport and of the lagrangian submanifolds associated to crossingless matchings",
    ", we have @xmath1178 in particular , since @xmath1179 , our basic lagrangian submanifold @xmath1180 is invariant under this involution up to isotopy .",
    "since @xmath476 is antisymplectic , it induces isomorphisms on floer cohomology groups which exchange the two factors involved , @xmath1181 a choice of grading for @xmath1182 induces a grading for @xmath1183 , and with that in mind becomes an isomorphism of graded groups .",
    "this is just the fact that complex conjugation acts on the first cohomology of the grassmannian of lagrangian subspaces in a symplectic vector space by multiplication by @xmath1184 ; suitably unwound ( and coupled with the definition of the absolute grading @xcite ) , this implies that @xmath1185 ) = ( c(l_k))[1]$ ] , in other words increasing the absolute maslov index of an intersection point of the @xmath1182 decreases the index of the point viewed as an intersection of the @xmath1183 . by combining this with and symplectomorphism invariance of floer cohomology , one finds that @xmath1186 if @xmath5 represents @xmath1036 for some @xmath26 , then @xmath1187 represents @xmath1188 , where the braid @xmath1189 is obtained from @xmath475 by the antiautomorphism of @xmath1046 which inverts the order of the letters in a word with respect to the standard presentation . if @xmath475 gives a braid presentation for an oriented link @xmath24 , then @xmath1189 corresponds to the same link with the orientation of all components reversed .",
    "since both presentations have the same number of strands and the same writhe , the computation above shows :        we now look at the left - handed trefoil knot @xmath24 ( more precisely , the knot coming from the braid closure with @xmath1191 ) . the first part of the proof is to reduce things to an open subset of @xmath1192 where one has nice holomorphic coordinates , and then deform the khler form to a more standard one .",
    "this runs entirely parallel to the corresponding argument for markov @xmath1175 , so we will omit it and simply state the outcome .    let @xmath1193 be the quadric @xmath1194 for some @xmath1152 .",
    "choose some @xmath1195 , and consider the line bundle @xmath715 whose fibre is the @xmath1196-eigenspace of the matrix @xmath1197 inside @xmath1198 with fibre coordinates @xmath584 , consider the sub - fibre bundle @xmath499 defined by @xmath1199 for some small @xmath704 , and where @xmath669 is as in section [ sec : symplectic][subsec : a2 ] .",
    "we construct a khler form on @xmath499 ( or more precisely on an open subset which is sufficiently large for our purpose ) by combining the standard form on the base and fibre , and a hermitian metric on @xmath733 , as set out in background [ th : background ] .",

    "the paths @xmath706 and @xmath714 intersect in one endpoint and one interior point , and the corresponding intersections of @xmath711 and @xmath1205 consist of a single point and a circle respectively .",
    "this takes place in each fibre over @xmath1206 , leading to a total intersection which is the disjoint union of a copy of the @xmath569 and a circle bundle over it .",
