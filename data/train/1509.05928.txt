    "the theory of _ decay characters _ was first introduced by c.  bjorland and m.e .",
    "schonbek in  @xcite and further developped by c.  niche and m.e .",
    "schonbek in  @xcite , with the motivation of obtaining sharp upper and lower bound estimates for the @xmath6-norm of solutions to a large class of linear or semilinear parabolic systems : so far , this theory has been successfully applied , _",
    "e.g. _ , to the heat equation , the navier ",
    "stokes equations @xcite , the quasi - geostrophic equations  @xcite , several compressible approximations of navier  stokes  @xcite and to the navier  stokes  voigt equation  @xcite .",
    "the first issue of the present paper is that a slight modification of the original definition of _ decay character _ makes the theory more powerful and more widely applicable : our modification allows in particular to get _ necessary and sufficient _ conditions on  @xmath3 for the validity of @xmath6-estimates of the form @xmath7 ( where @xmath5 is a suitable linear pseudo - differential operator , such as the laplacian , a fractional laplacian , etc . ) , whereas the original approach @xcite only gave _ sufficient _ conditions on  @xmath3 for the validity of  .",
    "we also characterize the class of initial data  @xmath3 such that estimates   hold in terms of suitable subsets of besov spaces .",
    "applications of our analysis to nonlinear problems include the complete characterization of divergence - free vector fields  @xmath8 such that the corresponding weak solutions of the navier  stokes equations satisfy two - side bounds for the energy of the form @xmath9 one of our main results , theorem  [ th:4equiv ] , will provide three different equivalent conditions on  @xmath10 for the vality of  .",
    "our characterization does not go through when @xmath11 , because the lower bound of the nonlinear problem in this borderline case is no longer driven by the corresponding lower bound for heat kernel .",
    "the other important results of this paper will be summarized by eq .   in the last section .",
    "we will often use the symbols @xmath12 or @xmath13 in chain of inequalities to avoid the proliferation of different constants .",
    "for example , writing @xmath14",
    "we mean that @xmath15 for some constant @xmath16 independent on  @xmath17 .",
    "when we have both @xmath14 and @xmath18 we will often write @xmath19 .",
    "the authors in @xcite introduced the notion of  _ decay indicator_. as the original definition looks somewhat too restrictive , we redefine it in the following way :    let @xmath20 .",
    "the _ lower and upper decay indicators _ of @xmath3 are the two lower and upper limits @xmath21 when @xmath22 , then we can define the _ decay indicator _ of  @xmath3 as @xmath23 .",
    "this definition is interesting only for @xmath24 , as the decay indicator is always zero when @xmath25 .",
    "originally , the decay indicator was defined in @xcite as the limit @xmath26 implicitly assuming that the limit does exist .",
    "but this is not always the case for @xmath0 .",
    "when the above limit does not exist , the lower and upper decay indicators are convenient substitutes for obtaining some relevant estimates , as we will see below .",
    "of course , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are always well defined in @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "an example of @xmath30 such that @xmath31 is not well defined by the limit   can be constructed putting fast oscillations for @xmath32 near the origin .",
    "see the following example  [ ex : v0 ] .    on the other hand , if @xmath0 is such that @xmath33 as @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , then @xmath36 and so @xmath37 is well defined in this case and @xmath38 as well .",
    "the _ upper and lower decay characters _ of  @xmath0 are respectively defined by @xmath39    for any @xmath0 , the upper and lower decay characters are always well defined ( adopting the usual convention that @xmath40 ) and satisfy the inequality @xmath41 indeed , for all @xmath25 , we have @xmath42 , so the first inequality is immediate . let us now prove the inequality in the middle of  . if , by contradiction , @xmath43 , then we could choose two real numbers @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "but the last inequality implies @xmath47 . on the other hand , @xmath48 , that contredics the inequality @xmath45 .",
    "the upper decay character @xmath49 will play a role in obtaining decay estimates from above for @xmath50 , and the lower decay character @xmath49 will be useful for obtaining estimates from below .",
    "this is the reason of our terminology .",
    "depending on @xmath0 , the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 in the definition of @xmath49 and @xmath53 can be achieved or not .",
    "this observation motivates next definition .",
    "our definition below is an improvement of that of  @xcite .",
    "[ def : dc ] if @xmath0 is such that there exists @xmath54 such that @xmath55 then we call this number @xmath56 the _ decay character _ of @xmath3 .",
    "we define also the decay character of @xmath3 in the two limit situations as follows : @xmath57    [ rem : exist ] for @xmath0 the decay character @xmath58 does not always exist .",
    "one reason for this is that it can happen that @xmath59 .",
    "see example  [ ex : w0 ] .",
    "another reason is that one could have @xmath60 , but the supremum or the infimum appearing in the definition of @xmath49 and @xmath53 are nor achieved .",
    "see example  [ ex : u0 ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath58 does exist and belongs to @xmath61 if and only if there exists @xmath54 such that @xmath62 . the `` only if '' part of this claim is clear .",
    "the `` if '' part holds because , if @xmath63 then @xmath64 ( otherwise we would get the contradiction @xmath65 , as already observed right after  ) and so @xmath66 . in the same way one sees that @xmath67 .",
    "let us illustrate the difference between our improved definition of decay character and the original definition in  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of such an improvement is the validity of the second assertion of theorem  [ th : bs ] below .",
    "our discussion concerns here only the case @xmath68 , but it could be adapted also to the limit situations @xmath69  or   @xmath70 .    originally , the decay character @xmath58 was defined in @xcite implicitly assuming that , for all  @xmath71 , @xmath72 and also assuming that , for some @xmath54 , @xmath73 . under such two conditions , we see that @xmath74 .",
    "for this reason , if @xmath3 admits a decay character in the sense of  @xcite then @xmath3 admits a decay character in the sense of our definition and these are the same .",
    "the converse is not true , so the original definition in @xcite is indeed more restrictive than ours : for example , the function  @xmath30 , constructed in example  [ ex : v0 ] admits a decay character _ only _ in the sense of our definition .",
    "we start with an application of the notions of upper and lower decay indicators . as in  @xcite , we consider the class of ( matricial ) pseudo - differential operators  @xmath5 with symbol @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively diagonal and orthogonal matrices of order  @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , for all @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath83 are homogeneous functions smooth outside @xmath84 .",
    "we are interested in establishing @xmath6-estimates from above and below for solutions of the linear problem @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "basic examples include the heat equation @xmath88 ( in this case @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) or the evolution problem for the fractional laplacian ( @xmath89 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "examples of physical interest with @xmath92 arise , _",
    "e.g. _ , in fluid mechanics , see  @xcite .",
    "we will typically assume @xmath93 . however , from now on we will not distinguish in our notations between scalar and vector - valued function spaces and write abusively @xmath0 also in the vector - valued case .    [",
    "prop : ulb ] let @xmath0 , let @xmath94 be a pseudo - differential operator as above .",
    "let @xmath95 be the solution of the linear problem  .    * if @xmath45 then there is a constant @xmath96 such that , for all @xmath97 , @xmath98 * if @xmath99 , then there is a constant @xmath100 such that , for all @xmath97 , @xmath101    the proof below is a minor modification to that of  @xcite*theorem  5.7 ( for the particular case @xmath102 ) or that of  @xcite*theorem  2.10 ( for the general case ) .",
    "we have @xmath103 hence , for any function @xmath104 , @xmath105 let @xmath106 . under the assumption of the first assertion and by the definition of @xmath107 , we have @xmath108}\\phi_r(\\rho)$ ] .",
    "hence , for some @xmath109 and all @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 .",
    "the choice @xmath112 then leads to @xmath113 and the first claim follows .",
    "let us prove the second assertion , following again the steps of  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the assumption on the symbol @xmath114 allows us to write @xmath115 this insures the validity of the energy inequality @xmath116 the classical fourier splitting idea @xcite is then used to deduce the estimate @xmath117 our assumption now reads @xmath118}\\phi_r(\\rho)<\\infty$ ] .",
    "it implies that for some @xmath119 and all @xmath110 , we have @xmath120 .",
    "hence , @xmath121 combining the two last estimates , choosing now @xmath122 with @xmath123 , and multiplying by the integrating factor @xmath124 we arrive at @xmath125 the upper bound follows by integration .",

    "this first assertion is an immediate consequence of the estimates obtained in proposition  [ prop : ulb ] . on the other hand , the validity of assertion   is made possible by the fact that , compared to  @xcite , in our definition we relaxed a little bit the requirements for the existence of the decay character .",
    "the proof of the converse part of theorem  [ th : bs ] will be postponed in remark  [ re : pro ] , after the characterization of decay characters in terms of subsets of besov spaces .",

    "the equivalence is just a reformulation of proposition  [ prop:3crit ] . indeed , as explained in  remark  [ rem : exist ] , the decay character @xmath58 does exist and belongs to @xmath61 if and only if there exists @xmath54 such that @xmath62 .    the equivalence was established in theorem  [ th : cara ] .",
    "the implication relies on classical wiegner s theorem  @xcite : in the 3d case and in the absence of external forces , the theorem in  @xcite can restated as follows : if @xmath0 is a divergence - free vector field such that @xmath364 , and if @xmath95 is a weak solution of ( ns ) as above , then the difference @xmath365 satisfies the decay estimates @xmath366 notice in particular that , for @xmath362 , one gets @xmath367 as @xmath368 .",
