    "in @xcite , one of the authors of this paper together with h.  cornean and p.  zi discussed a number of conjectures about the _ excitation spectrum _ of the interacting bose gas at zero temperature with repulsive potentials in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in particular , @xcite conjectured that such systems have a quasiparticle - like excitation spectrum without an energy gap and with a positive critical velocity .",
    "these conjectures seem to be consistent with experimental data .",
    "in particular , they explain various phenomena related to the _ superfluidity_.    in this paper we would like to sketch a number of analogous conjectures about the interacting fermi gas at zero temperature with an attractive interaction in thermdynamic limit .",
    "we will argue that these systems should possess a quasiparticle - like excitation spectrum with a positive energy gap and a positive critical velocity .",
    "this conjecture implies in particular that the ground state energy is separated from the rest of the spectrum . in some situations ,",
    "this ground state can be interpreted as a _ current carrying state _ , and plays an important role in the phenomenon of _",
    "superconductivity_.    the most robust quantity related to the excitation spectrum seems to be its infimum .",
    "therefore , our main conjectures involve the infimum of the excitation spectrum ( separately in the even and odd sector ) .",
    "they are based on the _ grand - canonical hamiltonian _ for a fixed _ chemical potential_.    however , to have full information about the excitation spectrum , it is not enough to know its infimum .",
    "in fact , the hfb approximation suggests that the excitation spectrum of the fermi gas has `` lacunas '' near its bottom .",
    "we make an attempt to express some conjectures about these lacunas .",
    "these conjectures are more complicated to state , probably also more delicate , and involve the _ canonical hamiltonian _ , ( that is , for a fixed number of particles ) .",
    "we do not prove our conjectures .",
    "however , we introduce a rather general class of model hamiltonians for which these conjectures can be tested and , maybe , proven under some assumptions .",
    "these hamiltonians consist of a two - body kinetic energy , not necessarily quadratic , and an interaction .",
    "the interaction does not have to be local ( given by a local potential ) .",
    "we also suppose that our system has `` internal degrees of freedom '' ( eg .",
    "`` spin '' ) .",
    "it seems important to assume that the interaction is in some sense `` attractive '' , which means some kind of negative definiteness .",
    "this is suggested by the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method .",
    "we include in our paper short computations based on the hfb approach .",
    "the basic principle of these computations is well known , but in the literature they are usually presented in simple special cases .",
    "our presentation applies to a rather general case . as a result of the hfb approach we obtain an approximate quasiparticle representation of our hamiltonian with a dispersion relation possessing very special features : a positive energy gap and a positive critical velocity .",
    "we conjecture that this dispersion relation suggests basic qualitative features of the true excitation spectrum of interacting fermi gas in thermodynamic limit .",
    "there exist many papers that study the energy spectrum of interacting fermi and bose systems .",
    "in particular , there exist interesting works that study the hbf approximation in such systems .",
    "what makes our paper different is the role of translation invariance .",
    "this enables us to ask questions about the excitation spectrum , which we expect to have interesting properties .",
    "many papers attempt to show that models based on quasiparticles give some kind of an approximation to realistic hamiltonians , see eg .",
    "however , only relatively crude features are considered in essentially all these papers . typically , they study the energy or the free energy per volume in thermodynamic limit .",
    "we are interested in the excitation spectrum , which is a finer quantity and does not involve dividing by the large volume . the only rigorous result that we know devoted to the excitation spectrum of an interacting quantum gas is due to r.  seiringer @xcite .",
    "it concerns the bose gas in finite volume and a mean field limit .",
    "we always assume that the interaction is translation invariant .",
    "in realistic physical systems translation invariance is at most approximate .",
    "superconducting materials are perhaps the closest to idealized translation invariant models that we consider . nevertheless , we believe that the picture presented in our paper is physically relevant also in many fermi systems that are quite far from being translationally invariant , such as quantum dots and nuclei .",
    "in fact , one can argue that `` traces '' of translational degrees of freedom are present also in these systems , disguised as rotations and vibrations .",
    "in particular , the energy spectra of their odd and even sectors have various features consistent with our conjectures , see @xcite for quantum dots and @xcite sect . 6.1 for nuclei .",
    "the immediate motivation of our paper is to state mathematically interesting rigorous conjectures together with heuristic arguments in their favor .",
    "therefore , we do not strive at all costs to describe realistic concrete physical systems .",
    "the assumption of translation invariance helps to formulate a clean and rigorous definition of various concepts .    * acknowledgement * the research of j.d . and",
    "m.n was supported in part by the national science center ( ncn ) grant no .",
    "2011/01/b / st1/04929 .",
    "the work of m.n . was also supported by the foundation for polish science international phd projects programme co - financed by the eu european regional development fund .",
    "the concept of `` quasiparticle '' , although often used , seems to have no satisfactory definition in the literature . in this section",
    "we attempt to give a number of rigorous interpretations of this term",
    ". we will also discuss spectral properties of quantum systems that can be described in terms of quasiparticles .",
    "the discussion of this section will be rather general and abstract . to a large extent",
    "it will be independent of the rest of the paper .",
    "the main object of interest of this paper are translation invariant quantum systems in _",
    "thermodynamic limit_. there are at least two approaches that can be used to describe such systems .    in the first approach one",
    "starts with a construction of a system in finite volume , using @xmath0^d$ ] , the @xmath1-dimensional cubic box of side length @xmath2 , as the configuration space .",
    "it is convenient , although somewhat unphysical , to impose the periodic boundary conditions , the system is described by its hilbert space @xmath3 , hamiltonian @xmath4 and momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the spectrum of the momentum is discrete and coincides with @xmath6 . after computing appropriate quantities ( such as the infimum of the excitation spectrum )",
    "one tries to take the limit @xmath7 .",
    "sometimes a different approach is possible .",
    "one can try to construct a hilbert space @xmath8 , a hamiltonian @xmath9 and a momentum @xmath10 that describe the system on @xmath11 .",
    "this may be not easy .",
    "it may require the use of refined techniques @xcite .",
    "it is probably not always possible .",
    "note that in this case the spectrum of the momentum is expected to be absolutely continuous , with the exception of the ground state .",
    "the latter approach seems conceptually more elegant . throughout most of this section",
    "we will adopt it . in most situations",
    "this will allow us to formulate some of the physical concepts in a concise manner .",
    "( sometimes , however , it will lead to technical complications ) .    in the next two sections we adopt the former approach , which is more down - to - earth .",
    "thus only a family @xmath12 for finite @xmath2 will be defined .    to sum up",
    ", throughout most of this section by a _ translation invariant quantum system _ we will mean @xmath13 commuting self - adjoint operators @xmath14 on a hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 has the interpretation of a _ hamiltonian _ and @xmath15 describes the _ momentum_.      the joint spectrum of the operators @xmath16 ( which is a subset of @xmath17 ) will be denoted by @xmath18 and called the _ energy - momentum spectrum of @xmath16_.    we will often assume that @xmath9 is bounded from below .",
    "if it is the case , we can define the _ ground state energy _ as @xmath19 .",
    "we will also often assume that @xmath9 possesses translation invariant ground state @xmath20 , which is a unique joint eigenvector of @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    under these assumptions , by subtracting the ground state energy from the energy - momentum spectrum",
    "we obtain the _ excitation spectrum of @xmath16 _ , that is , @xmath24 .",
    "we can also introduce the _ strict excitation spectrum _ as the joint spectrum of restriction of @xmath25 to the orthogonal complement of @xmath20 : @xmath26 thus if @xmath27 is an isolated simple eigenvalue of @xmath16 , then @xmath28 otherwise @xmath29 .",
    "we introduce also a special notation for the infimum of @xmath30 : @xmath31    the following two parameters have interesting physical implications .",
    "the first is the _ energy gap _ , defined as @xmath32 another quantity of physical interest is the _ critical velocity _ : @xmath33    physical properties of a system are especially interesting if the energy gap @xmath34 is strictly positive . in such a case , the ground state energy is separated from the rest of the energy spectrum , and hence the ground state is _",
    "stable_.    positive critical velocity is also very interesting .",
    "physically , a positive critical velocity is closely related to the phenomenon of _ superfluidity _ , see eg . a discussion in @xcite .",
    "one expects that most of a typical excitation spectrum is absolutely continuous wrt .",
    "the lebesgue measure on @xmath35 .",
    "however , it may also contain isolated shells continuously depending on the momentum . in this subsection",
    "we attempt to define the part of the excitation spectrum that corresponds to such a situation .    note that this is not easy in the abstract framework that we adopted in this section . actually , in the next section , based on finite volume systems @xmath12",
    ", we will use a different approach to define isolated shells , see subsect [ excited quasiparticle shells ] .",
    "we say that @xmath36 belongs to @xmath37 , called the _ discrete excitation spectrum _ , if there exists @xmath38 such that the operator @xmath10 has an absolutely continuous spectrum of uniformly finite multiplicity when restricted to @xmath39 the _ essential excitation spectrum _ is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "( we use an obvious notation for spectral projections of self - adjoint operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 : eg .",
    "@xmath41 denotes the spectral projection of @xmath9 onto @xmath42e-\\delta , e+\\delta[$ ] ) .",
    "we introduce also a special notation for the bottom of @xmath43 : @xmath44    obviously , @xmath45",
    "@xmath46    note that typically @xmath37 consists of a finite number of shells separated by lacunas .",
    "abstract theory allows us to represent the hilbert space @xmath8 as the direct integral over @xmath11 given by the spectral decomposition of @xmath10 , see eg .",
    "@xcite , 4.4.1 .",
    "suppose , in addition , that this direct integral can be taken with respect to the lebesgue measure , so that we can write @xmath47 then it is tempting to claim that @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the essential spectrum and the subscript @xmath50 denots the closure .",
    "unfortunately , at this level of generality there is a problem with ( [ pw1 ] ) and ( [ pw2 ] ) .",
    "first of all , there is no guarantee that we can put the lebesgue measure in ( [ pw0 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the direct integral representation ( [ pw0 ] ) is not defined uniquely , but only modulo sets of measure zero .    in concrete situations , however , ( such as quasiparticle systems considered in sect .",
    "[ concept of a quasiparticle ] ) the direct integral ( [ pw0 ] ) has an obvious distinguished realization involving the lebesgue measure , for which the identities ( [ pw1 ] ) and ( [ pw2 ] ) are actually true .",
    "many important translation invariant quantum systems can be described in terms of _ quasiparticles _ , that is , independent bosonic or fermionic modes with appropriately chosen _ dispersion relations _ ( the dependence of the quasiparticle energy on the momentum ) .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "for a hilbert space @xmath51 , the notation @xmath52 , resp .",
    "@xmath53 will stand for the _ bosonic _ , resp .",
    "_ fermionic fock space _ with the _ one particle space _ @xmath51 . by a _",
    "quasiparticle quantum system _ we will mean @xmath54 , where @xmath55 for some intervals @xmath56 , real continuous functions @xmath57 , and _ creation _ , resp .",
    "_ annihilation operators _ @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is called the set of _ quasiparticle species _ and it is partitioned into @xmath61 and @xmath62  bosonic and fermionic quasiparticles .    we are using the standard notation of the formalism of 2nd quantization : @xmath58 and @xmath59 satisfy the usual commutation / anticommutation relations .",
    "they are not true operators , only formal symbols , however the right hand sides of ( [ quasa1 ] ) and ( [ quasa2 ] ) are well defined as operators on the fock space @xmath63    for @xmath64 , the set @xmath65 describes the allowed range of the momentum of a single @xmath66th quasiparticle and @xmath67 is its energy ( dispersion relation ) for momentum @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath65 can be strictly smaller than @xmath11  some quasiparticles may exist only for some momenta .",
    "this allows us more flexibility and is consistent with applications to condensed matter physics",
    ". it will be convenient to define @xmath69 ( the set of quasiparticles that may have momentum @xmath68 ) .",
    "clearly , if we know the dispersion relations @xmath70 , @xmath64 , then we can determine the energy - momentum spectrum of @xmath54 : @xmath71 note that there is an obvious direct integral representation of the form ( [ pw0 ] ) and the relations ( [ pw1 ] ) and ( [ pw2 ] ) hold .",
    "let @xmath16 be a quasiparticle system .",
    "the energy - momentum spectrum of such systems has special properties .",
    "first , we have @xmath72 because of the fock vacuum state , which is a unique joint eigenstate of @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we have a remarkable addition property @xmath73    assume now that the hamiltonian ( [ quasa1 ] ) is bounded from below , or what is equivalent , assume that all the dispersion relations are non - negative . then the fock vacuum is a ground state satisfying @xmath74 , so that the excitation spectrum coincides with the energy - momentum spectrum . thus we can rewrite ( [ endeq0- ] ) and ( [ endeq1- ] ) as @xmath75    given ( [ endeq0 ] ) , ( [ endeq1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath76    another remarkable property holds true if in addition the number of particle species is finite .",
    "we have then @xmath77 indeed , using the continuity of the momentum spectrum , we easily see that only 1-particle states can belong to the disrete spectrum of the fiber hamiltonians @xmath78 .",
    "before we proceed , let us introduce some terminology concerning real functions that will be useful in our study of quasiparticle - like spectra . recall that a function @xmath79 is called _ subadditive _ if @xmath80    let @xmath81 be a given function .",
    "define @xmath82 ( by definition , the infimum of an empty set is @xmath83 ) .",
    "@xmath84 is known under the name of the _ subadditive hull of @xmath85_. equivalently , @xmath84 is the biggest subadditive function less than @xmath85 .",
    "note the relation @xmath86    let us go back to a quasiparticle system ( [ quasa1 ] ) , ( [ quasa2 ] ) with nonnegative dispersion relations . for @xmath68",
    ", define @xmath87 recall the functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 and the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath90 that we defined in subsects [ excitation spectrum ] and [ essential excitation spectrum ] .    1 .",
    "the bottom of the strict excitation spectrum is the subadditive hull of @xmath91 : @xmath92 2 .",
    "the energy gap satisfies @xmath93 3 .",
    "the critical velocity satisfies @xmath94 4 .",
    "if in addition the number of quasiparticle species is finite , then @xmath95    note that we assume that the momentum space is @xmath11 .",
    "if we replace the momentum space @xmath11 with @xmath6 ( that is , if we put our system on a torus of side length @xmath2 ) and we assume that all quasiparticles are bosonic , then all statements of this subsection generalize in an obvious way .",
    "however , because of the pauli principle , not all of them generalize in the fermionic case .",
    "one often considers quantum systems of the form @xmath96 where @xmath54 is a quasiparticle system and the perturbation @xmath97 is in some sense small .",
    "a description of physical systems in terms of approximate quasiparticles is very common in condensed matter physics .",
    "in particular , it appears naturally in the context of the so - called hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation , where one tries to optimize a quasiparticle description for a given quantum system @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is a considerable freedom in choosing the splitting of @xmath9 into @xmath98 and @xmath97 , and so quasiparticles of this kind are only vaguely determined .",
    "we will argue that in some cases a different concept of quasiparticles is useful , which is rigorous and in a way much more interesting .",
    "this concept is expressed in the following definition .",
    "let @xmath16 be a translation invariant system on a hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "we will say that it is a _ quasiparticle - like system _ if it is unitarily equivalent to a quasiparticle system .",
    "the above definition has one drawback . in practice",
    "we expect that the unitary equivalence mentioned in this definition is in some sense _ natural _ and constructed in the framework of _ scattering theory_.    scattering theory is quite far from the main subject of this paper , which is mostly concerned with purely spectral questions",
    ". however , since it has been mentioned and is very closely related to the concept of a quasiparticle , let us give a brief discussion of this topic .    for a number of many body systems the basic idea of scattering theory can be described as follows . using the evolution @xmath99 for @xmath100 ,",
    "we define two isometric operators @xmath101 @xmath102 are called the _ wave _ or _ mller operators _ and they satisfy @xmath103 where @xmath54 is a quasiparticle system .",
    "@xmath104 is then called the _ scattering operator_.    we will say that the system is _ asymptotically complete _ if the wave operators @xmath102 are unitary . clearly , if a system is asymptotically complete , then it is quasiparticle - like .",
    "there are at least two classes of important physical system which possess a natural and rigorous scattering theory of this kind .",
    "the first class consists of the 2nd quantization of schrdinger many body operators with 2-body short range interactions @xcite . one can show that these systems are asymptotically complete ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this case",
    "the system is invariant wrt .",
    "galileian group _ and the dispersion relations have the form @xmath105 .",
    "quasiparticles obtained in this context can be `` elementary ''  in applications to physics these are typically electrons and nuclei  as well as `` composite ''  atoms , ions , molecules , etc .    another important class of systems where the concept of asymptotic quasiparticles has a rigorous foundation belongs to ( relativistic ) quantum field teory , as axiomatized by the haag - kastler or wightman axioms .",
    "if we assume the existence of discrete mass shells , the so - called _ haag - ruelle theory _ allows us to construct the wave operators , see eg .",
    "note that in this case the system is covariant wrt . the _ poincar group _ and the dispersion relation has the form @xmath106 .",
    "here , quasiparticles are the usual stable particles .",
    "let us stress that both classes of systems can be interacting in spite of the fact that they are equivalent to free quasiparticle systems",
    ". in particular , their scattering operator can be nontrivial .",
    "the above described classes of quantum systems are quite special .",
    "they are covariant wrt .",
    "rather large groups ( galilei or poincar ) and have quite special dispersion relations .",
    "the concept of a quasiparticle is useful also in other contexts , without the galilei or poincar covariance .",
    "an interesting system which admits a quasiparticle interpretation is the free fermi gas with a positive chemical potential .",
    "we describe this system in subsect .",
    "[ non - interacting fermi gas ] . in this case",
    "the scattering theory is trivial : @xmath107 , and hence @xmath108 .",
    "it seems that condensed matter physicists apply successfully the concept of a quasiparticle also to various interacting translation invariant systems .",
    "one class of such systems seems to be the bose gas with repulsive interactions at zero temperature and positive density . in this case , apparently , the system is typically well described by a free bose gas of quasiparticles of ( at least ) two kinds : at low momenta we have _ phonons _ with an approximately linear dispersion relation , and at somewhat higher momenta we have _",
    "rotons_. this idea underlies the famous _",
    "bogoliubov approximation _",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of _ superfluidity _ can be to a large extent explained within this picture .",
    "the model of free asymptotic phonons seems to work well in real experiments @xcite .",
    "another class of strongly interacting systems that seems to be successfully modelled by independent quasiparticles is the fermi gas with attractive interactions at zero temperature and positive chemical potential . by using the _ hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach _",
    "@xcite , which is closely related to the original _ bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approximation _",
    "@xcite , one obtains a simple model that can be used to explain the _ superconductivity _ of the fermi gas at very low temperatures . the corresponding quasiparticles are sometimes called _ partiholes_.    note that the above two examples  the interacting bose and fermi gas  are neither galilei nor poincare covariant .",
    "this allows us to consider more general dispersion relations .",
    "however , we do not know whether these systems admit a quasiparticle interpretation or possess some kind of scattering theory . unfortunately , rigorous results in this direction are rather modest .",
    "( there are attempts at scattering theory for some non - relativistic models of quantum field theory , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there exist also some results in a purely perturbative approach @xcite ) .      the concept of a quasiparticle - like system , as defined in subsect .",
    "[ approximate versus exact quasiparticles ] , is probably too strong for many applications .",
    "let us propose a weaker property , which is more likely to be satisfied in various situations .",
    "again , our starting point is a translation invariant system described by its hamiltonian and momentum @xmath16 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath9 is bounded from below , with @xmath109 , as usual , denoting the ground state energy .",
    "we will say that the _ excitation spectrum of @xmath16 is quasiparticle - like _ if it coincides with the excitation spectrum of a quasiparticle system ( see ( [ quasa1 ] ) and ( [ quasa2 ] ) ) .",
    "clearly , the excitation spectrum of a quasiparticle - like system with a bounded from below hamiltonian is quasiparticle - like .",
    "however , a system may have a quasiparticle - like excitation spectrum without being a quasiparticle - like system .",
    "a quasiparticle - like excitation spectrum has special properties .",
    "in particular , it satisfies ( [ endeq0 ] ) and ( [ endeq1 ] ) .",
    "there exists a heuristic , but , we believe , a relatively convincing general argument why realistic translation invariant quantum systems in thermodynamic limit at zero temperature should satisfy ( [ endeq0 ] ) and ( [ endeq1 ] ) .",
    "it was essentially described at length in @xcite , but for the convenience of the reader we reproduce it here .",
    "note in particular that it the infinite size of the quantum system plays an important role in this argument .    consider a quantum gas in a box of a very large side length @xmath2 , described by @xmath12 . for shortness ,",
    "let us drop the superscript @xmath2 .",
    "first of all , it seems reasonable to assume that the system possesses a translation invariant ground state , which we will denote by @xmath20 , so that @xmath22 , @xmath23",
    ". thus ( [ endeq0 ] ) holds .",
    "let @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "we can find eigenvectors with these eigenvalues , that is , vectors @xmath112 satisfying @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "let us make the assumption that it is possible to find operators @xmath115 that are polynomials in creation and annihilation operator smeared with functions well localized in configuration space such that @xmath116 , and which approximately create the vectors @xmath112 from the ground state , that is @xmath117 .",
    "( note that here a large size of @xmath2 plays a role ) . by replacing @xmath118 with @xmath119 for some @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122",
    ", we can make sure that the regions of localization of @xmath123 and @xmath121 are separated by a large distance",
    ".    now consider the vector @xmath124 .",
    "clearly , @xmath125 @xmath126 looks like the vector @xmath112 in the region of localization of @xmath115 , elsewhere it looks like @xmath127 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath9 involves only expressions of short range ( the potential decays in space ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that @xmath128 if this is the case , it implies that @xmath129 . thus ( [ endeq1 . ] ) holds .",
    "now suppose that @xmath16 is an arbitrary translation invariant system with a bounded from below hamiltonian . for simplicity , assume that its ground state energy is zero .",
    "we assume that we know its excitation spectrum @xmath18 .",
    "there are two natural questions    1 .",
    "is @xmath18 quasiparticle - like ? 2 .",
    "if it is the case , to what extent its dispersion relations are determined uniquely ?    in order to give partial answers to the above questions , recall the functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 , as well as the sets @xmath37 and @xmath43 that we defined in subsects [ excitation spectrum ] and [ essential excitation spectrum ] .",
    "suppose that the excitation spectrum of @xmath16 is quasiparticle - like .",
    "then the following is true :    1 .",
    "@xmath130 is subadditive .",
    "2 .   we can partly reconstruct some of the dispersion relations : @xmath131 consequently , for @xmath132 satisfying @xmath133 , @xmath134 where @xmath91 was defined in ( [ mino ] ) .",
    "3 .   if the number of quasiparticles species is finite , we can reconstruct @xmath135 from @xmath130 : @xmath136    the existential part of the inverse problem has a partial solution :    suppose that @xmath137 be a given subbadditive function .",
    "consider the translation invariant system @xmath138 then @xmath139    the answer to the uniqueness part of the inverse problem is negative .",
    "the only situation where we can identify dispersion relations from the spectral information involves @xmath37 , see ( [ paio ] ) .",
    "the following example shows that we have quite a lot of freedom in choosing a dispersion relation giving a prescribed excitation spectrum .",
    "for instance , all the hamiltonians below have the same excitation spectrum and essential excitation spectrum with @xmath140 : @xmath141 where @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are arbitrary .",

    "the solution of this kind that minimizes @xmath340 is called the _ normal _ or _ hartree - fock solution_.    one expects that under some conditions the normal solution is not the global minimum of @xmath340 .",
    "more precisely , one expects that a global minimum is reached by a configuration satisfying @xmath391 where at least some of @xmath392 are different from @xmath393 .",

    ". one can expect that it is strictly positive , since otherwise the two functions @xmath395 and @xmath396 would have a coinciding zero , which seems unlikely .",

    "let us only remark that such conditions involve some kind of negative definiteness of the quadratic form @xmath401  this is what we vaguely indicated by saying that the interaction is attractive .",
    "indeed , multiply the definition of @xmath399 with @xmath402 and sum it up over @xmath132 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath403 the left hand side of ( [ resa9 ] ) is positive .",

    "let us also indicate why one expects that the solution corresponding to ( [ resa1 ] ) is a minimum of @xmath340 .",
    "we compute the second derivative : @xmath405 substituting ( [ resa1 ] ) to the first term on the right of ( [ resa2 ] ) gives @xmath406 which is positive definite .",
