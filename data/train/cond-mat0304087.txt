    "since onsager @xcite and kirkwood @xcite it is well known that the macroscopic dielectric constant ( or permittivity ) @xmath0 of a material of polar , polarizable molecules is related to the fluctuations of the total dipole moment of a spatially homogeneous sample @xcite . while the relation is well understood for infinite or periodic @xcite bulk materials , much less",
    "is known about the static dielectric properties of confined polar fluids , or polar fluids near interfaces .",
    "the generally accepted view is that near interfaces , the dipole moment fluctuations are restricted , e.g. when dipole moments of individual molecules tend to orient themselves preferentially parallel or perpendicular to an interface , and that the resulting local permittivity is reduced relative to its bulk value .",
    "this is particularly important when considering water molecules near electrodes , biological macromolecules ( e.g. proteins or dna ) or membranes in electrochemical and biophysical applications . on purely phenomenological grounds",
    "it is often assumed that the dielectric response of a polar solvent in such situations may be described by a distance - dependent permittivity , which is then incorporated in expressions for the coulomb interaction energy between ions in solution @xcite .",
    "the present paper attempts a first step beyond such purely _ ad hoc _ procedures , in terms of a simplified molecular picture of a polar fluid near an interface , by generalising onsager s well - known cavity model for bulk dielectric properties to an inhomogeneous situation .",
    "the objective is to determine a permittivity `` profile '' which varies with the distance from a planar interface separating a continuous medium of given permittivity @xmath1 from the medium made up of dipolar molecules .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the generalised onsager cavity model is described in section [ sec : onsager - model - near ] .",
    "a self - consistent set of equations determining the permittivity profile is derived in section [ sec : reaction - field ] . in section [ sec : asympt - behav - diel ] the asymptotic behaviour of the dielectric permittivity far away from the interface is examined .",
    "the solution to the full electrostatic problem leading to a locally self - consistent permittivity profile is sketched in section [ sec : solut - electr - probl ] .",
    "the results will be discussed in the final section .",
    "consider two dielectric media separated by a planar interface , as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the horizontal interface is placed at @xmath2 . below it ( @xmath3 )",
    "extends a dielectric medium considered to be a homogeneous continuum of constant permittivity @xmath1 . above the interface ( @xmath4 )",
    "extends a polar fluid made up of identical spherical molecules carrying a dipole moment @xmath5 of fixed magnitude @xmath6 .",
    "the interface breaks the rotational invariance of the fluid , so that its dielectric response is _ a priori _ described by a permittivity tensor @xmath7 which , by symmetry , is diagonal and of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the identical @xmath10 and @xmath11 components parallel to the interface , while @xmath12 denotes the vertical @xmath13 component .",
    "is in a spherical cavity with centre a distance @xmath14 above the dielectric interface , below which extends a continuum of permittivity @xmath1 .",
    "the fluid in region ii has a local permittivity tensor @xmath7 . far above the wall",
    "the electric field is the external field @xmath15 .",
    "the polar angle of dipole with respect to the @xmath14 axis is denoted by @xmath16 . ]    in view of an approximate calculation of @xmath9 and @xmath12 , one assumes , following onsager @xcite , that a test molecule is placed at the centre of a spherical cavity of radius @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the volume per molecule . since we are interested in permittivity profiles , the centre of the cavity is placed at a vertical distance @xmath14 from the planar interface , and the dielectric response will be determined as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the cavity is surrounded by a dielectric continuum characterised by the dielectric tensor @xmath7 , of yet unknown components @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "following onsager s mean field approach @xcite , the dipole @xmath5 inside the cavity is subjected to a cavity field @xmath19 , induced by some external field taking the value @xmath15 far above the planar interface ( i.e. at @xmath20 ) .",
    "in addition , the dipole polarises the surrounding dielectric media i and ii , giving rise to polarisation charges on the surface of the cavity and on the planar interface . these polarisation charges generate a reaction field @xmath21 acting on the dipole inside the cavity . both fields @xmath19 and @xmath21 are calculated from the laws of macroscopic electrostatics .",
    "the mean dipole moment inside the cavity is then calculated by averaging over orientations with the appropriate boltzmann weight determined by the coupling of the dipole to the total electric field @xmath22 inside the cavity .",
    "the dielectric tensor components @xmath9 and @xmath12 are finally determined by identifying the calculated mean dipole with the predictions of macroscopic electrostatics for parallel and orthogonal orientations of the external field .",
    "the calculation sketched above is quite straightforward in the case of isotropic , bulk dielectrics , but , as will become clear below , it is technically much more involved in the presence of an interface between two different dielectric media .    in the isotropic bulk , where @xmath23 , the onsager mean field theory leads to the classic result @xcite @xmath24 valid for non - polarizable , polar molecules , @xmath25 being the number density of these molecules and @xmath26 the thermal energy",
    "; @xmath27 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "the predictions of , which does not account for correlations between the orientations of neighbouring dipoles ( as embodied in the kirkwood @xmath28-factor , see eq . ) , considerably underestimate the value of @xmath29 for dense , highly polar liquids , and the same is hence to be expected for the results near the planar interface .",
    "in the presence of the planar interface ( cf . fig . [ fig:1 ] ) , the polarisation vector @xmath30 in region  ii depends on the vertical coordinate @xmath14 . if @xmath31 is the local electric field , the local susceptibility and dielectric tensors @xmath32 and @xmath7 can be defined as usual by the linear relation @xmath33 assuming a purely local response .    as explained in the previous section ,",
    "the local field acting on the dipole @xmath5 inside the cavity is the sum of the cavity and reaction fields . due to the linear nature of electrostatics",
    ", the reaction field depends linearly on the dipole moment @xmath34 the tensor @xmath35 depends on @xmath1 and @xmath7 and on the geometric parameters @xmath36 and @xmath14 . due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath35 must be diagonal .",
    "a vertical dipole ( parallel to the symmetry axis @xmath37 ) can only induce a vertical reaction field . for an arbitrary orientation of @xmath5 , the reaction field must change sign under the inversion of the dipole @xmath38 . in the case of a horizontal dipole ,",
    "this inversion is equivalent to a rotation by @xmath39 around the vertical symmetry axis , implying that the reaction field has no vertical component",
    ". the horizontal component must moreover be parallel to the dipole , since the system is invariant under reflections by the plane containing @xmath5 and the vertical symmetry axis .",
    "the tensor @xmath35 is hence of the same diagonal form as the permittivity tensor , with one vertical component @xmath40 , and two horizontal components @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the cavity field is proportional to the external field @xmath42 where the tensor @xmath43 can only depend on @xmath1 , @xmath29 , and on the geometric parameters @xmath36 and @xmath14 .",
    "the same symmetry arguments as adove show that the tensor @xmath43 is diagonal .",
    "if the dipole interact with the cavity field via the energy @xmath44 , the interaction energy with the reaction field is given by @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , increasing gradually the dipole moment from zero to its final value , we obtain a factor @xmath46 when we integrate the infinitesimal interaction energy increment @xmath47 because of the linear relation .",
    "the induced dipole moment per unit volume ( or polarisation ) is , within the cavity model , @xmath48 where the integrations are over all orientations of the test dipole . for small external field",
    ", the polarisation will be proportional to the field , and we can expand the exponential to first order in the reaction field . taking into account the diagonal nature of the cavity field tensor @xmath43 ,",
    "we obtain in linear response @xmath49 in going from the first to the second line of , integrals involving an odd function of @xmath5 vanish . in the last expression",
    "we have defined the dielectric susceptibility with respect to the external field @xmath50 the components of this tensor are @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 denotes the error function ) .",
    "the external susceptibility must now be related to the local susceptibility @xmath32 defined in .    in the present case of a planar interface ,",
    "it is easy to find the macroscopic relation between the polarisation @xmath55 and the external field . for a given field far away from the wall and a given permittivity profile , the electric field at every point is known from the macroscopic equations .",
    "when the external field is horizontal , it will stay constant throughout space , since the permittivity is only varying perpendicularly to the field . therefore the field felt by the test dipole in the macroscopic picture is simply @xmath15 , leading to the polarisation @xmath56 . in the case of a vertical field , however , the displacement field @xmath57 will remain constant .",
    "therefore , at distance @xmath14 from the interface , the electric field is @xmath58 , leading to the polarisation @xmath59 .",
    "the permittivity far away from the wall is simply the bulk permittivity .",
    "comparing the above expression of the polarisation with the result obtained from onsager s model gives    @xmath60    the tensors @xmath43 and @xmath35 [ which determine @xmath61 via ] are to be obtained by solving the associated electrostatic problems .",
    "since the permittivity tensor @xmath62 itself enters these problems , equations and are self - consistent equations for this permittivity profile .    before determining the cavity and reaction field tensors in section  v ,",
    "we obtain first the asymptotic behaviour of the permittivity .",
    "it is instructive to obtain an approximate estimate of the corrections to the reaction and cavity fields , valid for a test dipole far away from the interface , such that @xmath63 .",
    "the dielectric tensor will then practically reduce to the bulk value @xmath64 .",
    "the polarisation of the cavity surface by the test dipole in the absence of an external field is such that the latter acts outside the cavity as an effective dipole moment of strength @xmath65 .",
    "the cavity model only yields an approximate estimate of the effective dipole moment .",
    "an exact calculation , sketched in appendix [ app : a ] , yields a general expression for the screened ( effective ) dipole moment which reduces to the prediction of the cavity model if the onsager value for @xmath29 is substituted in equation .",
    "the additional electric field generated by the polarisation of the planar interface at @xmath2 by this effective dipole may be described as being due to an image dipole of strength @xmath66 situated at @xmath67 below the interface . since @xmath68 , the resulting field",
    "may be regarded as homogeneous over a distance equal to the diameter @xmath69 of the cavity .",
    "the reaction field inside the cavity will be that outside the cavity , amplified by a factor @xmath70 .",
    "the field depends of course on the orientation of the image dipole which itself is determined by the orientation of the test dipole .",
    "if the test dipole has both vertical and horizontal components , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the reaction field is therefore @xmath73\\biggr],\\ ] ] and hence is no longer collinear with @xmath5 .",
    "the electrostatic interaction energy of the dipole with the reaction field @xmath74 therefore depends on the orientation of the molecule . in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "it can be seen that the orientation dependence of the energy is negligible even in the immediate vicinity of the wall .    in the presence of an external field",
    "two parts are contributing to the effective dipole moment .",
    "the test molecule aligns on average with the cavity field , leading to a permanent dipole , which appears screened outside the cavity .",
    "a second contribution originates from the polarisation of the cavity surface by the external field .",
    "both terms lead to an electric field outside the cavity as due to an effective dipole moment @xmath75{\\boldsymbol{\\rm e}}^{\\text{ext}}.\\ ] ] the corresponding image dipole @xmath76 induces an approximately homogeneous field @xmath77 near the cavity , which is the first order correction of the local electric field @xmath78 over the external field . from the local field",

    "to find the tensors @xmath43 and @xmath35 we have to solve two purely electrostatic problems .",
    "one involves finding the reaction field induced by the polarised material at the centre of the cavity . in this case",
    "we consider a dipole at the centre of the spherical cavity , surrounded by dielectric material of permittivity @xmath7 at a distance @xmath14 above a medium with isotropic permittivity @xmath1 .",
    "the electric field must decay to zero as @xmath83 . to find the cavity field on the other hand",
    ", we consider an empty sphere , and an external field which goes to @xmath15 far from the cavity . in both problems",
    "the electrostatic equations are the same ; they differ only in the boundary conditions : for the cavity field we require the electric field to be finite within the sphere and approach a prescribed value at infinity ; for the reaction field we require a dipolar singularity at the centre of the sphere and the electric field vanishes far away from the interface .",
    "in the geometry considered here there are two dielectric interfaces : one is a planar interface where the dielectric permittivity jumps from @xmath1 to @xmath7 .",
    "the other is a sphere where the permittivity jumps from @xmath7 to 1 .",
    "these interfaces divide space into three regions as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] . within each region",
    "the electrostatic potential satisfies the relation @xmath84 with a spatially varying tensor permittivity @xmath62 , eq",
    ". can not be solved analytically . instead of computing a numerical solution",
    ", we shall determine the cavity and reaction fields for the simpler case of a _ constant _ and _ scalar _ permittivity @xmath29 .",
    "these results will then be used to determine a permittivity profile from the onsager equations and .",
    "these equations will be solved in a locally self - consistent manner : when the cavity is at a distance @xmath14 from the interface , we shall use the cavity and reaction field tensors corresponding to the case of a homogeneous and isotropic medium ii of dielectric constant @xmath85/3 $ ] .",
    "this scheme provides a reasonnable approximation to @xmath86 , since the deviations of @xmath86 from the bulk behaviour @xmath64 prove to be small for @xmath87 ( see section  vi ) .    in each regions ,",
    "equation now reduces to laplace s equation @xmath88 at the dielectric interfaces we impose the usual boundary conditions : the tangential component of the electric field @xmath89 must be identical on both sides of the interface : @xmath90 this condition is automatically satisfied if the potential is continuous across the interface : @xmath91 likewise the normal part of the displacement field @xmath92 must be identical on both sides of the boundary . @xmath93    the electrostatic problem is best solved in bispherical coordinates .",
