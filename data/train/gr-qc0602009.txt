    "in 1969 , on the sixtieth anniversary of max born s @xcite first analysis of the field of a uniformly accelerated charge , ginzburg , nobelist in 2003 , reanalyzed @xcite this  what he called``perpetual problem of classical physics , '' with the conclusion that the problem `` is already clear enough not to be regarded as perpetual . ''",
    "ginzburg confirmed the presence of radiation and emphasized that the vanishing of the radiation reaction force during the uniformly accelerated motion of the charge `` is in no way paradoxical , in spite of the presence of radiation , '' since `` a non - zero total energy flux through a surface surrounding a charge at a zero radiation force is exactly equal to the decrease of the field energy in the volume enclosed by this surface . '' despite ginzburg s view , however , the problem does not seem to lose its a number of distinguished physicists who dealt with it before ginzburg like sommerfeld , schott , von laue , pauli and others have , after ginzburg , been followed by such authors as , for example , bondi @xcite , boulware @xcite , peierls @xcite , thirring @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the fields and radiation patterns from uniformly accelerated general multipole particles were also studied @xcite .",
    "the december 2000 issue of annals of physics contains three papers by eriksen and grn @xcite with numerous references on .",
    "( yet , except for @xcite and @xcite , the explicit citations above are not contained in @xcite . )",
    "spacetimes describing play fundamental role in general relativity .",
    "they are the only explicit solutions of einstein s field equations known which are radiative and represent the fields of finite sources . born fields in electrodynamics are produced by two charges moving along an in opposite directions with uniform accelerations of the same magnitude .",
    "they have two symmetries : they are axially symmetric and symmetric with respect to the boosts along the axis of symmetry . their general - relativistic counterparts , the boost rotation symmetric spacetimes , are unique because of a theorem which roughly states that in axially symmetric , locally asymptotically flat spacetimes the only additional symmetry that does not exclude radiation is the boost symmetry .",
    "the boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes have been used in gravitational radiation theory , quantum gravity , and as test beds in numerical relativity ; their general structure is described in @xcite , their applications and new references are given in the reviews @xcite .",
    "one of the best known examples , the so - called c - metric , describing uniformly accelerated black holes , is the only boost - rotation symmetric solution known also for a nonvanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "asymptotically this c - metric approaches de  sitter spacetime if @xmath1 .",
    "it is well - known from the classical work of penrose @xcite on the asymptotic properties of fields and spacetimes that , in contrast to asymptotically minkowskian spacetimes with null ( lightlike ) conformal infinities @xmath2 , asymptotically de  sitter vacuum spacetimes have two disjoint conformal infinities , past and future , which are both _",
    "spacelike_. when @xmath3 , as in anti - de  sitter space , the conformal infinity is timelike , and it is not disjoint .",
    "( in the analytically extended c - metrics , there is an infinite number of such infinities which can be reached by going black holes like with a reissner - nordtrm black hole , but this is not pertinent to the present work . )",
    "the importance of de  sitter spacetime in the history of modern cosmology seems to grow steadily .",
    "the de  sitter universe became the standard cosmological model in steady state theory , more recently , as the of inflationary models , and today , with indications that @xmath1 in our universe , it is an asymptote of all indefinitely expanding friedmann - robertson - walker models with @xmath1 . in fact",
    "much more general cosmological models with @xmath4 approach de  sitter model asymptotically in time .",
    "this manifestation of the validity of the @xcite , @xcite will also be noticed in the properties of the fields analyzed in this work .",
    "motivated by the role of the born solution in classical electrodynamics , by the importance of the boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes in general relativity , and by the relevance of de  sitter space in contemporary cosmology , we have recently generalized the born solution for scalar and electromagnetic fields to the case of two charges uniformly accelerated in de  sitter universe @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we give calculations and detailed proofs of the results and statements briefly sketched in our paper @xcite .",
    "in addition , we investigate the character of the field in a number of various coordinate systems which are relevant either in a general - relativistic context or from a cosmological perspective .",
    "the appropriate coordinates and corresponding tetrad fields were important in finding our recent results on a general asymptotic behavior of fields in the neighborhood of future infinity @xmath5 in asymptotically de  sitter spacetimes @xcite . in obtaining these results",
    "we were inspired by the inspection of the electromagnetic fields from uniformly accelerated charges in de  sitter universe .",
    "it was known from the work of penrose since late 1960 s that the radiation field is defined when @xmath5 is spacelike  that it depends on the direction in which @xmath5 is approached .",
    "however , no explicit models were available .",
    "the investigation of the test fields of accelerated charges in de  sitter universe has served as a useful example ; it was then generalized also to the study of asymptotic and radiative properties of the c - metric with @xmath1 @xcite , as well as to the case of the c - metric with @xmath3 when infinity is timelike @xcite .",
    "( for other recent works on the c - metric , see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "these studies led to more general conclusions @xcite : the directional pattern of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation near de  sitter - like conformal infinity has a universal character , determined by the algebraic ( petrov ) type of a solution of the maxwell / einstein equations considered . in particular , the radiation field vanishes along directions opposite to principal null directions . very recently",
    "analogous conclusions have been obtained for spacetimes with anti - de  sitter asymptotics @xcite .    since",
    "past and future infinities are spacelike in de  sitter spacetime , there exist particle and event horizons . under the presence of the horizons , purely retarded fields ( appropriately defined )",
    "become singular or even can not be constructed at the , i.e. , at future light cones of the at @xmath6 at which the sources",
    "the universe .",
    "in @xcite we analyzed this phenomenon in detail and constructed smooth ( outside the sources ) fields involving both retarded and advanced effects .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , to be is quite a different matter than to be .",
    "this reveals the double meaning of the second  perhaps somewhat enigmatic ",
    "part of the title of this paper .",
    "its plan is as follows . in order to gain an understanding of the generalized born solution in de  sitter space it is advantageous to be familiar with some details of the classical born solution in minkowski space .",
    "hence , its properties most relevant for our purpose are summarized in section  [ sc : bornm ] .",
    "here we also discuss why in minkowski space problems with purely retarded fields of uniformly accelerated particles do not arise .",
    "there exists vast literature on de  sitter space in which various types of coordinates are employed .",
    "we shall construct fields in de  sitter space by using its conformal relations to minkowski space . for our aim coordinate systems on conformally compactified spaces and their properties",
    "will be particularly useful .",
    "these , together with several and coordinate systems , will be described and graphically illustrated in conformal diagrams in section  [ sc : coor ] .",
    "what is meant by is defined and the properties of the corresponding worldlines are studied in section  [ sc : accpart ] . for technical reasons",
    "it is more advantageous to consider particles which asymptotically start and end at the poles of coordinates covering de  sitter space , i.e. , particles ( section  [ ssc : patpoles ] ) . in order to find a direct relation between the standard form of the born solution produced by two charges at each time",
    "located symmetrically with respect to the origin of minkowski space and the generalized born solution in de  sitter space , it is necessary to construct also worldlines of uniformly accelerated particles which are ( section  [ ssc : patequat ] ) .    with the worldlines of accelerated particles available ,",
    "it is advantageous to consider coordinates in de  sitter space which are centered on these worldlines .",
    "these and are obtained , in a constructive manner , in section  [ sc : acccoor ] .    section  [ sc : fields ] is devoted to the fields from particles .",
    "here we also study in detail their properties in various coordinate systems introduced before .",
    "the fields of particles are found in section  [ sc : bornds ] by a simple rotation .",
    "starting from these fields we demonstrate by means of which limiting procedure the standard born field in minkowski space can be regained .",
    "finally , we conclude by few remarks in section  [ sc : concl ] .    the paper contains a rather extensive appendix in which nine families of coordinate systems employed in the main text are described in detail , illustrated graphically , their relations are given , and corresponding metric forms as well as orthonormal tetrads are presented .",
    "we believe the appendix can be used as a general - purpose catalogue in other studies of physics in de  sitter spacetime .",
    "it was einstein in 1908 , inspired by a letter from planck , who first defined a motion in special relativity @xcite .",
    "a particle is in uniformly accelerated motion if its acceleration has a fixed constant value in instantaneous rest frames of the particle .",
    "this can be stated in a covariant form ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as @xmath7 @xmath8 being four - velocity , @xmath9 covariant derivative with respect to proper time , @xmath10 four - acceleration , and @xmath11 is the projection tensor into the hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath8 .",
    ".   implies @xmath12 so that the condition of uniform acceleration guarantees that the magnitude of the four - acceleration is constant , @xmath13 although @xmath14 . integrating eq .   in minkowski spacetime",
    ", one finds that the worldline of a uniformly accelerated particle is a hyperbola @xcite .",
    "one can then choose an inertial frame , in which the initial three - velocity and three - acceleration are parallel ; in such frames the motion is spatially 1-dimensional .",
    "it can be produced by putting a test charged particle into a homogenous electric field with initial velocity aligned with the field .",
    "the motion along the @xmath15  axis is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mink ] . there",
    ", in fact , _ two _ particles uniformly accelerated in opposite directions are shown , the one moving along the positive ( @xmath16 for particle @xmath17 in the figure ) and the second one along the negative @xmath15  axis ( @xmath18 for particle @xmath19 ) ; their worldlines parametrized by proper time @xmath20 are @xmath21 or @xmath22 here we have chosen the particles to be at rest at @xmath23 at @xmath24",
    ". then their three - acceleration at initial moment @xmath24 is @xmath25 . as @xmath26 , the three - velocity @xmath27 approaches the velocity of light",
    "this is the well - known .",
    "the worldlines of the particles coincide with the orbits of the boost killing vector in the @xmath28 plane , @xmath29 these orbits , given by @xmath30 , @xmath31 , are timelike at @xmath32 , but they are spacelike at @xmath33 . the fields ( scalar , electromagnetic , higher - spin ) produced by charged particles in the hyperbolic motion will have boost - rotational symmetry .",
    "they are thus static in the region @xmath32 as introduced in @xcite , however , we can expect them to be radiative in the region @xmath33.    consider a massless scalar field @xmath34 with the scalar charge source @xmath35 satisfying , in a general 4-dimensional spacetime , the wave equation @xmath36\\,\\sf=\\sfsource\\commae\\ ] ] in which @xmath37 is the curved - space dalambertian , and @xmath38 is the scalar curvature ( of course , in minkowski space @xmath39 ) .",
    "we are interested in a field due to two monopole particles with the same constant scalar charge of magnitude @xmath40 moving along hyperbolae . the source at a spacetime point @xmath41 is thus given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the worldlines of the particles .",
    "the resulting fields may be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is produced by @xmath46 .",
    "the retarded and advanced fields of these sources are constructed and analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the retarded and advanced fields due to the particle @xmath17 or @xmath47 are all given by exactly _ identical _ expression @xmath48 which , however , is valid in different regions of spacetime .",
    "namely , @xmath49 @xmath50 being the step function and upper / lower sign is valid for retarded / advanced case . the quantity @xmath51 in the denominator is given by @xmath52 it has the meaning of a or it is a spatial distance of the ( field ) point from the position of the source at retarded or advanced time . here , as usual , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55",
    "the fields , as well as , are , at first glance , axially ( rotationally ) symmetric .",
    "they are also unchanged under the boost along the @xmath15  axis .",
    "the field @xmath56 can , in fact , be viewed as the field due to both accelerated particles , i.e. , as the field corresponding to the source . inspecting regions at which the retarded and advanced fields are non - vanishing we discover that @xmath56 admits the interpretation as arising from 1-parametric combination of retarded and advanced effects from both particles : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an arbitrary constant parameter . in particular ,",
    "choosing @xmath59 , the field @xmath56 arises from @xmath60 from both particles . with @xmath61 ,",
    "the field can be interpreted as being caused by purely retarded effects from particle @xmath17 in region @xmath62 , and by purely advanced effects from particle @xmath47 in region @xmath63 .",
    "the case of electrodynamics is very similar .",
    "the solution corresponding to the scalar field was found by born in 1909 @xcite .",
    "it is customarily given in cylindrical coordinates ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , however , in order to compare it with its generalization to de  sitter universe , it is more convenient to write it down in spherical coordinates : @xmath64 the field can be obtained from the linard - wiechert retarded and advanced potentials of two charged particles moving along hyperbolae , however , in contrast to the scalar case when charges are exactly the same , the electric charges have _ opposite _ signs .",
    "similarly to the scalar case , the field is smooth everywhere , except for the places where the particles occur .",
    "@xmath65 can be interpreted in the precisely same way as the scalar field , i.e. , as the 1-parametric combination of retarded and advanced effects from both charges , analogously to eq .  .",
    "however , in the electromagnetic case an exact form of retarded and advanced fields from a single particle is a more subtle issue . considering that the field in the region @xmath62 may be interpreted as the retarded effect emitted from the charge which moves along @xmath66 , it is natural to try to exclude advanced effects of the other particle by requiring the field to vanish in the region @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mink ] ) .",
    "the field is then not smooth at the null hypersurface @xmath67 . in the scalar case",
    "such a field _ does _ represent the pure retarded field of the single particle , cf .",
    ". however , in the electromagnetic case the field @xmath68 corresponds to sources consisting not only of the particle but also of a moving along hypersurface @xmath69 with velocity of light @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to obtain a pure retarded field of the only single particle by modifying the field with a delta function valued term localized on @xmath69 @xcite .    in de  sitter space",
    "such a modification is not feasible because the advanced fields can not be excluded .",
    "the underlying cause is the _ null _",
    "character of the past conformal infinity in minkowski spacetime , whereas in de  sitter spacetime both future and past conformal infinities are _ spacelike_. as a consequence , the gauss constraint restricts the data at the spacelike past infinity , and it can be shown that a purely retarded field of a point - like charge can not satisfy this constraint @xcite .",
    "the absence of purely retarded fields is also related to a different character of the past horizon of a particle . since the worldline of a particle the universe through the past spacelike infinity , there exists the past particle horizon , called also the . in de",
    "sitter space a purely retarded electromagnetic field of a point - like charge can not be constructed on the whole cone .",
    "in minkowski spacetime the creation light cone of a particle moving asymptotically in the past freely , coincides with the whole past null infinity , and thus it does not belong to the physical spacetime . eternally accelerated particles can the minkowski spacetime at a point of the past null infinity  as , for example , uniformly accelerated particles do .",
    "like in de  sitter case , in conformal spacetime the past horizon of such particles forms the null cone but , in contrast to de  sitter space , it has one generator in common with the null infinity . in physical spacetime",
    "this horizon thus corresponds to a null hyperplane  for the particle @xmath17 it is just the hyperplane @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mink])and so its spatial sections are not compact .",
    "thanks to this non - compactness the behavior of the retarded field on the horizon can be to the infinity .",
    "we analyzed this issue in detail in ref .",
    "the fields due to various types of uniformly accelerated sources in de  sitter spacetime found in @xcite , as well as those described briefly in ref .",
    "@xcite , were constructed by employing the conformal relation between minkowski and de  sitter spacetimes .",
    "when analyzing the worldlines of the sources in de  sitter spacetime and their relation to the corresponding worldlines in minkowski spacetime we need to introduce appropriate coordinate systems .",
    "suitable coordinates will later be used to exhibit various properties of the fields .",
    "an extensive literature exists on various types of coordinates in de  sitter space ( e.g. @xcite ) , but we want to survey some of them in this section . in particular , we relate them to the corresponding coordinates on conformally related minkowski spaces since this does not appear to be given elsewhere . in the next section , after identifying the worldlines of uniformly accelerated particles in de  sitter space , we shall construct new coordinate systems tied to such particles , such as rindler - type coordinates , or robinson - trautman - type coordinates in which the null cones emanating from the particles have especially simple forms .",
    "these coordinate systems will turn out to be very useful in analyzing the fields . here , in the main text , however , only a brief description of relevant coordinates will be given .",
    "more details , including both formulas and illustrations , are relegated to the appendix .",
    "as it is well - known from textbooks on general relativity ( for a recent pedagogical exposition , see @xcite ) , de  sitter spacetime , which is the solution of einstein vacuum equations with a cosmological term @xmath70 , is best visualized as the 4-dimensional hyperboloid imbedded in flat 5-dimensional minkowski space .",
