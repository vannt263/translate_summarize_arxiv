    "dimensionality plays an important role in condensed matter physics , with many fascinating new phenomena emerging as the number of dimensions is reduced . with the introduction of",
    "improved semiconductor growth techniques over the past few decades , physical realisation of these systems has become possible .",
    "one of these systems is a quantum well , fabricated by sandwiching a layer of semiconductor between two layers of another material with a higher bandgap .",
    "the motion of electrons and holes is ` frozen ' in the growth direction , and in modelling the system we may consider the electrons and holes as being essentially confined to a plane . as in bulk semiconductors , the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes leads to bound states , known as _ excitons _ , which are extremely important for the optical properties of the quantum well .",
    "the introduction of a strong magnetic field in the growth direction leads to further interesting phenomena in two - dimensional systems . at sufficiently low temperatures , many - electron correlations become important and new states of matter are formed .",
    "one of these states of matter is an incompressible quantum liquid , whose excitations carry fractional charge and obey fractional statistics .",
    "spectroscopic techniques can be used to probe the properties of such systems , and excitonic effects are again of the utmost importance .",
    "this chapter will focus on a diverse range of problems in mathematical physics which have arisen as a result of our work on the theory of excitons in semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "the areas covered include the theory of special functions , dynamical symmetries in quantum mechanics , symmetric polynomials , the theory of partitions and counting of bound states in short - range potentials .    in section [ s:2dexpart ]",
    "we discuss a fascinating numerical result that arisies from a theoretical treatment of screened excitons .",
    "this stimulates a re - evaluation of the familiar two - dimensional hydrogen atom . formulating the latter problem in momentum space leads to a new integral relation in terms of special functions , and fresh insights into the dynamical symmetry of the problem",
    "are also obtained .",
    "a discussion of an alternative potential to model screened excitons is given , and bound - state energies and scattering phase shifts for this potential are compared with those obtained using the two - dimensional analogue of the yukawa potential .",
    "in section [ s : anyonpart ] we consider an exciton consisting of a valence hole and several fractionally - charged quasielectrons ( anyons ) .",
    "a complete set of basis functions is obtained for this ` anyon exciton ' and these functions are classified using a result from the theory of partitions .",
    "expressions are derived for the overlap and interaction matrix elements of four- and six - particle systems , which describe an exciton against the background of incompressible quantum liquids with filling factors 1/3 , 2/3 and 2/5 .",
    "some exact results are obtained for the general @xmath0-particle case , including the binding energy for an exciton with zero in - plane momentum and zero internal angular momentum .",
    "modelling of a screened wannier - mott exciton in two dimensions using the stern - howard potential @xcite has revealed an intriguing numerical relation @xcite . in the search for an analytical derivation of this result",
    ", we address the simpler problem of an unscreened two - dimensional ( 2d ) exciton , which has a well - known solution in real space .",
    "it has been claimed that the aforementioned numerical relation is not strictly exact , and an alternative approach to the problem has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this has led to a new potential for modelling screened excitons , which is also considered here .",
    "illumination of a semiconductor with near - bandgap light leads to the creation of electron - hole bound states known as excitons .",
    "the study of excitons in condensed matter physics has a long history @xcite . broadly speaking",
    ", excitons can be divided into two types : hydrogen atom - like wannier - mott excitons and more tightly - bound frenkel excitons . in the present work",
    "we shall only be concerned with the first of these .",
    "advances in semiconductor growth techniques have led to the creation of almost ideal 2d systems . in such systems",
    ", confinement leads to a higher exciton binding energy than in the bulk , which makes 2d excitons more experimentally accessible .",
    "a semiconductor quantum well is a quasi - two - dimensional system , in which photoexcited electrons and holes are essentially confined to a plane as their motion is ` frozen ' in the growth direction .",
    "excitons are extremely important for the optical properties of the quantum well .",
    "if enough electrons and holes are excited , the coulomb attraction between particles may be weakened - this phenomenon is known as _",
    "screening_. the effect of screening on an exciton may be approximated by considering the electron and hole as interacting via the so - called stern - howard potential @xcite , which has the following form in real space : @xmath1\\right\\}=-\\frac{2}{\\rho } \\left\\{1-q_s\\rho\\ , s_{0,0}(q_s\\rho)\\right\\ } , \\vspace{3mm}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is known as the 2d screening wavenumber , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the struve , neumann and lommel functions , respectively .",
    "note that all lengths and energies are measured in units of three - dimensional ( 3d ) exciton bohr radius and excitonic rydberg , respectively . in these units , the radial equation for the relative electron - hole motion",
    "is given by @xmath6 this is the radial part of the 2d schrdinger equation , which is discussed in more detail in sections [ s:2dha ] and [ s : radial ] . in eq .  , @xmath7 is the azimuthal quantum number , which takes integer values .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite using eq .   have shown that with increasing screening , bound states in this potential disappear at integer values of the inverse screening wavenumber @xmath8 .",
    "this ` empirical ' observation can be formulated as the following sturm - liouville problem : @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 , and we have made the substitution @xmath12 .",
    "the zero right - hand side of eq .",
    "reflects the fact that we restrict our interest to zero - energy bound states .",
    "the function @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 and it has the following properties : @xmath15    the key result of @xcite is that the solution @xmath16 of eq .",
    "is square - integrable , i.e. @xmath17 only if @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of non - zero nodes in the radial wavefunction .",
    "notably , the potential defined in eq .   is simplified considerably if we move to fourier space : @xmath20 eq .",
    "is the 2d analogue of the familiar yukawa potential ( a standard textbook derivation for both the 2d and 3d cases can be found in @xcite , for example ) .    the most compact way to reformulate",
    "the above sturm - liouville problem is in terms of a homogeneous integral equation : @xmath21 it follows that @xmath22 is square - integrable in 2d fourier space when @xmath23 satisfies eq .  .",
    "it should be emphasised that this result is of a numerical nature and has not been proved analytically .    in an attempt to find an analytical derivation of eq .",
    "we address the simpler problem of an _ unscreened _ 2d exciton .",
    "this system is analogous to the 2d hydrogen atom , with the proton replaced by a valence hole , so we now focus our attention on such a system .",
    "the in - plane motion of an electron and hole can be described by a two - dimensional schrdinger equation for a single particle with a reduced mass . as in three dimensions ,",
    "the 2d hydrogen atom exhibits ` accidental ' degeneracy of the bound - state energy levels .    before proceeding",
    "it is necessary to discuss accidental degeneracy in more detail .",
    "the phenomenon of accidental degeneracy is well known from the theory of the 3d hydrogen atom .",
    "there are three quantum numbers @xmath24 , although the energy only depends on the principal quantum number @xmath25 .",
    "degeneracy in @xmath7 is of geometrical origin , and is due to the invariance of the system under spatial rotations . from noether",
    "s theorem @xcite , this symmetry implies the existence of a conserved quantity , which is the angular momentum @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , quantum mechanics tells us that whenever there is a conserved quantity whose components can not be measured simultaneously , then the energy eigenvalues will be degenerate @xcite .",
    "the origin of the degeneracy in @xmath27 , however , is not so obvious .",
    "in fact , this degeneracy does not have a geometrical origin , but arises from a hidden _ dynamical _ symmetry of the system .",
    "the conserved quantity associated with this accidental degeneracy is the _ runge - lenz vector _",
    "@xmath28 , the components of which can not be measured simultaneously .",
    "the existence of the runge - lenz vector is not so well known because when the schrdinger equation is separated in spherical polar coordinates , the natural choice for a complete set of commuting operators is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the hamiltonian .",
    "however , the presence of the runge - lenz vector is evident if the schrdinger equation is separated in parabolic coordinates , as the natural choice for a complete set of commuting operators is then @xmath31 . in general ,",
    "accidental degeneracy appears when the schrdinger equation can be separated in more than one coordinate system ( for a detailed review see @xcite ) .    in two dimensions",
    "there are two quantum numbers @xmath32 .",
    "however , the energy eigenvalues only depend on @xmath25 , so they are degenerate in the quantum number @xmath7 . in this case",
    "the angular momentum only has a @xmath33-component ( where @xmath33 is in the direction perpendicular to the plane of motion ) , and so it can be known precisely .",
    "the degeneracy in @xmath7 is therefore due to the existence of a 2d runge - lenz vector and a corresponding dynamical symmetry of the system .",
    "the runge - lenz vector has its origin in classical mechanics ( see fig .  [ runge ] ) , and its discovery has been variously attributed to laplace , runge , lenz and hamilton ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "[ runge ]    a result known as bertrand s theorem states that the only central forces which result in closed orbits are the inverse square law ( kepler problem ) and hooke s law @xcite .",
    "the closure of orbits is due to the conservation of an additional quantity ( apart from the energy and angular momentum ) ; in the case of the kepler problem this quantity is the runge - lenz vector @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced mass , @xmath36 is the momentum , @xmath37 is the angular momentum , @xmath38 is a positive constant and @xmath39 is the radius vector of the orbit .",
    "a quantum mechanical analogue of the runge - lenz vector was first suggested by pauli @xcite , by analogy with classical mechanics .",
    "the main difference is that it is now an operator : @xmath40 where the form of the first term on the right - hand side ensures that @xmath28 is hermitian .",
    "pauli also made the key conclusion that the existence of a runge - lenz vector constant in time implies that the hydrogen atom exhibits an additional degeneracy to that due to conservation of angular momentum .",
    "he then used @xmath28 to derive the correct energy levels for the hydrogen atom .",
    "the most important paper concerning the symmetry of the hydrogen atom was published by fock in 1935 @xcite .",
    "his first step was to consider the schrdinger equation in momentum space , which resulted in an integral equation . considering only negative energy ( bound - state ) solutions",
    ", he then projected the 3d momentum space onto the surface of a four - dimensional ( 4d ) hypersphere using a stereographic projection .",
    "after a suitable transformation of the wavefunction , the resulting schrdinger equation is seen to be invariant under rotations in 4d euclidean space .",
    "the kernel is just the green s function of laplace s equation in four dimensions .",
    "application of green s theorem yields the correct energy eigenvalues , as well as eigenfunctions in terms of hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "fock deduced that the dynamical symmetry of the hydrogen atom is described by the 4d rotation group so(4 ) , which contains the geometrical symmetry so(3 ) as a subgroup .",
    "he related this hidden symmetry to the observed degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "shortly afterwards , bargmann @xcite made the connection between pauli s quantum mechanical runge - lenz vector and fock s discovery of invariance under rotations in 4d space .",
    "the real - space schrdinger equation was also separated in parabolic coordinates , which demonstrated more explicitly the conservation of the runge - lenz vector .",
    "a major step forward was taken by alliluev @xcite , who extended fock s method of stereographic projection to the case of @xmath41 dimensions @xmath42 .",
    "he derived general expressions for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the problem , and clarified some of fock s arguments relating to the symmetry group for the @xmath41-dimensional case .",
    "alliluev also considered the 2d harmonic oscillator , the symmetry group of which is isomorphic to the 3d rotation group so(3 ) .",
    "this provided an interesting parallel to the hydrogen atom case .",
    "the first explicit use of fock s method for the 2d hydrogen atom was made by shibuya and wulfman @xcite . in this case , the eigenfunctions are just the usual spherical harmonics in three dimensions . the authors also included a graphical illustration of the degeneracy , in which two eigenfunctions which look very different on a plane are shown to be equivalent when projected onto a sphere .",
    "( it should be noted that the solution of the real - space schrdinger equation in two dimensions was first provided in @xcite , although the derivation was later repeated in @xcite . )    in the 1960s there was a revival of interest in accidental degeneracy as it was hoped that it could be applied to the theory of elementary particles .",
    "it attracted the attention of such famous names as gell - mann , schwinger and neeman . in a wide - ranging study @xcite , bander and itzykson",
    "provided a comprehensive review of work thus far .",
    "the first part gives a detailed explanation of the earlier work of fock and alliluev , the details of which are difficult to glean from the original works .",
    "two systems of generalised spherical harmonics are then considered on the 4d hypersphere : the standard hyperspherical harmonics , and an alternative in terms of wigner @xmath43-functions .",
    "these are related to separation of variables is spherical polar and parabolic coordinates , respectively .",
    "for the 3d hydrogen atom , the runge - lenz vector in real space is shown to correspond to the infinitesimal generator of rotations on the 4d hypersphere .",
    "a detailed group - theoretical analysis of the hydrogen atom is also given .",
    "in the second part , the analysis is extended to scattering states , where the momentum space is now projected onto a higher - dimensional hyperboloid .",
    "the next few decades saw little progress , probably because the important questions had already been addressed so thoroughly .",
    "however , improvements in semiconductor growth techniques enabled the manufacture of effectively 2d structures , which soon led to a resurgence of interest in the 2d hydrogen atom .    in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "the 2d runge - lenz vector was defined for the first time , and real - space solutions of the schrdinger equation were applied to problems of atomic physics in two dimensions , including dipole matrix elements , the stark effect , photon transition rates and fine / hyperfine structure .",
    "the relativistic case was also considered .",
    "returning to higher dimensions , the use of hydrogenoid orbitals as basis sets for problems in quantum chemistry led to a re - examination of the separability of the @xmath41-dimensional schrdinger equation in different coordinate systems @xcite .",
    "a novel approach was taken by nouri @xcite , who considered the @xmath41-dimensional coulomb problem in quantum phase space .",
    "this led to an expression for the wigner distribution function , from which it is possible to calculate some physical and chemical properties for the hydrogen atom .",
    "the dynamical symmetry of the hydrogen atom has also been related to kac - moody algebras , rather than the usual lie algebras @xcite .",
    "this provides fertile ground for mathematical investigation and will no doubt lead to a new direction for research .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown that the classical runge - lenz vector has a deeper physical origin , being tied to the generator of lorentz transformations for the relativistic two - body problem ; the non - relativistic kepler problem is then just a zero - order description of the more general case . in principle , it should be possible to undertake a similar analysis of the quantum mechanical problem based on the dirac equation .",
    "fock s method for the 3d hydrogen atom has been applied by muljarov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to the problem of an exciton with anisotropic mass and dielectric constant , providing an interesting alternative to a variational approach @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy is considered as a perturbation , and the perturbed wavefunction is expanded in terms of the hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "brillouin - wigner perturbation theory is then used to calculate the energy levels and eigenfunctions of the perturbed system .",
    "we now present an outline of fock s approach to the 3d hydrogen atom @xcite , which led to important insights into the dynamical symmetry of the problem .",
    "we start from the schrdinger equation in real space @xmath44 with distances and energies measured in terms of the 3d bohr radius @xmath45 and rydberg @xmath46 , where @xmath35 is the reduced mass of the system .    introducing the pair of fourier transforms between real space and momentum space @xmath47 and noting that for bound states the energy @xmath48 will be negative ,",
    "we may write the schrdinger equation as an integral equation @xmath49    the 3d momentum space is now projected onto the surface of a 4d unit hypersphere centred at the origin , and the in - plane momentum is scaled by @xmath50 . a point on the hypersphere",
    "is specified by three angles , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath53 is the angle between the position vector of the point and the fourth axis introduced in the 4d space .",
    "the transformation is given explicitly by @xmath54 an element of surface area on the unit hypersphere is given by @xmath55 and the distance between two points transforms as : @xmath56 if the wavefunction on the sphere is expressed as @xmath57 then eq .   reduces to the simple form : @xmath58    we now recognise that the kernel of the integral equation is just the green s function for the laplacian operator in four dimensions : @xmath59 which satisfies @xmath60 we also introduce a function @xmath61 which is a solution of laplace s equation , i.e. it is a harmonic function .",
    "we now wish to apply green s theorem for @xmath62 and @xmath61 to the volume bounded by the unit hypersphere , letting @xmath63 denote the unit vector from the origin to the north pole of the hypersphere : @xmath64\\,d\\tau=\\int_{\\omega}\\left[\\psi(\\mathbf{u'})\\frac{\\partial g } { \\partial n}-g\\frac{\\partial\\psi(\\mathbf{u'})}{\\partial n}\\right ] \\,d\\omega . \\vspace{3mm}\\ ] ] however , this theorem can only be applied when both @xmath62 and @xmath61 are harmonic inside the hypersphere and on its surface , whereas @xmath62 has a singularity at @xmath65 . to overcome this problem",
    "we define our surface of integration to be the surface of the unit hypersphere with a small ` hemisphere ' of radius @xmath66 removed around the point @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] ) : @xmath68 we regain the original unit hypersphere .",

    "now , the integral on the right - hand side is made up of two parts : the first part will tend to the usual surface integral over the original unit hypersphere as @xmath70 , whereas the second part over the small ` hemisphere ' must be considered in more detail .",
    "for the first term , denoting the small hemispherical surface by @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an element of solid angle , and so this term vanishes as @xmath70 .",

    "each energy level is @xmath96-fold degenerate , the so - called accidental degeneracy .",
    "the difference between the factor @xmath97 in the 2d case and @xmath98 in the 3d case has been interpreted as arising from the topological peculiarity of 2d space @xcite : considering the origin as a singular point , paths that enclose the origin and those that do not can not be continuously deformed into one another .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a vector operator corresponding to the @xmath33-projection of the angular momentum @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a unit vector normal to the plane of motion of the electron and hole .",

    "( for a comprehensive review of the integer and fractional quantum hall effects see @xcite . )",
    "in 1983 , laughlin showed @xcite that the stability of the system at fractional filling factor ( number of filled landau levels ) is due to the condensation of the electron system into an incompressible quantum liquid ( iql ) . by analogy with jastrow wavefunctions in the theory of @xmath238he ,",
    "laughlin proposed a many - electron variational wavefunction for filling factor @xmath239 ( @xmath7 odd ) to describe the ground state of the iql : @xmath240 where @xmath241 are the complex electron coordinates scaled in units of magnetic length , and @xmath7 is an odd integer .",

    "numerical diagonalisation of systems with up to eight electrons for @xmath229 in a spherical geometry @xcite confirmed the accuracy of laughlin s wavefunction in describing the ground state , as well as the presence of a finite energy gap between ground and excited states .",
    "this work was later extended to @xmath242 with similar results @xcite .",
    "the use of haldane s spherical geometry in numerical models of an exciton against the background of an iql is considered in section [ s : theory ] .",
    "further progress on the nature of the quasiparticle excitations was made by halperin @xcite , who developed pseudo - wavefunctions to describe low - lying excited states in terms of a small number of quasiparticles added to the iql ground state .",
    "these pseudo - wavefunctions are of the form @xmath243 where @xmath241 are the complex coordinates of the @xmath232 quasiparticles , @xmath53 is a statistical factor and @xmath244 is a symmetric polynomial in the variables @xmath241 .",
    "halperin then used this method to construct the whole hierarchy of fractional states . from the quantisation rules that determine the allowed quasiparticle spacings he also determined that the quasiparticles are anyons obeying fractional statistics , i.e. the wavefunction changes by a complex phase factor when two particles are interchanged .",
    "( for more details on anyons and fractional statistics see @xcite . )",
    "in addition to charged quasiparticles , the iql also supports dispersive neutral excitations .",
    "the lowest branch of these neutral excitations is labelled a _",

    "strong evidence of the existence of these excitations has been provided by inelastic light scattering ( raman scattering ) experiments @xcite .",
    "returning to laughlin s wavefunction , a picture began to emerge of magnetic ` vortices ' generated by flux quanta , where the position of each vortex corresponds to a zero of the many - body wavefunction .",
    "the @xmath229 fqhe , for example , could be interpreted as the attachment of three flux quanta to each electron , forming _",

    "stability of the system at this filling factor then corresponds to a bose condensate of these composite particles .    the failure of this model to account for higher - order states with odd denominator , as well as even - denominator states ,",
    "led to the development by jain of the _ composite fermion model _ @xcite .",
    "vortices are again attached to electrons , but the fractional quantum hall effect becomes an integer quantum hall effect for the new composite particles .",
    "for example , in the @xmath229 state each electron is considered bound to two flux quanta , such that the composite particle feels an effective field of one flux quantum per particle .",
    "these composites can then be considered as fermions filling one landau level .",
    "the composite fermion model is generally accepted as providing the best current description of higher - order fqhe states ( although not everyone subscribes to this view @xcite ) , as well as a method for generating many - particle wavefunctions and their excitations .",
    "one further development that should be mentioned is the recent direct observation of fractionally - charged quasiparticles in ` shot noise ' measurements @xcite .",
    "this noise arises from a current of individual quasielectrons with charge @xmath245 tunnelling through a narrow barrier ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "whereas similar claims @xcite have been questioned in the past , the results do look extremely promising , and a great deal of work is being carried out to verify these observations .      although the earliest experimental work on the fqhe was based on magnetotransport experiments , these only allowed energies near the fermi level to be probed .",
    "the introduction of spectroscopic techniques was a significant step as it enabled the whole spectrum of energies to be studied via contactless measurements .",
    "the ideal system for such optical experiments is a gaas - algaas heterostructure .",
    "donors are placed in the layer of higher - bandgap material ( algaas ) and the electrons associated with these donors move towards the region of lower - bandgap material ( gaas ) .",
    "this process , known as modulation doping , creates a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the layer of gaas , which may be used as the basis for experimental study of the iql .",
    "however , the electric field that is used to create the 2deg also repels photoexcited holes , which necessitates adding a second barrier to restrict these holes .",
    "the physical system can be modelled by two parallel planes separated by a distance of @xmath246 magnetic lengths .",
    "it has been found that when @xmath247 the system possesses a hidden symmetry and is insensitive to electron correlations @xcite ( this is analogous to the familiar kohn theorem , which states that the excitation spectrum of a translationally - invariant system is unaffected by electron - electron interactions @xcite . ) as a result , the frequencies of all allowed transitions coincide exactly with those of an empty crystal . for this reason , charge asymmetric systems ( with @xmath248 )",

    "the hidden symmetry is broken , thus allowing electron correlation effects to influence the optical spectra .",
    "several intrinsic emission lines were observed in the photoluminescence spectrum for @xmath250 , and the most significant feature was a doublet near @xmath251 which had a similar temperature dependence to the magnetoresistance associated with the iql in transport experiments .",
    "the authors later studied a higher - mobility single quantum well , which led to the observation of a similar doublet at filling factors @xmath229 and @xmath231 . the results for @xmath251",

    "the only experimental work to study the effects of electron - hole separation on intrinsic photoluminescence was that by plentz _",
