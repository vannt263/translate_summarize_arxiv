    "in driven disordered spin systems , the form of hysteresis loop reflects the existence of the domain structure , which responds to the external magnetic field by a motion of the domain walls .",
    "in particular , an increase of the domains aligned with the field occurs while the opposite magnetisation domains shrink .",
    "thus , the magnetisation reversal processes in these systems involve a complex interplay between the motion of the domain walls and their pinning by the magnetic and structural disorder centers .",
    "driven by a slow field ramping along the hysteresis loop , the magnetisation reversal exhibits avalanches of aligned spins when the domain wall moves to a new position .",
    "the resulting burst events of magnetisation jumps is known as barkhausen noise .",
    "these avalanches exhibit scaling features that depend on the strength of pinning and the driving rate , closely reflecting the underlying dynamical mechanism . in this work ,",
    "we use the multifractal analysis of the barkhausen noise to investigate the nature of fluctuations at all scales , which characterise the active mechanisms in different pinning regimes .",

    "these phenomena represent a fascinating physics problem . besides , the occurrence of hysteresis loop and the magnetisation reversal processes provide the basis for noninvasive structural analysis of materials @xcite and technological applications .",

    "recently proposed memory devices are based on the controlled manipulation of the domain - wall motion and pinning by weak disorder or geometrical constraints in magnetic nanowires @xcite .",
    "a direct observation of the domain - wall motion in different experimental settings @xcite revealed their stochastic kinetics , exhibiting certain universal features and dependence on the type and density of pinning centers .",
    "consequently , a deeper understanding of the stochastic processes on the hysteresis loop becomes a topic of increased interest for these systems .",
    "robust scale invariance of the magnetisation reversal avalanches in disordered ferromagnets has been observed both in experiments and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the scaling behaviour of barkhausen avalanches resembles familiar critical phenomena @xcite , while the dynamics of domain walls and spin flips can be related with criticality in sandpile automata @xcite or bootstrap percolation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it shares some general features with the collective dynamical phenomena observed at fixed points by the renormalization - group analysis of model disordered systems @xcite .",
    "the scale invariance of the reversal avalanches depends on the system s dimensionality , range of interactions and the spin symmetry .",
    "in addition , these dynamical phenomena on the hysteresis were shown to depend on the magnetic anisotropy and strength of disorder @xcite , topology of the substrate @xcite , as well as the driving mode @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a variety of the exponents ( a summary of the exponents can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and universality classes in the scaling of avalanches is believed to strictly reflect differences in the underlying dynamical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the weak disorder the system spanning avalanches can occur , whose fronts represent moving individual domain walls . on the other hand ,",
    "the occurrence of many domains at strong disorder makes the mutually constrained motion of many domain walls that results in small ( subcritical ) avalanches .",
    "the transition between these regimes has been considered as a disorder - induced critical point @xcite .",
    "while the scaling of the spanning avalanches has been studied numerically with an astonishing precision @xcite , there is little knowledge about the fine - scale structure of the collective fluctuations , which are encoded in the accompanying barkhausen noise .    here",
    ", we study the multifractal properties of barkhausen noise signals across a broad range of pinning and driving conditions . we simulate the processes of magnetisation reversal along the hysteresis loop using 3-dimensional random - field ising model for the varied strength of disorder and different rates of the field ramping .",
    "the analysis reveals that the barkhausen noise exhibits a multifractal structure , which can be appropriately described by a spectrum of the generalised hurst exponents .",
    "practically , this means that the fluctuations of the magnetisation during the reversal process decompose into fractal components , each of which exhibits a different scale invariance . as a complex signal",
    ", the barkhausen noise also shows the temporal correlations , avalanching , and non - gaussian relaxation or avalanche returns .",
    "it appears that the multifractal spectrum represents a more sensitive measure of the effects of disorder strengths and changes in the driving conditions than the standardly analysed scaling of avalanches .",
    "the studied multifractal properties of the barkhausen noise provide indicators of the dynamical state of the domain walls in memory materials under experimentally relevant regimes , which combine pinning and driving .",

    "this type of the spectrum results in combined contributions of different features of the signal from the beginning of the hysteresis loop , which dominates smooth sections , and from the central part of the loop , dominating the strong fluctuations of the single - wall dynamics .",
    "hence , the large fluctuation segments of the barkhausen signal have clearly distinct fractal properties in strong and weak pinning regimes . while the smooth segments of these signals have a similar fractal features by slow driving ( cf .",

    "cc +    furthermore , the increased driving rate profoundly affects the small fluctuations , resulting in the increase of @xmath52 for @xmath89 both for strong and weak pinning .",

    "the variations of @xmath52 from @xmath100 via @xmath101 to @xmath102 in the weak random field disorder with site defects resembles the curve for strong random fields without site defects .",

    "recently , an analytical study of fully developed turbulence @xcite has revealed that the multifractal properties of the velocity fluctuations can be related to a characteristic mathematical structure of the underlying dynamical equation . here , with the numerical analysis",
    "we demonstrate that the studied barkhausen signals possess the temporal correlations as well as power - law distributions of avalanches and elementary signals .",

    "<S> the field - driven magnetisation reversal processes in disordered systems exhibit a collective behaviour that is manifested in the scale - invariance of avalanches , closely related to underlying dynamical mechanisms . using the multifractal time series analysis </S>",

    "<S> the stochastic signal represents the magnetisation discontinuities along the hysteresis loop of a 3-dimensional random field ising model simulated for varied disorder strength and driving rates . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the spectrum of the generalised hurst exponents reveals that the segments of the signal with large fluctuations represent two distinct classes of stochastic processes in weak and strong pinning regimes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , increased driving rates have a profound effect on the small fluctuation segments and broadening of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the temporal correlations , sequences of avalanches , and their scaling features complements the quantitative measures of the collective dynamics at the hysteresis loop . </S>",
    "<S> the multifractal properties of barkhausen noise describe the dynamical state of domains and precisely discriminate the weak pinning , permitting the motion of individual walls , from the mechanisms occurring in strongly disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> the multifractal nature of the reversal processes is particularly relevant for currently investigated memory devices that utilize a controlled motion of individual domain walls . </S>"
