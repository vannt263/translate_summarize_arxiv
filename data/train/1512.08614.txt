    "ten - years long monitoring enabled by the linear survey as well as late - time swift and maia observations allow us to uncover critical diagnostic information missing from the previous analyses of the mechanism responsible for the luminous flare in the sdss j095209.56 + 214313.3 galaxy .",
    "most importantly , exact timing of the event and its evolution can now be constrained ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] ) . from the difference in time between the last point on the flat part of the light curve",
    "prior to the flare and the first point on the rise , we estimate with a precision of @xmath695 days that the flare started on 2004 may 18 .",
    "unfortunately linear did not observe the peak of the optical light curve , but we are able to determine that the flare could not have been fainter than @xmath70 mag .",
    "linear survey also allows us to establish the optical variability of the host galaxy sdss  j0952 + 2143 at a level of @xmath71 mag ( outside of the flaring phase ) , removing the possibility of strong , unobscured agn activity in the host .",
    "we also use the difference imaging described in  [ sec : selection ] to localize the transient relative to the host galaxy nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : offset ] shows a contour of the difference image constructed from the flaring state images , overlaid on the host galaxy reference image .",
    "there is no significant offset detected , with the transient centroid measured from a gaussian fit located within 1@xmath51 ( 0.2 pixels or 0.45@xmath26 ) of the host galaxy centroid . assuming the sdss value for redshift ( @xmath72=0.079 ) , this translates to an offset from the core of less than 670 pc , thus not ruling out the tde hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , the optical light curve allows us to put other observations in context .",
    "we now know that the sdss photometry ( 2004 dec 20 ) and sdss spectrum ( 2005 dec 30 ) were taken approximately 210 and 580 days after the start of the flare .",
    "therefore , only linear and sdss photometry were taken during the flaring phase . by the time _ galex _",
    "photometry and sdss spectra were acquired , the flare had already faded considerably ( at least at optical wavelengths ) .",
    "although the early part of the swift bat observations were taken during the declining phase of the flare , no detection was made suggesting that there was no significant hard x - ray emission .",
    "remaining observations taken after mid-2006 could have measured only the echo of the flare in the surrounding medium .    the extended , persistent uv emission detected by swift from sdss  j0952 + 2143 @xmath73 years after the transient outburst , has faded by 1.2 mag since the _ galex _ detection on ut 2006 march 02 , and is likely associated with star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , we can derive the uv flux intrinsic to the transient detected by _",
    "galex _ to be @xmath74 mag , which corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath75  mag ( corrected for galactic extinction ) , 1.8 years after the onset of the transient outburst .",
    "our confirmation of transient uv emission associated with the event in 2006 march 2 contradicts the conclusions of @xcite , who found that it is not necessary to add a non - stellar component to fit the blue end of the sdss spectrum of sdss  j0952 + 2143 on 2005 december 30 , which we now know was taken 1.6 yr after the start of the uv / optical flare .",
    "note that a similar fading in the uv was detected in archival _ galex _ observations of ecle sdss j0748 + 4712 by @xcite , confirming that it too was powered by a uv - luminous event .    furthermore , the confirmation that the host galaxy is in fact a star - forming galaxy is important , since the continuum colors of the host galaxy measured by 2mass , wise and maia , all of which were taken either before the flare , or at least six years after the optical light curve reached its pre - flare level , and its narrow - line ratios measured in k08 , are ambiguous , and consistent with the regions populated by both agn and star - forming galaxies in the diagnostic diagrams @xcite .",
    "linear photometry spanning more than a decade does not exhibit behavior indicative of agn activity ( c.f .",
    "stability of the optical light curve in  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "this is corroborated by _",
    "xmm newton , swift bat , swift xrt _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observations , all of which were taken outside of the flaring phase ( with the slight exception of swift bat observations ) . only _ chandra _ observations detected low levels of soft x - rays , approximately 3.5 years after the start of the flare , and at a level well below that which is expected for normal agn .",
    "our recent _ swift _ photometry detected extended , persistent uv emission from sdss  j0952 + 2143 , an indication of ongoing star formation .",
    "given the fact that the swift photometry was acquired @xmath7611 years after the start of the flare , it is unlikely that there is a contribution to the late - time uv emission from the flare itself .",
    "these measurements provide a contigous observational baseline of approximately two years before the flare and ten years after the flare in which no activity characteristic of agn was detected .",
    "we also note that rass observations in nov 1990 did not detect significant x - ray emission ( yet an 11-year gap in observation exists between rass and xmm - newton observations ) .",
    "however , a longer baseline may be needed to definitively rule out an agn .",
    "seyfert 1.9 galaxy ic 3599 , for example , showed two bursting episodes caught by rosat and swift , respectively , separated by a time interval of 20 years .",
    "while the catalina sky survey data caught the second outburst in 2008 @xcite , it shows no significant variability ( @xmath77 mag ) in the linear data in the 6 years preceding it ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ic3599 ] ) .",
    "we do , however , note the difference in the lc shape of ic 3599 and sdss  j0952 + 2143 , the latter of which is asymmetric , shows more abrupt change in luminosity and has a larger optical amplitude ( approximately 0.2 mag in case of ic 3599 and 0.5 mag in case of sdss  j0952 + 2143 ) .",
    "thanks to the linear light curve , [ nii]/h@xmath8 and [ oiii]/h@xmath9 line ratios can now be used more safely in the context of bpt diagram , in which the host galaxy is placed in the sf region , but near the agn / sf division .",
    "similarly , 2mass , maia , sdss and wise color - color diagrams locate the host galaxy within the clusters occupied by agn and sf galaxies .",
    "motivated by these clues ( and by grond imaging that shows spiral structure in the host ( k09 ) ) , we conclude that the flare probably happened in a non - active , star forming galaxy .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the outburst in sdss  j0952 + 2143 : a tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole in the center of the host galaxy , an extreme type iin sn or agn - like variability .",
    "similarities in the spectral line responses of the former two scenarios require that we look at the photoionizing flare itself to ultimately uncover its origin . in figure",
    "[ fig : sne ] , we compare the linear difference imaging light curve converted to absolute magnitude , with the light curves of extreme interacting sne in the @xmath19-band ( sn 2003ma , @xcite ; sn 2006tf , @xcite ; sn 1988z , @xcite ; sn 2005ip , @xcite ) , and the best - observed tde candidate ps1 - 10jh @xcite . while the decline rate in the optical of 0.57 mag/(100 days ) at @xmath78 days from the start of the flare is similar to the behavior of sne 2003ma and 2006tf , this decline can also be fitted with a @xmath79 power - law evident in the optical light curve of ps1 - 10jh .",
    "maia photometry obtained @xmath7610 years after sdss photometry shows that largest change in brightness happened in the bluer bands ( @xmath801.3 mag and @xmath81 0.6 mag ) , indicating that the flare itself was much bluer than the host galaxy .",
    "the coronal line formation , however , was a response to intense x - ray radiation created by the event . since _",
    "spectrum was taken @xmath76 3.5 years after the peak of the flare it is reasonable to expect that the x - ray luminosity of sdss  j0952 + 2143 could have been orders of magnitude larger ( assuming the @xmath79 decay predicted for tdes ) .",
    "such high levels of x - ray luminosity are unusual for sne .",
    "the inferred uv luminosity for sdss  j0952 + 2143 at 1.8 yr after the start of the flare is comparable to the late - time uv luminosity inferred for tde candidate ps1 - 10jh at a similar phase @xcite , and much more luminous than would be expected for an interacting sn at such late times .",
    "uv observations of sne show a dramatic fading in the @xmath50 on the timescale of days to weeks @xcite , due to the expansion and cooling of the sn ejecta . even in interacting sne , sustained @xmath50 emission on the level observed for sdss  j0952 + 2143 on the timescale of 1.8 yr after explosion would be unprecedented .",
    "a possible explanation for the outburst in the sdss  j0952 + 2143  could be agn variability , such as an accretion disk instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thanks to the linear and catalina surveys , we are able to directly compare the optical light curve of sdss j0952 + 2143 to the light curve of the bursting agn ic 3599 .",
    "this comparison indicates a shorter rise times in sdss j925 + 2143 , more consistent with the tde scenario than a disk instability ( saxton et al . 2015 ) and a decline with the @xmath79 rate ( unlike the case of ic 3599 ) .",
    "furthermore , while the ionization lines up to [ fex ] have been reported in case of ic 3599 , the extreme coronal lines with ionization up to [ fexiv ] were not detected .",
    "we find that the reported x - ray and uv flux levels , combined with the light curves , suggest the agn scenario to be less likely than a tde for sdss j0952 + 2143 .",
    "however , a longer observational baseline of optical monitoring ( to be provided by e.g. pan - starrs , gaia , and lsst ) could shed more light on this question .",
    "interestingly , the peak optical luminosity of the transient is @xmath82 1 mag brighter than ps1 - 10jh @xcite , but in the range of some other optically - selected tde candidates reported in the literature @xcite . this could be attributed to a more energetic event , possibly resulting from the efficient accretion of a larger fraction of the bound stellar debris .",
    "this larger luminosity could also translate to a stronger light echo in its surrounding gaseous environment , thus resulting in a detectable ecle .",
    "given the optical luminosity of the host galaxy measured by _",
    "swift _ and the mercator telescope and its stellar velocity dispersion , a central black hole with a mass of @xmath83 @xcite is well within the range of black hole masses capable of disruption of a solar - type star outside the event horizon , and in a mass range where the peak accretion rate of the stellar debris would not be limited by the eddington luminosity of the central smbh .",
    "we present archival linear observations , and late - time swift and mercator observations , that add new pieces of the puzzle to the nature of the flare that powered the extreme coronal line emission in sdss  j0952 + 2143 .",
    "in particular , our observations reveal the blue color and strong late - time uv luminosity of the flare , and constrain its location within the errors to the nucleus of the host galaxy , both disfavoring a sn origin . furthermore ,",
    "if the flaring event is indeed associated with the galaxy s central smbh , then the lack of variability detected by linear before and after the flare is best explained by an impulsive accretion event , as would be expected from the tidal disruption of a star , as opposed to stochastic variability associated with a persistently accreting agn . in table 1",
    "we summarize the evidence for the nature of the flaring event that powered the light echo in sdss  j0952 + 2143 , and conclude that the most likely scenario that explains all of its properties is a tde .    lccc proximity to host core & y & u & y + uv luminosity & y & n & y + x - ray luminosity & y & u & n + lc shape & y & y & u    this case of sdss",
    "j0952 + 2143 demonstrates the importance of archived all - sky , time - domain surveys : linear was originally an asteroid survey that was recycled as a project searching for variable stars .",
    "however , this resulted in a highly valuable archival , decade long , time - domain survey covering a large fraction of the sky . in the future era of synoptic surveys",
    ", the recovery of the light curves of ecles discovered in spectroscopic surveys should be even easier , and allow one to relate the detailed energetics of the tde powering the flare , to its subsequent light echo in the gaseous environment of the smbh .",

    "<S> extreme coronal - line emitter ( ecle ) sdssj095209.56 + 214313.3 , known by its strong , fading , high ionization lines , has been a long standing candidate for a tidal disruption event , however a supernova origin has not yet been ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> here we add several new pieces of information to the puzzle of the nature of the transient that powered its variable coronal lines : 1 ) an optical light curve from the lincoln near earth asteroid research ( linear ) survey that serendipitously catches the optical flare , and 2 ) late - time observations of the host galaxy with the swift ultraviolet and optical telescope ( uvot ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the ground - based mercator telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the well - sampled , @xmath0-year long , unfiltered linear light curve constrains the onset of the flare to a precision of @xmath1 days and enables us to place a lower limit on the peak optical magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> difference imaging allows us to estimate the location of the flare in proximity of the host galaxy core . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the _ galex _ data ( early 2006 ) with the recently acquired swift uvot ( june 2015 ) and mercator observations ( april 2015 ) demonstrate a decrease in the uv flux over a @xmath2 year period , confirming that the flare was uv - bright . </S>",
    "<S> the long - lived uv - bright emission , detected 1.8 rest - frame years after the start of the flare , strongly disfavors a sn origin . </S>",
    "<S> these new data allow us to conclude that the flare was indeed powered by the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole and that tdes are in fact capable of powering the enigmatic class of ecles . </S>"
