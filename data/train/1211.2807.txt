    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are believed to originate in the death of massive stars ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , and are thus expected to trace star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the extreme luminosity of the prompt emission and the afterglow , grbs are a powerful probe of star formation in early times ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to establish the link between grbs and the cosmic star formation , it is important to understand the properties of the grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "a critical measurement is the star formation rates ( sfrs ) of the host galaxies .",
    "there exist various sfr indicators for high - redshift galaxies in different spectral windows .",
    "one key concern is the effect of dust extinction . even with arguably good extinction corrections in optical data , highly obscured components may still exist and would only appear at the far - infrared and radio wavelengths .",
    "the presence of such components would indicate a significant spatial variation in dust content in which case a global extinction correction would not apply . for grb host galaxies , systematic surveys were carried out to observe continuum emission in the radio @xcite and submillimeter @xcite frequency ranges for constraining dust enshrouded sfr .",
    "because of the synchrotron spectral slope , radio observations are only effective in detecting grb host galaxies at @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dust continuum emission in the submillimeter has a spectral slope that can nearly cancel the effect of luminosity distance from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , making the submillimeter wavelengths an effective window for detecting faint galaxies at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "however , the 850 @xmath13 m survey of 21 grb host galaxies at @xmath14 by @xcite using the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) only uncovered three host galaxies at @xmath15 confidence levels , and all three hosts are at @xmath16 .",
    "submillimeter single - dish telescopes are confusion limited at roughly a few mjy at 850 @xmath13 m , and therefore can only detect galaxies with infrared luminosities of @xmath17 ( 8 to 1000 @xmath13 m )  @xmath18 , or sfr @xmath19  yr@xmath8 .",
    "this sfr limit is much larger than the typical sfr of grb host galaxies measured in the optical @xcite .",
    "deeper submillimeter measurements are thus required to better constrain their infrared luminosity and the underlying sfr .",
    "a particularly interesting class of grb is `` dark grbs '' @xcite , defined by their faint optical afterglow , relative to the bright x - ray emission .",
    "a definition for dark bursts is those with the optical - to - x - ray spectral index of @xmath20 @xcite , which is physically motivated based on theoretical predictions of the synchrotron model .",
    "approximately 30%50% of long - duration grbs have suppressed optical fluxes relative to their x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the weaker optical emission can be caused by either intergalactic medium absorption at @xmath21 @xcite or dust extinction in their host galaxies @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", dark grbs may serve as a tracer of dust enshrouded star formation across cosmic time .",
    "however , uncertainty remains regarding whether the observed dust obscuration is representative of the global properties of the host galaxies or merely local to the progenitor site .",
    "this uncertainty can be addressed by comparing the rest - frame infrared luminosities between dark grb host galaxies and the rest of the host galaxy population .    in this _ letter _",
    ", we present initial results from a pilot study of grb host galaxies in the submillimeter frequency range using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) . in cycle 0 , we observed the host galaxies of grb021004 ( @xmath22 ) and grb080607 ( @xmath23 ) at 345 ghz .",
    "the grb fields were selected to have early - time afterglow spectra available for constraining the ism absorption properties of the host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are among the best studied events and they represent two extremes in the integrated total ism column density alone the afterglow line of sight .",
    "grb021004 is one of a few grbs arising in a lyman limit absorber with @xmath24 @xmath25 , and the host of grb080607 is a damped ly@xmath26 absorber with an unprecedentedly high gas density of @xmath27 @xmath25 .",
    "grb080607 is a dark burst with highly extinguished afterglow ( @xmath28 , @xcite ) , and the extinction suggests that the host galaxy may have detectable submillimeter dust emission .",
    "the host galaxies of the two grbs are found to have optical sfrs of 1040 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 @xcite , consistent with normal star forming galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "here we use the alma results to estimate the infrared luminosities of the two host galaxies , and to examine whether there exist highly obscured star - forming regions that are not revealed by optical observations .",
    "we describe our alma observations and data reduction in section  [ obs ] , and the results and estimate the infrared luminosities and the sfrs of the grb host galaxies in section  [ result ] .",
    "the implication of our observations is discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters of @xmath29 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , and we convert the previous results to this set of cosmology .",
    "observations of the continuum emission at 345 ghz from the host galaxies of grb021004 and grb080607 ware obtained using the alma 12-m array .",
    "four spectral windows were tuned to center at 338 , 340 , 350 , and 352 ghz , each with a 2 ghz bandwidth .",
    "bandpass calibrators and flux calibrators were observed prior to the observations of the science targets .",
    "bright quasars near the grb fields were observed every @xmath32 minutes for phase and amplitude calibrations . for each science target , a total of 0.70.8 hr of on - target integration was collected .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the basic observing parameters and the various calibrators .",
    "we received the data from the joint alma observatory ( jao ) a few weeks after the observations .",
    "the delivered data were already bandpass , flux , and gain ( phase and amplitude ) calibrated by jao , and reference images were also provided .",
    "all the above calibration and imaging were carried out using common astronomy software applications ( casa , * ? ? ?",
    "we further inspected the jao calibration in casa , and fourier - transformed the complex visibility to make our own images . to obtain the highest s / n , we gave all visibility data equal weights regardless of their density distribution in the @xmath33 plane ( i.e. , `` natural weighting '' ) .",
    "the resulting synthesized beams and sensitivities are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "@xcite improved the previous scuba result slightly to @xmath41 mjy .",
    "our measurement is @xmath42 deeper than these previous observations but the host galaxy remains undetected .",
    "given the redshift of @xmath22 and adopting the 3-@xmath5 upper limit of 0.33 mjy , we can estimate the upper limits of its rest - frame infrared luminosity and sfr . to do so with single - band photometry",
    ", we need to assume a dust temperature , and this can be done using the infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) library of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafer ce01 ) .",
    "the seds in ce01 are luminosity dependent ( based on a locally calibrated luminosity  dust temperature relation ) and do not allow for scaling of the seds .",
    "the library contains a broad range of infrared luminosity , from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , and each template has its unique dust temperature .",
    "we thus redshift the ce01 seds to @xmath22 and look for those with observed 345 ghz fluxes below our upper limit . of the 105 templates provided by ce01 , 65 have 345 ghz fluxes lower than 0.33 mjy ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , with corresponding infrared luminosities between @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 . an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg , @xmath48 )",
    "is clearly ruled out for the host of grb021004 , which can be at most a modest infrared luminous galaxy of @xmath49 @xmath47 . combining available optical photometric measurements ( open squares in figure  [ fig2 ] ) with the alma upper limit",
    "further reveals a blue sed that is inconsistent with any of the ce01 templates , suggesting that the host of grb021004 contains primarily young stars with little dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the infrared luminosity may be substantially lower than the observed limit . if we adopt the sfr conversion of star - forming galaxies , sfr ( @xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) @xmath50 @xmath51 @xcite , then the 3-@xmath5 upper limit of the sfr of the host galaxy is 53 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "@xcite obtained an optical spectrum of the early - time afterglow of grb021004 .",
    "the authors estimated an unobscured sfr of @xmath52 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 based on the observed h@xmath26 flux .",
    "@xcite obtained a ly@xmath26 spectrum of the host galaxy and estimated an sfr of @xmath32 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 , but this is uncertain because of the complex radiative transfer of ly@xmath26 .",
    "both results are within our 3-@xmath5 upper limit .",
    "the alma imaging observation confirms the low sfr of the host galaxy , and also shows that more sensitive , multi - wavelength alma submillimeter imaging is needed to constrain the infrared luminosity and dust sed of this object .",
    "a significant 345 ghz flux is detected at the location of grb080607 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows our alma image of the field around grb080607 , and its 345 ghz flux contours overlaid on an _ hst _",
    "wfc3 f160w image .",
    "the rms noise is measured to be 0.094 mjy beam@xmath8 within the primary beam .",
    "there exists a peak of 345 ghz emission at the location of the host galaxy , with a peak flux of 0.27 mjy beam@xmath8 .",
    "we measure a flux of 0.31 mjy by fitting the emission with a point - source model . on the other hand ,",
    "the contours in figure  [ fig1 ] suggest that the emission is elongated , and the elongation is similar to that observed in the _ hst _ image .",
    "we therefore also fit the emission with an extended 2-d gaussian , and obtain a slightly higher integrated flux of 0.32 mjy .",
    "the fitted gaussian is still consistent with a point source , which is not surprising given the low s / n . in the subsequent analyses",
    ", we adopt the more conservative measurement of 0.31 mjy with a statistical significance of 3.3 @xmath5 .",
    "approximately @xmath53 south of the grb host galaxy , a marginal ( @xmath54 ) submillimeter emission is also detected at an optically bright absorber at @xmath55 ( h .- w .",
    "chen et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "we do not give further consideration to this object in this paper , but we note that this absorber could also be a faint submillimeter source .",
    "the key question here is whether we can consider the @xmath56 emission as a detection of the grb host galaxy .",
    "first , the fitted 345 ghz peak in both the point - source and the gaussian cases has an offset of @xmath57 from the centroid of the optical emission .",
    "this offset is negligible given the s / n and the synthesized beam size of @xmath58 .",
    "thus the confidence of the detection is enhanced by its coincident position with the grb host galaxy .",
    "second , we consider the probability for this peak to be spurious .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the histogram of pixel brightness in the primary beam .",
    "the distribution can be well fitted with a gaussian with @xmath59 mjy beam@xmath8 ( solid curve ) , consistent with our measured noise of 0.094 mjy beam@xmath8 ( dotted curve ) . following the gaussian distribution function ,",
    "the probability of finding a @xmath60 noise spike is @xmath61 .",
    "however , there are hints of a non - gaussian noise .",
    "the histogram in figure  [ fig3 ] suggests an excess of positive pixels ( at @xmath62 mjy ) . in the image",
    "( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , additional to the grb host galaxy , there is a second @xmath60 spike to the north - east of the grb host , which has no known optical counterpart . within the alma primary beam ( fwhm = @xmath63 )",
    ", there are approximately 220 independent resolution elements .",
    "this additional @xmath60 spike suggests a probability of @xmath64 , which is @xmath42 higher than the gaussian probability .",
    "this is an upper limit , since we can not rule out this spike as a real submillimeter source .",
    "thus the probability of finding a @xmath60 spike at the location of our target is between @xmath61 ( assuming a gaussian noise ) and @xmath65 ( assuming that the second 3.3 @xmath5 spike is due to noise ) .",
    "both these values are sufficiently small .",
    "therefore , the fact that the observed emission coincides with the position of the grb host substantially increases the confidence level of the detection of the host . in this paper",
    ", we consider this a detection , but we also point out that it will be worthwhile to confirm this with alma in future larger grb host galaxy surveys .    with the above measured flux and the redshift of @xmath23 , we then estimate the infrared luminosity of the host galaxy of grb080607 , using the ce01 library .",
    "we redshift the ce01 templates to @xmath23 and find seven of the 105 templates fall in the observed range of @xmath66 mjy ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) , with @xmath67 to @xmath68 @xmath47 . including available optical and near - infrared photometric measurements",
    ", the bottom panel of figure  [ fig2 ] further shows that the sed is well represented by known dusty templates of local galaxies across the full spectral range .",
    "the agreement strongly supports the conclusion that the host galaxy of grb080607 is similar to a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg , @xmath69 ) in the local universe .",
    "the inferred sfr is between 41 and 77 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 .",
    "the above results are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "@xcite presented sed fitting for the host of grb080607 at @xmath704 @xmath13 m . adopting a milky - way type dust extinction law , they found @xmath71 and an extinction corrected sfr of @xmath7224 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 , roughly @xmath73 lower than the submillimeter sfr .",
    "given known uncertainties in both the optical extinction correction and the infrared sed of galaxies and possible variation in the distribution of dust content , the factor of three difference between the optical and submillimeter sfrs only suggests a modest amount of dust enshrouded star formation .",

    "with the pilot alma imaging program of two grb host galaxies at @xmath0 , we attempt to constrain the far - infrared properties of grb host galaxies . in our sample",
    ", grb021004 has a very bright afterglow , but the host galaxy does not appear to show unusual dust content . on the other hand , grb080607 is a dark grb with large extinction along the line of sight .",
    "their host galaxies have measured 345 ghz fluxes of @xmath39 and @xmath77 mjy , respectively .",
    "statistically , we can not rule out the possibility that the two host galaxies have comparable submillimeter fluxes . despite",
    "that we had already pushed the sensitivities to roughly an order of magnitude deeper than previous measurements , deeper alma observations ( and a larger sample ) are clearly needed to tell the difference between the host galaxies of typical and dark grbs .    on the other hand , the alma sensitivity limit is deep enough to probe beyond the ulirg regime .",
    "@xcite suggest that the high - redshift infrared luminous galaxy population contributes to the grb host galaxy population .",
    "the alma sensitivity thus allows us to examine whether the two host galaxies are similar to typical dusty galaxies selected by submillimeter telescopes ( submillimeter galaxies , hereafter smgs ) .",
    "first , it is established that bright 345 ghz selected smgs primarily reside in the redshift range of @xmath783.5 @xcite .",
    "the host galaxies of grb021004 and grb080607 have redshifts in the range of these bright smgs .",
    "the integrated source counts indicate that bright smgs of @xmath79 mjy contribute to @xmath80 of the extragalactic background light in this wavelength range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "faint - end counts derived from lensing cluster surveys indicate that approximately 50% of the background arises from fainter sources in the flux range of @xmath812 mjy @xcite .",
    "our alma detection and tight upper limit on the host galaxies of grb021004 and grb080607 thus put them at the still fainter end of the 345 ghz population .",
    "we further compare the two grb host galaxies with normal star forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "there exists a correlation between sfr and stellar mass of star forming galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this correlation is often referred to as the star formation `` main sequence '' of galaxies .",
    "galaxies at the main sequence are suggested to be disks that undergo quasi - steady star formation , and outliers are suggested to be starbursts with star formation boosted by gas - rich mergers @xcite . for @xmath82",
    ", @xcite found sfr = 200 @xmath83 ( @xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) for main - sequence galaxies , where @xmath84 is stellar mass in units of @xmath85 .",
    "the host galaxy of grb021004 has estimated stellar masses of @xmath86 @xcite and @xmath87 @xcite . with our alma sfr upper limit ( @xmath88 ) of 53 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 , its sfr/@xmath83 has values of @xmath89 or @xmath90 , depending on the adopted stellar mass .",
    "the former is consistent with main - sequence galaxies , while the latter is close to a starburst .",
    "however , both values are 3-@xmath5 upper limits .",
    "the host galaxy of grb080607 has a better constrained stellar mass of 13 @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "if we adopt our alma sfr of 4177 @xmath7 yr@xmath8 , then it has sfr/@xmath92600 .",
    "this exercise shows that both grb host galaxies are consistent with being main - sequence star - forming galaxies .",
    "finally , the afterglow spectrum of grb080607 shows a fairly large dust extinction of @xmath93 , and unprecedentedly high gas densities of @xmath27 @xmath25 and @xmath94 @xmath25 , with a warm co excitation temperature of @xmath95 k @xcite .",
    "however , prochaska et al . also suggest that the intervening molecular cloud is not the birth place of the grb .",
    "the extinction in the afterglow is significantly larger than that for the host galaxy ( @xmath96 , @xcite ) .",
    "all the above , together with our alma result of a relatively normal sfr , indicates that grb080607 is not in a rare dusty galaxy , but the sightline happens to pass through a molecular cloud in its host galaxy .",

    "<S> we report 345 ghz continuum observations of the host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) 021004 and 080607 at @xmath0 using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) in cycle 0 . </S>",
    "<S> of the two bursts , grb021004 is one of the few grbs that originates in a lyman limit host , while grb080607 is classified as a `` dark burst '' and its host galaxy is a candidate of dusty star forming galaxy at @xmath1 . with an order of magnitude improvement in the sensitivities of the new imaging searches , </S>",
    "<S> we detect the host galaxy of grb080607 with a flux of @xmath2 mjy and a corresponding infrared luminosity of @xmath3@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the host galaxy of grb021004 remains undetected and the alma observations allow us to place a 3-@xmath5 upper limit of @xmath6 for the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum imaging observations show that the two galaxies are not ultraluminous infrared galaxies but are at the faintest end of the dusty galaxy population that gives rise to the submillimeter extragalactic background light . </S>",
    "<S> the derived star formation rates of the two grb host galaxies are less than 100 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , which are broadly consistent with optical measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the result suggests that the large extinction ( @xmath9 ) in the afterglow of grb080607 is confined along its particularly dusty sightline , and not representative of the global properties of the host galaxy . </S>"
