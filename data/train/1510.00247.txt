    "<S> harnessing the power of low - dimensional materials in thermal applications calls for a solid understanding of the anomalous thermal properties of such systems . we analyze thermal conduction in one - dimensional systems by determining the frequency - dependent phonon mean free paths ( mfps ) for an anharmonic chain , delivering insight into the diverging thermal conductivity observed in computer simulations . in our approach , </S>",
    "<S> the mfps are extracted from the length - dependence of the spectral heat current obtained from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations . at low frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> the results reveal a power - law dependence of the mfps on frequency , in agreement with the diverging conductivity and the recently determined equilibrium mfps . at higher frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> however , the nonequilibrium mfps consistently exceed the equilibrium mfps , highlighting the differences between the two quantities . </S>",
    "<S> exerting pressure on the chain is shown to suppress the mean free paths and to generate a weaker divergence of mfps at low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the results deliver important insight into anomalous thermal conduction in low - dimensional systems and also reveal differences between the mfps obtained from equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations . </S>"
