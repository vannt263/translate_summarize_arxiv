    "a defect - free infinite crystal becomes mechanically unstable at a stress with a corresponding critical strain .",
    "such a stress is the ideal strength of a material which is an inherent property of a given atomic and electronic structure as well as a natural upper bound on its strength  @xcite .",
    "while the variation of electron density can alter ideal strength of some materials  @xcite , those manipulations usually involve stoichiometric change which may alter the nature of chemical bonding between atoms in crystal . in this",
    "regard , graphene , a two - dimensional crystal with atomic thickness , is an ideal material to investigate electronic control of ideal strength because it allows very high level of charge doping without any sacrifice of atomic integrity through either field - effect transistor setups  @xcite or alkali metal depositions  @xcite .",
    "although there have been many studies about effects of mechanical perturbation on electron physics in graphene  @xcite , the effect of electron density variation on the mechanical properties of graphene has not been known yet .",
    "graphene is also known to be the strongest two dimensional ( 2d ) material  @xcite and can maintain its strength in the presence of grain boundaries  @xcite .",
    "a recent nanoindentation experiment  @xcite reports that the intrinsic strength of graphene is 42 n m@xmath0 at the nominal equibiaxial breaking strain of 0.225 .",
    "this was followed by a theoretical calculation  @xcite showing the quite smaller breaking strain of 0.15 than the measured value .",
    "it is unusual since materials under strain typically fail before they reach the ideal strength due to various reasons .",
    "therefore considerations on the other external effects such as a doping are called for to understand the ideal strength of graphene further since typical graphene samples in experiments are doped .    in this work ,",
    "we report a theoretical study showing that graphene under equibiaxial strain becomes to be stronger as doping increases with both electron and hole doping .",
    "though the ideal strength under equibiaxial strain increases slightly by @xmath1 depending on doping type and amounts , the corresponding critical breaking strain increases dramatically by @xmath2 within the doping level of @xmath3 which is accessible in experiments  @xcite . we show that the failure of isotropically expanded graphene through the @xmath4 phonon mode softening  @xcite or the two - dimensional peierls instability  @xcite is overcome by doping because the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) of doped graphene lies outside the energy gap associated with the @xmath4 phonon . on the contrary , under uniaxial strain invoking elastic failure of graphene  @xcite , we find that electron doping weakens graphene by @xmath6 while hole doping strengthens one by @xmath7 and that the corresponding breaking strains also change a lot by @xmath8 within similar doping levels for the equibiaxial strain cases .",
    "because the elastic failure under uniaxial strain is associated with occupation of the @xmath9 band  @xcite , the asymmetric dependence of ideal strength on electron and hole doping can be explained in term of doping induced occupation ( electron doping ) or depopulaton ( hole doping ) of the @xmath9 band of uniaxially strained graphene .",
