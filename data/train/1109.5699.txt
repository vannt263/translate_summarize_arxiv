    "@xcite computed several type  ii cepheid models , including bl  her models .",
    "one of their models revealed oscillations with alternating amplitude and period .",
    "a large and systematic survey of the radiative bl  her models was conducted by @xcite and @xcite . in most of their model sequences @xcite found narrow windows of parameters for which the light and radial velocity curves exhibited a periodic alternations of deep and shallow minima  the period doubling effect .",
    "the origin of the period doubling in hydrodynamic models was traced by @xcite to the destabilising role of the half - integer resonances , @xmath5 , between the fundamental mode and the higher order overtones .",
    "close to the resonance centre period - doubling bifurcation can occur : the fundamental mode limit cycle becomes unstable , and period - two solution , with alternating shape of the light and radial velocity curves can emerge .",

    "@xcite concluded that period doubling effect , not observed in any bl her star at that time , should be eventually found .",
    "more recently , @xcite conducted a large survey of bl  her - type convective models , however none of their models exhibited period doubling .",

    "it is visible that changes in the location of resonant lines are rather small , but systematics is clear .",
    "considering e.g. the 3:2 resonance and its crossing with @xmath57d line , one observe that larger the mass ( at fixed @xmath62 ) lower the luminosity and lower the effective temperature at the crossing . the same tendency is observed with the increasing metallicity ( at fixed mass ) .",
    "the largest possible luminosity at the crossing is @xmath63 at @xmath64k ( @xmath3 , @xmath51 ) , while the lowest possible luminosity is @xmath65 at @xmath66k ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "we note that model periods depend only weakly on the convective parameters of the models .",
    "sensitivity is larger for the period ratios and thus , also for the location of the resonant lines . the quantitative picture arising from figs  [ fig.diags ] and [ fig.diag5 ] however , is the same for other sets of convective parameters , in particular for sets p2  and p3  considered in this study .",
    "linear computations show , that at least several half - integer resonances can play a role in destabilising the fundamental mode and giving rise to the period doubling behaviour in a models with fundamental mode period of @xmath69d .",

    "[ fig.a ] ) , the pulsation amplitude , @xmath90 , and the amplitude of period doubling , @xmath79 .",
    "one could choose the fourier phases instead ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) , which little depend on the pulsation amplitudes and are also not so sensitive to the values of convective parameters @xcite .",
    "we note however , that one of the known problems in modelling the light curves with pulsation hydrocodes is that computed fourier phases are systematically different from the observed phases .",
    "the problem was studied in more detail in the rr lyrae stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was also encountered in the radiative and convective models of classical cepheids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in radiative models of bl  her stars @xcite .",
    "origin of the discrepancy is not clear , although the very simplified treatment of the radiation transfer in the subphotospheric layers of all current hydrocodes is the most likely culprit @xcite .",
    "consequently we choose to focus on the amplitudes first , even though they depend on the convective parameters of the models stronger , and in the next step , we compare the fourier phases and amplitude ratios .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.a ] we observe that in almost all model sequences the period doubling domain is present . only for three model sequences ,",
    "all with the largest considered metallicity ( @xmath68 , and @xmath94 ) , and adopting convective parameters of set p2 , period doubling is not present .",
    "the other striking feature visible in fig .",
    "[ fig.a ] are large amplitudes of the period doubling as compared to blg184.7133264  and , at the same time , significantly lower pulsation amplitudes , @xmath90 .",
    "the systematics is clear .",
    "lower the mass and higher the metallicity of the models , higher the pulsation amplitude and lower the amplitude of period doubling . only for the largest metallicity ( @xmath68 ) we can match the pulsation amplitude of blg184.7133264  ( for sets p1  and p3 ) .",
    "also for the most metal rich model sequences the amplitude of period doubling is comparable to what we observe in blg184.7133264 . for lower metallicity models ( @xmath54 and",
    "@xmath51 ) the period doubling amplitude is much higher through the whole period doubling domain and matches the amplitude of blg184.7133264  only at the domain edges .",
    "the large amplitude of period doubling in our models and rather wide range of luminosities over which period doubling domains extend ( typically @xmath95 ) is somewhat surprising .",
    "this suggests that the period doubling should be a rather common feature of bl  her stars with periods around @xmath69d , which is not the case .",
    "we will address this problem later in section  [ sec.discussion ] .",
    "the above analysis of model amplitudes points that blg184.7133264  should be of high metallicity .",
    "then , we can simultaneously match its pulsation amplitude and the amplitude of period doubling .",
    "this is a likely possibility , as many bl  her stars have high metallicities ( see discussion in section  [ sec.discussion ] ) .",
    "however , one have to remember that model amplitudes depend on the convective parameters adopted in the computations , in particular on the mixing length and on the eddy - viscosity parameter .",
    "comparison of the model results for sets p1  and p2  reveals the effect of changing the mixing length parameter ( while keeping all other convective parameters fixed ) .",
    "mixing length is equal to @xmath96 in our basic set p1  and is larger in set p2  ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the effect is clear , by increasing the mixing length the pulsation amplitude decreases as well as the amplitude of period doubling ( which vanish for @xmath68 and three largest considered masses , fig .",
    "[ fig.a ] ) .",
    "it seems that one can match the pulsation amplitude of blg184.7133264  also for lower metallicities by the decrease of the mixing length below the value adopted in set p1  ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "however at the same time the amplitude of period doubling , which is already very large , would increase even more .",
    "also values of the mixing length below @xmath96 seem too small , typical values used in model computations being around @xmath99 .",
    "recent numerical simulations point to even larger values @xcite .    mixing length parameter",
    "is usually fixed in model computations and it is the eddy viscosity parameter , which is commonly used to adjust the pulsation amplitudes in the convective models .",
    "it regulates the amount of viscous dissipation in the model and is a physically motivated counterpart of the artificial viscosity in the radiative models .",
    "pulsation amplitudes of rr  lyrae and cepheid models clearly depend on that parameter ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "lower the eddy - viscous dissipation larger the pulsation amplitude .",
    "also the existence and the amplitude of the period doubling computed in the convective rr  lyrae models by @xcite depend on the eddy viscosity parameter .",
    "again , lower the eddy - viscous dissipation larger the amplitude of the period doubling in case of the rr  lyrae models . to match the pulsation amplitude of blg184.7133264  for metallicities lower than @xmath68 one has to decrease the eddy viscosity , which will also increase the amplitude of period doubling .    to test the effect of decreasing the eddy - viscosity parameter",
    "we have computed two additional model sequences , both with @xmath53 and @xmath51 , and with eddy - viscosity parameter equal to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "we note that further decrease of eddy viscosity is not easy .",
    "already with @xmath100 pulsation become very violent and we start to face the convergence difficulties .",
    "it is clear that amplitude of alternations strongly increase with the decreasing eddy viscosity parameter .",
    "however pulsation amplitude increased only very weakly  much too small to match the amplitude of blg184.7133264 .",
    "changes of the other convective parameters also affect the pulsation amplitudes which is usually compensated by the change of the eddy viscosity parameter .",
    "this is what we have done in set p3 , in which we consider the radiative cooling of the convective elements .",
    "inclusion of radiative cooling makes the convection less efficient .",
    "consequently the pulsation amplitudes increase which has to be compensated with the larger value of the eddy viscosity parameter . for the model sequences adopting convective parameters of set p3",
    "we get the period doubling amplitudes higher than for set p2  and similar to that of set p1 .",
    "the pulsation amplitudes , @xmath90 , are similar as in set p2 .",

    "in the first scenario , the star crosses the instability strip once and evolves away up along the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "this is the scenario which one can also see in figs  [ fig.evba ] and [ fig.evda ] . in the second scenario , so called ` bluenose ' is possible .",

    "the model light curves were transformed into the @xmath9-band and compared with the observed light curve of blg184.7133264 .",
    "this was done with the intermediary of the fourier decomposition parameters .",
    "we were able to match the observed pulsation amplitude and the amplitude of the period doubling only for relatively high metallicity , @xmath68 . for three considered model masses , @xmath70 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the model light curves",
    "reproduce the observed light curve quite well ( fig .",
    "[ fig.lcc ] ) .",
    "low order fourier parameters , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are reproduced satisfactorily ( particularly for @xmath84 ) .",
    "also the secondary features of the light curve , in particular the pronounced bump at the minimum light are qualitatively reproduced .",
    "only the lowest mass model ( @xmath3 ) agree with the stellar evolution theory . for @xmath68 evolutionary tracks for models of @xmath146 run well beyond the red edge of the bl  her domain . consequently , our best estimates for the parameters of blg184.7133264  are those of model a ( table  [ tab.models ] ) , specifically @xmath68 , @xmath3 and @xmath147 .    how robust are these estimates ?",
    "uncertainties lie in both the pulsation theory and in the evolution theory .",
    "our conclusion about the high metallicity of blg184.7133264  is based on the pulsation amplitudes of the computed models .",
    "these depend on the adopted convective parameters , in particular on the mixing - length parameter , @xmath135 , and the eddy viscosity parameter , @xmath148 . as we discussed in section  [ sec.lcc ] , change of these parameters",
    "is not likely to affect our results strongly .",
    "nevertheless , more extensive model survey , including the variation of other parameters of the turbulent convection model , is needed and planned .",
    "in particular , the effect of including the turbulent pressure should be examined .",
    "derived metallicity can , in principle , be larger than @xmath68 , but only slightly . in test computations with @xmath149 and assuming convective parameters of set p1",
    ", we find no traces of period doubling behaviour ( independently of the model mass ) .    at first glance ,",
    "metallicity of order of @xmath68 may seem too high for the population  ii object .",
    "the metal rich stars , however , are not exceptional in the galactic bulge .",

    "spectroscopic metallicity determinations , available mostly for bright k and m giants and red clump stars , indicate a large spread of metallicities in the bulge , too , with @xmath143}$ ] varying from @xmath152 to @xmath153 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent review ) .",
    "@xmath143}$ ] determination for several main sequence stars in the bulge was also possible , during the microlensing events @xcite .",
    "for these stars , metallicity range form @xmath154 to @xmath153 .",
    "metallicity can also be estimated for the rr lyrae stars pulsating simultaneously in the fundamental and the first overtone modes ( rrd stars ) .",
    "the oiii - cvs @xcite lists several bulge rrd stars with unusually short periods and low period ratios , down to @xmath155d and @xmath156 .",
    "the existence of these stars may be explained by high metal abundances , up to @xmath143}\\approx -0.36 $ ] . as @xmath68 corresponds to @xmath143}\\approx-0.27 $ ] , we see that our estimate of metallicity of blg184.7133264  is not unreasonable .    for the luminosity , we can firmly indicate its lower limit .",
    "the period doubling domain in the hr diagram always coincide with the crossing of the 3:2 resonant line with the @xmath57d line .",
    "run of the two lines shows very little sensitivity to the values of the convective parameters ( section  [ sec.linear ] ) , as well as to the mass and metallicity of the models ( fig .",
    "[ fig.diag5 ] ) .",
    "the lowest luminosity at which the crossing occurs is @xmath157 .",
    "based on the recent evolutionary tracks , we have constrained the mass of blg184.7133264 .",
    "with metallicity of @xmath68 only the models in a narrow mass range of @xmath158 evolve through the bl  her pulsation domain .",
    "we get the best match with the pulsation models for @xmath3 .",
    "we note however , that at @xmath68 the evolutionary tracks that cross the bl  her domain vary rapidly with mass of the models .",
    "although the current evolutionary tracks of several groups lead to the same conclusions ( section  [ sec.evol ] ) , the systematic errors in the micro - physics ( e.g. opacities ) or in the treatment of physical phenomena ( e.g. convection , rotation , mass loss ) may effect the results of evolutionary computations and somewhat change the best matching mass for blg184.7133264 .",
    "hydrodynamic model surveys ( * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) indicate that period doubling phenomenon should be a rather common property of the bl  her stars , at least of those with periods close to @xmath69d .",
    "@xcite found the period doubling behaviour in a period range of @xmath159d . predicted amplitudes of alternations",
    "are usually large , much larger than observed in blg184.7133264 .",
    "thus , alternations should be easily detectable .",
    "currently , around 250 bl  her variables are known ; 55 stars are listed in gcvs @xcite and close to 200 in oiii - cvs ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , in prep . ) .",
    "ogle observations are accurate enough to discover alternations with amplitudes as low as a few mmag .",
    "hence , it is somewhat surprising that blg184.7133264  is , at the moment , the only bl  her star with firmly detected period doubling behaviour .",
    "we note , that our strong period doubling candidate , blg189.6137529 , also has a period in the expected range . on the other hand , only few of the known bl  her stars have periods close to 2.4d .",
    "our study shows that higher metallicity ( e.g. close to solar , which may not be exceptional for bl  her stars ) may inhibit the period doubling effect .",
    "definitely , more detailed non - linear study is needed .    in the forthcoming paper",
    "we plan to study the full grid of models , covering the whole bl  her domain in the hr diagram , not only the 2.4d models",
    ". such survey will reveal the structure of the period doubling domain in the hr diagram , in particular the periods at which the phenomenon is possible and factors which control the existence and strength of the period doubling effect .",
