    "the explosive growth of the social web hints at collective problem - solving made possible when people have tools to connect , create and organize information on a massive scale .",
    "the social news aggregator digg , for example , allows people to collectively identify interesting news stories .",
    "the microblogging service twitter has created a cottage industry of third - party applications , such as identifying trends from the millions of conversations taking place on the site and notifying you when your friends are nearby .",
    "other sites enable people to collectively create encyclopedias , develop software , and invest in social causes . analyzing records of complex social activity can help identify communities and important individuals within them , suggest relevant readings , and identify events and trends .",
    "effective use of this technology requires understanding how the social dynamics emerges from the decisions made by interconnected individuals .",
    "one approach is a stochastic modeling framework , which represents each user as a stochastic process with a few states . as an example , applying this approach to digg successfully described observed voting patterns of digg s users  @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative evaluation of the model was limited by the poor quality of data , which was extracted by scraping digg s web pages .",
    "in this paper we present two refinements to this modeling approach for digg .",
    "first , we explicitly allow for systematic differences in _",
    "interest _ in news stories for linked and unlinked users .",
    "this distinction is a key aspect of social media where links indicate commonality of user interests .",
    "we also include additional aspects of the digg user interface in the model , thereby accounting for cases where the existing model identified anomalous behaviors .",
    "as the second major contribution , we describe how to measure confidence intervals of model predictions .",
    "we show that confidence intervals are highly correlated with the error between the predicted and actual votes stories accrue .",
    "thus the confidence intervals indicate the quality of the model s predictions on a per - user or per - story basis .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes digg and our data set .",
    "we then present a stochastic model of user behavior on digg that explicitly includes dependencies on social network links . using this model",
    ", we quantify these dependencies and discuss how the model predicts eventual popularity of newly submitted content .",
    "finally , we compare our approach with other studies and discuss possible applications of stochastic models incorporating social network structure .",
    "[ sect.digg ] at the time data was collected , digg was a popular news portal with over 3 million registered users .",
    "digg allowed users to submit and rate news stories by voting on , or ` digging ' , them .",
    "every day digg promoted a small fraction of submitted stories to the highly visible _ front page_. although the exact promotion mechanism was kept secret and changes occasionally , it appears to use the number of votes the story receives .",
    "digg s popularity was largely due to the emergent front page created by the collective decisions of its many users .",
    "below we describe the user interface that existed at the time of data collection .",
    "submitted stories appear in the _ upcoming _ stories list , where they remain for about 24 hours or until promoted to the front page . by default ,",
    "digg shows upcoming and front page stories in recency lists i.e. , in reverse chronological order with the most recently submitted ( promoted ) story at the top of the list .",
    "a user may choose to display stories by popularity or by some broad topic .",
    "popularity lists show stories with the most votes up to that time , e.g. , the most popular stories submitted ( promoted ) in the past day or week .",
    "each list is divided into pages , with 15 stories on each page , and the user has to click to see subsequent pages .",
    "digg allows users to designate friends and track their activities .",
    "the friend relationship is asymmetric . when user @xmath0 lists user @xmath1 as a _",
    ", @xmath0 can follow the activities of @xmath1 but not vice versa .",
    "we call @xmath0 the _ fan _ , or follower , of @xmath1 .",
    "the _ friends interface _ shows users the stories their friends recently submitted or voted for .    in this paper , we focus on the recency and `` popular in the last 24 hours '' lists for all stories and the friends interface list for each user .",
    "these lists appear to account for most of the votes a story receives .",
    "[ fig.vote example ]    most digg users focus on front page stories , so upcoming stories accrue votes slowly .",
    "when a story is promoted to the front page , it becomes visible to many more users and accrues votes rapidly .",
    "[ fig.vote example ] shows the evolution of the number of votes for a story submitted in june 2009 .",
    "the slope abruptly increases at promotion time ( dashed line ) . as the story ages , accumulation of new votes slows down , and after a few days stories typically no longer receive new votes .",
    "the final number of votes varies widely among the stories .",
    "some promoted stories accumulate thousands of votes , while others muster only a few hundred .",
    "stories that are never promoted receive few votes , in many cases just a single vote from the submitter , and are removed after about 24 hours .    a challenge for understanding this variation in popularity is the interaction between the stories _ visibility _ ( how digg displays them ) and their _ interestingness _ to users .",
    "models accounting for the structure of the digg interface can help distinguish these contributions to story popularity .",
    "we used digg api to collect complete ( as of july 2 , 2009 ) voting histories of all stories promoted to the front page of digg in june 2009.lerman/downloads/digg2009.html ] for each story , we collected story i d , submitter s i d , and the list of voters with the time of each vote .",
    "we also collected the time each story was promoted to the front page .",
    "the data set contains over 3 million votes on 3,553 promoted stories .",
    "we did not retrieve data about stories that were submitted to digg during that time period but were never promoted .",
    "thus our focus is on the behavior of promoted stories , which receive most of the attention from digg users .",
    "we define an _ active user _ as any user who voted for at least one story on digg during the data collection period . of the 139,409 active users , 71,367 designated at least one other user as a friend .",
    "we extracted the friends of these users and reconstructed the fan network of active users , i.e. , a directed graph of active users who are following activities of other users .    over the period of a month , some of the voters in our sample deleted their accounts and were marked `` inactive '' by digg .",
    "such cases represent a tiny fraction of all users in the data set ; therefore , we take the number of users to be constant .",
    "[ fig.digg time ]    activity on digg varies considerably over the course of a day , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.digg time ] .",
    "adjusting times by the cumulative activity on the site accounts for this variation and improves predictions .",
    "following  @xcite we define the `` digg time '' between two events ( e.g. , votes on a story ) as the total number of votes made during the time between those events . with our data ,",
    "this only counts votes on stories that were eventually promoted to the front page . in our data",
    "set , there are on average about 4000 votes on front page stories per hour , with a range of about a factor of 3 in this rate during the course of a day .",
    "this behavior is similar to that seen in an extensive study of front page activity in 2007  @xcite , and as in that study we scale the measure by defining a `` digg hour '' to be the average number of front page votes in an hour .",
    "a key challenge in stochastic modeling is finding a useful combination of simplicity , accuracy and available data to calibrate the model .",
    "stochastic models of online social media describe the joint behavior of their users and content .",
    "since these web sites receive much more content than users have time or interest to examine , one important property to model is how readily users can find content .",
    "a second key property is how users react to content once they find it .",
    "thus an important modeling choice for social media is the level of detail sufficient to distinguish user behavior and content visibility . following the practice of population dynamics  @xcite and epidemic modeling  @xcite we consider groups of users and content .",
    "we assume that individuals within each group have sufficiently similar behavior that their differences do not affect the main questions of interest . in the case of digg",
    ", one such question is the number of votes a story receives over time . in our approach ,",
    "we focus on how a single story accumulates votes , based on the combination of how easily users can find the story and how interesting it is to different groups of users .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we start with a simple model in which story visibility is determined primarily by its location on the recency and friends lists , and use a single value to describe the story s interestingness to the user community .",
    "we use the `` law of surfing ''  @xcite to relate location of the story to how readily users find it .",
    "this model successfully captured the qualitative behavior of typical stories on digg and how that behavior depended on the number of fans of the story s",
    "submitter  @xcite",
    ".    however , the simple model did not quantitatively account for several behaviors in the new data set .",
    "these included the significant daily variation in activity rates seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.digg time ] and systematic differences in behavior between fans of a story s submitter and other users . in particular , the new data was sufficiently detailed to show users tend to find stories their friends submit as more interesting than stories friends vote on but did not submit .",
    "another issue with the earlier model is a fairly large number of votes on stories far down the recency list .",
    "this is especially relevant for upcoming stories where the large rate of new submissions means a given story remains near the top of the recency list for only a few minutes . to account for such votes ,",
    "the model s estimated `` law of surfing '' parameters indicated users browse an implausibly large number of pages while visiting digg .",
    "these observations motivate the more elaborate model described in this paper .",
    "this model includes systematic differences in interestingness between fans and other users and additional ways digg makes stories visible to users .",
    "[ fig.state diagram ]    [ fig.state diagram story ]      we allow for differences between users by separating them into groups , and assume that visibility of stories and voting behavior of users within each group is statistically the same .",
    "we refine the previous stochastic model of digg  @xcite by not only distinguishing votes from fans and non - fans  @xcite , but also allowing for differences between fans of the _ submitter _ and fans of _ other _ voters who are not also fans of the submitter .",
    "the state diagram fig .",
    "[ fig.state diagram ] shows the resulting user model .",
    "the state submitter s fans includes all users who are fans of the submitter and have not yet seen the story ; the other fans state includes all users who are fans of other voters but not the submitter , who have not yet seen the story ; and the non - fans state includes all users who are neither fans of the submitter nor other voters , and have not yet seen the story . the state no vote includes all users who have seen the story and decided not to vote for it .",
    "with respect to votes on a given story treated in this model , users visit digg according to a poisson process with average rate @xmath2 in terms of digg time .",
    "users transition between states stochastically by browsing digg s web pages and voting for stories .",
    "the submitter provides a story s first vote .",
    "all of her fans start in the submitter s fans state , and all other users start in the non - fans state .",
    "each vote causes non - fan users who are that voter s fans and who have not yet seen the story to transition from the non - fans state to the other fans state .",
    "a user making this transition is not aware of that change until later visiting digg and seeing the story on her friends list .",
    "once a user sees a story , she will vote for it with probability given by how interesting she finds the story .",
    "nominally people become fans of those whose contributions they consider interesting , suggesting fans have a systematically higher interest in stories than non - fans .",
    "our model accounts for this by having the probability a user votes on a story depend on the user s state .",
    "users in each state also have a different probability to see stories , which is determined by the story s _ visibility _ to that category of users .",
    "users vote at most once on a story , and our focus is on the final decision to vote or not after the user sees the story .",
    "the visibility of stories changes as stories age and accrue votes .",
    "[ fig.state diagram story ] shows the state diagram of stories .",
    "a story starts at the top of the upcoming stories recency list",
    ". the location increases with each new submission .",
    "a promoted story starts at the top of the front pages .",
    "the location increases as additional stories are promoted .",
    "these state diagrams lead to a description of the average rates of growth  @xcite for votes from submitter fans , other fans and non - fans of prior voters , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the digg time since the story s submission and @xmath2 is the average rate a user visits digg ( measured as a rate per unit digg time ) . we find only a small correlation between voting activity and the number of fans .",
    "thus we use the average rate users visit digg , rather than having the rate depend on the number of fans a user has .",
    "@xmath5 includes the vote by the story s submitter .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the story s _ visibility _ and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the story s _ interestingness _ to users who are submitter fans , other fans or non - fans of prior voters , respectively .",
    "visibility depends on the story s state ( e.g. , whether it has been promoted ) , as discussed below .",
    "interestingness is the probability a user who sees the story will vote on it .",
    "these voting rates depend on the number of users in each category who have not yet seen the story : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the quantities change as users see and vote on the story , with average rate of change given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 the total number of votes the story has received .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is the probability a user is a fan of the most recent voter , conditioned on that user not having seen the story nor being a fan of any voter prior to the most recent voter . for simplicity",
    ", we treat this probability as a constant over the voters , thus averaging over the variation due to clustering in the social network and the number of fans a user has .",
    "the first term in each of these equations is the rate the users see the story .",
    "the second terms arise from the rate the story becomes visible in the friends interface of users who are not fans of previous voters but are fans of the most recent voter .",
    "initially , the story has one vote ( from the submitter ) and the submitter has @xmath20 fans , so @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of active users at the time the story is submitted . over time",
    ", a story becomes less visible to users as it moves down the upcoming or ( if promoted ) front page recency lists , thereby attracting fewer votes and hence fewer new fans of prior voters .",
    "if the story gathers more votes than other stories , it is moved to the top of the popularity list , so becomes more visible .",
    "[ fig.vote distributions ]    fig .",
    "[ fig.vote distributions ] shows the range of votes the stories receive by 24 hours after promotion .",
    "generally , stories have most votes from non - fans , somewhat fewer from other fans and a relatively small number from submitter s fans . the number of votes from submitter s fans is weakly correlated with the numbers from other fans ( correlation coefficient @xmath27 ) and non - fans ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the numbers from other fans and non - fans are highly correlated ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "a fan easily sees the story via the friends interface , so we take @xmath30 for front page stories .",
    "while the story is upcoming , it appears in the friends interface but users do not necessarily choose to view upcoming stories friends liked .",
    "users can readily make this choice because the friends interface distinguishes upcoming from front page stories .",
    "we characterize the lower visibility of upcoming stories with constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 which are less than 1 .",
    "the corresponding visibility is then @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "users who are not fans of prior voters must find the story on the front or upcoming pages . thus @xmath10 depends on how users navigate through these pages and the story s location at the time the user visits digg .",
    "this navigation is not given by our data .",
    "instead , we use a model of user navigation through a series of web pages that has users estimating the value of continuing at the site , and leaving when that value becomes negative  @xcite .",
    "this `` law of surfing '' leads to an inverse gaussian distribution of the number of pages @xmath35 a user visits before leaving the web site , @xmath36 with mean @xmath37 and variance @xmath38 .",
    "we use this distribution for user navigation on digg  @xcite .",
    "the visibility of a story on the @xmath39 front or upcoming page is the fraction of users who visit _ at least _",
    "@xmath35 pages , i.e. , the upper cumulative distribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq.stopping distribution ] ) . for @xmath40 ,",
    "this fraction is @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the complementary error function , and @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the visibility of stories decreases in two distinct ways when a new story arrives .",
    "first , a story moves down the list on its current page .",
    "second , a story at the @xmath47 position moves to the top of the next page . for simplicity , we model these processes as decreasing visibility in the same way through @xmath35 taking on fractional values within a page , e.g.",
    ", @xmath48 denotes the position of a story half way down the list on the first page .",
    "digg presents several lists of stories .",
    "we focus on two lists as the major determinants of visibility for front page stories : reverse chronological order ( `` recency '' ) and most popular in the past 24 hours ( `` popularity '' ) .",
    "users can also find stories via other means .",
    "for instance , digg includes other lists showing recent and popular stories in specific topics ( e.g. , sports or business ) and popularity over longer time periods , e.g. , the previous week .",
    "stories on digg may also be linked to from external web sites ( e.g. , the submitter s blog ) .    for front page votes ,",
    "the recency and popularity lists provide the bulk of non - fan votes while the stories are close to the top of at least one of these lists , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.front page vote locations ] .",
    "the rank on the recency list is the number of stories promoted more recently than that story and the rank on the popularity list is the number of stories , promoted within the 24 hours prior to the vote , with more votes . since a page shows 15 stories , the location in terms of number of pages , as shown in the figure , is @xmath49 the rank , starting from page 1 .",
    "some votes occur while stories are far down both the recency and popularity lists , so the user likely finds the story by another method .    ) , ranging between 0 and 1 as indicated on the legend .",
    ", width=384 ]    [ fig.front page vote locations ]    from these observations , we account for three ways users who are not connected to prior voters find a story : via the recency list , via the popularity list or via one of the other methods described above .",
    "we combine visibility from these three methods assuming independent choices by users , giving the probability to see the story as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the locations of the story on the recency and popularity lists , respectively , and @xmath53 is the probability to find the story by another method .",
    "although the positions of the stories on these lists depend on the specific stories submitted or promoted shortly after the story , these locations are approximately determined by the time @xmath7 and number of votes @xmath54 the story has , as described below . for visibility by other methods",
    ", we simply take @xmath53 to be a constant , independent of story properties such as time since submission or number of votes .",
    "that is , we do not explicitly model factors affecting the visibility of stories by other methods , as the recency and popularity lists account for the bulk of the non - fan votes determined by our parameter estimates discussed below .",
    "the location of a story on the recency and popularity lists could be additional state variables , which change as new stories are added and gain votes . instead of modeling this in detail , we approximate these locations using the close relation between location and time ( for recency ) or votes ( for popularity ) .

    "thus the page number of a story on either the upcoming or front page recency list is  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the time the story is promoted to the front page and the slopes are given in table  [ table.parameters ] .",

    "the distribution of votes among stories in a 24 hour period is similar from day to day .",
    "thus a story s position on the popularity list , determined by the location of its number of votes in this distribution , is approximately a function of its number of votes alone , with only minor variation depending on the time ( i.e. , the set of other stories from the past 24 hours ) .",
    "thus we model the position as depending only on the number of votes the story has at the time , i.e. , consider @xmath52 as a function of the number of votes the story has .",
    "this gives a simple , approximate relation between the actual location and number of votes  ignoring the minor variations due to the specific stories promoted at different times .",

    "[ fig.popularity location ] shows the relation between popularity rank and number of votes for a sample of front page votes within 24-hours of story promotion . to identify a suitable functional approximation for this relation",
    ", we note that a story typically accumulates votes at a rate proportional to how interesting it is to the user population .",
    "as seen in prior analysis of votes in 2006 on digg  @xcite , we expect the interestingness to be lognormally distributed .",
    "thus if we observe a sample of votes on stories over the same time interval for each story , the distribution of votes , and hence location on the popularity list , would follow a lognormal distribution . however , the popularity list includes stories of various times up to 24 hours since submission or promotion .",
    "thus some stories of high interest will have few votes because they were just recently submitted or promoted , and conversely some stories with only moderate interestingness will have relatively many votes because they have been available for votes for nearly 24 hours .",
    "the combination of lognormal distribution of rates for accumulating votes and this variation in the observation times modifies the tails of the lognormal to be power - law , i.e. , a double - pareto lognormal distribution  @xcite .",
    "such a distribution fits the observed positions on the front page popularity list , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig.popularity location ] .",
    "the fit for the rank ( i.e. , number of stories above the given one in the popularity list , so the story promoted in the past 24 hours with the most votes has rank 0 ) is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the average number of stories promoted in 24 hours and @xmath59 is the cumulative distribution of a double - pareto lognormal distribution , i.e. , fraction of cases with fewer than @xmath54 votes .",

    "this fit captures the power - law tail relating stories near the top of the popularity list with the number of votes the story has .",
    "these are the cases for which the popularity list contributes significantly to the overall visibility of a story .",

    "the popularity rank for upcoming stories submitted in the past 24 hours is more complicated than for the front pages due to the promotion .",
    "stories with many votes are more likely to be promoted , and hence removed from the popularity list for upcoming stories .",
    "this removal alters the upper tail of the distribution and hence the numbers of votes for stories appearing near the top of the popularity list .",
    "moreover , out of the @xmath66 stories submitted each day , our data includes only the @xmath67 stories per day eventually promoted",
    ". however , popularity significantly contributes to visibility only for stories near the top of the popularity list .",
    "thus for our model , it is sufficient to determine the relation between votes and rank for upcoming stories with relatively many votes .",
    "such stories are likely to be promoted eventually and hence included in our sample . instead of a power - law tail ,",
    "our data on the eventually promoted stories is better fit by an exponential for the upcoming stories with relatively many votes , and hence near the top of the popularity list : @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "this fit based on the stories eventually promoted substantially underestimates the rank .",
    "nevertheless , the estimated rank for such stories is still sufficiently large that the law of surfing parameters we estimate indicate users do not find such stories via the popularity list .",

    "this estimation involves comparing the observed votes to the voting rate from the model .",
    "as described above , the model uses rate equations to determine the average behavior of the number of votes .",

    "estimating @xmath54 involves maximizing this expression , giving @xmath78 .",
    "thus the maximum - likelihood estimate of the rate for a constant poisson process is the average rate of the observed events .    in our case ,",
    "the voting rate changes with time , requiring a generalization of this estimation . specifically consider a poisson process with nonnegative rate @xmath79 which depends on one or more parameters to be estimated .",
    "thus in a small time interval @xmath80 , the probability for a vote is @xmath81 , and this is independent of votes in other time intervals , by the definition of a poisson process .",
    "suppose we observe @xmath75 votes at times @xmath82 during an observation time interval @xmath83 .",
    "considering small time intervals @xmath84 around each observation , the probability of this observation is @xmath85 the probability for no vote in the interval @xmath86 is @xmath87 thus the log - likelihood for the observed sequence of votes is @xmath88 the maximum - likelihood estimation for parameters determining the rate @xmath79 is a trade - off between these two terms : minimizing @xmath79 over the range @xmath83 to increase the first term while maximizing the values @xmath89 at the times of the observed votes .",
    "if @xmath79 is constant , this likelihood expression simplifies to @xmath90 with maximum at @xmath91 as discussed above for the constant poisson process .",

    "@xcite found that social links between like - minded people , rather than causal influence , explained much of information diffusion observed on a network .",

    "highlighting friends contributions is a common feature of social media sites , including digg . to evaluate the effects of this behavior , we explicitly distinguish votes from submitter s fans , other fans and non - fans in our model , while separating the effects of differences in visibility and interestingness among these groups of users .",

    "our model adjusts for the higher visibility of stories to fans , thereby identifying that increased attention from fans is not just due to the increased visibility .",

    ". this could be particularly important for users with relatively infrequent votes , where variations due to how visible a story is could significantly affect the similarity of the vote pattern with that of other users .    for more precise estimates , the web site could track the fraction of users seeing the story that vote for it , thereby directly estimating interestingness and accounting for the large variability in number of fans among the voters , in contrast to our model which used an average value .",
    "exploiting such details of user behavior becomes more important as the complexity of the web site interface increases , offering many ways for users to locate content . recording which method leads each user to find the story can aid in identifying any systematic differences in interests among those users .",
    "we find a wide range of interestingness ratios between fans and non - fans .",
    "this explains prior observations of the effect of relatively high votes from fans on indicating popularity to the general user population , and also suggests stories that are of niche interest to the fans rather than the general user population .",
    "our assumption that fans of prior voters easily see the story is reasonable for users with relatively few friends , so only a few stories will appear in their friends interface . for users with many friends , visibility of a story would decrease when many newer stories appear on the friends interface .",
    "this possibility could be included in the model using the `` law of surfing '' for the stories appearing in each users friends interface .    for prediction",
    ", we find the largest errors with votes from other fans .",
    "this likely arises from the relatively small number of such votes , especially while the story is upcoming . in that case , the large variation in number of fans per user can have a dramatic effect not accounted for in the model .",
    "this suggests the main source of the prediction error arises from the long - tail distribution of fans per user , which the model treats as a single average value based on the parameter @xmath157 .",
    "we could test this possibility by collecting additional data on the actual fans of each voter , thereby using the observed value of @xmath71 at the time of prediction when estimating @xmath140-values . in cases where @xmath71 is particularly large ,",
    "e.g. , due to an early vote by a user with many fans , this will result in a smaller estimated value for @xmath12 and hence smaller predicted number of other fan votes .",
    "models can suggest improved designs for user - contributory web sites .",
    "our results suggest it may be useful to keep popular stories visible longer for users who return to digg less often  giving them more chance to see the popular stories before they lose visibility .",
    "this would be a fine - tuned version of `` popular stories '' pages , adjusted for each user s activity rate .",
    "that is , instead of showing stories in order of recency only , selectively move less popular stories down the page ( once there are enough votes to determine popularity ) , thereby leaving the more popular ones nearer the top of the list for users who come back to digg less often .",
    "we examined behavior over a relatively short time ( e.g. , up to a day after promotion ) . over longer times",
    ", additional factors could become significant , particularly a decrease in the interestingness as news stories submitted to digg become `` old news ''  @xcite .",
    "modeling visibility depends on how the web site user interface exposes content .",
    "this highlights a challenge for modeling social media : continual changes to the user interface can alter how visibility changes for newly submitted content .",
    "thus accurate models require not only data on user behavior but also sufficient details of the user interface at the time of the data to determine the relation between visibility and properties of the content .",
    "the lognormal distribution of interestingness seen here and in other web sites  @xcite is useful as a prior distribution for estimating interestingness from early behavior on web sites",
    ". the use of such priors will be more important as models make finer distinctions among groups of users , e.g. , distinguishing those who find the content in different ways as provided by more complex interfaces .",
    "in such cases , many groups will not be represented among the early reaction to new content and use of priors will be especially helpful .",
    "user - contributory web sites typically allow users to designate others whose contributions they find interesting , and the sites highlight the activity of linked users .",
