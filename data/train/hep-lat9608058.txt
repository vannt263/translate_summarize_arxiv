    "quarkonia serve as good testing ground for qcd and for theoretical approaches to qcd , including the lattice , due to their rich spectroscopy and decay phenomenology .",
    "furthermore , heavy - heavy and heavy - light systems , are playing a crucial role in probing the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "hence , it is very important that we have reliable well tested methods for simulating heavy quarks .",
    "both four component and two component nonrelativistic ( nrqcd ) fermions are being used to simulate heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "most of the theory has been reviewed in previous lattice meetings .",
    "only a few comments on recent developments in the four component approach will be made here .",
    "the first formulation of four component heavy quarks on the lattice was developed by the fermilab group @xcite .",
    "to date this approach has been implemented at relatively low order . at this level one",
    "works with the same set of parameters as in the clover action for light quark simulations , namely the wilson hopping parameter @xmath1 and the clover coefficient @xmath2 . for",
    "heavy quarks , truncation to these two parameters , does not allow the coefficient of the @xmath3 term in a low momentum dispersion expansion , @xmath4 to come out correctly .",
    "what implications this has for @xmath5 versus @xmath6 of composite particles , is discussed by andreas kronfeld in a poster session at this conference @xcite . for hadrons containing heavy quarks , it is @xmath6 that should be identified with the physical mass . in order to minimize uncertainties associated with @xmath6 and in fixing @xmath1 it is important that the @xmath3 contribution in the action be improved .",
    "problems with @xmath7 in heavy - heavy and heavy - light hadrons using a straight tadpole improved clover action , were pointed out a year ago at melbourne by sara collins and john sloan @xcite .",
    "other four component approaches to heavy quarks have now appeared .",
    "alford - klassen - lepage have a d234(2/3 ) action that goes beyond clover and removes @xmath8 errors at tree level . working with anisotropic lattices , they find good relativistic dispersion relation and spectroscopy results even for heavy quarks around charm @xcite .",
    "the mit - bu group has implemented a `` perfect action '' for fermions truncated to couplings within a hypercube and also find encouraging results for charm @xcite .    due to time constraints , for the rest of the talk i will concentrate on quarkonium physics results rather than formalism and refer the reader to parallel and poster sessions for more theory .",
    "the first test of any lattice method for heavy fermions , is to see how well the observed quarkonium spectrum can be reproduced .",
    "figures 1 & 2 summarize upsilon spectroscopy results by several groups using both quenched ( @xmath9 ) and dynamical ( @xmath10 ) configurations .",

    "1 suggests good agreement between simulations and experiment .",
    "a closer look reveals , for instance , that for the nrqcd data neither the 1p nor the 2s state lies on the experimental line .",
    "this is particularly noticeable for the @xmath13 results and is a reflection of a quenching effect that leads to different quantities giving different @xmath12 s for the wrong number of dynamical flavors if these quantities are governed by different characteristic energy scales .",

    "they are significantly affected by quenching and have a strong dependence on @xmath125 .",
    "tadpole improvement of the action , to remove lattice artifacts , was found to be crucial for achieving agreement with experiment .    in fig .",
    "5 we show charmonium hyperfine splittings in the quenched approximation versus @xmath52 . there are three data points from fermilab using heavy clover at @xmath126=5.7 , 5.9 and 6.1@xcite .",
    "the nrqcd point comes from simulations at @xmath127@xcite .",
    "then there are three coarse lattice results using d234(3/2)@xcite on an anisotropic lattice plus data from howard trottier@xcite , who applied nrqcd on @xmath8 improved glue .",
    "the `` @xmath128 '' s differ from the `` + '' s , in that the former have @xmath52 errors removed from the @xmath129 and @xmath130 fields ( this is an @xmath52 improvement of the nrqcd action that goes beyond tree - level , and appears to be noticeable for @xmath131 ) .",
    "it should be noted that current nrqcd simulations have errors of order @xmath132 for @xmath133 and of order @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "very preliminary estimates of some of the @xmath136 corrections in charmonium indicated the hyperfine splitting could come down significantly . hence , even though the current nrqcd number at @xmath137 is closest to experiment , the true quenched result could be much lower , e.g. at about the @xmath138 level seen by the fermilab group .",
    "it is important that all the spin dependent @xmath139 corrections be included in a future nrqcd simulation .",
    "quarkonia provide many opportunities for lattice gauge theory .",
    "there is a rich phenomenology of spectroscopy , decays and yet to be discovered states .",
    "s - p and 1s-2s splittings provide well controlled scale determinations that lead to accurate determinations of @xmath0 .",
    "spin splittings still pose challenges , but we should be up to them .",
    "quarkonia serve as good testing ground for new actions .",
    "studies of quarkonia create invaluable experience for going onto heavy - light systems .",
    "+ i thank all the people who sent results contained in this review and my colleagues in the nrqcd and heavy - light collaborations for their support and for useful conversations .",
