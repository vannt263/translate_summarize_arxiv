    "observations of most of the globular clusters ( gcs ) located in the galactic bulge region are severely affected by the effects of reddening , both absolute and differential , and by high densities of field stars @xcite .",
    "this highly complicates the analysis and interpretation of their color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , and the accuracy of the physical parameters obtained therefrom .",
    "this is especially dramatic in the case of low - surface brightness , inner - galactic gcs , which complicates even their very detection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis of any variable star content , especially rr  lyrae , in the inner galactic gcs is invaluable for better determining their physical parameters .",
    "rr  lyrae are bright radial pulsators , present in considerable numbers in most of the old galactic gcs @xcite .",
    "they have been shown to follow tight period - luminosity relations in the near - infrared wavebands , especially in the @xmath0-band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that can be used as a powerful tool for distance determinations . but a systematic census and measurement of accurate near - infrared light curves of rr  lyrae variables in the inner galactic gcs have been pending until now .",
    "fortunately , the _ vista variables in the va lctea _ ( vvv ) eso public survey provides a headway in improving this situation .",
    "vvv is a multi - epoch , near - infrared survey that covers most of the bulge region of our galaxy , along with a region of the southern disk with high star formation , using eso s 4-m vista telescope in chile @xcite .",
    "numerous inner galactic globular clusters , 2mass - gc02 and terzan  10 among them , fall inside the area covered by the vvv survey .",
    "this allows us to detect the variable stars of these clusters , derive their periods and mean magnitudes , analyze their light curves , determine their variability types , and employ them , especially any discovered fundamental - mode rr  lyrae pulsators , for a more accurate determination of the physical parameters of their host gcs .",
    "a particular characteristic of the galactic gcs is the oosterhoff dichotomy @xcite .",
    "the gcs in the milky way are clumped into two main groups : oosterhoff i contains fundamental - mode rr  lyrae ( rrab ) with shorter periods ( @xmath1  days ) , and oosterhoff ii have rrab s with longer periods ( @xmath2  days ) , leaving an almost empty gap , the so - called oosterhoff gap , at @xmath3  days .",
    "this dichotomy seems not to be present in other nearby extragalactic systems , which tend to be preferentially oosterhoff - intermediate .",
    "the interpretation of the oosterhoff dichotomy in terms of the history of galactic assembly has been extensively debated .",
    "@xcite theorized that the dichotomy is a result of the decoupled age and metallicity distributions of the galactic gc system , in which the most metal - poor gcs are younger than the oldest ",
    "galactic ones and were accreted from satellites .",
    "however , @xcite argued that age determinations from detailed case studies of halo galactic gcs have not provided enough evidence for this scenario . in any case , the oosterhoff dichotomy implies that the oldest components of the milky way can not have formed by pure accretion of the early counterparts of its present - day dwarf galaxy satellites @xcite .",
    "it is important to add that our current sample of galactic gcs with firm knowledge about their oosterhoff properties is still incomplete .",
    "in particular , bulge gcs are largely unexplored in this respect , mostly due to the lack of time series observations . among the few exceptions with known oosterhoff properties , ngc 6441 and ngc 6388",
    "stand out from the oosterhoff types of both galactic and extragalactic gcs , with @xmath4 too long for their metallicities , forming the so - called oosterhoff iii group @xcite .",
    "this property has been attributed to the presence of a helium - enhanced population of stars in these clusters @xcite , causing the rr lyrae stars of this population to have longer periods , although it remains unclear why seemingly all the rr lyrae stars are helium - enhanced in these two clusters . by observing the yet unknown oosterhoff properties of the bulge gcs , we expect to gain new insights into the formation and evolution of these clusters , and of the central components of the milky way itself .    in a series of papers",
    ", we will explore the near - infrared time - domain of the inner galactic gcs in the framework the vvv survey , characterize their variable star content , and derive the gcs physical parameters therefrom .",
    "in the present paper , the first of this series , we have chosen to study two metal - intermediate , low - surface brightness gcs that show some of the highest reddening in the vvv sample of gcs , 2mass - gc02 and terzan  10 .",
    "our observations are part of the vvv survey , that is being conducted since early 2010 with the 4.1 m vista telescope in cerro paranal observatory , in chile .",
    "the vircam camera on the telescope consists of 16 detectors , each of them providing near - infrared images of @xmath5 with a pixel size of @xmath6 .",
    "we used the stacks of 2 slightly dithered ( @xmath7 in each direction ) individual exposures of the vvv fields that contain our target gcs , 2mass - gc02 and terzan  10 .",
    "the main characteristics of these gcs are listed in table  [ tab_gc ] .",
    "since the field provided by the stacked images is sparsely populated , with significant gaps between the chips , a mosaic pattern is needed for a contiguous coverage of every field observed in the vvv @xcite , and every region covered in our study is observed a minimum of 2 times and a maximum of 6 times per epoch .",
    "the individual images were reduced , astrometrized and stacked by the cambridge astronomy survey unit ( casu ) using the vista data flow system ( vdfs ) pipeline @xcite .",
    "although so - called _ tiles _ , i.e. mosaic images with contiguous coverage of the whole detector area at every field , combined from 6 offset stacked images at each epoch , are also provided by casu , we decided to work with the individual stacked images . this way we avoid problems in the photometry extraction related with combining offset images , which have different geometrical distortions for a given sky region producing highly space - varying and difficult - to - model point - spread functions ( psf ) for the detected objects , and problems related with combining different chips , with significant differences in their dynamic range in some cases .",
    "a set of 43 epochs in @xmath8 for 2mass - gc02 and a set of 101 epochs in @xmath8 for terzan  10 were available at the time of our variability study .",
    "we also used the single - epoch @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 images for every cluster to build the cmds and calculate the stellar extinctions , as we show in the following sections .",
    "most epochs in @xmath8 correspond to different nights , and the seeing in most of them was very good , between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a summary of the observations is provided in table  [ tab_obs ] .",
    "psf photometry was carried out on the individual processed stacked images using an updated version of dophot @xcite .",
    "casu also provides catalogs of aperture photometry , and we used them to calibrate our psf photometry into the vista system .",
    "we chose to perform the psf photometry out to a distance of @xmath15 from the cluster center , well beyond both gcs tidal radii ( see table  [ tab_gc ] ) , to also explore a significant region around the gcs , looking for extra - tidal variables and comparing cluster vs. field ratios of variables in the surroundings of the gcs .",
    "certainly this is one of the advantages provided by the big area surveyed by vvv .",
    "photometry for the same object in the different available images was cross - correlated using the stilts package @xcite .",
    "the generated light curves were next analyzed for variability .",
    "we started our variability analysis by performing iterative @xmath16 and @xmath17 threshold rejections in the light curves , in order to omit outliers that could heavily bias our analyses .",
    "then , we performed a first selection of candidate variable stars by taking advantage of the correlated sampling of the time - series , i.e. , multiple ( 26 ) points at each epoch , resulting from the subsequent exposures with slightly offset pointings necessary to get a contiguous coverage of the field , as described in section  [ sec_obs ] .",
    "these batches of successive exposures are always taken within a few minutes of time , which is by orders of magnitude shorter than both the time between two separate batches , and the typical time - scale of stellar variability of our interest .",
    "therefore , the fluxes measured within such a sequence can well be considered to sample the light curve at the same epoch , thus the differential flux within them will be dominated by noise .",
    "likewise , the deviations of the fluxes measured from the average brightness , for instance , will be expected to be well correlated within such batches in case of intrinsically variable stars , and rather uncorrelated otherwise . a well - known descriptive statistic that was specifically designed to measure",
    "this kind of correlations in astronomical time - series with such sampling is the so - called stetson s index @xcite .",
    "we employed the generalized version of this statistic ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "1 ) for pre - selecting a first set of variable star candidates , by requiring the value of the stetson index to be higher than a pre - determined critical threshold .",
    "the latter was set as the value of the index at the @xmath18 significance level corresponding to pure gaussian noise , and was derived from monte carlo simulations for various different numbers of observational epochs .",
    "this procedure resulted in our broad _",
    "first selection _ of candidate variable stars , including @xmath19 light curves in the areas surrounding both clusters .",
    "candidates pre - selected by their stetson index were subjected to frequency analysis .",
    "first , we binned the light curves in order to simplify the assessment of spectral significance , i.e. we computed the weighted averages of the magnitudes in each batch of stacked images , resulting in light curves with one point per epoch .",
    "then we computed both the generalized lomb - scargle periodogram ( * ? ? ? * gls ) and the phase dispersion spectrum ( * ? ? ? * pdm ) of each light curve , and determined the primary frequency components from both methods in the @xmath20\\,{\\rm d}^{-1}$ ] frequency range , using a spectral oversampling factor of 10 .",
    "significance levels of these components were estimated analytically .",
    "we selected the light curves that showed periodic signals detected with better than @xmath18 significance by both methods ( not requiring the frequencies to coincide ) .",
    "we rejected signals with close to integer @xmath21 frequencies in order to exclude false alarms triggered by typical systematics of ground - based observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , we considered light curves showing low - frequency spectral excess with a total amplitude of @xmath22  mag , which could be indicative of periodic signals with periods longer than the time span of our observations , or aperiodic variations such as transients .",
    "our procedure resulted in our narrow _ second selection _ of @xmath23 and @xmath24 variable star candidates in the case of 2mass - gc02 and ter 10 , respectively .    in the next step of our analysis",
    ", we performed a combined visual inspection of both the phase diagrams and the images of each and every object in the _ second selection _ , and rejected those which did not meet some basic phenomenological criteria .",
    "most rejected light curves had obvious signs of temporal saturation and/or blending and showed false signals originating from these effects .",
    "in addition , a large number of sources turned out to be fake variables , with periodic signals emanating from the temporally contaminating flux from the rotating diffraction spikes of nearby saturated stars ( due to the altazimuthal configuration of vista ) . as a result of this procedure , we narrowed down our selection to 102 and 160 variables in the field of 2mass - gc02 and ter  10 , respectively .    as a final step in our time - series analysis , we performed an iterative refinement procedure on the _ unbinned _ light curves .",
    "we performed a non - linear fourier fit using the frequencies from the gls / pdm analyses as initial values , visually optimizing the number of fourier orders for each object . in cases where the frequencies from the two methods had a significant discrepancy",
    ", we adopted the one that produced the smaller @xmath25 .",
    "we then performed a threshold rejection around the fit , and refitted the light curve until the procedure converged in a final solution .",
    "the apparent @xmath8-band equilibrium brightnesses of the stars were estimated by the intensity - averaged magnitudes of the stars , computed from the fourier fits to the light curves .",
    "the total amplitudes of the light curves were computed from the fourier fits .",
    "we tried to assign a variability type to the discovered variables , but this task proved to be non - trivial .",
    "most variable stars are more difficult to be classified in the near - infrared bands , especially in @xmath8 , because their light curves contain less features than in the optical ( e.g. , fundamental - mode rr  lyrae show smaller amplitudes and more sinusoidal light curves in the near - infrared than in the optical ) , and there is a general absence of near - infrared template light curves , compared to the situation in the optical . within the vvv collaboration we are trying to solve this shortcoming with the vvv templates project @xcite , which will eventually lead to automated classification of all vvv light curves @xcite . since we are still developing the algorithms for such an automated classification , for the present study we adopted an",
    " eyeball  classification , providing a type only for those variables that had well - measured light curves and could be securely classified based on their periods and characteristic light curve features .",
    "fundamental - mode rr  lyrae stars , cepheids , eclipsing binaries ( mostly of algol - type ) , and long - period variables ( lpvs ) , are found among the stars that we believe could be reliably classified in this way .",
    "2mass - gc02 is an inner galactic gc , only recently discovered by @xcite serendipitously during a spot check of 2mass images for quality assurance review .",
    "its elevated extinction made it invisible in earlier optical observations .",
    "since its discovery , there have been a few photometric studies trying to determine its physical parameters @xcite , with a range of values proposed for extinction and distances , depending on various metallicity and chemical enrichment scenarios .",
    "@xcite quoted values @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28}=-0.5 $ ] , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath28}=-1.0 $ ] , or @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath28}=-2.0 $ ] , while @xcite found @xmath33 and @xmath34 for a disk - like enrichment scenario , or @xmath35 and @xmath36 for a bulge - like one .    to start our analysis of 2mass - gc02",
    ", we built the cluster cmds for the various available filter combinations from our vvv photometry . in figure",
    "[ fig_cmd2ms02 ] , we show the @xmath8 vs. @xmath37 cmd .",
    "stars inside the half - light radius , plotted with bigger solid squares , allow us to distinguish the red - giant branch ( rgb ) of the cluster , with a clump at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , but do not reach the main - sequence ( ms ) turn - off point .",
    "in addition , 2mass - gc02 is poorly - populated , and it lies in a region of high field stellar densities , so including in the cmd stars located farther away from the cluster center , but still well within its tidal radius   which in other cases , like halo gcs surrounded by fields with small stellar densities , would help to increase the definition of the rgb branch   , here only makes the task of analyzing the cluster cmd more difficult .",
    "the elevated number of bulge field giants present , lying in the same cmd region where the cluster stars are located , adds confusion to the study of 2mass - gc02 .",
    "the presence of significant differential extinction in the field , clearly shown by the broadenings in the rgb and red clump ( rc ) of the bulge stars present , complicates even more the cmd analysis . to complete the description of the observed cmd",
    ", we should mention that a significant number of field , main - sequence disk stars can be observed as a clear branch of stars bluer than @xmath40",
    ". a deeper , more quantitative analysis of the cluster cmd will probably not allow us to extract the physical parameters of the cluster with better accuracy than previous photometric studies down to similar magnitude depths @xcite .",
    "instead , we decided to take advantage of our multi - epoch variability survey and use it to extract these physical parameters from the information provided by the rr  lyrae contained in the cluster .",
    "there are observations in @xmath8 in 43 different epochs for 2mass - gc02 during the period 2010 - 2013 of the vvv survey ( see table  [ tab_obs ] ) , although we only considered 42 in our following analysis since tracking problems during the observations of one set produced very elongated stars that were unusable for our variability study .",
    "we more than triple the number of epochs in the only previous variability study of this cluster , performed by @xcite , with only 13 epochs .",
    "they found 5 rr  lyrae variable candidates , but our improved photometry and temporal coverage shows that none of them is a true variable star away , i.e. , separated by more than 9 pixels in the vvv images , and the reported periods and average magnitudes are quite different . ] .",
    "fortunately , after performing the variability analysis described in section  [ sec_varana ] , we were able to find 32 new variable candidates inside the tidal radius . among them",
    ", we identified 13 rr  lyrae variables , 3 cepheids , 4 eclipsing binaries , and 3 lpvs .",
    "their positions , periods , amplitudes , magnitudes and colors are shown in table  [ tab_var2ms02 ] ( nv1 to nv32 ) , their light curves are plotted in figure  [ fig_lc2ms02 ] , their positions on the sky can be observed in figure  [ fig_chart2ms02 ] , and their positions in the cmd can be observed in the left panel of figure  [ fig_cmd2ms02 ] .",
    "all of the rr  lyrae candidates found ( nv1 to nv10 , nv13 , nv24 and nv26 ) seem to be rrab s according to their periods and light curves . from their position in the cmd and on the sky , it is immediately clear that the rr  lyrae candidates towards the north of the cluster center ( nv4 , nv7 , nv9 and nv13 ) have redder colors , and therefore seem to be more severely affected by extinction , than the rrab candidates in the south ( nv1 , nv2 , nv5 , nv6 , nv8 ) . this feature points towards significant differential extinction across the face of the cluster",
    ". from their position in the different available cmds , all the rrab candidates seem to belong to the cluster except nv26   we will further confirm this point in section  [ sec_dis2ms02 ] .",
    "nv26 is approximately half a magnitude dimmer than the other rrab variables with similar colors , which implies that the increase in magnitude is not due to higher reddening .",
    "this feature , clearly observable in figure  [ fig_ext2ms02 ] , along with being the one farthest away from the cluster center and having a period significantly shorter than most of the other rrab candidates , suggest it is a background field rr  lyrae .",
    "the cepheid candidates nv11 , nv28 , and nv31 show periods between @xmath41 and @xmath42 days , and light curves with a sawtooth shape , characteristic of these stars in @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". unfortunately , none of them seem to have high chances to belong to the cluster . nv11 and nv28 are too dim to be type ii cepheids belonging to 2mass - gc02 . according to the period - luminosity relations by @xcite , their apparent distance moduli are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which differ significantly from those of the rr  lyrae shown in figure  [ fig_ext2ms02 ]   the method to obtain those is explained in section  [ sec_dis2ms02 ] .",
    "their position in the cmd suggest they are background bulge field cepheids .",
    "on the other hand , nv31 has @xmath45 , according to the period - luminosity relations by @xcite for type ii cepheids .",
    "this apparent distance modulus is in the range shown by the rr  lyrae in the gc ( see figure  [ fig_ext2ms02 ] ) , but as shown in the cmd in figure  [ fig_cmd2ms02 ] , its color is too blue for nv31 to belong to the cluster or bulge .",
    "the eclipsing binary candidates nv12 , nv20 , nv22 , and nv32 have light curve characteristics of algol - type binaries ( ea ) .",
    "nv32 is too blue to be a cluster member based on its position in the cmd , but the remaining ea candidates can not be disregarded as cluster members from the cmd examination since they lie in regions where there are cluster stars .    at the present time , there is not much we can say about the 3 lpvs discovered , nv16 , nv19 and nv27 .",
    "their long periods have not allowed us yet to sample their light curves with enough phase coverage for an accurate period determination .",
    "also their red colors seem to be the reason nv16 has been detected only in @xmath8 , nv27 in @xmath12 and @xmath8 , and nv19 in @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "almost all of the remaining 9 unclassified variables seem to be disk field stars based on their position in the cmd . the only one that could be a cluster member is nv29 .",
    "as previously mentioned in section  [ sec_obs ] , we performed a search for variables out to a radius of @xmath15 from the cluster center .",
    "this allowed us to look for variables in the field surrounding the gc , in an area approximately 3 times the size of the cluster .",
    "we found a total of 70 new variable candidates in this surrounding region .",
    "their positions , periods , amplitudes , magnitudes and colors are shown in table  [ tab_var2ms02 ] ( nv33 to nv102 ) , their light curves are plotted in figure  [ fig_lc2ms02 ] , their positions on the sky can be observed in figure  [ fig_chart2ms02 ] , and their positions in the cmd can be observed in the right panel of figure  [ fig_cmd2ms02 ] .",
    "we found 6 extra - tidal rr  lyrae ( nv70 , nv72 , nv76 , nv77 , nv85 , and nv99 ) in the region studied outside the tidal radius . from the shape of their light curve and their periods they are rrab s . from their position in the cmd",
    "all of them are clearly in the background of the gc , except nv85 and nv99  we will further confirm this point in section  [ sec_dis2ms02]. the high angular separations from the center of the cluster ( see table  [ tab_var2ms02 ] ) and the positions in the sky ( see figure  [ fig_chart2ms02 ] ) of nv85 and nv99 suggest that , instead of being variables in a hypothetical gc tidal tail , they have a higher chance of being field stars located at a distance similar to that of the cluster .",
    "most of the found field rr  lyrae being in the background of the cluster , points towards 2mass - gc02 being in front or in the near - side of the galactic bulge .",
    "in addition to these 6 rr  lyrae , we also identified 6 cepheids , 4 eclipsing binaries , and 19 lpv candidates . from a purely statistical point of view , being the surrounding area 3 times bigger than the region inside the tidal radius , we should expect 2 field rr  lyrae , 2 field cepheids , 1 field eclipsing binaries , and 6 field lpv candidates inside the cluster radius .",
    "these numbers of variables are within the range of these objects found in section  [ sec_var2ms02 in ] , given that we are dealing with small number statistics , except for the case of rr  lyrae , where we find many more ( however , it agrees with the number of field rr  lyrae found in section  [ sec_var2ms02 in ] ) .",
    "therefore , this strengthens our assumption that most of the inner rr  lyrae candidates found in section  [ sec_var2ms02 in ] are cluster members , and most , if not all , of the inner cepheids , eclipsing binaries , and lpv candidates are field stars .",
    "the reddening values and distances of every individual rrab star can be accurately calculated using their tight period - luminosity - metallicity relations in the near - infrared @xcite .",
    "following the steps detailed in @xcite , we adapted the @xcite period - luminosity relations to be used with the vircam / vista filter system : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the period of the rrab and @xmath9 its metallicity .",
    "the only spectroscopic determination of the iron content for the stars in 2mass - gc02 we have found in the literature is by @xcite .",
    "they found a value of @xmath28}=-1.08 $ ] , using low - resolution infrared spectroscopy of secondary lines in a set of 12 cluster stars , selected by their photometry and radial velocities}=-1.08 $ ] from high - resolution spectra of a few cluster giants . ] .",
    "although photometric estimations are a little higher , with values between @xmath28}=-0.66 $ ] @xcite to @xmath28}=-0.98 $ ] @xcite , we decided to stick to the spectroscopic value , which is also the one provided by the @xcite catalog ( see table  [ tab_gc ] ) . using a canonical helium fraction @xmath52 , and an alpha - element enhancement @xmath53=0.3 $ ] , common among galactic gcs @xcite",
    ", we translate the iron content @xmath28}=-1.08 $ ] to the metallicity @xmath54 that we will assume for all the rrab stars in the cluster .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the apparent distance modulus of the rrab candidates in @xmath8 ( see figure  [ fig_ext2ms02 ] ) , using the calculated period and average apparent magnitudes in table  [ tab_var2ms02 ] . but",
    "to calculate the absolute distance modulus we need to carry out some further calculations and adopt some further assumptions in order to obtain the extinction first . ideally to calculate the extinction , we should also have the light curve in some other near - infrared filter in addition to @xmath8 , but vvv only provides single - epoch observations in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "what is worse , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnitudes of the rr  lyrae candidates in 2mass - gc02 are in most cases below the detection limit ( see table  [ tab_var2ms02 ] ) . for our analysis ,",
    "we assume that @xmath37 ( or @xmath55 ) at the phase position when the @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) image was taken is equal to the average @xmath37 ( or @xmath55 ) color of the rr  lyrae candidate .",
    "we obtain the @xmath8 value at the desired phase from our fourier fits to the light curves for the rrab candidates ( see section  [ sec_varana ] ) , calculate this way the apparent colors of these rr  lyrae candidates , shown in table  [ tab_var2ms02 ] , and using equations 3 to 5 obtain their color excesses @xmath56 and @xmath57 , shown in figure  [ fig_ext2ms02 ] .",
    "now , in order to obtain the absolute distance modulus to 2mass - gc02 we should transform those color excesses to extinctions using the total - to - selective extinction ratios .",
    "but these ratios have been shown to differ from the values obtained from the standard @xcite extinction law , when observing towards the galactic center and bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , instead of adopting a ratio from the literature , the highly differential reddening inside the cluster s area enables us to simultaneously obtain the absolute distance modulus and the total - to - selective extinction ratio ( and hence the extinction ) by doing a linear fit between the two parameters we already had , the apparent distance modulus @xmath58 and the color excess ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "since there are errors associated with both variables , the fit is performed using the ordinary least square bisector method , which has been proven to outperform other approaches in such cases @xcite .",
    "the fits are shown in figure  [ fig_ext2ms02 ] .",
    "as we can expect , most rr  lyrae outside the tidal radius are obvious outliers in the fit , and can be clearly located in the background of the cluster ( see section  [ sec_var2ms02out ] ) . from the rr  lyrae inside the tidal radius ,",
    "only nv26 has been also considered to be an outlier , due to its considerable residuals , and was discarded from the fitted sample ( see discussion and explanations for these cases in section  [ sec_var2ms02 in ] ) . from the final fit , we obtain the ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 shown in table  [ tab_ext ] .",
    "these ratios are a little lower than those obtained by @xcite , and are certainly smaller than suggested by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the absolute distance modulus , calculated as the average of the zero - points of the fits , is @xmath61 , where the first @xmath62 is obtained from the statistical errors in the fit , and the second one comes from omitting some of the fitted stars , as we explained in the following paragraph .",
    "this value for the absolute distance modulus yields the cluster s distances to the sun and to the galactic center shown in table  [ tab_dis ] , putting the object farther away from us and more than 1 kpc closer to the galactic center than shown in the @xcite catalog . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we chose as a good reference value for the extinction towards 2mass - gc02 @xmath63 , the mean of the cluster rrab candidates , but we would like to remark that extinction towards this cluster is highly variable , with almost 50% changes over small regions , and with significant deviations from the standard extinction law .    the assumption of @xmath64 that we have done by using only one epoch in j and h in order to obtain the colors of the rr  lyrae , does not add significantly to the error budget of the different calculated magnitudes . using the relations from appendix b1.3 in @xcite , we observed that the ratios between the amplitudes of the rr  lyrae in the near - infrared change according to the amplitudes of the rr  lyrae , and for the amplitudes of the detected rr  lyrae ( see table  [ tab_var2ms02 ] ) , the values is obtained by navarrete et al .",
    "( in preparation ) when studying the rr  lyrae light curves in the near - infrared in omegacen . ] should be in the ranges @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and the errors in the rr  lyrae colors due to our assumption could be , at most , of one tenth of a magnitude in @xmath37 , and one hundredth of a magnitude in @xmath55 .",
    "note however that these would be the extreme cases when the measurements were taken at a phase corresponding to a maximum or a minimum ; generally the error should be smaller , and their effect on the elevated color excesses that we obtained ( see figure  [ fig_ext2ms02 ] ) almost negligible .",
    "what is more , any effects from our assumption of @xmath64 would cancel out to some extent in the fit we have done to obtain the absolute distance modulus and the reddening law , since the measurements of @xmath11 and @xmath12 were done at random phase times , which means that errors in color excesses should have similar chances of being positive and negative , and the only observable effect would be a small increase in the dispersion of the points around the fit . more important for the error budget of the extinction ratios @xmath67 and the absolute distance modulus @xmath68 would be if one of the fitted rr  lyrae with a higher extinction ( nv4 or nv7 ) resulted not to be a member of the cluster .",
    "since they present the highest deviations from the fit , and they are also important to extend the extinction baseline , we decided to show the effects of omitting one of them as the variations shown by the second term in the error of the extinction ratios @xmath67 and the absolute distance modulus @xmath68 .",
    "the average period of the cluster rrab candidates used in the fit ( nv1-nv10 , nv13 and nv24 ) is @xmath69 days , which puts 2mass - gc02 in the oosterhoff gap , as we can see in figure  [ fig_oos ] .",
    "based on the absence of galactic gcs in this gap , and their high incidence in nearby extragalactic systems ( see figure  [ fig_oos ] ) , this feature could suggest an extragalactic origin for 2mass - gc02 .",
    "however , we should note that we are dealing with small number statistics here , since only 12 rrab s are considered .",
    "since its discovery by @xcite , there have been only a few photometric studies published on terzan  10  ",
    "e.g. , @xcite in the near - infrared , @xcite in the optical ; and no spectroscopic studies of its individual stars , although @xcite studied the integrated spectra of this gc .",
    "estimations of the reddening range from @xmath70 @xcite or @xmath71 @xcite to @xmath72 @xcite or @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "its distance modulus estimations also show a significant range , varying from @xmath74 @xcite to @xmath75 @xcite .    in figure  [ fig_cmdt10 ]",
    ", we show the @xmath8 vs. @xmath37 cmd of the cluster that we built with our vvv psf photometry .",
    "it is immediately clear that , although extinction is lower than for 2mass - gc02 ( see figure  [ fig_cmd2ms02 ] ) , it is difficult to disentangle cluster stars from their field counterparts . even at distances smaller than the half - light radius , plotted with bigger solid squares in the left panel of figure  [ fig_cmdt10 ] , there is a significant presence of disk and bulge field populations in addition to the gc .",
    "the rgb of the cluster , with a clump at @xmath76 and @xmath77 , is mixed with bulge field giants .",
    "the brightest disk field stars are bluer than the upper rgb stars ( @xmath78 ) and can be easily separated from them , but the dimmest disk field stars contribute to the confusion caused by the bulge field stars , since both are located in the same region as the subgiant branch ( sgb ) and upper ms of the cluster . therefore , even though our photometry reaches the turn - off point of the ms , we can not properly define it due to the contamination by the field populations .",
    "again , instead of trying to perform a deeper cmd analysis and statistical field star decontamination , we decided to take advantage of our variability survey and use it to extract terzan  10 physical parameters from the information provided by the rr  lyrae variables we identified in the cluster .",
    "observations in @xmath8 were taken in 101 different epochs for terzan  10 during the period 2010 - 2013 of the vvv survey ( see table  [ tab_obs ] ) , making this region one of the most sampled in the vvv so far .",
    "no previous search for variable stars in this cluster has been ever done , close to the magnitude limit where the completeness of the ogle detection is small .",
    "we should also note that we are not able to recover any of the 7 rrc candidates that @xcite find in terzan  10 and its surroundings , due to the smaller amplitudes of these variable stars in the near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "] , so this high amount of available epochs puts us in a superb position to find for the first time highly significant variable candidates in this gc .",
    "our analysis resulted in 48 variable candidates inside @xmath79 , the tidal radius extracted from the @xcite catalog . among the 48 candidates",
    ", we identified 8 rr  lyrae variables , 8 cepheids , 7 eclipsing binaries , and 1 lpv .",
    "their positions , periods , amplitudes , magnitudes and colors are shown in table  [ tab_vart10 ] ( nv1 to nv48 ) , their light curves are plotted in figure  [ fig_lct10 ] , their positions in the sky can be observed in figure  [ fig_chartt10 ] , and their positions in the cmd can be observed in the left panel of figure  [ fig_cmdt10 ] .",
    "all of the rr  lyrae candidates found ( nv2 , nv3 , nv5 , nv6 , nv7 , nv12 , nv22 and nv24 ) seem to be rrab s , according to their periods and light curves . from their position in the cmd and in the sky ,",
    "the rr  lyrae are located along the reddening vector , suggesting the presence of differential extinction in this gc , with the candidates towards the north of the cluster center ( nv3 and nv5 ) with redder colors , and therefore more heavily affected by extinction , than the rrab candidates in the south ( nv2 , nv6 , nv7 and nv12 ) . on the cmd",
    ", we can observe that all rr  lyrae show a behavior consistent with their belonging to the cluster and following the same , but again non - standard , reddening law , except nv12   we will further confirm this point in section  [ sec_dist10 ] .",
    "nv12 is a little brighter than the other rr  lyrae with similar colors , which suggests that it is a foreground rr  lyrae star .    none of the cepheid candidates found ( nv14 , nv16 , nv17 , nv18 , nv19 , nv31 , nv39 and nv47 ) could be a cepheid that belongs to the cluster according to the @xcite period - luminosity relations . while most of them are too dim to even belong to the galactic bulge , nv16 and nv17 have apparent distance moduli consistent with being bulge type ii cepheids ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , along with positions in the cmd accordant with it .",
    "but they do not seem to belong to terzan  10 either .",
    "a quick visual comparison with the rr  lyrae apparent distance moduli and extinctions shown in figure  [ fig_extt10 ]   the method to obtain them is explained in section  [ sec_dist10 ]   strongly points towards nv16 being a type ii cepheid in the background of the cluster , and nv17 being in its foreground .",
    "all the eclipsing binary candidates ( nv1 , nv4 , nv20 , nv23 , nv32 , nv41 , and nv45 ) lie in a region of the cmd compatible with being cluster members , except nv4 and nv23 , which are located among the disk field stars . based on their light curves",
    "most of them appear to be ea stars .",
    "only 1 lpv was found inside the tidal radius of the cluster , nv48 .",
    "its long period precludes us from having a well - sampled light curve .",
    "the vast majority of the remaining 23 unclassified variables , seems to be comprised of disk field variables , based on their positions in the cmd ( see figure  [ fig_cmdt10 ] ) .      for terzan  10",
    ", we also performed a search for variables in the immediate surrounding of the cluster , out to a radius of @xmath15 from its center .",
    "this encircles an area approximately 3 times the size of the cluster out to its tidal radius . in this region",
    "we found 112 more variable candidates .",
    "their positions , periods , amplitudes , magnitudes and colors are shown in table  [ tab_vart10 ] ( nv49 to nv160 ) , their light curves are plotted in figure  [ fig_lct10 ] , and their positions in the cmd can be observed in the right panel of figure  [ fig_cmdt10 ] .",
    "we found 12 rr  lyrae candidates in the surveyed region , significantly more than the rr  lyrae found in the surrounding of 2mass - gc02 . but extinction in that region was higher , as we can guess just by looking at the redder colors of the stars there , and the angular separation from the galactic center was also higher , meaning that less of the projected bulge was sampled . in general , rr  lyrae found in the surroundings of terzan  10 are a little brighter than the ones found inside its tidal radius , and their colors are similar , which suggests similar reddenings .",
    "these two facts imply that they are field rr  lyrae in the foreground of the cluster , suggesting that the cluster is on the far side of the bulge , farther away than the galactic center .",
    "we will confirm this result and further discuss it in section  [ sec_dist10 ] . from the cmd and from the further analysis in section  [ sec_dist10 ] ,",
    "only one of the rr  lyrae , nv140 , is behind the cluster , and other two , nv105 and nv136 , lie at a distance consistent with being cluster members , although their high angular distances from the cluster center make more probable that they are field stars at the cluster s distance . from a statistical point of view , the expected number of field rr  lyrae inside the cluster radius should be @xmath82 , since the surrounding region is 3 times the area occupied by the cluster .",
    "although we only found 1 ( see section  [ sec_vart10 in ] ) , we should note that we are dealing with small number statistics here .",
    "we also identified 15 cepheids , 27 eclipsing binaries , and 2 lpvs .",
    "therefore , we should expect in the area inside the cluster tidal radius close to 5 field cepheids , 9 field eclipsing binaries and 1 field lpv , given the bigger size of the surrounding region ( 3:1 ) .",
    "the amounts of these kinds of variables found in section  [ sec_vart10 in ] ( 8 cepheids , 7 eclipsing binaries and 1 lpv ) are of the same order , suggesting that most , if not all , of the variables of these types found in section  [ sec_vart10 in ] belong to the field population , and not to the cluster .",
    "the number of lpvs seems odd when compared with 2mass - gc02 .",
    "there we found 19 lpvs , while in the surrounding of terzan  10 we found only 2 .      to calculate the distance and the extinction to terzan  10 we follow the same steps as in section  [ sec_dis2ms02 ] .",
    "we use equations 1 to 5 to obtain the absolute magnitudes of our rr  lyrae candidates in the different available filters .",
    "unfortunately , we found no spectroscopic metallicity measurements of individual stars in terzan  10 , and we have to rely on only photometric and integrated spectroscopic values .",
    "metallicity estimations vary between @xmath28}=-0.7 $ ] in the photometric studies by @xcite to @xmath28}=-1.2 $ ] ( @xmath83=-1.35 $ ] ) in the integrated spectroscopic studied by @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath28}=-1.00 $ ] , from the @xcite catalog , and assuming the same @xmath10 and @xmath84-enhancement as in section  [ sec_dis2ms02 ] , we obtain a value of @xmath85 for the cluster s metallicity , that we used as input for equations 1 to 5 , along with our measured periods . the mean rr  lyrae apparent @xmath8 magnitude is obtained as mentioned in section  [ sec_varana ] , and the apparent colors from the @xmath8 measurements obtained by interpolating in our fourier fit to the @xmath8 light curve at the same phase as the single - epoch images in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 were taken .    as in section  [ sec_dis2ms02 ] , we did not assume an a priori extinction law to relate color excess with apparent distance modulus of the rrab candidates . instead , using the ordinary least square bisector method , we got a linear fit between both parameters , which provide us with values for the extinction ratios @xmath86 , as the slope of the fit , and an absolute distance modulus , as the zero - point of the fit ( see figure  [ fig_extt10 ] ) . in our analysis , the only clear outlier among the rr  lyrae inside the tidal radii , and therefore excluded from the fit , was nv12 ( see discussion in section  [ sec_vart10 in ] ) .",
    "some of the rr  lyrae in the surrounding field outside the tidal radius could belong to the cluster according to their distances , although this is not very plausible ( see discussion in section  [ sec_vart10out ] ) .",
    "again , the ratios @xmath86 derived from the fit differ from those of the standard @xcite law , and agree better with those derived by @xcite , as we can see in table  [ tab_ext ] .",
    "the fact that the zero - point of the fits , i.e. , the absolute distance modulus , show a much smaller spread among the values derived from using the different filter - combinations , than if we just use the @xcite law ( see figure  [ fig_extt10 ] ) , reinforces our confidence in the fitted values .",
    "we adopt the weighted average of the zero - points from the different color - excess fits , as the absolute distance modulus of terzan  10 .",
    "we obtain a value @xmath87 , where again the first @xmath62 is obtained from the statistical errors in the fit , while the second one comes from omitting two of the fitted stars , nv22 and nv5 , which have the smallest and biggest extintion values .",
    "this value of @xmath68 implies the cluster is much farther away from us than previously thought , almost by a factor of 2 ( see table  [ tab_dis ] ) .",
    "this also implies that terzan  10 is beyond the galactic center , in the far side of the galactic bulge .",
    "until now it was believed that all the inner galactic gcs found so far were located in the near side of the bulge @xcite . for the sake of comparison , a good reference value for the extinction towards terzan  10 is @xmath88 , the mean of the cluster rrab candidates that made our fit , but we emphasize that extinction towards this cluster is also highly variable , with almost 50% changes over small regions , and with significant deviations from the standard extinction law .    the average period of terzan  10 rrab variable candidates used in the fit ( nv2 , nv3 , nv5 , nv6 , nv7 , nv22 and nv24 ) is @xmath89 days , which makes terzan  10 an oosterhoff ii cluster . however , its iron - content is significantly higher than the ones of the other galactic ( and even extragalactic ) oosterhoff ii gcs ( see figure  [ fig_oos ] ) .",
    "but we should remember here that the metallicity value adopted in this work is the average of two previous works ( @xmath28}=-0.7 $ ] by @xcite , and @xmath28}=-1.2 $ ] by @xcite ) , as we mentioned in the beginning of this section .",
    "if @xmath28}=-0.7 $ ] is closer to the true value , this will put terzan  10 closer to ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , in the scarcely populated oosterhoff iii group of metal - rich clusters with rr  lyrae .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath28}=-1.2 $ ] is closer to reality , terzan  10 would still be the most metal - rich cluster in the oosterhoff ii group , and would still stand out significantly from the locus of galactic gcs .",
    "this uncertainty makes a strong case to obtain spectroscopic metallicity measurements from individual stars in this gc .",
    "we have shown the potential of the vvv survey for studying the variable stars of the inner galactic gcs , by analyzing two highly - reddened gcs of this sample , 2mass - gc02 and terzan  10 .",
    "we have discovered 32 new variables inside the tidal radius of 2mass - gc02 and 70 in a close surrounding region , while for terzan  10 we have found 48 new variables inside its tidal radius , and 112 in its immediate surroundings . in both gcs , we have found a significant number of fundamental - mode rr  lyrae ( 12 in 2mass - gc02 , 7 in terzan  10 ) that we have used to accurately measure the extinctions and distances of these gcs , and to explore the non - standard extinction law in their directions .",
    "both clusters are closer to the galactic center than previously thought ( @xmath90 kpc for 2mass - gc02 ; @xmath91 kpc for terzan  10 ) .",
    "we have also found terzan  10 to be beyond the galactic center , making it the only currently known gc to be on the far side of the galactic bulge .",
    "extinction towards both clusters is elevated ( especially towards 2mass - gc02 ) and highly differential , and it follows a non - standard law , with values for the selective - to - total extinction ratios similar to those quoted by @xcite .",
    "we have also found both clusters to have quite uncommon oosterhoff properties .",
    "terzan  10 can be one of the most metal - rich oosterhoff ii gcs found in the galaxy , or belong to the scarcely - populated metal - rich oosterhoff iii group , depending on the true metallicity of this cluster .",
    "the latter case would imply a possible he self - enrichment scenario , in analogy to the other two oosterhoff iii gcs ( see @xcite , for a review and extensive references ) .",
    "2mass - gc02 , on the other hand , is located in the oosterhoff gap where very few of the galactic globular clusters lie , which may suggest an extragalactic origin for this gc .",
    "there are 34 more known inner galactic gcs covered by the vvv survey , and the study of their variable stars , which we plan to present in future papers in this series , will greatly contribute to better establish their physical parameters , and to understand the origin of the oosterhoff dichotomy in our galaxy .",
    "we thank andrzej udalski for his help comparing some of our detected variables with unpublished ogle data to better determine their variability type .",
