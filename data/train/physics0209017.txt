    "understanding chemical reactions that take place on catalytic surfaces is of vital importance to the chemical industry .",
    "the knowledge can be used to improve catalysts thus yielding better reactors .",
    "in addition , improving the catalytic process in engines can lead to improvement of environmental conditions .",
    "dynamic monte carlo simulations have turned out to be a powerful tool to model and analyse surface reactions  @xcite .",
    "in such a dmc model , the surface is described as a two - dimensional lattice of sites that can be occupied by particles .",
    "the simulation consist of changing the surface over time by execution of reactions , which are merely modifcations of small neighborhoods .",
    "simple models can be simulated easily ; however , for more complicated models and for larger systems computation time and memory use become very large .",
    "one way of dealing with this is to use parallelism .",
    "there are roughly three ways to introduce parallelism in simulations .",
    "first one may choose an existing simulation algorithm and exploit inherent concurrency .",
    "this boils down to a parallelization effort which is by no means straightforward but limited by the properties of the algorithm one starts with .",
    "general parallel methods such as the optimistic method time warp or the pessimistic methods suggested by misra and chandy can be used  @xcite .",
    "if the model ( and , hence , the algorithm ) does not admit much concurrency one may try to change the model .",
    "the penalty in many cases will be that such a model is less accurate but this may be acceptable .",
    "third , the necessary statistics may be obtained from the averaging of a large number of small , independent simulations ( this is , in fact , an instance of the second approach ) .",
    "the mathematical model for dmc simulations of surface reactions is the master equation (  @xcite , see also section 2 ) .",
    "the algorithms based on it are rather sequential in nature and do not admit an optimistic parallel simulation method like time warp .",
    "this is because each reaction disables many others and , hence , an optimistic method would result in frequent roll - back .",
    "successful parallel methods therefore change the model .",
    "the most frequently used alternative model is that of a cellular automaton ( ca ) model .",
    "the ca model  @xcite is inherently parallel : all sites of the lattice are updated simultaneously according to the state of the neighboring sites .",
    "the time is incremented after updating synchronously all the sites of the lattice , such that the state of a cell at time @xmath0 depends on the state of the neighboring sites at time @xmath1 .",
    "each site is updated according to a transition rule dependent on the state of the neighboring sites .",
    "there are two problems with the ca .",
    "first , all patterns ( i.e. , neighborhood occupations ) are treated on the same footing . in practice , however , these patterns represent different reactions that proceed with a different speed .",
    "the solution is to use a so - called non - deterministic ca ( ndca ) in which execution of reaction is performed with a probability dependent on its rate .",
    "the second problem concerns the occurence of conflicts .",
    "these conflicts must be resolved but they make it impossible to have a synchronous update .    in this paper",
    "we introduce and study the partitioned ca model  @xcite .",
    "each site of the lattice belongs to a set of a partition .",
    "these sets are chosen such that reactions concerning sites within the same set have no conflicts .",
    "if we have , for example , a von neumann neighborhood  @xcite , the sites can be distributed over five sets with this property .",
    "the result is that updates in the same partition can be done simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the mathematical description of the simulation model .",
    "dmc simulation methods and algorithms are introduced in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we give the ca and its simulation algorithm .",
    "section 5 introduces the idea of partitioning worked out into several alternatives .",
    "section 6 contains some experimental data .",

    "occurrence of a reaction means that the particles in a small neighborhood of @xmath9 are replaced by new particles .",
    "a reaction can only occur when it is enabled , i.e. , when the neighborhood is occupied according to some specific pattern .",

    "we use the oscillations in the coverages with particles of the lattice for comparing our results .    because of the absence of conflicts between the chunks , the approach with partitions leads to a significant increase in speedup even for not so large systems ( 100x100 , 200x200 ) . in fig .",
    "[ speed ] we can see how the speedup of the pndca algorithm depends on the system size @xmath4 and on the number of processors @xmath59 .",
