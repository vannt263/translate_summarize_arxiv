    "in the unified schemes for radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , radio galaxies and quasars are deemed to be the same objects viewed from different lines of sight ( barthel 1989 ) .",
    "some of the best evidence to support such orientation - based unified schemes is provided by spectropolarimetry observations of radio galaxies that show broad permitted lines in the polarized spectrum , characteristic of scatter quasar light ( ogle et al .",
    "1997 , cohen et al . 1999 ) .",
    "a key element of the standard unified schemes is a central obscuring torus , with an axis parallel to the radio axis .",
    "this torus obscures structures close to the nucleus , such as the broad line region ( blr : @xmath14  pc , fwhm@xmath15 km s@xmath13 ) and the main optical / uv continuum generating region in the accretion disk .",
    "however , despite its status as a fundamental element of the unified scheme , large uncertainties remain about the structure of the torus and the degree of extinction it induces .",
    "apart from helping to clarify the apparent differences among radio - loud agns , the circum - nuclear dust and its spatial distribution are directly affected by phenomena occurring close to the nucleus , such as circum - nuclear outflows .",
    "hence , the study of the distribution and properties of the dust is important for understanding the impact of the nuclear activity on the host galaxies .    because agns are embedded in dusty regions and surrounded by a dust tori , observations at near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelengths are crucial , due to the relatively low extinction suffered at such wavelengths .",
    "the advantages of observing radio galaxies at near - ir wavelengths have been demonstrated by imaging observations of cygnus a ( djorgovski et al . 1991 ; tadhunter et al . 1999 ) and pks 0634 - 205 ( simpson , ward & wilson 1995 ) , which show a progression from resolved galaxy - like structures at short near - ir wavelengths , to unresolved point sources at longer wavelengths .",
    "these results have been interpreted in terms of the quasars shining through the obscuring dust torus . in this case",
    ", it should be possible to directly detect the blr associated with the agns at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "indeed , previous near - ir spectroscopic observations have shown that some radio galaxies originally classified as narrow line radio galaxies ( nlrg ) present a broad pa@xmath7 line in the @xmath16-band ( hill , goodrich & depoy 1996 ; holt et al .",
    "this provides evidence for a hidden broad emission line region and gives support to the orientation - based unified schemes .",
    "3c  433 ( @xmath0 ; schmidt 1965 ) is a powerful radio galaxy that has been classified as an nlrg at optical wavelengths ( koski 1978 ) , and shows signs of a young stellar population in its optical continuum emission ( wills et al .",
    "2002 , holt et al .",
    "2007 ) . with a radio structure comprising jet and knot structures close to the nucleus , as well as hot spots and distorted radio lobes on larger scales ( van breugel et al . 1983 ) , its fanaroff and riley ( fr ) classification is uncertain , but it is more commonly identified as an frii source .",
    "the existing optical hubble space telescope _ hst _",
    "images taken with the f702w filter show a complex central structure attributed to dust obscuration and possible star forming regions ( de koff et al .",
    "1996 ) , but no sign of an unresolved optical nucleus ( chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , 3c  433 has an unusually bright compact nuclear source at near - ir wavelengths ( madrid et al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as exceptionally red near - ir colours ( lilly , longair & miller 1985 ) . at mid - ir wavelengths ,",
    "spitzer observations of 3c  433 indicate the existence of a hidden quasar obscured by dust ( ogle et al .",
    "therefore , this object provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the nature of compact near - ir core sources in agns .    in this article",
    "we analyse photometric and polarimetric imaging observations of the nuclear region of 3c  433 obtained with the near infrared camera and multi object spectrograph ( nicmos ) on the _",
    "hst_. we also present near - ir spectra taken with the united kingdom imaging spectrometer ( uist ) integral field unit on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "these data allow us to examine the nature of the nuclear point source using a range of techniques : photometry , spectroscopy , and polarimetry .",
    "we analyse the results of these techniques together , and discuss them in the context of the orientation - based unified schemes .",
    "in  2 we describe the observations , as well as the data reduction procedures .",
    "we present the analysis in  3 , and in  4 we discuss the results in terms of the nature of the circum - nuclear structures . in  5 we present the conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters : @xmath17 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the _ hst _ images were obtained during cycle 13 on 2005 august 19 ( go  10410 , pi : c. n. tadhunter ) , using the nicmos1 camera ( nic1 ) with the f110w , f145 m , f170 m filters ( central wavelengths : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xmath23 m respectively ) , and with the nicmos2 ( nic2 ) camera using the pol - l filters centred at @xmath2 m . in the latter case three polarization filter images ( pol0l , pol120l and pol240l ) , whose principal axes of transmission are separated by @xmath24 ,",
    "were obtained to derive polarimetric information ; these were also co - added to form a deep @xmath25 m image .",
    "the observations were coordinated in a parallel way : observations of 3c  433 in nic1 were made when nic2 chopped to the sky . the standard x - strip - dither - chop pattern ( barker et al .",
    "2007 ) was used for the observations in order to facilitate accurate subtraction of the sky emission , with a total of 8 positions ( 4 sky , 4 object ) , a chop throw of @xmath26 arcsec ( in the y - direction ) , and a spacing between the dithering positions of @xmath27 arcsec ( in the x - direction ) .",
    "the total on - source integration time were 768 seconds at @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xmath23 m , and 624 seconds at @xmath2 m .",
    "the _ hst _ data were reduced using the standard nicmos calibration software * calnica * ( maclaughlin & wiklind 2007 ) . to obtain the polarization degree and position angle using the nic2 pol - l observations , the stokes parameters of the polarimetric data were calculated and analysed according to the prescription of sparks & axon ( 1999 ) , as follows .",
    "first , the mean and standard deviation of the intensity of each polarizer image were obtained through concentric apertures , centred in the galaxy s nucleus , using the iraf task * phot*. then , using an idl routine , we obtained the stokes parameters ( @xmath28 ) , by solving the matrix of the linear system for three polarizers .",
    "the transmission coefficients for the polarizers pol - l were derived from data taken with the post - nicmos cooling system ( batcheldor et al .",
    "finally , we derived our estimates of the polarized flux percentage ( @xmath29 ) and the position angles ( @xmath30 ) .      in order to search for broad hydrogen emission lines associated with the hidden agn",
    ", we have also analysed spectroscopic data taken with the uist integral field unit ( ifu ) imaging spectrometer on ukirt .",
    "the observations were obtained with the hk grism on 2003 september 16 .",
    "the air mass ranged from @xmath31 at the beginning of the observations , to @xmath32 at the end .",
    "the bandpass extended from @xmath33 m to @xmath34 m , and a mean velocity resolution of @xmath35 km s@xmath13 was achieved .",
    "the data were taken in the standard abba pattern , with the telescope nodding between the galaxy and sky positions .",
    "the ukirt data were reduced in the standard way using iraf .",
    "first we combined the galaxy and sky frames separately , using a median filter to remove cosmic rays ; then we subtracted sky from galaxy frames to correct for the sky emission , bias and dark current .",
    "residual hot pixels were removed using the * fixpix * task , and the spectra were wavelength calibrated using argon arc frames .",
    "the flux calibration was achieved by dividing by a wavelength calibrated spectrum of the type a0v atmospheric standard star hd34317 , observed close in time to the 3c  433 observations ; the air mass ranged from @xmath36 to @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the data were multiplied by the spectrum of a black body of temperature @xmath37 k to produce a flux and wavelength calibrated spectrum . the spectroscopic analysis presented below focusses on the combined spectrum for a @xmath38 arcsec aperture centred on the nucleus .",
    "at radio wavelengths 3c  433 is dominated by the extended radio jet and lobes , whereas at optical wavelengths it is dominated by the stellar light of the host galaxy , albeit with a disturbed morphology ( de koff et al .",
    "1996 ) and signs of recent star formation ( holt et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this work",
    ", on the other hand , we find that at near - ir wavelengths , 3c  433 has a bright unresolved point - like nucleus that clearly dominates over the host galaxy emission ( see fig . [ field ] ) . at @xmath25 m ,",
    "the nuclear source shows distinctly the prominent first airy ring , and also some signs of the second airy ring .",
    "this detection of an unresolved source makes it clear that , using near - ir observations , we are able to penetrate the circum - nuclear dust material . in addition , our @xmath2 m pol - l images also detect the nearby companion galaxies @xmath39 arcsec to the north - east , and @xmath40 arcsec to the north of 3c  433 ( see also van breugel et al .",
    "1983 ) , as well the fainter patch of emission @xmath41 arcsec to the north - west of 3c  433 , detected before by de koff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    to estimate the flux of the galaxy core at each wavelength , a trial and error subtraction of psfs generated by the tiny tim software ( krist & hook 2004 ) was performed .",
    "the artificial psfs were re - centred and scaled by different factors to obtain the best subtraction .",
    "we consider that the best factor is obtained when , after psf subtraction , the residual psf structure is minimised .",

    "hst_/nicmos images [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ a_v ]      despite the strength of the near - ir continuum from the unresolved agn , the ukirt spectrum of the nucleus shows no clear evidence for a strong broad pa@xmath7 line . after removing telluric absorption features ,",
    "a narrow pa@xmath7 ( @xmath42 m ) emission line is present at the expected redshifted wavelength ( @xmath43 m ; see fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) .",
    "this lack of a broad line is unexpected , and stands out for the following reasons .",
    "our near - ir results suggest that we are able to look through the dust torus directly into the agn .",
    "a strong broad pa@xmath7 line should thus be present .",
    "moreover , a prominent broad pa@xmath7 is detected in the spectra of other powerful radio galaxies with obscured quasar nuclei ( e.g. , pks 1549 - 79 ; holt et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "although we do not detect a broad pa@xmath7 line directly in our spectra , we can estimate the ranges of pa@xmath7 equivalent width ( ew ) and fwhm that are consistent with the non - detection .",
    "this was done by adding broad gaussian lines of various velocity widths ( fwhm@xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 km s@xmath13 ) and equivalent widths ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) to our spectrum at the expected wavelength of pa@xmath7 , and then examining whether the line could be clearly detected above the continuum upon visual inspection of the plots ( see fig .",
    "[ gaussians ] ) . note that the equivalent widths of the broad pa@xmath7 line in optically obscured and unobscured quasar nuclei generally fall in the range @xmath50 ew@xmath51 ( rudy & tokunaga 1982 , holt et al .",
    "2006 , landt et al .",
    "2008 ) .    on the basis of fig .",
    "[ gaussians ] , the non - detection of broad pa@xmath52 is favoured by a large fwhm and a small ew . if the agn in 3c  433 has a broad pa@xmath7 line with ew typical of the agns ( median ew@xmath53 : landt et al .",
    "2008 ) , its pa@xmath7 must have a velocity width @xmath54 km s@xmath13 to escape detection .",
    "such large velocity widths , while not typical of agns in general , are commonly measured in broad line radio - loud agns in the local universe , which have radio and emission line luminosities similar to 3c  433 ( e.g. the blrg in osterbrock , koski & phillips 1976 , buttiglione et al .",
    "therefore , the simplest explanation for the non - detected broad pa@xmath7 in 3c  433 is that it contains a typical blrg nucleus with fwhm@xmath54 km s@xmath13 .",
    "we have found that 3c  433 shows several interesting characteristics at near - ir wavelengths . in this section",
    "we summarize and discuss our results .    *",
    "an unresolved point - like nucleus is detected at all near - ir wavelengths .",
    "this source dominates over the starlight from the host galaxy in the @xmath2m - band .",
    "the strength of the nuclear point source suggests that we are looking directly at the agn through the circum - nuclear dust . *",
    "it is plausible that the kpc - scale dust lane that falls close to perpendicular to the inner radio jet ( @xmath55 ) forms the outer part of a torus structure responsible for the nuclear obscuration . *",
    "the extinction obtained using the different methods is consistent with a relatively modest obscuration of the nuclear point source ( @xmath10a@xmath11 mag ) , compared with the archetypical powerful radio galaxy cygnus  a ( tadhunter et al .",
    "* we have found that the spectrum of 3c  433 lacks a strong broad pa@xmath7 emission line .",
    "this is unexpected , because the ir images suggest that we are looking directly at the agn .",
    "however , it is plausible that the non - detection is due to the fact that 3c  433 has a pa@xmath7 line with a relatively large width ( fwhm@xmath56 km s@xmath13 ; typical of blrg ) , which makes it difficult to detect in our spectra .",
    "* the nucleus is highly polarized ( p@xmath57 per cent ) ; and the orientation of the polarization e - vector at near - ir wavelengths is close to perpendicular to the inner radio jet axis ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "+ the polarization of the near - ir light could be produced by three mechanisms : ( 1 ) non - thermal synchrotron radiation ; ( 2 ) scattering of the light due to dust or electrons ; or ( 3 ) dichroic extinction .",
    "+ at first sight , it might be thought that the lack of a broad pa@xmath7 line and the relatively high degree of polarization can be explained in terms of strong non - thermal synchrotron continuum emission swamping the emission lines at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "indeed , capetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have proposed a synchrotron origin for the optical polarization measured in the unresolved optical cores of a sample of 9 nearby fri radio galaxies .",
    "such interpretation is supported by the close correlations between the x - ray , optical and radio properties of the fri cores ( e.g. balmaverde , capetti & grandi 2006 ) . however , in 3c  433 a major contribution to the near - ir continuum emission from a synchrotron mechanism is unlikely for the following reasons .",
    "the seds produced by synchrotron radiation from flat spectrum core radio sources generally show significant declines  by orders of magnitude  between the radio and the near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. dicken et al . 2008 ) .",
    "a clear example is the quasar 3c  273 , for which the flat spectrum radio core is two orders of magnitude brighter than its near - ir core flux .",
    "moreover , the flat spectrum radio cores in lower - luminosity fri radio galaxies also have relatively steep spectra between radio and optical wavelengths ( @xmath59 , balmaverde , capetti & grandi 2006 ) .",
    "in contrast , a power - law fit between the radio core flux and the near - ir data for 3c  433 yields a flat or gently rising spectrum ( see fig . [ sed ] ) , with no decline between the radio and the near - ir wavelengths . given that this is difficult to reconcile with the steep radio - ir seds of known synchrotron dominated core sources , it is unlikely that synchrotron radiation substantially dilutes the broad pa@xmath7 feature .",
    "+ regarding scattering , we expect the scattered light to be polarized perpendicular to the radius vector from the illuminating source .",
    "we have found that the pa of the e - vector is close to parallel to the dust lane ( offset@xmath60 ) and perpendicular to the inner radio axis ( offset@xmath61 ) .",
    "therefore , we could be seeing the light scattered by the inner face of the torus on the far side of the nucleus , or polar scattering by material above the torus .",
    "potentially , scattered light could provide an alternative to explain the non - detection of broad pa@xmath7 line , since , if the scattering is by electrons and they are sufficiently hot ( @xmath62k ) , then a very broad pa@xmath7 line ( fwhm@xmath54 km s@xmath13 ) would not be detected in our spectroscopic data if it has an equivalent width typical of quasars .",
    "+ dichroic extinction is the selective attenuation of light passing through a medium with dust grains that are aligned by a magnetic field .",
    "it has been found that the efficiency of this mechanism is low : large quantities of dust are required to produce a reasonable degree of polarized light ( jones 1989 ) . in the case of 3c  433",
    ", the similarity between the extinction required to give the measured polarization at @xmath2 m and the other extinction estimates ( see table [ a_v ] ) provides strong evidence for a dichroic origin of the polarization .",
    "if this is the case , since the e - vector of the polarized light is aligned perpendicular to the radio axis , the dust grains in the torus must be aligned perpendicular to the torus plane and , therefore , the magnetic field must be parallel to the dust torus ( i.e. , the magnetic field is toroidal ) .",
    "this scheme requires the presence of elongated dust grains and the existence of a highly coherent magnetic fields in the torus .",
    "indeed , for the dichroic mechanism to work the polarization efficiency is required to be close to the upper limit of that measured for stars in our galaxy ( jones 1989 ) .",
    "this can be explained in terms of the fact that the circum - nuclear torus is likely to be more compact and coherent structure than the large - scale disk of the milky way .",
    "+ it is also interesting to compare our results for 3c  433 with those obtained for cygnus  a , the only other powerful radio source to have its near - ir core source investigated in such detail .",
    "we have re - calculated the optical extinction in cygnus  a using the various methods applied in 3c  433 , and tabulated the results in table [ a_v ] . by method ( 2 ) we obtain a@xmath63 mag , given the nuclear x - ray luminosity in ueno et al .",
    "this optical extinction is slightly higher than the reported in tadhunter et al .",
    "( 1999 ; @xmath64 mag ) , because the x - ray luminosity given by ueno et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is higher than the one taken in tadhunter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . by method ( 3 ) we estimate a@xmath65 mag , given the column density of n@xmath66 @xmath67 ( ueno et al .",
    "1994 ) , and by applying the arguments of maiolino et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we get a@xmath68 mag . the intrinsic near - ir polarization measured in the unresolved core of cygnus  a is p@xmath69 per cent , with an offset of @xmath70 between the radio jet and the e - vector ( tadhunter et al .",
    "2000 ) . under the assumptions of method ( 4 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath50a@xmath71 mag . + its notable that the ratio of ir polarization to visual extinction estimated using methods ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) covers a similar range for cygnus a ( @xmath72p@xmath73a@xmath74 ) and for 3c  433 ( @xmath75p@xmath76a@xmath77 ) .",
    "the fact that there is evidence for higher extinction in the case of cygnus  a helps to explain why its near - ir core source is relatively fainter than that detected in 3c  433 .",
    "+ additional polarimetry observations at other near- and mid - ir wavelengths could help to distinguish among the three polarization mechanism mentioned above .",
    "in particular , comparison of our polarimetric measurements at @xmath2 m with those at both longer and shorter wavelengths could be used to distinguish between the scattering and dichroic polarization mechanisms . in the case of electron or optically thick dust scattering",
    "we expect the polarization to show little variations across the near- and mid - ir bands , whereas the dichroic mechanism will produce a significant decline between @xmath78 and @xmath79 bands , following the serkowski law ( serkowski 1973 ) .",
    "we have used _ hst _ and ukirt observations to study 3c  433 at near - ir wavelengths , and have found several interesting features .",
    "the near - ir observations suggest that we are viewing the agn directly through an obscuring dust structure perpendicular to the radio jets , or indirectly via scattering by a region close to the nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , the near - ir spectrum of the source shows a lack of broad lines .",
    "however , the estimated level of extinction ( @xmath10a@xmath11 mag ) and high intrinsic polarization of the nucleus ( @xmath8 per cent ) support the idea that the high polarization may be due to dichroic extinction by a magnetised torus structure in the nuclear region of the galaxy .",
    "it is now important to extend such studies to larger samples , in order to determine whether the polarization and extinction properties of 3c  433 are typical of the general population of powerful radio galaxies .",
