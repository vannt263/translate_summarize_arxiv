    "most coatings are made by depositing a volatile liquid that contains dispersed colloidal particles on a surface .",
    "the liquid is then evaporated until a dry film is obtained .",
    "common examples in industrial fields are paints , protective coatings ( anti - corrosion ) , ceramic membranes @xcite .",
    "coatings are required to be homogeneous and smooth .",
    "particularly they have to be free of heterogeneities possibly leading to cracking due to high stresses developing during the consolidation . in a liquid film ,",
    "evaporation of the volatile solvent causes the solid particles to be confined into a smaller volume , until they come into direct contact with each other , and form a solid porous network , so called gel @xcite .",
    "then , further evaporation causes the liquid / air interface to curve into a set of menisci that join the particles . as a consequence",
    "the capillary forces exert extremely strong compressive stress on the particle network .",
    "when the drying stress development in the gel exceeds the strength of the material , undesirable effects occur such as the formation of various modes of cracking@xcite . as a consequence",
    "the stress in the gel is relaxed . since numerous studies on cracks induced by drying of colloidal suspensions",
    "have been investigated for the last two decades , the stress development and the organization of colloidal particles in a drying film remain unclear .",
    "one of the main questions that still stands : how can the stress be relaxed before cracks can form ?",
    "in addition , the development of stresses , hence of cracking notably depends on the type of the particles ( size@xcite , chemical composition@xcite ) and mechanical properties of the gel formed ( @xcite ) , the substrate , the drying conditions ( temperature@xcite , relative humidity@xcite , air velocity@xcite ) and the film thickness@xcite .",
    "in particular the capacity of a gel network to crack during drying depends on the existence and significance of a pressure gradient in the pore liquid and the way the gel relaxes the induced drying stresses .",
    "in the present work , we focus on the effect of cosolvent added to the colloidal dispersion on crack patterns induced by drying .",
    "such additive reveals crack - free drying when added to ceramic foams@xcite .",
    "glycerol has been chosen as a cosolvent for interesting properties of high miscibility in water , low volatility , and because it exhibits a highly different intrinsic diffusion coefficient from that of water .",
    "also glycerol is an element composing many essential fine arts products@xcite : due to its transparency properties and because it is used as a softener , avoiding creases and cracks .",
    "crack patterns have been quantified as a function of the added glycerol content .",
    "drying kinetics have been investigated by mass variation with time measurements .",
    "also mechanical properties of colloidal gels are measured by indentation testing as a function of the added cosolvent content .",
    "experimental results can be explained by the combination of two processes occuring during the drying process : flow driven by the pressure gradient accordingly with darcy law and diffusion mechanism accordingly with fick law .",
    "we used colloidal silica dispersion , ludox hs-40 purchased from sigma - aldrich .",
    "the radius of the particles is @xmath1 nm , the density @xmath2 kg / m@xmath3 .",
    "the mass fraction of the initial dispersion was estimated to @xmath4% by a dry extract .",
    "thus , we could deduce the particle volume fraction for this solution to be @xmath5% .",
    "particles are polydisperse enough not to crystallize . in the absence of evaporation ,",
    "the suspension is stable due to the competition between the attractive van der waals forces and the electrostatic repulsion@xcite between particles ( ph = @xmath6 ) .",
    "glycerol ( purity : @xmath7% , from merck ) was added to the aqueous dispersion as a cosolvent .",
    "this solvent exhibits high miscibility properties in water and low vapor pressure ( @xmath8 mbar at @xmath9c)@xcite compared to water ( @xmath10 mbar ) .",
    "thus , we assume glycerol as a non - volatile compound .",
    "the surface tension of pure glycerol is @xmath11mn / m at @xmath12c @xcite .",
    "glycerol / water weight ratio was prepared using the following process : the resulting solution was filtered to @xmath13  @xmath14 m to eliminate eventual aggregates ; the mass fraction is estimated by a dry extract at @xmath15c . in order to keep the particle mass fraction constant for each sample , a given quantity of water is evaporated , then replaced by an equal mass of glycerol ; the evaporation of water is achieved by stirring the aqueous dispersion at @xmath16c in an erlenmeyer .",
    "finally , we checked the final ph of the solution .",
    "we note @xmath17 the ratio between the mass of glycerol added and the mass of the resulting dispersion .",
    "six solutions have been investigated : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 wt .",
    "this leads to glycerol fraction in solvent denoted by @xmath25 ( the subscript stands for initial ) . in the range of glycerol content",
    "added , the solvent viscosity increases until @xmath26 mpa.s .",
    "experiments are performed on films of fixed thickness .",
    "also a small amount of the solution ( initial weight @xmath27 g ) is deposited inside a circular container ( diameter @xmath28 mm ) whose bottom is a glass microscope slide carefully cleaned with ethanol and the lateral wall is a rigid rubber ring ( figure [ fig : setup ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the contact line of the solution is quenched at the upper edge of the circular wall and remains there during the whole experiment . in this geometry",
    "the layer dries at room temperature ( @xmath29c ) under controlled relative humidity ( @xmath30 ) . in this way , the desiccation takes place in the absence of convection in the vapor so that the evaporation is limited by diffusion of the solvent into the air .",
    "the drying kinetics is obtained using a scale ( sartorius ) with an accuracy of @xmath31 mg . when the gelled phase is formed , the layer exhibits an approximately constant thickness in a central region ( figure [ fig : setup ] ( a ) ) . in this region , covering about @xmath32 of the total surface area , the evaporation is assumed to be uniform .",
    "a typical value of the thickness far from the border is @xmath33 mm .",
    "the colloidal gel is transparent allowing us to observe easily the dynamics of crack patterns in the layer .",
    "also the crack patterns formation is recorded using an interval timer with an avt s marlin camera positioned on the top of the sample .      to characterize the mechanical properties of the gelled layers relevant elastic modulus , @xmath34 , has been performed by indentation testing .",
    "this quantity has been determined using a csm instruments micro indentation tester ( mht ) with a four - sided pyramidal vickers indenter .",
    "indentation testing is a local method of mechanical investigation .",
    "the indenter , initially in contact with the surface of the gel , is driven in the material until a maximal @xmath35 mn load with a loading speed @xmath35 mn / min . the maximal force is held during @xmath36 s. then , the load is decreased until zero with the same speed .",
    "figure [ fig : colloid_e]a shows a typical load / unload curve .",
    "the standard way of estimating the elastic modulus from the indentation load - displacement curve uses the initial slope of the unloading curve . based on sneddon work @xcite ,",
    "the following formula has been derived for the elastic modulus , @xmath34 , to the unloading slope",
    "@xcite :    @xmath37    in this equation , @xmath38 is the slope of the unloading curve at the start of unloading , and @xmath39 is the projected area of contact between the indenter and the material at that point ( inset in figure [ fig : colloid_e]a ) .",
    "note that the contact between the indenter and the gel is always chosen in a location where the layer adheres on the substrate . in the case of successive measurements of the elastic modulus with time",
    ", indentation testing was performed in the same adhering region to obtain comparable values as effectively as possible .",
    "particularly , the difficulties of these measurements lie in gel films without glycerol addition exhibiting the smallest size of adhering regions . indeed it has been observed that glycerol reduces the capacity of the gel to delaminate .",
    "in addition indentation testing applied to drying gelled layers has to be carefully analyzed since the system is not homogeneous in the thickness and evolves with time .",
    "also measurements of elastic moduli in gels by this way do not give absolute values but provide on the one hand a process of comparing mechanical properties of different materials , on the other hand a characterization of the time evolution of the mechanical properties of the system .",
    "therefore measurements for the elastic modulus have been reproduced several times and performed on 2 or 3 samples ; bars in figure [ fig : colloid_e]b take into account the minimum and maximum measurements obtained .",
    "once the layer is deposited in the circular trough , evaporation of the water takes place .",
    "the drying process of a colloidal dispersion is usually separated into two stages , that can be roughly distinguished by measuring mass , @xmath40 , and drying rate , @xmath41 , variations with time ( figure [ fig : masse])@xcite . in the first regime ( constant rate period )",
    "the evaporation rate is constant and evaporation is mainly controlled by the external conditions of relative humidity and temperature in the surroundings . during this stage ,",
    "water removal concentrates the colloidal particles into a closed packed array : a porous network saturated with solvent . due to geometry of the planar film , evaporation at the gel - air interface and adhesion at the gel - substrate interface result in the development of high stresses in the gel ( figure [ fig : setup](b ) ) .",
    "capillary pressure that is caused by the liquid menisci formed between the particles at the top of the packed region is responsible for the shrinkage of the porous network .",
    "the shrinkage of the gel at the gel - air interface is frustrated by the adhesion to the substrate . as a consequence",
    "tensile stresses progressively build up in the layer .",
    "then a non - linear drying rate follows : the falling rate period , when liquid / air interfaces recede into the porous medium and when the drying process is limited by flow of liquid to the top layer through the porosity .",
    "the transient between the constant rate period and the falling rate period is highlighted in the lower inset in figure [ fig : masse ] : it shows the drying rate derivative @xmath42 . in our experimental conditions",
    "we observe that the transient always occurs at @xmath43s in the studied @xmath17 range . consequently the drying rate decreases as clearly shown in figure [ fig : masse ] .",
    "similar behaviors occur when glycerol content is added to the aqueous dispersion ( figure [ fig : masse ] ) .      as the tensile stress reaches a threshold value",
    ", cracks appear in the film and invade the plane of the layer .",
    "first cracks appear at @xmath44$]s after deposition of the layer on the substrate , without any correlation with the glycerol concentration nor the initial mass disparity .",
    "moreover the cracks invade the layer during only a few minutes .",
    "thus the crack network develops during the initial stage of the drying process , in constant rate period [ fig : masse ] , and does not evolve afterwards . plot in inset in figure [ fig : masse_fin ] shows the ratio , @xmath45 , of the final ( at @xmath46s ) and the initial mass of material on the glass plate ( raw data ) .",
    "futhermore , we know that silica particles contributes to @xmath47% of the mass . thus , the excess of mass is due to the solvent .",
    "as previously mentioned only water could evaporate and glycerol remains in the porous medium .",
    "also we can calculate the mass fraction of glycerol @xmath48 composing the solvent when the mass variations with time do not evolve anymore ( @xmath49s ) :    @xmath50    we found that the higher the initial fraction @xmath17 is , the higher @xmath48 reaches ( see inset of figure [ fig : masse_fin ] ) , leading to a saturation of glycerol in the gel for @xmath51 in accordance with the fit .",
    "crack patterns are strongly modified by the presence of a glycerol within the solvent . indeed , in the case of a silica gel without additional glycerol , the successive formation of cracks results in the typical pattern shown in figure [ fig : patterns]a .",
    "this pattern is usually continued by further crack generations : particularly delamination process takes place when the gel detaches from the substrate @xcite .",
    "moreover final crack patterns are shown in figure [ fig : patterns]a , b , c , d for increasing glycerol concentrations @xmath17 up to @xmath52 in our experimental conditions .",
    "for each pattern , cracks still interconnect leading to complete network : no broken network is observable suggesting that if crack nucleation is less favourable in presence of additional glycerol , crack propagation is still not inhibited . the number of cracks generated diminishes when the quantity of additional glycerol increases ; this results in increasing the crack spacing as shown in figure [ fig : patterns]e .",
    "figure [ fig : patterns]f shows a magnification of a typical crack tip propagating in a gel with glycerol content .",
    "the sharpness of this crack tip , also observed for every @xmath53 , suggests that the gel still exhibits brittleness properties .",
    "in addition buckle - driven delamination process , that usually takes place after the formation of a crack network , is inhibited by increasing additional glycerol concentration in the gel .    above a threshold concentration of additional glycerol ,",
    "the layer remains crack free ( figure [ fig : patterns]d ) : no crack forms because the gel could not reach the compaction ( or the threshold stress ) for which cracks propagate .",
    "it results in a flat gel film saturated in glycerol .      ) .",
    "insets : variation of the applied force versus time ; image of indentation print at the surface of the gel after a loading / unloading cycle observed using optical microscopy ( maximum load : @xmath54 , bar @xmath55 ) : the dashed square limit the projected area of contact , @xmath39 .",
    "( b ) variation of the elastic modulus , @xmath34 , for seven glycerol - ludox solutions .",
    "( c ) variation of the elastic modulus , @xmath34 , as a function of time for ludox hs-40 without glycerol addition ( @xmath56 ) and for two different concentrations of glycerol ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "measurements start after crack propagation , @xmath58 . ]",
    "the macroscopic elastic response of the gel is characterized by indentation testing for various binary mixtures of solvents ( figure [ fig : colloid_e ] ) .",
    "based on the procedure depicted in figure [ fig : colloid_e]a , elastic moduli have been measured for gels of various glycerol contents . each measurement has been obtained @xmath59 hours after the cracks formation since the gel evolves slowly after this duration ( figure [ fig : masse ] ) .",
    "measurements in figure [ fig : colloid_e]b reveal that an increase of the quantity of glycerol in the gel results in a decrease of its elastic modulus .",
    "since glycerol remains inside the porous medium , it could act as a wetting agent lowering the material stiffness .",
    "the elastic modulus of silica gels has been measured as a function of time during the drying process ; measurements started after crack propagation , @xmath58 .",
    "these measurements are shown for the silica gel without any glycerol addition and for two glycerol contents in figure [ fig : colloid_e]c . in any cases ,",
    "gel films clearly stiffens as they consolidate with time ; for the silica gel without any glycerol addition , this process is more rapid than in presence of glycerol content .",
    "two factors could contribute to increase the modulus as a function of time : stiffening of the solid phase of the gel and reduction in the porosity @xcite .",
    "also the elastic modulus increases faster for gels having lower concentrations of glycerol .",
    "the capacity of a gel to crack during drying depends on the existence and significance of a pressure gradient in the pore liquid .",
    "indeed the spatial variation in pressure causes a variation in contraction of the gel network @xcite .",
    "this modifies the way the drying stresses are relaxed and consequently the crack are formed . in the following the spatial variation in pressure in the liquid pore is characterized in gels saturated by binary mixtures of solvents during the first drying regime since cracks form during this stage .",
    "particularly we have chosen to compare the pressure distribution for different glycerol contents at time @xmath60s . at this moment , close to the typical cracking time of the gelled layers , gels can be considered as non - shrinking , that is the gel network does not change during time@xcite ; pores contain the binary mixture of solvents and the liquid - air interfaces are already curved .    in drying gels",
    ", liquid usually moves through the network in response to a pressure gradient of liquid , @xmath61 , accordingly to the darcy law@xcite .",
    "also , in the case of a gel saturated with a single volatile solvent , the flux of evaporating liquid at the gel - air interface comes entirely from flow of liquid .",
    "it expresses as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the network permeability of the gel , and @xmath64 is the dynamic viscosity of the solvent in the pore ; note that the pressure of the liquid pore is regarded as positive .",
    "let us now consider the incorporation of a soluble and non - volatile cosolvent , i.e. glycerol , to the aqueous dispersion .",
    "the drying process leads to a gel phase saturated by a binary mixture of water and glycerol .",
    "this results in a combination of the pressure flow component ( [ e.2 ] ) and a diffusion mechanism@xcite . in that way",
    ", the diffusive flux for each component , @xmath65 , expresses in accordance with the fick law :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the intrinsic diffusion coefficient refers in terms of the rate of transfer of component @xmath65 across a fixed section .",
    "note that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are time dependent .",
    "the total fluid flux in the porous network combines the flow driven by the pressure gradient ( [ e.2 ] ) and the diffusive flux ( [ e.3 ] ) . also , the relative change in volume of liquid over time , @xmath70 , is due to the change in both local flow , @xmath71 , and local diffusion flux , @xmath72 . as a result",
    "the following conservation equation can be written@xcite :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the relative density of the gel , @xmath75 denotes the porosity of the gel , @xmath76 is the diffusive flux of component @xmath65 , stating @xmath77 for water and @xmath78 for glycerol .",
    "since the change in the volume of liquid has to equal the change in pore volume , the following relation can be written in accordance with reference@xcite :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is a function of the poisson ratio of the gel and @xmath81 denotes the time derivative of the pressure . also the flux from the gel surface",
    "equals the rate of change in volume of the gel ; this expresses as @xmath82 for a layer of thickness @xmath83 accordingly to reference@xcite . here",
    "the evaporation rate , @xmath84 , determines the rate of volume loss by water evaporation .    by equating the right sides of expressions [ e.4 ] and [ e.5 ] and taking into account relations [ e.2 ] and [ e.3 ] ,",
    "it comes :    @xmath85    equation [ e.6 ] reveals that the diffusion mechanism can become significant only when the intrinsic diffusion coefficients of cosolvents are sufficiently different from each other .",
    "note that equation [ e.6 ] is only valid in the case of a solvent made of two components : in the case of a pure solvent , the diffusive term ( second term of the right side ) disappears and the flow is only governed by the darcy law . applying equation [ e.6 ] to our system allows us to plot the pressure in a pore liquid of the gel for different glycerol contents . in that purpose",
    "the concentration of component 1 ( water ) , @xmath86 , has to be incorporated in equation [ e.6 ] ; @xmath86 satisfies the diffusion equation using the boundary condition of constant flux at the evaporation surface , that expresses as ( reference@xcite p. 61 ) : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the mean concentration of water in the layer defined as : @xmath89 at time @xmath90 .    as a result",
    "an estimation of each quantity of equation [ e.6 ] from the experimental results is required .",
    "@xmath91 is precisely estimated from the inset in figure [ fig : masse_fin ] . in the first drying regime",
    ", @xmath84 can be measured from the mass variation with time in figure [ fig : masse ] ( @xmath92 m / s ) .",
    "the values of the intrinsic coefficients are obtained from reference @xcite : @xmath93 .",
    "the porosity @xmath75 is roughly estimated to @xmath94 for the random close - packed phase while @xmath95 ( reference @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the permeability of the gel keeps a constant value during the crack formation ; this quantity is estimated using the carman - kozeny relation ( @xmath96)@xcite . finally the elastic moduli of gels composed with various glycerol contents have been estimated from experimental results shown in figure [ fig : colloid_e](b ) and ( c ) extrapolating values a short time after cracking .",
    "consequently , the concentration distribution @xmath86 and the pressure , @xmath68 , are plotted along liquid pores at time @xmath90 in figure [ fig : scherer ] for different glycerol contents .",
    "the flattening of the pressure gradient when the concentration of glycerol increases is clearly observable and is mainly attributed to the diffusion mechanism .",
    "one should note that the reduction in the capillary forces near the surface should be of minor importance as the surface tension from one mixture to another varies only from @xmath97mn / m to @xmath98mn / m @xcite .",
    "these results highlight the effect of the addition of a non - volatile solvent to the pressure in the liquid pore since diffusion can extract liquid from the interior and flatten the pressure gradient in the pore liquid .",
    "the pressure gradient causes a shrinkage that is transmitted in the hard particles network . in the present paper , the adhesion with the substrate",
    "is assumed to be a constant and to play a determinant role as responsible for the development of high stresses in the gel@xcite .",
    "nevertheless the adhesion is seen as a necessary but not sufficient condition for cracking .",
    "thus we eliminate cracking by modifying the pressure gradient and keeping constant the adhesion . the increase of glycerol content , through diffusion process , will imply that the resulting drying stresses will be distributed more uniformly in the gel .",
    "consequently , the stress concentration in the gel network is limited and the crack formation can be inhibited .",
    "the effect of addition of glycerol content results in the flattening of the pressure gradient in the pore liquid due to a diffusion process as depicted by equation [ e.6 ] , for a constant value of the elastic modulus .",
    "moreover , the effect of addition of glycerol content results in the tendency of a decrease of the elastic modulus of the gel . as",
    "a consequence a decrease of the elastic modulus in equation [ e.6 ] leads to a flattening of the pressure gradient , and , in that sense , emphasizes the effect of diffusion .",
    "the incorporation of a small percentage of non - volatile cosolvent modifies the way the drying stresses relaxe in a colloidal gel .",
    "experimental data show that the drying rate and cracking time is not significantly modified by incorporation of the cosolvent .",
    "however the presence of non - volatile decreases the stiffness of the gel at a given consolidation time and inhibits crack formation : incorporation of a concentration of glycerol greater than @xmath0 in the colloidal dispersion results in a crack free drying gel .",
    "the mechanism is shown to be due to the combination of both flow driven by the pressure gradient and diffusion of solvent into a another ; in this scenario the diffusion induced by evaporation causes a demixing effect of solvents .",
    "this results in a flattening of the pressure gradient in the pore liquid and consequently the distribution of the drying stresses is more uniform , limiting stress concentration in the gel network possibly cause of cracking .",
    "moreover , the effect of a cosolvent added to a silica dispersion on the crack pattern has been highlighted in the case of glucose .",
    "as in the case of glycerol , the presence of glucose in the gel film reveals an increase of the crack spacing .",
    "however , contrary to the case of glycerol , cracks are not completely inhibited above a threshold glucose content : the crack spacing tends to a maximum value ( typically @xmath99 cm in the same experimental conditions as for glycerol cosolvent ) .    finally , the effect of the flattening of the pressure gradient is surely not the only process leading to the diminution of the number of cracks in the gel film .",
    "particularly chemical effects between glycerol and silanol groups covering the surfaces of silica particles could change the strength of the gel film .",
    "this process is suggested by aggregation rate measurements of silica particles with polyols@xcite and would be of interest for further works applied to gel film cracks induced by desiccation with chemical additives .",

    "in addition we thank the referees for their valuable comments which improved the consistancy of the manuscript ."
