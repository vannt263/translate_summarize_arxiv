    "grb970228 is the first gamma - ray burst ( grb ) for which a counterpart at longer wavelengths has been detected , and extensive follow - up observations of it have been made .",
    "grb970228 was detected by the bepposax satellite on 1997 february 28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent bepposax follow - up observations revealed a rapidly fading x - ray source ( @xcite ) .",
    "later , asca ( @xcite ) and rosat ( @xcite , 1998 ) observations showed that it continued to fade in x - rays over a two week period .",
    "ten days after the burst , groot et al .",
    "( 1997a ) announced the detection of a fading source which was the first optical counterpart of a grb .",
    "frenetic activity followed , with new observations being taken and previous ones being reanalyzed , which led to reports of several detections in the optical and near infrared ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations with the hubble space telescope made another startling discovery .",
    "the fading grb afterglow was spatially coincident with an extended source ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wijers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and reichart ( 1997 ) discussed early observations of grb970228 in the context of theoretical models .",
    "they found that the behavior of the grb afterglow was consistent with the expectations of relativistic fireball models .",
    "in one of the simplest models , the afterglow power - law temporal decay is simply related to its power - law spectrum by a factor of 1.5 , which was consistent with the early measurements that were being reported .",
    "later , galama et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) compiled the most relevant photometric measurements of grb970228 , converting them into a single photometric band when necessary and subtracting the contribution of the extended source component .",
    "they fit the optical transient temporal evolution to a power - law with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 for 9 degrees of freedom ) .    for the first time , temporal , as well as spatial , coincidence could be used to associate x - ray and optical sources with grbs . since then several other grb afterglows have been detected and monitored , and it now seems firmly established that these fading x - ray and optical sources are counterparts of the bursts . in this paper",
    ", we determine the galactic extinction towards grb970228 , performing a careful analysis of the publicly available observations .",
    "the goal we have in mind is to better understand the intrinsic properties of this afterglow . in a companion paper ( @xcite ) , we discuss the implications of our measurements for the properties and nature of the point - like and extended optical sources coincident with the fading x - ray source .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we utilize various methods to measure the extinction at optical wavelengths . in ",
    "2 we describe a photometric method : we compute the galaxy number counts in the grb970228 hst wfpc2 observations and compare them to the number counts in the hubble deep field ( hdf ; @xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we describe spectroscopic methods that use the keck ii observations made by tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in ",
    "3.1 we measure the balmer series emission lines of a galaxy 64  away from the grb and estimate the extinction from the observed relative intensities of these emission lines . in ",
    "3.2 we use three stars that lie 2.9  , 16.8  and 42.7  away from the grb .",
    "we determine their spectral types and compute the extinction value required to make their measured spectral energy distributions consistent with their spectral types .",
    "secondly , we estimate the extinction from measurements of the column density of hydrogen gas and dust emission measurements , using established correlations . in ",
    "4 we utilize hydrogen column density measures and in  5 the infrared 100 dust emission .",
    "we discuss our results in  6 and present our conclusions in  7 .",
    "galaxy number counts can be used to measure directly the relative extinction between two fields .",
    "the idea is simple .",
    "the observed apparent optical magnitude of a galaxy is increased ( the flux is decreased ) because its radiation is absorbed by material , normally dust for optical extinction , along the line of sight . because the number of observed galaxies increases with magnitude",
    ", number counts are reduced if extinction is present . ignoring possible deviations due to galaxy clustering and sampling effects , in a given magnitude range and in a given filter",
    ", the number of galaxies should be the same irrespective of direction .",
    "galaxy number counts are normally approximated as    @xmath3    where the values of the normalization , @xmath4 , and the slope , @xmath5 , depend on the specific filter and magnitude range .",
    "however , due to extinction , the observed apparent magnitude will be increased to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , if we compare two different fields with extinctions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , their relative number counts in the same observed apparent magnitude range will be    @xmath9    one can assume that the normalizations and slopes are the same , if the galaxy number counts are measured in the same unextinguished apparent magnitude range and in the same filter .",
    "if we additionally assume that surface brightness dimming effects do not alter the relative number counts , then the ratio of the number counts depends only on the relative extinction and common slope    @xmath10    in the present case we wish to estimate the extinction towards grb970228 by comparing the number counts of the grb wfpc2 hst observations with those of another field of known extinction .",
    "we have chosen the hubble deep field ( @xcite ) because it is the best studied and deepest field for which the extinction is already known , having been observed with the same instrument .",
    "grb970228 was observed by hst on 1997 march 26th and april 7th . in both observations",
    "the optical counterpart was centered in the middle of the pc1 ccd , but there was a 2.40 deg difference in rotation angle between the first and second observations . at both epochs ,",
    "four exposures were taken in the f606w filter and two exposures in the f814w filter , totalling 4700 and 2400 seconds , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hdf was observed for 109050 and 123600 seconds in the f606w and f814w filters respectively ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "our starting point was the hst archive , from which we retrieved the observations of both fields . after the standard pipeline reduction , we combined the different exposures at each epoch of the grb970228 field using the iraf / stsdas task crrej .",
    "then the combined second epoch image was rotated according to the difference in the orientat header keyword and shifted using sub - pixel shifts and fourth - order polynomial interpolation , according to the measured centroid positions of stars .",
    "subsequently , both epochs were combined using the iraf task imcombine , rejecting pixels that were deviant from the median by more than 5 sigma , the noise being characterized by the square root of the median plus the square of the read - out noise . however , for this last step to be effective the sky values had to be rescaled because the direction of the april 7th observations was closer to the sun than was the direction of the previous ones , and the images had background count values approximately 25% higher .",
    "this last rejection process affected only @xmath110.12% and @xmath110.35% of the pixels in the f606w and f814w images , respectively .",
    "the hdf images retrieved had already been processed and no further reduction was done .    in order to reduce the systematic errors in selecting galaxies and measuring their magnitudes , we chose to analyze both fields using the same procedures .",
    "we used the sextractor image analysis package ( @xcite ) to automatically detect and measure object magnitudes .",
    "the magnitude zero points were computed using the photflam and photzpt image header keywords , taking into account the different effective gains of the four wfpc2 ccds ( @xcite ) .",
    "these st magnitudes were converted to ab magnitudes using the transformations : @xmath12 and @xmath13 . after generating catalogs of extracted objects and their magnitudes ,",
    "all objects brighter than @xmath14 and @xmath15 were visually inspected and spurious objects were removed .",
    "this process was crucial in the f814w image of the grb970228 field because combining only four exposures precluded an accurate rejection of `` hot pixels '' .",
    "the different rotation angles between the march 26 and april 7 images of the grb970228 field and the small dithering in the hdf made it necessary to exclude the edges of the ccd fields as well . after generating the catalogs",
    ", we compared our galaxy number counts in the hdf field with those obtained by the hdf team , in order to check our object selection criteria and our magnitude measurements .",
    "the galaxy number counts in both filter images were consistent with each other .    in order to estimate the relative extinction between the two fields , we utilize a maximum likelihood method .",
    "we construct a joint likelihood function that is the product of four likelihoods , each one being the likelihood that a given galaxy catalogue with its measured magnitudes and errors resembles a power - law distribution ( see equation  1 ) in a given magnitude range .",
    "the four likelihood functions correspond to @xmath16 and @xmath17 images of the two fields .",
    "therefore our joint likelihood function has 8 parameters : the normalizations and slopes in each of the four combinations of images and filters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) . however , if we analyze the catalogues in the same unextinguished apparent magnitude range ( which requires us to know the extinction a priori ; see equation  3 ) , we can assume that the slopes are the same in the hdf and grb970228 fields in a given filter image , and that the normalizations are therefore related by    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    if we further assume that the extinction behaves like extinction law typical of the interstellar medium ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we can impose a further constraint by integrating the extinction law with the filter responses    @xmath30    @xmath31    then the joint likelihood function has only 5 parameters : two slopes , two normalizations , and the difference in the extinction .",
    "we can marginalize this likelihood function over both normalizations ( f606w and f814w ) and use the measured value of the extinction in the hdf field , @xmath32 ( @xcite ) , in order to reduce the maximization required to three parameters ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", we need to know _ a priori _ the value of the extinction in order to choose the magnitude ranges for which our parameter reduction is valid .",
    "therefore , we proceed in the following iterative way .",
    "we start by choosing a value for the extinction ( a good initial guess can be made by comparing the counts in different magnitudes ranges ) .",
    "we then correct the observed magnitudes for that extinction value and plot the resulting cumulative number counts distributions .",
    "since the hdf field has longer exposures and goes much deeper , we can compute the extinction - corrected magnitude at which the grb970228 field counts start to be incomplete , compared to the hdf field . plotting the cumulative number counts of both extinction - corrected datasets",
    "gives a good indication where the incompleteness starts to affect the grb970228 field .",
    "we adopt as our faint limiting magnitude the magnitude at which the cumulative counts deviate by more than 10% in the f606w filter and 15% in the f814w filter ( the errors in the computed magnitudes are larger in the f814w filter and that is why the deviation allowed is larger as well ) .",
    "note that the deviation in the f814w filter depends on the bright magnitude limit adopted as the hsd and grb counts differ at the lower @xmath17 magnitudes measured ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we also check the probability as a function of limiting magnitude that both cumulative magnitude distributions are drawn from the same parent distributions , using the ks test . at",
    "our adopted cut and taking into account our bright magnitude limit as well , the hypothesis that the two count distributions come from the same parent distribution can not be rejected at even the @xmath36 confidence level .",
    "once we have determined the limiting extinction - corrected magnitude , we use it , without the extinction correction , as the faintest magnitude down to which we compute the joint likelihood function .",
    "we take as the bright magnitude limit the magnitude at which the number counts fall below @xmath37 mag@xmath38 deg@xmath39 ( @xmath1110 objects per magnitude in the whole wfpc2 area ) .",
    "we then maximize the likelihood function and obtain the best - fit values for the slopes and the extinction . starting with this new value for the extinction , we iterate until the process converges .",
    "it is worth noting that our final value for the extinction is almost independent of the bright magnitude limit adopted .",
    "the exact faint magnitude limit adopted does not affect the final value of extinction either , because we perform a correction for possible incompleteness _ a posteriori _",
    "( see below ) .",
    "+    figure  1 illustrates our results .",
    "after a few iterations , we obtain values for the extinction and number counts slopes of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the magnitude ranges used are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "so far we have neglected any possible effects introduced by the dimming of the surface brightnesses of galaxies due to the optical extinction . in the present case , the grb field",
    "is considerably obscured compared to the hdf and therefore low surface brightness objects could be missed in the grb field because they fall below the detection limit when they should have been included in the magnitude limits considered .",
    "this effect would lead to an overestimation of the extinction . in order to correct for it ,",
    "we simulate wfpc2 fields by degrading the wfpc2 hdf images according to several values of the extinction and then carry out the same analysis on these simulated images as we have on the grb field images . according to our simulations , we overestimate the value of the extinction by approximately 15% .    our extinction estimate could also be affected by clustering if one of the fields we have chosen to study is more or less strongly clustered compared to the other .",
    "the integral of the two point angular correlation function gives an estimate of the extra variance introduced by clustering in the number counts . in the magnitude range",
    "studied here , the two point angular correlation function can be approximated by @xmath47 ( @xcite ) . integrating over the wfc2 area studied , we find that the angular clustering on the sky adds a small contribution to the variance in the counts at the magnitude range studied .",
    "if we include this additional variance contribution into our maximum likelihood method and also take into account the previous @xmath1115% correction factor , we obtain a revised extinction value of @xmath48 , where the estimated error includes the contribution of our correction factor as well as the contribution resulting from our _ clustering - modified _ maximum likelihood method .",
    "spectroscopy of the grb optical afterglow was attempted using the keck ii telescope by tonry et al .",
    "although they could not obtain a spectrum with sufficient signal - to - noise to discern the nature of the optical counterpart , they obtained spectra of several other nearby objects that fell within the long slit they used ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "figure available at :    http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/fjc/figures/cl98a/cl98a.fig2.eps    we retrieved the spectroscopic data from the hawaii public ftp directory and reduced them .",
    "observations had been taken with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) in six exposures on march 31.25 ut ( 500 s and 1000 s ) , april 1.25 ut ( 1000 s and 1000 s ) and april 2.25 ut ( 1000 s and 1000 s ) . the instrument configuration used was the 300 lines / mm grating , blazing at 5000  , giving a dispersion of @xmath112.5  / pixel and an approximate wavelength coverage 4300 - 9500  .",
    "the slit was 1.0  wide and 2.9 long .",
    "it was centered at the star 2.9  east of the optical counterpart ( s1 ) and moved 10  eastward in two of the exposures .",
    "the position angle was 86.4 degrees .",
    "the spectroscopic images were processed using standard iraf routines .",
    "we combined the observations into one image , shifting the offset images and rejecting cosmic rays .",
    "the resulting optimally - extracted spectra were found to be insensitive to the type of shift applied : fractional or integer pixel shifts .",
    "six objects fell , totally or partially , within the slit and produced dispersed spectra in the 2-dimensional images .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows where the slit was placed in the sky and the objects for which spectra were obtained .",
    "we did not include in the final combined image the observations taken on march 31.25 ut , due to their poorer quality .",
    "the total exposure used was then 4000 s.    we extracted the spectra with our own implementation of horne s optimal extraction algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectra were wavelength - calibrated with he - ne arcs and flux calibrated with the spectrophotometric standard hiltner 600 .",
    "we obtained spectrophotometric colors convolving the flux calibrated spectra with the wfpc2 filter responses . comparing these to the photometric colors measured in the wfpc2 hst image we found our relative flux calibration errors to be lower than 5% ( see table  [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "the flux ratios of the balmer emission lines of galaxies can be used to characterize the optical extinction",
    ". the @xmath49 and @xmath50 ratios of emission - line galaxies depend on the conditions within that galaxy . theoretically , for typical galaxy conditions",
    ", these values are 2.88 and 0.46 respectively ( @xcite ) . the measured values , however , will differ due to the intrinsic extinction within the galaxy at redshift @xmath51 and to the local extinction in our own galaxy . once the balmer line flux ratios are measured , and assuming a typical extinction law , one can compute both the intrinsic and the local extinction values .    in the keck ii spectroscopic observations , the two galaxies that happened to lie within the slit exhibited emission lines .",
    "however , only the spectrum of the galaxy  g2 , at redshift @xmath52 , had a large enough signal - to - noise ratio to allow reliable measurements of the balmer emission line fluxes ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we measure the following balmer line flux ratios : @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where the errors are mainly due to the uncertaintanty in estimating the continuum . assuming a standard value for these ratios of 2.88 and 0.465 ( @xcite ) and a typical extinction law for diffuse interstellar medium , @xmath55 ( @xcite )",
    ", we can obtain the values for the extinction intrinsic to the galaxy and within our own galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the values allowed with our measured ratios and assumptions .",
    "our best values are : @xmath56 and @xmath57 . however , due to the uncertainties in the ratios and the almost parallel constraints that the ratios place in the @xmath58 vs. @xmath59 plane , a wide range of values are allowed ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "another method that can be used to estimate the extinction in this field is to compare the spectral energy distributions and spectral types of stars observed spectroscopically .",
    "if the spectral type can be reliably determined without color or spectral continuum information , then one can infer the extinction by finding the best fit of the extinction - corrected spectrum ( either in color or continuum spectral distribution ) to library spectra of the same spectral type , with the extinction correction as a fitting parameter .    as mentioned before",
    ", three stars were observed spectroscopically ( two accidentally ) with the keck ii telescope by tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios achieved in the 6000 - 7000  spectral region were 3.7 , 11.5 and 1.3 for stars s1 , s2 and s3 , respectively .",
    "these stars were also observed within the wfpc2 hst pointings of the grb970228 field .",
    "table  [ tbl1 ] summarizes the magnitudes and colors measured for these stars .",
    "the apparent magnitudes indicate that these stars are most likely to be dwarfs .",
    "if they were giants , their apparent magnitudes would imply that their distances are larger than 100 kpc in order to be consistent with absolute magnitudes of giant stars of the same spectral type .",

    "we compare them with the stellar spectral atlases of jacoby et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and silva & cornell ( 1992 ) .",
    "given the wavelength coverage and the low signal - to - noise ratio of the stellar spectra , there are only a few features that can be used to classify these stars",

    "the k - star classifications are mainly based on the mg @xmath615174 and na @xmath615893 @xmath62 indexes ( @xcite ) , and on the presence or absence of tio , vo and cah bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have also attempted a more automatic classification , based only on line information .",

    "taking into consideration our visual classification , the measured spectral indexes and the automatic classification allowed types , we estimate the value of the extinction for each star by reddening the template spectra to fit the spectral distribution of our observed stars . in order to avoid possible problems with sky subtraction ,",

    "this conversion factor is almost the same as that obtained by heiles ( 1976 ) and somewhat lower than that of knapp & kerr ( 1974 ) . according to bohlin et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , although they do not quote a formal error , their conversion factor should be accurate to within a factor of 1.5 for the total ( hi+h@xmath77 ) hydrogen column density . comparing their total and neutral hydrogen plots against color excess",

    "the difference between these two values is due to a zero point difference in the relation .",
    "however , other methods of determining the color excess give slightly different values .",
    "for example , burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , using a combined hi column density / galaxy number counts method , get a value of @xmath80 , using the heiles ( 1975 ) and heiles & cleary ( 1979 ) hi measurements and the smoothed shane & wirtanen ( 1967 ) galaxy counts . if instead of using the hydrogen column density value used by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , we use the stark ( 1992 ) and dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) value , adopting the conversion factor employed by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , and the value they give for the smoothed galaxy counts from shane & wirtanen ( 1967 ) we obtain @xmath81 .",
    "the error in the neutral hydrogen column density measurement is negligible compared to the error in its relation to reddening , and therefore should not add significant uncertainty to the color excess value derived .",
    "however , the resolution of the hi maps is poor , around 1 or 2 degrees .",
    "the @xcite 21 cm hi map of the grb970228 field is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "as can be seen , the grb970228 is in a region showing a relatively steep hi gradient on angular scales of a few degrees and it is quite conceivable that there are significant deviations on small angular scales from the value assumed .",
    "figure available at :    http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/fjc/figures/cl98a/cl98a.fig6.eps    taking into account these considerations , we conservatively adopt a value of @xmath82 . assuming an extinction law typical of the diffuse interstellar medium , @xmath83 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , this gives an extinction value of @xmath84 .",
    "the optical extinction is also known to correlate with infrared emission at long wavelengths ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , this correlation shows substantial scatter because the infrared emission is dependent on the radiation field and the temperature of the dust grains ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this relation should be valid to within approximately @xmath89 .",
    "thus we obtain a value for the extinction of @xmath90 . however , the grb970228 field is located near the galactic anticenter and towards that direction the intensity of the radiation field declines and therefore the conversion factor is likely to be higher than the value adopted , and consequently , the extinction value underestimated .    recently , schlegel et al .",

    "we have used several methods in order to determine the galactic extinction towards the field of grb970228 .",
    "first , we have measured galaxy number counts in the hst wfpc2 images and compared them to those in the hdf , a field of known optical extinction . in order to reduce the systematic errors , we have reanalyzed the hdf using the same techniques that we utilized for the grb field .",
    "our object catalog for the hdf is very similar to that of the hdf team , reinforcing the view that our selection method and magnitude determinations are appropriate .",
    "we have also checked all selected objects in the magnitude ranges studied to make sure that the different depths of the images was not influencing the number counts , as could be the case , for example , with the deblending algorithm .",
    "for instance , in the wf2 ccd image of the grb970228 field there is a face on spiral that was over deblended .",
    "diffraction spikes also can produce automatic selection of spurious objects .",
    "we corrected these manually .",
    "this manual rejection hardly affected our extinction estimate .",
    "another possible source of error comes from star / galaxy separation . again , because grb field and the hdf have different exposures , for the same magnitude ranges , objects in the hdf are detected at a higher signal - to - noise ratio and can therefore be better classified .",
    "moreover , the grb field is at a much lower galactic latitude , increasing the surface number density of stars .",
    "although the number of stars detected and rejected is low , and therefore statistics on them are poor , the number of stars detected is compatible with the expectations of the bahcall & soneira 1984 galactic model for this particular galactic latitude . as a worst case scenario",
    ", we also estimated the extinction with our maximum likelihood method , assuming that all objects are galaxies .",
    "in this extreme case , the value of the extinction , @xmath35 , that we obtain is approximately 0.1 magnitudes lower than our best estimate .",
    "another possible concern is the effect that extinction itself and the different exposure times can have on the method .",
    "the grb field shows considerably more extinction than the hdf and was exposed for a much shorter time .",
    "incompleteness near the limiting magnitude of the grb field or low surface brightness objects being asigned fainter magnitudes or being missed altogether could make us overestimate the extinction .",
    "we believe that we have taken into account these effects with the correction factor we derived from our simulations ( see section  2 ) .    in our maximum likelihood analysis",
    "we have combined the f606w and f814w images , assuming an extinction law .",
    "if we analyze both of the images separately , we obtain consistent results when converting the extinction in the wfpc2 filter to @xmath35 , although the errors are larger .",
    "the f814w image gives a somewhat higher estimate for @xmath35 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the combined extinction measured , denoted by the horizontal separation between the solid and dashed lines , seems insufficient to explain the observed number counts .",
    "the combined extinction value given by the maximum likelihood method is closer to the extinction given by the f606w image than to the one given by the f814w image .",
    "the f606w observations , having approximately double the exposure time , go deeper and therefore more objects are detected in the observations taken in this filter .",
    "the f606w counts therefore have slightly more weight in the combined maximum likelihood method .",
    "gonzlez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are also conducting an investigation of the galactic extinction towards this same field .",
    "one of their estimates comes from a comparison of the cumulative number counts in the grb field and the hdf in the f606w filter .",
    "in essence , their method is very similar to our combined maximum likelihood method .",
    "it is therefore reassuring that we obtain consistent values , within the errors ( fruchter , private communication ) .",
    "we have also measured the optical extinction by analyzing the spectra of three nearby stars .",
    "star s1 is the closest object to grb970228 , only 2.9  away , and the other two are only 16.8  ( s2 ) and 42.7  ( s3 ) away .",
    "these stars should then give the best estimate of the extinction if it varies on small angular scales .",
    "using stellar spectra has another advantage .",
    "a wide wavelength range is sampled and the extinction signature can , in principle , be better determined .",
    "therefore we believe this method should provide the best estimate of the optical extinction towards grb970228",
    ". however , the stellar spectra available are of poor signal - to - noise and do not cover blue wavelength regions that are important for determining spectral types ( bluewards of @xmath60 ) and where the effects of extinction are stronger .",
    "the main contribution in our error budget is then the allowed range of spectral types . in comparison ,",
    "the error due to the spectrophotometric calibration is considerably smaller .",
    "table  [ tbl1 ] shows the consistency between the photometric and spectrophotometric derived colors .",
    "this method , potentially superior to the others , is thus somewhat hampered by the errors involved .",
    "the balmer lines ratios should also provide a powerful constraint on the optical extinction .",
    "however , the two galaxy spectra taken by chance are of low signal - to - noise , as the slit happened to fall far off the galaxy centers . for galaxy g2",
    "we are able to measure the @xmath92 and @xmath93 ratios .",
    "the value obtained from the former ratio is degenerate in the internal galaxy extinction and the extinction due to our own galaxy ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) and the error in the second ratio does not allow us to break this degeneracy .",
    "so , although we obtain a best - fit value that is consistent with our best extinction estimate , this value is unconstrained and therefore not used .",
    "the other methods used do not measure the extinction in the optical and rely on correlations between various observed quantities and the optical extinction to get an estimate .",
    "this necessary extrapolation renders these techniques more uncertain .",
    "the correlations between hydrogen column density and color excess ( or extinction ) , and between the infrared 100 micron emission and color excess are known to have large intrinsic scatters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the infrared emission has the additional disadvantage that , near the galactic plane , it depends on the galactic longitude , because the contribution of the stellar radiation field to the dust emission declines with distance from the galactic center ( @xcite ) .",
    "grb970228 is located near the galactic anticenter at @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and it is conceivable that the relation we have used to obtain the optical extinction underestimates it . on the other hand ,",
    "the value obtained by sdf98 is very similar and is based on a different calibration that does not depend on this correlation , so the effect of galactic longitude is unclear .",
    "another concern about these methods is the spatial resolution .",
    "the resolution of the hydrogen column density maps that we have used is of the order of a degree , while the resolution of the iras 100 micron maps that we have used is approximately 5 arcminutes .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows both maps .",
    "the two maps correlate well on large angular scales . however , the resolution of the hydrogen column density map is clearly insufficient for a good determination of the extinction towards grb970228 because there is a strong gradient in this region .",
    "the iras 100 micron image , with its higher resolution , demonstrates this point .",
    "structures of a few arcminutes in size that are visible in the 100 @xmath86 map are smeared out in the hi image .",
    "it is important to note that the infrared emission is very knotty in the grb region that coincides with the outskirts of a snr centered @xmath96 to the east ( left ) outside of our image in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "it is unclear , whether material from this snr can contribute to the extinction in the grb field , although from the 100 @xmath86 image this seem unlikely",
    ". the iras 100 micron image does not provide enough resolution for a definitive conclusion .",
    "table  [ tbl2 ] summarizes our measurements .",
    "we have computed the optical extinction using three different methods .",
    "we have also used correlations with neutral hydrogen and dust emission for additional estimates .",
    "the measured x - ray spectrum of the grb afterglow provides another measurement of the extinction as well .",
    "unfortunately , given the faintness of the grb x - ray afterglow when observed by bepposax this constraint is very weak and completely superseded by our measurements .",
    "we compute our best value for the optical extinction with the weighted average of the values obtained by the different methods .",
    "we apply two weights to average our measurements .",
    "one is inversely proportional to the relative error and the other is based on our subjective evaluation of the method reliability .",
    "we arbitrarily assign a three times larger weight to methods based on optical data than those based on other wavelengths .",
    "these weights are tabulated in table  [ tbl2 ] third and fourth column respectively .",
    "it is somewhat puzzling that not all the methods used give estimates of the extinction that are consistent with each other .",
    "the two methods based on spectroscopic observations give higher values .",
    "this effect could be due to a wrong spectrophotometric calibration .",
    "however , the agreement between photometric and spectrophotometric colors ( table  [ tbl1 ] ) indicates that this is not the case .",
    "a spectral type misclassification could also yield to an overestimation of the extinction using stellar spectra .",
    "we believe that we have been very cautious assigning spectral types ( see section 3.2 ) , which results in the large errors quoted .",
    "for example , if the value of the extinction is @xmath97 , star s2 had to be an m star in order to be compatible with the observed colors ( or overall spectral slope ) .",
    "the lack of strong molecular features in the spectrum rules out this possibility . to illustrate the scope of the disagreement we plot in figure  [ fig5b ] the observed spectrum of star s2 along with a stellar library spectra of a k4v star , that is reddened with an @xmath55 extinction law of @xmath32 , 0.5 , 1.0 1.5 and 2.0 .",
    "a value of the extinction around @xmath97 would imply a reddened k4v star that has a markedly different spectral slope than that of star s2 .",
    "if the extinction value measured using the stellar spectra is at least @xmath98 ( the best value obtained with the balmer emission line ratios agrees with such a figure ) , why do the other methods give a significant lower value ?",
    "we believe that a plausible explanation could be variations in the extinction on angular scales @xmath99 arcminute .",
    "the iras 100 @xmath86 map provides evidence of strong variations of the dust emission on scales of a few arcminutes ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that the difference between extinction estimates derived from hydrogen and infrared dust emissions and the extinction estimate derived from the spectra of the nearby stars is due to variations on arcminute scales .",
    "however , in order to explain the difference between the extinction estimates obtained from galaxy number counts and the spectra of nearby stars , those variations would have to be on scales @xmath99 arcminutes .",
    "this would have to be so because the wfpc2 images cover scales of the order of one arcminutes , while stars s1 and s2 , which have the most weight in the estimation using stellar spectra , are only 2.9  and 16.8  arcseconds away from grb970228 .",
    "some support for the hypothesis of variations in the extinction on small angular scales comes from the fact that the pc1 ccd has fewer objects than expected from extrapolation of the wf ccds counts ; however , this deficit is not statistically significant .",
    "gonzlez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also estimate the extinction in this field .",
    "they compare cumulative galaxy number counts and galaxy colors in the grb970228 field to those in several other hst wfpc2 images to obtain a value of the extinction .",
    "they obtain values consistent with the sfd98 estimate .    summarizing ,",
    "our best estimate for the optimal extinction is @xmath0 .",
    "such a value considerably modifies the broad - band spectral shape of the grb970228 afterglow ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , an observed broad band @xmath100 color of 2.0 would deredden to an unabsorbed @xmath101 and a @xmath102 magnitude of 22.0 would turn into @xmath103 . if we were to drop the determinations of the extinction from the stellar spectra , we would obtain @xmath104 , but we feel that there is no a priori reason why these should be discarded .",
    "we emphasize that the stars lie close to and bracket the position of the grb970228 afterglow .",
    "we have measured the extinction towards the field of grb970228 . in making this determination ,",
    "we have used the relative number counts between the wfpc2 images of the hdf and grb970228 fields , the spectra of three nearby stars and the balmer line ratios of a nearby galaxy .",
    "the first method produces the tightest constraint due to the relative good statistics .",
    "the second method constitutes the best way of determining the extinction because the widest spectral range is covered and the stars lie near the direction of grb970228 .",
    "however , due to poor signal - to - noise the constraints are poor .",
    "the third method gives an unconstrained value of the extinction , although it is convenient to remark that its best value coincides with our final result within the errors .",
    "variance among the results of these methods may indicate that the gas and dust in this direction are `` mottled '' or clumped on small angular scales .",
    "we have used other indirect methods based on the hydrogen column density and the dust 100@xmath86 emission .",
    "the infrared emission gives a lower estimate for the extinction than the previous methods . combining the above techniques , weighting the optical methods more than the other indirect ones , we obtain a best value of @xmath0 .",
    "the measured @xmath35 implies that the grb970228 afterglow is intrinsically brighter and bluer than the observed magnitudes and color .",
    "for example , in the @xmath105 filter the intrinsic magnitudes is 1.2 brighter and the @xmath100 color is 0.52 magnitudes bluer than observed .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge carlo graziani , daniel reichart and jean quashnock , for their help , especially with regard to statistical methodology .",
    "we have also benefited from useful discussions with mark metzger , cole miller , dave cole and andrew fruchter .",
    "we thank andrew fruchter in particular for pointing out to us the effect on galaxy number counts of surface brightness dimming due to extinction .",
    "we thank john tonry , esther hu , len cowie and richard mcmahon for making publicly available their spectra of the objects in the grb97028 field .",
