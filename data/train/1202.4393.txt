    "<S> the national interest group is partitioned into three subgroups : two that are politically liberal and conservative , and a third that is interested in a variety of topics , including business , sports and arts .        </S>",

    "<S> strongly linked groups that rapidly share information may react together and with shared views @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wider social propagation and influence of information is then limited by the strength of `` weak ties '' between these groups  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an understanding of society not only depends on characterizing the behavior of individuals and their immediate links , but also on identifying emergent social collectives . </S>",
    "<S> for example , individuals might group by political orientation , economic class , race , family , profession , age , religion or geography , or by domain of interest such as business , sports , arts and politics .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the universal properties of complex systems is substructure @xcite , the characteristics of which are essential to a particular system s distinct qualities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of substructure is apparent in an analysis of the information flows in the human brain , where sensory , motor and other functional separations of information are key to the overall information processing . </S>",

    "<S> individuals might change their associations by moving , and groups might change their location by migrating . as a way of understanding the changing nature of human social organization , we might calibrate it to the growing frequency of longer range interactions , and the extent to which communication is one - to - one ( peer - to - peer ) or one - to - many , the latter being a characteristic of mass media . from messengers , to letters , telegrams , telephone , </S>",
    "<S> e - mail and e - messaging , peer - to - peer communications became easier and more frequent . from public presentations , to printing presses , radio , cinema , and television , mass media expanded the scope of recipients and restricted the sources of communication . </S>",

    "<S> social associations can be based upon any criteria . </S>",
    "<S> released from the constraints of geography , people may choose to associate with others based upon what they consider most important and their self - identity . instead of a local or national identity </S>",

    "<S> a person focused on music could choose only to communicate with others who are focused on music . </S>",
    "<S> religiously focused individuals may communicate solely with others with shared religious views . </S>",
    "<S> individuals who primarily value family ties may focus on those relationships . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the choices of association reinforce the form of identity that led to those associations .    individual choices of who to interact with result in the overall communication structure of society . </S>",
    "<S> the communication structure is then responsible for the collective behaviors that arise when news about events , and opinion formation , result in social movements and collective decision making @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> understanding this structure and dynamics can be fundamental to our ability to characterize society . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of detailed information about social media provides a new way to advance our understanding of the dynamics of individual choices of association and social organization . </S>",
    "<S> our objective is to advance this understanding by starting to characterize the spontaneous development of collective structures in social media . </S>",
    "<S> we focus specifically on those structures associated with news information sharing , which are the most directly relevant to societal response to news events .    </S>",
    "<S> hundreds of millions of people around the world use social media and micro - blogging platforms as a real - time information source  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we identify news - sharing communities in the micro - blogging platform twitter . </S>",
    "<S> twitter users post very short ( at most 140-character ) posts called tweets . </S>",
    "<S> more than a hundred million tweets are posted every day  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these tweets are typically about what users do , think , or experience and want to share with other people  @xcite . sharing urls and reported news constitutes a significant fraction of user activities in twitter  @xcite . the brevity of tweets and their rapid distribution facilitates sharing and receiving the news as events unfold @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> twitter enables individuals general access to tweets , but also allows people to construct social connections that form primary channels of communication . </S>",
    "<S> twitter users identify other users to `` follow '' in order to be notified of their tweets . </S>",
    "<S> each user can be thought of as a node in a network , and the relationships as links between them .    </S>",
    "<S> a  follow relation \" in twitter may reflect various kinds of relationships . </S>",
    "<S> preexisting friends may follow each other , but there are also ways to discover others to follow within the twitter system . </S>",
    "<S> since users share what is important to them , the way the twitter society organizes itself both reflects and influences social communication . </S>",
    "<S> research has confirmed that twitter users with similar interests tend to connect to each other  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analyses suggest that twitter serves more for information sharing than for casual conversation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is also research that has associated specific twitter users or user categories ( celebrities , media , organizations , and blog writers ) with specific intentions such as information providing , information seeking and friendship / conversation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , celebrities show an elevated interest in sport - related news , media accounts are more interested in us - related news , and organizations show more interest in science , technology and world news  @xcite .    the ability to track the social relationships and </S>",
    "<S> the posted content in social media enables studies of the communities that are forming and their emerging collective behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> here we study the overall structure of certain communities that have spontaneously formed in twitter and we characterize their social , political , and geographic natures . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of a network has an important effect on dynamics of the network  @xcite and its response to external perturbations @xcite , as can be seen in epidemics @xcite and information spread in social networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our focus is on the characteristics of the spontaneous social groups that are formed and the insights that this gives about user self - identification , social priorities and collective social response .    </S>",
    "<S> we identify social groups formed out of users who tweet or retweet new york times online articles . </S>",
    "<S> the new york times is a major traditional news media outlet that is read by millions of people all over the world . </S>",
    "<S> we use three dimensions to characterize users : topics of interest , geographical locations , and self - description . </S>",
    "<S> the topics of interest are based on the articles that the users share . </S>",
    "<S> the topic category is identifiable in the article s url , i.e. _ </S>",
    "<S> www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/science/ ... </S>",
    "<S> _ is a science related article . </S>",
    "<S> geographical location is identified by analyzing the location field of user profiles in twitter . </S>",
    "<S> self - description is based on analyzing the terms the users use to describe themselves in their twitter profile `` bio '' field . </S>",
    "<S> the multiple dimensions of identity provide insights into the nature of the groups that have spontaneously formed in the twitter network . despite its new york focus , </S>",
    "<S> the global reach of the new york times enables us to consider the implications of the results for developing national and global communities . </S>",
    "<S> details of the analysis are given in the appendices .    </S>",
    "<S> we collected tweets containing a new york times article link over a fifteen day period , september 14 - 29 , 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> this resulted in a collection of 521,733 tweets posted by 223,950 unique users . </S>",
    "<S> we considered only users who posted at least three urls from the same category . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtained the `` following '' relationships ( who follows whom ) among these users , and constructed a graph of the users and their follow relations . </S>",
    "<S> the largest connected component of the graph contains 8,106 nodes and 163,850 links . </S>",
    "<S> each user was labeled with the topic that s / he posted the most , with ties broken in favor of less popular topics . </S>",
    "<S> details are provided in appendix a.    the news sharer network we obtained is shown in figure  [ fig : network ] . </S>",
    "<S> the layout , shown at the top , is completely determined by the connections between users . users who are connected to each other by a follow relationship are pulled together by virtual springs and those who are not are pushed apart  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the visual layout then naturally identifies those nodes that belong to highly connected groups . </S>",
    "<S> no information about the identity or interests of the users is used to create the layout . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering of the network manifests a strong social separation that can also be shown using a clustering algorithm that identifies the left and right parts of the network and further divides each to upper and lower clusters . </S>",
    "<S> details of the layout generation and cluster generation are provided in appendix b.        in the main image in figure  [ fig : network ] , the user nodes are colored according to the article topics that users most often share in tweets . </S>",
    "<S> topic colors are not randomly scattered . in some but not all cases </S>",
    "<S> the same colored users are clustered together . </S>",
    "<S> the cases where they do are consistent with the idea that users with the same interests tend to follow each other . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , users who are interested in the topic  world \" are clustered in the upper - left part of the network , and users who are interested in the topic  us \" are clustered in the upper - right part .    </S>",
    "<S> the most prevalent topics of interest for the primary clusters are shown in figure  [ fig : clustering ] . </S>",
    "<S> the division of left ( a ) and right ( b ) clusters most prominently separates those who are interested in world news ( cluster a ) from those interested in us - based news ( cluster b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further divide cluster a into upper and lower sub - clusters and find that the dominant topic in upper a is world news whereas lower a has a more diverse set of topics with business , us , arts , fashion , and sports being well represented in this sub - cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the clusters are quite distinct and begin to reveal their nature . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is not the case that each news topic has its own cluster . </S>",
    "<S> instead , some topics differentiate the clusters , while others are grouped together . </S>",
    "<S> the clear separation between us and world news suggests that geography might be the key to the structure of the social network ( a geographical location analysis is given in appendix c ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sense in which geography plays a role is through the scope of interest : local , national and global .            </S>",
    "<S> identifying the most distinctive aspects of each cluster in all three dimensions ( topic , location , and biography ) provides a more complete picture as shown in figure  [ fig : comp_all ] ( details are given in appendix d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> * upper a is formed of users interested in international topics , who live in various cities around the world , including new york and washington dc , are focused on human rights and politics , and may themselves be journalists . </S>",
    "<S> we might call them the cosmopolitan group . the small separate cluster in the upper left </S>",
    "<S> consists of users giving their location as bahrain , which appear due to the arab spring events during the period of time we studied . * lower </S>",
    "<S> a is a new york oriented group , many of whom say they are located in new york , interested in a diverse set of topics including world , us , business , arts , fashion and sports . </S>",
    "<S> we can call them the local or  new york scene . \" </S>",
    "<S> * upper b is interested primarily in us politics , is us based , with focal locations in new york and washington dc , and is predominantly liberal and progressive . * lower b , like lower a </S>",
    "<S> , has a diverse set of topics with a stronger focus on business , but also interested in world news , sports , fashion and the arts . </S>",
    "<S> it is geographically spread across the us and has an apparently conservative bent . </S>",
    "<S> however , we found that this orientation is specific to one subgroup of lower b. figure  [ fig : network ] shows that the lower b group itself separates into a top right closely coupled cluster and other less strongly clumped ones . </S>",
    "<S> the top right group is primarily interested in us politics and self - identifies as conservative , and the rest of lower b has a broad array of interests and is not politically distinct .    given the separation of the lower b group into the conservative cluster and the rest , we have five primary clusters that can be readily identified . </S>",
    "<S> a simple characterization of these groups is that three are identified with new york , us and global interests . </S>",
    "<S> the other two clusters are also us based but are specifically liberal and conservative in their political orientation .    aside from the main clusters , there are small topically focused clusters of users particularly in the lower part of figure 1 , that can be seen to be primarily interested in arts or sports .    </S>",
    "<S> the results reveal intriguing insights about how the network is organized . </S>",
    "<S> traditional geographic groups would be associated with individual cities or countries . </S>",
    "<S> freedom from geography does not eliminate entirely geographical association but results in subject driven communities that are interested in local ( ny ) , national ( us ) and global ( cosmopolitan ) issues . </S>",
    "<S> the national group subdivides into liberal and conservative political groups and a diverse but mostly business oriented group with sports , arts and other splinters . a person who is cosmopolitan associates with others who are cosmopolitan , and a us liberal / conservative associates with others who are us liberal / conservative , creating separated social groups with those identities . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while local associations are sometimes primary , individuals may choose to associate with national or cosmopolitan groups . </S>",
    "<S> a significant fraction of the population have become so strongly identified with ideological camps that those identities drive their social associations . for those who are concerned about the polarization of society into liberal and conservative camps @xcite , the results have both positive and negative connotations . </S>",
    "<S> the groups that stratify into local , national and cosmopolitan are not politically polarized , but there are specific subgroups that are polarized into opposing camps .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is limited to new york times news sharing and a specific window of time . </S>",
    "<S> individual twitter users may represent individuals or institutions . </S>",
    "<S> also , the existence of specific keyword dominances is a prevalence measure and does not imply that all members or even a majority of the members of a group have that property . nevertheless , our results manifest the strong clustering of social systems that results in specific group identity .    recent research has focused on user types and network topologies in social media  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies have considered the distance distribution of cell phone social networks @xcite and of a blog community @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter manifests both short range and long range connections , which our research suggests may be due to distinct sub - groups . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also has implications for understanding the ability of individuals in social networks to intentionally transmit messages globally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be readily understood if groups that are national and cosmopolitan in orientation exist and are even weakly known by individuals of local groups . </S>",
    "<S> the widespread geography of members of cosmopolitan groups enable them to broadly transmit messages </S>",
    "<S> .    in summary , social media , and in particular twitter , have created new opportunities for communication that are closely connected to daily lives of people , their demographics , and social and political interests . </S>",
    "<S> the changing communication channels also promise significant changes in the dynamics of social response to events . </S>",
    "<S> social media contribute to the ability of groups to engage in activities , even including revolutions , that are underway around the world @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of data about these social networks and communications also provides new opportunities for understanding how social systems form and function . </S>",
    "<S> we used a combination of text and network analysis to study how people share information , and which patterns emerge from the social interactions and interests . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reveals the natural clustering of society . </S>",
    "<S> we find individuals separate into groups primarily by interest in local , national or global ( cosmopolitan ) issues . </S>",
    "<S> the national group subdivides into liberal , conservative and a diverse but mostly business oriented group with sports , arts and other splinters .    </S>",
