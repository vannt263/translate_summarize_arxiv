    "it is now well - known that it is possible to associate with any germ of isolated hypersurface singularity a canonical frobenius - saito structure ( also called a flat structure by k.  saito ) on the ( germ of the ) base space of its miniversal unfolding .",
    "the theory of primitive forms @xcite allows such a construction , together with hodge theory of the brieskorn lattice , as developed by m.  saito @xcite ( see also @xcite for a presentation of the theory ) .",
    "such a construction is local , but also canonical .    in @xcite ,",
    "the second author has indicated how to extend such a construction to polynomials on @xmath2 which are convenient and nondegenerate with respect to their newton polyhedron , a notion defined by a.g .",
    "kouchnirenko in @xcite .",
    "the reason for extending the previous work of k.  saito and m.  saito is that , in some aspect of mirror symmetry theory , the landau - ginzburg potential often takes the form of the universal unfolding of a function on a smooth complex affine variety and is not necessarily reducible to the unfolding of a germ of complex isolated singularity .",
    "a motivation to extend furthermore the construction to convenient and nondegenerate laurent polynomials , which is the main result of this article , comes from the computation of s.  barannikov @xcite for the particular case of the laurent polynomial @xmath3 : he associates to such a laurent polynomial a frobenius structure on the germ @xmath4 , which is shown to be equivalent to that coming from the quantum cohomology of @xmath5 ( defined in @xcite ) .",
    "one finds in @xcite other such polynomials . in the second part @xcite of this article , we will extend the computation of s.  barannikov to the case of the linear form @xmath6 restricted to the torus @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is any sequence of positive integers such that @xmath9 ; in such a case , the canonical frobenius structure is completely determined by its initial data , that we compute explicitly .    in this article",
    ", we give a detailed presentation of the construction of the frobenius structure attached to a regular tame function on an affine manifold ( when a primitive homogeneous form exists , see below ) .",
    "we first give the main properties of the gauss - manin system and the brieskorn lattice of any unfolding of such a function .",
    "essentially , we show that all expected results ( if we refer to the local situation ) hold : holonomicity , regularity , duality ... such results were only sketched in @xcite . in appendix  [ app : a ] , we recall with some details basic results written by b.  abdel - gadir in @xcite , as these papers are hardly available .    once these basic results are obtained , the main tools that one has to develop in order to mimic k.+m .",
    "saito s construction of the frobenius structure are :    * the hodge theory for the brieskorn lattice of the tame function @xmath0 on a smooth complex affine variety , * the existence of a primitive and homogeneous section of the brieskorn lattice .",
    "the first one was achieved in @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ app : b ] , we recall the analogue , in the affine situation , of the method of m.  saito to obtain a solution of birkhoff s problem for the brieskorn lattice . this slightly simplifies the approach in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we make the link with the construction of good bases given in @xcite .",
    "we are then mainly interested in finding a primitive homogeneous section corresponding to the minimal exponent .",
    "natural candidates are volume forms . in the singularity case , the minimal exponent has multiplicity one @xcite , so such a primitive homogeneous section is essentially unique , if it exists .",
    "in fact , any volume form gives rise to such a primitive homogeneous section .",
    "we show that a similar result holds for convenient nondegenerate laurent polynomials on @xmath10 .",
    "it was asserted in @xcite that the same result holds for convenient nondegenerate polynomials on @xmath2 .",
    "however , let us emphasize that a supplementary assumption is understated there : _ the linear forms defining the newton boundary have nonnegative coefficients_. without this assumption , the volume form may not be homogeneous , the minimal exponent may not have multiplicity one , and we can not assert the existence of any primitive homogeneous section .    a basic tool in the convenient nondegenerate case , which goes back to @xcite , consists in the identification between the hodge exponents at infinity ( the hodge spectrum ) and the newton exponents .",
    "a simple proof of this result is given in  .15em [ sec : laurent ] .",
    "it also applies to the case of convenient nondegenerate polynomials on @xmath2 which was treated in @xcite .",
