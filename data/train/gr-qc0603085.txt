    "physically speaking , the goal of this paper is to study the exotic statistics of loop - like defects in a 4-dimensional topological field theory called @xmath0 theory .",
    "we call these entities ` closed strings ' for short , though they behave differently from the closed strings familiar in string theory : the relevant lagrangian is different . in fact",
    ", we postpone the study of their dynamics to another paper @xcite .",
    "the considerations of this paper are purely topological , and accessible  we hope  to mathematicians with only a passing interest in physics .    mathematically speaking ,",
    "the point of this paper is to study some representations of a higher - dimensional analogue of the braid group : the ` loop braid group ' .",
    "just as the braid group describes the topology of points moving in the plane , the loop braid group describes the topology of circles moving in @xmath2 . in the body of this paper , we describe this group and certain representations of it coming from the moduli space of flat bundles on @xmath2 with these circles removed .",
    "but since everything we do has a more familiar analogue one dimension down , let us start by recalling that .",
    "the behavior of a collection of identical particles when they are exchanged goes by the name of ` statistics ' .",
    "traditionally , statistics was described using representations of the symmetric group .",
    "however , it is well known that in 3d spacetime , ` exotic ' statistics are possible , in which the process of exchanging identical particles is described by a representation of the braid group . for example , exchanging two ` abelian anyons ' multiplies their wavefunction by a phase , which need not be @xmath3 as it is for bosons , nor @xmath4 as for fermions .",
    "this possibility has been investigated in experiments on the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "now researchers have begun the search for ` nonabelian anyons ' , whose statistics are described by more complicated representations of the braid group @xcite .",
    "plans are already afoot to use these in quantum computers @xcite .",
    "exotic statistics also arise naturally in the context of 3d quantum gravity . as we ` turn on gravity ' , letting newton s gravitational constant @xmath5 become nonzero , ordinary quantum field theory on 3d minkowski spacetime deforms into a theory where the poincar group goes over to a quantum group called the @xmath5-poincar group .",
    "moreover , if we begin with a field theory of bosons , their statistics become exotic as we turn on gravity . for a thorough treatment of these fascinating phenomena , see the papers by freidel and collaborators @xcite , the paper by krasnov @xcite , and the many references therein .",
    "in fact , the reason for exotic statistics in 3d quantum gravity is very simple . in 3d",
    "spacetime , einstein s equations say that spacetime is _ flat _ except in regions where matter is present .",
    "a point particle at rest bends the nearby space into a cone .",
    "this cone is flat everywhere except at its tip , where there is a deficit angle proportional to the particle s mass .",
    "if we parallel transport a vector around the particle , it gets rotated by this angle @xmath6 : @xmath7    more generally , if we have @xmath8 particles , space will be flat except for conical singularities at @xmath8 points . if we exchange these particles by moving them around the plane , they trace out a loop in the space of @xmath8-point subsets of the plane .",
    "their energy - momenta will change in a way that depends on this loop  but only on the _ homotopy class _ of this loop , because they are being parallel transported with respect to a flat connection .",
    "a homotopy class of such loops is just an @xmath8-strand braid : @xmath9 so , the group @xmath10 of @xmath8-strand braids acts on the hilbert space of states for @xmath8 identical particles .",
    "in fact , this result holds classically as well : we get an action of @xmath10 on the configuration space for @xmath8 identical particles .",
    "the above argument uses the fact that 3-dimensional gravity ( with vanishing cosmological constant ) can be described by @xmath0 theory with the lorentz group @xmath11 as gauge group . to understand this paper",
    ", the reader only needs to know one thing about @xmath0 theory : _ it involves a flat connection on space_. for completeness , however , we recall that @xmath0 theory in @xmath8-dimensional spacetime with gauge group @xmath1 involves two fields : a connection @xmath12 and a @xmath13-valued @xmath14-form @xmath15 . in the absence of matter ,",
    "the lagrangian is simply @xmath16 here @xmath5 plays the role of newton s constant in the case of 3d gravity , and @xmath17 is the curvature of @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting equations of motion : @xmath18 = 0,\\ ] ] imply that the connection @xmath12 is flat .    in 3d @xmath0 theory , point particles can be included by considering spacetimes with curves removed : we think of these as the particles worldlines . away from these worldlines",
    "the above equations still hold , while along the worldlines @xmath12 becomes singular .",
    "the holonomy around a loop circling a worldline gives an element of the group @xmath1 .",
    "a collection of @xmath8 particles in the plane thus gives rise to an @xmath8-tuple of elements of @xmath1 .",
    "for simplicity , consider the case @xmath19 . as we exchange two particles by rotating them around each other counterclockwise ,",
    "they trace out this braid : @xmath20 as we recall in section [ 3d ] , this operation acts as the following map on @xmath21 : @xmath22 applying this map twice does _ not _ give the identity , so we do not obtain an action of the symmetric group on @xmath21 , but only an action of the braid group .",
    "in other words , the particles have exotic statistics !    in the case of 3d gravity ,",
    "the singularity of the connection along a particle s worldline reflects the fact that the particle s mass creates a conical singularity in the metric .",
    "the holonomy around the worldline , an element of @xmath23 , describes the particle s _ energy - momentum_. this may seem odd , since we are used to thinking of energy - momentum as a vector in minkowski spacetime .",
    "however , in 3 dimensions minkowski spacetime is naturally isomorphic to the lie algebra @xmath24 , and we can reinterpret lie algebra elements as group elements via the map : @xmath25 so , we can encode the energy - momentum @xmath26 of a particle in the holonomy @xmath27 resulting from parallel transport around this particle s worldline .    thanks to the factor of @xmath5 here , the group @xmath11 effectively ` flattens out ' to @xmath24 in the @xmath28 limit .",
    "for example , multiplication in the group reduces to addition in the lie algebra plus small corrections : @xmath29   + \\cdots ) \\ ] ] this implies that in terms of @xmath24-valued energy - momenta , the braiding in equation ( [ braiding ] ) is given by @xmath30 + \\cdots \\ , , \\ , p_1 ) \\ ] ] so , the exotic statistics reduce to ordinary bosonic statistics in the limit where newton s constant goes to zero .",
    "they also reduce to bosonic statistics in the limit where the particles are at rest relative to each other , since then @xmath31 and @xmath32 become proportional and their commutator vanishes .",
    "the corrections to the usual law for addition of energy - momenta implicit in equation ( [ doubly_special ] ) are interesting in themselves . like the exotic statistics , these corrections become negligible in the limit @xmath28 . under the name of",
    "` doubly special relativity ' , modified laws for adding energy - momentum have already been studied by many authors .",
    "the paper by freidel , kowalski - glikman and smolin @xcite gives a good account of doubly special relativity in the context of 3d quantum gravity ; their paper also explains more of the history of this subject .",
    "1em      besides exotic statistics and corrections to the usual rule for adding energy - momenta , there is yet another surprising consequence of the switch from vector - valued to group - valued energy - momentum as we turn on gravity in 3d physics",
    ". the classification of elementary particles changes !    in ordinary quantum field theory on minkowski spacetime , the lorentz group acts on the space of possible energy - momenta , and the orbits of this action correspond to different types of spin - zero particles . when spacetime is 3-dimensional , the space of energy - momenta is @xmath24 , and the orbits look like this : @xmath33 if we write the energy - momentum as @xmath34 and let @xmath35 , we have six families of orbits , corresponding to six types of spin - zero particles :    1",
    ".   positive - energy tardyons of mass @xmath36 : @xmath37 , 2 .",
    "negative - energy tardyons of mass @xmath36 : @xmath38 , 3 .",
    "positive - energy luxons : @xmath39 , 4 .",
    "negative - energy luxons : @xmath40 , 5 .",
    "tachyons of mass @xmath41 for @xmath36 : @xmath42 , 6 .",
    "particles of vanishing energy - momentum : @xmath43 .    given any orbit @xmath44 ,",
    "the hilbert space for a single particle of type @xmath45 is just @xmath46 .",
    "the same philosophy applies when we turn on gravity , but now the space of energy - momenta is not the lie algebra @xmath24 but the lorentz group itself .",
    "this acts on itself by conjugation , and the orbits are conjugacy classes .",
    "types of spin - zero particles now correspond to conjugacy classes in the lorentz group . near the identity",
    "these conjugacy classes look just like orbits in the lie algebra , so the classification of particles reduces to the above one in the limit of small energy - momenta .",
    "however , there are important differences , which show up for large energy - momenta .",
    "most notably , under the map @xmath47 the lie algebra element @xmath48 is mapped to a rotation by the angle @xmath49 in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "so , the holonomy around a stationary particle of energy @xmath15 is a rotation by the angle @xmath49 .",
    "this rotation does not change when we add @xmath51 to the particle s energy . up to factors of order unity ,",
    "this quantity @xmath51 is just the _ planck energy_. if we call it the planck energy , then masses in 3d quantum gravity are defined only modulo the planck mass .",
    "this ` periodicity of mass ' affects the classification of tardyons  that is , the most familiar sort of particles , those with timelike energy - momentum . instead of positive - energy tardyons of arbitrary mass @xmath36 and negative - energy tardyons of arbitrary mass @xmath36",
    ", we just have tardyons of arbitrary mass @xmath52 .    more generally , for any lie group @xmath1",
    ", the various allowed types of spin - zero particles in 3d @xmath0 theory with gauge group @xmath1 correspond to conjugacy classes @xmath53 .",
    "any conjugacy class is closed under the operations @xmath54 and these operations satisfy equations making @xmath45 into an algebraic structure called a ` quandle ' @xcite , whose definition we recall in section [ quandle ] .",
    "the hilbert space for a single particle of type @xmath45 is just @xmath46 , defined using a measure on @xmath45 that is invariant under these operations . in an easy generalization of 3d @xmath0 theory , we can study the exotic statistics of ` particles of type @xmath45 ' for any quandle @xmath45 equipped with an invariant measure .",
    "this takes advantage of the well - known relation between quandles and the braid group @xcite",
    ".      it would be wonderful to generalize all the above results to 4d gravity , but for now all we can handle is a simpler theory : 4d @xmath0 theory .",
    "this may eventually be relevant to gravity , since one can describe general relativity in 4 dimensions either as the result of _ constraining _ 4d @xmath0 theory with a certain gauge group , or _ perturbing around _",
    "4d @xmath0 theory with some other gauge group .",
    "the first approach goes back to plebanski @xcite , and it underlies a great deal of work on spin foam models of quantum gravity @xcite , especially the barrett  crane model .",
    "the second approach goes back to macdowell and mansouri @xcite , and has recently been explored by freidel and starodubtsev @xcite .",
    "however , we do not dwell on these possible applications here .",
    "they only focus our attention towards certain choices of gauge group : @xmath55    our idea is simply to increase the dimension of everything in the previous section by 1 .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath0 theory on a 4-dimensional spacetime with the worldsheets of several ` closed strings ' removed .",
    "we focus on the case where the manifold representing space is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is an ` @xmath8-component unlink ' : a collection of @xmath8 unknotted unlinked circles .",
    "a flat connection on @xmath58 gives us a group element for each circle , namely the holonomy of some standard loop going around this circle : @xmath59",
    "so , just as before , we obtain @xmath8-tuples of elements of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , any way to exchange the circles in @xmath57 gives a map from @xmath60 to itself .",
    "it is often said that exotic statistics are only possible when space has dimension 2 or less .",
    "however , this folklore only applies to point particles . as pointed out by balanchandran and others",
    "@xcite , exotic statistics are possible for closed strings in 3-dimensional space , since there are topologically nontrivial ways to exchange unknotted unlinked circles in @xmath2 .",
    "the statistics of such theories are governed not by the braid group @xmath10 , but by a larger group : the ` loop braid group ' @xmath61 .",
    "using recent work of lin @xcite , we show that this group is isomorphic to the ` braid permutation group ' of fenn , rimnyi and rourke @xcite .",
    "this is an apt name , because @xmath61 has a presentation with generators @xmath62 that describe two strings trading places without passing through each other , just as if they were point particles : @xmath63 but also generators @xmath64 that describe one string passing through another : @xmath65 so , this group is a kind of ` hybrid ' of the symmetric group and the braid group .",
    "indeed , the elements @xmath62 generate a copy of the symmetric group @xmath66 in @xmath61 , while the elements @xmath64 generate a copy of the braid group @xmath10 .    in a one - dimensional unitary representation of the loop braid group , the permutation generators @xmath62 all act as @xmath67 , while the braid generators @xmath64 all act as an arbitrary phase @xmath68 .",
    "we could call particles that transform in this way ` abelian bose - anyons ' and ` abelian fermi - anyons ' , respectively .",
    "they act like bosons or fermions when we switch them using the generators @xmath62 , but like abelian anyons when we switch them using the generators @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath0 theory gives us more interesting unitary representations of the loop braid group : whenever the group @xmath1 is unimodular , we obtain a unitary representation of @xmath61 on @xmath69 .",
    "all the groups listed above are unimodular , so we get an interesting variety of exotic statistics for closed strings in 4d @xmath0 theory",
    ".    we can also restrict attention to a specific conjugacy class @xmath53 and get a unitary representation of the loop braid group on @xmath70 , as long as @xmath45 is equipped with a measure invariant under conjugation .",
    "as already mentioned , in the case of 3d gravity a choice of conjugacy class in @xmath23 essentially amounts to choosing a specific _ mass _ for our point particles , which is a very natural thing to do . in the case of 4d @xmath0 theory with @xmath71 , choosing a conjugacy class essentially amounts to choosing a specific _ mass density _ for our closed strings .",
    "the loop braid group @xmath61 consists of all ways a collection of oriented , unknotted , unlinked circles can move around in @xmath2 and come back to their original positions , perhaps trading places .",
    "more precisely , it consists of ` isotopy classes ' of such motions .",
    "this group thus plays the same role in describing the interchange of closed strings in @xmath2 that the symmetric group @xmath66 plays for point particles in @xmath2 , and the braid group plays for point particles in @xmath72 . in this section",
    "we use the work of lin @xcite to obtain two presentations of the loop braid group .",
    "first , however , we explain the sense in which the loop braid group , the symmetric group and the braid group are all examples of ` motion groups ' .",
    "the general idea of a ` motion group ' goes back at least to dahm s 1962 thesis @xcite , which unfortunately was never published . in the 1970 s and 80 s ,",
    "some papers by wattenberg @xcite and goldsmith @xcite clarified and expanded on dahm s work .",
    "more recently , mccool @xcite and rubinsztein @xcite have studied the motion group for unknotted and unlinked circles in @xmath2 .",
    "surya has also given a description of the loop braid group as an iterated semidirect product @xcite .",
    "much of this work considers the motion of unoriented circles .",
    "since we use oriented circles , we obtain a smaller motion group , which lacks the ` circle - flipping ' operations that reverse orientations .    quite generally ,",
    "suppose that @xmath73 is a smooth oriented manifold and @xmath74 is a smooth oriented submanifold .",
    "let @xmath75 be the group of orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath76 be the subgroup of @xmath75 maps that restrict to give orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath57 .",
    "we define a * motion * of @xmath57 in @xmath73 to be a smooth map @xmath77 \\times s \\to s$ ] , which we write as @xmath78 ( @xmath79 $ ] ) , with the following properties :    * for all @xmath80 , @xmath81 lies in @xmath75 ; * for all @xmath80 sufficiently close to @xmath82 , @xmath81 is the identity ; * for all @xmath80 sufficiently close to @xmath3 , @xmath81 is independent of @xmath80 and lies in @xmath76 .",
    "intuitively , a motion is a way of moving @xmath57 through @xmath73 so that it comes back to itself  not pointwise , but as a set  at @xmath83 .",
    "this suggests that one can ` multiply ' motions by doing one after the other , and indeed this is true .",
    "given motions @xmath84 and @xmath85 , one can define a motion @xmath86 called their * product * as follows : @xmath87 given a motion @xmath84 we can also define a motion called its * reverse * , denoted @xmath88 , by : @xmath89 we say two motions @xmath84 and @xmath85 are * equivalent * if @xmath90 is smoothly homotopic , as a path in @xmath75 with fixed endpoints , to a path that lies entirely in @xmath76 .",
    "one can check that this is indeed an equivalence relation and that the operations of product and reverse make equivalence classes of motions into a group .",
    "this is called the * motion group * @xmath91 .",
    "next we turn to examples :    * when @xmath92 is a collection of @xmath8 points and @xmath93 , @xmath94 is the symmetric group @xmath66 . * when @xmath95 is a collection of @xmath8 points , @xmath96 is the braid group @xmath10 .",
    "* when @xmath97 is a collection of @xmath8 unknotted and unlinked oriented circles , we call @xmath98 the * loop braid group * @xmath61 .",
    "we shall use the work of lin @xcite to give two presentations of @xmath61 .",
    "first note that there is a homomorphism @xmath99 which simply forgets the details of the braiding , remembering only how the circles get permuted in the process .",
    "the image of @xmath26 is all of @xmath66 .",
    "we call the kernel of @xmath26 the * pure loop braid group * @xmath100 .",
    "suppose , just to be specific , that @xmath101 where @xmath102 are disjoint unit circles in the @xmath50 plane , lined up from left to right with their centers on the @xmath103 axis .",
    "lin proves that @xmath100 has a presentation with generators @xmath104 for @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "the generator @xmath104 describes a motion in which the @xmath107th circle floats up and over the @xmath108th circle , shrinks slightly and passes down through the @xmath108th circle , expands to its original size , and then moves straight back to its starting position . we draw this as follows :",
    "@xmath109 where for purely artistic reasons we let the @xmath108th circle move a bit to the left in the process .",
    "here we are using a drawing style adapted from carter and saito s work on surfaces in 4 dimensions @xcite .",
    "crossings in a braid or knot are usually drawn with an artificial ` break ' in one of the strands to indicate that it lies under the other : @xmath110 similarly , carter and saito draw 3d projections of knotted surfaces in 4 dimensions , indicating by a broken surface which one passes ` under ' the other in the suppressed fourth dimension . in our context , we take this suppressed dimension to be one of the spatial dimensions , in order to make room for _ time _ , which we decree to flow downward in all our diagrams .",
    "the broken surfaces in @xmath104 indicate whether one circle is above or below the other in the suppressed spatial dimension , so that the following diagram and ` movie ' illustrate the same process : @xmath111{ltrmovie.ps } } ; \\endxy\\ ] ] the inverse of @xmath104 is of course obtained by running the movie backwards , which in diagrammatic notation becomes : @xmath112 one advantage of this drawing style is that it immediately suggests reidemeister  like moves for loop braids , such as this : @xmath113 we shall study the loop braid group algebraically , relying on such diagrams for our intuition .    given lin s presentation of @xmath100 , we can obtain a presentation of @xmath61 using the short exact sequence @xmath114 first , note that there is a homomorphism @xmath115 which takes a given permutation to what lin calls a ` permutation path ' in the motion group : a loop braid in which circles trade places without any circle passing through another in a topologically nontrivial way .",
    "for example , we can have them trade places while remaining on the @xmath50 plane .",
    "this map @xmath108 is well - defined since all such permutation paths are homotopic .",
    "moreover , the composite @xmath116 is the identity homomorphism on @xmath66 , so @xmath108 is a splitting of the short exact sequence above .",
    "since @xmath108 is one - to - one , we may identify elements of @xmath66 with their images in @xmath61 . since @xmath100 is a normal subgroup , elements of @xmath66 act on @xmath100 via conjugation .",
    "this allows us to define the semidirect product @xmath117 , and thanks to our split exact sequence , we get an isomorphism @xmath118 with inverse @xmath119    writing the loop braid group as a semidirect product in this way , we easily obtain a presentation for it :    [ presentation1 ] the loop braid group @xmath61 has a presentation with generators @xmath62 for @xmath120 and @xmath104 for @xmath121 with @xmath106 , together with the following relations :    the relations for the standard generators @xmath62 of @xmath66 : @xmath122    lin s relations for the generators @xmath104 of @xmath100 : @xmath123    relations expressing the action of @xmath66 on @xmath100 : @xmath124    * proof . *  since the presentation ( @xmath125 ) of @xmath66 is well - known , and lin @xcite proved that @xmath100 has the presentation ( @xmath126 ) , to present their semidirect product @xmath61 it suffices to add relations that express the result of conjugating any of lin s generators @xmath104 by the symmetric group generators @xmath127 .",
    "for @xmath120 we have : @xmath128    for @xmath129 and @xmath130 all distinct , we have : @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath133 distinct , we have : @xmath134 and using a similar picture we see that for @xmath135 and @xmath108 distinct , @xmath136 .",
    "the reader may notice that we have not included all possible conjugations of generators of @xmath100 by generators of @xmath66we would naively expect two additional such classes , yielding two more relations : @xmath137 but these follow , respectively , from ( [ rel9 ] ) and ( [ rel11 ] ) combined with ( [ rel3 ] ) .",
    "so , we have precisely the relations in part @xmath138 , as desired .    from this presentation of the loop braid group",
    "we now derive a presentation with fewer generators .",
    "we keep all the generators @xmath62 , but replace the @xmath104 with new generators defined as follows : @xmath139 for @xmath120 .",
    "we can draw these as follows : @xmath140 where we twist the picture a bit in the second step . to see that the generators @xmath62 and @xmath64 indeed give a new presentation , note that we can express the old generators @xmath104 in terms of these new ones as follows .",
    "first , repeatedly applying ( [ rel9 ] ) we obtain : @xmath141 if instead of ( [ rel9 ] ) we use its equivalent form ( [ rel9prime ] ) , we obtain : @xmath142 rewriting these in terms of the new generators @xmath64 , and in the second case using relation ( [ rel7 ] ) , we obtain a way to write @xmath104 in terms of the new generators : @xmath143 sometimes it is more convenient to use an alternate formula , obtained by applying ( [ rel11 ] ) , its equivalent form ( [ rel11prime ] ) , and ( [ rel7 ] ) again : @xmath144 what these formulas say is that when @xmath145 we can construct the loop braid @xmath104 by permuting either the @xmath107th circle or the @xmath108th until they are adjacent , braiding one through the other , and then permuting the circles back to where they started .",
    "the nice thing about using @xmath62 and @xmath64 as generators of the loop braid group is that @xmath62 describes how two neighboring circles can trade places by going around each other : @xmath146 while @xmath64 describes how two neighboring circles can trade places with the right one passing over and then down through the left one : @xmath147 as a result , the generators @xmath62 generate a subgroup of @xmath61 isomorphic to the symmetric group @xmath66 , while the @xmath64 generate a subgroup isomorphic to the braid group @xmath10 .",
    "there are also ` mixed relations ' involving generators of both kinds :    [ presentation2 ] the loop braid group @xmath61 has a presentation with generators @xmath62 and @xmath64 for @xmath120 together with the following relations :    * relations for the standard generators @xmath62 of @xmath66 : @xmath148 * relations for the standard generators @xmath64 of @xmath10 : @xmath149 * the following * mixed relations * : @xmath150    * proof . *  the proof is somewhat lengthy , so we defer it to the appendix .",
    "it is , however , simple to convince oneself using pictures that the given relations express topologically allowed moves for loop braids .",
    "perhaps the least obvious of these is ( [ rel9 ] ) , for which we supply a visual proof below : @xmath151    if we omit relations ( [ rel9 ] ) we obtain the ` virtual braid group ' @xmath152 of vershinin @xcite .",
    "this plays a role in virtual knot theory analogous to that of the usual braid group in ordinary knot theory . if we include these relations , which say : @xmath153 then we obtain precisely the ` braid permutation group ' @xmath154 of fenn , rimnyi and rourke @xcite .",
    "so , the loop braid group is isomorphic to the braid permutation group .",
    "the isomorphism @xmath155 yields a simplified diagrammatic way of working with loop braids , which is in fact the method used by fenn , rimnyi and rourke in their original paper on @xmath154 . in the theory of ` welded braids ' , the generators @xmath64 in @xmath154 correspond to the kind of crossings found in ordinary braids : @xmath156 , while the @xmath62 describe ` welded crossings ' , drawn like this : @xmath157 .",
    "these crossings are called ` welded ' because one imagines that the two strands have been ` welded down ' at the crossing .",
    "the point is that elements of the abstract group presented in theorem [ presentation2 ] can be represented either as loop braid diagrams or as welded braid diagrams , as follows :    @xmath158 for the _ pure _ loop braid group @xmath100 , the above correspondence implies the following welded braid pictures of the generators @xmath159 and their inverses : @xmath160 the other generators @xmath104 can be obtained from these by conjugation , using ( [ generatorcorrespondence1 ] ) or ( [ generatorcorrespondence2 ] ) .",
    "for example : @xmath161    diagrammatic calcuations with welded braids  and hence with loop braids  can be carried out by using the usual reidemeister moves for real crossings , along with ` welded reidemeister moves ' : @xmath162 which are of course simply graphical restatements of the relations in @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the nonexistence of the following move : @xmath165 is the rationale for the term ` welded braid'we are not allowed to pass a strand under the weld .",

    "this is the naive configuration space for @xmath0 theory where we treat the bundle @xmath179 as variable .    applying schrdinger quantization to this configuration space",
    ", we obtain the ( naive ) hilbert space for @xmath0 theory : @xmath199 of course , defining this @xmath200 space requires that we choose a measure on the moduli space of flat bundles .",
    "alternatively , we can try to form a hilbert space @xmath201 on which @xmath1 acts as follows : @xmath202 again , this requires choosing a measure on @xmath193 .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 will only have a unitary representation on @xmath203 if this measure is @xmath1-invariant .",
    "in sections [ 3d ] and [ 4d ] we will show that for the two examples above , there is a ` natural ' choice of @xmath1-invariant measure on @xmath193 . in both these examples the motion group @xmath91 acts on @xmath204 and thus on @xmath193 . by saying a measure on @xmath193 is ` natural ' , we simply mean that it is preserved by this action .",
    "using such a natural measure to define the hilbert space @xmath205 , we obtain a unitary representation of the motion group on this hilbert space .",
    "this representation describes the statistics of point particles or closed strings in @xmath0 theory .",
    "as we have seen , in the first example the motion group is the braid group @xmath10 , while in the 4d case it is the loop braid group @xmath61 .",
    "so , we obtain ` exotic statistics ' in both cases . this fact is somewhat familiar in 3 dimensions , but less so in 4 dimensions .",
    "so , in the following sections we first review the 3d case , and then move on to the 4d case after a brief digression on ` quandle field theory ' .    before doing this , however , let us see how the motion group acts on @xmath204 .",
    "the idea goes back to dahm s original work on the motion group @xcite , and it has been nicely explained by goldsmith @xcite . the idea is simple : elements of the motion group @xmath91 give equivalence classes of diffeomorphisms of @xmath173 , and these act on homotopy classes of loops in @xmath181 .",
    "the only problem is that the fundamental group is defined using _ based _ loops , and the diffeomorphisms used in the definition of the motion group need not preserve the basepoint in @xmath181 .",
    "luckily , wattenberg @xcite has shown that we can use compactly supported diffeomorphisms in the definition of the motion group without changing this group . in the examples",
    "above , we can assume without loss of generality that these diffeomorphisms are supported in a fixed large ball containing @xmath57 .",
    "so , if we choose a basepoint @xmath206 that is sufficiently far from @xmath57 , we can assume this basepoint is preserved by all the diffeomorphisms in the definition of the motion group .",
    "this makes it easy to check that @xmath91 acts as automorphisms of @xmath204 .",
    "[ 3d ]    now let us apply the general ideas of the previous section to the case of a plane with @xmath8 punctures : @xmath207 if we interpret these punctures as ` particles ' , we shall see that a state of 3d @xmath0 theory on this space describes a collection of identical point particles with exotic statistics governed by the braid group .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath181 is the free group on @xmath8 generators , so we have @xmath208 the @xmath8 group elements here are nothing but the holonomies of a flat connection around based loops going clockwise around the particles : @xmath209 having described particles as punctures in this theory , let us now consider what sort of statistics such particles obey .",
    "the previous section shows that the interchange of identical particles is described by an action of the @xmath8-strand braid group @xmath10 on @xmath60 , but we would like to work it out explicitly . for simplicity , consider the case @xmath19 and consider what happens when the two particles switch places . as remarked earlier , there are infinitely many topologically distinct ways for the particles to move around each other , but they are all powers of the braid group generator @xmath210 : @xmath211 if the holonomies around the two particles are @xmath212 and @xmath213 : @xmath214 switching them via @xmath210 induces a diffeomorphism of the plane which deforms the loops around which the holonomies are taken : @xmath215 to see how the system changes in this process , compare the final frame in this ` movie ' to the first frame . given that @xmath216 describes the holonomies initially , a slight deformation of the loops in the final frame : @xmath217 makes it clear that the corresponding holonomies around _",
    "these _ loops in the final configuration : @xmath218 is @xmath219 . thus the effect of switching the two particles via @xmath210 is to send @xmath220 to @xmath221 .    we can work out the action of @xmath222 in the same way , or simply derive it algebraically from the fact that it must undo the effect of @xmath210 .",
    "the easiest way to remember the results is with this picture : @xmath223    more generally , we have a right action of the braid group @xmath10 on @xmath60 given as follows : @xmath224 as mentioned in the previous section , we also have a left action of @xmath1 on @xmath60 via gauge transformations at the basepoint @xmath225 .",
    "this works as follows : @xmath226    we would like a measure on @xmath60 that is invariant under both these group actions , so that the braid group and gauge transformations act as unitary operators on @xmath69 .",
    "such a measure exists whenever @xmath1 is * unimodular * , meaning that its left - invariant haar measure is also right - invariant .",
    "a lie group is automatically unimodular if it is compact , or abelian , or semisimple .",
    "in particular , the groups @xmath227 are all unimodular .",
    "since these groups act on minkowski spacetime in a way that preserves its lebesgue measure , the poincar groups @xmath228 are also unimodular . also , the identity component of a unimodular group is unimodular , as is any covering space of a unimodular group .    from this",
    "we see that the 3d lorentz group @xmath11 is unimodular , as are its identity component @xmath229 and the double cover of its identity component , namely @xmath230 .",
    "all these are reasonable choices of gauge group when treating 3-dimensional  or more properly , ( 2 + 1)-dimensional  lorentzian gravity as a @xmath0 theory .    given a unimodular lie group , haar measure is typically not the only measure invariant under conjugation : we can multiply haar measure by any function that only depends on the conjugacy class . as an extreme example , we can even try to multiply haar measure by a ` delta function ' supported on one conjugacy class .",
    "more precisely , we can look for a conjugation - invariant measure supported on a single conjugacy class of @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we might as well be working not with @xmath1 but with just the conjugacy class .",
    "it turns out that in the case of 3d quantum gravity , this amounts to studying identical particles _ of a specified mass_. this leads us to our next subject : quandle field theory .",
    "in the previous section we considered @xmath0 theory in 3 dimensions , and were led to a natural action of the braid group @xmath10 on the space @xmath60 for any group @xmath1 .",
    "notice that we did not actually need the multiplication in @xmath1 to define this action ; we only needed the operation of _",
    "conjugation_. this suggests that we can work more generally , replacing the group @xmath1 by some algebraic structure that captures the properties of conjugation .",
    "such a thing is called a ` quandle ' .",
    "more precisely , a * quandle * is a nonempty set",
    "@xmath45 equipped with two binary operations @xmath231 and @xmath232 called * left * and * right conjugation * , which satisfy :    ( i ) : :    left idempotence : @xmath233 ( i@xmath234 ) : :    right idempotence : @xmath235 ( ii ) : :    left inverse law : @xmath236 ( ii@xmath234 ) : :    right inverse law : @xmath237 ( iii ) : :    left distributive law :    @xmath238 ( iii@xmath234 ) : :    right distributive law :    @xmath239    for all @xmath240 . in general , the operations of left and right conjugation in a quandle are neither associative nor commutative .",
    "quandles were first introduced as a source of knot invariants by david joyce @xcite in @xmath241 .",
    "many examples of quandles can be found in the work of fenn and rourke @xcite and other authors @xcite . for us ,",
    "the most important examples come from taking a group @xmath1 , letting @xmath45 be any union of conjugacy classes of @xmath1 , and making @xmath45 into a quandle with @xmath242 we are especially interested in the case where @xmath45 is either the whole group @xmath1 or a single conjugacy class .",
    "we can do some of the same things with quandles as with groups . for example",
    ", we can define a * topological quandle * to be a topological space that is also a quandle in such a way that the quandle operations @xmath243 and @xmath244 are continuous @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a lie group and @xmath53 is a conjugacy class , @xmath45 becomes a topological quandle with the induced topology .",
    "given a topological quandle @xmath45 , we define an * invariant measure * on @xmath45 to be a borel measure that is invariant under left conjugation by any element of @xmath45or equivalently , invariant under right conjugation by any element of @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that @xmath245 for any @xmath246 and any integrable function @xmath84 on @xmath45 .",
    "as noted earlier , invariant measures on quandles are far from unique in general .",
    "in particular , we may multiply an invariant measure on a lie group by any class function and obtain a new invariant measure .    in the previous section",
    ", we saw that the @xmath8-strand braid group @xmath10 acts on @xmath60 for any group @xmath1 .",
    "but , since our argument relied only on properties of conjugation , it works just as well for a quandle .",
    "the idea is that we can braid two elements of a quandle past each other using left conjugation : @xmath247 the inverse braiding uses right conjugation : @xmath248 it is well known that with these rules , the braid group relations follow from the quandle axioms .",
    "so , generalizing our result from the previous section , we easily obtain :    [ 3dtheorem ] suppose @xmath45 is a topological quandle equipped with an invariant measure . then there is a unitary representation @xmath249 of the braid group @xmath10 on @xmath70 given by @xmath250 for all @xmath251 , where @xmath10 has a right action on @xmath252 given by : @xmath253 there is also a unitary operator @xmath254 on @xmath70 for each element @xmath255 , given by @xmath256    the operators @xmath254 represent gauge transformations when @xmath45 is a group , so we can think of them as representing some sort of ` gauge transformation ' even when @xmath45 is a quandle .",
    "of course , if @xmath45 is a conjugacy class in a group @xmath1 , there will be gauge transformations even for elements of @xmath1 that do not lie in @xmath45 .",
    "it is instructive to work out the details in the case of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "this theory can be viewed as a @xmath0 theory with @xmath1 being the connected lorentz group @xmath229 , or perhaps better , its double cover @xmath230 . in either case",
    "we shall see that different conjugacy classes @xmath45 describe different types of spinless particles .",
    "the hilbert space for @xmath8 particles of this type is @xmath70 , and theorem [ 3dtheorem ] describes the exotic statistics and gauge invariance of this @xmath8-particle system .    in quantum field theory without gravity on 3d minkowski spacetime , we can describe the energy - momentum of a particle by an element @xmath257 : @xmath258 note that @xmath259 the adjoint action of @xmath230 on its lie algebra : @xmath260 preserves the determinant of @xmath26 .",
    "so , the adjoint action gives an action of @xmath230 as lorentz transformations on the space of energy - momenta .",
    "as explained in the introduction , an orbit of this action is just a type of spin - zero particle .",
    "when we turn on gravity , we must describe energy - momenta not by elements of the lie algebra @xmath261 but by elements of the group @xmath230 .",
    "particle types are then described not by adjoint orbits but by conjugacy classes @xmath262 . however ,",
    "this new description is compatible with the old one , at least for energy - momenta that are small compared to the planck energy @xmath51 .",
    "the reason is that we can identify group elements near the identity with lie algebra elements via the map @xmath263 this maps any adjoint orbit of @xmath261 into a conjugacy class of @xmath230 .",
    "indeed , it gives a one - to - one correspondence between the set of adjoint orbits close to @xmath264 and the set of conjugacy classes close to @xmath265 .",
    "but , as mentioned in the introduction , important differences show up for large energy - momenta .",
    "to understand the conjugacy classes in @xmath230 , it is handy to use the representation @xmath266 which says @xmath230 is geometrically a ` unit hyperboloid ' in a space of signature @xmath267 . since conjugate matrices have the same eigenvalues , the _ trace _ and thus the number @xmath125 is an invariant of conjugacy classes .",
    "it is not a complete invariant , but it is except for matrices with @xmath268 .",
    "every matrix in @xmath230 is conjugate to one of these five kinds : @xmath269    some explanation of this table is in order .",
    "every ` rotation ' maps to a rotation in the connected lorentz group @xmath229 : in other words , a transformation that preserves a timelike vector in 3d minkowski spacetime .",
    "similarly , every ` boost ' maps to a transformation that preserves a spacelike vector , and every ` shear ' maps to a transformation that preserves a lightlike vector .",
    "since the two - to - one map from @xmath230 to @xmath229 maps the matrix @xmath4 to the identity , ` antiboosts ' get mapped to the same elements as boosts , and ` antishears ' get mapped to the same elements as shears .",
    "( an ` antirotation ' would be just another rotation . )",
    "the above chart counts certain conjugacy classes more than once .",
    "first of all , there is an overlap at @xmath270 , since the identity rotation is also the identity shear and identity boost .",
    "similarly , there is an overlap at @xmath271 , since a rotation by @xmath272 is also an antishear and an antiboost . finally , all shears ( resp .  antishears ) with @xmath273 are conjugate to each other , and all shears ( resp .",
    "antishears ) with @xmath274 are conjugate to each other . these are all the redundancies .    knowing this",
    ", we can list all the conjugacy classes in @xmath230 without any redundancies .",
    "however , it is less tiresome to list the conjugacy classes in @xmath229 , since the elements @xmath275 get identified in @xmath229 , so we do not need to worry about ` antiboosts ' and ` antishears ' .    here",
    "are all the conjugacy classes in @xmath229 , and the corresponding five types of spin - zero particles :    1 .   for any @xmath276",
    "there is a conjugacy class containing the image of @xmath277 this corresponds to a tardyon of mass @xmath278 .",
    "2 .   for any @xmath279",
    "there is a conjugacy class containing the image of @xmath280 this corresponds to a tachyon of mass @xmath41 .",
    "3 .   there is a conjugacy class containing the image of @xmath281 this corresponds to a positive - energy luxon .",
    "4 .   there is a conjugacy class containing the image of @xmath282 this corresponds to a negative - energy luxon .",
    "there is a conjugacy class containing the image of @xmath283 this corresponds to a particle of vanishing energy - momentum .",
    "the factors of @xmath284 here arise from the double cover @xmath285 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , masses of tardyons really take values in the circle @xmath286 .",
    "each conjugacy class @xmath287 admits an invariant measure which is unique up to an overall scale .",
    "so , theorem [ 3dtheorem ] applies : we can form a hilbert space @xmath46 for particles of type @xmath45 , and more generally an @xmath8-particle hilbert space @xmath70 , on which the braid group and @xmath229 gauge transformations act as unitary transformations .",
    "[ 4d ]    all the work in the previous two sections generalizes nicely from 3 to 4 dimensions , using the loop braid group as a substitute for the braid group .",

    "while the proof is straightforward , it is worth comparing theorem 5.1 of fenn , rimnyi and rourke @xcite .",
    "this says that the braid permutation group @xmath154 is the group of automorphisms of the free quandle on @xmath8 generators .",
    "since @xmath154 is isomorphic to the loop braid group @xmath61 , it follows that @xmath61 acts on @xmath252 for any quandle @xmath45 .",
    "the action is precisely as above .",
    "let us illustrate these ideas in the case where the gauge group is the connected lorentz group @xmath300 or its double cover @xmath301 . with either of these gauge groups , @xmath0 theory in 4 dimensions",
