    "nascent sun - like stars are surrounded by circumstellar material , which builds up the growing protostar as matter is accreted through a circumstellar disk .",
    "the accretion rate varies in time : the protostar s normal accretion at a low rate ( @xmath710@xmath8m@xmath2yr@xmath9 ) is occasionally interspersed by brief episodes of highly enhanced accretion @xcite .",
    "fu orionis - type variables ( fuors ) are the visible examples of episodic accretion . during their episodic `` outbursts '' , accretion rate from the circumstellar disk onto the star increases by several orders of magnitude , leading to a 56 mag optical brightening @xcite .",
    "the first fuors which defined the class ( _ `` classical fuors '' _ ) are in outburst for decades @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "information on their progenitors is almost non - existing .",
    "the most common assumption is that they are classii , or classi / classii transitional objects with massive disks and ( in many cases ) extended envelopes .",
    "recent results , however , demonstrate that deeply embedded classi objects ( e.g. , v1647  ori , @xcite ; ooser , @xcite ) and classii objects with very small disk masses and no envelopes ( e.g. , hbc 722 , @xcite ) could also show fuor - like eruptions . another class of young eruptive stars , called exors after the prototype exlup , exhibit typically smaller , shorter , repetitive outbursts @xcite .    on november 30 , 2014 , @xcite reported the discovery of a new outbursting star , 2mass  j06593158@xmath00405277 .",
    "optical spectra of the object obtained by @xcite and by @xcite , and infrared spectra published by @xcite and by @xcite are very similar to those of the classical fuors . our group has been monitoring the area around this source with a robotic telescope at bochum observatory near cerro armazones since 2010 .",
    "the optical light curves show that the object started a slow rising at the end of 2013 , and quickly brightened by about 3mag both in @xmath10 and @xmath11 compared to the quiescent level , reaching peak brightness at the end of october 2014 @xcite .",
    "thanks to the object s proximity to the galactic plane , its position was covered with a number of all - sky or galactic plane surveys , providing information on the system in its quiescent phase .",
    "thus , 2mass  j06593158@xmath040405277 offers a unique opportunity to study the progenitor of a classical fuor . here , we collect and analyze archival optical , infrared and submillimeter observations of the new outbursting star ( hereafter , `` the fuor '' ) , and discuss the structure of its circumstellar and interstellar environment .",

    "this source is first visible at 70@xmath19 m , and we could not unambiguously link it to any point sources at shorter wavelengths . at 70@xmath19 m",
    "it is already brighter than the fuor and clearly dominates the emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "the deep ukidss images reveal a faint nebulosity around the fuor , especially apparent to the south but visible to the west as well ( fig .",

    "its characteristic size is @xmath21 15@xmath13 .",

    "if the origin of the nebulosity is light from the fuor scattered by the circumstellar matter , then the nebulosity should be bluer than the light source , unless it is reddened by some dust along the line - of - sight .",
    "we speculate that the extinction needed for this may be provided by the massive envelope of the se component .    in order to find out whether the fuor is an isolated young star or there are other pre - main sequence objects in its vicinity , we obtained photometry on the ukidss images for several point sources within 1@xmath14 of the fuor . by plotting the objects on a @xmath22 vs.  @xmath23 color - color diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcd ] , left ) , we found that most of them are on the main sequence , or they are reddened main sequence stars with extinction up to @xmath24mag .",
    "in addition to the fuor , we found eight stars around the ttauri locus @xcite , one being the n component , while the other seven are marked in table  [ tab : data2 ] .",
    "this indicates that they are young stellar object candidates , thus the fuor is probably not isolated .",
    "in table  [ tab : data ] we collected all available pre - outburst photometry for the fuor . in the 0.45@xmath19 m range ,",
    "multi - epoch data is available , making it possible to search for variability in the quiescent phase .",

    "the object was constant within 0.15mag .",
    "this indicates that the object has a well - defined quiescent state , with accretion rate changes probably much smaller than what caused the recent outburst .",
    "based on the photometry in table  [ tab : data ] , we plotted the pre - outburst spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the fuor in figure  [ fig : sed ] with dots , the n component with squares , and the se component with asterisks .",
    "we only used points which can be unambiguously attributed to either of these three sources .",
    "thus , the akari / fis point at 65@xmath19 m , where the fuor and the se source are probably blended together , is omitted .",
    "the sed of the fuor indicates significant infrared emission from the circumstellar matter . on the @xmath22 vs.  @xmath23 color - color diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcd ] , left ) , the object falls onto the ttauri locus @xcite , suggesting that it is a regular ttauri star with negligible reddening ( @xmath28 0.5mag ) .",
    "indeed , its optical  near - infrared sed ( up to the @xmath26 band ) can be reasonably well fitted using a kurucz model of a late k - type or early m - type photosphere with effective temperatures between 3750k and 4250k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "excess emission compared to the stellar photosphere appears first in the @xmath27 band . until about 12@xmath19 m , the sed decreases like @xmath29 , typical for moderately flared disks @xcite . after about 12@xmath19 m , the sed starts rising again , suggesting the presence of an outer envelope .",
    "the n component has a sed shape similar to the fuor , indicating that it is probably a ttauri star as well , but with lower temperature and mass .",
    "indeed , it falls onto the ttauri locus in the near - infrared color - color diagram ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : envi ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tcd ] , left ) .",
    "the se component is probably a deeply embedded class0 object , invisible in the optical , and peaking at around 160@xmath19 m .",
    "its submillimeter spectral slope is @xmath30 .",
    "the fuor is situated in the galactic plane ( @xmath31 = 217.5 , @xmath32 = @xmath00.1 ) .",
    "the herschel images of this area suggest that it sits on top of a long , elongated filament corresponding to the ldn1650 molecular cloud ( also known as s287 ) .",
    "co observations by , e.g. , @xcite suggest a velocity of @xmath33 = 2628kms@xmath9 for the molecular gas , which gives a kinematic distance of 2.3kpc .",
    "however , supposing that the fuor is a low - mass pre - main sequence star , as suggested by its optical  near - infrared sed ( sect .",
    "[ sec : colors ] ) , its apparent brightness contradicts this relatively large distance .",
    "the pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks of @xcite predict that the absolute @xmath25 magnitude of a star in the 37504250k temperature range should be between 2 and 4mag for ages between 5@xmath510@xmath6 and 2@xmath510@xmath34yr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcd ] , right ) .",
    "the apparent @xmath25 = 11mag would then correspond to a distance range of 250630pc for the fuor .",
    "if the object is located at 2.3kpc , its absolute @xmath25 magnitude would be @xmath00.8mag , typical for much higher temperature young objects .",
    "the observed sed , however , peaks at near - infrared wavelengths , and could be consistent with a higher temperature photosphere only if significantly reddened . for instance , a @xmath35 = 6000k photosphere with @xmath36 = 2.3mag reddening would adequately fit the sed until the @xmath25 band .",
    "thus , due to the well - known degeneracy between the stellar temperature and the interstellar extinction , the central star can either be an unreddened low - mass m - type young star at a distance of about 450pc ( a representative value between 250 and 630pc ) , or a moderately reddened intermediate - mass f - type young star at a distance of 2.3kpc .    without a pre - outburst optical spectrum that could be used for stellar classification ,",
    "it is very difficult to decide whether the fuor is an unreddened m - star close - by , or a reddened f - star far away .",
    "there is , however , extra information that we can use to decide .",
    "we scaled a blackbody function to the 70@xmath19 m flux of the fuor , extrapolated to 850@xmath19 m , and used this flux prediction to estimate the total mass of the circumstellar matter .",
    "we adopted a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 . assuming 55k or 100k for the dust temperature , we obtained 0.06m@xmath2 or 0.01m@xmath2 , respectively , for a distance of 450pc , and 1.6m@xmath2 or 0.28m@xmath2 for a distance of 2.3kpc .",
    "a similar estimate can be done for the se component using the 500@xmath19 m spire flux .",
    "here we used 50k or 20k , and obtained 0.31m@xmath2 or 1.3m@xmath2 , respectively , for 450pc , and 8.2m@xmath2 or 34m@xmath2 for 2.3kpc . in the galactic plane",
    "there is no guarantee that the fuor and the se source is at the same distance .",
    "however , the fact that there is at least 2 ( or possible a few more ) ttauri stars and an embedded submillimeter source all within 1@xmath14 strongly suggests that they are associated to each other . in this case",
    ", the larger distance would give an unrealistically large total mass for the se component .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the young stellar objects in this area , including new outbursting star , are not associated with ldn1650 , but located much closer to us , probably around @xmath37 = 450pc",
    ". we will use this distance value in our subsequent discussion .",
    "in the following , we discuss the physical nature of the fuor in quiescence . the central star is a low - mass young star , with effective temperature of about @xmath35 = 4000k @xmath15 250k ( sec .",
    "[ sec : colors ] ) . the siess models in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcd ] predict a stellar mass of @xmath38 = 0.75@xmath39 0.25@xmath40 . by integrating the sed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] , we obtained a stellar luminosity of @xmath41 = 1.2@xmath42 and a total bolometric luminosity is @xmath43 = 4.8@xmath42 .",
    "following @xcite , we determined the bolometric temperature of the object , which is a distance - independent quantity .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 = 1190k indicates that the object is classii ( their fig .",
    "6 ) , and its age is approximately 6@xmath510@xmath6yr ( their fig .  4 ) .",
    "the circumstellar structure of the fuor resembles the canonical picture of classical fuors @xcite , where a young ttauri star is surrounded by a moderately flared circumstellar disk and an envelope . in our case , the total circumstellar mass is on the order of 0.010.06m@xmath2 , falling into the range of typical ttauri disks @xcite , and is somewhat lower than envelope masses measured by @xcite and by @xcite for fuors .",
    "the sed shows a conspicuous break at 12@xmath19 m , which may indicate an inner hole in the envelope .",
    "additionally , the envelope must have a cavity as well , through which we have an unobscured view of the star and the inner disk .",
    "the comparison of the sed with other classical fuors is not straightforward , because for them , only outburst seds are known @xcite . for this reason , we compare the sed in fig .  [",
    "fig : sed ] to the quiescent sed of the young eruptive star v1647ori dereddened by @xmath36=13mag ( fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the two seds exhibit similar shapes , and it is remarkable that even their absolute flux levels agree within a factor of 3 in the whole 170@xmath19 m range , strengthening our distance estimate for the fuor . from an evolutionary point of view , @xcite and @xcite",
    "proposed that fuors are young stars in transition from the classi to classii .",
    "the transition process is associated with the gradual dispersion of the envelope due to the repetitive outbursts . in this picture ,",
    "our results on the progenitor of the classical fuor candidate 2mass  j06593158@xmath00405277 indicate that it is an evolved fuor , approaching the evolutionary phase of a disk - only ttauri star .",
