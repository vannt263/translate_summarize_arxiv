    "taking advantage of quantum effects in meson decays provides a unique window on the mechanics of such decays .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis technique  @xcite is a unique way to measure decay amplitudes and phases .",
    "not only are these valuable inputs and a challenge to qcd , but also these parameters are necessary to extract fundamental parameters .",
    "specifically see jean - pierre lees contribution to these proceedings on the measurement of the ckm angle @xmath2 in charged @xmath3 decays using a dalitz plot analysis of @xmath4 .    in threshold production via resonance decays , the favored method for @xmath5 meson factories , the product mesons are in an eigenstate of  c. specifically the decay of the @xmath1 produced in @xmath5 collisions are  c  @xmath6 .",
    "this introduces correlations between the decays of the @xmath0 mesons produced in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "these depend on amplitudes for doubly cabibbo suppressed(dcs ) decays , @xmath0-mixing parameters , and strong phases all of which can be measured in samples of @xmath1 decays in which both @xmath0 decays have been identified as a flavor tag , a semileptonic decay , or a cp eigenstate  @xcite .",
    "i review results presented since the 2005 summer conference season .",
    "there are not a large number with all of them being preliminary results from the cleo collaboration .",
    "the various versions of the experiment are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the work discussed here is based on 9/fb of @xmath5 data collected by the cleo - iii detector operating in the region of the @xmath7 , and 281/pb of @xmath5data collected by the cleo - c detector operating at the @xmath1 , corresponding to 1.4 million @xmath8 pairs .",
    "the motivation for this analysis is to measure the strong phase in @xmath10 decays .",
    "a constraint on this phase can be used in the measurement of the ckm angle @xmath2 in charged @xmath3 decays as discussed here  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is done with cleo - iii data and the @xmath11 s are produced in continuum production with their flavor tagged by the charge of the soft pion in charged @xmath12 decays .",
    "the sample is about 600 events with a signal to noise of about two to one . for the dalitz plot analysis the charges",
    "are swapped such that all the decays are treated as if a @xmath11 is decaying . the dalitz plot",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : kkpi0dalitz ]        shows clear contributions from both charges of @xmath13 plus an oppositely charged @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the contributions to the dalitz plot are adequately described by just these three contributions plus a non - resonant amplitude which is assumed to be uniform in phase space and have a fixed phase which does not interfere with the resonant amplitudes .",
    "the projections of the dalitz plot on the three mass combinations are shown in figure  [ fig : kkpi0dalitz ] along with the result of a fit with the contributions described above .",
    "many systematic effects are considered .",
    "the largest effects are caused by considering other resonance contributions to the dalitz plot .",
    "none are found to be significant , but they do change the central values for the clearly observed resonances . the background is modeled with mass and mass difference side bands that are then fit to second order two - dimensional polynomials . allowing the parameters describing the background to vary is the next largest systematic uncertainty .",
    "the efficiency across the dalitz plot is modeled with a simulated sample that is generated uniformly across the dalitz plot and those passing all the analysis selections are fit to a two dimensional second order polynomial . again allowing these parameters to vary",
    "provide the third largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the effect of varying analysis details and procedures on the systematic uncertainty is small compared to the three effects described above .",
    "the analysis is preliminary .",
    "table  [ tab : kkpi0dalitz ] gives the    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tqca2 ]    for mixing and dcs parameters and the strong phase from the full analysis compared with the present knowledge from other experiments . while at this stage the analysis is not competitive cleo projects that with their full data set it will be producing results with a precision similar to world averages and with an orthogonal set of systematic uncertainties . this analysis depends on the assumption that the @xmath0 pairs observed from the @xmath1 are in the c  @xmath6 state , and they preliminarily measure the rate of cp@xmath16 states from @xmath1 decay at @xmath17 , where the error is only statistical .",
    "theoretical expectations are orders of magnitude below this .",
    "quantum correlations in charm decays provide a unique opportunity to study the details of decay dynamics . here",
    "i have shown two recent dalitz analyses that build on previous work and are probing strong phases and strong dynamics at new levels of precision .",
    "also i have shown how quantum correlations in threshold production give unique leverage and provide alternative ways to measure rare behavior in the charm sector .",
    "we can hope that results in this fascinating field continue to multiply to enlighten and challenge our colleagues .",
