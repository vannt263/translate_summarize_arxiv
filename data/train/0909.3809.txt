    "the solar tachocline is the transition zone between the uniformly rotating radiative interior and the differentially rotating convection zone .",
    "first discovered helioseismically in the early 1990s , it continues to be probed to this day .",
    "of particular interest is how thin it is ; the angular - velocity profile changes dramatically over no more than about 5% of the solar radius .",
    "this intense shear is one of the reasons why the tachocline is now generally believed to be the seat of the solar dynamo , with poloidal fields being sheared out to produce very strong toroidal fields .",
    "seefor reviews of many different aspects of the tachocline , including its role in the solar dynamo .",
    "given the combination of strong magnetic fields and shear , it was quickly realized that so - called magneto - shear instabilities could potentially play an important role in the dynamics of the tachocline .",
    "indeed , in other contexts , long before the tachocline was even discovered , it had been known that both magnetic fields @xcite and shear @xcite separately can lead to instabilities .",
    "the first to study this problem in the tachocline context were@xmath0 ; one very interesting result that they obtained was that a combination of magnetic fields and shear can be unstable even though each ingredient separately would be stable .",
    "@xcite carried out a 2d calculation , confined to the surface of a sphere , with no radial variations allowed .",
    "subsequent work extended this to quasi-3d shallow - water and 3d thin - shell models , including also both linear onset and nonlinear equilibration studies .",
    "seefor a review of this work .",
    "we will consider a different type of two - dimensionality , namely axisymmetric solutions .",
    "these have not received as much attention as some of the 3d solutions , but recent linear - onset calculations @xcite indicate that if the toroidal field is concentrated into latitudinal bands , instabilities may arise that shred the field in the radial direction .",
    "in this paper we consider the nonlinear evolution of such banded fields . for purely toroidal , untwisted flux tubes ,",
    "we obtain results in good qualitative agreement with the linear - onset calculations . for mixed toroidal plus poloidal , twisted flux tubes ( which were not considered before )",
    "we show that the field evolves not just _ via _ the onset of instabilities , but much more directly , simply because in general it is not an equilibrium solution of the governing equations . for twisted flux tubes",
    "there is then a variety of possible outcomes , depending on the strengths of both the toroidal and poloidal components .",
    "the equations we wish to solve are the ( boussinesq ) navier - stokes equation @xmath1 the magnetic induction equation @xmath2 and the entropy equation @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the fluid and alfvn velocities , respectively , and @xmath6 the entropy .",
    "@xmath7 is the brunt - visl frequency , assumed constant .",
    "length has been scaled by the inner edge of the tachocline , so we will be interested in solving this system in the interval @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "time has been scaled by the equatorial rotation frequency , @xmath4 and @xmath5 as length / time .    except for the inclusion of the diffusive terms @xmath9 ,",
    "these equations are the same as in@xmath0 , hereafter referred to as cdg08 .",
    "some diffusivity must be included here to ensure numerical stability , but values in the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 yielded similar results , indicating that diffusivity is not significantly affecting the evolution .",
    "the results presented here are all at @xmath12 .",
    "while the equations may be much the same , the subsequent analysis is very different from that of cdg08 .",
    "they considered only the linear onset of instability , and only for high radial wavenumber @xmath13 , thereby ultimately eliminating @xmath14 entirely , instead simply having @xmath15 as a parameter in the equations .",
    "in contrast , we are interested in a direct numerical solution , in the finite interval @xmath8 $ ] , allowing an arbitrary radial dependence , and including also the full nonlinear evolution of the solutions .    for axisymmetric solutions , it is convenient to decompose @xmath4 and @xmath5 as @xmath16 the toroidal parts , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are the azimuthal components of the given vectors ; the poloidal parts , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are the streamfunctions of the meridional components .",
    "the original equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) then become @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26,\\eqno(10)\\ ] ] @xmath27.\\eqno(11)\\ ] ]    we then wish to solve ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , with stress - free boundary conditions @xmath28 ( 7 ) and ( 8) , with perfectly conducting boundary conditions @xmath29 and ( 3 ) , with @xmath30 at @xmath31 .",
    "these boundary conditions are somewhat artificial , but _ any _ boundary conditions would necessarily be artificial . to properly capture all of the dynamics of the tachocline",
    ", it should not be studied in isolation , but rather as part of a global model that also includes the interior and the convection zone . however , while there are models that aim in this direction @xcite , they are so complicated that one can not focus specifically on aspects such as tachocline instabilities . to study tachocline instabilities , one must therefore adopt simplified models such as ours , despite the inevitably unnatural boundaries where the real sun has none .",
    "we solve these equations using the numerical code described by@xmath0 , in which the radial structure is expanded in terms of chebyshev polynomials , the angular structure in terms of spherical harmonics , and the time - stepping is done _ via _ a second - order runge - kutta method .",
    "resolutions ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33 in @xmath34 were used , and were all checked to ensure that the results were adequately resolved .",
    "a timestep of @xmath35 was sufficiently small to ensure stability .",
    "to facilitate comparison with cdg08 , we choose initial conditions much the same as theirs .",
    "the initial entropy is simply @xmath30 , so any buoyancy effects arise entirely out of the subsequent evolution . for the flow ,",
    "we take the solar - like differential rotation profile @xmath36 , where we note that ( 1 ) is written in a non - rotating frame , so @xmath37 here must include an overall rotation , not just the pole - to - equator differential rotation @xmath38 .    for the toroidal field , we take @xmath39\\sin\\theta / r,\\eqno(14)\\ ] ] where @xmath40 .",
    "that is , @xmath18 consists of two oppositely directed bands in the two hemispheres , with position @xmath41 , latitudinal bandwidth @xmath42 , and amplitude @xmath43 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath44 is adjusted such that the maximum field strength @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "values of @xmath43 up to one , corresponding in dimensional terms to @xmath47 g , are of greatest interest in the solar context , but other ( especially younger ) solar - type stars may well have even larger values .",
    "we will present runs for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "a range of possibilities for @xmath41 and @xmath42 were considered , and yielded qualitatively similar results .",
    "we therefore show results only for @xmath50 , corresponding to bands situated @xmath51 from the equator , and @xmath52 , corresponding to a bandwidth of @xmath53 .",
    "thus far our initial conditions are exactly as in cdg08 ; see also@xmath0 , who were the first to introduce banded toroidal fields of this type . to this toroidal field , we now add the poloidal field @xmath54\\sin\\theta(r-1)(r-1.05 ) .",
    "\\eqno(15)\\ ] ] the poloidal field thus has the same banded structure as the toroidal , but @xmath20 is equatorially symmetric , whereas @xmath18 is anti - symmetric .",
    "both of these symmetries correspond to the standard `` dipole '' solutions of solar dynamo theory .",
    "the differing radial dependencies , @xmath55 for @xmath20 _ versus _",
    "@xmath56 for @xmath18 , are dictated by the different boundary conditions ( 13 ) that @xmath20 and @xmath18 are supposed to satisfy .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath57 is adjusted such that @xmath58 is @xmath59 .    the amplitude @xmath60 , so the factor @xmath61 gives the ratio of poloidal to toroidal fields .",
    "in addition to the @xmath62 , untwisted flux tubes , we will take @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the twisted flux tubes .",
    "the sign of @xmath61 determines whether the tubes are twisted in a left- or right - handed sense .",
    "it is not certain which is more appropriate to the tachocline @xcite , so we consider both possibilities , and show that they yield qualitatively similar behavior . regarding the amplitudes of @xmath61 , for @xmath48 and @xmath65 ,",
    "the maximum values of @xmath66 are @xmath67 . even for @xmath68",

    "@xmath81 , @xmath48 , and @xmath87 , corresponding to counter - clockwise circulation for the poloidal field .",
    "( incidentally , it is perhaps explicitly worth noting that because of the ten - fold stretching in the radial direction , @xmath88 is actually ten times greater than the spacing of the contour levels might suggest .",
    "so in fact @xmath88 is greater than @xmath89 . ) ]    turning to the variation with @xmath90 , we see that for @xmath91 the solution has changed significantly from its initial condition , whereas for @xmath81 it is almost unchanged .",
    "the reason for this is easy to understand : if initially only @xmath18 and @xmath17 are non - zero  and if @xmath20 is always zero  then according to equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) , the only way ( apart from the very weak dissipation ) for either @xmath18 or @xmath17 to change is by inducing a meridional circulation @xmath19 . now , according to equation ( 6 ) , the terms @xmath92 will indeed induce such a circulation ; these terms are zero only if @xmath93 , which in general is not the case .",
    "however , for increasingly strong stratification , the buoyancy term @xmath94 can very effectively suppress the tendency to drive a meridional circulation .",
    "that is , having only @xmath18 and @xmath17 non - zero is not quite an equilibrium solution to the governing equations , but if @xmath90 is sufficiently large , only a very weak circulation @xmath19 will be induced , so according to equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) , @xmath18 and @xmath17 will remain almost unchanged .",
    "this justifies linear stability analyses such as those of cdg08 , where a basic state is simply imposed for @xmath18 and @xmath17 . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will consider only the strongly stratified case @xmath81 .",
    "figure 2 shows the effect of doubling the field strength , to @xmath82 .",
    "now even the strong stratification is not enough to stabilize the solution .",
    "instead , we see the development of precisely the radial - shredding instabilities previously studied by cdg08 . here though we follow the full nonlinear evolution , and discover that by @xmath95 the instability has almost completely obliterated the original flux tube .    , @xmath20 , @xmath37 , @xmath19 , and @xmath6 , with contour intervals of 0.2 , @xmath70 , 0.1 , @xmath70 , and 1 , respectively .",

    "figures 3 and 4 show the results for @xmath48 and @xmath97 .",
    "that is , the amplitude @xmath48 is as in figure 1 , too low for the shredding instability to occur , and indeed it does nt .",
    "nevertheless , the solutions also do not remain virtually stationary , as in the bottom row in figure 1 . instead , we see the development of highly localized jets in the angular velocity @xmath37 .",
    "to understand their origin , we return to equation ( 5 ) , where the term @xmath98 is clearly responsible ; this term is zero only if contours of @xmath18 and @xmath20 coincide , which in general is not the case .",
    "furthermore , because there is no buoyancy force in this equation , no amount of stratification can suppress this effect , very much unlike figure 1 .    comparing figures 3 and 4 in detail , we note that reversing the sign of @xmath20 ( that is , the sense of twist in the tube ) has exactly the effect one might expect ; reversing the sign of @xmath98 simply reverses the jets .",
    "otherwise the evolution is much the same , and in both cases the flux tubes largely maintain their strength .",
    "note also that jets as concentrated as this would not be detectable by helioseismology , so phenomena such as these could conceivably exist in the real tachocline .",
    "figure 5 shows results for @xmath82 and @xmath96 .",
    "the toroidal field is therefore as in figure 2 , whereas the poloidal field is half as strong as in figure 3 ( so the nonlinear term @xmath98 is just as strong as in figure 3 ) .",
    "initially we see the same jets as in figures 3 and 4 ( and reversing the sign of @xmath61 again merely reverses the jets ) . by @xmath73 the evolution",
    "is dominated by the same shredding instability as in figure 2 , and the final result is much the same , with the original flux tube largely destroyed .",
    "poloidal fields as weak as this therefore have relatively little influence . however",
    ", if we increase the poloidal field strength to @xmath86 , it does have a very significant influence , as illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "the radial - shredding instability is now completely suppressed , and the flux tube persists up to @xmath95 ( and beyond ) .",
    "note also how the solution has adjusted itself so that contours of @xmath18 and @xmath20 do now largely coincide , and correspondingly these localized jets are greatly reduced in strength .",
    "we have considered the evolution of flux tubes in a thin spherical shell , intended to model solar - type tachoclines . for untwisted tubes",
    "we obtain the same radial - shredding instabilities that have previously been studied in the linear regime , and show that in the nonlinear regime these instabilities can very efficiently destroy the original flux tube , simply by shredding it to sufficiently short length - scales for it to dissipate .    for twisted flux tubes ,",
    "there are a number of possibilities . if the toroidal field is too weak for instabilities to set in , the solution will nevertheless evolve , _ via _ the formation of differential - rotation jets , driven directly by the lorentz forces associated with the twist in the tube .",
    "these jets induce a certain amount of structure in the flux tubes , but not enough to disrupt it as the instabilities did .",
    "if the toroidal field is sufficiently strong , and the poloidal field very weak , the shredding instabilities develop much as before , and simply overwhelm the jets driven by the twist .",
    "finally , if the poloidal field is somewhat stronger  but still much weaker than the toroidal  it can suppress the shredding instability .",
    "twisted flux tubes can therefore exist at considerably greater field strengths than untwisted tubes ."
