    "the unfamiliar dynamics at critical attractors of even the standard one dimensional nonlinear iterated maps @xcite-@xcite is of current interest to statistical physicists ; it provides insights into properties of systems at which the key supports of the canonical theory , phase space mixing and ergodicity , break down . at these attractors the indicators of chaos withdraw , such as the fast rate of separation of initially close - by trajectories .",
    "there is a small number of known routes to chaos and it is of interest to know if at their thresholds the dynamics displays similar features and if so to what extent .",
    "if present , these similarities would apply above the known universality of each type of critical attractor .",
    "critical attractors of nonlinear low - dimensional maps have always drawn much interest because they demonstrate the ways by which nonlinear systems bridge periodic and chaotic motion @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the geometrical properties of these attractors have been known for a long time @xcite-@xcite , but their dynamical properties are even now perplexing and still need to be fully understood . renewed interest in this subject @xcite - @xcite has focused on the applicability of @xmath1-statistics , the generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics proposed by tsallis @xcite , tsallis1 , to these nonlinear systems .",
    "important examples of critical attractors are the onset of chaos via period doubling , intermittence and quasiperiodicity , the three universal routes to chaos in dissipative maps displayed by the prototypical logistic and circle maps @xcite - @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting types of critical attractors are critical strange nonchaotic attractors @xcite as in the period doubling and quasiperiodic onset of chaos .",
    "these are geometrically complicated multifractal attractors with a vanishing lyapunov coefficient @xmath5 and a sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath0 that does not converge to any single - valued function but instead displays a fluctuating pattern that grows as a power law in time @xmath6 @xcite - @xcite",
    ".    trajectories _ within _ a critical attractor show self - similar temporal structures , they preserve memory of their previous locations and do not have the mixing property of truly chaotic trajectories @xcite .",
    "a special version of the thermodynamic formalism was adapted long ago @xcite-@xcite to study the dynamics at critical attractors and quantitative results were obtained that provided a first understanding , particularly about the envelope of the fluctuating @xmath0 and the ocurrence of a so - called ` @xmath1-phase ' dynamical phase transition @xcite - @xcite .",
    "as shown below we uncover a complete and rich dynamical structure for @xmath7 and clarify its relationship to families of @xmath1-phase transitions .",
    "we explain how these transitions relate to distinct regions of the multifractal attractor , and their manifestation in the universal jump discontinuities of the trajectory scaling function @xmath8 @xcite - mainieri1 .",
    "we clarify also the relationship of the thermodynamic approach with @xmath1-statistics with regards to the dynamical properties studied .",
    "recently , rigorous results have been developed @xcite - robledo8 that support the validity of @xmath1-statistics ( outlined in the next paragraph ) for the critical attractors associated with the intermittency and period - doubling routes to chaos , i.e. the tangent bifurcation and the accumulation point of the pitchfork bifurcations , but studies of the same type have not been carried out for the quasiperiodic route to chaos .",
    "here we present results on this route by considering the proverbial golden - mean onset of chaos in the critical circle map @xcite , @xcite and show that there are elements of universality in their dynamical properties as they appear in close correspondence with those recently analyzed for the feigenbaum attractor @xcite .",
    "the central point of the @xmath1-statistics with regards to the description of the dynamics of critical attractors is a sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath9 related to the @xmath1-exponential functional form , i.e. the ` @xmath1-deformed ' exponential function @xmath10^{-1/(q-1)}$ ] @xcite , @xcite . from such @xmath0 one or more spectra of @xmath1-generalized lyapunov coefficients",

    "we find that @xmath0 at the golden - mean onset of chaos takes the form of a family of interwoven @xmath1-exponentials .",
    "the @xmath1-indexes appear in conjugate pairs , @xmath1 and @xmath16 , as these correspond to switching starting and finishing trajectory positions .",
    "we show that @xmath1 and @xmath17 are related to the occurrence of pairs of dynamical @xmath1-phase transitions that connect qualitatively different regions of the attractor @xcite - @xcite .",
    "these transitions are identified as the source of the special values for the entropic index @xmath1 , and these values are determined by the universality class parameters to which the attractor belongs . in our present case the parameters are the golden - mean winding number @xmath18 and the universal constants ( in the sense of feigenbaum s trajectory scaling function @xmath8",
    "@xcite - @xcite ) that measure the power - law clustering of iterate positions .",
    "the most prominent of the universal constants is @xmath19 , that appears in the description of the most rarefied region and ( as @xmath20 ) of the most crowded region of the multifractal attractor .",
    "we are interested here in determining the detailed dependence of the aforementioned dynamical structure for the golden - mean chaos threshold on _ both _ the initial position and the observation time @xmath6 as this dependence is preserved by the infinite memory of trajectories . to this purpose",
    "we recall in the following section 2 the familiar features of the circle map , and the properties of the renormalization group ( rg ) fixed - point map for a cubic inflection point with zero slope .",
    "then in section 3 we describe the organization of the superstable trajectory at the chaos threshold into families of positions that lie along power laws in time . assisted by these properties , in section 4",
    "we determine the sensitivity @xmath7 for trajectories that have their starting and finishing positions at the most crowded and most sparse regions of the multifractal attractor . in section 5 we explain how the properties for @xmath0 and its @xmath2 spectrum are related to the occurrence of dynamical @xmath1-phase transitions and corroborate previously obtained numerical results . in section 6",
    "we express @xmath0 in terms of the discontinuities of the trajectory scaling function @xmath8 that measures local contraction rates within the multifractal attractor . from this relationship",
    "we obtain results for trajectories that involve other multifractal regions and show that the dynamics consists of a hierarchy of @xmath1-indexes and @xmath1-phase transitions . in section 7",
    "we summarize our results and further disscuss the links between the thermodynamic and @xmath1-statistical schemes and call attention to the usefulness of the latter .",
    "to assist our presentation in the following sections we recall here basic features of the circle map @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the map is given by@xmath21where the control parameters @xmath22  and @xmath23 are the bare winding number and the amount of nonlinearity , respectively .",
    "an important parameter for the description of the structure of the trajectories of this map is the dressed winding number@xmath24the average increment of @xmath25 per iteration .",
    "the map is monotonic and invertible for @xmath26 , develops a cubic inflexion point at @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 , see figs .",

    "are periodic ( locked motion ) when @xmath31 is rational and quasiperiodic ( unlocked motion ) when @xmath31 is irrational .",
    "the winding number @xmath32 forms a ` devil s staircase ' making a step at each rational @xmath33 and remaining constant @xmath34 for a range of @xmath22 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the critical circle map , locked motion covers the entire @xmath22 interval leaving only a multifractal set of unlocked @xmath35 .",
    "the threshold to chaos is obtained at the accumulation points of sequences of control parameter values of families of periodic trajectories . at these",
    "accumulation points the trajectories are quasiperiodic . for @xmath30",
    "the regions of periodic motion ( arnold tongues ) overlap leading to chaotic motion .    a standard way to study the quasiperiodic route to chaos is to fix the value of @xmath29 and select an irrational @xmath31 .",
    "then a choice is made of successive rational values for @xmath22 to obtain an infinite sequence of winding numbers that approach @xmath31 . a convenient sequence of such rational values for @xmath22 are given by consecutive truncations of the continued fraction expansion of @xmath31 . a well - studied , an perhaps the most interesting , case is the sequence of rational approximants to @xmath18 , the reciprocal of the golden mean , that yields the winding numbers @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the fibonacci numbers @xmath38 @xmath39 . within the range of @xmath22 for which @xmath40 @xmath41",
    "one observes trajectories of period @xmath37 , and therefore a route to chaos consists of an infinite family of periodic orbits with increasing periods of values @xmath37 , @xmath42 .",
    "it has proved useful to single out from these families the periodic trajectories with the ` superstable ' property .",
    "we recall that a superstable orbit @xcite , @xcite is an orbit of period @xmath43 such that @xmath44 . in our case",
    "a superstable orbit is one that contains as one of its positions @xmath27 .",

    "2 we show the values for the lyapunov coefficients @xmath62 for @xmath29 as a function of @xmath22 where the locations of the two superstable families are clearly seen and those for their accumulation points are indicated .    a celebrated development @xcite , @xcite dating from the early 80 s is the recognition that the quasiperiodic route to chaos displays universal scaling properties .",
    "the analysis was based on an rg approach analogous to that for the period doubling cascade , and can be suitably discussed in terms of the critical circle map .",
    "the universal properties are obtained from the fixed - point map @xmath63 of an rg transformation that consists of functional composition and rescaling appropriate for maps with a zero - slope cubic inflection point .",

    "the scaling is given by @xmath69 .",
    "related to the chaos threshold at the golden mean @xmath52 there is a multifractal set ( the attractor ) that measures the different degrees of clustering of iterate positions .",
    "this multifractal has a dimension spectrum @xmath70 within a range of values between @xmath71 and @xmath72 jklps85 .",
    "the most rarefied region of the multifractal corresponds to @xmath73 , and this region is mapped onto the multifractal s most crowded region characterized by @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the chaos threshold for especial values of the winding number is known as local universality schuster1 .",
    "we consider the last of the superstable trajectories , with infinite period when @xmath75 or @xmath76 and starting at @xmath77 .",

    "the constant slope values for the @xmath1-phase transitions at @xmath300 and @xmath301 appear again , but now we have two other pairs of transitions with slope values @xmath302 and @xmath303 , and , @xmath304 and @xmath305 , that correspond , respectively , to orbits that link the most crowded region of the attractor to the ` medium crowded ' region , and to orbits that link the ` medium sparse ' region with the ` most sparse ' region of the attractor . similar but more elaborated results are obtained when more discontinuities in @xmath223 are taken into account .",
    "these results reflect the multi - region nature of the multifractal attractor and the memory retention of these regions in the dynamics .",

    "we have examined in detail the structure of the superstable orbit at the golden mean critical attractor for zero - slope cubic inflection point maps .",
    "the knowledge of this structure allowed us to determine the sensitivity to initial conditions for sets of starting positions within the attractor .",
    "we found that @xmath0 is made up of a hierarchy of families of infinitely many interconnected @xmath1-exponentials .",
    "each pair of regions in the multifractal attractor , that contain the starting and finishing positions of a set of trajectories , leads to a family of @xmath1-exponentials with a fixed value of the index @xmath1 and an associated spectrum of @xmath1-lyapunov coefficients @xmath167 .",
    "the indexes @xmath1 and the spectra @xmath310 come in pairs , @xmath1 and @xmath311 , and @xmath167 and @xmath312 , as these correspond to switching starting and finishing trajectory positions .",
    "this dynamical organization is difficult to resolve from the consideration of a straightforward time evolution , i.e. the record of positions at every time @xmath6 for a trajectory started at an arbitrary position @xmath313 within the attractor . in this case what is observed @xcite are strongly fluctuating quantities that persist in time with a scrambled pattern structure that exhibits memory retention .",
    "unsystematic averages over @xmath313 would rub out the details of the multiscale dynamical properties we uncovered . on the other hand ,",
    "if specific initial positions with known location within the multifractal are chosen , and  subsequent positions are observed only at pre - selected times , when the trajectories visit another selected region , a distinct @xmath1-exponential expression for @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "subsequently , we explained that the above described properties for the sensitivity relate to sets of dynamical phase transitions .",
    "that is , the dynamics on the attractor consists of an infinite family of mori s @xmath1-phase transitions , each associated , as before , to trajectories that have common starting and finishing positions located at specific regions of the attractor .",
    "the specific values of the variable @xmath3 in the formalism of mori and colleagues at which the @xmath1-phase transitions take place are the same values for the tsallis entropic index @xmath1 in @xmath0 .",
    "the transitions come in pairs at @xmath1 and @xmath311 as they are tied down to the expressions for @xmath167 in @xmath0 .",
    "the dominant dynamical transition is associated with movement from the most crowded to the most sparse regions of the attractor ( or vice versa ) and the values of its relevant parameters coincide with those found in an earlier study with the use of mori s formalism @xcite . here",
    "we have determined the @xmath1-phase transitions via the direct evaluation of the spectra @xmath167 and @xmath176 in @xmath0 . also , we established a connection between the trajectory scaling function @xmath8 and the expressions for @xmath9 , such that the discontinuities of the former determine the @xmath1-phase transitions and the values for the @xmath1 index .",
    "conversely , from the @xmath1-exponential expressions for @xmath0 the scaling function @xmath8 can be conveniently determined .",
    "our results clearly apply to many other families of maps with zero slope inflection points of cubic nonlinearity and are likely to hold also for general nonlinearity @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "these results may be of relevance in condensed matter problems where the quasiperiodic route to chaos is involved .",
    "one interesting example is the phenomenon of the localization transition for transport in incommensurate systems , where schrdinger equations with quasiperiodic potentials @xcite are equivalent to nonlinear maps with a quasiperiodic route to chaos , and where the divergence of the localization length translates into the vanishing of the ordinary lyapunov coefficient @xcite .",
    "the dynamics at this type of multifractal critical attractor is also represented by a @xmath0 given by families of interconnected @xmath1-exponentials with @xmath1-generalized spectra of lyapunov coefficients @xmath167 .",
    "the latter quantities yield information on the power - law decay rates of multifractal - structured wave functions at the localization transition .",
    "our findings reported here are very similar to those recently determined for the feigenbaum attractor in unimodal maps @xcite , and reinforce the notion of generality of our identification of the source for the entropic index @xmath1 observed at critical attractors .      before concluding our analysis it is of interest to reconsider our developments in such a way as to illustrate the incidence and usefulness of the @xmath1-statistics in the description of the dynamics on the attractor at the transition to chaos .",
    "we return to the dynamical partition function in eq .",
    "( [ partition1 ] ) and rewrite it as@xmath314where the weight @xmath315 was assumed by mori and colleagues mori1 to have the form @xmath316 for chaotic attractors and @xmath317 for the envelope of fluctuations of the attractor at the onset of chaos , with @xmath185 a generalized lyapunov coefficient .",
    "the variable @xmath3 plays the role of a thermodynamic field like the external magnetic field in a thermal magnet or , alternatively , @xmath318 can be thought analogous to the inverse temperature .",
    "we note that @xmath315 can be written in both cases as@xmath319since @xmath320 with @xmath321 @xmath322 for chaotic attractors and @xmath323 for the envelope of the fluctuating sensitivity of the critical attractor @xcite . for chaotic attractors the fluctuations of @xmath324 die out as @xmath325 and",
    "this quantity becomes the ordinary lyapunov coefficient @xmath326 independent of the initial position @xmath327 .",
    "for critical attactors @xmath324 maintains its dependence on @xmath109 and @xmath328 but as we have seen @xmath329 is a well - defined constant _ provided _",
    "@xmath109 takes values from a time subsequence @xmath330 , as explained in sections 3 and 4 and shown in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "for simplicity we consider now only the case @xmath119 , i.e. the subsequences @xmath331 @xmath332 , @xmath81 for fixed values of @xmath111 , but it is important to note that every natural number @xmath109 appears in the complete set of subsequences .",
    "one branch of the envelope of @xmath0 with @xmath333 is visited at times @xmath109 of the form @xmath334 @xmath37 for which we find @xmath335 @xmath336 while for other time subsequences one has @xmath337 @xmath167 ( see eq .",

    "the next step is to consider the uniform probability distribution , for fixed @xmath167 and @xmath6 , given by @xmath345 , @xmath346 , where @xmath347 is the integer nearest to ( a large ) @xmath348 .",
    "a trajectory starting from @xmath333 visits a new site @xmath105 belonging to the time subsequence @xmath349 @xmath332 every time the variable @xmath159 increases by one unit and never repeats one .",
    "each time this event occurs phase space is progressively covered with an interval @xmath350 .",
    "the difference of the logarithms of the times between any two such consecutive events is the constant @xmath351 , @xmath159 large , whereas difference of the logarithms of the corresponding phase space distances @xmath352 and @xmath353 is the constant @xmath354 .",
    "we define @xmath355 to be the total phase space distance covered by these events up to time @xmath334 @xmath332 . in logarithmic scales",
    "this is a linear growth process in space and time from which the constant probability @xmath356 of the uniform distribution @xmath357 is defined . in ordinary phase space @xmath358 and time @xmath359",
    "we obtain instead @xmath360 .",
    "we then have that @xmath361where @xmath362 is the tsallis entropy for @xmath357 .",
    "the usefulness of the @xmath1-statistical approach is now evident when we recall from our discussion in the previous section that the dynamics _ on _ the critical attractor is constituted ( in its entirety ) by a discrete set of @xmath1-phase transitions and that _ at _ each of them the field variable @xmath363 takes a specific value @xmath206 . at each such transition",
