    "the evolution of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) is a key ingredient in our understanding of the star formation process . in particular , the low observed star formation efficiency ( sfe ) at the scale of whole gmcs ( @xmath12% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) remains a topic of strong debate , with there being two main competing scenarios that attempt to explain it .",
    "these scenarios refer essentially to the effect of the stellar feedback ( mainly from massive stars ) on the star - forming clouds .",
    "one is the scenario that the stars quickly disrupt their parent clouds by dispersal and/or photoionization , before the gaseous mass of the cloud is completely converted to stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , the sfr of active star - forming sites may be large for brief periods , and then halted by the very stars that have just been formed .    in the other scenario ,",
    "the role of stellar feedback is to drive turbulent motions within the gmc , which oppose its self - gravity , allowing it to remain in near hydrostatic equilibrium for times significantly longer than its free - fall time ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . in this case",
    ", the low efficiency of star formation would be due to the dual role of supersonic turbulence in self - gravitating clouds , of opposing global collapse of the cloud while promoting local collapse of turbulent density enhancements , which involve small fractions of the total cloud mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the reviews by mac low & klessen 2004 ; ballesteros - paredes  et al .",
    "2007 ) .    another controversy , related to the control of the sfe , refers to the nature of the motions originating the linewidths observed in gmcs and their substructure .",
    "the latter were initially proposed to correspond to gravitational contraction by @xcite , but this suggestion was quickly deemed untenable by @xcite , who noted that it would imply total galactic sfrs of the order of the total molecular gas mass in the galaxy ( @xmath3 ) divided by the typical free - fall time for a gmc ( @xmath4 myr ) , or @xmath5 yr@xmath6 , an estimate roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the observed galactic sfr .",
    "@xcite then suggested that the observed linewidths could correspond instead to random , small - scale turbulent motions , a notion that has prevailed until the present .",
    "however , a number of workers have recently advocated a return to the gravitational contraction picture , noting that various observational properties of clouds and clumps can be well matched by models dominated by gravitational contraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the notion of completely random , small - scale turbulent motions appears difficult to reconcile with the recent realization that the principal component of the velocity differences within clouds and clumps at all scales appears to be `` dipolar '' , indicative of coherent motions at the scale of the whole cloud or clump @xcite . in general ,",
    "several studies comparing simulations and observations have concluded that the motions in molecular clouds are consistent with large- , rather than small - scale driving @xcite .",
    "if a return to the collapsing scenario is to be considered , it is necessary to somehow avoid the @xcite criticism of it .",
    "this is actually not so difficult because that criticism neglects the internal structure of the gmcs .",
    "recent numerical studies of cloud formation by converging streams of warm neutral gas in the interstellar medium show that the clouds are born turbulent , due to one or more of the thermal , thin - shell , and kelvin - helmholz instabilities @xcite .",
    "the turbulence is subsonic with respect to the warm gas , but supersonic with respect to the cold phase , implying large density fluctuations in the latter .",
    "in fact , it has recently been proposed that molecular clouds may actually contain a warmer , atomic substrate in which colder molecular clumps are embedded @xcite . in either case ,",
    "the molecular cloud contains large , _ nonlinear _ density enhancements in which the local free - fall time is significantly shorter than the cloud s average .",
    "thus , once the global collapse begins , the local clumps may complete their collapses earlier than the bulk of the cloud .",
    "they can thus begin forming stars that can begin their feedback action on the gmc before it completes the bulk collapse .    in this paper , we present numerical simulations aimed at investigating this scenario , in which we use the same cloud - formation setup of previous papers @xcite , but including a prescription for stellar feedback mimicking ionization heating from massive stars . with this tool",
    ", we investigate the effect of the feedback on the global sfe of the evolving gmc , as well as the nature of the motions in the cloud , in a first effort to shed light on these issues .",
    "as we shall see , it turns out that the physical conditions in the clouds differ significantly from the `` normal '' picture , since accretion of gas from the warm diffuse medium is an integral part of the clouds dynamics and evolution , and thus the clouds can not be considered as isolated .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : model ] we describe the numerical code , and the implementation of our star formation and stellar feedback prescriptions . in  [ sec : simulations ] we describe the simulations , and in  [ sec : results ] we describe the results concerning the control of the sfe by stellar feedback and the nature of the `` clouds '' themselves . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present a summary and some conclusions .",
    "the numerical simulations used in this work were performed using the hydrodynamics + n - body adaptive refinement tree code art @xcite . among the physical processes implemented in art , relevant for our physical problem ,",
    "are the radiative heating and cooling of the gas , its conversion into stars , ionization - like heating from stellar feedback , and self - gravity , from both the stars and the gas .",
    "we use heating ( @xmath7 ) and cooling ( @xmath8 ) functions of the form    @xmath9    these functions are fits to the various heating and cooling processes considered by @xcite , as given by equation ( 4 ) of @xcite . as noted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , eq .",
    "( 4 ) in @xcite contains two typographical errors .",
    "the form used here incorporates the necesary corrections , kindly provided by h.  koyama ( 2007 , private communication ) . with these heating and cooling laws ,",
    "the gas is thermally unstable in the density range @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "paper i ) .      in art ,",
    "star formation is modeled as taking place in the coldest and densest regions , defined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the local temperature and number density of the gas , respectively , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively a density and a temperature threshold .",
    "we set @xmath17 k , which is easily satisfied by all cells with density @xmath15 , so in practice our sf condition depends on density only .",
    "a stellar particle of mass @xmath18 is placed in a grid cell where these conditions are simultaneously satisfied , and this mass is removed from the gas mass in the cell .",
    "thereafter , the particle is treated as non - collisional , and follows n - body dynamics .",
    "no other criteria are imposed . in each gas cell",
    "that satisfies the above criteria a stellar particle is formed with a mass equal to 50% of the gas mass contained in the cell . since the stellar particles are more massive than a single star , each stellar particle should be considered as a small cluster , within which the individual stellar masses are distributed according to some stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "stellar particles inject thermal energy at a rate @xmath19 erg myr@xmath6 per star with mass greater than @xmath20 contained in the stellar particle .",
    "we assume a @xcite imf , implying that each stellar particle of mass @xmath21 produces one 8-@xmath22 star .",
    "the energy is deposited in the cell in which the stellar particle is instantaneously located , over a typical ob stellar lifetime , which we assume to be 10 myr .",
    "it is important to note that , although initially we experimented with realistic values of @xmath19 based on the lyman continuum fluxes of stars with masses between 10 and 20 @xmath22 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found that , because all the energy is deposited in a single cell , and the neighboring cells are heated exclusively by conduction , rather than by radiative heating , the resulting hii regions were not so realistic .",
    "thus , we opted instead for taking @xmath19 as a free parameter , and adjusting it until we obtained realistic hii regions , with temperatures @xmath23 k , diameters of a few parsecs , and expansion velocities of a few tens of@xmath24 .",
    "note also that we resort to the common strategy of turning off the cooling in the cell where a stellar particle is located , so that the cell can reach realistically high temperatures . otherwise , the cooling can dissipate most of the thermal energy deposited in very dense cells . in the real ism",
    "this does not occur because the stellar heating is applied through ionization , so that the temperature reached in the star s immediate environment is independent of the medium s local density . instead , in the simulations , the cooling depends on the density , and the temperature resulting from the balance between the stellar heating and the cooling",
    "does depend on the density .",
    "this problem is avoided by turning off the cooling in the cell where the stellar particle is located .",
    "note that this contradicts claims that the need to turn off the cooling can be alleviated simply by increasing the resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we argue that this problem can only be alleviated by performing radiation - hydrodynamics simulations . in their absence",
    ", we consider that turning off the cooling is actually a _ better _ model of the effect of stellar feedback , because it allows mimicking the fact that the gas temperature in the hii regions is independent of the local density .",
    "finally , in order to further constrain the physical conditions in the hii regions , we also impose a `` ceiling '' to the temperature in the cell containing the stellar particle because otherwise , with the cooling off , the temperature in the cell might diverge .",
    "we set this `` ceiling '' to @xmath25 k.    although this procedure is mostly one of trial - and - error , we consider it to be the most adequate one for our purposes , since it is the hii regions that drive the turbulent motions in the dense gas in our simulations , and so it is them that must have realistic properties , even at the expense of a somewhat ad - hoc sf prescription . we show a typical hii region in our simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig : hii_region ] .",
    "the numerical box is initially covered by a grid of @xmath26 ( zeroth level ) cells .",
    "the mesh is subsequently refined as the matter distribution evolves .",
    "the maximum allowed refinement level was set to four , so that high - density regions have an effective resolution of @xmath27 cells , with a minimum cell size of 0.125 pc .",
    "cells are refined ( halved in linear size ) if the gas mass within the cell is greater than 0.32 .",
    "that is , the cell is refined by a factor of 2 when the density increases by a factor of 8 , so that , while refinement is active , the grid cell size @xmath28 scales with density @xmath14 as @xmath29 .",
    "once the maximum refinement level is reached , no further refinement is performed , and the cell s mass can reach much larger values .",
    "in particular , a stellar particle is formed when a fourth - level cell reaches a density @xmath30 , or a mass of @xmath31 , again assuming @xmath32 ( we use this value because we do not follow the actual chemistry , and thus we assume the entire box to be filled with atomic hydrogen . ) thus , a stellar particle typically has a mass @xmath33 .",
    "note that , because we use only four levels of refinement , the largest densities arising in the simulation are by far not sufficiently resolved according to the `` jeans criterion '' proposed by @xcite for adaptive - mesh codes . specifically , at our stellar - particle formation threshold density of @xmath34 , and assuming a gas temperature of @xmath35 k at that density , we find that the jeans length ( using the adiabatic sound speed ) is @xmath36 pc , while the minimum cell size , at 0.125 pc , is roughly 4 times larger .",
    "thus , according to those authors , one should expect artificial fragmentation to occur in our simulations .",
    "however , we do not consider this to be a problem because we are not concerned here with the numbers and masses of the stellar particles formed in the simulation , but simply with the _ total _ amount of mass that goes into stars .",
    "we consider four simulations using the same setup as in paper i , which represents the evolution of a region of 256 pc per side , initially filled with warm gas at a uniform density of @xmath37 and a temperature @xmath38 k , implying an adiabatic sound speed @xmath39 ( assuming a mean particle mass @xmath40 ) .",
    "the whole numerical box thus contains @xmath41 . in this medium",
    ", we set up two streams moving with the same speed @xmath42 ( corresponding to a mach number of 0.8 with respect to the unperturbed medium ) in opposite senses along the @xmath43-direction .",
    "the streams have a radius of 32 pc and a length of 112 pc each , so that the total mass in the two inflows is @xmath44 .",
    "the flows collide head on at the box s center ( see fig .  1 of paper i ) . to the inflow velocity field",
    "we superpose a field of initial low - amplitude turbulent velocity fluctuations , in order to trigger the instabilities in the compressed layer .",
    "we create this initial velocity fluctuation field with a new version of the spectral code used in @xcite and @xcite , modified to run in parallel in shared - memory architectures .",
    "the simulations are evolved for about 40 myr .",
    "the collision nonlinearly triggers a transition to the cold phase , forming a turbulent , cold , dense cloud @xcite , consisting of a complex network of sheets , filaments , and clumps of cold gas embedded in a warm diffuse substrate @xcite .",
    "the largest cold structures may become gravitationally unstable and begin to collapse .",
    "eventually , they proceed to forming stars , which then heat their environment , forming expanding `` hii regions '' that tend to disperse the clumps .    in the simulations reported here",
    ", we vary only two parameters : the amplitude of the initial velocity fluctuations and whether the stellar feedback is on or off .",
    "we consider a `` large - amplitude '' ( la ) and a `` small - amplitude '' ( sa ) case for the initial velocity fluctuations , for which the three - dimensional velocity dispersions are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we thus employ a mnemonic nomenclature for the runs using the acronyms la or sa , followed by f0 or f1 , indicating that feedback is off or on , respectively . table  [ tab : run_parameters ] summarizes the runs considered in the paper .",

    "the simulations performed here behave very similarly to previous simulations with similar setups , performed with other codes . in particular , our sa runs are very similar to run l256@xmath470.17 in paper i and the run presented by @xcite .",
    "the main feature of these runs is that , because the initial fluctuations are very mild , the flow collision creates a large , coherent `` pancake '' of cold , dense gas , which is able to undergo gravitational collapse as a whole .",
    "this results in the formation of a dense , massive , and turbulent region at the site where the global collapse finally converges , with physical properties similar to those of high - mass star forming regions @xcite .",
    "however , a recent study varying the parameters of the flow collision @xcite shows that the coherence of the collapse may be lost in the presence of stronger initial velocity fluctuations , and the sfe is decreased . in such cases , smaller clouds appeared to be less strongly gravitationally bound , with the effect of decreasing the sfe .",
    "this feature also happens in our la simulations , in which the cloud formed by the initial flow was much more fragmented and scattered over the simulation volume . as a result , sf also occurs in a much more scattered manner , and the sfes are in general smaller in the la runs than in their sa counterparts .",
    "however , in general a common pattern is followed by all simulations : the transonic converging flows in the diffuse gas induce a phase transition to the cold phase of the atomic gas , which is highly prone to gravitational instability .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the thermal pressure at our initial conditions is 5000 k@xmath48 . from fig .  2 of paper i",

    "these sizes and masses are easily achievable by a large fraction of the cold gas structures , which can then proceed to gravitational collapse and form stars . moreover , the ensemble of these clumps may also be gravitationally unstable as a whole , the likelihood of this being larger for greater coherence of the large - scale pattern",

    "we see that two sets of points are clearly defined in this plot , one for the clouds , and one for the simulations . in both cases , however , the trend of larger reduction factor at smaller dense gas mass is clearly observed , although , at the level of simulations , we see that their masses are not very different .",
    "thus , in this case the different reduction factors must include a contribution from the larger degree of fragmentation occurring in the la simulations due to the larger amplitude of the initial turbulent fluctuations .",
    "beginfigure        in order to compare the sfes in our simulated clouds with those of real molecular clouds , it is convenient to note that regions of low - mass star formation , such as taurus @xcite or the chamaeleon ii dark cloud @xcite generally have low sfes ( @xmath68 - 5% ) , while cluster forming cores have sfe @xmath69 - 50% @xcite .",

    "one crucial feature in all our simulations is that _ the clouds are accreting material from the surrounding diffuse medium .",

    "the accretion competes with sf and stellar feedback in regulating the cloud s mass and coherence , with important consequences .",
    "first of all , this implies that simple observational estimates of the sfe in gmcs based on measuring the stellar mass and dividing it by the cloud s mass may be failing to take into account the additional `` raw material '' for sf contained in the part ( or the whole ) of the atomic envelope of the clouds that will eventually be incorporated into the gmc .",

    "the smaller stellar mass is not surprising , as the obvious effect of stellar feedback is to reheat the cold , collapsing star - forming gas , thus reducing the sfr .",
    "however , the larger cold gas mass in the presence of feedback is indeed surprising , since both gas consumption by sf and the `` ionization '' by stellar feedback act to reduce the dense gas mass .",
    "our result implies that the rate of dense gas consumption by sf far outweighs its rate of destruction by stellar feedback , so that the net effect of reducing the sfr is to allow a larger amount of dense gas to be collected by the accretion .",
    "this scenario is supported by fig.[fig : total_mass_evol ] , which shows the total ( dense gas + stars ) in the clouds in the two sets of simulations .",
    "it is seen that the total cloud mass is nearly the same with and without feedback , suggesting that _ the total cloud mass is mainly determined by the accretion , while the ratio of dense gas to stellar mass seems to be mainly determined by the feedback .",
    "_    these results moreover support the suggestions by @xcite and @xcite that the majority of the gas in a gmc is not participating of the sf process at any given time .",
    "the latter authors suggested that this is how local regions of sf may have a very high specific sfr ( @xmath84 ) , while that of their whole parent gmcs may be much smaller ( @xmath85 ; * ? ? ? * ) . because it is injected by the newly formed stars , the stellar feedback acts preferentially on gas that is about to form stars next .",
    "this allows an efficient suppression of sf , through only a modest fraction of the total available dense gas being destroyed .",
    "that is , if sf is a highly localized process , then it is possible to achieve significant reductions of the sfr with only a modest reduction of the total amount of dense gas , by targeting the destruction precisely at the star - forming gas .",
    "this mechanism may also explain the trend observed in sec.[sec : sfe ] , that the sfe is more strongly reduced by the feedback in cases where the collapsing gas mass is smaller .",
    "this may be understood as a consequence of the fact that stellar feedback is localized , while the accretion is extended , and more so for greater mass of the globally gravitationally unstable region that will form the cloud .",
    "thus , as we observe in the animation corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : sa_cc_t265_zoom ] , the low - mass fragments that are undergoing sf while on their way to the central site of the global collapse in run saf1 are easily destroyed by their stellar activity . instead , the massive central cloud is not destroyed , as it continues to accrete mass from large distances at a pace that outweighs the local destruction by stellar feedback .",
    "clouds 1 and 2 in run laf1 , which do not involve such an extended collapse , are intermediate cases , in which the clouds are not destroyed by the feedback , but the latter is more efficient in reducing the sfe .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the efficacy of the feedback in destroying the cloud is maximal when its region of influence is comparable to the spatial extent of the infall , and is progressively reduced as the latter involves progressively larger coherence lengths .",

    "it is important to note that , with this prescription , variations in the value of the ratio come exclusively from the estimate of the virial mass , because it _ does _ depend on the weighting used , while the actual cloud mass is independent of the method of weighting .",
    "figure  [ fig : m_to_mvir ] shows the evolution of the ratio @xmath103 for the three clouds , showing the cases with and without feedback , and using volume- and density - weighting for the calculation of @xmath92 . in all cases we observe that , at advanced stages of the evolution , when the clouds have been fully assembled ( @xmath104 myr ) , this ratio is closest to unity when feedback is included and density - weighting is used in the calculation of @xmath92 .",
    "the cases with no feedback and density weighting are systematically lower than unity by factors @xmath105 - 10 . the cases with volume weighting are more strongly fluctuating , but it is noteworthy that the ratio often takes values close to unity anyway .        from these results , we conclude that , in the case with feedback , the clouds appear to be in a pseudo - virialized state with respect to the velocity dispersion of the dense gas ( highlighted by the density weighting ) . in this state , there is an approximate force balance between self - gravity and feedback driving",
    ". however , it differs from true virialization because of the presence of mass sources ( the accretion from the diffuse environment ) and sinks ( the consumption by sf and the destruction by stellar feedback ) in the system .",
    "these seem to self - regulate , so as to be capable of maintaining an approximately constant cloud mass while accretion persists . on the other hand , when the velocity dispersion of the warm gas is taken into account ( still in the case with feedback )",

    ", the clouds also appear to be sub - virial even with respect to the density - weighted virial mass estimate . in this case",
    "this appears to be a consequence of the dense gas being in free - fall collapse , and into a potential well produced not only by its own self - gravity , but also by the previously - formed stars that have fallen there too ( see * ? ? ?",
    "of course , our simulations are not free of caveats and limitations .",
    "two that stand out are the resolution and the nature of the feedback that we have included . concerning the resolution , in this paper we have used a relatively limited one , in order to speed up the simulations , at the expense of not fulfilling the jeans criterion proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , as explained in sec.[sec : refinement ] , we do not consider this a problem for our study , since we have restricted it to the global properties of the clouds , rather than their detailed structure , and we have avoided addressing issues related with the fragmentation of the final stages of collapse in the clouds , such as the mass distribution of the cores and stellar products .",
    "we plan to perform a higher - resolution study in a forthcoming paper , in which we can address these issues .",
    "the second limitation is the nature of the stellar feedback that we have considered , which in this study has been restricted to local heating representing the ionizing radiation from massive stars , similarly to the approach used by , e.g. , @xcite , neglecting other sources such as outflows from stars of all masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do this in part for the numerical simplicity of the approach , and in part because here we have been mainly interested in the sfe and and cloud evolution at the scale of gmcs , for which the expansion of hii regions is likely the main driver @xcite . however , the neglect of bipolar outflows may introduce a non - negligible bias in our finding that smaller - scale clumps are destroyed by the feedback , and this should be confirmed by future simulations that can better resolve these objects and include bipolar outflows .",
    "in this paper we have presented a numerical investigation of the evolution of dense ( `` molecular '' ) clouds , starting from their formation by transonic compressions in the warm neutral medium , followed by a phase transition to the cold neutral medium , the onset of gravitational collapse , star formation , and , finally , energy feedback from massive - star ionizing radiation and the formation of expanding hii regions .",
    "a crucial difference between the results from our simulations and other models and theories of the self - regulation of star formation and its efficiency is that the clouds in our simulations are in general accreting material at high rates from the surrounding diffuse medium , rather than having a fixed mass .",
    "this implies that _ the material making up a cloud is constantly being renewed over time _ because , on the one hand it is accreting fresh gas , and on the other it is losing mass to sf and stellar ionization .",
    "the star - forming regions can be considered to be not objects , but rather the _ loci _ where the gas is just `` passing through '' , from the diffuse - gas state to the `` star '' state , similarly to the nature of a flame , which is the locus of the gas undergoing combustion in a candle , with fresh air entering at its base , burning while it transits through the flame , and the exhaust gases leaving at the top .",
    "witin this framework , we have found that the sfe in the clouds is readily decreased by feedback to levels consistent with observational determinations _ at all times during the clouds evolution _ up to the maximum integration time of 40 myr that we have considered .",
    "this is a significant improvement over our previous non - magnetic studies of the sfe in the context of cloud evolution without feedback , in which the sfe at late times is often found to be excessive ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have found that the reduction factor upon the inclusion of feedback is an inverse function of the dense gas mass in the system , and of the degree of coherence of the global collapse , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfe_vs_mass ] .",
    "this result is complemented by the additional observation that low - mass clumps are fully destroyed by the feedback .",
    "together they imply that at some point , below a certain critical collapsing mass , the appearance of a stationary state may not occur anymore .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite , although their model does not include mass accretion onto the cloud .",
    "we plan to present one such model in a future paper .",
    "in general , our results may provide an explanation for the observational fact that regions of massive - star formation , which are themselves more massive than regions of low mass - star formation , appear to have higher sfes @xcite than regions forming low- and intermediate - mass stars @xcite .",
    "essentially , our results imply that _ the more massive the region , the less effective the feedback is in reducing the sfe . _",
    "specifically , these results indicate that the role of the feedback is not the same in all clouds , but rather depends on the initial conditions of the large - scale collapse that produces each individual region .",
    "regions in which the amount of mass involved in the collapse overwhelms the destructive action of the feedback may reach a stationary state that appears virialized , but in which there is actually a countinuous processing of material , since on the one hand the cloud is accreting mass from the outer infalling material , and on the other hand it is losing mass through consumption by sf and evaporation by the feedback . in this case ,",
    "termination of the sf episode probably requires the termination of the gas reservoir involved in the global collapse , and is independent of the feedback .",
    "however , this need not be in contradiction with the low observed global efficiency of sf , if only a small fraction of a gmc s mass is involved in the collapse at any moment in time , with the rest being either supported ( by , e.g. , the magnetic field ) , or in the process of dispersal @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the sf episode may be terminated upon the initiation of supernova events , which we have not included in the present study .",
    "an additional consequence of the mechanisms described in this paper is that the most massive clouds appear to actually contain more mass when feedback is included than when it is not .",
    "this suggests that , first , unimpeded sf is more efficient at removing mass from the dense gas phase to deposit into stars , than the evaporation of dense gas by the stellar feedback , so that , when the latter inhibits sf , the accretion onto the cloud accumulates larger amounts of dense gas than otherwise .",
    "second , this indicates that the deposition of the feedback energy into the clouds is accurately targeted to gas that is already on the verge of forming stars .",
    "if this gas is a minor fraction of the total dense gas in a cloud ( i.e , sf is a highly spatially intermittent phenomenon in molecular clouds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then its destruction is a highly efficient way to reduce the sfe without destroying a large fraction of the cloud .",
    "finally , we have also investigated the density pdf in the volumes containing the clouds in our simulations , finding that in general they retain the bimodal shape characteristic of thermally bistable flows .",
    "the pdf of the dense gas exclusively shows no turnover at low densities , indicating that low densities are most abundant .",
    "the high - density tails of the pdfs have power - law shapes , as expected for softer - than - isothermal flows , although this last result may be biased by our usage of a single cooling law appropriate for atomic gas , and extrapolating it to molecular - gas densities , rather than using a specific molecular cooling law .",
    "we expect to address this shortcoming in future works .",
