    "the traditional laplacian operator describes a variety of different phenomena as for example the distribution of electrostatic potential in a dielectric when an electric field is applied to it ( as for example by putting it into a capacitor ) . in this case",
    "the potential varies with the distance with the plates of the capacitor .",
    "we computed exactly this field in a series of lattices ( both regular as the simple cube and some realizations of barabasi - albert network ) starting from a completely reciprocal case and deleting randomly some of the connections .",
    "generally , provided that the proportion of reciprocal links is above the percolation threshold for the lattice considered , the statistical behaviour of the directed laplacian is the same of the non - directed one ( see figure [ fig1b ] ) .",

    "( [ 8_ap ] ) is formally given by @xmath37 but for matrices of the size of the www ( @xmath38 nodes ) this solution can not be used since it would be impossible to invert the matrix .",

    "this expansion allows to invert only the diagonal matrix @xmath2 ( that can be done easily by taking the inverse of the elements on the diagonal ) . while the physical meaning is clear in this form , it is mathematically more convenient to simplify the expressions above by simplifying both the operator @xmath27 and @xmath2 by putting eq .",

    "<S> the world wide web is one of the most important communication systems we use in our everyday life . despite its central role , </S>",
    "<S> the growth and the development of the www is not controlled by any central authority . </S>",
    "<S> this situation has created a huge ensemble of connections whose complexity can be fruitfully described and quantified by network theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one important application to sort out the information present in these connections is given by the pagerank alghorithm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> computation of this quantity is usually made iteratively with a large use of computational time . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that the pagerank can be expressed in terms of a wave function obeying a schrdinger - like equation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the topological disorder given by the unbalance of outgoing and ingoing links between pages , induces wave function and potential structuring . this allows to directly localize the pages with the largest score . through this new representation </S>",
    "<S> we can now compute the pagerank without iterative techniques . for most of the cases of interest </S>",
    "<S> our method is faster than the original one . </S>",
    "<S> our results also clarify the role of topology in the diffusion of information within complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> the whole approach opens the possibility to novel techniques inspired by quantum physics for the analysis of the www properties .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the work in the field of complex networks has been related to the analysis of particular datasets and their modelling through suitably chosen statistical growth models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more recent approach of particular interest is the study of the physical processes taking place on a network and interacting with its topology  @xcite as , for example , the diffusion on a complex network . the large variability in the number of neighbours that characterises complex networks produces unexpected behaviour in the propagation of viruses and diseases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same topological randomness makes also unpredictable the behaviour of the pagerank  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this quantity ( firstly introduced by the google search engine founders ) measures the importance of a page in the entire system  @xcite ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present procedure to compute this quantity on a given graph is based on numerical iterations . </S>",
    "<S> the whole process corresponds to surf the www with a number of random surfers and to assign the pagerank of a page as the number of times it is crossed by a walker . </S>",
    "<S> just to avoid the presence of trapping states for these surfers , they are allowed to jump into a completely new page of the www ( with probability @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the damping factor @xmath1 has been intensively studied , since pagerank changes significantly when @xmath1 is modified  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the effectiveness of this ranking procedure is witnessed by the success of the search engine google . since the first investigations , various procedures and algorithms have been presented to determine the pagerank and its dynamical evolution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is fair to say that the study of pagerank constitutes a field of research on its own . </S>",
    "<S> actually the pagerank has also a strong impact in may web - related topics such as propagation of trust ( e.g. trustrank , propagation of trust and distrust ) , and smoothed classification of pages . </S>",
    "<S> + we present here a novel approach based on an analogy with quantum physics . in particular we show that it is possible to rearrange the terms of the pagerank equation in such a way as to obtain a schrdinger - like equation for a wave function . for a given page , </S>",
    "<S> the wave function is given by the pagerank divided by the out - degree ( i.e. , the number of outgoing links ) . </S>",
    "<S> through this new approach we recognize that the topology of the system , ( more precisely the difference between the number of ingoing and outgoing links per page ) , plays the role of a local quantum - like potential @xmath2 defined on every page . </S>",
    "<S> two basic assumptions underlie these results . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , in the schrdinger equation for the www the spatial derivatives in the laplacian operator are expressed in the discrete space of a graph @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we adopt a directed version of this operator to account for the real topological structure of the web ( see appendix for a discussion on this point ) . + while the first operator in the new equation can be considered a laplacian operator , the second operator @xmath2 plays the role of a local potential ( given by the out - degree of a page divided by the parameter @xmath1 minus the in - degree of the same page ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a crucial point , since through the use of this potential , we can distinguish between the case of complete reciprocity  @xcite between nodes and the directed case . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> we show that the wave function must be constant everywhere . when reciprocity is broken , we have that a non trivial pagerank distribution is attained . </S>",
    "<S> a final constant term is also present and it is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the total number of pages in the system . </S>",
    "<S> with respect to the standard schrdinger equation , this constant term describe the behaviour of a source . </S>",
    "<S> every page creates a minimum quantity of pagerank that accumulates in most linked ( successful ) pages . even before considering the particular cases in which the equation can be analytically solved it is possible to understand the `` physical '' meaning of these various terms . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete laplacian directed operator accounts for the diffusive nature of the pagerank , and the potential accounts for the effects of the topology in the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> the constant term that vanishes when @xmath1 tends to @xmath5 has the form of a source of charge and it is related to the possibility that after a large jump , a walker can be originated in the page . in figure [ fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show the potential @xmath2 and the corresponding pagerank measured along concentric shells around an original vertex . </S>",
    "<S> +     top a pictorial representation of the page rank equation and its counterpart in term of wave function . </S>",
    "<S> bottom 3-d plot of potential @xmath2 and the corresponding pagerank measured along concentric shells around an original vertex.,width=302 ]    following this physical analogy , some limit situations can be immediately understood . </S>",
    "<S> consider the case in which the network is undirected , this means that the in - degree of every page is equal to the out - degree . </S>",
    "<S> no trapping states are present and we can therefore consider @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation becomes then a laplace equation whose solution is given by a constant wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we recover then the result that the pagerank in this case is proportional to the degree of the page . </S>",
    "<S> this clarifies the role of the potential : it is the disorder given by the absence of reciprocity in the links that creates the non trivial properties of the pagerank observed in the www . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 is different than @xmath7 and displays a minimum , ( as in the case of an electron wave function in a disordered medium ) the wave function is localized into the well of such a potential . in figure [ fig2 ] we show some examples of the topology of the potential in proximity of some hubs and the corresponding wave - functions ; the wave function is highly peaked in correspondence of the minima of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , those nodes that have a low pagerank tend to be located in proximity of the maximum of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that , since the web has not a simple topology , the fact that a page is minimum or a maximum of the potential is only evident when plotting the values at the nearest neighbours in the network . by exploiting the topology information in the potential @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> one is able to gain information about the pagerank spatial distribution . in particular , according to our picture , the higher scores of the pagerank will condensate within the potential wells . as a very first approximation one can consider pages corresponding to the smallest values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analysis on the a subset of the www ( the 2005 .eu domain  @xcite ) shows that by considering the @xmath8 minimal values of the potential @xmath2 one can guess ( irrespective of the order ) 61 among the top 100 values of pagerank . to improve this result ( without considering the general solution for @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> , one would have to take into account gradients and expansions around the local @xmath2 minima . </S>",
    "<S> actually our interpretation suggests a relatively simple way to compute the whole distribution of the pagerank ( independently from the physical interpretation of the directed laplacian operator ) . in principle </S>",
    "<S> once the matrices of the laplacian operator and the potential operator are known , the wave function ( and henceforth the set of pagerank values ) could be computed by inverting these operators . </S>",
    "<S> this simple operation is unfeasible when the size of the matrix is given by the tens of billions of pages composing the www . </S>",
    "<S> here instead we adopt a different approach based on matrix expansion that in principle could allow also to study the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this matrix expansion are plotted against the value of pagerank ( computed in the traditional way onto the same subset of the www cited above ) is shown in figure [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can increase as desired the order of the expansion with a computational cost that increases only linearly with the order ( see appendix for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> +     contour plot of potential and wave function for two opposite cases of attractive ( a , b ) and repulsive ( c , d ) potential . as before they are computed over concentric shells of neighbours computed through a bfs algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> in both cases the peak of the potential are produced by the topological disorder given by the difference between in - degree and out - degree of a node . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous line is obtained by averaging over nodes on the same shell . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    in conclusion , rearranging the terms in the pagerank equation , we have been able to obtain a schrdinger - like equation allowing us to define a site potential @xmath2 in the system . </S>",
    "<S> according to the meaning of the original equation , the pagerank ( now in the form of a wave function ) , localizes in the minima of this potential allowing educated guesses on the distribution of pagerank score . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this representation makes possible to compute the value of pagerank score through matrix expansion rather than iteratively . while in the limit of infinite pages </S>",
    "<S> the latter method is certainly less time consuming , for the subset of the www analysed here the expansion method is noticeably faster . since the pagerank is also used for a variety of web - related problems ( like for example the propagation of trust ) , in most of these cases where one deals with systems of medium - large size , our approach can be competitive . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the formal analogy with quantum physics makes available a complete series of theoretical frameworks like perturbation theory that could be used to study the dynamical evolution of the pagerank score distribution . while with iterative techniques we must compute anew the pagerank score distribution for any change of the topology , through our approach we can in principle obtain in a much shorter time the evolution of this quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger - like equation we introduce , formally generates a connection among completely different kind of phenomena and at very distant scales , like the world wide web and the microscopic world of quantum physics and it is likely to pave the way to a series of activities in this field .     a plot of the convergence of the expansion for the pagerank . </S>",
    "<S> on the x - axis we have the pagerank computed in the traditional iterative way , on the y - axis the pagerank computed through our proposed expansion . </S>",
    "<S> every vertex corresponds to a different page . increasing the order of the expansion the points condensate on the curve @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this process occurs very quickly for the top @xmath8 ranking sites of the www portion we studied.,width=302 ] </S>"
