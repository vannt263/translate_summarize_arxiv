    "the unique stability of the electromagnetic pulses emitted by radio pulsars could allow one to detect the presence of gravitational wave radiation .",
    "it is normally assumed that the pulsar , earth , and all points along the line - of - sight between the pulsar and the earth are located far enough away from the source that the space - time oscillations may be treated as gravitational plane waves @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that intermediate mass black hole binary systems may form in the centers of globular clusters ( gcs ) @xcite . given the high density of radio pulsars in gcs together with the relatively small scale length ( 100  pc ) of a gc , it is possible to find a pulsar whose line - of - sight will pass closer to the binary system than its end points .",
    "it is even possible that the pulsar itself may lie close to the binary system .",
    "it is shown in this letter that this scenario differs from the plane gravitational wave case in two important ways .",
    "first , the amplitude of the induced residuals depends on the distance of closest approach , or impact parameter , between the binary system and the earth - pulsar line - of - sight .",
    "second , since the closest distance may be well within one gravitational wavelength , the near - field terms will play the dominant role in inducing the observed pulsar pulse arrival time fluctuations .    in this letter ,",
    "the effect of the gravitational field of a binary system on pulsar timing residuals are calculated .",
    "this is the first time both near and far field terms are included in this calculation and no assumptions are made about the structure of the emitted gravitational wave front .",
    "the results are accurate to order @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the characteristic relative velocity of the mass - energy within the source , @xmath5 is the speed of light , @xmath6 is the length scale of the binary system , and @xmath7 is the smallest distance between the binary system and the earth - pulsar line of sight .",
    "the general expressions for the timing residuals derived here may be applied to pulsar timing data to constrain the properties of putative black hole binary systems .",
    "it should be noted that the 20 new millisecond pulsars recently discovered in the dense globular cluster terzan 5 @xcite may provide an interesting application of these results .",
    "the large number of pulsars together with this cluster s high central density ( @xmath8 ) make it a good candidate to detect or at least limit the existence of an intermediate mass binary black hole ( imbbh ) system in its core .    in the next section ,",
    "the general effect of a binary system on the arrival times of pulses emitted by a pulsar is calculated .",
    "we make use of geometric units where @xmath9 .",
    "order of magnitude estimates of the induced timing residuals are also made for astrophysically relevant systems .",

    "we choose the unperturbed four - velocities of both the emitter and the observer to be 1 in the time direction and zero for the three spatial components .",
    "to lowest order , the timing residuals are given by @xmath22 the last term on the right hand side is the standard doppler shift due to the relative velocity between the source and the emitter .",
    "the first two terms are determined by the actual path of the photons as they travel towards the receiver .",
    "the geodesic equations will be used to solve for both @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "to lowest order , these equations take the following form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the affine parameter along the light - ray path , @xmath25 is the proper time of the observer , and @xmath26 is the space - time metric .",
    "the metric is assumed to be of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the flat minkowsky metric and @xmath29 is a small perturbation given , at space - time location @xmath30 , by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the trace - reversed stress energy tensor of the region generating the space - time perturbation .",

    "next , the contribution due to the 4-velocity of the observer and emitter will be calculated .",
