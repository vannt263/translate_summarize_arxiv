    "the study of value distribution of entire functions dates back to picard , who proved that any non - constant entire function @xmath5 assumes all values in the complex plane with at most one possible exception @xcite .",
    "borel @xcite and blumenthal @xcite improved picard s result by showing that the number of solutions of the equation @xmath6 is asymptotically determined by the maximum modulus of @xmath5 in the disc @xmath7 for all @xmath8 with at most one exception .",
    "however , a real breakthrough in the study of value distribution of entire and meromorphic functions came from nevanlinna , whose second main theorem was a deep generalization of picard s theorem to meromorphic functions , and , in addition , a significant improvement to earlier known results on the value distribution of entire functions @xcite .",
    "since then , the phenomenon which picard discovered in the distribution of values of entire functions has appeared in various different contexts , including algebraic varieties , holomorphic maps of several complex variables , minimal surfaces , harmonic mappings , rigid analytic maps and difference operators .",
    "let @xmath9 , let @xmath1 be a meromorphic function , and denote @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes a multiset which takes into account multiplicities of its elements .",
    "it is said that the pre - image of @xmath12 is forward invariant with respect to the function @xmath13 if @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the hyper - order of @xmath1 is defined by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nevanlinna characteristic function .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite for the basic definitions and fundamental theorems of nevanlinna theory .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that certain type of regularity in the pre - image of a target value is as exceptional , for meromorphic functions having sufficiently small hyper - order of growth , as omitting the value completely .",
    "even if a meromorphic function assumes the value @xmath12 as frequently as the growth of the function allows , the value @xmath12 can be considered as `` exceptional '' if there exist @xmath17 with @xmath0 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , such that the pre - image of @xmath12 under @xmath1 is forward invariant with respect to a fixed branch of @xmath13 . by this definition the ( empty ) pre - image of the usual picard exceptional value is a special case of a forward invariant pre - image .",
    "the following theorem is , therefore , a generalization picard s theorem for meromorphic functions of sufficiently small hyper - order , and of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.7 ) where finite - order meromorphic functions were considered in the case when @xmath13 is a translation in the complex plane .",

    "it is easily seen that theorem  [ picard ] implies picard s theorem for meromorphic functions of hyper - order less than one .",
    "namely , assume that @xmath1 is a meromorphic function @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are distinct points in the extended complex plane , and @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath28 have forward invariant pre - images with respect to @xmath29 for any @xmath30 .",
    "therefore by theorem  [ picard ] it follows that @xmath1 is a periodic function with all periods @xmath30 , which is clearly only possible if @xmath1 is a constant .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to construct large classes of meromorphic functions having two distinct values with forward invariant pre - images for any fixed branch of an algebraic function @xmath13 . for",
    "if @xmath31 is the set of points which converge to infinity under iteration with respect to @xmath13 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are any finite disjoint subsets of @xmath31 such that the forward orbits of @xmath32 and @xmath33 under @xmath13 are disjoint and do not accumulate in @xmath34 , we may construct by using hadamard factorization theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.11 ) infinitely many finite - order meromorphic functions @xmath1 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 for any @xmath37 .",

    "if either the forward or backward orbits of @xmath13 in theorem  [ picard ] have an accumulation point in the complex plane , then the condition @xmath41 implies that the meromorphic function @xmath1 must , in fact , be a constant .",
    "this does not always happen , however .",
    "for example if @xmath13 is a translation @xmath42 , then clearly all periodic functions @xmath43 with the period @xmath44 satisfy @xmath45 .",
    "a simple example considered in @xcite shows that the growth condition @xmath21 in theorem  [ picard ] can not be deleted . by taking @xmath46 ,",
    "each of the @xmath47 roots of unity @xmath48 , @xmath49 , has a forward invariant pre - image with respect to the translation @xmath50 . since @xmath51 and",
    "the hyper - order of @xmath52 is one , a slightly weaker growth condition in theorem  [ picard ] in the case @xmath53 would allow a meromorphic function with arbitrarily many forward invariant pre - images for which the assertion of theorem  [ picard ] is not valid .",
