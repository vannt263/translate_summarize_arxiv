    "the distance dependence of the electrostatic force of coulomb s inverse square law has been tested in high precision through different methods , see for example the discussion of jackson@xcite and experiment of williams et al@xcite .    in this paper",

    "this is a kind of restoring electric self - force .",

    "for a particle with electric charge @xmath0 at rest at origin @xmath1 first , according to coulomb s law the distribution of its spherically symmetric electric intensity @xmath2 follows the inverse square law , that is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnitude of position vector from the particle to a field point .",
    "suppose this charge is shifted along @xmath5 axis by a displacement @xmath6 in a time interval @xmath7 and become stationary again at a position @xmath8 .",

    "this modification now not only modifies the electric intensity at position @xmath11 , but should also be down to the whole solid angle @xmath31 .",
    "thus we may write the electric intensity within the solid angle @xmath31 as @xmath32 then when the charge is subject to a temporary displacement @xmath6 during time interval @xmath33 , the electric intensities should be changed totally according to eq .",
