    "in recent years several attempts have been made to investigate the magnetic field vector distribution in the solar internetwork .",
    "initially , these works studied the magnetic field strength is in these regions .",
    "some favored magnetic fields of about a few hundred gauss or less ( asensio ramos et al .",
    "2007 ; lpez ariste et al . 2007",
    "; orozco surez et al .",
    "2007a , orozco surez & bellot rubio 2012 ) while others found magnetic fields in the kilo - gauss range ( domnguez cerdea et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; snchez almeida 2005 ) .",
    "these studies were carried out mostly with low spatial resolution data ( 1 `` ) .",
    "whenever the spatial resolution increased to better than 1 arcsec , this decreased the signal - to - noise ratio . with the hinode satellite ( kosugi et al .",
    "2007 ) it is now possible to obtain spectropolarimetric data ( full stokes vector ) with high spatial resolution ( 0.3 '' ) and low noise ( @xmath2 in units of the continuum intensity ) .",
    "thanks to these new data , it is now also possible to investigate not only the module but the three components of the magnetic field vector .",
    "this has led to a new controversy about the angular distribution of the magnetic field vector in the quiet sun . while some authors ( orozco surez et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ; lites et al . 2007 , 2008 ) found that the magnetic field is mostly horizontal ( @xmath3 ; with @xmath4 being the inclination of the magnetic field vector with respect to the observer s line - of - sight ) , others favor a quasi - isotropic distribution of magnetic fields ( martnez gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 ; asensio ramos 2009 ; stenflo 2010 ) . with a few exceptions ( harvey et al .",
    "2007 , lites et al . 2008 and",
    "martnez gonzlez et al . 2008 ) , all previous studies were carried out employing data recorded at disk center only .",
    "therefore , to better constrain the angular distribution of the magnetic field vector in the internetwork , we considered spectropolarimetric data recorded at different positions on the solar disk ( section  [ section : observations ] ) .",
    "+ in addition , asensio ramos ( 2009 ) , stenflo ( 2010 ) , and borrero & kobel ( 2011 ; hereafter referred to as paper i ) warned that the highly inclined magnetic fields obtained by some studies could be caused by the noise in the linear polarization profiles .",
    "this yields a distribution of @xmath5 ( component of the magnetic field vector that is perpendicular to the observer s line - of - sight ) with a peak at around 50 - 90 gauss . to avoid this problem",
    ", these authors proposed to include only those profiles in the analysis that have a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath6 in the linear polarization ( stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "although this selection criterion allows one to retrieve reliable distributions for the magnetic field vector , it has the disadvantage of excluding most of the stokes profiles within the field - of - view from the analysis ( see borrero & kobel 2012 ; hereafter referred to as paper ii ; cf .",
    "bellot rubio & orozco surez 2012 ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt an alternative approach based on inverting the histograms of the observed stokes vector ( section  [ section : pdftheory ] ) over the entire field - of - view instead of inverting the stokes vector at each pixel over the observed region . under a number of simplifying assumptions ,",
    "whose limitations are described in section  [ section : limitations ] , we were able to reach some important , albeit preliminary , conclusions about the angular distribution of the magnetic field vector in the solar internetwork and its variation across the solar disk ( section  [ section : conclu ] ) .",
    "the data employed in this work were recorded with the spectropolarimeter ( sp ; ichimoto et al .",
    "2008 ) attached to the solar optical telescope ( sot ; tsuneta et al .",
    "2008 , suematsu et al .",
    "2008 , shimuzu et al .",
    "2008 ) onboard the japanese spacecraft hinode ( kosugi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetric data comprise the full stokes vector @xmath9 around the pair of magnetically sensitive spectral lines 6301.5  ( @xmath10 ) and 6302.5  ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath12 refers to the effective land factor calculated under ls coupling .",
    "the spectral resolution of these observations is about 21.5 m per pixel , with 112 pixels in the spectral direction .",
    "the spatial resolution of hinode / sp observations is 0.32 \" . for this paper we selected three maps at three different heliocentric positions . in all three maps the spectrograph s slit",
    "was kept at the same location on the solar surface for the whole duration of the scan .",
    "this means that , while the vertical direction ( @xmath13-axis or direction along the slit ) contains information about different spatial structures on the solar surface , the horizontal direction ( @xmath14-axis or direction perpendicular to the spectrograph s slit ) samples the same position at different times .",
    "each spectrum was recorded with a 9.6 seconds exposure , yielding a noise of about @xmath15 in units of the quiet - sun continuum intensity .",
    "each map records data for a period of time ( @xmath16 hr ) that includes several turnovers of the granulation , thus breaking down the temporal coherence and providing spatial information ( in a statistical sense ) along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "+ in paper i we have demonstrated that photon noise plays an important role in determining the magnetic field vector from spectropolarimetric observations . to further decrease the level of noise in our observations we averaged every seven slit positions ( temporal average of about 67.1 seconds ) , which yields a new noise level of about @xmath17 ( in units of the quiet - sun continuum intensity ) .",
    "however , averaging means that the original map is shortened by a factor of seven in the direction that is perpendicular to the slit ( @xmath14-axis ) .",
    "this decreases the number of points available for statistics .",
    "fortunately , hinode / sp data have a sufficient number of pixels to ensure good statistics even after averaging ( see section [ section : conclu ] ) . in the following",
    "we briefly describe each map individually .",
    "this map was recorded on february 27 , 2007 between 00:20 ut and 02:20 ut .",

    "the center of slit was located at approximately the following coordinates on the solar surface : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this corresponds to a heliocentric position of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the heliocentric angle ) and to a latitude of @xmath22 .",
    "the noise level is @xmath23 .",
    "this map ( original and temporally averaged ) corresponds to maps b and c in paper i , and it was also employed ( with and without temporal averaging ) by lites et al .",

    "( 2007a ) .",
    "this map was recorded on february 6 , 2007 between 11:33 ut and 15:51 ut .",

    "the center of slit was located at approximately the following coordinates on the solar surface : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to a heliocentric position of @xmath26 and to a latitude of @xmath27 .",
    "the noise in this map is very similar to that in map b : @xmath28 .",
    "+      this map was recorded on january 17 , 2007 between 07:05 ut and 09:58 ut .",
    "it originally consists of 1048 slits positions , of which 149 remain after temporally averaging .",
    "the center of slit was located at approximately the following coordinates on the solar surface : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this corresponds to a heliocentric position of @xmath26 and to a latitude of @xmath31 . here , the noise level is slightly higher than in map a : @xmath32 .",
    "we note that some consecutive slit positions in this map show very high noise in the stokes profiles .",
    "although we could not relate this effect to the south atlantic anomaly ( increased flux of cosmic rays at certain orbits of the satellite ) we have removed these slit positions from our analysis , which reduced the effective number of slit positions to 120 . +     from the inversion of map a ( sect .  [ subsection : mapa ] ) .",

    "the maps in these figures are obtained from the inversion of the original data ( i.e. not temporally averaged ) .",
    "this avoids pixelization in the @xmath14-axis of these plots .",
    "however , for the remainder of the paper , our discussions and figures are based only on the temporally averaged ( 67.1 seconds ) data .",
    "+ although these previous figures only show the total magnetic flux density , it is worth mentioning that the vfisv code also retrieves the three components of magnetic field vector @xmath36 : @xmath37 is the module of @xmath36 , @xmath4 is the inclination of @xmath36 with respect to the observer s line - of - sight , and @xmath38 is the azimuth of @xmath36 in the plane that is perpendicular to the observer s line - of - sight . in addition , vfisv retrieves the magnetic filling factor @xmath39 as well as the line - of - sight component of the velocity vector @xmath40 and a set of thermodynamic parameters @xmath41 .",
    "we note that the magnetic flux density is defined as @xmath42 . for a more detailed overview on milne - eddington inversion codes , which include not only the magnetic field vector but also the thermodynamic and kinematic parameters relevant to the line formation",
    ", we refer the reader to del toro iniesta ( 2003 ) , borrero et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and references therein .",
    "the inversions carried out in the previous section could be employed to obtain histograms of the magnetic flux density @xmath35 , module of the magnetic field vector @xmath37 , and the inclination of the magnetic field vector with respect to the observer s line - of - sight ( @xmath4 ) at different positions on the solar disk .",
    "however , in this paper we aimed to infer properties about the distribution of the magnetic field vector by directly studying the histograms of the stokes profiles .",
    "figure  [ figure : stokhistogram]a presents distribution histograms of the maximum signals of the stokes @xmath43 ( dashed lines ) and stokes @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( solid lines ) normalized to the average quiet - sun intensity over the entire map : @xmath46 .",

    "the colors and the line - styles are as in figure  [ figure : stokhistogram]a . for instance : 31.6 % of the pixels in map a posses signals in @xmath7 or @xmath8 ( solid - red line ) that are above 4.5 times the noise level",
    ". to limit our analysis to the internetwork regions , we excluded from these figures the pixels in maps a , b , and c with a magnetic flux density @xmath48 mx @xmath49 . +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the previous subsections we have focused on the effect that the probability distribution function of the magnetic field vector @xmath50 has on the observed histograms of the stokes profiles at different positions on the solar disk . in our theoretical analysis a number of simplifying assumptions were made to keep the problem tractable .",
    "although they have already been pointed out in section  [ section : pdftheory ] , we summarize them here to briefly discuss their implications .",
    "+    * we have assumed that the thermodynamic and magnetic parameters are statistically independent of each other .",
    "this allowed us to write the total probability distribution function in eq .",
    "[ equation : pdftot ] as the product of two distinct probability distribution functions .",
    "however , as dictated by the lorentz - force term in the momentum equation in magnetohydrodynamics , the magnetic field affects the thermodynamic structure of the solar atmosphere .",
    "it is therefore clear that this assumption does not fully hold in the solar atmosphere .",
    "for instance , if we take the commonly accepted picture of intergranular lanes harboring more vertical and stronger magnetic fields than the granular cells , and we consider that intergranular cells have a smoother variation of the temperature with optical depth ( see i.e. fig .  3 in borrero & bellot rubio 2002 ) , we could then have postulated a correlation between the magnetic field vector @xmath36 and the gradient of the source function with optical depth @xmath51 , which is contained in @xmath41 ( eq .  [ equation : x ] ) .",
    "indeed , the higher @xmath51 is , the stronger will be the polarization profiles @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath33 ( see eq .  9.45 in del toro iniesta 2003 ) .",
    "these correlations could potentially cause the observed histograms of the stokes profiles ( figure  [ figure : stokhistogram ] ) to vary with the heliocentric angle , even if the underlying distribution of the magnetic field vector does not depend on @xmath21 .",
    "therefore it is important to investigate what an effect they have before conclusively proving that the distribution of the magnetic field vector is not isotropic ( sect .",
    "[ subsection : iso ] ) , or that the differences in the observed histograms of the stokes profiles are not due to the viewing angle ( sect .  [",
    "subsection : triple ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the aforementioned correlations are not known for the solar internetwork simply because it is not clear how magnetic fields are distributed here . in the future",
    "we will explore this question by employing 3d numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere , because they provide correlations between @xmath36 and @xmath41 that are compatible with the mhd equations .",
    "+ * we have also assumed that the probability distribution function of the thermodynamic and kinematic parameters , @xmath52 , does not depend on the position on the solar disk .",
    "kinematic parameters ( i.e. line - of - sight velocity @xmath40 ) do not influence our study , since they have no effect on the amplitude of the stokes profiles in fig .",
    "[ figure : stokhistogram ] .",
    "the same can be argued about other thermodynamic parameters in @xmath41 , such as the source function at the observer s @xmath53 ( affects only stokes @xmath54 ) , and damping parameter @xmath55 ( affects mostly the line width but not its amplitude ) . by far , the most important thermodynamic parameters affecting the amplitude of the stokes profiles under the milne - eddington approximation are the gradient of the source function with optical depth @xmath51 and the continuum - to - line - center absorption coefficient @xmath56 . in a 1d atmosphere both",
    "these parameters are known to decrease as @xmath21 increases , because the line - of - sight samples a thinner vertical - portion of the atmosphere . however , since the dependence of the polarization profiles with @xmath51 and @xmath56 are identical ( see eqs .",
    "8.14 , 8.15 and 9.44 in del toro iniesta 2003 ) , one would expect the same drop with increasing heliocentric angle angle in the amplitude of the circular polarization profiles ( stokes @xmath33 ) and linear polarization profiles ( stokes @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , figure  [ figure : stokhistogram ] shows that the linear and circular polarization profiles ( solid - color and dashed - color lines ) behave differently , and therefore we can rule out the variations of @xmath51 and/or @xmath56 with @xmath21 as being responsible for the observed histograms in the stokes profiles . of course , this would change in a 3d atmosphere , where the line - of - sight pierces through different inhomogeneous atmospheric layers , thereby opening the door for the possibility of @xmath51 and or @xmath56 to affect the linear and circular polarization profiles differently , instead of @xmath51 and @xmath56 . ] . + * adopting a milne - eddington atmosphere also implies that we are assuming that the magnetic field vector @xmath36 does not vary with optical depth @xmath57 in the photosphere .",
    "this can have important consequences , since at larger heliocentric angles the spectral line samples higher atmospheric layers than at disk center , where the probability distribution function of the magnetic field vector can be different .",
    "employing the widely used 1d holmu model ( holweger & mller 1974 ) we calculated that the continuum level @xmath58 rises by approximately @xmath59 km from disk center @xmath60 ( map a ; sect .",
    "[ subsection : mapa ] ) to @xmath61 ( maps b and c ; sects .  [",
    "subsection : mapb ] and [ subsection : mapc ] ) .",
    "since this vertical shift of the continuum level is rather small , we could argue that the histograms of the stokes profiles in fig .",
    "[ figure : stokhistogram ] are not affected by this effect .",
    "however , the value of 20 km should be considered only as a lower limit since a 1d model does not take into account the horizontal inhomogeneities present in the solar atmosphere . to properly account for this effect",
    ", more sophisticated 3d models should be employed .",
    "+ * finally , we have considered @xmath62 in our analysis ( see sect .",
    "[ section : pdftheory ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to considering that , at the resolution of the hinode / sp instrument ( 0.32 \" ; sect .",
    "[ section : observations ] ) , the magnetic structures are spatially resolved .",
    "this is , of course , highly unlikely , and therefore it would be important to drop this assumption in the future .",
    "its importance can only be quantified with additional assumptions about the scale - distribution of the magnetic structures in the solar photosphere .",
    "this topic is , in itself , as controversial as the distribution of the magnetic field strength and inclination , which is the reason why we have refrained from addressing it here .",
    "although employing 3d mhd simulations would certainly help to drop the @xmath62 assumption , we are cautious about it since it is not clear whether these simulations are reliable at the smallest physical scales ( snchez almeida 2006 ) .",
    "the histograms of the observed stokes profiles at different positions on the solar disk ( fig .",
    "[ figure : stokhistogram ] ) are clearly different from each other .",
    "one possible interpretation for this is that the distribution of the magnetic field vector in the solar internetwork is not isotropic .",
    "we explored this possibility in section  [ subsection : iso ] , where we employed an isotropic probability distribution of the magnetic field vector .",
    "this distribution yielded , as expected , the same distribution of stokes profiles at all positions on the solar disk ( fig .",
    "[ figure : isotropic ] ) .",
    "martnez gonzlez et al . (",
    "2008 ) have also presented similar histograms but employing the stokes profiles from the fe i line pair at 1.56 @xmath63 m ( observed with the tip2 instrument ; martnez pillet et al .",
    "their histograms ( see their figure 2 ) showed no clear variation with the heliocentric angle , which lead them to conclude that the distribution of the magnetic field vector in the quiet sun was isotropic .",
    "interestingly , these authors also mentioned after a more detailed analysis that there could indeed be a dependence of the histograms with the heliocentric angle ( as indeed we find here ) .",
    "+ in addition to martnez gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , a number of works have also argued in favor of an isotropic distribution of magnetic fields in the internetwork . in particular ,",
    "asensio ramos ( 2009 ) and stenflo ( 2010 ) , employing two different approaches , both concluded that for very weak magnetic fields ( @xmath64 ) the distribution becomes isotropic . with our present data",
    "we can not argue against or in favor of this interpretation .",
    "the main reason for this is that , as discussed in section  [ section : clvobs ] , any distribution for the magnetic field vector where @xmath5 has a peak below 40 - 70 will produce linear polarization profiles that are dominated by noise ( @xmath65-level or @xmath66 )",
    ". therefore our current approach ( described in section  [ section : pdftheory ] ) can not be employed to discern the underlying distribution of the magnetic field vector from these profiles dominated by noise .",
    "however , it can be employed to establish that the number of pixels that would follow this hypothetically isotropic distribution can not be much larger than 30 % of the pixels in the internetwork , since this is the amount of pixels that show a peak at the @xmath65-level in the polarization profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : stokhistogram]a ) . for signals above @xmath67 ,",
    "the histograms of the stokes profiles deviate significantly from the ones predicted by an isotropic distribution , and thus we can establish that here the distribution of the magnetic field vector can not be isotropic .",
    "+ we can use a different argument to further clarify the previous point .",
    "our theoretical distributions in section  [ section : pdftheory ] apply to all possible values of the module of the magnetic field vector .",
    "however , we could have employed distributions pieced together in the following form :      where @xmath69 could hypothetically correspond to an isotropic distribution for weak fields : @xmath70 .",
    "this would explain the @xmath65-peak in the linear polarization in figure  [ figure : stokhistogram]a ( dashed lines ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath71 could be a distribution , valid for larger fields @xmath72 , that would fit the tails of the histogram .",
    "the distribution given by equation  [ equation : piecepdf ] does not need to be discontinuous because it could be prescribed such that @xmath73 . + in section  [",
    "subsection : triple ] we employed a triple gaussian ( one for each component of the magnetic field vector ) distribution function and found that , under this assumption and at disk center , the best fit to the observed histograms of the stokes profiles is produced by a distribution in which the mean value of the magnetic field vector component that is parallel to the solar surface is lower than the mean value of the magnetic field vector component that is perpendicular to the solar surface : @xmath74 .",
    "this yields a distribution function where the magnetic field vector is highly inclined , in agreement with previous findings from orozco et al .",
    "( 2007a , 2007b ) and lites et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "however , this distribution does not fit well the histograms of the stokes profiles at other positions on the solar disk .",
    "in fact , in that section we found that it is not possible to fit the observed histograms for the stokes profiles at different heliocentric angles employing a theoretical distribution function for the magnetic field vector prescribed in the local reference frame that only changes due to the viewing angle @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for this is that , for an underlying distribution where the magnetic field vector is mostly horizontal at @xmath60 ( disk center ) , the amount of linear polarization slightly decreases when @xmath21 increases , while the amount of circular polarization would significantly increase as @xmath21 increases .",
    "however , the observed histograms of the stokes profiles ( fig .",
    "[ figure : stokhistogram ] ) show that , although the amount of linear polarization decreases when @xmath21 increases , the circular polarization does not particularly increase ( see also discussion in lites et al .",
    "this can not be explained in terms of a simple rotation of the viewing angle @xmath21 , and therefore we interpreted this fact , in section  [ subsection : other ] , as proof that the underlying ( i.e. in the local reference frame ) distribution of the magnetic field vector must depend on the position on the solar disk .",
    "+ under the assumption that the distribution of the underlying magnetic field vector depends on the latitude @xmath75 ( see sect .  [ subsection : other ] ) , we were able to find a theoretical distribution of the magnetic field vector ( eq .  [ equation : othercartesian ] ) that fits quite well the observed histograms of the stokes profiles at different positions on the solar disk ( figure  [ figure : other ] ) . among other properties ,",
    "this distribution features a magnetic field whose mean value decreases toward the poles . we note here that this does not mean that this is the real distribution for the magnetic field vector present in the quiet sun .",
    "one reason for this is that the fit is far from perfect ( see discrepancies mentioned in sect .",
    "[ subsection : other ] ) , but most importantly , that we do not know whether this solution is unique because there can be other theoretical distributions that fit the observed stokes profiles equally well , or even better .",
    "more work is indeed needed to confirm or rule out eq .",
    "[ equation : othercartesian ] as the real distribution of the magnetic field vector present in the sun .",
    "in particular , a better fit to the observed histograms of the stokes profiles is desirable .",
    "in addition , it is important to have maps at more latitudes to further constrain the possible distribution functions . + moreover , it is important to bear in mind that the conclusions above are not necessarily the only possible interpretations , because postulating a probability distribution function of the thermodynamic and kinematic parameters , @xmath52 , that varies with the heliocentric angle @xmath21 , or postulating a correlation between the thermodynamic ( @xmath41 ) and magnetic ( @xmath36 ) parameters might also help explain the observed differences between the histograms of the stokes profiles at different positions on the solar disk .",
    "another effect that has not been accounted for is that magnetic field vector can vary with optical depth in the solar photosphere . since the stokes profiles sample",
    "increasingly higher atmospheric layers as the heliocentric angle increases , the distribution of the magnetic field vector can be different for different values of @xmath21 , even if the probability distribution of the magnetic field vector is the same at all positions on the solar disk at a fixed geometrical depth .",
    "all these effects could be properly accounted for by means of 3d mhd simulations of the solar photosphere ( schssler & vgler 2008 ; steiner et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; danilovic et al .",
    "2010 ) . + in the future",
    "we expect to employ such simulations to either rule out or confirm our results in this paper .",
    "consequently , our conclusions at this point should be regarded as preliminary only . instead",
    ", the main purpose in this paper is to illustrate the methodology detailed in sections  [ section : clvobs ] and [ section : pdftheory ] to study the distribution of the magnetic field vector in the quiet sun , by directly inverting the histograms of the stokes profiles in entire maps instead of inverting the stokes profiles at each spatial position in a given map .",
    "our method has great potential to investigate several aspects of the photospheric magnetism in the solar internetwork .",
    "for instance , it can be used , as in sect .  [",
    "subsection : other ] , to confirm whether the mean value of the distribution of the magnetic field vector changes from disk center toward the poles ( cf .",
    "zwang 1987 ; ito et al .",
    "this will have important consequences for theoretical models that explain the torsional oscillations in the butterfly diagram in terms of a geostrophic flow model ( spruit 2003 ) , which requires a significant amount of magnetic flux at high latitudes at the beginning of the sunspot cycle .",
    "in addition , and although in this work we have restricted ourselves to variations in latitude ( @xmath75 ) , additional observations from disk center toward the solar limbs could be employed to investigate whether the properties of the magnetic field in the internetwork change also in longitude .",
    "this is already predicted by non - axisymmetric dynamo models ( moss 1991 , moss et al .",
    "1999 , bigazzi & ruzmaikin 2004 , charbonneau 2005 ) and can provide important clues about the strength of the differential rotation ( rdiger & elstner 1994 ; zhang et al .",

    "<S> recent investigations of the magnetic field vector properties in the solar internetwork have provided diverging results . while some works found that the internetwork is mostly pervaded by horizontal magnetic fields , other works argued in favor of an isotropic distribution of the magnetic field vector . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these seemingly contradictory results and by the fact that most of these works have employed spectropolarimetric data at disk center only , we have revisited this problem employing high - quality data ( noise level @xmath0 in units of the quiet - sun intensity ) at different latitudes recorded with the hinode / sp instrument . instead of applying traditional inversion codes of the radiative transfer equation to retrieve the magnetic field vector at each spatial point on the solar surface and studying the resulting distribution of the magnetic field vector , we surmised a theoretical distribution function of the magnetic field vector and used it to obtain the theoretical histograms of the stokes profiles . </S>",
    "<S> these histograms were then compared to the observed ones . </S>",
    "<S> any mismatch between them was ascribed to the theoretical distribution of the magnetic field vector , which was subsequently modified to produce a better fit to the observed histograms . with this method </S>",
    "<S> we find that stokes profiles with signals above @xmath1 ( in units of the continuum intensity ) can not be explained by an isotropic distribution of the magnetic field vector . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the differences between the histograms of the stokes profiles observed at different latitudes can not be explained in terms of line - of - sight effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , they can be explained by a distribution of the magnetic field vector that inherently varies with latitude . </S>",
    "<S> we note that these results are based on a series of assumptions that , although briefly discussed in this paper , need to be considered in more detail in the future . </S>"
