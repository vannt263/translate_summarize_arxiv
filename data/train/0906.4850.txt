    "recently the pierre auger collaboration reported a significant anisotropy in the arrival directions of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) @xcite . in their study ,",
    "the nearest neighbor of a given uhecr event is identified among the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) listed in the 12th edition of veron - cetty ( vc ) catalog @xcite .",
    "the maximum correlation was observed for 20 events out of total 27 events with energy above @xmath0 eev , when the closest agn is searched within the angular separation of @xmath1 among 442 agns with redshift @xmath2 ( corresponding to the distance @xmath3 mpc for @xmath4 ) .",
    "their study demonstrated a potential association of uhecr events with the sky position of nearby agns .",
    "however , the statistical significance of this correlation analysis may not yet be robust , since the number of detected events at extremely high energy is still rather small .",
    "but at least it implies that the sources of uhecrs might be correlated with the matter distribution in the local universe .    in the correlation analysis ,",
    "a priori knowledge of the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) is essential as it guides the propagation of uhecrs through the intergalactic space .",
    "even with considerable observational efforts , the nature of the igmf is still poorly known , especially in the low - density regions like filaments , sheets and voids , where activities are relatively weak . in ryu",
    "et al . ( 2008 ) @xcite , we suggested that a part of the gravitational energy is transferred to the magnetic field energy as a result of the turbulent dynamo amplification of weak seed fields in the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "this model predicts that @xmath5 % of the intergalactic space is magnetized with the field strength @xmath6 ng , and that the igmf follows largely the matter distribution in the cosmic web .    adopting this igmf model , we estimated that only @xmath7 % of uhe protons above 60 eev may arrive within 5@xmath8 of their sources located inside the gzk sphere with radius of 100 mpc @xcite .",
    "considering that the mean deflection angle of super - gzk protons caused by the igmf in our model is @xmath9 @xcite , it is natural to expect that , in the correlation study of the auger uhecr events , a significant fraction of the identified source candidates within 3.2@xmath8 may not be the true sources of the uhecrs . in order to explore how the distribution of source candidates and the igmf in the local universe influence the correlation analysis of uhecrs",

    "observers were placed in the regions corresponding to groups of galaxies with the halo temperature similar to that of our local group . for each uhe proton event above 60 eev , we computed two angular distances : _ separation angle _ and _ deflection angle_. the separation angle , @xmath12 , is the angular distance between the arrival direction of a given event and the position of the nearest agn among 500 source candidates .",
    "the deflection angle , @xmath13 , is the angular distance between the arrival direction of a given event and its true source position .",

    "we note that the mean separation angle @xmath18 shows a u - shape distribution ( see the discussion below ) .",

    "the filled circles connected with dotted line represent the mean values of @xmath12 ( same as those in figure 1 ) , while the filled circles connected with solid line refer to the median values of @xmath12 for the simulated events . for a given distance bin , @xmath19 $ ]",

    "the particles come from distant sources associated with different filaments",
    ". some of uhecrs may fly through voids and arrive with small @xmath15 , while most are deflected significantly by the igmf .",
    "the u - shape distribution of @xmath29 with minimum at @xmath30 mpc , as well as the u - shape distribution of @xmath18 in figure 1 , are the consequence of the bi - modal pattern , and a clear signature of the magnetized lss of the universe .    ) as functions of distance ( @xmath15 ) of true sources .",

    "the solid vertical lines with marks connect the first and third quartiles in the given @xmath15 bin.,width=307 ]    the mean deflection angle of all the simulated events is @xmath32 = @xmath33 , which is @xmath34 times larger than @xmath35 .",
    "one might wonder if deflection angles of this magnitude could erase the anisotropy in the arrival directions of uhecrs , which is observed in the auger data .",
    "however , the large deflection angle does not necessarily lead to the general isotropy of uhecr arrival directions , since the igmf distribution is also correlated with the lss .",
    "suppose uhecrs are ejected from sources inside the local supercluster .",
    "some of them will fly along the supergalactic plane and arrive at earth with relatively small @xmath13 .",
    "some of them may be deflected into void regions , but they may not get reflected back to the direction toward us due to lack of the turbulent igmf there . in this scenario ,",
    "the irregularities in the igmf serve as the ` scatters ' of uhecrs .",
    "so we will observe fewer uhecrs from void regions where both sources and scatters are underpopulated .",
    "consequently , the anisotropic behavior in arrival directions could be maintained even for the large values of @xmath29 , substantially larger than that of @xmath18 , if both source locations and the igmf distribution are anisotropic in the local universe .",
    "in order to test the validity of our models for the distributions of the igmf and nearby agns , we compare the distribution of @xmath12 obtained from our simulation with that of the auger data . in figure ,",
    "4 we show the cumulative fraction of events , @xmath36 , for the auger data ( open circles ) and the simulation data ( solid line ) .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test yields the maximum difference of @xmath37 between the two distributions , so the significance level of @xmath38 .",
    "it means that we can not reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions are statistically identical .    .",

    ", we calculate the fraction of true identification , @xmath40 , as the ratio of the number of events for which nearest objects are in fact true sources to the total number of simulated events .",
    "this is a measure of the probability to find the true sources of uhe protons in our model , when the nearest candidates are chosen blindly ( which is the best we can do with observed data ) . in figure 5 , we show the fraction as function of separation angle , @xmath12 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the fraction is @xmath42 % . as separation angle increases ,",
    "the fraction decreases gradually to @xmath43 % , indicating lower probability to find the true sources at larger separation angles . on average , in only 1 out of @xmath34 cases , the true sources of uhe protons can be identified , if we assume that our model for the igmf is valid .",
    "in the search for the sources of uhecrs , understanding the propagation of charged particles through the magnetized lss of the universe is important , if uhecrs originate from extragalactic sources . at present , the details of the igmf is still uncertain , mainly due to the limited available information from observation . in this contribution",
    ", we adopted a realistic model universe that was described by a cosmological structure formation simulation @xcite .",
    "our simulated universe represents a characteristic volume of the cosmic web , in which the distribution of the igmf was calculated by a physical model based on turbulent dynamo .",
    "hypothetical sources of uhe protons were placed at the deepest gravitational potential wells along the lss , and observers were placed at groups of galaxies like our local group .",
    "we then followed the propagation of uhe protons above 60 eev ejected from the hypothetical sources within a sphere of radius 75 mpc with observers at the center , in the simulated model universe @xcite .",
    "we calculated two angular distances for a given uhe proton event : the separation angle @xmath12 from its nearest source candidate and the deflection angle @xmath13 from it true source .",
    "the distribution of @xmath12 depends on the relative sky distributions of uhecr events and source candidates .",
    "we find the mean value of @xmath12 for simulated events is @xmath44 , while @xmath45 for the 27 auger events ( @xmath46 , if the event with @xmath47 is excluded ) . on the other hand , the distribution of @xmath13 is greatly affected by the igmf in the lss .",
    "the mean value is @xmath48 for the simulated events .",
    "( for the 27 auger events , of course , there is no way to estimate the true deflection angles .",
    ")    we tested whether the distributions of separation angle , @xmath12 , for simulated events and the 27 auger events are identical .",
    "the significance level that the two distributions are drawn from the identical population is @xmath38 , according the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "thus , we argue that our simulation results are in a fair agreement with the auger data .",
    "we point that , although the mean deflection angle @xmath32 is large , the arrival directions of uhecrs would still carry the anisotropy signature of our local universe , since the igmf is also correlated with the matter distribution in the lss .",
    "the fact that @xmath49 implies that some of the identified source candidates may not be the true sources , if we assume that our model of the igmf is correct .",
    "we estimate the probability of true identification as the ratio of the number of true source identification to the total number of simulated events .",
    "this probability is @xmath42 % at @xmath41 , but only @xmath50 % for @xmath51 and decreases to @xmath43 % at larger separation angle .",
    "this suggests that identifying the sources of uhecrs from positional correlation analysis may not be straightforward .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath18 and @xmath29 show u - shape distributions , resulting from the bimodal pattern in which @xmath13 is on average larger for either nearby sources ( @xmath52 mpc ) or distant sources ( @xmath53 mpc ) with its minimum at the intermediate distance , @xmath54 mpc .",
    "this is a characteristic imprint of the structured igmf to the deflection angle distribution .",
    "we suggest that the imprint can be tested with the distribution of @xmath12 , when enough observed uhecr events are accumulated ."
