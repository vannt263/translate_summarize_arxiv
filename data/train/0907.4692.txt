    "in 1997 , with the first results from central pb+pb collisions at the top - sps energy of 158  @xmath0gev beam energy coming in , na49 @xcite proposed an energy scan in order to search for signs for an onset of deconfinement for which early predictions have been made @xcite . after a sps test in 1998 ,",
    "pb - ions at 4 different beam energies below the top energy were provided by the cern - sps : 5 weeks of 40 @xmath0gev beam energy ( 1999 ) , 5 days of 80 @xmath0gev beam energy ( 2000 ) , and 7 days each of 20 @xmath0gev and 30 @xmath0gev beam energy ( 2002 ) .",
    "table [ sps_exp ] lists these beam energies , the participating sps experiments and their main observables for which the energy dependence was studied .",
    "na45/ ceres , na49 and na57 were the main participants ; na50 and na60 basically concentrated on the highest energy .",
    ".overview on participation of the sps - experiments at different beam energies and their main observables studied in dependence on energy .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ future ] lists all future experimental programs which are planned in order to address these questions and search for the structures in the qcd phase diagram ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "all listed experiments will be able to investigate hadron production including multi - strange hyperons , fluctuations and correlations in more detail than has been done so far .",
    "rare probes such as di - leptons and charm production will only become accessible at fair where sufficiently high beam intensities of up to @xmath1 ions / s will be provided .    in the rhic beam energy scan the star and phenix experiments will concentrate on the evolution of medium properties which have been measured in great detail at the top rhic energies . a good signature to look for",
    "is e.g.  the  turn - off of established effects such as the quark - number scaling of identified particle elliptic flow or the suppression of hadrons with high @xmath2 .",
    "the critical point and a first order phase transition will be searched for in fluctuations for which in particular the star detector with its large tpc is well suited .",
    "the successor of na49 , the na61/shine experiment at the sps will focus its search on event - by - event fluctuations , to be measured systematically with different energies and system sizes in order to find the critical point .",
    "the mpd detector at the new accelerator project nica at dubna plans to systematically study multi - strange hyperons and flow .",
    "the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) experiment at fair will measure hadron and lepton production in p+p , p+a and a+a collisions from ( 8 - 35 ) @xmath0gev beam energy ( au ions , up to 45 @xmath0gev for ions with @xmath3 ) ; the upgraded hades detector will cover the range from ( 2 - 8 )  @xmath0gev beam energy .",
    "main objectives of cbm are the search for signatures of a phase transition and the critical point by a careful scan of the excitation functions of hadron production , correlations , and fluctuations including rare probes such as charm production and di - leptons .",
    "the aim is to also quantify the properties of the created media , to establish the equation of state at high baryon densities and to search for the onset of chiral symmetry restoration .    due to the high availability of the beam ( order of 10 weeks integrated beam time per year ) and beam intensities up to @xmath1 ions / s systematic investigations with high statistics",
    "are foreseen . for the physics prospects of cbm the following 3 cases for a usage of 10 weeks au - beam at 25 @xmath0gev beam energy may serve as an illustration :",
    "minimum bias au+au collisions at 25 @xmath0gev beam energy without trigger can be recorded with 25 khz interaction rate .",
    "this yields basically  unlimited  statistics of bulk observables ( order of @xmath4 kaons and @xmath5 ) , low - mass di - electrons with high statistics ( @xmath6 @xmath7- , @xmath8- , and @xmath9-mesons each ) , and multistrange hyperons with high statistics ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "this will allow for the measurement of yields , spectra , flow , correlations and fluctuations in order to study the scaling behaviour of flow , the equation of state or strangeness equilibrium .",
    "if an open charm trigger is used , cbm will run with 100  khz interaction rate which allows to collect on the order of @xmath12 open charm hadrons . with a charmonium trigger ,",
    "the maximum fair beam intensities will be used and interaction rates of 10  mhz allow to collect on the order of @xmath13 j/@xmath14 .",
    "yields , spectra and first flow measurements of charm production can be performed with these statistics .",
    "measuring both , open charm and charmonium production allows to study the propagation of produced charm quarks in the dense medium and address the question whether their behaviour is more quark or ( pre-)hadron like .    -mesons ( left , @xmath15 decay channel , @xmath1 events ) and low - mass di - electrons ( right , different sources from left to right are @xmath16- , @xmath17- , @xmath8-dalitz , @xmath7- , @xmath8- , @xmath9-meson , 200k events ) in central au+au collisions at 25 @xmath0gev .",

    "background events are taken from urqmd @xcite , signal multiplicities from hsd @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to meet the experimental challenge the cbm detector is designed for hadron and lepton identification , and for high precision tracking and secondary vertex resolution @xcite .",
    "right behind the target and inside a large dipole magnet radiation hard and fast silicon pixel and strip detectors will be placed .",
    "detectors for particle identification will follow downstream .",
    "two different setups will allow for either electron or muon identification .",
    "the detector development is in process and detailed feasibility studies investigate the expected performance and help to optimize the setup .",
    "two examples of key observables for cbm are shown in figure [ cbm_figs ] .",
    "the sps low - energy program has been a very successful endeavour : strong evidence has been found for the onset of deconfinement at 30 @xmath0gev beam energy .",
    "this conclusion is based on a variety of measurements showing distinct changes in the energy dependence of yields , spectra and correlations of the emitted particles at this energy .",
    "modifications in the particle emission due to the initial phase are clearly seen in di - lepton spectra and particle production at high @xmath2 .",
    "however the data do not allow for a more quantitative characterization of the created media .",
    "obviously , the sps experiments investigated a very interesting region of the qcd phase diagram in which also structures such as a first order phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter and the critical endpoint are predicted .",
    "future investigations with modern , 2nd generation experiments are therefore planned in order to find these structures and characterize the created strongly interacting matter . in this context",
    "the planned cbm experiment at fair is of special interest as it will allow to access also rare probes such as charm production at threshold and di - leptons due to the high intensity beams provided by fair .",
    "the systematic , high statistics and high precision investigations of all these upcoming experiments will hopefully finally characterize the intermediate range of the qcd phase diagram within the next 10 - 20 years .",
