    "dual supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are @xmath4 kpc separation smbh pairs that are created by galaxy mergers .",
    "the dual stage lasts for @xmath5 myr @xcite , until tidal forces drag the smbhs into sub - pc separation binary smbh orbits that are expected to culminate in the coalescence of the two smbhs .",
    "the galaxy merger itself may funnel gas onto one or both of the dual smbhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , causing them to be observable as offset active galactic nuclei ( agns ; @xcite ) or dual agns @xcite , respectively .    dual agns and offset agns are uniquely well suited to studies of the link between agn activity and galaxy mergers , as they are actively accreting smbhs in the midst of mergers . for example , agns can be triggered by major mergers of galaxies , secular processes including accretion from galactic halos , and cosmological accretion along filaments ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the relative roles of these triggering mechanisms may depend on agn properties .",
    "galaxy merger simulations have predicted that major mergers preferentially trigger the most luminous agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the observational evidence for this is still conflicted because of the difficulty in building a clean sample of agns in mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dual and offset agns enable new and robust observational determinations of these sorts of connections between agns and galaxy mergers .",
    "although searches have turned up many dual agn candidates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there are still relatively few confirmed cases of dual agns .",
    "the observational challenge lies in confirming dual agn systems , which requires spatial resolution of the two individual agns .",

    "galaxy mergers drive excess gas onto the agns that increase their @xmath2luminosities , and mergers also induce higher nuclear gas columns that suppress the hard x - ray luminosities of the agns .",
    "galaxy merger simulations have shown that major mergers are capable of triggering dual agns with double - peaked emission line signatures such as those observed in our sample @xcite .",
    "more generally , observations of agn pairs have found that the agn fraction is highest for major mergers @xcite .",
    "if we use the stellar bulge luminosity ratio as a proxy for the galaxy mass ratio , we find that four of our six dual and offset agn systems are in agreement with this picture and are major mergers with mass ratios of 1:1 to 3:1 .    the dual agn system sdss j1126 +",
    "2944 is in an extremely minor merger with a mass ratio of 460:1 .",
    "our discovery of dual agns in a minor merger is in tension with theoretical expectations for dual agns .",
    "a phenomenological model of dual agns argues that minor mergers are unlikely to produce dual agns with double - peaked emission lines that have a comparable luminosity in each peak , which are the types of line profiles typically selected in spectroscopic searches .",
    "there has been one simulation of a minor merger , a 10:1 spiral - spiral merger @xcite in which the time period of dual agn activity was shorter than for major mergers @xcite .",
    "the enhanced tidal stripping and ram pressure on the less massive galaxy limited the time frame for efficient accretion onto its central smbh .",
    "minor mergers need to be explored in more detail by simulations to place sdss j1126 + 2944 in the broader context of how and how often such minor mergers produce dual agns .",
    "we also note that sdss j1126 + 2944 may have begun as a major merger , with extreme tidal stripping leading to the 460:1 mass ratio we presently observe .",
    "studies of galaxy pairs with separations @xmath334 kpc have found that the agn fraction is enhanced relative to field galaxies and that this enhancement is strongest for major mergers and for the more massive galaxy in the merger @xcite .",
    "other observations of galaxy pairs find that @xmath2luminosities are higher in the less massive galaxy in a pair @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological model of dual agns finds that @xmath335 of the simulated dual agns have the brighter agn in the smaller stellar bulge @xcite , while galaxy merger simulations also find that which agn is brighter changes with time as the merger progresses @xcite .",
    "for the dual agn system , we find that the more luminous agn is hosted in the more luminous stellar bulge ( figure  [ fig : merger_ratio ] ) .",
    "the dual / offset agns are a mixed bag , with three systems that have the higher @xmath2luminosity in the less luminous stellar bulge , one system that has the higher @xmath2luminosity in the more luminous stellar bulge , and one system that has equal @xmath2luminosities in both stellar bulges .",
    "we also examine the relative accretion rates of the two agns in the dual agn system , where we denote the more luminous stellar bulge with  1 \" and the less luminous stellar bulge with  2 \" . if we combine the eddington ratio @xmath336 and the eddington luminosity @xmath337 ( where @xmath338 is the mass of a proton and @xmath339 is the thomson cross section for scattering )",
    ", then we find that @xmath340 .",
    "if we assume that the black hole mass traces the host stellar bulge luminosity @xcite , such that @xmath341 , then @xmath342    with this approach , we find that the dual agn system has @xmath343 ( table  [ tbl-8 ] , figure  [ fig : merger_ratio ] ) and that the five dual / offset agns also have @xmath344 .",
    "our finding that every dual agn and dual / offset agn system has @xmath344 means that the agn in the less luminous stellar bulge is accreting at a higher eddington ratio than the agn in the more luminous stellar bulge .",
    "our result is in agreement with hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers , which find that the eddington rate is higher for the agn in the less massive of the two merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "other merger simulations have also produced situations where the less massive black hole accretes at a higher eddington fraction until the less massive galaxy s gas is lost to ram pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "the higher eddington rates in the less massive galaxies can be understood if the less massive galaxies have more gas available to them ( e.g. , higher gas fractions ) or if the gas accretion is more efficient in less massive galaxies ( e.g. , they experience stronger gravitational instabilities during mergers ) .",
    "while galaxy merger simulations have predicted that higher luminosity agns are more likely to be triggered in major galaxy mergers than lower luminosity agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the observational results have not converged .",
    "one study , which identifies mergers via visual morphology classifications , finds that the fraction of agns in mergers increases from @xmath345 to @xmath346 from agn bolometric luminosities of @xmath347 erg s@xmath21 to @xmath348 erg s@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "two other studies , which quantify mergers visually @xcite or by the asymmetry of the galaxies @xcite , find no correlation between major mergers and agn luminosity .",
    "the discrepancy in these results might be attributed to the known difficulties in making complete and accurate identifications of mergers with these observational approaches ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dual agns and offset agns present a solution to this observational problem , since they are by definition agns in galaxy mergers . here , we consider only the four dual / offset agns that are in major mergers ( section  [ major_mergers ] ) , and we compare them to the six likely single agns ( section  [ single ] ) .",
    "the existing host galaxy stellar mass measurements based on fits to the sdss photometry @xcite show that the mean stellar mass of the major mergers ( @xmath349=11.1 $ ] ) is similar to the mean stellar mass of the host galaxies of the single agns ( @xmath349=10.9 $ ] ) .",
    "we convert the agns @xmath2luminosities to bolometric luminosities @xcite , and we find that the four dual / offset agns have a mean agn bolometric luminosity of @xmath350 erg s@xmath21 ( standard deviation @xmath350 erg s@xmath21 ) while the six single agns have a mean agn bolometric luminosity of @xmath351 erg s@xmath21 ( standard deviation @xmath352 erg s@xmath21 ) .",
    "the dual / offset agns in major mergers are a factor of 10 times more luminous , on average , than the single agns .",
    "if we assume that the six single agns are not in mergers , then this suggests that agns in major mergers ( the dual / offset agns in major mergers ) have higher luminosities , in agreement with the trend seen in simulations .",
    "however , so far this is only a hint , as a larger sample is needed to confirm the trend .",
    "since galaxy mergers are efficient at driving central gas inflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there is an expectation that the agn fraction will increase as the merger progresses and the supermassive black hole pairs in a merger reach smaller separations . in general , simulations have predicted that the agn fraction peaks at black hole pair separations @xmath4 kpc @xcite .    to date ,",
    "observational studies of merger - driven agn activity have focused either on @xmath353 kpc separation agn or quasar pairs ( e.g. , @xcite ) or single agns in galaxies with merger - like morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our sample of dual and offset agns has separations @xmath354 , which straddle these two regimes of pre - mergers and post - mergers .",
    "because of the small projected separations and line - of - sight velocities ( table  [ tbl-8 ] ) , the sample likely consists of merging systems and not flybys .",
    "the @xmath355 kpc separations between merging galaxies also enable us to measure the agn fraction to smaller separations than ever before .",
    "observations have shown that the agn fraction increases as the separation between two merging galaxies decreases from 100 kpc to 10 kpc @xcite , and our data hint that the trend continues for separations @xmath4 kpc .",
    "of the six merging galaxies in our sample , the smallest separation merger is the only confirmed dual agn system ( @xmath356 kpc ; sdss j1126 + 2944 ) and the second - smallest separation merger is a likely dual agn system ( @xmath357 kpc ; sdss j1356 + 1026 ; awaiting confirmation from upcoming _",
    "observations ) .",
    "this suggests that dual agn activation could indeed be more common for merging galaxies with smaller separations , and this trend could be confirmed with a larger sample of dual agns .",
    "we have presented _ chandra_/acis observations of 12 dual agn candidates , including _ hst_/wfc3 observations of 10 of them . these dual agn candidates were selected by double - peaked narrow agn emission lines in their sdss spectra ; two agn - fueled @xmath2emission components separated by @xmath268 in optical long - slit spectroscopy ; and an estimated @xmath87 kev flux ( estimated from the measured @xmath2flux ) for each agn of @xmath88 erg @xmath89 s@xmath21 .",
    "the optical spectra alone are insufficient to identify whether these candidates are dual agns , but the criteria above were set up to enable _ chandra _ detections of two x - ray sources corresponding to the two @xmath2emission components , which would confirm dual agns .",
    "we have discovered a dual agn system in sdss j1126 + 2944 . in this system , we detected two x - ray sources , at @xmath259 each ; the projected separation and orientation on the sky of the two x - ray sources match those of the two observed @xmath2emission components to within @xmath132 ; and the positions of the two x - ray sources match the positions of two stellar bulges observed in _",
    "hst_/f160w imaging , to within @xmath132 in astrometric accuracy .",
    "the projected spatial separation of the dual agns is 2.19 kpc .",
    "if the secondary agn is indeed associated with the faint secondary stellar bulge , then the merger ratio of the system is 460:1 .",
    "this suggests that the secondary source may be a dwarf galaxy hosting an intermediate mass black hole or the tidally - stripped remnant of a galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole .",
    "we find five systems that are either dual agns or offset agns : sdss j0841 + 0101 , sdss j0952 + 2552 , sdss j1239 + 5314 , sdss j1322 + 2631 , and sdss j1356 + 1026 .",
    "sdss j1356 + 1026 might be defined as dual agns , except that it has soft x - rays associated with an outflow that confound detection of the secondary agn .",
    "the other four dual / offset agn systems have two @xmath2emission components with the same spatial separation and orientation on the sky as two stellar bulges ( to within @xmath132 ) , and x - ray sources detected at @xmath272 in one stellar bulge but @xmath358 in the other stellar bulge .",
    "the projected spatial separations between the stellar bulges are @xmath359 ( kpc)@xmath360 .",
    "follow - up observations are needed to determine if each system hosts an agn in the second stellar bulge ( confirming dual agns ) or not ( confirming an offset agn ) .",
    "we find six systems that are likely single agns : sdss j0142@xmath240050 , sdss j0752 + 2736 , sdss j0854 + 5026 , sdss j1006 + 4647 , sdss j1448 + 1825 , and sdss j1604 + 5009 .",
    "we do not detect double x - ray sources or double stellar bulges associated with the double @xmath2emission components in these galaxies , and we conclude that the double - peaked narrow emission lines in these galaxies are the result of outflows , jets , or disk rotation .",
    "three of the galaxies show evidence for photoionized gas , via their soft x - ray spectra and low ratios of soft x - ray to @xmath2luminosities .",
    "one of these galaxies is either dual agns or an offset agn ( sdss j1356 + 1026 ) , and the other two are likely single agns ( sdss j0752 + 2736 and sdss j1448 + 1825 ) . in these systems , one or both of the observed x - ray and @xmath2emission sources could be produced by a photoionization region near a single agn .",
    "type 2 dual agns have 2 - 10 kev hard x - ray luminosities that are two times lower , on average and for fixed @xmath2luminosity , than for type 2 single agns .",
    "we interpret this as the likely consequence of dual agns residing in galaxy mergers , where the merger drives excess gas onto the agns that increase their @xmath2luminosities .",
    "the merger also acts to decrease the observed hard x - ray luminosities , since it produces high nuclear gas columns that absorb more x - ray flux ( which is produced in close proximity to the agn ) than @xmath2flux ( which is produced on the larger scales of the nlr ) .",
    "\\6 . using the ratio of the stellar bulge luminosities as a proxy for the merger mass ratio",
    ", we find that four of the six dual and dual / offset agn systems occur in major mergers with mass ratios of 3:1 to 1:1 .",
    "the dual agn system sdss j1126 + 2944 is in an extremely minor merger of mass ratio 460:1 , which does not fit the common theoretical expectation that dual agns are produced in major mergers .",
    "the dual agn and dual / offset systems are mixed in terms of whether the more luminous agn is hosted in the less or more luminous stellar bulge , which is consistent with predictions from simulations and phenomenological models . in all of the dual agn and dual / offset systems , the less luminous stellar",
    "bulge hosts the agn with the higher eddington ratio , which suggests that the less massive galaxies in mergers have higher gas fractions and/or more efficient gas accretion .",
    "the dual / offset agns in major mergers have bolometric luminosities that are 10 times higher , on average , than those of the six single agns in our sample .",
    "if we assume that the six single agns are not in major mergers , then this result hints that agns in major mergers are more luminous than those that are not .",
    "however , a larger sample size is required to confirm this result .",
    "the probability of dual agn activation may increase as the separation between two merging galaxies decreases from @xmath361 kpc to @xmath362 kpc .",
    "the galaxy mergers in our sample have separations that range from 8 kpc to 2 kpc , and the smallest separation system is the confirmed dual agn system ( @xmath356 kpc ; sdss j1126 + 2944 ) , while the next - smallest separation system is likely to be a dual agn system ( @xmath357 kpc ; sdss j1356 + 1026 ) .",
    "again , a larger sample of dual agns is needed for confirmation of this trend .    our finding that dual agns have systematically lower hard x - ray luminosities than single agns underscores the need for deeper x - ray observations of dual agn candidates .",
    "when setting up this program , we relied on the @xmath2to hard x - ray scaling relation for single agns to estimate the _",
    "exposure times needed to make firm x - ray detections of the agns . in reality",
    "the dual agns have significantly lower hard x - ray luminosities than predicted by the relation for single agns , which is why many galaxies in our sample have too few x - ray counts to confirm or refute them as dual agns .",
    "the @xmath2to hard x - ray scaling relation for dual agns , which we establish here , will be invaluable for setting up future x - ray programs to confirm dual agns .",
