    "liquid argon ( lar ) is known to be an excellent target material for various particle physics experiments , such as neutrino physics , nucleon decay , and direct search for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp dark matter ) . for wimp search , use of its ionization and scintillation signals in addition to scintillation pulse shape discrimination",
    "provides a strong rejection power between the electron - recoil ( main background ) and the nuclear - recoil ( wimp signal ) events .",
    "on the other hand the scintillation light of lar , particularly for the purpose of particle physics experiment , is difficult to detect with normal photo - sensors since it is required for such photo - sensors to have the abilities of :    * detecting 128 nm vuv photon of lar scintillation light ; * operational under lar temperature at @xmath4186 @xmath5c ; * operational with relatively low voltage to avoid discharge in pure argon ; * counting one photo - electron for tiny physics signals and powerful background rejection .    due to these technical requirements ,",
    "the conventional procedure to detect lar scintillation light so far is to convert the 128 nm light to visible light ( 420 nm ) using tetraphenyl butadiene ( tpb ) as a wavelength shifter and those converted photons are detected by cryogenic photo - multiplier tubes ( pmt ) . + as a part of the ankok project  @xcite , a direct dark matter search experiment using double phase ar detector technique , we are under development of a new procedure to detect the lar scintillation light using multi - pixel photon counters ( mppcs ) .",
    "normal mppcs have high efficiency peaking at 400 to 500 nm and in general no sensitivity for vuv light ( here below 150 nm ) . for liquid xenon ( lxe )",
    "scintillation light ( wavelength of 175 nm ) , improved mppcs have been developed and are already in practical stage used by meg experiment  @xcite .",
    "a new mppc , further extended the sensitivity to below 150 nm , is currently under development by hamamatsu photonics k.k .",
    "@xcite and thus this kind of new mppc may be considered to open new style of liquid or gaseous argon scintillation detector in the near future .",
    "+ in this paper , basic properties of the newly improved mppc , its performance for detecting lar scintillation light , and its physics application are reported and discussed .",
    "the new mppcs , type number `` 3x3mm-50um vuv2 '' , `` 3x3mm-50um vuv3 '' and `` 3x3mm-100um vuv3 ''  @xcite , were developed for the direct detection of vuv light below 150 nm by hamamatsu photonics k.k . and tested at waseda university campus under cryogenic environment . `` vuv2 '' type was produced in april 2014 and their basic parameters are similar to commercially available mppc , type number `` s12572 - 33 - 050c ''  @xcite .",
    "`` vuv3 '' type , produced in april 2015 , is cross - talk suppressed model similar to type number `` s13360 - 3050cs ''  @xcite .",
    "the chip size is 3 mm @xmath6 3 mm , and the labels of `` -50um '' and `` -100um '' denote pixel size of 50 @xmath7 m and 100 @xmath7 m , respectively .",
    "basic parameters of these mppcs measured by hamamatsu photonics k.k . are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "these measurements are all done at room temperature of 25@xmath5c .",

    "since the charge distribution includes the effect of cross - talk and afterpulse , the following correction is necessary to evaluate the number of real photo - electron of the signal , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the correction factor defined as the total number of mppc pixel hits including real 1 photo - electron equivalent signal and hits due to cross - talk and afterpulse , @xmath13 by definition , @xmath12 is always greater than 1 by the effect of the cross - talk and its over voltage dependence is shown in left plot in fig .",
    "the plot is fitted into a function of sum of constant and exponential , and used for pde correction .",
    "for example , in the case of v2 - 50um-(2 ) , the number of photo - electrons at @xmath14 = 2.3 v with and without cross - talk correction are calculated to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the expected number of lar scintillation light at the surface of the mppc ( @xmath17 ) is estimated using following equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is energy of @xmath2am @xmath3-ray , @xmath20 is lar scintillation photon emission yield for @xmath3 particle  @xcite , and @xmath21 is acceptance calculated by solid angle from the @xmath2am source to the mppc .",
    "finally the photon detection efficiency is determined to be @xmath22 .",
    "the same procedure is repeatedly performed at different over voltage .",
    "right plot in fig .",
    "[ liq3 ] shows obtained pdes for three different types of mppcs as a function of the over voltage .",
    "the pde is @xmath238% for 50 @xmath7 m pixel mppcs , and @xmath2312% for a 100 @xmath7 m pixel mppc at @xmath24 v.    the basic properties of mppc in fig .",
    "[ prop1 ] ( gain and cross - talk ) are measured as a function of the over voltage at the liquid nitrogen temperature , while the @xmath3-ray data is obtained inside the liquid argon .",
    "since the the breakdown voltage shows relatively strong dependence on the temperature ( @xmath2350 mv/@xmath25c ) , the breakdown voltage at the liquid argon temperature needs to be determined independently .",
    "apparently the precision of the breakdown voltage determination ( @xmath26 v ) is one of the major source of the systematic uncertainty for the pde measurement .",
    "moreover for the v2 - 50um type , mppcs used to observe the lar scintillation ( v2 - 50um-(2 ) ) and to estimate the gain and cross - talk ( v2 - 50um-(1 ) ) are different individuals .",
    "this causes another major systematic uncertainty .",
    "relative uncertainty on the pde is assigned to be about 30% for vuv2 type , and 10@xmath2320% for vuv3 type shown as dotted line in the plot .",

    "a new type of the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) which has sensitivity for vuv light ( wavelength @xmath1 150 nm ) is recently produced by hamamatsu photonics k.k .. we have tested the new mppc under cryogenic temperature ( @xmath4190 @xmath5c ) and measured several basic properties . then we have successfully detected the scintillation light of lar ( wavelength = 128 nm ) with this mppc , and photon - detection efficiency is measured to be @xmath238% for 50 @xmath7 m pixel mppcs , and @xmath2312% for a 100 @xmath7 m pixel mppc at @xmath27 3 v.    for the recent wimp dark matter search experiments using liquefied noble gas ( argon and xenon ) , it is reported that the background events at the surface of the detector may be mis - reconstructed as events at center of the detector .",
    "those mis - reconstructed events remain in the signal region and limit the physics sensitivity . for the ankok experiment , we are considering to improve the spatial reconstruction resolution by arranging the mppc .",
    "for the double phase argon detector the spatial resolution in terms of electron drift direction is determined very precisely ( @xmath28(@xmath1 mm ) ) by the time difference between direct scintillation and secondary scintillation caused by the drifted electrons ( time projection ) .",
    "however the resolution in transverse plane is limited by the size of pmt ( typically 3 inches ) .",
    "locating the small size of mppc ( 3 mm@xmath63 mm ) at the detector wall in gas argon phase would potentially improve the spatial resolution to distinguish the background events from the wall since the vuv mppcs are expected to detect direct 128 nm scintillation light that contains more emission position information than wavelength shifted light by tpb .",
    "to conclude , this kind of new mppc may be considered to open new style of argon scintillation detector in the near future . thus further development toward practical stage including low - background technique",
    "is desired .",
    "we first acknowledge the solid state division of hamamatsu photonics k.k . for providing us with the new vuv mppc samples .",
