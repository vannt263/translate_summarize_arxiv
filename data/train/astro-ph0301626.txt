    "we frequently use the notation @xmath20 as a reminder that we have set @xmath21 .",
    "also , we will frequently be interested in the logarithms of physical quantities .",
    "our convention is to set @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath9 and @xmath11 are effective radii in @xmath24  kpc and velocity dispersions in km  s@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "in any given band , each galaxy in our sample is characterized by three numbers : its luminosity , @xmath8 , its size , @xmath9 , and its velocity dispersion , @xmath11 .",
    "correlations between these three observables are expected if early - type galaxies are in virial equilibrium , because @xmath26 if the size parameter @xmath27 which enters the virial theorem is linearly proportional to the observed effective radius of the light , @xmath9 , and if the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath11 is linearly proportional to @xmath28 , then this relates the observed velocity dispersion to the product of the observed surface brightness and effective radius .",
    "following djorgovski & davis ( 1987 ) , correlations involving all three variables are often called the fundamental plane ( fp ) . in what follows",
    ", we will show how the surface brightness , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 are correlated . because both @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath11 are distance independent quantities ( this assumes that cosmological dimming and k - corrections have been computed correctly ) , it is in these variables that studies of early - type galaxies are usually presented .",
    "the fundamental plane is defined by : @xmath30 where the coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are determined by minimizing the residuals from the plane .",
    "there are a number of ways in which this is usually done .",
    "let @xmath34 then summing @xmath35 over all @xmath36 galaxies and finding that set of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 for which the sum is minimized gives what is often called the direct fit , whereas minimizing the sum of @xmath37 instead gives the orthogonal fit .",
    "although the orthogonal fit is , perhaps , the more physically meaningful , the direct fit is of more interest if the fp is to be used as a distance indicator .",
    "a little algebra shows that the direct fit coefficients are @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be @xmath43 , @xmath9 or @xmath11 . for what follows",
    ", it is also convenient to define @xmath44 .",
    "the final expression above gives the scatter around the relation .",
    "if surface brightness and velocity dispersion are uncorrelated ( we will show below that , indeed , @xmath45 ) , then @xmath31 equals the slope of the relation between velocity dispersion and the mean size at fixed velocity dispersion , @xmath32 is the slope of the relation between surface - brightness and the mean size at fixed surface - brightness , and the rms scatter is @xmath46 . errors in the observables affect the measured @xmath47 , and thus will bias the determination of the best - fit coefficients and the intrinsic scatter around the fit . if @xmath48 is the rms error in the joint measurement of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then subtracting the appropriate @xmath51 from each @xmath47 before using them provides estimates of the error - corrected values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "expressions for the orthogonal fit coefficients can be derived similarly , although , because they require solving a cubic equation , they are lengthy , so we have not included them here .",
    "neither minimization procedure above accounts for the fact that the sample is magnitude - limited , and has a cut at small velocity dispersions .",
    "in addition , because our sample spans a wide range of redshifts , we must worry about effects which may be due to evolution .",
    "the magnitude limit means that we can not simply divide our sample up into small redshift ranges ( over which evolution is negligible ) , because a small redshift range probes only a limited range of luminosities , sizes and velocity dispersions . to account for all these effects",
    ", we use the maximum - likelihood approach ( e.g. saglia et al .",
    "2001 ) described in paper  ii .",
    "this method is the natural choice given that the joint distribution of @xmath52 , @xmath22 and @xmath53 is quite well described by a multivariate gaussian .",

    "if the population at high redshift is more luminous than that nearby , as expected if the evolution is passive , then the higher redshift population would have systematically smaller values of @xmath122 .",
    "since the higher redshift population makes up most of the large @xmath9 part of our sample , this could make the plane appear steeper , i.e. , it could cause the best - fit @xmath31 to be biased to a larger value .",

    "the small remaining difference between these and the maximum likelihood estimates is likely due to the fact that the likelihood analysis accounts more consistently for errors .",
    "figure  [ fig : fpgriz ] shows the fp in the four sdss bands .",
    "we have chosen to present the plane using the coefficients , obtained using the maximum - likelihood method , which minimize the scatter orthogonal to the plane .",
    "( in all cases , the evolution of the luminosities has been subtracted from the surface brightnesses . ) the results to follow regarding the shape of the fp , and estimates of how the mean properties of early - types depend on redshift and environment , are independent of which fits we use .",
    "a fair number of the galaxies in our sample have velocity dispersion measurements with small s / n ( see , e.g. , figure  19 of paper  i ) .",
    "the fp is relatively insensitive to these objects : removing objects with s / n @xmath126 15 had little effect on the best fit values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 . removing objects with small axis ratios",
    "also had little effect on the maximum likelihood coefficients .    in principle",
    ", the likelihood analysis provides an estimate of the error on each of the derived coefficients .",
    "however , this estimate assumes that the parametric gaussian form is indeed a good fit .",
    "although we present evidence in paper  ii that the gaussian form is indeed good , we emphasize that , when the data set is larger a non - parametric fit should be performed .",
    "therefore , we have estimated errors on the numbers quoted in table  [ fpcoeffs ] as follows . the large size of our sample allows us to construct many random subsamples , each of which is substantially larger than most of the samples available in the literature . estimating the elements of the covariance matrix presented in table  [ mlcov ] , and then transforming to get the fp coefficients in table  [ fpcoeffs ] , in each of these subsamples provides an estimate of how well we have determined @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "( note that the errors we find in this way are comparable to those sometimes quoted in the literature , even though each of the subsamples we generated is an order of magnitude larger than any sample available in the literature . ) because each subsample contains fewer galaxies than our full sample , this procedure is likely to provide an overestimate of the true formal error for our sample .",
    "however , the formal error does not account for the uncertainties in our k - corrections and velocity dispersion aperture corrections ( discussed in more detail in paper  i ) , so an overestimate is probably more realistic .    cccccc band & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & rms@xmath127 & rms@xmath128 +   +   +   +   +   + @xmath3 & 1.44@xmath90 & @xmath88 & @xmath129 & 0.056 & 0.100 + @xmath2 & 1.48@xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath130 & 0.052 & 0.094 +   +   +   + @xmath3 & 1.39@xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath131 & 0.056 & 0.100 + @xmath2 & 1.43@xmath90 & @xmath98 & @xmath132 & 0.052 & 0.093 +   +   +   +   +   + @xmath3 & 1.09@xmath107 & @xmath88 & @xmath133 & 0.061 & 0.091 + @xmath2 & 1.16@xmath107 & @xmath91 & @xmath134 & 0.056 & 0.088 +   +   +   + @xmath3 & 1.04@xmath90 & @xmath88 & @xmath135 & 0.061 & 0.090 + @xmath2 & 1.11@xmath107 & @xmath91 & @xmath136 & 0.056 & 0.087 +    [ simcoeffs ]    as a check on the relative roles of evolution and selection effects , we simulated complete and magnitude - limited samples ( with a velocity dispersion cut ) following the procedures outlined in appendix  a of paper  ii .",

    "=    =    given that the fp is not significantly warped , we would like to know if deviations from the plane correlate with any of the three physical parameters used to define it .",
    "when the plane is defined by minimizing with respect to @xmath178 , there is little if any correlation of the residuals with absolute magnitude , surface brightness , effective radius , axis - ratio , velocity dispersion , or color so we have chosen to not present them here .",
    "instead , figure  [ fig : fpresidr ] shows the result of plotting the residuals orthogonal to the plane when the plane is defined by the orthogonal fit .",
    "the residuals show no correlation with @xmath179 , @xmath122 , @xmath178 , or axis ratio ( we have subtracted the weak evolution in @xmath179 and @xmath122 when making the scatter plots ) .",
    "the residuals are anti - correlated with @xmath180 and slightly less anti - correlated with @xmath181 color .",
    "the correlation with color is due to the fact that velocity dispersion and color are tightly correlated ( this correlation is studied in more detail in paper  iv ) .",
    "the correlation with velocity dispersion is not a selection effect , nor is it associated with evolution ; we see a similar trend with velocity dispersion in both the complete and the magnitude - limited simulated catalogs .",
    "figure  [ fig : fpsigr ] shows why this happens .",
    "the four panels show the fp in four subsamples of the full @xmath2 sample , divided according to velocity dispersion .",

    "hence , the residuals with respect to the orthogonal fit show a correlation with velocity dispersion , whereas those from the direct fit do not .",
    "( indeed , by using the coefficients provided in tables  [ mlcov ] and  [ fpcoeffs ] , and the definition of the residuals @xmath84 and @xmath176 , one can show that @xmath182 is proportional to @xmath180 , with a constant of proportionality which is close to zero when the parameters for the direct fit are inserted .",
    "however , when the parameters for the orthogonal fit are used , then the slope of the @xmath183 versus @xmath180 relation is significantly different from zero . )    to illustrate , the solid curves in figure  [ fig : fpsigr ] ( the same in each panel ) show the maximum likelihood fp for the full sample .",
    "the dashed curves show the fp , determined by using the @xmath120method to minimize the residuals orthogonal to the plane , in various subsamples defined by velocity dispersion .",
    "the panels for larger velocity dispersions show steeper relations .",
    "evidence for a steepening of the relation with increasing velocity dispersion was seen by jrgensen et al .",
    "their sample was considerably smaller than ours , and so they ruled the trend they saw as only marginal .",
    "our much larger sample shows this trend clearly .",
    "we have already argued that this steepening is an artifact of the fact that lines of constant velocity dispersion are perpendicular to the @xmath184-axis .",
    "the maximum - likelihood fit to the subsamples is virtually the same as that for the full sample , provided we include the correct velocity dispersion cuts in the normalization of the likelihood . in other words , the maximum - likelihood fit is able to account for the bias introduced by making a cut in velocity dispersion as well as apparent magnitude .      the fundamental plane is sometimes used to infer how the mass - to - light ratio depends on different observed or physical parameters . for example , the scaling required by the virial theorem , @xmath185 , combined with the assumption that the mass - to - light ratio scales as @xmath186 yields a fundamental plane like relation of the form : @xmath187 the observed fundamental plane is @xmath188 .",

    "most of the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the shorter wavebands reported in the literature ( see , e.g. , table  [ fpcoeffslit ] ) are consistent with this scaling , whereas the higher values of @xmath31 found at longer wavelengths are not .",
    "although the direct fits to our sample have small values of @xmath31 , the orthogonal fits give high values in all four bands . these fits",
    "do not support the assumption that @xmath194 can be parametrized as a function of @xmath195 alone .",
    "=    another way to phrase this is to note that , when combined with the virial theorem requirement that @xmath196 , the fundamental plane relation @xmath197 yields @xmath198 ( e.g. jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 ; kelson et al .",
    "the quantity on the right hand side is the mass - to - light ratio ` predicted ' by the fundamental plane , if @xmath11 and @xmath9 are given , and the scatter in the fundamental plane is ignored .",

    ", a little algebra shows that mass to light ratio is determined by the combination @xmath200 .",
    "whether there is a simple physical reason for this is an open question .",

    "the scatter in the logarithm of this ratio is @xmath204 times the scatter in fundamental plane in the direction of @xmath9 ( i.e. , it is the scatter in the quantity we called @xmath84 in the previous subsections , divided by @xmath32 ) . inserting the values from table  [ fpcoeffs ]",
    "shows that if the values of @xmath11 and the effective radius in @xmath2 are used to predict the values of the mass - to - light ratio in @xmath2 , then the uncertainty in the predicted ratio is 26% .",

    "1996 ; kelson et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is somewhat confusing terminology , because the two mass - to - light ratios are not proportional to each other .",
    "this can be seen by using the maximum - likelihood results of table  [ mlcov ] to compute the mean of the observed mass to light ratio @xmath202 at fixed predicted @xmath205 , or simply by plotting the two quantities against one another .",
    "figure  [ fig : m2l ] shows how @xmath202 correlates with luminosity , mass @xmath206 , velocity dispersion , surface brightness , the ratio predicted by the fundamental plane , and color .",

    "these are shown as dashed lines in the top four panels .",
    "a linear fit to the scatter plot in the bottom left panel gives @xmath211 , with an rms scatter around the fit of 0.14 : the ratio predicted by the fundamental plane is not proportional to the observed ratio .",
    "a scatter plot of @xmath205 against all these quantities is tighter , of course ( recall the scatter around the fp has been removed ) , although some of the slopes are significantly different . for example , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 : the ` observed ' and ` predicted ' slopes of the mass - to - light ratio versus @xmath11 relations are very different .",
    "for this reason , one should be careful in interpretting what is meant by the ` predicted ' mass - to - light ratio .",
    "our own view is that the observed ratio , @xmath202 is to be preferred , as it is directly related to observables , and is independent of the fitting procedure used to fit the fundamental plane .",

    ", we conclude that the likelihood analysis of the evolution in luminosities is reasonably accurate ( @xmath216 ) in @xmath3 , but we note that this evolution is less than one would have infered if selection effects were ignored ( @xmath217 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) on the grounds that if the effective radius @xmath9 is a function of wavelength , then the ` mass ' becomes a function of wavelength , which is unphysical . on average ,",
    "the effective radii of the galaxies in our sample do increase with decreasing wavelength ( paper  i ) , so one might conclude that pahre et al.s objections are valid . however , recall that we do not use the measured velocity dispersion directly ; rather , @xmath11 represents the value the dispersion would have had at some fixed fraction of @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 depends on wavelength , and we wish to measure the velocity dispersion at a fixed fraction of @xmath9 , then one might argue that we should also correct the measured velocity dispersion differently in the different bands .",

    "so , if @xmath9 is larger in the blue band than the red , then the associated velocity dispersion we should use in the blue band should be smaller than in the red .",

    "when the sample is split by color , the redder galaxies appear to follow a tighter relation than the bluer galaxies , and they also tend to lie slightly closer to the zone of avoidance . we leave quantifying and interpreting these trends to future work .",
    "we have studied the fundamental plane populated by @xmath6 early - type galaxies over the redshift range @xmath241 in the @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands . if this fundamental plane is defined by minimizing the residuals orthogonal to it , then @xmath242 ( see table  [ fpcoeffs ] for the exact coefficients ) .",

    "this correlation with @xmath11 is simply a projection effect ( see figure  [ fig : fpsigr ] and related discussion ) , whereas the correlation with color is mainly due to the fact that color and @xmath11 are strongly correlated ( paper  iv ) .",

    "this thickness is sometimes expressed in terms of the accuracy to which the fp can provide redshift - independent distance estimates  this is about 20% . if the thickness is expressed as a scatter in the mass - to - light ratio at fixed size and velocity dispersion , then this scatter is about 30% .",

    "to do this , measurements of the velocity dispersion profiles of ( a subsample of ) the galaxies in our sample are required .",
