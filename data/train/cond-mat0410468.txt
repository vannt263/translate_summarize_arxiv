    "<S> this constraint is fulfilled both in the paramagnetic and in the ordered states ; in the latter case due to the averaging over all possible directions of the magnetization . using this approximation for @xmath40 from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> this deficiency can be made up by using results of exact diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we use the value @xmath63 derived for an infinite crystal from results of exact diagonalization [ 8 ] . if the assumption is made that for @xmath0 the system has the long - range antiferromagnetic order then the frequencies of spin excitations at * q * have to vanish . in this case one more unknown parameter  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ energies ] ) . the sublattice magnetization @xmath67 is directly connected with the condensation part : @xmath68 solving the mentioned set of equations for an infinite crystal we found that @xmath69 this result contradicts to the assumption of the long - range order for which @xmath64 has to be positive . </S>",
    "<S> we arrived at the conclusion that either there is no long - range order in the ground state of the 2d heisenberg model on the triangular lattice or the ordering parameter is too small to be determined by the present approximate method . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that the value of @xmath70 obtained in our calculations is in good agreement with the value @xmath71 derived from exact diagonalization [ 8 ] ( to our knowledge @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the only correlations with the values well - defined from exact diagonalization for the triangular lattice ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the manifestations of the short - range order is a finite frequency @xmath74 of spin excitations at the wave vectors * q*.    to consider the temperature variation of the spin correlations and spectrum we decreased the number of parameters , setting @xmath75 in this approximation we have four equations for four parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the range of temperatures @xmath76 and a @xmath77 lattice with periodic boundary conditions were used in these calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation @xmath78 is cruder than the previous one where @xmath79 and @xmath58 could differ . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the gap @xmath80 in the spectrum of spin excitations at the wave vectors * q * , the existence of which is an indication of the short - range order , is somewhat larger in the former approximation than in the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependencies of this gap , the spin correlation @xmath72 and the dispersion of the spin excitations in the approximation @xmath81 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1  3 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap @xmath74 grows with temperature which corresponds to the decrease of the correlation length .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , mori s projection operator technique was used for investigating the excitation spectrum of the two - dimensional heisenberg model on a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - temperature spin - excitation spectrum has gaps at the wave vectors @xmath82 , @xmath83 of the classical nel ordering which is an indication of the lack of the long - range antiferromagnetic ordering in the ground state of the system . </S>",
