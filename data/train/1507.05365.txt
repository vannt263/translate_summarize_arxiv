    "in broadband wireless communication systems , channel state information is required at the receiver for coherent signal detection since wireless channel distorts the received signals , especially when the wireless channel is dynamically changing .",
    "therefore , accurate channel estimation becomes a fundamental problem for broadband wireless communication systems over dynamic wireless channels @xcite .",
    "various linear channel estimation methods have been proposed in the literature @xcite , but their performance can hardly meet the simultaneously booming demand of high - rate and high - mobility wireless communications .",
    "recently , a lot of physical channel measurements have verified that wireless channels exhibit sparsity , i.e. , the dimension of a wireless channel may be large , but the number of channel taps with significant power is usually small , especially in broadband wireless communication systems @xcite . by exploiting this channel sparsity , compressive sensing ( cs ) algorithms have been used to improve the channel reconstruction performance , such as orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) @xcite , compressive sampling matching pursuit ( cosamp ) @xcite , subspace pursuit ( sp ) @xcite , etc . compared with conventional linear methods , cs - based channel reconstruction methods are able to achieve reliable channel estimation with reduced training resources @xcite .",
    "further studies have uncovered additional channel characteristics , e.g. , the temporal correlations of practical wireless channels : path delays change slowly over time , while path gains evolve faster @xcite . by taking these temporal channel correlations into account ,",
    "we have proposed several simultaneous cs - based methods to realize simultaneous reconstruction of sparse channels , such as adaptive simultaneous omp ( a - somp ) @xcite and structured sp ( ssp ) @xcite algorithms .",
    "different from the cs - based methods ignoring the temporal correlations of dynamic sparse channels but reconstructing the channel in each time slot independently , the simultaneous cs - based methods assume that dynamic channels in several consecutive time slots share the same path delay set to improve the channel estimation performance .",
    "however , the path delays of dynamic sparse channels may change over time , or even there maybe some mutations of the path delays , so the assumption of the simultaneous cs - based methods is not always true in practical broadband wireless communication systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a structured cs algorithm called structured matching pursuit ( smp ) for the reconstruction of dynamic sparse channels in broadband wireless communication systems . by exploiting the temporal correlations of a dynamic sparse channel @xcite",
    ", we divide the path delays of the dynamic sparse channel into two different parts to be considered separately , i.e. , the common channel taps and the dynamic channel taps .",
    "based on this separation , the proposed smp algorithm simultaneously detects the common channel taps of the dynamic sparse channel in all time slots at first .",
    "then the path delay set of the common channel taps is used as the initialization set in the dynamic channel taps tracking process , which aims to track the dynamic channel taps and remove the fake taps in the initialization set in each time slot .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the proposed smp algorithm based on the tool of restricted isometry property ( rip ) indicates that the common channel taps can be successfully detected with a high probability , and the reconstruction distortion of the dynamic sparse channel is linearly upper bounded by the noise power .",
    "numerical simulations show that the proposed smp algorithm with competitive computational complexity has better channel reconstruction performance than conventional reconstruction algorithms .",

    "benefitting from the common channel taps detection , the dynamic channel taps tracking process is able to approach the true path delay set @xmath7 rapidly , and this process will be terminated when the residue error signal @xmath55 is not reduced , i.e. , @xmath56 . finally , the dynamic sparse channel can be reconstructed based on the refined path delay set @xmath57 .",
    "the proposed smp algorithm is essentially different from the cs - based algorithms which ignore any temporal correlation of dynamic sparse channels @xcite-@xcite .",

    "to investigate the performance guarantee of the proposed smp algorithm , in this section , we first derive the condition of the successful detection of the common channel taps , and then analyze the condition of the successful tracking of the dynamic channel taps",

    "this greedy selection criterion can be formalized as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the correlation between the @xmath70-th basis of @xmath13 and the residue measurement @xmath71 in the @xmath20-th time slot .    in the first iteration , which means that the residue measurement @xmath67 equals to @xmath72 and the rough common path delay set",

    "specifically , the oracle - ls is regarded as the theoretical bound of the mse performance due to the fact that the path delay set is assumed to be perfectly known as a prior information .",
    "[ mse_snr ] investigates the mse performance comparison against snr for different reconstruction algorithms , where the temporal correlation degree is set as @xmath134 .",
    "it is evident that the standard omp algorithm and the sp algorithm outperform the linear method by about 2 db , where the benefit comes from utilizing the channel sparsity .",
