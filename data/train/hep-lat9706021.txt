    "wilson - yukawa models were extensively studied some years ago as a possible lattice formulation of chiral gauge theories @xcite . the idea was to decouple the lattice doublers from the light spectrum by introducing the so - called wilson - yukawa term , which contains a charged scalar field in a way that it is manifestly gauge invariant under a chiral gauge transformation . with the addition of this `` higgs '' particle",
    ", it was expected that doublers would decouple , while chiral fermions would remain in the light spectrum .",
    "this expectation was based on the numerical finding of a strong yukawa - coupling regime , both in the symmetric ( pms ) and broken ( fms ) phases , where the fermion masses are not proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field , as in the perturbative regime , and doublers can get masses of the order of the cutoff . however , for the same reason , also the light fermions are massive in this phase ( although their mass could be tuned to zero by tuning the bare mass ) .",
    "more problematic was the fact that the light fermions were found to have only vector - like couplings to the gauge fields .",
    "the physical picture that emerged from these results was that in the strong coupling phase , composites of the light fermions and the scalar particles were formed , generating effective mirror states and rendering the theory vector - like .",
    "this situation was found already in the quenched approximation .",
    "it is important to realize that the failure of wilson - yukawa models is also very relevant for all those lattice proposals of chiral gauge theories that explicitly break the gauge symmetry .",
    "the reason is that , once gauge invariance has been broken for a compact group , the gauge non - invariant theory is exactly equivalent to a gauge - invariant theory with new charged scalar degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the scalar degrees of freedom are nothing more than the pure gauge transformations .",
    "the effective action of these scalars differs in general from one proposal to another , but they are coupled as long as gauge invariance is broken in the original formulation and so they must be dealt with . in particular ,",
    "the simplest formulation of chiral gauge theories , which introduces a standard wilson term to decouple doublers , breaks gauge invariance and is in one - to - one correspondence to the wilson - yukawa models considered in @xcite .",
    "equivalently all proposals that break gauge invariance must have a corresponding wilson - yukawa picture .",
    "it is important to understand to what extent the failures of these models in providing a regularization for chiral gauge theories are circumvented by other proposals .",
    "recently a new method has been proposed to regulate chiral gauge theories on the lattice @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the fermions live on a lattice of spacing @xmath1 and are coupled to gauge link variables that are constructed by an appropriate smooth and gauge - invariant interpolation of gauge configurations @xcite that are generated on a coarser lattice of spacing @xmath2 .",
    "this construction corresponds to a two - cutoff lattice regulator ( tc ) , where fermion momenta are cut off at a much larger scale @xmath3 than the gauge boson momenta @xmath4 .",
    "doublers are decoupled by introducing a naive wilson term as in the roma approach @xcite . however , since the chirally breaking effects due to the wilson term are relevant only at scales of the order of the fermion cutoff , gauge boson momenta are not large enough to prove these interactions , in contrast with one - cutoff ( oc ) formulations . as a result , due to the separation of the cutoff scales ,",
    "no fine - tuning is necessary to recover an approximate chiral gauge symmetry , as long as the ratio @xmath5 is small enough . in other words ,",
    "gauge invariance is broken but there is a small parameter , @xmath5 , which controls the strength of this breaking .",
    "as we will see , there are good arguments to believe that a `` small '' breaking of gauge invariance does not have a dramatic effect at large distances @xcite .",
    "the two - cutoff construction is the first proposal that has a control over the strength of this breaking .    in this paper",
    "we want to consider the wilson - yukawa picture of the tc formulation of @xcite and show evidence that in fact a chiral phase exists , in contrast to what was found in oc formulations . in order to address these issues numerically ,",
    "we have considered the simplest relevant model , which is a @xmath6 compact theory in two dimensions , in the quenched approximation .",
    "the model contains one left - handed fermion coupled to @xmath6 gauge fields . in order",
    "to get rid of doublers , a right - handed fermion is introduced , which only couples through the wilson term . in the global limit ( @xmath7 , i.e.",
    "only the pure gauge transformations are coupled ) the wilson - yukawa picture is a scalar - fermion model with an exact global symmetry @xmath8 .",
    "this model has been previously considered in a standard oc formulation in @xcite , where it was found that the fermion spectrum was either doubled ( in the weak yukawa phase ) or vector - like ( in the strong yukawa phase ) .",
    "we will show that in the tc formulation a truly chiral phase exists .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the relation between gauge - non - invariant formulations of chiral gauge theories and models of the wilson - yukawa type . in section 3",
    ", we present the two - cutoff lattice formulation of the two - dimensional model under study and its equivalent wilson - yukawa picture . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the expected phases of this model and why a phase with massless chiral fermions should exist . in section 5",
    ", we present our numerical results on the fermion spectrum , which support the existence of a chiral phase . in section 6",
    "we briefly discuss the effects of unquenching and conclude in section 7 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , all proposals to regulate chiral gauge theories which break the gauge symmetry are equivalent to a model with an exact gauge invariance and additional charged scalars @xcite .",
    "this is simple to see .",

    "this is because @xmath24 and @xmath25 are invariant under this transformation .",
    "this theory is then a gauge theory with extra charged scalars in a non - linear realization ( @xmath17 is unitary ) .",
    "these scalars are the pure gauge transformations , which couple through the non - invariant terms in the original action .",
    "it is clear that in any successful proposal for regulating chiral gauge theories , these scalars must decouple from the light physical spectrum . in the case of a spontaneously broken gauge theory",
    "these degrees of freedom remain , since they become the longitudinal gauge bosons .",
    "this is however not our objective here , since we aim at regulating a symmetric chiral gauge theory .",
    "the interesting case of spontaneous symmetry breaking will be considered elsewhere .",
    "foester , nielsen and ninomiya ( fnn ) gave in @xcite a good argument why a gauge theory should be recovered at long distances in theories like ( [ ni ] ) , provided that the strength of the interactions in @xmath26 is `` small '' .",
    "their argument is quite simple .",
    "let us suppose that the characteristic coupling of the non - invariant terms is arbitrarily small at the cutoff scale .",
    "then in the gauge - invariant picture of the theory ( [ gi ] ) , this implies that the @xmath17 fields are very weakly coupled .",
    "consequently , the free energy will be maximized when the @xmath17 variables are decorrelated at distances of the order of the cutoff ( i.e. the lattice spacing ) or , in other words , these degrees of freedom are effectively very massive .",
    "then it makes sense to integrate them out in order to obtain an effective theory at low energies . at distances much larger than the cutoff , but still smaller than the correlation length of the gauge - invariant degrees of freedom , it can be argued that the effective action should be local ( after all it comes from the integration of heavy particles ) and exactly gauge - invariant ( it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ gi ] ) that if we perform the integration over @xmath17 what remains is an exactly gauge - invariant theory due to the exact symmetry ( [ gtg ] ) ) .",
    "in this situation , the only effect of the @xmath17 fields is a renormalization of the gauge - invariant coupling in @xmath20 .    the difficult part in realizing the fnn mechanism is to satisfy the requirement that the interactions of the @xmath17 fields are `` small '' .",
    "the typical situation is that the @xmath17 fields are coupled through a higher - dimensional operator , like a wilson term , which is suppressed by the fermion cutoff .",
    "however , an operator of this kind does not satisfy the requirement .",
    "this can be seen already at the perturbative level .",
    "although the wilson term is an irrelevant operator , which vanishes naively in the continuum limit , it appears in ultraviolet divergent loops , inducing corrections to the scalar action of @xmath27 at all orders .",
    "in contrast , if the boson cutoff ( @xmath17 and @xmath28 fields ) is much smaller than the fermion cutoff , it can be shown that the wilson term is really an irrelevant coupling at long distances , because the gauge breaking effects induced by loop corrections are suppressed by powers of the ratio of the boson cutoff to the fermion one , to all orders . for details on the power counting arguments specific to the lattice tc formulation , we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fnn conditions are then satisfied by the tc formulation if the ratio of these cutoffs is small enough , and we expect that the mechanism is realized and an effective gauge invariance is recovered at large distances .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , we presented a two - cutoff lattice construction of chiral gauge theories .",
    "a different proposal in the same direction was given in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using two - cutoffs as we have explained is precisely making the violations of gauge invariance small at large distances . with one cutoff a non - perturbative tunning of counterterms would be needed to achieve this @xcite .",
    "the way in which the cutoff separation is implemented is by the use of two lattices .",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom are the wilson link variables of an euclidean lattice of spacing @xmath2 , @xmath29 .",

    "a wilson term is included in the fermionic action .",
    "for each charged chiral fermion , a singlet of the opposite chirality is needed .",
    "the fermions are coupled to the gauge fields through a standard lattice gauge - fermion coupling on the @xmath1-lattice .",
    "the @xmath1-link variables are obtained through a careful interpolation of the real dynamical fields , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "as long as the interpolation is smooth , it is clear that the separation of scales is achieved in this construction , since the high momentum modes of the gauge fields are cut off at the scale @xmath35 , while the fermions can have momenta of @xmath36 .",

    "similarly , it is covariant under the remaining @xmath2-lattice symmetries ( @xmath46 rotations , translations , spatial and temporal inversions ) .",
    "this is important to ensure that lorentz symmetry is recovered in the continuum limit @xmath47 .",
    "finally , the interpolation has to be as smooth as possible in order to achieve the cutoff separation . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a sufficient condition to ensure that the gauge symmetry violations induced by the wilson term are suppressed by @xmath5 is that the interpolated field , in the limit @xmath48 , describes a differentiable continuum gauge field inside each @xmath2-lattice hypercube , and its transverse components are continuous across hypercube boundaries .",
    "we refer to this property as transverse continuity .",
    "now , we want to derive the equivalent wilson - yukawa picture . following the steps of the previous section and using the property ( [ gt ] ) ,",

    "the problem is much more difficult .",

    "obviously they have to be different from the ones appearing in the lagrangian ( [ u2 ] ) , since these have chiral quantum numbers .",
    "notice that according to fnn , this is in fact the only possibility : if the light fermions are massive at finite lattice spacing , they must be vector - like in order to satisfy gauge invariance .",

    "the existence of a strong yukawa phase implies that , even though the global chiral symmetry is not broken ( in 2d this has to be the case even in the sw phase according to mermin - wagner - coleman theorem ) , mass terms appear .",
    "the solution of this apparent contradiction is that the fundamental massive fermions are not the ones in the original lagrangian ( [ sca ] ) , but new fermionic composites made out of the original ones and the scalar fields , which are expected to form in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",

    "clearly the only difference between oc and tc is in the scalar dynamics . in the tc case",
    "we have set @xmath67 for simplicity , so we are deep in the vx phase . in oc studies",
    "the fermion spectrum has not been analysed in detail in this extreme region of phase space .",
    "probably one of the reasons is that it is much more demanding numerically .",
    "the other reason is that in the unquenched theory fermion loops introduce large ( typically @xmath27 ) corrections to @xmath87 , so that in the full theory it makes no sense to consider the case @xmath118 unless some fine - tuning is done . in the tc case , as we will see , fermion loops introduce only a small correction to @xmath87 , provided there are no gauge anomalies .    the main difference between the two formulations is the fact that , due to the interpolation , the high fourier modes of the scalar field are suppressed .",
    "let us consider a region of phase space with @xmath86 arbitrarily small and @xmath119 .",
    "we use @xmath38 units unless stated otherwise . according to the oc studies this would correspond to the strong phase , where the spectrum is vector - like .",
    "however , for these couplings , the light lattice mode ( i.e. @xmath120 ) is coupled to the scalar field only through a perturbatively small @xmath86 yukawa coupling , and a higher - dimensional operator . at small lattice momentum ,",
    "the effect of this operator is small .",
    "notice that this is true only for tc . in the oc case",
    ", the wilson term also induces a large @xmath121 coupling between the light mode and the doublers , so it is not possible to treat it in perturbation theory . in the tc case ,",
    "this coupling is small , because it involves high - momentum modes of the scalar field ( @xmath122 ) , which are suppressed . on the other hand , for the doubler poles , @xmath123 ,",
    "the wilson term is effectively a yukawa coupling of strength @xmath121 , in both oc and tc formulations . in this situation",
    ", we expect that at small enough @xmath86 , the light mode enters into a weak phase , because the strength of the yukawa couplings is small at @xmath120 , and there is no reason to believe that the formation of the mirror state is dynamically favoured . on the other hand",
    ", the doubler modes could remain in the strong phase , since for them the yukawa couplings are of @xmath27 .",
    "this of course would be a most desirable scenario , since the doublers would be decoupled from the light spectrum , while the light modes would remain massless without any extra tuning , in the same way as they are in the weak yukawa phase .",
    "in other words , the light fermion spectrum would be chiral and not doubled .",
    "for this reason we will refer to this phase as the chiral phase . clearly , the fact that the scalar field momenta can not get as large as the fermion cutoff ( the doubler momentum ) is essential in this argument .",
    "if a new phase of the kind discussed above exists at small @xmath86 , it can not be described by the lowest orders of the hopping parameter expansion and it is reasonable to expect that this expansion should signal its failure to converge at small @xmath86 .",
    "the first - order hopping result ( [ hop1 ] ) corresponds to the resummation of a set of one - loop tadpole diagrams , which is a geometric series in the quantity @xmath124 .",

    "this phase is clearly more difficult to analyse than both the strong and weak phases , since doublers and light modes behave in a very different way , even though they are excited by the same field . at large momenta",
    ", the hopping expansion is expected to be a good approximation , while at small momenta weak perturbation theory should be a good approximation . the exact result for the propagator of the physical fields in momentum space is then expected to be an interpolation between the hopping result ( [ hop1 ] ) at large momenta and the weak expansion result at small momenta .    at small momentum and to zeroth order in @xmath86 and @xmath85 : @xmath130 higher - order corrections can induce a renormalization of the fields so in general we expect that the propagators will be well reproduced by @xmath131    the @xmath132 components of @xmath133 are zero , because there is no chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however all the remaining components of the neutral and charged propagators , i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath135 are non - zero . in weak perturbation theory , they correspond to multiparticle states made of various combinations of the massless fields , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and the scalar @xmath50 .",
    "for instance , at large times , we expect that the propagation of @xmath138 and @xmath139 is dominated by two - particle states , i.e. @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the scalar propagator .",
    "since these propagators involve scalars , which have masses of the order of the boson cutoff , they should decouple from the light spectrum .    at large momentum ,",
    "a better approximation is provided by the strong coupling expansion . in this case",
    "the physical propagators @xmath142 and @xmath143 combine with the remaining neutral and charged components to form massive dirac fields .",
    "thus we do not expect light doubler poles .",
    "the physical propagators at large momentum should behave as @xmath144    to summarize , the expected phase diagram in the symmetric phase , in the tc formulation , has three regions ( not necessarily separated by phase boundaries ) . at small @xmath145 , there is a weak phase where all fermions are massless , doublers and light lattice modes .",
    "the effective theory in this regime is different from the target theory ( [ target ] ) in that there is a doubling : for each mode with a @xmath146 coupling to the gauge field , there is one with a @xmath147 coupling . at large @xmath148 , there is a strong phase where all fermions are massive , although chiral symmetry is not broken .",
    "the real asymptotic fermion state is a singlet fermion ( the charged one is possibly just a two - particle state , as favoured by the oc studies @xcite ) , which only couples to the gauge fields through higher - dimensional operators .",
    "this is also far from ( [ target ] ) .",
    "even if the charged fermion existed as a free fermion in this phase , it would couple vectorially to the gauge fields , so again the continuum effective theory would be different from the target theory .",
    "fortunately , there is a third region at @xmath104 , which was not present in oc models , where the doublers are decoupled from the light mode , but the latter is only weakly coupled to the scalar field and remains in the weak phase .",
    "this chiral phase is expected to give rise to the target theory defined by ( [ target ] ) .",
    "our main purpose in the following is to show clear evidence of the existence of this phase in the tc formulation .",
    "we have computed the fermion propagator for the different fields @xmath149 , @xmath97 and @xmath96 , by inverting the appropriate fermion matrices on configurations of the @xmath50 fields that were obtained by interpolating a set of completely random @xmath150 configurations , in the way described in the appendix .",
    "this corresponds of course to the case @xmath67 . for the fermion fields , we have used periodic boundary conditions in the spatial direction and antiperiodic in the temporal direction",

    "this is simply the number of conjugate - gradient iterations ( ncg ) needed in the propagator inversion for a fixed precision .",
    "the naive expectation is that the required number of iterations should increase as @xmath86 decreases , because the lowest eigenvalue of the fermion matrix decreases with @xmath86 .",
    "this changes however when we enter the chiral phase , since the light mode is massless and the lowest eigenvalue is fixed by the ir cutoff , which is the lowest lattice momentum ( remember we use ap boundary conditions in the time direction ) .",

    "for this reason it is expected that unquenching is not going to change the phase diagram of the fermion - scalar model in any important way . a way to quantify",
    "this is by looking at how the phase of the fermion determinant for the action ( [ u1 ] ) changes under a gauge transformation .",
    "the magnitude of this change is a measure of the strength of the couplings of the scalar fields @xmath50 , induced by the fermion loops . at this stage",

    "we have presented numerical evidence in favour of the existence of a truly chiral phase in a two - cutoff formulation of a quenched 2d wilson - yukawa model with a global @xmath8 .",
    "the yukawa phase diagram is different from the one found in the one - cutoff formulation of this model in that there is a new phase for @xmath198 and @xmath199 , where doublers are split from the light spectrum , which is composed of massless fermions with chiral quantum numbers .",
    "when one of the chiral symmetries is gauged , the continuum limit of this lattice model is expected to give rise to a chiral gauge theory .",
