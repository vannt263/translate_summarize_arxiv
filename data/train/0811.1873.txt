    "the field of ultracold two - component fermi gases with population imbalance is a very active area of research which in recent years has attracted a great deal of interest both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the experiments are carried out with clouds of atoms confined in harmonic traps and the analysis of the measured density profiles is a key diagnostic tool to investigate issues such as shell structures and the phase transition from a superfluid to a normal state of the gas .",
    "important achievements of this technique have been the observation of phase separation between a superfluid core and a normal external shell driven by the degree of polarization  @xcite , by the interaction strength tuned across a feshbach resonance  @xcite and by the temperature of the gas  @xcite .    in the unitary limit , corresponding to a diverging scattering length between the spin - up and spin - down components of the fermionic mixture , the density profiles of the polarized gas have been investigated in details in ref .",
    "this theoretical study is based on an accurate determination of the equation of state of the strongly - interacting normal gas as a function of imbalance obtained using quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "it provides predictions for the shape of the profiles , for the density jump at the boundary of the superfluid core and for the critical polarization when the system turns fully normal , which are in excellent agreement with the experimental findings of the mit group  @xcite . in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) limit of small and positive scattering lengths , the polarized gas is predicted to behave like a mixture of composite bosons ( the bound dimer molecules ) and fermions ( the unpaired atoms )  @xcite .",

    "the density profiles of a trapped polarized fermi gas have also been the object of theoretical investigations based on self - consistent approaches both at unitarity  @xcite and in the bec regime  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the uniform gas at zero temperature as a function of polarization and interaction strength has been calculated using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques in ref .",
    "this study provides a precise determination of the equation of state of four different phases competing for the ground state of the system : ( a ) the unpolarized and ( b ) polarized superfluid gas and ( c ) the fully and ( d ) partially polarized normal gas . the quantum phase transition from the normal to the superfluid state is first order and is accompanied by a region of phase separation where the two phases coexist in equilibrium . only in the deep bec regime , where the bose - fermi mixture model applies , the transition from a fully polarized fermi gas to a miscible mixture of few superfluid bosons in a fermi sea becomes second order .",
    "in this article we use the knowledge of the energy functionals of the uniform phases ( a)-(d ) as a function of polarization and interaction strength and using the local density approximation we calculate the phase diagram of a trapped gas and the density profiles of both spin components .",
