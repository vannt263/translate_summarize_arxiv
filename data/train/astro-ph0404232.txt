    "microlensing is rare and out - numbered by stellar variability by at least a factor of ten thousand . despite this ,",
    "the selection of microlensing candidates in variability surveys seems straightforward at an optimistic first glance . unlike almost all forms of stellar variability ,",
    "microlensing is achromatic , time - symmetric and does not repeat .",
    "the theoretical form of the microlensing lightcurve is well - known ( e.g. , paczyski 1986 ) and so events can seemingly be selected by their goodness - of - fit in two passbands .    in practice ,",
    "the selection of candidates is fraught with difficulties .",
    "the lightcurves are usually sparsely sampled and noisy  for example , the median seeing at the site of one of the most prominent microlensing experiment ( macho ) is @xmath0 .",
    "more awkwardly still , the clear - cut set of characteristics of microlensing only holds good in the simplest case of an isolated point - mass lensing a point - source .",
    "in fact , microlensing lightcurves may show colour variations because of blending ( e.g. , di stefano & esin 1995 ) .",
    "they may show substantial deviations from time - symmetry because of parallax or xallarap effects ( dominik 1998 ; mao et al .",
    "2002 ) or because the lens is a binary star ( e.g. , mao & paczyski 1991 ; an et al . 2004 ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the results of the microlensing experiments towards the magellanic clouds by the macho and eros collaborations remain controversial ( e.g. , evans 2002 ) . from 5.7 years of data",
    ", the macho collaboration identified between 13 and 17 candidates towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and reckoned that the optical depth is @xmath1 ( alcock et al .",
    "the first set of 13 events comprises the most convincing candidates , whilst the second set of 17 candidates includes an additional 4 events less firmly established .",
    "this is in astonishing contrast to the results reported by the eros collaboration , who found just 3 events towards the lmc ( lasserre et al .",
    "the two experiments are not directly comparable as eros monitor a wider solid angle of less crowded fields than do macho .",
    "even though eros do not analyze their data in terms of optical depth , it is clear that the results point to a lower value than that claimed by macho .",
    "tellingly , a similar discord prevails in the results towards the galactic centre ; macho ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) recorded that the microlensing optical depth to the red clump stars as @xmath2 , while eros ( afonso et al . 2003b ) found a value of @xmath3 at almost the same location .",
    "these discrepancies strongly suggest that the systematic effects in the experiments are not yet fully understood , with candidate selection fingered as the most likely culprit .",
    "all this motivated belokurov , evans & le du ( 2003 ) to introduce neural networks as an automatic way of classifying lightcurve shapes in massive variability surveys .",
    "they constructed a working neural network for identification of microlensing events and applied it to microlensing data towards the galactic centre . in this paper , the ideas and methods of analysis are extended to the variability datasets taken towards the lmc .",
    "this is a harder problem , as the source stars are fainter and hence the microlensing events less clear - cut .",
    "a particular difficulty already identified by alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is the contamination of samples of microlensing events by supernovae in distant galaxies behind the lmc .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "first , let us recall that alcock et al . ( 2000 ) used a series of conventional cuts to identify microlensing events .",
    "the set a selection criteria are `` designed to accept high quality microlensing candidates '' .",
    "the set b criteria are `` designed to accept any light curves with a significant unique peak and a fairly flat baseline '' .",
    "19 lighcurves pass the set a criteria and 29 pass the looser set b. sometimes the same source star has two lightcurve because , for example , it lies in an overlap region .",
    "eight of the 29 lightcurves ( 1a , 1b , 7a , 7b , 10a , 10b , 12a and 12b ) correspond to just four stars . finally , alcock et al .",
    "apply a supernova cut , insisting that a blended microlensing lightcurve is a better fit than a sn ia template .",
    "this finally leaves 13 events in set a ( events 1 , 4 - 8 , 13 - 15 , 18 , 21 , 23 and 25 ) and 17 events in set b ( everything in set a together with 9 , 20 , 22 and 27 ) .",
    "subsequently , event 22 was confirmed to be a seyfert galaxy and so can be removed from set b ( sutherland , private communication ) .",
    "= 17 cm    = 17 cm    table  [ table : macho ] shows the predictions of committees of neural networks for the lmc microlensing candidates selected by macho .",
    "first , let us concentrate on the output in the first two columns which is provided by the committee of neural networks to eliminate variable stars ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "let us recall that the output @xmath4 is the posterior probability of microlensing .    in total ,",
    "7 out of 13 candidates from macho set a receive @xmath5 in both red and blue filters : 1 , 5 , 6 , 14 , 21 , 23 , 25 .",
    "these events can be regarded as secure microlensing identifications .",
    "six events from macho set a fail the test for microlensing .",
    "event 18 is a marginal case , as it is identified in the red ( @xmath6 ) but not in the blue ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is a low signal - to - noise event , with one of the smallest maximum amplifications @xmath8 .",
    "events 4 , 7 , 8 , 13 and 15 have @xmath9 in both bands .",
    "some of these lightcurves are noisy with no stable baseline , such as events 13 and 15 .",
    "event 8 has an apparently asymmetric shape , partly because the beginning of the event is lacking due to a gap in the observational campaign .",
    "the lightcurves of some of the failed events are shown in figure  [ fig : lmcmiss ] .",
    "one of the lightcurves that was selected by macho as a result of applying only the loose selection criteria b gets an output @xmath10 .",
    "this is event 22 .",
    "the remaining three candidates ",
    "events 9 , 20 and 27  all fail our microlensing test of @xmath11 .",
    "the four supernova suspects as judged by macho ( events 16 , 17 , 19 , 26 ) fail the microlensing network committee .",
    "the other three candidates also suspected by macho of being supernova lightcurves , 10a , 11 and 24 , are classified with probability @xmath10 .",
    "they are , however , discarded after being tested with the second neural network committee .",
    "convincing supernova candidates must have an output @xmath12 from the second neural network committee .",
    "there are five events satisfying this , namely the 4 macho supernova suspects ( 11 , 12a , b , 17 , 19 ) plus candidate 20 .",
    "the colour evolution of event 11 is illustrated in figure  [ fig : lmc_color ] .",
    "although not identified by macho as a supernova candidate , event 20 has a typical supernova colour evolution .",
    "macho claims there are four more supernovae in the dataset , namely events 10a , b , 16 , 24 and 26 .",
    "unfortunately , candidate 16 has no information in the red filter , but it is classified as non - microlensing in the blue colour by the first network .",
    "event 24 has probability @xmath13 , the error is large and  to be conservative  we conclude its origin is unknown .",
    "candidates 10a , b and 26 have outputs greater than 0.8 .",
    "these two events have timescales of @xmath14 days .",
    "if they are indeed supernovae , it means that signal is present only for @xmath15 days after the maximum light .",
    "the colour reaches a maximum after @xmath16 days , but even after 20 days b - v can be as much as @xmath17 mag ( see figure 1 in phillips et al .",
    "neither event 10a , b nor 26 shows any significant colour change .",
    "hence , we do not confirm the supernova classification of alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "there is just one candidate that has a substantial colour signal identified as blended microlensing by the neural networks .",
    "this is event 5 .",
    "the colours evolve symmetrically during the event , which becomes @xmath18 mag bluer .",
    "it has output @xmath19 and is illustrated in figure  [ fig : lmc_color ] .",
    "in conclusion , then , the committees of neural networks reckons that there are 7 convincing microlensing candidates .",
    "these are the events 1 , 5 , 6 , 14 , 21 , 23 and 25 .",
    "all these events have an output that always lies above the decision boundary @xmath5 .",
    "they also judged to be not supernovae ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "of the remaining events , 10a and 18 are possible , but not convincing , microlensing candidates .",
    "compared to alcock et al.s ( 2000 ) set a , we have discarded events 4 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 15 and 18 ( which is a marginal case ) .",
    "four of the events that we have excised from alcock et al.s sample a are shown in figure  [ fig : lmcmiss ] . in each case",
    ", we show the data from the passband which yields the lowest network probability .",
    "none of the events in set b ( events 9 , 20 and 27 ) are identified as microlensing by the committee , while event 22 is known to be a seyfert on other grounds    alcock et al . reckoned there were 8 supernova suspects .",
    "we confirm 4 of these ( events 11 , 12 , 17 , 19 ) and we also found 1 new one ( event 20 ) .",
    "the remainder of alcock et al s supernova candidates are not thought to be either convincing supernova or microlensing candidates by the committees .",
    "how does this affect the optical depth results ?",
    "in qualitative terms , the optical depth must be significantly lower than the value of @xmath1 of alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and more in accord with the results of the eros collaboration ( laserre et al .",
    "this is because the number of convincing microlensing candidates has been reduced from 17 to 7 in our analysis .",
    "however , in quantitative terms , the optical depth is not so easy to compute without re - processing the entire macho dataset of @xmath21 million lightcurves .",
    "there may be lightcurves that the neural networks identify as microlensing , even though macho did not .",
    "this seems unlikely , as no new candidates emerged from the @xmath22 macho lightcurves we have re - processed .",
    "however , it can not yet be ruled out , and so we do not provide an estimate for the optical depth from our neural networks . here , we merely note that the number of events has been roughly halved , and we speculate that a concomitant reduction in the optical depth might be expected .",
    "this paper has demonstrated the power of machine learning techniques , such as neural networks , for the classification of events in massive variability datasets . using the specific example of the microlensing surveys , committees of neural networks",
    "have been devised to discriminate against common forms of stellar variability and against supernovae .",
    "the output of the neural network is the posterior probability of microlensing , given the prior distribution in the training set .",
    "the error on the probability can be straightforwardly calculated .",
    "the networks have been used to process some of the data ( @xmath23 lightcurves ) taken towards the large magellanic cloud by the macho collaboration ( alcock et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the latter authors provide a set of 13 events whose identification as microlensing is believed to be secure and a further 4 events whose identification is possible .",
    "the neural networks confirm the microlensing nature of only 7 of these possible 17 events .    without processing the entire dataset ( @xmath21 million lightcurves ) ,",
    "we can not be sure that there are no events missed by alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which would be classified as microlensing by the networks .",
    "it is reasonable to argue that this is unlikely , as the @xmath22 macho lightcurves we have re - processed provide no new candidates .",
    "but , this remains a plausible speculation rather than an empirically derived fact .",
    "hence , we can only speculate that , as the number of events has been roughly halved , so the optical depth will be similarly reduced .    for comparison , alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimate the optical depths of the thin disk , thick disk and spheroid to be @xmath24 , whilst the optical depth of the stellar content of the lmc to be @xmath25 on average . in other words , from the known stellar populations in the outer galaxy and the lmc , the optical depth must be at least @xmath26",
    ". this may well be enough to provide the 7 events whose microlensing nature we confirm .",
    "there is supporting evidence for the belief that the known stellar populations are providing the bulk of the lenses both from the exotic events and from the lensing signal towards the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "first , the exotic events yield additional information which can break some of the microlensing degeneracies and thus give indirect evidence on the location of the lens .",
    "there are two exotic events towards the lmc and two towards the smc ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ; palanque - delabrouille 1998 ; kerins & evans 1999 ; afonso et al .",
    "2000 ; alcock et al . 2001a ; evans 2002 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the exotic events favour an interpretation in which the lens lies in the magellanic clouds .",
    "additionally , alcock et al . (",
    "2001b ) imaged one of the events towards the lmc and identified the lens as a nearby low mass disk star .",
    "second , as afonso et al .",
    "( 2003a ) point out , the duration of the events towards the smc is very different from the duration towards the lmc .",
    "the eros collaboration constrain the optical depth towards the smc to be @xmath27 at better than the 90 % confidence level , based on an admittedly small sample .",
    "both these facts militate against the idea that a single population of objects in the milky way halo is causing the microlensing events . the mass function , internal kinematics and proper motions of the smc and lmc are different , so that differences in the distributions of microlensing events are expected if the lenses lie predominantly in the magellanic clouds . based on roughly spherical models of the dark halo , the optical depth towards the smc",
    "is expected to be greater than that towards the lmc if the halo provides most of the lenses .",
    "hence , the paucity of events towards the smc is beginning to be highly problematic for halo interpretations of the events .",

    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for a number of helpful comments . in this research , we have used , and acknowledge with thanks , data from aavso international database based on observations submitted to the aavso by variable star observers worldwide .",

    "it is interesting to develop methods of calculating the theoretical microlensing quantities directly from the outputs of neural networks .",
    "let us define @xmath28 to be the ratio of the density of microlensing events in the training set to the true density , i.e. , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the conditional probability of microlensing ( i.e. , class 1 ) in the real world .",
    "the output of the neural network is the posterior probability , and relies on the prior probabilities of different classes of variability in the training set .",
    "as follows from table  [ table : tset ] , the prior probability of microlensing in the training set is at least @xmath31 times larger than that in the real world .",
    "indeed , the training set contains a large number of microlensing lightcurves to ensure a good variety of training examples .",
    "therefore , the outputs of the trained neural network need to be adjusted with respect to the real - world priors .",
    "it has been shown ( e.g. , saerens et al .",
    "2002 ) that a simple iterative procedure can help to tackle the problem . for microlensing",
    ", it follows from bayes theorem that : @xmath32 for variable stars , the same equation holds good without the correction for input space sampling , namely @xmath33 this assumes that the sampling never causes the misclassification of a variable star as a microlensing event . in our notation",
    ", quantities with a hat superscript refer to the real world , whereas unhatted quantities refer to the training set .",
    "let us now recall that the activation @xmath34 of the output neuron can be interpreted as a logarithm of the ratio of posterior probabilities : @xmath35 this is simply the consequence of using the sigmoid function for activation . applying formulae  ( [ bayesa ] ) and ( [ bayesb ] ) to each of the two classes and taking the ratio of probabilities , we easily obtain : @xmath36 typically , @xmath37 . if the activation was originally @xmath38 , then this transformation maps it to below the decision boundary .",
    "only if the output is originally @xmath39 does the event remain above the decision boundary .",
    "thus , having initialized @xmath40 by the frequencies of the classes in the training set , we perform the following iterative steps .",
    "firstly , the formula @xmath41 is used to estimate the true probability of microlensing . here , @xmath42 runs through all @xmath43 patterns in the data set .",
    "then , for each pattern in the data set activation @xmath44 is adjusted using formula  ( [ correction ] ) and the output @xmath45 is re - calculated .",
    "the process is repeated until convergence . at the beginning of the iteration",
    ", @xmath46 is @xmath47 so that the sampling factor @xmath28 does not play an important role .",
    "however , after a few iterations , it becomes important .",
    "@xmath28 is really a higher dimensional analogue of the temporal efficiency @xmath48 .",
    "it can be calculated by generating events with uniform priors .",
    "in every cell of input space , we calculate the ratio of accepted events to generated events .",
    "the output of this procedure is the true probability of microlensing in the experiment monitoring @xmath49 stars and lasting for a duration @xmath50 . from this , the microlensing rate is @xmath51 the advantage of this algorithm is that the rate can be computed directly from the dataset , without the intervening steps of candidate selection and efficiency estimation ."
