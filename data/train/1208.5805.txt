    "time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory provides a fully self - consistent mean - field approach to nuclear dynamics .",
    "first employed in the late 1970 s  @xcite the applicability of tdhf was constrained by the limited computational power .",
    "therefore , early applications treated the problem in only one spatial dimension , utilizing a very simplified parametrization of the nuclear interaction . due to the increase in computational power ,",
    "state - of - the - art tdhf calculations are now feasible in three - dimensional coordinate space , without any symmetry restrictions and using the full skyrme interaction  @xcite .    in this work",
    "the wigner distribution function  @xcite is calculated as an analysis tool to probe the phase space behavior in tdhf evolution of nuclear dynamics . in comparison to previous work  @xcite , where the wigner analysis was performed in one and two dimensions , we are now able to carry out both the tdhf simulation and the phase - space analysis in three dimensions . transformation from coordinate - space representation to phase - space representation , i.e. calculating the wigner distribution from the density matrix , still remains a computationally challenging problem . here ,",
    "we present a fully three - dimensional analysis which allows the study of relaxation processes simultaneously in all directions in @xmath1-space . an early one - dimensional study of the wigner function for tdhf can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : wigner ] we introduce the wigner distribution function and discuss the numerical framework used in this work .",
    "we then introduce the principal observables summarizing the local or global momentum - space properties of the wigner function . first the quadrupole operator in momentum space which gives rise to the usual deformation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 to probe relaxation processes in dynamical calculations .",
    "in addition , we define an estimate for the occupied phase - space volume to obtain a relation between the fragment separation in momentum and coordinate space .",
    "[ sec : results ] provides a detailed discussion of the central @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca collision , paying particular attention to the effect of transparency .",
    "we discuss the impact of different skyrme parametrizations on the relaxation behavior , as well as the dependence on the center - of - mass energy for a fixed skyrme interaction .",
    "we also examine the influence of extra time - odd terms in the skyrme functional .",
    "the tdhf equations are solved on a three - dimensional cartesian lattice with a typical mesh spacing of @xmath4fm .",
    "the initial setup of a dynamic calculation needs a static hartree - fock run , whereby the stationary ground states of the two fragments are computed with the damped - gradient iteration algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the tdhf runs are initialized with energies above the coulomb barrier at some large but finite separation .",
    "the two ions are boosted with velocities obtained by assuming that the two nuclei arrive at this initial separation on a coulomb trajectory .",
    "the time propagation is managed by utilizing a taylor - series expansion of the time - evolution operator  @xcite up to sixth order with a time step of @xmath5fm / c .",
    "the spatial derivatives are calculated using the fast fourier transforms ( fft ) .",
    "the wigner distribution function is obtained by a partial fourier transform of the density matrix @xmath6 , with respect to the relative coordinate @xmath7    @xmath8    because @xmath9 is not positive definite , it is misleading to consider the wigner function as a phase - space probability distribution .",
    "we will refer to the appearance of negative values for @xmath9 in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "evaluating the wigner function in six - dimensional phase space is still a computational challenge and only possible employing full open mp parallelization and extensive use of fft s .",
    "the determing factor is the grid size , which results in @xmath10 steps to provide the wigner transform in full space , where @xmath11 are the grid points in each direction . storing the wigner function reduced to the reaction plane",
    ", i.e. @xmath12 at one time step will consume @xmath13 mb of disk space for the applications presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "going to larger grid sizes , needed for heavier systems , and/or storing the full three - dimensional wigner function will clearly result in entering the gb regime .      in this section",
    "we discuss some of the observables used in our analysis . in order to avoid any misunderstandings we will label all observables evaluated in momentum space with a subscript @xmath1 , and all observables in coordinate space with a subscript @xmath14 .      as an observable to probe relaxation in phase - space quantitatively ,",
    "we evaluate the quadrupole operator in momentum space .",
    "the local deviation of the momentum distribution from a spherical shape is a direct measure for equilibration .",
    "the local quadrupole tensor in @xmath1-space is given by @xmath15\\:,\\ ] ] using the @xmath16-th moment from the local momentum distribution @xmath17 with @xmath18 denoting the average local flow @xmath19 the spherical quadrupole moments @xmath20 and @xmath21 are computed by diagonalization of @xmath22 @xmath23 with @xmath24 labeling the eigenvalues of @xmath22 .",
    "switching to polar notation the observables @xmath25 are obtained via the dimensionless quantities @xmath26 where @xmath27 accounts for the local rms - radius in @xmath1-space .",
    "the norm is defined such that @xmath28 in the presented formalism it is straightforward to define global observables .",
    "the global quadrupole tensor is calculated by spatial integration @xmath29 applying the same diagonalization as in the local case ( [ eq : diag ] ) we end up with a global definition for @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for the following results we exclusively use the global definition since it is more compact and allows the simultaneous visualization of multiple time - dependent observables .",
    "to illustrate the global development of a reaction , we will also use the expectation value @xmath32 of the quadrupole operator in coordinate space .      to give a rough measure for the phase - space volume occupied by the fragments during a heavy - ion collision we assume a spherical shape of the local momentum distribution .",
    "adding up the @xmath1-spheres @xmath33 leads to the total occupied phase - space volume @xmath34",
    "it is the aim of this work to provide a quantitative analysis of the magnitude of relaxation processes occurring in tdhf .",
    "therefore we will vary a single reaction parameter , while all the other parameters are fixed .",
    "the @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca - system provides a suitable test case .",
    "this particular choice is motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite where the applicability of tdhf was demonstrated up to very high energies .",

    "while skms was chosen as an example for an outdated interaction , the sly(x ) set of forces was originally developed to study isotopic trends in neutron rich nuclei and neutron matter with applications in astrophysics .",
    "the ski(x ) forces take the freedom of an isovector spin - orbit force into account .",

    "a similar splitting behavior depending on the employed skyrme parametrization was already found in @xcite .",
    "while the two sk(x)-forces show a full separation of the two fragments , there is a slight remaining contact between the fragments for the case of sly6 , which will result in complete separation in a longer calculation .",

    "the @xmath41-value jumps between prolate and oblate configurations indicating that the momentum distribution oscillates between being aligned primarily in the beam direction or transverse to it . for the sake of completeness we additionally present the occupied phase - space volume ( c ) which will prove more useful for the next reaction parameter to be discussed : the center - of - mass energy .      as a second reaction parameter the center - of - mass energy , @xmath42 , is varied .",
    "results are presented for energies ranging from @xmath43mev / nucleon up to @xmath44mev / nucleon .",
    "the skyrme interaction now is fixed to be ski4 . for the case of the lowest ( highest )",
    "energy video  [ vid : ca160 ] ( video  [ vid : ca240 ] ) provides a video visualizing the reaction in phase space .",
    "the calculation done with the lowest energy @xmath45mev shows two fully separated fragments in the exit channel .",

    ". it may not be obvious at first why the fragments should split for lower energies and merge for higher ones .",
    "but the estimate for the occupied phase - space volume @xmath46 presented in subplot ( c ) indicates that @xmath47 increases with energy .",
    "therefore the fragments average distance in phase space is larger , while in compensation they can come closer to each other in coordinate space .",
    "however , this behavior is also dependent on the particular skyrme force used and the presence of time - odd terms , which is discussed in the next subsection .",

    "this leaves the choice of the time - odd terms in the functional ( current @xmath48 , spin - density @xmath49 , spin kinetic energy density @xmath50 , and the spin - current pseudotensor @xmath51 ) largely unspecified  @xcite .",
    "galilean invariance requires at least some of these terms to be present depending on the presence of the associated time - even term , e.g. @xmath48 for the @xmath52 combination . in our calculations",
    "we always include the time - odd part of the spin - orbit interaction . in order to investigate the effects of the remaining time - odd terms ,",
    "we have compared different choices by using a single skyrme parametrization and the same test case .",
    "we choose the force sly4 and start with the minimum number of time - odd terms which is needed to ensure galilean invariance  @xcite . in the next stage , we include also the spin - density terms proportional to @xmath49 . finally , we also add the combination which includes the tensor spin - current term @xmath53 .",
    "a comprehensive notation of the full skyrme functional can be found , e.g. in ref .  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extra ] , at least for the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath54 , varying these time - odd terms has a very little effect in the initial contact phase and the dynamical behavior becomes somewhat different only in later stages of the collision . on the other hand , small differences near the threshold energy ( the highest collision energy for a head - on collision that results in a composite system . at higher energies the nuclei go through each other ) can have large long - term effects on the outcome of the collision . for example",
    "a small difference in dissipation may be enough to influence the decision between re - seperation or forming a composite system .",
    "we have also checked a broader range of collision energies from the fusion regime up to deep inelastic collisions .",
    "the interesting quantity is the loss of fragment kinetic energy between the entrance and exit channels .",

    "the impact of different reaction parameters on the outcome of a heavy - ion collision was studied in detail for the @xmath0ca+@xmath0ca system .",
    "we find that the occurrence of transparency is clearly reflected in the global asymmetry of the wigner momentum distribution . the surprising result that in some cases the system merges at higher energies and shows transparency at lower ones can be related to the interplay between momentum- and configuration - space volumes which is a reflection of the pauli principle .",
    "it is also interesting that the two distributions in phase - space never truly combine to form a single distribution .",
    "this clearly indicates that two - body collisions will be necessary to achieve true equilibrium as the reaction proceeds to longer contact times .",
