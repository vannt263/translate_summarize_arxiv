    "<S> jos rodrguez - quintero    departamento de fsica atmica , molecular y nuclear , universidad de sevilla , spain +    the scattering of high energy fermions by a wall separating two phases of different symmetry properties has received much attention recently . </S>",
    "<S> the main physical motivation of these works is the idea@xcite that the baryon asymmetry of the universe might have been produced if the cosmological electroweak phase transition has been of first order . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is described in terms of bubbles of a spontaneously broken symmetry vacuum expanding in a preexisting symmetric one . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> the point to elucidate is whether there exists a cp - asymmetry that produces a different reflection and transmission probability for quarks and antiquarks in order to explain , via the standard model baryon number anomaly@xcite , the correct baryon asymmetry of the universe . in order to simplify the treatment , </S>",
    "<S> an useful assumption is to break down the process into two steps , one describing the production of cp asymmetry when the quarks / antiquarks are reflected on the wall , the second describing the transport and the eventual transformation of the cp asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the first of two steps justifies the effort concentrated in the study of the scattering of fermions in the presence of first order phase transition@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the wall depends on the higgs field effective potential that takes into account the effects of the surrounding plasma trough the temperature of a certain thermal bath . </S>",
    "<S> the wall profile obtained by solving the equation of motion with this effective potential is rather complex and depends on too many coupling constants@xcite , thus the study of the general wall profile problem@xcite@xcite is justified not only from a purely formal interest . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown in a previous work@xcite the connection between the complex plane poles of the wall profile function and the behaviour of fermions hitting the wall in the high energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , by performing an extreme simplification which allows to compute the feynman fermion propagator in an exact way @xcite , the wall profile can be approximated by a step function , i.e. a sudden jump from one phase to the other , that is called the thin wall approximation@xcite , @xcite . in this case , the reflection coefficient in the high energy limit is ] ,    r(e)=m_02e  , [ 1 ]    being the mass @xmath0 the high of the wall . </S>",
    "<S> notice the power law dependence on @xmath1 of the reflection coefficient in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) . as we will see , the results given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can not be directly applied to profile functions which are not analytic in the real axis , as the step profile function . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in this note we show the high energy behaviour of a new kind of profile functions , which can be considered in a certain limit as analytic extensions in the complex plane of the step function , by following @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we will investigate the appropriate limit in order to understand the result ( [ 1 ] ) through the analytic properties of the step function extensions .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we outline the derivation of the high energy asymptotic expression for the reflection coefficient given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the detailed calculation can be found .    by formulating the problem in the rest frame of a wall normal to the @xmath2-axis , characterized by a general non - cp - violating wall profile , and working in the chiral basis@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we can factor the dirac equation into @xmath3 identical blocks . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the problem is reduced to solve the following equation ,    ( i _ z + q(z ) ) _ i / ii = 0  , [ 2 ]    with    \\(z ) = (    cc e & -m(z ) + m(z ) & -e    ) = _ i _ ii e^-iet  ; [ 3 ]    where @xmath4 is the time - independent dirac equation solution in the chiral basis . </S>",
    "<S> we express the solution of ( [ 3 ] ) as follows    _ </S>",
    "<S> i / ii(z ) = ( z , z_0 ) (    c _ </S>",
    "<S> 1(z_0 ) + _ 2(z_0 )    )  , [ 4 ]    with    ( z , z_0)=_p_e^i^z_z_0d ( )  ; [ 5 ]    where @xmath5 indicates a path ordered product and @xmath6 is the position variable along the z - axis . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the profile wall function . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic conditions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are required , @xmath11 decreasing exponentially when @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , after some tedious calculation we obtain from equations ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] )    ( z , z_0 ) = ( 1 + ( m_0 e)_2 _ z_0^z d  p ( )  f ( )  e^-2i_3_^z dp ( ) . </S>",

    "<S> et al_@xcite , we can obtain the reflection coefficient from the result ( [ 6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by assuming in general that    f()=f ( )  , [ 7 ]    where the parameter @xmath14 gives the wall thickness , and after much calculation@xcite , we finally obtain    r(e ) = 2 m_0 _ </S>",

    "<S> the order of the pole @xmath19 is @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> the result ( [ 8 ] ) is valid in general for profile functions which are analytic in the real axis , i.e. analytic functions in all the complex plane except in certain isolated singular points with non - zero imaginary part . </S>",
    "<S> it is positively checked in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by using the particular kink - type wall profile@xcite@xcite , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider now the more general kind of functions    f()= 11 + ( -^2n+1 )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ 9 ]    it is obvious that the functional behaviour of the kink - type wall is a particular case of the latter , given by taking @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , any of these functions gives the step function if the limit @xmath23 is taken . in order to apply the result ( [ 8 ] ) to the functions ( [ 9 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we must know the singularities of these functions and their distribution in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 7 ] ) , we obtain for the poles of @xmath18    z_jk = ^1m(1 + 2j)^1 m e^im(12 + 2k )  ; [ 10 ]    with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . where @xmath26 is the power in the exponential argument in ( [ 9 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the order of all the poles is @xmath27 and the residous , @xmath28 , can be written as    b_-1^jk = 1m^1-mm e^i1-mm(12 + 2k )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ 11 ]    it is easy to see that these poles are distributed in the complex plane along @xmath29 radial axes , on circumferences with radius given by @xmath30^{1/m}$ ] , where @xmath31 . in fact , the distribution of the poles is symmetric with regard to the real axis . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic location of the poles in the complex plane for @xmath32 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be found that the two poles with lower positive imaginary part are    z_0,0=^1me^i2 m z_0,m-12=^1me^i(1 - 12 m )  , [ 12 ]    and by applying the result ( [ 8 ] ) in the range of energies @xmath33 , we obtain    r(e)=2(2-_m,1)m^1mm_0   e^-2 ^ 1m(2m)e  ; [ 14 ]    where all the decreasing exponential terms except the two with lowest arguments has been neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath34 arises because the two poles considered in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 12 ] ) are the same for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential law of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 14 ] ) is the expected behaviour for the reflection coefficient provided that the result ( [ 8 ] ) can be applied , if the energy is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the reflection coefficient for the step wall profile which presents a power law asymptotic behaviour , as we mentioned above , does not seem to be coherent with the former . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we must take into account that the result ( [ 8 ] ) relates the high energy behaviour of the fermions hitting a wall to the analytic properties of the profile function in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we must appropriately extend the step profile in the complex plane to investigate if the obtained poles allow to explain the behaviour given by ( [ 1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily seen that the limit of the functions ( [ 9 ] ) , for all @xmath36 , when the parameter @xmath14 goes to zero is the step function . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in that limit , any of those can be considered as an analytic extension in the complex plane for the step function . by considering that the function @xmath37 is the same than @xmath8 , but scaled by the parameter @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> , we have the same pattern for the distribution of poles of @xmath8 than for that of @xmath37 , but with the distance between two consecutive poles depending on @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the poles will be as close to each other along the same radial axes as @xmath14 small . </S>",
    "<S> the result ( [ 8 ] ) can not be strictly applied for @xmath38 , but we know that if the limit when @xmath23 of the high energy reflection coefficient exists , it must be the same obtained by using ( [ 8 ] ) , which is valid for any non - zero @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point in this approach is that when @xmath14 is getting smaller and smaller we can not consider a large enough energy , @xmath1 , to neglect the contribution other than the closest poles to the real axis . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the contributions due to each pole have to be summed before to take the limit and there is no reason to expect an exponential final result .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have    r(e ) = 2 m_0 _ k=0^m-1_j=0^n </S>",
    "<S> e^-2ey_j e^2iex_j b_-1^jk  , [ 15 ]    where @xmath28 is defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 11 ] ) and @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the real and pure imaginary components of @xmath41 , given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 10 ] ) . by taking @xmath23 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 14 ] ) , the sum for @xmath42 from @xmath43 to @xmath44 can be considered as an integral and after some appropriate transformations , we obtain    r(e)=m_02e  _ </S>",
    "<S> k=0^m-1  e^i_k _ 0^dt  e^-t_ke^it_k  ; [ 16 ]    where    & & _ k = ( 1-m)(12 + 2k )  , + & & _ k = ( 12 + 2k )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ 17 ]    as we only sum for the poles with positive imaginary part , the signs @xmath45 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 17 ] ) are for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . by solving eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 16 ] ) , we obtain    r(e)=m_02e  _ </S>",
    "<S> k=0^m-1 e^i(_k+2-_k ) = m_02e \\ { m+12 - m-12 } + = m_02e  ; [ 18 ]    which agrees with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) . in consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the power law behaviour which is characteristic for the step function , as well as for any non - continuous function , and therefore non - analytic , in the real axis , can be well understood through the complex analytic properties of these functions . </S>",
    "<S> the high energy reflection behaviour is caused by the sum of the contributions due to each singularity of the profile function . </S>",
    "<S> for a large enough energy the contributions of one or several of these singularities can be considered as leading , provided that the singular points are isolated . </S>",
    "<S> we only must take into account that the real non - continuous point is produced when the poles of the function are distributed in an infinitely compact way along lines in the complex plane which contains this point to understand the power law for the step . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the smoother decreasing on the energy of the reflection coefficient for the sharp profiles can be explained because no singularity contribution can be isolated in order to lead the total result .    * aknowledgements *    i thank o. pne and m. lozano for essential comments and very helpful discussions . </S>",
