    "to describe the inversion algorithms for multi  quarks , we start by giving a general formula for _ shifted _ matrix , a multiple of the identity plus a constant off - diagonal part , @xmath3 the parameter @xmath4 stands for a whole trajectory . in lattice qcd theory the fermion matrix , with respect to quark mass@xcite @xmath5 has the shifted structure@xcite , and they are related to each other by , @xmath6 where term @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are fermion matrices for _ light _ quark ( considered as _ seed _ system ) and _ heavy _ quark ( _ extrapolated _ system ) respectively .    by numbering all even sites before the odd ones , we rewrite dirac equation @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , then separate it into the so - called even - odd preconditioned form : @xmath13 for the smeared source the equation @xmath14 is further decoupled , by setting @xmath15 , @xmath16 such that the right hands of these equations are independent of @xmath17 .",
    "an iterative process to solve the nonsingular system @xmath18 starts from an initial guess @xmath19 and an initial residual @xmath20 .",
    "the nonsymmetric lanczos process@xcite generates an orthogonal basis for the krylov subspace @xmath21 to obtain an approximate solution @xmath22 in @xmath23th step iteratively with short recurrences and to keep @xmath24 .",
    "it is essential to notice for inversion with multi - quarks that , on the trajectory of the shifted matrices , their krylov spaces are identical@xcite .",
    "two directions to achieve good efficiency , besides a good preconditioning@xcite , are considered currently@xcite : ( a ) acceleration of convergence using improved iterative procedures ( such as qmr and bicgstab2 ) .",
    "( b ) exploitation of structure of the matrix @xmath25 in the inverters ( such as @xmath0symmetry and _ shifted _ properties ) . in this paper",
    "we attempt to test minimal residual ( mr ) , quasi - minimal residual ( qmr ) and bi - conjugate gradient ( bicg ) , exploiting the @xmath0symmetry and using the _ shifted _ feature for inversion with multi - quarks@xcite . for definiteness we consider only @xmath26sources and solve one of the expressions in eq . 6 as @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "first we mention that , after even - odd precondition , the matrix @xmath29 still has @xmath0symmetry and they are shifted matrices for multi - quarks .",
    "our numerical computations were done for the even - odd preconditioned systems on lattices @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and for the quenched gauge configurations at @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we tested the multiple - masses - minimal residual ( m@xmath34r ) method for matrix inversion with multi - quarks and then compare the results of convergence rates with those obtained by using the qmr and bicg algorithms .      to solve @xmath35 , the m@xmath34r algorithm is given by ( initial : @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 where @xmath22 and @xmath38 are the @xmath23th approximate solution and residual respectively for the seed system .",
    "@xmath39 is the @xmath23th approximate solution for one of the extrapolated systems and coefficient @xmath40 is iterated step by step for each quark mass .",
    "it is necessary to take @xmath41 for seed system to keep all initial residuals @xmath42 to be the same for different quark masses .",
    "as shown by the algorithm , the matrix - vector multiplication performs only once in the whole set @xmath43 at each iterative step . for each additional quark mass ,",
    "the price to pay is one vector @xmath44 to be stored and a little cpu times ( about 8% for scalar products ) , with no additional matrix multiplication performed .",
    "we take the system at @xmath45 as a seed and extrapolate to heavier quarks at @xmath46 and 0.148 , as shown in fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 . the results give evidence that the gain factor is about 2 by using the m@xmath34r for 5 extrapolated quarks as compared to calculating the 5 quarks separately for @xmath26 sources .",
    "the overrelaxation parameter @xmath47 is chosen to be @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "3 ) for best convergence rate . in these plots",
    "the relative residual is defined by @xmath49 .",
    "the stopping criteria for convergence is @xmath50 .",
    "the quasi - minimal residual exploiting the @xmath0-symmetry is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to solve eq",
    ". 6 for shifted matrix ( see eq .",
    "1 ) , it performs : @xmath51    in steps ii and iii , there is no matrix multiplication in the @xmath23th approximation .",
    "it is obvious that , to solve the dirac equation with multi - quarks , the matrix multiplication is carried out only at @xmath52 point for the whole set of @xmath4 . due to the @xmath0-symmetry of @xmath29 , @xmath53 ,",
    "the computational effort at each lanczos step reduces to one matrix multiplication , instead of two ( for @xmath29 and @xmath54 each ) , and the coefficients are all real .",
    "the price to pay is three vectors @xmath55 to be stored for each additional quark .",
    "4 gives the results of the relative residuals versus the iteration steps at several @xmath17 s respectively .",
    "the plot of fig.5 shows that qmr@xmath0 is faster than mr in convergency at @xmath45 .",
    "but this feature could be reduced by the gmres(4 ) , which can save 30% iterations compared with mr , but at the expense of 3 more vectors in memory@xcite .",
    "bicg method@xcite exploiting the @xmath0-symmetry is @xmath56    this two - term recurrence method has difficulty in memory capacity for multi  quarks : the coefficients in the @xmath23th step for different values of @xmath4 can not be obtained from those for @xmath52 by short recurrences .",
    "in addition , this algorithm also shows large fluctuations in the relative residual ( fig .",
    "6 ) which can be eliminated by the variant bicgstab@xcite algorithm .",
    "for problems involving the inversion of multi - quark matrices , we find m@xmath34r or gmres to be a good compromise if the memory is limited .",
    "it requires only one more vector for each additional quark and the overhead in cpu time is minimal ( @xmath57 ) . on the other hand , qmr is faster than m@xmath34r .",
    "however , it requires memory of 3 vectors for each additional quark and a look - ahead algorithm to avoid the breakdown@xcite .",
    "bicg@xmath0 does not admit multi - quark implementation with short recurrences and the relative residual fluctuates in a large range .",
