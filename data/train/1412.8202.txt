    "protein secondary structure elements ( psse ) are the basic building blocks of proteins and their form and arrangement is of fundamental importance for protein folding and function .",
    "they have been first predicted by pauling and corey on the basis of hydrogen bonding  @xcite and were later confirmed by x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "the localization of psses in protein structure databases is one of the most basic tasks in bioinformatics and various methods have been developed for this purpose .",
    "we mention here dssp ( define secondary structure of proteins)@xcite and stride ( structural identification )  @xcite , which assign psses on the basis of geometrical , energetic and statistical criteria and which are the most widely used approaches .",
    "the result are contiguous domains along the amino acid sequence of the protein , which are labeled as `` @xmath1-helix '' , `` @xmath2-strand '' , etc .",
    "there is no precise and universally accepted definition for psses , and therefore each method produces slightly different results .",
    "the geometrical variability of these psses , which depends on the global protein fold , is not explicitly considered by these approaches .",
    "the published screwfit method   allows for both assignment and geometrical description of psses .",
    "it describes the geometry of the protein backbone by a succession of screw motions linking successive  groups in the peptide bonds , from which psses can be assigned on the basis of statistically established thresholds for the local helix parameters .",
    "the latter have been derived by screening the astral database  @xcite , which provides representative protein structure sets containing essentially one secondary structure motif .",
    "the screwfit description is intuitive and bears some ressemblances with the p - curve approach proposed by sklenar , etchebest and lavery  @xcite , in the sense that both methods lead to a sequence of local helix axes , the ensemble of which defines an overall axis of the protein under consideration",
    ". uses , however , a set of parameters and was originally developed to pinpoint changes in protein structure due to external stress .",
    "the experimental basis for the automated assignment of psses in proteins is x - ray crystallography , which yields information about the positions of the heavy atoms in a protein . although the number of resolved protein structures increased almost exponentially during the last two decades , the fraction of proteins for which the atomic structure is known is still very small .",
    "low resolution techniques , like electron microscopy , are an additional source of information and in this context the description of psses must be correspondingly simplified , in order to be useful in structure refinement .",
    "a natural and commonly used coarse - grained description of proteins is the @xmath0-model , where each residue is represented by its respective @xmath0-atom on the protein backbone  @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "_ were the first to publish a method of secondary structure assignment on the basis of the @xmath0-positions@xcite , and different approaches for that purpose have been published since then  @xcite .",
    "like dssp and stride , these methods aim at assigning psses on a true / false basis and the underlying models for this decision are not exploited or not exploitable for a more detailed description of protein folds .",
    "the motivation of this paper was to develop an extension of the screwfit method which works only with the @xmath0-positions , maintaining the capability to describe the global fold of a protein by a minimalistic model and to assign psses .",
    "the method is described in section  [ sec : method ] and two applications are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : applications ] . a short rsum with an outlook concludes the paper .",

    "one can only use forward and backward differences , respectively , and a second - order interpolation of the @xmath0-space to identical @xmath20-planes at the first and last two @xmath0-positions , which is not compatible with a helicoidal curve . in this case",
    "we resort to third - order interpolation , such that @xmath21 we note here that the frenet frames constructed at the @xmath0-positions 2@xmath22 are identical with the so - called `` discrete frenet frames '' introduced in ref .",

    "the inherent fuziness of secondary structure definitions leads to arbitrary choices and thus inevitable differences .",
    "the most frequent deviation between two assignments is the end points of secondary structure elements , where a difference of one or two residues is common and acceptable .",
    "another frequent deviation concerns deformed secondary structure elements , which one method may identify as a single element whereas another one recognizes it as multiple distinct elements .",
    "we therefore chose a statistical comparison to compare the screwframe results to those of dssp , which is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : alpha - comparison ] for @xmath1-helices and  [ fig : beta - comparison ] for @xmath2-strands .",
    "we consider two quantities : ( 1 ) the total number of residues of a given structure which are inside a recognized secondary - structure element , and ( 2 ) the length of each individual secondary - structure element .",
    "we compute the first quantity for both methods and show their joint distribution ( upper plot in the two figures ) .",
    "for the vast majority of structures , the two residue counts are close to equal , which means that neither method yields systematically more or longer secondary - structure elements than the other .",
    "the lower plots show the distributions of the lengths of individual secondary - structure elements . for @xmath1-helices",
    ", dssp has a fatter tail ( helices of length  20 or more ) , whereas screwframe identifies a larger number of short helices .",
    "the reason for these differences is that screwframe tends to split up kinked helices which dssp identifies as single units . for @xmath2-strands ,",
    "we notice that dssp identifies many more very short elements .",
    "this is due to the different definitions : a single @xmath2-type hydrogen bond is sufficient to define a @xmath2-sheet in dssp , but screwframe requires at least three consecutive residues to identify any regular structure .",
    "we have presented a generalization of the screwfit method for protein structure assignment and description , which uses only the positions of the @xmath0-atoms along the protein backbone . as in the screwfit approach ,",
    "the global protein fold is described as a succession of screw motions relating consecutive recurrent motifs along the protein backbone , but the `` motifs '' are here the tripods ( planes ) formed by the three ( two ) orthonormal vectors of the local frenet bases to the @xmath0 space curve . despite the fact that screwframe uses less information than screwfit , all standard psses are recognized on the basis of thresholds for the local screw radii and a suitably defined regularity measure .",
    "screwframe even permits to distinguish between parallel and antiparallel @xmath2-strands , which the classical screwfit method fails to do . a thorough comparison with the commonly used dssp method on the assignment of psses in the astral database shows that both methods yield very similar results for the total amount of psses",
    ". screwframe tends , however , to break long helices into smaller pieces , such that the length distribution of psses is different . due to the minimalistic character of the geometrical model for protein folds ,",
    "the evaluation of the screwframe model parameters is very efficient .",
    "this allows for working with protein structure databases and for analyzing simulated molecular dynamics trajectories of proteins .",
    "screwframe may also be used a starting point for the development of minimalistic models for protein structure and dynamics , similar to the wormlike chain model  @xcite , which has been successfully applied to dna  @xcite . as already mentioned",
    ", our method can also be used to analyze dynamical processes , such as the folding and unfolding of peptides  @xcite    an activepaper  @xcite containing all the software , input datasets , and results from this study is available as supplementary material .",
