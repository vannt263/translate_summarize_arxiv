    "in view of the unified model of active galactic nuclei @xcite blazars are active galaxies , where the angle between the line of sight and the jet is very small and the emission of the jet is strongly doppler boosted outshining in some cases the host galaxy .",
    "blazars are variable on all time scales from years down to just a few minutes .",
    "thus , they are extremely useful to analyse the properties and physics of relativistic jets in very different emission states .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is characterized by two broad components .",
    "the low energetic one peaks in the infrared to x - ray part of the spectrum , and is attributed to synchrotron emission of highly relativistic electrons . the high energetic component peaks in the mev to tev energy regime , and its origin is a matter of debate .",
    "in leptonic models @xcite the high energetic emission is attributed to inverse compton radiation by the same electron population scattering the ambient photon fields , namely the self - made synchrotron emission ( synchrotron - self compton , ssc , @xcite ) or ambient external photon fields ( external compton , ec , e.g. @xcite ) . in hadronic models the high energetic component originates from protons ,",
    "either by direct proton synchrotron emission , or via by - products of photo - meson production @xcite .",
    "this paper deals with the leptonic scenario , where protons , if available , only serve as a cold background .    the standard one - zone model for blazar emission attributes the detected radiation to a homogeneous , spherical volume located somewhere in the jet .",
    "the particles are continuously injected into the blob resulting in an equilibrium situation , which has the advantage of an easy mathematical solution for the differential equation describing the electron distribution function .",
    "this model has been successfully used in many blazars to describe both quiescence and flaring modes .    in recent publications",
    "a small change of the one - zone model has been discussed , which has profound implications for the resulting spectra and light curves .",
    "namely , the continuous injection has been replaced by a time - dependent injection .",
    "in such a scenario the electrons can not reach equilibrium , as long as no continuous re - acceleration is provided . since the electron cooling due to ssc emission depends on the self - produced synchrotron photon energy density , which in turn depends on the electron distribution function itself , the ssc electron cooling becomes non - linear and time - dependent . obviously , this has strong consequences .",
    "as was shown analytically by @xcite and @xcite using an instantaneous injection of the radiating particles at time @xmath0 , the non - linear cooling significantly reduces the cooling time scales compared to the standard linear ( and continuous ) model .",
    "additionally , in a non - equilibrium model the cooling behaviour can change with severe impacts on the emerging radiation . on the one hand , cooling due to synchrotron and external compton emission is linear , at least in a simple model as utilised in this work ( but see for example @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the efficiency of the ssc cooling term decreases with respect to time , since the energy density in the synchrotron photons decreases due to the energy losses of the electrons .",
    "hence , after some time the linear cooling terms become stronger than the ssc cooling term , and the cooling behaviour changes from non - linear to linear . using the instructive example of a monochromatic particle injection with initial electron lorentz factor @xmath1 , the changing cooling effect has been explored first by @xcite .",
    "further implications have been presented by @xcite . in summary , each component of the emerging sed exhibits an additional break , which is solely due to the changing cooling behaviour without the need for complicated electron distributions .",
    "furthermore , the emerging lightcurves show strong differences compared to a purely linear model , like a reduction of the variability time scale at high energies , while the variability at low energies follows the conventional time scales .    in this work the important aspect of photo - pair production in the time - dependent injection scenario",
    "is discussed . in photo - pair production",
    "a high energetic photon interacts with a low energetic photon producing an electron - positron pair .",
    "if the energy sum of both photons exceeds at least twice the electron rest energy an electron - positron pair is created , while the photons are destroyed .",
    "hence , the source becomes optically thick and the detected flux can be significantly reduced . here ,",
    "the implications on the optical depth by the time - dependent injection model are presented and compared to the standard one - zone model .    in section",
    "[ sec : gamgamabs ] the photo - pair production and the necessary integral formula is described .",
    "the following sections introduce first the soft photon fields , namely the internal time - dependent synchrotron , ssc and ec radiation , followed by the calculation of the respective optical depths . in section",
    "[ sec : ext ] the optical depth due to the external soft photon field is calculated . the influence of all these photon fields on the sed is discussed in section [ sec : sed ] by applying the absorption to model seds .",

    "synchrotron - self absorption is an important process for low energetic synchrotron photons .",
    "the calculations have been performed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) and are briefly described in appendix [ app : ssa ] for the sake of completeness .",
    "the description concentrates on the synchrotron - self absorption transition energy , which can potentially be used to constrain the free parameters .",
    "details with respect to the emerging synchrotron sed can be found in @xcite .",
    "high energy photons can be absorbed in photo - pair production where the high energy photon couples with a low energetic target photon producing an electron - positron pair : @xmath2 the optical depth is calculated along the path of the @xmath3-ray from its origin to the observer through a target photon field .",
    "if the target photon field is isotropically distributed in a sphere around the @xmath3-ray radiation zone the path length equals the radius @xmath4 of the target photon sphere .",
    "then , the optical depth is derived by @xmath5 with the target photon number density @xmath6 , the pair production cross section @xmath7 , the normalized target photon energy @xmath8 , and the normalized energy of the high energetic photons @xmath9 .",
    "the energies are normalized to the electron rest energy as @xmath10 . for internal target photon fields the path length",
    "@xmath4 equals the radius of the emission blob @xmath11 , while for external soft target photons the path length is denoted as @xmath12 being typically larger than @xmath11 .",
    "the time variable is marked as @xmath13 .",
    "since the intensity of an optically thick source is corrected by the factor @xmath14 , a rule of thumb says that a source is opaque if @xmath15 .",
    "this rule is utilzed below to derive the energy regime for which the source is optically thick .",
    "the pair production cross section is given by , e.g. , @xcite as @xmath16 \\label{eq : sigmagggen1 } { \\,\\ , , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 , and the thomson cross section @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "this form of the cross section is not useful for analytical calculations",
    ". a simpler form of the cross section is used below , which takes into account that the maximum of the cross section is actually very close to the minimal energy requirement @xmath20 ( in order to have sufficient energy to produce the electron - positron pair at rest ) .",

    "inserting equations ( [ eq : sigmagggen2 ] ) and ( [ eq : photdens1 ] ) in equation ( [ eq : taugggen1 ] ) yields @xmath25 where the path length @xmath4 needs to be specified according to the cases considered .",
    "below , the optical depth is calculated for several target photon fields .",
    "first , synchrotron and ssc target photons are utilised ( section [ sec : synssc ] ) , followed by the ec photons ( section [ sec : ec ] ) .",
    "the respective intensities necessary for equation ( [ eq : photdens1 ] ) are presented in section [ sec : intdis ] , and briefly derived in appendix [ app : int ] .",
    "for these three cases @xmath26 .    as a fourth example",
    "the external photons themselves are used , although the target photon number density needs to be derived in a slightly different way , which is described in section [ sec : ext ] . in this case",
    "the path length becomes @xmath27 .",
    "the derivation of the internal synchrotron , ssc and ec intensities in the outlined scenario ( i.e. , instantaneous injection of monochromatic electrons : @xmath28 ) has been performed by @xcite . a short summary of the calculations and the definitions and values of the parameters is given in appendix [ app : int ] . in this section , only the important results for the following calculations are quoted .",
    "the solutions to the kinetic equation ( see equation ( [ eq : kineq1 ] ) ) are dependent on two parameters , namely the external compton parameter @xmath29 and the injection parameter @xmath30 . they are discussed in some detail , since they govern the cooling behaviour of the source .    the external compton parameter @xmath29 is defined as the ratio of the linear cooling terms : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the magnetic energy density of a tangled magnetic field with strength @xmath33gauss , and @xmath34 the energy density in external photons in the galactic frame .",
    "the prefactor gives the angle - averaged lorentz transformation from the galactic to the comoving frame for an isotropic photon field traversing the emission blob .",
    "the blob moves with lorentz factor @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the injection parameter @xmath30 is defined as the square root of the ratio of the non - linear to the linear cooling terms at time of injection : @xmath36 the parameters are @xmath37 s@xmath38 , and @xmath39 @xmath40s@xmath38 .",

    "@xmath49 the linear cooling terms control the cooling behaviour .",
    "the normalized cross - over time is defined as @xmath50 depending solely on the value of the injection parameter .",
    "the change in the cooling behaviour is the important consequence of the model having strong consequences for the resulting seds and lightcurves , as is outlined in the introduction .",
    "equation ( [ eq : defalpha ] ) implies that a higher density @xmath44 of particles increases the probability of non - linear cooling , while a strong external source ( @xmath51 ) decreases this probability .",
    "a large value of the injection parameter could be realised by a small emission region , since @xmath52 ( see also equation ( 19 ) of @xcite ) .    both equations ( [ eq : deflec ] ) and ( [ eq : defalpha ] ) are strictly valid only in the thomson regime of inverse compton scattering , since the cooling terms as given in appendix [ app : int ] neglect the influence of the klein - nishina effect at high electron energies .",
    "the inclusion of klein - nishina effects gives interesting results , such as a hardening of the emitted synchrotron spectrum at high energies or the suppression of inverse compton radiation at high @xmath3-ray energies @xcite .",

    "the interesting consequence of the limited range of energies , which is affected by the optical depth according to equation ( [ eq : transrangesynssc1 ] ) , is that not all photons above a certain threshold are actually captured .",
    "high energy photons might still escape , while lower energy photons can not . over time",
    "both limits increase .",
    "interestingly , since the intensities drop significantly faster for high energies than for low energies , no more high energy photons might be produced when the source becomes optically thick for them .",
    "the lower energy photons are in the optical thick regime at first and only at later times are able to escape .",

    "the red dashed curve shows the cut - off energy of the ssc intensity , which serves as an example for the time - dependent behaviour of the high energy photons ( see appendix [ app : ssccoe ] ) .",
    "ssc photons of a given energy are emitted to the left of the red dashed line , while there are no photons produced to the right of the line .",
    "the dark shaded area marks the energy range , which is actually affected by the absorption , since at these times photons of these energies are produced in the source . in the light grey area the optical depth is irrelevant , because no more photons are produced at these energies .",
    "the behaviour described in the previous paragraph is obvious in figure [ fig : ssc ] , but it also applies for the synchrotron target in figure [ fig : syn ] . however , in figure [ fig : syn ] the energy limits are higher than in figure [ fig : ssc ] , and the highest emitted energies are captured by the synchrotron target with the given parameters .    in both figures [ fig : syn ] and",
    "[ fig : ssc ] the same parameters are used .",
    "one should note that these are extreme parameters with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "for the synchrotron case this choice results in a high maximum optical depth of @xmath101 .",
    "however , only the very highest energies of the ssc intensity are affected by the optical depth . at these energies",
    "the ssc intensity is already very low , as one can deduce from the very short emission time indicated by the red dashed line .",
    "reducing @xmath30 and @xmath29 would result in a reduced @xmath96 , but would not significantly change the absorbed energy region .",
    "hence , the effect of the synchrotron target field on the resulting sed is minor for the given choice of parameters .",
    "increasing , for example , the initial electron lorentz factor would also result in a reduction of the maximum optical depth , but would on the other hand increase the energy region affected by photo - pair production , since the lower energy limit decreases and the ssc intensity reaches higher energies .    for figure [ fig : ssc ] the extreme parameters are necessary to obtain some absorption at all .",
    "the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 correspond to a compton dominance ( ratio of the maximum value of the high energetic component to the maximum value of the synchrotron component ) of roughly a factor @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "hence , the flux of the inverse compton component is a factor @xmath102 higher than the flux in the synchrotron component . such large values of the compton dominance are not observed , and are usually @xmath103 .",

    "the dark shaded area in figure [ fig : ec ] is the optically thick region for ssc photons , used again as an example for the high energy intensity .",
    "however , from the extreme parameter settings one can conclude that @xmath117 absorption with an ec photon target is not an issue for blazars .",
    "in this section the photo - pair production by an external photon target is calculated .",
    "it is kept on a basic level , since the absorption by such a photon field is discussed extensively in the literature , for example @xcite , and many more .",
    "one can think of a lot of different external photon targets , such as the accretion disk photons , the broad line region ( blr ) or the dusty torus .",
    "these possibilities differ in size and energy content , and thus their contribution to the optical depth around the emission blob strongly depends on the distance of the blob to the central black hole .",
    "a strong debate continues in the literature about the location of the `` blazar emission zone '' , as can also be seen in the above given citations .    as mentioned in section [ sec : gamgamabs ] the high energy photons produced in the emission blob",
    "can be absorbed in the entire external photon region .",
    "therefore the path length becomes @xmath27 , which is scaled below as @xmath118pc , because @xmath119pc is a typical upper limit of the blr size .",
    "in @xcite the external photon target for the inverse compton scattering was modelled as a line - like @xmath53-function ( see equation ( [ eq : defuecline ] ) ) , which could be produced by the blr . since , however , the integral of the optical depth already contains a delta - function , the delta function of the external photons is exchanged by a gaussian in order to keep a similar model : @xmath120 where @xmath121 marks the widths of the gaussian .",
    "it is a free parameter , which strongly influences the resulting energy range of the optical depth , as will be discussed later .",
    "since the number of photons and the energy density are connected by the relation @xmath122 , the photon number density becomes @xmath123 from the definition of @xmath29 , one can rewrite the energy density in external photons as @xmath124 .",
    "then , the optical depth becomes @xmath125 with @xmath126    the consequence of equation ( [ eq : tauext1 ] ) is twofold .",
    "firstly , the optical depth is obviously not time - dependent .",
    "secondly , there is no distinct maximum .",
    "this implies that one can search for the energy @xmath127 where @xmath128 , and for all energies above the source is optically thick for all times .",
    "the transition energy can be easily computed : @xmath129 for @xmath130 ( i.e. , the gaussian becomes a @xmath53-function ) , the second summand in the denominator approaches zero and the transition energy becomes @xmath131 .",

    "the optical depth due to the external photon field must be treated separately , and is denoted by @xmath139 .",
    "the distinction between @xmath8 and @xmath9 has been dropped .    with equation ( [ eq : optthickint ] ) the optically thick intensity distributions for all energies and times",

    "the same is true for the lower left plot , while in the lower right plot the effect is probably hidden by the strong influence of the external photon field . in the upper right plot the influence is barely discernible , because of the strong impact by the klein - nishina reduction .",

    "the effect on intermediate energies is clearly visible .",
    "the slight shift of the dip position between the ssc and ec component can be explained by the different evolutions of the respective intensities with respect to time .",
    "the ssc intensity evolves much faster than the ec intensity , which means that the maximum of the intensity distribution of the ssc moves faster to lower energies than the maximum of the ec in any given time interval .",
    ", the lower break energy of the ssc component implies a faster evolution . ] and since the optical depths is also strongly time - dependent ( at least for the synchrotron , ssc , and ec targets ) the position of the dip in the total sed differs between the ssc and the ec component .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : ec ] the influence of the ec target can be safely neglected .    the lower row in figure [ fig : sed ] includes the external photon field .",
    "apart from the emerging ec component , the severe effect of the absorption by the external field is obvious .",
    "irrespective of the initial internal parameters both ssc and ec component are cut - off at roughly @xmath149hz in both plots . hence , potential dips at higher energies caused by the internal fields are not visible .",
    ".constant parameters in figure [ fig : sed ] . [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      due to retardation effects the chosen size of the emission region @xmath150 implies a minimum variability time scale of @xmath151min in the observer s frame . reducing the size of the emission region by 1 order of magnitude would make @xmath152 comparable to the fastest observed variabilities on the order of a few minutes @xcite .",
    "according to the results presented above , the optical depth would also be reduced .",
    "however , the observed radiation power would be reduced like - wise , which is in contrast to the observational fact that short variability time scales correspond to extraordinary high flux states .",
    "hence , in order to verify if the time - dependent injection model is able to explain the most rapid variabilities , the string of arguments laid out by @xcite is followed . according to equation ( [ eq : tauggint1 ] ) , the optical depths due to an internal photon field equals @xmath153 in the second line the transformation to the observer s frame has been applied . note that the intensity transformation only requires three powers of the doppler factor , while the transformation of the time integrated fluence requires four powers .",
    "this follows from the invariance of both @xmath154 and @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "using the requirement that @xmath156 , the minimum optical depth becomes @xmath157 there are two reasons to set the time variable in the intensity equal to the variability time scale .",
    "firstly , the intensity value at the variability time scale @xmath152 is the maximum of the lightcurve for the interesting energies , since only the highest energies of each component exhibit variability time scales as short as the light crossing time scale @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the cited minute - short variabilities are observed at the highest energies of either the synchrotron or the inverse compton component .",
    "secondly , the intensity distribution in the source at @xmath152 is a good representative of the state of the source for the entire time period since the beginning of the flare .",
    "this is especially true , if the internal retardation is taken into account .",
    "even though the electrons have considerably cooled and the emitted photons at @xmath158 are already less energetic than those emitted at the beginning of the flare , the source is still filled with the higher energetic photons from earlier times , since most of them did not have had the time to leave the source and are still available for absorption processes .",
    "this has been neglected in the preceding discussion for reasons of simplicity .",
    "the effect on the cooling process by these retarded photons will be discussed elsewhere .    in an optically thin source @xmath159 , and the resulting inequality",
    "can be solved for the doppler factor .",
    "hence , @xmath160 this is the same result as in @xcite .",
    "thus , the time - dependent injection model can not resolve the strong requirement on the doppler factor by the typical one - zone model , which is in conflict with vlbi observations where the observed lorentz factors are on the order of a few ( the so - called `` doppler factor crisis '' , e.g. @xcite , and many more ) .",
    "nevertheless , due to the severe consequences of the time - dependent injection on the spectrum and the light curves , as shown in previous papers , a wide utilization is encouraged . a combination with models that try to explain the rapid variability , such as jets - in - a - jet @xcite , magneto - centrifugal acceleration @xcite , jet - star interactions @xcite , and others , might have interesting consequences justifying further studies .",
    "in this paper the time - dependent character of the optical depth @xmath135 in blazars subject to a time - dependent injection scenario is discussed . for high energy photons the photo - pair production optical depth",
    "is calculated using the simplifying delta - function approach for the cross section . in all cases the potentially time - dependent transition energies @xmath161 between the optically thin and thick regimes",
    "are calculated satisfying the relation @xmath162 .",
    "the photo - pair production of high energy photons with a target photon field is most relevant for steady photon targets .",
    "a line - like distribution of external photons is given in this work as an example . above a certain energy threshold",
    "the source is optically thick , just as expected , with an increasing value of @xmath135 for increasing values @xmath9 of the high energy photon energies .",
    "apart from the external photons other possible target photon fields are abundant in the source , namely the synchrotron , the ssc and the ec photons produced by the relativistic electrons of the emission blob . since these target photon fields are time - dependent , some at first sight strange results emerge for the optical depth . namely , there are two solutions for the equation @xmath162 , resulting in time - dependent upper and lower energy limits for the optically thick regime",
    ". for synchrotron photons these limits are so high that only the highest energies are affected . on the other hand , these are usually beyond the cut - off energy of the high energetic component , and thus only have a minor impact .    if the limits for the optically thick regime due to an ssc target exist , they are at first at rather low energies . at later times",
    "these limits increase to higher energies .",
    "however , since the time dependence of the respective intensities imply a decreasing cut - off time for increasing energies , no more high energetic photons are produced when the source becomes optically thick for them .",
    "hence , high energy photons might leave the source while medium or low energetic photons can not .",
    "this would cause a dip in the high energy component in the mev energy regime  an energy window currently not covered by any operational telescope . this might be an interesting target for the planned astromev and gamma - light @xcite missions . on the other hand ,",
    "a non - detection of such a feature would put further constraints on the source parameters .",
    "the ec target requires extreme parameter values in order to cause some absorption .",
    "hence , absorption by ec photons can be safely ignored .",
    "to summarize , the optical depths due to the time - dependent internal photon fields is not a big issue . for purely linearly cooling sources ( i.e. @xmath45 ) the optical depth due to photo - pair production",
    "can be neglected . even for @xmath46",
    "only the ssc photons might have a visible impact on the sed , as can be seen in the example seds in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "however , even for the ssc target a high value for the parameter @xmath29 is necessary implying an unrealistically large compton dominance ( c.f .",
    "the discussion at the end of section [ sec : synssc ] ) .    with respect to the so - called `` doppler factor crisis ''",
    "the simple change in the one - zone model from continuous to time - dependent injection does not solve the problem .",
    "it might , however , be useful in combination with other models .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", the calculation of the synchrotron - self absorption optical depths is presented in appendix [ app : ssa ] .",
    "this applies for low synchrotron photon energies , and is observed in some blazars as a steeper spectrum at radio wavelengths compared to an optically thin spectrum . in such cases the synchrotron - self absorption turn - over energy could be used to constrain the parameters .",
    "the time - dependent injection model challenges this simple deduction , since the turn - over energy is not a constant any more but becomes strongly time dependent . from an initial low value the turn - over energy increases to a maximum and then decreases until the source becomes totally optically thin at low synchrotron energies . for a well sampled spectrum it might be possible to deduce the maximum energy . since it depends only on three free parameters , it would certainly help to constrain the free parameters .",
    "otherwise , precise knowledge of the time of observation with respect to the onset of the flare ( i.e. , time of injection ) is necessary in order to make any useful statement .",
    "in conclusion , the optical depth can potentially be used to constrain the free parameters , but is not a limitation to the time - dependent injection model itself .",

    "the delta - function in time might seem as a very simple form for a particle injection .",
    "it has , however , the important consequence that the particles can not reach equilibrium , which results in the non - linearity of the ssc cooling term . in equilibrium conditions ( i.e. , constant injection in time ) the non - linearity is inhibited , because the integral in equation ( [ eq : totcool ] ) yields a constant .    the derivation of the solution to equation ( [ eq : kineq1 ] ) under the given scenario has been computed by @xcite",
