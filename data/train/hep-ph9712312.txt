    "in annihilation , events containing three distinct jets of hadrons were first observed at the petra storage ring in 1979 @xcite .",
    "such events were interpreted in terms of the fundamental process @xmath0 @xmath1 , providing direct evidence for the existence of the gluon , the vector boson of qcd @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies of the properties of such events @xcite have confirmed this interpretation .",
    "many jet observables have been explored experimentally in annihilations , yielding information on qcd as well as on the electroweak theory .",
    "we here consider the orientation of the @xmath1plane or ` event plane ' @xcite in terms of the angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath4 is the polar angle of the quark direction with respect to the electron beam , and @xmath5 is the azimuthal orientation angle of the event plane with respect to the quark - electron plane , such that ( fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath6 the polar angle can also be defined in two - jet events of the type @xmath0 @xmath7 , in which case the distribution in @xmath4 is determined in the electroweak theory @xcite , and displays a c.m .  energy - dependent forward - backward asymmetry which has been observed in many experiments @xcite . for annihilation at the @xmath8 resonance ,",
    "the polar - angle asymmetry is large only if one , or both , of the beams are longitudinally polarised , as at slc / sld @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath5 is , of course , undefined in @xmath7events , but in @xmath1events , it also displays an asymmetry which can be large at the @xmath8 resonance in the case of highly polarised electrons . this azimuthal - angle distribution is currently being investigated experimentally @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denote the quark , antiquark and gluon momenta respectively ( see fig .  1 ) and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the scaled energies ( for simplicity , we consider the limit of massless quarks ) : @xmath16 h_f^{(1)}(s ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\biggl [ \\frac{3}{4}\\cos\\theta\\ , { \\d^2\\sigmap\\over \\d x\\d\\bar x}\\ ; -\\;{3\\over\\sqrt{2}}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\chi\\ , { \\d^2\\sigmaa\\over \\d x\\d\\bar x } \\biggr]h_f^{(2)}(s ) , \\label{eqfour}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where at lowest order in the electroweak theory the dependences on flavour and beam polarisation are very transparent , and given by the functions : @xmath17(v_f^2+a_f^2 ) , \\label{eqhfone } \\\\ h_f^{(2)}(s ) & = & -2q_f\\re f(s)(a\\xi - v\\xi)a_f   + |f(s)|^2[-(v^2+a^2)\\xi+2va\\xi]2v_fa_f , \\label{eqhftwo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the charge of quark flavour @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are the vector and axial vector couplings of the @xmath8 to the electron ( quark of flavour @xmath20 ) , respectively .",
    "the longitudinal beam polarisations enter through the coefficients @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the longitudinal polarisations of the electron and positron beams .",
    "several important points concerning eq .",
    "( [ eqfour ] ) should be noted .",
    "the cross - section can be written as a sum of 6 terms , each of which may be factorised into three contributions : the first factor is a simple trigonometric function of the polar and azimuthal orientation angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the second , @xmath28 ( @xmath29=u , l , t , i , p , a ) , is a function of the parton momentum fractions ; these are determined by qcd and kinematics ; the third factor , @xmath30 , is a function containing the dependence on the fermion electroweak couplings .",
    "hence , in each term there is factorisation both between the dynamical contributions of the qcd and electroweak sectors of the standard model and between the orientation of the event plane and the relative orientation of the jets within the plane .",
    "one may exploit this property by defining moments in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in order to isolate the different terms @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33 are often referred to in the literature as _ helicity cross - sections _ , and the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqfour ] ) , with six terms , each containing one of the independent helicity cross - sections , has been shown @xcite to be valid for massless partons up to  in perturbative qcd .",
    "when quark masses are introduced , each of the first four terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqfour ] ) ( proportional to @xmath34 ) gets an additional contribution proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36a_f^2,\\ ] ] and where @xmath37 is proportional to the square of the quark mass , @xmath38 .    at  in perturbative qcd @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 for the coordinate system of fig .",
    "1 the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given in @xcite , entirely in terms of ` internal ' angles of the event .",
    "since the quark and antiquark tend to have a small acollinearity angle , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 will typically be small compared with @xmath41 and @xmath46 .",
    "the results presented here are at .",
    "corresponding results at , for massless quarks , could in principle be derived from the helicity cross - section expressions given in refs .",
    "@xcite . for massive quarks",
    "the helicity cross - sections have recently been calculated at  in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in this case there are three additional cross - sections , corresponding to three new angular dependences : @xmath47 these terms are generated by absorptive parts in the scattering amplitude ; they vanish in the massless limit even at the one - loop order .",
    "thus , they are quite small . the last term , @xmath48 can also be written as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the angle between the normal to the event plane and the beam direction .",
    "we now discuss the singly - differential cross - sections in terms of @xmath31 or @xmath5 .",
    "consider integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqfour ] ) first over @xmath13 and @xmath51 , with the integration domain given by some standard jet resolution criterion @xmath52 @xcite and using the notation : @xmath53 integrating over @xmath5 we then obtain : @xmath54 where the term containing @xmath55 represents the well - known quark forward - backward asymmetry resulting from parity violation in the weak interaction , but for the three - jet case .",
    "similarly , by integrating over @xmath31 we obtain : @xmath56 where the term containing @xmath57 represents an azimuthal , parity - odd asymmetry analogous to the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eqathe ] ) but owing its existence to the radiation of the gluon .    for the case of longitudinally - polarised electrons and unpolarised positrons",
    "the dependences of these singly - differential distributions on the beam polarisation and c.m.energy are illustrated in figs .",
    "2(a , b ) and 3(a , b ) respectively .",

    "( we refer to positive ( negative ) polarisation as right- ( left- ) handed respectively . )",
    "the recent slc / sld case of @xmath61 = @xmath64 @xcite is also indicated .",
    "the quark polar - angle forward - backward asymmetry is large for high beam polarisation , and its sign changes with the sign of the polarisation .",
    "the less familiar azimuthal - angle distribution is shown in fig .",
    "2b for the same cases as in fig .  2a",
    "; the distribution is symmetric about @xmath65 .",
    "the phase change of the @xmath5 distribution when the beam polarisation sign is changed is a reflection of the sign reversal of the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath31 .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for up - type quarks , and for other values of @xmath52 .",
    "we illustrate the energy dependence of the @xmath31- and @xmath5-distributions in figs .",
    "3a and 3b , respectively , for down - type quarks at fixed electron polarisation @xmath61 = @xmath62 , with results at @xmath58 = 35 , 60 , 91 and 200 gev , corresponding to e@xmath2e@xmath3 annihilation at the petra , tristan , slc / lep and lep2 collider energies .",
    "the variation with energy is due to the varying relative contribution of @xmath66 and @xmath8 exchange in the e@xmath2e@xmath3 annihilation process .",
    "results are also shown for a possible high - energy collider operating with polarised electrons at @xmath58 = 500 gev and 2 tev .",

    "3(a , b ) would provide a significant consistency check of the standard model .",
    "( 10,4.5 ) ( 0.,-2.0 ) ( 3.,-2.5 )",
    "by analogy with the _ left - right forward - backward asymmetry _ of the polar - angle distribution : @xmath68 it is natural to define a corresponding asymmetry of the azimuthal - angle distribution @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath0 @xmath1cross - section for a left- ( l ) or right- ( r ) handed electron beam of polarisation magnitude @xmath71 .    for the case of e@xmath2e@xmath3 annihilation at the @xmath8 resonance using electrons of longitudinal polarisation @xmath61 and unpolarised positrons , as at slc , eqs .",

    "whereas both asymmetries are directly proportional to the beam polarisation @xmath71 and the electroweak coupling @xmath75 , the @xmath31 asymmetry is proportional to the helicity cross - section @xmath55 , and the @xmath5 asymmetry to the helicity cross - section @xmath57 . since the electroweak factor @xmath75 is predicted to a high degree of accuracy by the standard model , and , in the case of b and c quarks , has also been measured using predominantly @xmath7final states at slc and lep @xcite , measurement of these asymmetries ( [ eqafbboth ] ) in @xmath1events at slc / sld would allow one to probe @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",
    "preliminary results in this direction were reported recently @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the asymmetries is independent of both polarisation and electroweak couplings and depends only on the ratio of @xmath55 and @xmath57 : @xmath76 as a consequence of there being , up to  in massless perturbative qcd , only the six independent helicity cross - sections given in eq .",
    "( [ eqfour ] ) , the relations ( [ eqafbboth ] ) and ( [ eqratio ] ) are valid up to the same order .",
    "we show in fig .  4a , at  the ratios @xmath77 and @xmath78 and their dependence on @xmath52 ; the dependence is weak . for completeness",
    "we also show @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "it would be worthwhile to investigate the size of higher - order perturbative qcd contributions by evaluating these ratios at ; this should be possible using the matrix elements described in ref .",
    "@xcite or the results of @xcite .",
    "( 10,6.5 ) ( 0.,-1.0 ) ( 3.8,-1.0 )    it would be interesting to confront the theoretical predictions with experimental measurements , taking into account mass effects and higher - order qcd effects @xcite .",
    "significant deviations of the data from the predictions for the asymmetries , eqs .",
    "( [ eqafbboth ] ) , would indicate anomalous parity - violating contributions to the process @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of asymmetries , eq .  ( [ eqratio ] ) , is at lowest order independent of the electroweak coupling factor @xmath75 , and would help to unravel the dynamical origin of any such effect .",
    "all of the preceding discussions have been based on the assumption that the parton - type originator of jets is known ,  that in 3-jet events one can identify which jet originated from the quark , antiquark and gluon .",
    "the definition of @xmath31 requires that the quark jet be known , whereas the definition of @xmath5 requires that both the quark jet and a second jet origin be identified .",
    "it is difficult from an experimental point - of - view to make such exclusive identification for jets of hadrons measured in a detector .",
    "quark and antiquark jets have been identified in predominantly 2-jet events in annihilation ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "currently , one has reached a single - hemisphere efficiency for b or @xmath81 quarks of the order of 70% , and a double - tagging efficiency of about 50% .",
    "identification of both quark and antiquark jets in @xmath0 @xmath1events is  more difficult due to the greater hadronic activity .",
    "it is therefore useful to consider more inclusive quantities .",
    "two possibilities are : ( 1 ) _ semi - inclusive _ : the quark jet is assumed to be identified , and the _ least energetic _ jet in the event is taken to be the gluon and is used to define the angle @xmath5 ( eq .  ( [ eqchi ] ) ) . while this assumption will be wrong part of the time , it will be wrong by a calculable probability , and hence this can in principle be fully corrected for .",
    "( 2 ) _ fully - inclusive _ : the jets are labelled only in terms of their energies , @xmath82 ; the polar angle @xmath4 is then defined by the angle of the fastest jet w.r.t .",
    "the electron beam direction and the azimuthal angle @xmath5 can be defined analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eqchi ] ) as : @xmath83    for the semi - inclusive case we show at  the ratios @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "whereas @xmath55 and @xmath84 are unchanged relative to the exclusive case , @xmath85 and @xmath57 , which multiply terms proportional to @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eqfour ] ) , are smaller in magnitude because of the sometimes incorrect gluon - jet identification . though this implies that the parity - violating asymmetry @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ eqafbboth ] ) is smaller by a ( @xmath52-dependent ) factor of order 2 , it will in fact be easier to access experimentally because the semi - inclusive case requires only one of the quark- and antiquark - jets to be identified explicitly .",
    "in the fully - inclusive case the terms @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are odd under interchange of quark and antiquark jets , cancel out ; writing the cross - section in terms of thrust @xcite one obtains at : @xmath89 where expressions for @xmath90 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the notation @xmath91",
    "we show at  the ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 in fig .",
    "their magnitudes and dependences on @xmath52 differ relative to the exclusive and semi - inclusive cases due to the redefinition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "distributions of @xmath31 and @xmath5 in this case have already been measured and found to be in agreement with  qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "another fully - inclusive observable is the polar - angle @xmath50 of the normal to the event plane with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the differential cross - section @xmath94 has been calculated at  in massless perturbative qcd @xcite , and has been measured at @xmath95  gev @xcite and @xmath67  gev @xcite .",
    "the effects of final - state interactions can induce a term linear in @xmath96 whose sign and magnitude depend on the electron beam polarisation @xcite ; experimental limits on such a term have been set using hadronic @xmath8 decays @xcite .",
    "we have presented the orientation of @xmath0 @xmath1events in terms of the polar- ( @xmath4 ) and azimuthal- ( @xmath5 ) angle distributions .",
    "these distributions have been given at  in perturbative qcd for massless quarks and their dependence on longitudinal electron - beam polarisation and centre - of - mass energy has been illustrated .",
    "the more complicated  results are available for massless quarks @xcite and coming soon also for massive quarks @xcite .",
    "we have considered the left - right forward - backward asymmetry of the @xmath31 distribution and have presented a corresponding asymmetry of the @xmath5 distribution .",
    "parity - violating 3-jet observables of this kind represent a new search - ground for anomalous contributions and are presently being explored experimentally @xcite .    for the case of annihilation at the @xmath8 resonance using longitudinally - polarised electrons ,",
    "the @xmath31 asymmetry is proportional to the qcd helicity cross - section @xmath55 , and the @xmath5 asymmetry to the helicity cross - section @xmath57 ; these are now being measured using the highly - polarised electron beam at slc / sld .",
    "to lowest electroweak order the ratio of these asymmetries is independent of electroweak couplings and the beam polarisation .",
