    "radio emission from a pulsar is believed to originate in the open field line region of the polar cap of the neutron star .",
    "the size , shape and location of regions of radio emission in the average profiles of pulsars is thus expected to reflect the arrangement of emission regions in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "pulsar average profiles exhibit a great diversity in shape , and their classification based on the number of emission components is a useful starting point to study the emission characteristics of pulsars .",
    "rankin ( 1993 , 1990 ; and references therein ) has carried out such a detailed classification , and has come up with the conclusion that there are two kinds of emission components  core and conal  in pulsar profiles , which result from two distinct types of emission mechanisms .",
    "further , rankin proposes that the conal components arise from two nested hollow cones of emission , which along with a central core emission region , make up the complete pulsar emission beam .",
    "the actual profile observed for a given pulsar depends on the cut that the observer s line - of - sight makes through this emission beam . from the above work",
    ", rankin also concludes that core radiation originates from very close to the neutron star surface whereas the conal radiation comes from regions higher up in the magnetosphere .",
    "the outer cone is postulated to originate higher up in the magnetosphere than the inner cone , but along the same set of field lines .",
    "recent work by @xcite which compares frequency dependence of pulsar radiation features for average profiles with those for single pulses , comes up with evidence in support of such a conal beam model . a somewhat different model of the pulsar emission beam",
    "is described by @xcite who propose that the emission within the beam is patchy , i.e. the distribution of component locations within the beam is random , rather than organized in one or more hollow cones .",
    "one of the problems in resolving this conflict is related to a correct determination of the total number of emission components for a pulsar and the significance of their arrangement within the pulse window . in a recent paper ( gangadhara & gupta , 2001 ;",
    "hereafter paper i ) , we have addressed these issues with the help of a novel method of studying the emission geometry of pulsars . using the sensitive `` window - thresholding '' technique ( w - t technique hereafter ) on single pulse data for a given pulsar , we first identify all possible conal emission components in the profile that can be detected given the sensitivity of the data , and determine accurate locations in pulse longitude for these . from this",
    "we determine the total number and arrangement of emission cones in the observed profile .",
    "then , from detection of retardation and aberration effects in the locations of the conal components , we estimate the emission height for each cone . coupling this with a dipolar field geometry and the available information about the relative orientations of the spin and rotation axes of the pulsar and the line of sight , we are able to identify the field lines from which each cone originates , thereby giving a complete solution for the emission geometry for each cone . using this technique on single pulse data for psr  b0329 + 54 at two different radio frequencies",
    ", we showed in paper i that there are as many as 9 identifiable components in this pulsar , arranged in the form of 4 concentric rings around the central core component .",
    "the emission heights for the cones were found to increase systematically from inner to outer cones for a given frequency , ranging from @xmath0 160 to @xmath0 1150 km .",
    "also , for a given cone , the height was found to reduce with increasing frequency , providing direct proof of the commonly accepted `` radius to frequency mapping '' paradigm .    in this paper , we extend our study of emission geometry to another six pulsars . section 2 describes the observations and data analysis steps . in section 3",
    ", we present our results , where we are able to solve for the emission geometry for 5 of the pulsars studied , and have tentative results for the sixth . in section 4",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings for the current understanding of pulsar emission physics .",
    ".properties of the pulsars used for emission geometry studies . [ tbl1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for our study of emission geometry , we selected a set of pulsars with clearly defined properties that make it easy to apply the techniques used for psr  b0329 + 54 in paper i. these included the following criteria : ( i ) the presence of multiple emission components ( or indications thereof ) in the existing profiles ; ( ii ) the presence of a reasonably well identified core component at our frequency of observation , which was the 325 mhz band of the gmrt ; ( iii ) strong enough mean flux such that reasonable signal to noise ratio ( snr ) could be expected for single pulse observations with the incoherent array mode of the gmrt .",
    "the first two constraints above confine the selected pulsars to the category of `` triple '' or `` multiple '' pulsars as defined by @xcite , or equivalently , to the category of `` cones with cores '' pulsars , as defined by @xcite . of the possible candidates",
    ", we avoided pulsars with very wide profiles ( e.g. psr  b0826@xmath134 , psr  b1541 + 09 ) as it is not easy to unambiguously identify discrete emission components in these profiles due to the extended emission over a large fraction of the pulse period .",
    "the final list of pulsars selected for our study is given in table  [ tbl1 ] , along with relevant details .",
    "here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 refer to the standard definitions of the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes and the impact angle of the line of sight with respect to the magnetic axis , respectively .",
    "the values for these angles are taken from @xcite .",
    "these are not very different from the corresponding values given by @xcite  the typical difference for @xmath2 is @xmath0 a few degrees and that for @xmath3 is less than @xmath0 0.5 to 1.0 degree .",
    "the observations were carried out at the gmrt , in the 325 mhz band , using the incoherent array mode ( see @xcite for more details about the pulsar modes of operation of the gmrt ) .",
    "the data were obtained by incoherent addition of the dual polarization signals from 12 antennas .",
    "the bandwidth used was 16  mhz , divided into 256 spectral channels by the digital back - ends .",
    "the raw data were integrated to a time resolution of 0.516 milliseconds before being recorded for off - line analysis , where the data were dedispersed and gated to obtain the single pulse sequence for each pulsar . during this analysis , care was taken to check and flag the data for radio frequency interference signals . for a majority of the pulsars ,",
    "the centre frequency of the observations was 318 mhz ; for one case it was 328 mhz , and 333 mhz for another ( see table  [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "all of the 318 mhz observations were carried out on 10 - 11 dec 2000 . for most cases ,",
    "the total number of pulses were obtained from a single observing run .",
    "for some pulsars ( e.g. psr  b2045@xmath116 ) , data from different observing sessions ( on different days ) was combined ( after proper alignment ) to obtain the final single pulse sequence with enough pulses for subsequent analysis .",
    "the total number of pulses for each pulsar is given in column 7 of table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the average profile obtained for each pulsar is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the time resolution here is the basic sample time interval of 0.516 millisec , except for the case of psr  b2111 + 46 , where the data has been integrated by a factor of 4 , to a sample interval of 2.064 millisec .",
    "the snr obtained for the peak of the average profiles is quite good  in the range 200 to 600  resulting in single pulse peak snrs of the order to 5 to 10 and better , which are needed for using the w - t technique effectively .",
    "all the pulsars show multi - component profiles , with at least 3 or more components easily visible .",
    "the classification of each pulsar , according to the scheme proposed by rankin ( 1993 ) , is given in col .",
    "6 of table  [ tbl1 ] , where the triple ( t ) pulsars have 3 known components and the multiple ( m ) pulsars have 5 known components . from published results related to ( i ) frequency evolution of the profile components and ( ii ) polarization properties of average profiles ( e.g. rankin 1993 , lyne & manchester 1988 and references therein ) , it is clear for most of these pulsars that the central component is the core component .",
    "further , in almost all cases , it is apparent from figure  1 that the conal components are located asymmetrically with respect to the core component , with the tendency for each trailing conal component to be closer to the core than its leading counterpart .",
    "this is consistent with the expectations of retardation and aberration effects due to finite emission height of the conal beams ( e.g. paper i ) .    to carry out a detailed modeling of the geometry of the emission cones for each pulsar , we need to identify all possible emission components in the profiles , that can be determined within the snr limitations of our data . for this",
    "we have used the w - t technique described by us in paper i , where we employed this technique to identify as many as 9 emission components in psr  b0329 + 54 . in this technique ,",
    "we set a window in a desired pulse longitude range and employ an intensity threshold to select the single pulses that go to make an average profile , which we refer to as a `` w - t profile '' .",
    "we consider all those pulses which have emissions above the threshold within the window . as a result of",
    "this averaging of selected pulses , emission components within the window improve in snr compared to other parts of the profile and are thus more easily detected in the w - t profile .",
    "as described in paper i , we use a few different checks to ensure that the detected components are genuine .",
    "usually , the window size and location are varied by a few bins while checking that the component shows up at the same location ( this is not always possible to do for components that are located in close proximity to known , strong components ) .",
    "in addition , the selection threshold is varied over a reasonable range to check the persistence of the component , and to minimize picking up contributions from random noise .",
    "these checks are robust enough to avoid detection of spurious components by chance accumulations in the selected window .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the w - t technique does _ not _ detect any new components when applied to off - pulse regions of the profile .    using the w - t technique ,",
    "we have been able to detect new emission components in most of the pulsars studied here , as well as get accurate estimates for the locations of the existing components .",
    "the total number of _ new _ components detected for each pulsar is given in column 8 of table 1 .",
    "some typical examples of detection of components ( new as well as known ones ) are illustrated in the sample of w - t profiles shown in figure  2 . here ,",
    "2(a ) & 2(e ) show examples of clear and easy detections ( usually of already known components ) ; figs .",
    "2(b),2(d ) & 2(g ) illustrate detection of new , weak components and figs .",
    "2(c ) , 2(f ) & 2(i ) are cases of detections of new components located in close proximity to known , strong components . in some cases",
    ", we were able to increase the confidence of our detections by integrating the data to a larger time constant ( 2 to 4 times the original sampling rate ) and repeating the w - t analysis , albeit with a loss in resolution of the location of the component peak .",
    "this was particularly useful in cases where the original pulse profile is relatively broad and well sampled ( e.g. psr  b2111 + 46 ) and the snr is marginal for the weaker emission components .    in some cases",
    ", we detect likely candidates for new emission components but can not confirm them with enough confidence from our data set .",
    "this is due to limitations of either ( i ) inadequate snr , ( ii ) not enough pulses for the weak components to show up reliably often enough or ( iii ) very close proximity of the suspected component to a known component , especially when the latter is a strong component . in such cases ,",
    "we label the component detection as `` tentative '' .",
    "we mention this specifically for each pulsar when we discuss the individual results .",
    "to determine accurate locations in pulse longitude for each component of a pulsar , we take the corresponding w - t profile and fit a gaussian curve to the selected component . the noise contribution to each data point",
    "is estimated from the off - pulse noise r.m.s .",
    "of the w - t profile .",
    "the peak of the best - fit gaussian is taken as the best estimate of the location of the component and the 1-sigma error estimate on this peak is used to derive the error in the location of the component .",
    "for the sample detections shown in figure 2 , we also show the best fit gaussian to the component detected within the w - t window . for most cases ,",
    "we get quite good fits , with values for the reduced chi - square @xmath0 1.0 .",
    "the error estimates are generally found to be proportional to the snr of the fitted component , which is as expected .    from our determination of the total number of the emission components , we resolve the emission geometry for each pulsar as consisting of a central core component and one or more cones of emission around it . from our best estimates of the locations of these components",
    ", we then solve for the emission heights of the cones , as well as for the transverse location of the emitting field lines on the polar cap , using the technique described in paper i. the polar cap location of the field lines is quantified by the ratio of the distance to the `` foot '' of the field line ( from the magnetic pole ) to the distance to the `` foot '' of the last open field line in the magnetosphere ",
    "the parameter   of paper i ( in this description , the foot of the field line is the point where the field line intersects the neutron star surface ) .",
    "the results from our analysis of the 6 pulsars are summarized in tables 2 to 7 .",
    "the table for each pulsar gives , for every emission cone that we detect ( including the known ones ) , the following information :  &   , the location ( with respect to location of the core component ) of the leading and trailing emission components that constitute the cone ( columns 2 and 3 ) ; , the inferred retardation plus aberration angle ( column 4 ) ; , the inferred half angle of the conal beam ( column 5 ) ; , the computed emission height for the cone ( column 6 ) ; and , the polar cap location of the associated field lines ( column 7 ) .",
    "the emission heights of the cones are given in kilometers , as well as fraction of the light cylinder radius ( ) in column 6 .",
    "the errors for the derived quantities ( columns 4 to 7 ) are determined from appropriate propagation of the errors on the estimates of the emission component locations ( including that for the core component ) , and do not include any effects of possible errors in the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we first discuss the results for individual pulsars and present a general summary of the results at the end of this section .",
    "this pulsar shows a 3 component profile for frequencies below about 1 ghz and is interpreted as a typical triple ( core and one conal pair ) pulsar ( e.g. rankin 1993 ) .",
    "however , this classification is not completely unambiguous . though the frequency evolution of the components ( e.g. gould , 1994 ) appears to indicate that the central component is a core , the polarization characteristics do not show clear , unambiguous evidence of core radiation for this component . at our frequency",
    ", the profile shows a fairly wide emission region around the central peak , especially on the trailing side ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the w - t analysis readily localises the leading and trailing components in the profile .",
    "however , in the central 10 to 15 degrees of pulse longitude we get unclear and conflicting results .",
    "the w - t analysis shows evidence for multiple emission peaks in this region ( e.g. at @xmath14.1and 3 ) , but these are generally not found to be stable against variations of window widths and thresholds .",
    "hence , it is difficult to unambiguously identify distinct emission components in the central region , including a clear identification of the reference core component .",
    "it is possible that what we are seeing in this region is a somewhat tangential cut through the edge of an inner emission cone , and that the core , if present at all , is a weak component in this region .",
    "this would be consistent with the fact that this pulsar has a relatively large value of the impact parameter @xmath3  it is the largest amongst all the pulsars studied here ( table 1 ) .",
    "the entry in column 8 of table 1 for this pulsar reflects our uncertainty in the identification of new emission components .    using a tentative identification of the core as the peak produced by setting a wide window in the central region",
    ", we get the locations of the main leading and trailing emission components with respect to the core as @xmath18.79and + 6.76 , respectively .",
    "in addition , there is some evidence from our analysis for the presence of weak components in the leading and trailing wings of the profile , but these can not be confirmed with the quality of our data .",
    "solving for a single emission cone for this pulsar , the emission height and polar cap location are obtained as 310 km ( 1.2% of ) and 0.56 respectively ( see table  [ tbl_0450 ] ) .",
    "we note that the results for this pulsar should be treated with caution , as the emission geometry is probably more complicated than what we present .",
    "the typical average profile for this well studied pulsar clearly shows 5 emission components with the central one known to be the core component .",
    "the centers of both cones are clearly offset to earlier longitudes than the core , as would be expected due to retardation and aberration .",
    "our analysis reveals the presence of two more emission components , located between the core and the inner conal ring .",
    "of these two , the component on the leading side ( at @xmath12.12 ) is seen relatively easily in our analysis ( fig .",
    "2b ) , whereas the one on the trailing side ( at + 1.56 ) is somewhat harder to detect .",
    "this is because it is located in the relatively narrower region between the core and the trailing component of the inner cone .",
    "we therefore interpret this pulsar as having 3 emission cones around the core component , with each cone clearly showing retardation and aberration effects . solving for the locations of the emission cones at 318 mhz gives heights of 180 , 460 and 600 km ( 0.3% , 0.7% and 0.9% of   respectively ) and transverse locations on the polar cap of 0.33 , 0.41 and 0.59 ( see table  [ tbl_1237 ] ) .",
    "the average profile for this pulsar shows a core dominated triple component emission beam at 318 mhz ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the conal components , located at @xmath113.75and + 10.94 , clearly exhibit retardation - aberration effects . even though the snr is not very good , there are indications of extra emission components between the core and the known conal components . with some difficulty",
    ", our analysis picks up a component at @xmath16.07from the core and one at + 8.2on the trailing side ( figs .",
    "2c & 2d ) .",
    "in addition , we have marginal detections of two more conal components , at @xmath110.25and + 4.61 .",
    "these last two are detected with fairly low thresholds in the w - t technique and are , at best , tentative detections , requiring confirmation with higher sensitivity observations .",
    "analysis of the data after further integration by a factor of 2 were used to confirm the presence of these components .",
    "our final result for this pulsar is a detection of 3 cones for which the emission heights at 318 mhz are obtained as 290 , 410 and 570 km ( 0.8% , 1.2% and 1.6% of   respectively ) , and polar cap locations are obtained as 0.43 , 0.57 and 0.63 respectively ( see table  [ tbl_1821 ] ) .",
    "this is a well known multi - component ( m - type ) pulsar , where the typical profile at meter wavelengths readily shows 4 components and has clear indications of a fifth component located close to the leading edge of the central , core component ( see fig .",
    "2e for our detection of this component ) .",
    "our analysis easily gives the locations for these 5 known components .",
    "in addition , we see evidence for two more outer components , located near the leading and trailing edges of the profile , at @xmath123.73and + 19.95with respect to the core ( see fig .",
    "2f for one of these ) .",
    "we label these two as tentative detections , as the threshold and number of contributing pulses are rather small ( though the analysis of data integrated by a factor of 2 supports these detections ) .",
    "further , there are hints of emission components in between the known conal components , but these can not be confirmed with the quality of our data .",
    "we thus have 5 confirmed components ( along with 2 tentative ones ) for this pulsar , leading to an interpretation of core and 2 emission cones ( and a tentative third outer cone ) . the emission heights ( at 318 mhz ) for these 3 cones",
    "are found to be 220 , 480 and 690 km ( 0.8 , 1.7 and 2.4 % of ) and polar cap locations of 0.61 , 0.69 and 0.74 ( table  [ tbl_1857 ] ) .",
    "this well known pulsar shows a 3 component profile where the central core component is clearly asymmetrically located with respect to the centre of the conal ring .",
    "this is an indication of significant aberration and retardation effects for the emission cone . on using the w - t technique , we are able to detect 3 more emission components , located in the `` saddle '' regions between the core and the known conal components , at longitudes of @xmath17.2 , @xmath15.5and + 3.06with respect to the core ( see fig .  2 g for an example of one of these )",
    "this gives a total of 5 conal components , leaving us with the somewhat difficult situation of a probable undetected conal component , which needs to be located in the narrow valley between the core and the already known trailing conal component .",
    "there are some indications of an emission component at + 4.0 , but we can not determine this unambiguously from our analysis , as it is too close to the known component at + 4.59 . lacking this , we have the problem of deciding which of the 3 new conal components is the odd one out .",
    "if we take the components at @xmath15.5and + 3.06as forming the second conal ring , the solutions for the two rings are : emission heights at 1240 and 2230 km ( 1.3 and 2.4 % of ) and polar cap locations of 0.28 and 0.32  this is the solution listed in table  [ tbl_2045 ] .",
    "alternatively , taking the components at @xmath17.2and + 3.06as forming the second conal ring changes the emission height estimate for this cone from 1240 km to 2090 km and the polar cap location shifts from 0.28 to 0.22 .",
    "we believe the first option is more likely to be the real situation .",
    "this pulsar shows a very wide but clearly triple profile with a dominant core component at meter wavelengths ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the location of the conal components is clearly asymmetric with respect to the core , showing retardation - aberration effects . for this pulsar",
    "two data sets , one taken at 318 mhz in december 2000 and another taken at 333 mhz in february 2002 were available . since the data from february 2002 had better snr and more number of pulses , all the results presented here are from the analysis of this data set .",
    "analysis of the december 2000 data produced results which are similar to those reported here , and well within the errors of the measurements .",
    "since the profile is very wide , the data were averaged to 4 times the original time resolution of 0.516 millisec , to improve the snr for the w - t analysis .",
    "besides confirming the location of the main components , our w - t analysis picks up 2 additional conal components , located at @xmath118.71and + 14.91with respect to the core ( see figs .",
    "2h & 2i ) .",
    "in addition , there are hints of another pair of components located at the leading and trailing edges of the profile ( at approximately @xmath148.3and + 38.7with respect to the core ) , but we are unable to confirm them clearly . hence we confine ourselves to 2 cones of emission around the central core component , for this pulsar",
    ". the estimates for the emission heights at 333 mhz are 1360 km and 2080 km ( 2.8 and 4.3 % of ) , while the values for the polar cap locations are 0.22 and 0.31 ( see table  [ tbl_2111 ] ) .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) all the 6 pulsars show clear signatures of an asymmetry of the cones with respect to the core radiation , in that the centers of the cones occur at earlier pulse longitudes , with respect to the location of the core . for a given pulsar , the magnitude of the effect increases from inner to outer cones .",
    "\\(ii ) interpreting the shift of the cone centers as the effect of retardation and aberration on the emitted conal beam leads to reasonable values for the emission heights . these range from about 200 km to 2200 km over all the 6 pulsars . in terms of the light cylinder distance ,",
    "this range is from 0.3% to 4.3% of . for a given pulsar ,",
    "the heights are found to increase systematically from the inner to the outer cones ( though in some cases the sizes of the error bars prevent this from being made a firm conclusion ) .",
    "\\(iii ) combining the emission height estimates with a dipole field line geometry results in estimates of the transverse polar cap locations of the foot of the field lines that each cone is radiated from .",
    "these are found to vary from about 0.22 to 0.74 of the radial distance to the last open field line from the magnetic axis .",

    "there are several interesting aspects of pulsar emission geometry that can be addressed by our study .",
    "firstly , it should be clear from this work ( and paper i ) that it is not sufficient to study only the average profiles to understand the emission geometry .",
    "we have shown that a careful analysis of good quality single pulse data can provide valuable extra information about the emission geometry .",
    "it would be almost impossible to detect some of the emission components we have detected , using other techniques such as fitting multiple gaussians to the average profile . here",
    ", the window - thresholding method used by us comes in as a handy tool to find components that are weak and/or emit intermittently , or those which are located close to other strong components . using this , we find that most triple and multiple component pulsars can be shown to have 5 or 7 components .",
    "it is then likely that most pulsars , when observed with sufficient quality data , are going to show multiple emission cones around the central core component .",
    "further , a careful identification of the emission components appears , almost invariably , to support the picture of a core beam plus multiple , concentric conal beams of emission , in that the conal components turn out to be arranged in equal numbers on either side of the core .",
    "what is even more interesting is that in all cases , there is an asymmetry in the location of the core with respect to the centers of the cones , and that too always in the same sense of having the cone centers advanced with respect to the core component location .",
    "though we have presented the detailed analysis for only a handful of pulsars , this trend is easily visible in a vast majority of pulsars that have clearly defined core and conal emission components .",
    "a check of the data from different sources in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; the epn database ) reveals several clear cases : psrs  b0105 + 68 , b1700@xmath132 , b1737 + 13 , b1826@xmath117 , b1916 + 14 , b1946 + 35 , b2002 + 31 & b2003@xmath108 ( detailed studies of several such pulsars have been initiated and will be reported upon shortly ) .",
    "thus it would seem that this is a fairly universal trend among pulsars that show clear core and conal emission components , and our interpretation of this as being due to retardation - aberration effects in the magnetosphere , is a reasonable one .",
    "the emission heights that we obtain for the different pulsars have very plausible values . for psrs",
    "b0450@xmath118 , b1237 + 35 , b1821 + 05 and b1857@xmath126 , we obtain emission heights in the range of 200 to 700 km , while for psrs  b2045@xmath116 and b2111 + 46 , the values range from 1200 to 2200 km .",
    "typical estimates of emission heights reported in literature are a few 100 km for most pulsars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "rankin ( 1993 ) estimates the emission heights for the cones from the measured half - power widths of the conal component pairs and making the assumption that the cones are radiated from near the last open field lines of the polar cap . this yields 1 ghz height estimates of about 130 and 220 km for the two cones .",
    "our height estimates will naturally be larger than these as we find that the emission is located on field lines that are well inside of the last open field line : a cone of the same angular width radiated from inner field lines has to come from a greater height in the magnetosphere . specifically , for psrs  b1237 + 25 and b1857@xmath126 , rankin(1993 ) gives estimates of emission heights for the cones at a range of frequencies . comparing with the values at the nearby frequency of 270 mhz ( table 3 of rankin , 1993 ) , we find that our estimates for the same cone at 318 mhz are more than twice as large .",
    "if , however , the estimates of rankin ( 1993 ) are corrected for emitting field line with @xmath5 ( as postulated in @xcite ) , then the results are in better agreement with ours .",
    "our emission height estimates are closer to those obtained by kijak & gil ( 1997,1998 ) , though still somewhat larger .",
    "we note that the height estimates for psrs  b2045@xmath116 and b2111 + 46 are somewhat unusually large . correspondingly , these two pulsars also have rather small values for the polar cap locations of the radiating field lines , as compared to the lower emission height pulsars .",
    "the reason for these larger heights is not clear . as a fraction of the light cylinder radius distance ,",
    "however , all these heights are still quite small , being @xmath0 5% of   at the largest .",
    "this also means that effects of magnetic field sweepback ( see paper i ) can safely be ignored for all these cases .",
    "strictly speaking , all our height estimates are heights of the cones _ relative to that of the core radiation _ , as the retardation - aberration of the cone centers is measured with the core component as reference . since the core radiation is thought to originate very close to the neutron star surface ( e.g. rankin , 1993 & 1990 ) , these are good estimates for the actual emission heights of the cones above the neutron star surface ( the extra height of 10 km for the radius of the neutron star is much smaller than our typical error bars ) .",
    "however , if this assumption about the height of the core emission beam is not correct , then the height of the core emission has to be added to the height estimates we have reported for the cones  in this sense , our results can be taken as lower limits to the actual emission heights .",
    "the other effect of a finite core height will be to cause the inferred polar location of the cones to become somewhat smaller ( see eqn .",
    "15 of paper i ) , with the fractional change diminishing progressively from inner to outer cones . for example , an emission height of 100 km for the core radiation of psr  b1237 + 25 would cause the polar cap locations of the cones to reduce to 0.26 , 0.37 and 0.55 from their present values of 0.33 , 0.41 and 0.59 . in any case",
    ", it is quite clear from our results that the core emission originates at heights that are substantially ( @xmath0 100s of km ) less than that for the cones  otherwise we would not see any relative retardation - aberration effects between the core and cones .    another interesting feature of the results is that they are quite self - consistent with radio emission originating within the open field line region of the magnetosphere , in that we do not obtain results for polar cap locations that are greater than 1.0 .",
    "this can happen in principle , as the emission height estimate is completely independent of the width of the cone , whereas both these parameters are relevant for the calculation of the polar cap location ( see eqns . 9 and 15 of paper i ) .",
    "polar cap locations greater than 1.0 can result if the emission height estimates are less than the current results by factors of 4 to 16 . in a sense then , this argues that our interpretation of component location asymmetries as being due to retardation - aberration effects is a sensible interpretation .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result from this work is that the different cones for a pulsar originate on different sets of field lines in the magnetosphere .",
    "clearly , all the conal radiation does _ not _ originate near the last open field line region .",
    "in fact , it appears that a significant fraction of the polar cap region may be active in the generation of the multiple conal beams .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that this activity is confined along distinct and concentric rings on the polar cap . generally ,",
    "it is thought ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that this activity may be produced by spark discharges in vacuum gaps formed immediately above the neutron star surface .",
    "for such a model , our results indicate that the sparks are confined to concentric rings on the polar cap .",
    "we note that there are recent reports of inference of such patterns of circulating sparks for pulsars with conal - single geometries showing drifting sub - pulses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our results tend to support a similar conclusion for multi - component pulsars with more central traverses of the observing line - of - sight . for our pulsars",
    ", we can actually constrain the radii of these rings , via the   parameter . for a 10 km radius neutron star with a period of p seconds ,",
    "the radial size of the polar cap is just @xmath6 meters . for three concentric conal rings anchored to field lines at   = 0.33 , 0.41 and 0.59 ( as in psr  b1237 + 25 )",
    ", this translates to ring radii of 41 , 51 and 73 meters .",
    "similar numbers ( @xmath0 a few to several tens of meters ) are obtained for other pulsars also .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that we can infer the presence of features of this size on the polar cap .",
    "@xcite have recently proposed a model for pulsar radiation that invokes concentric rings of sparks to explain the observed properties of pulsar radiation . in their theory , the separation between concentric rings of sparks , very close to the neutron star surface , is of the order of _ h _ , the height of the vacuum gap .",
    "they estimate the value of _ h _ to be of the order of 10 meters for pulsars with period @xmath0 1 second , which is quite similar to the typical separation of rings that we infer .",
    "for example , for psr  b1237 + 25 , the separation between first and second rings is 10 meters and that between the second and third is 22 meters . for psr  b1821",
    "+ 05 , these numbers are 23 and 12 meters respectively ; for psr  b1857@xmath126 , they are 15 and 9 meters .",
    "thus our results make interesting connections with some of the existing theoretical models and support the idea of concentric rings of sparks circulating on the polar cap as being the cause of the radio radiation .",
    "although the activity that is the ultimate source of the radio radiation that we observe may be occurring very close to the neutron star surface , the final radiation that we see appears to originate at significant heights in the magnetosphere .",
    "further , we have shown that the inner cones are emitted at lower altitudes and outer cones at progressively higher altitudes .",
    "in addition , it is generally accepted that the same cone is emitted at higher heights at lower frequencies .",
    "clearly , all this is pointing to the requirement of the appropriate combination of parameters at specific points in the magnetosphere for the plasma disturbance to produce a beam of radiation that can be seen along our line of sight through the magnetosphere .",
    "this could be a combination of physical and geometrical parameters that contrive to give the right conditions at specific points in the magnetosphere .",
    "the localisation of the emitting regions achieved by the kind of work reported here and in paper i should help in better constraining the parameter space and thus help the theories trying to find the correct explanation for the generation of the radio waves .",
    "using the window - thresholding technique to analyse single pulse data from observations in the 325 mhz band of the gmrt , we have conducted a detailed analysis of the emission geometry of 6 radio pulsars that have prominent , multiple - component profiles .",
    "we have been able to detect new emission components in almost all of the pulsars . in some cases , we report tentative detections of weak components that need further confirmation studies .",
    "it thus looks likely that many multiple component pulsars may have at least 5 to 7 components .",
    "the total number and location of the emission components we detect clearly supports a picture of multiple conal beams around a central core beam for these pulsars ( and are a pointer to the possibility that most pulsars may have such an emission beam structure ) .",
    "further , for all cases of conal emission , we find that the cone centre is offset to earlier longitudes with respect to the location of the core , and this effect increases in magnitude from the innermost to the outermost cones for every pulsar .",
    "it appears this effect may be present in most pulsars that have clear core and conal emission geometries .",
    "we interpret this effect as being due to retardation and aberration of the conal emission beams in the magnetosphere of the pulsar . from this",
    ", we are able to solve for the emission geometry and estimate the emission height for each cone and also the polar cap location of the field lines associated with the cone , following the technique developed in gangadhara & gupta ( 2001 ) .",
    "we find emission height estimates in the range of 200 to 700 km for four pulsars ",
    "psrs  b0450@xmath118 , b1237 + 25 , b1821 + 05 and b1857@xmath126  and 1200 to 2200 km for two others ",
    "psrs  b2045@xmath116 and b2111 + 46 . in terms of the light cylinder distance ,",
    "the emission altitudes range from 0.3% to 4.3% .",
    "the estimates for the polar cap location of the radiating field lines lines come out to be in the range 0.22 to 0.74 of the distance to the last open field line , from the magnetic axis .",
    "further , for every pulsar with multiple cones , the emission altitude and the polar cap location are found to increase systematically from the innermost to the outermost cone .",
    "mapping the locations of the field lines associated with each cone , on to the neutron surface , gives concentric rings with radii of the order of a few to several tens of meters and spacings between adjacent rings of about 10 to 20 meters .",
    "our results thus tend to support a model of concentric rings of sparks produced in the vacuum gap region just above the neutron surface ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the fairly precise localization of emission regions that we have reported should provide additional information for constraining the parameter space for theories and models of radio emission mechanisms .",
