    "solar cycle 23 was predicted to reach a maximum in early 2000 @xcite , with severe geomagnetic storms expected between 1999 and 2005 . however , this cycle had modest activity compared to the previous two cycles ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "our work was motivated by the publicity associated with this solar cycle because of the relatively high level of solar activity exhibited through flares in 2003 october and november .",
    "balasubramaniam & regan ( 1994 ) showed that the temporal behavior of solar flares was similar to a sunspot butterfly diagram , with a typical 11-year cycle .",
    "our interest in predicting magnetic activity cycles associated with other cool stars ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) led us to investigate the long - term behavior of the solar cycle .",
    "earlier analyses of the sunspot cycle have been summarized by @xcite and @xcite , and a review of the long - term solar cycle was presented by @xcite .    in 1843 , heinrich schwabe reported that he had identified a possible 10-year periodicity in the pattern of sunspots based on his 17-year study of the sun from 18261843 @xcite .",
    "( note the typographical error in @xcite that the result was based on a 43-year study . ) in 1848 , rudolph wolf introduced the relative sunspot number ( r ) and organized a program of daily observations of sunspots .",
    "he reanalyzed all earlier data and found that the average length of a solar cycle was about 11 yrs . for more than two centuries , solar physicists have applied a variety of techniques to determine the nature of the solar cycle .",
    "the earliest methods involved counting sunspot numbers and determining durations of cyclic activity from sunspot minimum to minimum using the `` smoothed monthly mean sunspot number '' @xcite .",
    "the `` group sunspot number '' introduced by @xcite is a better documented data set than the database of relative sunspot numbers , but the two data sets since 1882 are virtually identical @xcite .    since 1874",
    ", sunspot areas have been measured in terms of the total surface area of the solar disk covered by sunspots at a given time @xcite .",
    "the analysis of sunspot numbers or sunspot areas is often referred to as a one - dimensional approach because there is only one independent variable , namely sunspot numbers or areas @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced a new parameter called the `` sunspot unit area '' in an effort to combine the information about the sunspot numbers and sunspot areas to derive the length of the cycle .",
    "there is also a two - dimensional approach in which the latitude of an observed sunspot is introduced as a second independent variable @xcite .",
    "when sunspots first appear on the solar surface they tend to originate at latitudes around 40 degrees and migrate toward the solar equator .",
    "when such migrant activity is taken into account it can be shown that there is an overlap between successive cycles , since a new cycle begins while its predecessor is still decaying .",
    "this overlap became obvious when @xcite published his butterfly diagram and demonstrated the latitude drift of sunspots throughout the cycles .",
    "maunder s butterfly diagram showed that although the length of time between sunspot minima is on average 11 years , successive cycles actually overlap by @xmath0 1 to 2 years .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that there were distinct solar cycles lasting 10 years as well as 12 years .",
    "this type of behavior suggests that there could be a cyclic pattern in the length of the sunspot cycle .",
    "sunspot number data collected prior to the 1700 s show epochs in which there were almost no sunspots visible on the solar surface .",
    "one such epoch , known as the maunder minimum , occurred between the years 1642 and 1705 , during which the number of sunspots recorded were very low in comparison to later epochs @xcite .",
    "other studies include the analysis of geophysical data and tree - ring radiocarbon data , which contained residual traces of solar activity @xcite , to determine if the maunder period truly had a lower number of sunspots or whether it was simply a period in which little data were collected or large degrees of errors existed . while the data collected before the 1700 s are typically less reliable than those collected in more recent times , the timing of the maunder minimum is still relatively accurate because of the correlation with geophysical data .",
    "other epochs of minimum solar activity in the past have been noted , such as the oort minimum from 1010 - 1050 , the wolf minimum from 1280 - 1340 , the sprer minimum from 1420 - 1530 @xcite , and the dalton minimum from 1795 - 1823 @xcite .",
    "these minima have been derived from historical sunspot records , auroral histories @xcite , and physical models linking dendrochronologically dated radiocarbon concentrations to the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "currently , the fine details of a given solar cycle can be predicted accurately only after a cycle has begun ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ; and many others ) because many solar cycle models require information about the starting time and rise time as well as the shape and amplitude of the cycle .",
    "most of these models have focussed on the analysis of the international sunspot numbers of as many previous cycles as possible in order to predict the pattern for the current cycle .",
    "however , none of these models includes a discussion of the variations in the length of the cycle , which has been known to vary from @xmath07 to 17 years .",

    ", we applied classical one - dimensional techniques to rederive the periodicities of solar activity using the sunspot number and area data to provide internal consistency in our analysis of the long - term behavior .",
    "these results were used as a basis in the study of the long - term behavior of the cycle length . in ",
    "2 we discussed the source of the data ; in  3 we described the derivation of the cycle from sunspot numbers and sunspot areas using two independent techniques ; in  4 we examined the variability in the cycle length based on the times of cycle minima and maxima using two independent techniques ; and in  5 we discussed the results .",
    "the sunspot data were collected from archival sources that catalog sunspot numbers , sunspot areas , as well as the measured length of the sunspot cycle .",
    "the sunspot number data , ranging from 1700 - 2005 , were archived by the national geophysical data center ( ngdc ) .",
    "these data are listed in individual sets of daily , monthly , and yearly numbers .",
    "the relative sunspot number , r , is defined as r = k ( 10 g + s ) , where g is the number of sunspot groups , s is the total number of distinct spots , and the scale factor k ( usually less than unity ) depends on the observer and is `` intended to effect the conversion to the scale originated by wolf '' @xcite .",
    "the scale factor was 1 for the original wolf sunspot number calculation .",
    "the spot number data sets are tabulated in table 1 and plotted in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the sunspot area data , beginning in 1874 may 9 , were compiled by the royal greenwich observatory from a small network of observatories @xcite . in 1976 ,",
    "the united states air force began compiling its own database from its solar optical observing network ( soon ) .",

    "we have analyzed the compiled daily sunspot areas as well as their monthly and yearly sums .",
    "the sunspot area data sets were tabulated in table 1 and plotted in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "since the sunspot number and area data were collected in different ways and by different groups , there may be subtle inherent differences between the two data sets .",
    "however , these differences should reveal themselves when the data are analyzed .",
    "the sunspot number cycle data were tabulated by the ngdc @xcite and are discussed further in  4 .",
    "these data span dates from 1610 to 2000 ( table 2 ) .",

    "the errors in the averages were determined using standard techniques @xcite . while the errors for the sunspot area results are smaller than those for the spot numbers , the area data are actually less accurate than the sunspot number data because the measurement error in the areas may be as high as 30% @xcite .",
    "the higher errors for the area data are related to the difficulty in determining a precise spot boundary .",
    "longer periodicities that could not be eliminated because of relationships with the duration of the data set or other frequencies related to the data ( as described in  3.1 ) , were also identified with durations ranging from @xmath090  260 years ( figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) .",
    "these long - term periodicities are discussed further in the following section .",
    "the previous analysis of sunspot data provided some evidence of long term cycles in the sunspot data .",
    "this secular behavior was studied in greater detail through an analysis of the dates of sunspot minima and maxima from 1610 to 2000 tabulated by the ngdc @xcite .",
    "since there have been many concerns about the difficulty in deriving the exact times of minima , and the even greater complexity in the determination of sunspot maxima , we derived our results independently using the cycle minima as well as from the cycle maxima .",
    "the sunspot cycle lengths were derived by the ngdc from the dates of successive cycle minima .",
    "in addition , we have used their tabulated dates of cycle maxima to calculate the corresponding cycle lengths .",
    "these cycle lengths are tabulated in table 2 and plotted in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the data in figure 5 show substantial variability over time .",
    "the cycle lengths derived from the dates of sunspot minima and maxima were analyzed to search for periodicities in the cycle length using two techniques : ( i ) a median trace analysis and ( ii ) a power spectrum analysis of the ` observed minus calculated ' or ( o - c ) residuals .",
    "a median trace is a plot of the median value of the data contained within a bin of a chosen width , for all bins in the data set @xcite .",
    "the median trace analysis depends on the choice of an optimal interval width ( oiw ) .",
    "these oiws , @xmath30 , were calculated using three statistical methods based on theoretical arguments used routinely to estimate the statistical density function of the data .",
    "the first method defines the oiw as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the number of data points and @xmath33 , a statistically robust measure of the standard deviation of the data , is defined as    @xmath34    where @xmath11 is the sample median .",
    "the second method defines the oiw as @xmath35 a third definition of the oiw is given by @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the interquartile range of the data set .",
    "optimal bin widths were determined for three data sets corresponding to the cycle lengths derived from the ( i ) cycle minima , ( ii ) cycle maxima , and ( iii ) the combined minima and maxima data .",
    "table 4 lists the solutions for the optimal interval widths ( @xmath38 ) for each data set .",
    "since the values of the optimal bin widths ranged from @xmath060  120 years , we tested the impact of different bin widths on our results .",
    "this procedure was limited by the fact that only 35 sunspot number cycles have elapsed since 1610 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the data set can be increased to 70 points if we analyze the combined values of the length of the solar cycle derived from both the sunspot minima and the sunspot maxima . using our derived oiws as a basis for our analysis",
    ", we calculated median traces for bin widths of 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , and 90 years .",
    "these are illustrated in figure [ f6 ] .",
    "the lower bin widths were included to make maximum use of the limited number of data points , and the higher bin widths were excluded because , once binned , there would be too few data points to make those analyses meaningful .",
    "figure [ f6 ] shows the binned data ( median values ) and the sinusoidal fits to the binned data .",
    "the least absolute error method @xcite was used to produce the sinusoidal fits to the median trace in each frame of the figure .",
    "these sinusoidal fits illustrate the long - term cyclic behavior in the length of the sunspot number cycle .",
    "the optimal solution was determined by identifying the fits that satisfied two criteria : ( 1 ) the cycle periods deduced from the three data sets should be nearly the same , and ( 2 ) the cyclic patterns should be in phase for the three data sets .",
    "table 5 lists the derived cycle periods for all three data sets : the ( a ) cycle minima , ( b ) cycle maxima , and ( c ) combined minima and maxima data .",
    "lccccc cycle minima & 35 & 97.4 &  103.9 & 75.4 & 116.6 + cycle maxima & 35 & 97.0 &  103.4 & 75.1 & 115.4 + combined & 70 & 97.3 &  82.4 & 63.5 & 91.8      the lengths of the sunspot number cycles tabulated by the national geophysical data center ( table 2 & figure [ f5 ] ) show that the basic sunspot number cycle is an average of ( 11.0 @xmath1 1.5 ) years based on the cycle minima and ( 11.0 @xmath1 2.0 ) years based on the cycle maxima .",
    "this schwabe cycle varies over a range from 8 to 15 years if the cycle lengths are derived from the time between successive minima , while the range increases to 7 to 17 years if the cycle lengths are derived from successive maxima .",
    "these variations may be significant even though the data in figure [ f5 ] show _ heteroskedasticity _ , i.e. , variability in the standard deviation of the data over time .",
    "although the range in sunspot cycle durations is large , the cycle length converged to a mean of 11 years , especially after 1818 as the accuracy of the data became more reliable .",
    "in particular , the sunspot number cycle lengths from 1610 - 1750 show a wide range of variance while the cycle durations since 1818 show a much smaller variance ( figure [ f5 ] ) .",
    "this variance may be influenced by the difficulty in identifying the dates of cycle minima and maxima whenever the sunspot activity is relatively low .",
    "even after the data became more accurate there was still a significant @xmath1 1.5-year range about the 11-year mean .",
    "the range in the length of this cycle suggests that there may be a hidden longer - term variability in the schwabe cycle .",
    "our median trace analysis of the lengths of the sunspot number cycle uncovered a long - term cycle with a duration between 146 and 419 years ( table 5 ) , if the data are binned in groups of 40 to 90 years ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "since the median trace analysis is influenced by the bin size of the data , we determined the optimal bin width based on the goodness of fit between the median trace and the corresponding sinusoidal fit ( see figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "based on the sunspot minima ( the best data set ) , the cycle length was 185 years for the 50-yr bin width , 243 years for the 60-yr bin , 222 years for the 70-yr bin , 393 years for the 80-year bin , and 299 years for the 90-yr bin ; so we found no direct relationship between the bin size and the resulting periodicity .",
    "figure [ f6 ] also shows the median traces for the data and illustrates that the optimal bin width is in the range of 50 - 60 years because it is only in these two cases that the sinusoidal fits are in phase and the derived periods are approximately equal for all three data sets .",
    "the 50-year median trace predicts a 183-year sunspot number cycle , while the 60-year trace predicts a 243-year cycle .",
    "since the observations span @xmath0385 years , there is greater confidence in the 183-year cycle than in the longer one because at least two cycles have elapsed since 1610 .",
    "similar long - term cycles ranging from 169 to 189 years have been proposed for several decades @xcite .",

    "however , an alternative method to derive this secular period is to calculate the power spectrum of the ( o - c ) variation of the dates corresponding to the ( i ) cycle minima , ( ii ) cycle maxima , and ( iii ) the combined minima and maxima .    the following procedure was used to calculate the ( o - c ) residuals for each of the data sets given above , based only on the dates of minima and maxima listed in table 2 .",

    "the sinusoidal fit to the ( o - c ) data in figure [ f7 ] corresponds to the dominant periodicity of 188 years identified in the power spectra .",
    "another cycle with a period of @xmath47 years was also found .",
    "the possible variability in the length of the sunspot cycle was examined through a study of archival sunspot data from 1610  2005 . in the preliminary stage of our study , we analyzed archival data of sunspot numbers from 1700 - 2005 and sunspot areas from 1874 - 2005 using power spectrum analysis and phase dispersion minimization .",
    "this analysis showed that the schwabe cycle has a duration of ( 10.80 @xmath1 0.50 ) years ( table 3 ) and that this cycle typically ranges from @xmath010  12 years even though the entire range is from @xmath07  17 years .",
    "the focus of our study was to investigate whether this range was associated with a secular pattern in the length of the schwabe cycle .",

    "moreover , we derived our results from both the cycle minima and the cycle maxima .",
    "the fact that we found similar results from the two data sets suggests that the methods used to determine these cycles ( ngdc data ) did not have any significant impact on our results .",
    "the median trace analysis of the length of the sunspot number cycle provided secular periodicities of 183  243 years .",
    "this range overlaps with the long - term cycles of @xmath090  260 years which were identified directly from the fft and pdm analyses of the sunspot number and area data ( figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the power spectrum analysis of the ( o - c ) residuals of the dates of minima and maxima provided much clearer evidence of dominant cycles with periods of @xmath45 years , @xmath48 years , and @xmath47 years .",
    "these results are significant because at least two long - term cycles have transpired over the @xmath0385-year duration of the data set .",
    "the derived long - term cycles were compared in figure [ f8 ] with documented epochs of significant declines in sunspot activity , like the oort , wolf , sprer , maunder , and dalton minima @xcite . in this figure ,",
    "the modern sunspot number data were combined with earlier data from 1610 - 1715 @xcite and with reconstructed ( ancient ) data spanning the past 11,000 years @xcite .",
    "these reconstructed sunspot numbers were based on dendrochronologically - dated radiocarbon concentrations which were derived from models connecting the radiocarbon concentration with sunspot number @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed sunspot numbers are consistent with the occurrences of the historical minima ( e.g. , maunder minimum ) .",
    "@xcite found that over the past 70 years , the level of solar activity has been exceptionally strong .",
    "our 188-year periodicity is similar to the 205-year de vries - seuss cycle which has been identified from studies of the carbon-14 record derived from tree rings ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ f8 ] compares the historical and modern sunspot numbers with the derived secular cycles of length ( a ) 183 years (  4.2 ) , ( b ) 243-years (  4.2 ) , and ( c ) 188 years (  4.4 ) .",
    "the first two periodicities were derived from the median trace analysis , while the third one was derived from the power spectrum analysis of the sunspot number cycle ( o - c ) residuals .",
    "the fits for the 183-year periodicity all had the same amplitude , but were moderately out of phase with each other , while the fits for the 243-year periodicity were perfectly in phase for all data sets , but with different amplitudes .",
    "this figure shows that the 183- and 188-year cycles provided a more consistent match to the sunspot number data than the 243-year cycle , especially during the wolf , sprer , maunder , and dalton minima .",
    "in particular , we note that the more accurately determined 188-year cycle is consistent with the behavior of sunspot numbers over time . moreover , the four historic minima since 1200 , all occurred during the rising phase of our derived 188-year sunspot cycle when the length of the sunspot cycle was increasing .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows that , on average , the length of the sunspot cycle was highest when the actual number of sunspots was lowest . according to our model , the length of the sunspot cycle was growing during the maunder minimum when there were almost no sunspots visible .",
    "the existence of long - term solar cycles with periods between 90 and 200 years is not new to the literature .",
    "however , the nature of these cycles is still not understood .",
    "while @xcite noted evidence of a cycle of @xmath090 years in sunspot cycle amplitude variations , our studies of the length of the sunspot cycle have shown that the dominant cycle in these amplitude variations is 188 years , with weaker periods of @xmath040 and 87 years .",
    "our results suggest that this 188-year cycle is related to the basic schwabe cycle .",
    "while we would like to confirm this result using a longer baseline ( beyond 385 years ) , it should be noted that schwabe s 10-year period was derived from only 17 years ( less than two cycles ) of observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well - known from gauss work on orbits that an orbit can be uniquely defined if at least three positions along that orbit are known , as long as those positions cover critical parts of the orbit .",
    "so , our 188-year result may yet stand the test of time .",
    "our model predicts that the length of the sunspot number cycle should increase gradually over the next @xmath075 years , accompanied by a gradual decrease in the number of sunspots .",
    "this information can now be used to improve the accuracy of the current solar cycle models ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) to better predict the starting time of a given cycle .",
