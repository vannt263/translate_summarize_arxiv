    "over the past decade the fast progress in nanofabrication allowed the observation of single electron tunneling as well as coulomb blockade , cotunneling and kondo signatures in quantum dot devices .",
    "initially these dots were gate - controlled isolated islands in two - dimensional electron gases like gaas  @xcite .",
    "recently a new trend has evolved towards studying molecules in gated junctions .",
    "starting from small molecules  @xcite and bucky balls  @xcite also carbon nanotubes  @xcite and inas nanowires were studied  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to gate - defined quantum dots these molecules and nanowires possess a rich spectrum of internal degrees of freedom , which significantly influence non - equilibrium transport through these systems . in particular , the overlaps of the orbitals of a molecule with the states in the leads vary significantly , which results in asymmetric and orbital - dependent tunneling amplitudes .",
    "parallel to the experimental progress there have been numerous theoretical studies on non - equilibrium transport through nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges consists in the new energy scale introduced by the bias voltage , which is in general of the same order as the internal energy scales of the system .",
    "the understanding of non - equilibrium phenomena in the presence of strong correlations represents an outstanding task in condensed matter physics which requires the development of powerful theoretical tools .",
    "recent advances include various renormalisation group ( rg ) methods  @xcite introduced for the study of quantum dots mainly dominated by spin fluctuations .    motivated by the experimental developments  @xcite we will study a quantum dot possessing multiple orbitals and asymmetric tunneling amplitudes .",
    "a previous perturbative study  @xcite showed that such systems generically exhibit interesting non - equilibrium features like the so - called cascade effect and the appearance of a negative differential conductance ( ndc ) .",
    "our main focus is the analysis of the logarithmic enhancements of these features due to the kondo effect and the interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom . even without spin - orbit interaction",
    "the renormalisation of spin and orbital scattering processes can influence each other in multi - orbital quantum dots .",
    "the minimal model to observe these features is provided by a two - orbital quantum dot with finite orbital splitting , an external magnetic field , and differing tunneling amplitudes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .    .",
    "the orbitals are coupled to free fermionic leads held at different chemical potentials @xmath0 .",
    "the system is assumed to be in the regime of single occupancy and the dot orbitals are subject to an external magnetic field @xmath1 . ]",
    "we consider the coulomb blockade region with a single electron on the dot .",
    "in this situation the orbital or spin degree of freedom can be changed by elastic or inelastic cotunneling processes . using a schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) transformation",
    "@xcite we derive a kondo spin exchange as well as an orbital potential scattering ( ps ) interaction , which have the same strength and therefore must be treated on an equal footing .",
    "the orbital ps term includes two processes , one involving a change of the orbital index and one describing transport via the empty orbital .",
    "we first study the orbital occupations and the differential conductance to second order in perturbation theory ( pt ) , which provides a reliable and comprehensive picture of the considered non - equilibrium physics .",
    "in the main part of the paper we perform an rg analysis with frequency - dependent couplings  @xcite and study the effect of the orbital ps .",
    "this method was recently used to study cotunneling transport through carbon nanotubes modelled by a two - orbital anderson dot with two electrons  @xcite . while for this situation",
    "orbital ps contributions are expected to play an important role , the impact of an empty orbital remains to be assessed . furthermore , transport through a double quantum dot coupled to four different leads was investigated in ref .  @xcite . in this work ndc with respect to one pair of the leads was observed and a detailed rg analysis of the transport properties as a function of the orbital splitting was performed .",
    "in our set - up ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) we study the dependence of the cascade resonance and the ndc on both the coupling asymmetry and the external magnetic field . by including the logarithmic corrections to the inelastic cotunneling processes",
    "we further show that the interplay between spin and orbital scattering is most pronounced for strong asymmetric couplings to the reservoirs .",
    "the detected enhancement of the ndc reveals the importance of kondo correlations for the appearance of this effect , whose signatures can be probed in transport experiments  @xcite .",
    "we start from a two - orbital anderson model sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 .",
    "in second quantisation the fermionic leads are described by @xmath3 with @xmath4 , the chemical potentials @xmath5 and the density of states @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the dot hamiltonian reads @xmath8 with the orbital index @xmath9 , the spin index @xmath10 , and an orbital - independent local coulomb interaction .",
    "the energies of the orbitals are @xmath11 and @xmath12 with an external magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that the orbital splitting @xmath13 is assumed to be finite .",
    "the orbitals are coupled to the leads by @xmath14 with spin - independent hopping amplitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in the following",
    "we will consider the regime with exactly one electron on the dot , i.e. @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "we use a generalised sw transformation to derive an effective kondo model @xmath19 in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "we find the conventional kondo spin exchange interaction in its two - orbital form @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . in an experimental set - up the overlaps between the states on the dot and in the leads",
    "will strongly depend on the lead and orbital indices , thus leading to a strong asymmetry as well as orbital dependence of the hopping amplitudes @xmath15 and the kondo couplings @xmath25 .",
    "in addition to the sw transformation generates a spin - independent _ orbital _ ps term @xmath26 where @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "the second term @xmath29 describes cotunneling transport across the empty orbital , e.g. orbital @xmath30 if orbital @xmath31 is occupied .",
    "the first term @xmath32 is a spin - conserving process which changes the orbital state of the dot ; we therefore expect a significant influence on the current at voltages @xmath33 .",
    "we emphasise that is of the same order as the kondo interaction and hence can not be neglected . in particular",
    ", we show below that the orbital ps term qualitatively changes the rg flow of the kondo couplings . in order to distinguish the kondo and orbital ps contributions we will denote the couplings of the latter by @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) in the following .",
    "furthermore , we study the system at the particle - hole symmetric point , i.e. @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the conventional single - orbital ps contribution ( @xmath39 ) can be neglected ( @xmath40 has already been assumed in the sw transformation ) .    to simplify the notations",
    "we introduce a generalised vertex @xmath41 via @xmath42 where @xmath43 initially both interaction terms and are rotational symmetric in spin space , i.e. @xmath44 are independent of the spin index @xmath45 on the dot .",
    "as we will see below , the rg flow leads to a breaking of this symmetry .",
    "furthermore , from now on we use the einstein summation convention and parametrise the couplings as @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",

    "we first study the system using second order pt .",

    "the underlying approximations are devised for @xmath67 providing a cutoff for the flow to strong coupling .",
    "we start with the representation . during the rg flow the vertex @xmath41 acquires a dependence on the energies of the incoming and outgoing lead electrons as well as the involved dot states . approximating the latter by their respective resonance energies @xmath59 and using energy conservation we deduce that @xmath41 will depend on the frequency @xmath68 of the incoming electron only .",
    "thus during the rg flow we can use the parametrisation with @xmath68-dependent couplings @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath34 and @xmath36",

    "the onset of @xmath131 becomes more pronounced with stronger asymmetry .",
    "we stress that the mechanism leading to ndc in the present model is fundamentally different from the ndc observed in the interacting resonant level model  @xcite where it has its origin in a voltage - dependent renormalisation of the hopping amplitudes towards smaller values .",

    "inhibits a clear distinction of the different transitions .",
    "the small absolute values of the conductance are due to the small values of the initial couplings @xmath148 required by our perturbative treatment .",
    "however , we expect the cascade effect as well as the appearance of ndc to be generic features of non - equilibrium transport through multi - orbital quantum dots .",
    "in particular , these features are expected to show up in the kind of transport experiments on molecules and nanowires as carried out in refs .",
