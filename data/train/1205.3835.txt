    "theoretical studies have suggested that the first stars , population iii ( pop iii ) , formed in @xmath6 dark matter ` minihaloes ' at redshifts @xmath7 @xcite . due to a lack of efficient coolants in metal - free gas , pop iii stars",
    "are thought to have been more massive than typical stars forming today .",
    "the details of their formation process , especially the shape of the pop iii initial mass function ( imf ) , are still a subject of intense study .",
    "early works suggested these stars were extremely massive , exceeding @xmath8 , and formed one per minihalo @xcite .",
    "more recent studies , exploring fragmentation at higher densities @xcite , or modeling the effects of protostellar feedback @xcite , have begun to suggest an imf extending to lower masses .",
    "detailed simulations that will further constrain the pop iii imf are needed to assess the role that these stars played in early cosmic milestones , such as chemical enrichment of the igm , reionzation , and the formation of supermassive black hole seeds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "directly observing a chemically pristine stellar population would represent a significant step towards understanding the formation and properties of pop iii stars .",
    "however , the chances of detecting individual , high - redshift pop iii stars with the upcoming _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) are very low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . while a single pair - instability supernova ( pisn ) from a massive pop iii star may be detectable ( e.g. , *",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clusters of pop iii stars , if they exist , would present the best opportunity for directly observing a metal - free stellar population @xcite .",
    "it would seem that the haloes capable of hosting these clusters , with virial masses @xmath9 and often dubbed to be the first galaxies @xcite , would have formed in high - density , biased regions , chemically pre - enriched with pop iii supernova ejecta @xcite , precluding the possibility of pop iii star formation .",
    "there are scenarios , however , in which these haloes reach the conditions necessary for atomic cooling while still metal - free .",
    "for example , if a strong hydrogen molecule dissociating ` lyman - werner ' ( lw ) radiation background was set up sufficiently early ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or if pop iii stars ended their lives by collapsing directly to form black holes @xcite , the onset of local metal enrichment would have been substantially delayed .",
    "additionally , pockets of metal - free gas could have remained until very low redshifts owing to inhomogeneous metal dispersal @xcite .",
    "recently , the detection of metal - free gas clouds at @xmath10 @xcite has confirmed that regions of space can remain chemically pristine long after reionization .",
    "it has been suggested that two different modes of metal - free star formation occurred in the early universe .",
    "first generation pop iii stars ( pop iii.1 ) formed from initial conditions completely unaffected by previous star formation .",
    "second generation pop iii stars ( pop iii.2 ) formed from gas significantly influenced by the radiative output of previous star formation , but still containing no stellar nucleosynthetic products @xcite . cooling by the hydrogen deuteride ( hd ) molecule is generally thought to differentiate pop iii.1 and pop iii.2 star formation . unlike @xmath0 , which can not cool gas below @xmath11 ,",
    "hd possesses an intrinsic electric dipole moment and can thus act as an effective cooling agent below @xmath12 , possibly resulting in stars with lower characteristic masses .",
    "the abundance of hd can be enhanced in regions with an elevated free electron fraction .",
    "these regions can be produced from virialization shocks in haloes with virial temperatures @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or in the collapse of relic hii regions produced around pop iii.1 stars @xcite .",
    "for reference , @xmath14 is related to the virial mass of a halo as ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean molecular weight ( @xmath17 for neutral atomic primordial gas ) , @xmath18 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath20 is the total mass contained within the radius in which the average matter density is @xmath21 times the critical density .",
    "theoretical investigations examining the chemistry , cooling , and dynamics of these regions have shown that gas is able to cool to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( @xmath22 ) as a result of hd cooling .",
    "this may result in lower characteristic fragmentation masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one effect that can suppress gaseous collapse , star formation , and metal enrichment in small cosmic haloes is a pervasive uv background .",
    "photons with energies in the range @xmath23 , the lw bands , are capable of photo - dissociating @xmath0 , the key cooling agent in metal - free gas below @xmath24 , and have a very small optical depth in a neutral igm . additionally , the photodestruction of @xmath25 , an intermediary in the gas - phase formation of @xmath0 , can also limit the @xmath0 abundance .",
    "many studies have explored the effect of an uv background on early structure formation @xcite .",
    "it is accepted that above a certain radiation intensity , @xmath26 , lw radiation delays the collapse and cooling of metal - free gas until the assembly of more massive haloes .. higher uv background intensities , @xmath27 , completely suppress baryonic collapse and cooling in haloes which allow only @xmath0 cooling . in this regime , significant cooling will not occur until the assembly of larger mass haloes with virial temperatures @xmath28 , the atomic cooling threshold . in these haloes , @xmath29 emission will allow the gas to radiate its internal energy and collapse , effectively independent of the radiation background longward of @xmath30 .",
    "studies that have explored the thermodynamical evolution of metal - free gas exposed to a strong uv background @xcite have similarly found that the evolution of metal - free gas undergoing free - fall or isobaric collapse is determined in large part by the background intensity , with the onset of effective @xmath0 cooling delayed with an increasing @xmath31 .",
    "gas that reaches the atomic cooling threshold is able to collapse isothermally while remaining at @xmath32 until @xmath0 forms in sufficient abundance for its cooling rate to exceed the adiabatic heating rate , though this picture depends on the role played by @xmath29 radiation trapping ( see * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , there exists a spectrum - dependent critical lw radiation intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath33 , above which @xmath0 never becomes an effective coolant . in this regime ,",
    "lw irradiated gas collapses to high density via @xmath29 and @xmath34 free - bound emission .",

    "the atomic cooling threshold is an appealing criterion for classifying objects as the first galaxies ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "these haloes , with virial masses @xmath35 at @xmath36 , distinguish themselves from minihaloes in that in them , metal - free gas can cool and collapse even in the presence of a strong uv radiation field .",
    "additionally , supersonic turbulent gas flows , typically not present in minihaloes , should potentially develop during the assembly of the more massive haloes @xcite .",
    "this turbulence may have influenced the process of star formation in pop iii.2 star forming haloes .    to understand star formation in the first galaxies ,",
    "it is instructive to take guidance from the better understood case of star formation in the nearby universe .",
    "overall , the formation of stars is observed to be extremely slow , in the sense that molecular clouds undergoing free - fall collapse should have star formation rates @xmath37 times higher than the observed rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "observational and theoretical work has suggested this inefficiency stems from a number of effects , including supersonic turbulence , protostellar outflows , magnetic fields , and radiative feedback from massive stars .",
    "state - of - the - art radiative transfer simulations of star formation including these effects are able to reproduce the imf and star formation rate in orion - type galactic star forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while there are undoubtedly many effects which influence star formation , it is becoming accepted that the interplay of supersonic turbulence , gas self - gravity , and protostellar feedback are the key players ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we are particularly interested in whether supersonic turbulence plays a role in regulating star formation in the first , metal - free galaxies .    in this work",
    ", we present the results of a high - resolution cosmological simulation that follows the assembly of a metal - free , atomically cooling @xmath2 dark matter halo in an environment exposed to strong lw radiation .",
    "we accurately compute the column density of @xmath0 to properly model the transition where @xmath0 starts shielding itself from lw radiation , as is necessary for the formation of a cool , dense , baryonic core where star formation can take place .",
    "we utilize a spatially adaptive grid to resolve densities up to @xmath38 and length scales down to @xmath39 . then , we employ sink particles to study the long - term fragmentation tendencies of the gas .",
    "similar studies that focused on lw suppression of @xmath0 explored smaller values of the radiation intensity , @xmath40 , than we consider here and argued that @xmath0 self - shielding was not an important effect in the small mass haloes they considered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other studies that explored much higher values of @xmath31 , relevant for the theoretical scenario where supermassive black hole seeds form by direct gaseous collapse , only included @xmath0 self - shielding in an approximate fashion based on purely local estimates of the @xmath0 column density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ". this work bridges the gap between these two extremes , exploring the scenario in which collapse in metal - free gas is delayed by lw radiation until the halo reaches the atomic cooling threshold , but with @xmath31 remaining below @xmath33 and thus permitting @xmath0 cooling to play a major thermodynamic role .",
    "we will address two primary questions in this study .",
    "first , what is the nature of the fragmentation which occurs in the cold , self - shielding gas ?",
    "utilizing sink particles , we can evolve the gas long past the initial gravitational collapse to times when a significant mass has been accreted by these particles .",
    "we can also identify any additional collapsing regions which would represent other potential star forming clumps . in addressing this question ,",
    "we will comment on the importance of hd cooling which is thought to give rise to enhanced fragmentation , thus producing a distinct population of metal - free stars with lower characteristic stellar masses .",
    "second , is it possible that lw radiation delayed collapse in metal - free atomic cooling haloes can produce clusters of pop iii stars that have luminosities high enough to be detectable and identifiable with the jwst ?",
    "@xcite showed that clusters of pop iii stars with total stellar masses as low as @xmath41 should be detectable at @xmath42 in deep jwst exposures and that their primordial composition can be ascertained based on simple colour criteria . in a similar study , @xcite suggested that a star formation rate of a few solar masses per year at @xmath36 will be needed for jwst detection .",
    "we provide rough estimates for the star formation efficiencies and mass spectra of high - redshift , metal - free stellar populations in atomic cooling haloes and comment on the feasibility of detection .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : numerical_setup ]",
    "we describe the initial conditions of the simulation and our numerical methodology . in section [ sec : results ] we present results of the simulation . in section [ sec : turbulence ]",

    "in section [ sec : discussion ] we provide further comments on our results , including a discussion on the expected intensity of the lw background , the effect of internal radiative feedback , and the detection prospects of metal - free stellar clusters with the jwst . and finally , we summarize our results and conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume cosmological parameters consistent with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) 7 year results @xcite : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "additionally , all quantities will be expressed in physical rather than comoving units unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "we use the publicly available adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code flash @xcite , version 3.3 , which solves the equations of eulerian hydrodynamics with the directionally split , piecewise parabolic method of @xcite .",
    "baryons are represented by a multispecies fluid and dark matter by collisionless , massive particles .",
    "the gravitational potential of gas and dark matter is computed with the iterative multigrid poisson solver of @xcite .",
    "we initialize the simulation at @xmath49 in a @xmath50 @xmath51 ( comoving ) box .",
    "cosmological initial conditions were generated with mpgrafic @xcite , a parallel version of the multiscale gaussian random field generator grafic @xcite .",
    "we first run a @xmath52 dark matter only simulation and use the halo finder hop of @xcite to locate the site of the first @xmath53 dark matter halo in the simulation volume .",
    "we then carry out a hierarchical zoom - in procedure to increase the mass resolution around this halo using three separate levels of dark matter refinement to reach a maximum effective resolution of @xmath54 and an effective dark matter particle mass of @xmath55 in the target halo itself .",
    "we choose the volume of the highest resolution region such that the total mass contained within it is @xmath56 , 10 times the mass of our target halo .",
    "we have verified that only the highest resolution dark matter particles are found in our target halo .",
    "given our box size , the expected number of @xmath53 dark matter haloes at @xmath57 is of order 10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to capture gaseous collapse to progressively higher densities , we utilize amr which creates more finely spaced grids ( refines ) in localized regions .",
    "to trigger refinement , we use two separate criteria that are based on local gas properties .",
    "we employ a criterion very similar to that used in @xcite which refines based on baryonic overdensity . in this scheme ,",
    "the threshold comoving density for refinement is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the comoving baryonic density , @xmath60 is the current level of refinement , @xmath61 is the initial level of refinement ( given our grid resolution , @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 is the lagrangian refinement factor ; @xmath64 enforces constant baryonic mass - per - cell while @xmath65 implies that the mass - per - cell decreases with increasing refinement level .",
    "we set @xmath66 which results in a baryonic mass - per - cell at the highest refinement level ( @xmath67 ) of @xmath68 .",
    "a hydrodynamical simulation of a self - gravitating fluid must properly resolve the jeans length to be physically reliable .",
    "for grid - based eulerian codes , this requirement is expressed by the truelove criterion @xcite , which states that the jeans length , @xmath69 must be resolved by at least 4 grid cell widths to avoid artificial fragmentation .",
    "while this criterion was originally formulated for isothermal gas and does not take into account the effect of hubble expansion , it is commonly utilized in hydrodynamical - cosmological simulations .",
    "it would be unnecessary to enforce this criterion across the whole grid , thus we only apply it in the innermost region of the simulation where the most highly refined dark matter particles are present . in this work",
    ", we always resolve the jeans length by at least 12 grid cells and derefine the grid if it is resolved by more than 24 .",
    "while this is more than sufficient to properly resolve the fragmentation tendencies of gas , it may be insufficient to study the possible small - scale turbulent flow in the gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the flash code allows for no explicit force softening beyond local ( e.g. , one cell wide ) cloud - in - cell smearing of the dark matter particle mass density on the computational grid . in our simulation , because of amr , the grid spacing can become many orders of magnitude smaller than interparticle separation .",
    "when this happens , the dark matter particle discreteness can introduce severe artifacts into the calculation of the gravitational potential and cause gas on the computational grid to feel the gravity of individual dark matter particles . to achieve sufficient smoothness in the dark matter particle mass distribution ,",
    "we have developed an algorithm that spatially smears the dark matter density before it is passed to the poisson solver .    for each dark matter",
    "particle we compute a smoothing kernel radius @xmath70 over which the mass of the particle is to be distributed , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the dark matter particle mass and @xmath73 is the baryonic density of the cell containing the dark matter particle .",
    "this choice of smoothing radius ensures that the average dark matter mass per cell contributed by a single dark matter particle inside its smoothing kernel , if multiplied by @xmath74 , is not larger than the baryonic mass inside the particle s host cell . within the smearing radius ,",
    "we distribute the particle mass following the quadratic ( or ` epanechnikov ' ) kernel @xmath75 .    in practice",
    ", we achieve the smearing by replacing the dark matter particle with a sufficient number of daughter particles with total mass equal to that of the parent particle and with density approximating the kernel profile .",

    "the daughter particle spacing is approximately equal to the cell spacing of the parent particle s computational cell .",
    "computation of the gravitational potential is performed from the daughter particle density .",
    "computation of the parent particle s acceleration is then carried out in a momentum conserving fashion by summing up the gravitational force over daughter particles and assigning the result to the parent particle .",

    "* ) , though at much higher densities and smaller spatial scales than probed here .    in general , two conditions must be met for a disc to fragment .",
    "the disc must be gravitationally unstable which requires that the toomre @xmath320 parameter , @xmath321 , be less than unity @xcite , where @xmath322 is the sound speed in the disc , @xmath323 is the angular velocity , and @xmath324 is the gas surface density .",
    "additionally , even if a disc is gravitationally unstable , a number of effects can prevent fragmentation into gravitationally bound collapsing clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite argued that a key effect influencing the fragmentation behavior of a disc is the balance between cooling and the dissipation of turbulence , which is a source of heating .",
    "quantitatively , gammie found that if @xmath325 then discs tend to fragment into clumps .    in the top panel of figure [ fig : gammie_toomre ]",

    "elevated electron abundances created by the ionizing radiation emitted by the first stars , or in our case , by collisional ionization in @xmath28 haloes , are thought to result in an increase of the hd abundance ( see section [ chemistry ] ) .",

    "@xcite found that hd cooling was responsible for gas cooling to the cmb temperature after the collapse of a pop iii.1 relic hii region and argued this was responsible for reducing the mass of the clump which eventually will undergo runaway collapse .",
    "there has even been a suggestion , by @xcite , that in pop iii.1 star formation hd cooling may play a thermodynamically significant role .",
    "in contrast , other studies that have examined the collapse of metal - free gas in a similar context to the one explored here are in agreement that hd never plays a major thermodynamic role @xcite .",
    "we propose two related reasons for the lack of significant hd cooling in our simulation .",
    "first , as found by @xcite using one - zone models , the lw flux necessary to suppress hd cooling is @xmath344 .",
    "this is far smaller than the flux required to completely suppress @xmath0 formation and cooling , @xmath345 @xcite .",
    "this critical hd flux is not the result of direct hd photodissociation , but is instead due to the partial photodissociation of @xmath0 which never permits a significant fraction of gas to cool below @xmath346 where significant hd fractionation can occur .",
    "second , at @xmath181 where @xmath0 cooling becomes effective , the free electron abundance is not high enough to drive up the @xmath0 abundance .",
    "gas heated to high temperatures in virialization shocks can have a free electron abundance of @xmath243 , but only at low densities , @xmath347 . at larger densities around @xmath180",
    "the electron abundance drops to @xmath348 ( see figure [ fig : abundance_multiplot ] ) , below the residual abundance after recombination , simply because the electron recombination time is inversely proportional to density .",
    "this would seem to suggest that pop iii.2 star formation is very similar to pop iii.1 , at least in the scenario explored here .",
    "a key physical parameter in this study is the intensity of the constant lw radiation background .",
    "given the large mean free path of photons with energies below @xmath30 , the formation of the first stars should have established a lw background well before the completion of reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in terms of the cosmic star formation rate",
    ", we can estimate @xmath31 as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the number of lw photons produced per stellar baryon , @xmath351 is the star formation rate per comoving volume , and the lifetime of stars producing the lw radiation is implicitly assumed to be @xmath352 .",
    "the star formation rate is normalized with a reasonable value around @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another estimate of @xmath31 can be obtained by considering the ionizing background needed to reionize the universe .",
    "assuming that reionization was driven by photons with energies just above the lyman limit , it is straightforward to estimate the value of the uv background just below the limit , @xmath353 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath354 where @xmath355 is the number of ionizing photons - per - baryon required to reionize the universe and @xmath356 is the ionizing photon escape fraction from high - redshift star forming galaxies .",
    "both of the above estimates suggest that before reionization was complete , radiation intensities as high as @xmath357 , the value we adopt here , were realized in the universe . depending on the scenario for reionization , these may overestimate the mean background intensity , but @xcite showed that , due to dark matter halo clustering , a small fraction of haloes can experience lw intensities greatly above the global mean value .    even though the uv background intensity around the time of reionization is very uncertain , the above estimates suggest it was likely far above the threshold , @xmath358 , that would have suppressed the formation of @xmath0 in small - mass @xmath359 haloes , thus delaying cooling and star formation until the assembly of atomic cooling haloes . as we shall discuss in section [ sec : direct_observations ] , the precise value of @xmath31 may significantly change the results of our simulation , particularly the star formation efficiency .    for more accurate estimates of @xmath31 we can look to other studies which have undertaken detailed modeling of the redshift evolution of the lw background intensity . in figure",
    "[ fig : jlw_compilation ] , we show three such estimates in the literature .",
    "we also show the lw intensity which would have accompanied reionization at @xmath360 ( top solid line ) assuming the fiducial values in equation ( [ eq : j21_reionization ] ) . additionally , we plot the redshift - dependent lw radiation intensity @xmath361 needed to completely suppress @xmath0 formation in haloes with @xmath362 ( bottom solid line ) .",
    "we compute @xmath361 by equating the @xmath31-dependent minimum halo mass needed for @xmath0 cooling with the halo mass at which the virial temperature equals @xmath24 ( equations 12 and 14 from * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite do not rely on a semi - analytic approach , but instead carry out transfer of ionizing and lw radiation in a large , cosmological , @xmath368-body simulation .",
    "their resolution , however , is limited to @xmath53 , which may be responsible for their @xmath31 estimate being the lowest at high redshifts , as can be seen in figure [ fig : jlw_compilation ] .",
    "there are numerous uncertainties in these estimates of @xmath364 , particularly in the choice of star formation efficiency ( which is likely to depend on @xmath31 itself , as well as the redshift , halo mass , and metallicity ) , lw escape fraction of radiation , mass and multiplicity of pop iii sources , and different prescriptions for star formation feedback .",
    "we note that all these models assume that pop iii sources have an extremely top - heavy imf with a characteristic mass @xmath132 . in spite of these uncertainties ,",
    "most of these estimates seem to converge around @xmath57 , but they still underpredict the lw intensity that would have accompanied reionization by @xmath360 . additionally , all models suggest that at @xmath369 , the average lw radiation field is large enough to completely suppress cooling and star formation in haloes with @xmath362",
    ".    furthermore , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lw radiation field is expected to be very spatially uniform around the time of reionization , in the sense that isolated regions with @xmath31 significantly above or below the mean were extremely rare .",
    "this homogeneity increases with decreasing redshift and increasing spatial scale . compared to this spatially homogenous lw radiation feedback",
    ", chemical enrichment of the igm by galactic outflows has been suggested to be extremely inhomogeneous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the scenario we explore in this work , a chemically pristine atomic cooling halo subjected to a strong lw background , is a physically plausible scenario for the formation of metal - free stellar clusters .",
    "this work focused on the impact of an external lw radiation background and its effect on star formation in metal - free atomic cooling haloes .",
    "however , once a starburst begins , lw and photoionizing radiation feedback from internal sources will likely impact subsequent star formation .",
    "@xcite explored the conditions under which a metal - free gaseous clump exposed to lw radiation can continue to collapse and form stars .",
    "they argue that star formation in gas clumps will be suppressed if the @xmath0 photodissociation time , @xmath370 , is shorter than the free - fall time of the clump .",
    "@xcite derived that @xmath370 for a spherical , homogeneous cloud of density @xmath98 , mass @xmath303 , and distance @xmath371 from a source which produces @xmath372 lw photons per second is given by @xmath373 where @xmath374 is the fraction of incident photons which are actually absorbed by the cloud , @xmath375 is the fraction of @xmath0 excitations by a lw photon which result in a successful dissociation , and @xmath376 and @xmath377 are measured in units of @xmath378 and parsecs , respectively .",
    "considering the simulation here , a clump at a distance of @xmath215 from the source of lw photons ( which we take to be the sink particle ) has a characteristic mass on order of the jeans mass @xmath379 , density @xmath380 , and an @xmath0 abundance @xmath175 . if we reasonably assume that the central sink particle forms roughly ten @xmath381 stars ( see section [ sec : fragmentation ] ) the lw photon production rate is @xmath382 .",

    "evidently the effect of lw radiative feedback on subsequent star formation is a strong function of @xmath372 and the source distance .",
    "if star formation which occurs in the sink particle results in a lw photon production rate of @xmath382 , it is clear from figure [ fig : radial_density_lw ] that further collapse and star formation will be strongly suppressed in the uncollapsed fraction of the self - shielding core , even given the large simplifications we have made in this analysis .",
    "this may have an adverse effect on the overall star formation efficiency and detectability of these systems .",
    "since the basic characteristics and formation mechanisms of the first cosmic structures are very uncertain , one of the main goals of future observations with the jwst is to observe light from the first stars and galaxies . by modeling metal - free synthetic stellar spectra , @xcite determined jwst exposure limits and colour criteria for high - redshift , metal - free galaxies .",
    "given the uncertainties of these sources , @xcite explored a large parameter space defined by the shape of the stellar imf , nebular emission strength , stellar population age , stellar mass , and formation redshift .",
    "their most optimistic scenario involves a @xmath390 myr old stellar population with an extremely top - heavy imf ( @xmath391 for @xmath392 ) and maximal nebular emission , requiring a vanishing escape fraction of ionizing radiation , @xmath393 . at @xmath57 , a cluster with stellar mass @xmath394 and",
    "the above characteristics would just be detectable ( at @xmath395 ) with jwst in ultra - deep ( @xmath396 hr ) broadband exposures .",
    "given our finding that @xmath397 of cold gas becomes available for star formation in an atomic cooling halo at @xmath398 exposed to a lw intensity of @xmath4 , it seems extremely unlikely this starburst could be detected by jwst , even if @xmath399 of the mass turns into stars with an extremely top - heavy imf .",

    "an inspection of figure [ fig : jlw_compilation ] suggests that a background lw intensity @xmath400 , at least for @xmath401 , would have fully suppressed star formation in halos not capable of atomic cooling .    to get a sense of how the mass of cold gas depends on @xmath197",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "first , recall equation ( [ eq : ncool2 ] ) which expresses the density at which @xmath0 cooling becomes effective , @xmath180 , as a function of @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",

    "the abundance of free electrons would be higher at lower densities , but by how much is difficult to determine given the highly non - equilibrium electron abundance .",
    "for example , if @xmath198 is @xmath307 times higher than in our simulation at @xmath180 and if @xmath406 , the mass of cold gas would be @xmath407 . if we furthermore assume a relatively high star formation efficiency , @xmath408 , which represents the fraction of cold gas that will eventually turn into stars , we find a total stellar mass of @xmath409 .",
    "even if these stars form with an extremely top - heavy imf , a possibility recent simulations suggest is unlikely ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the analysis of @xcite implies this cluster will not be detectable with the jwst .",
    "one effect , however , which may render these targets within the jwst detection limit is gravitational lensing .",
    "low - redshift galaxy clusters are capable of magnifying high - redshift sources by factors of @xmath410 .",
    "indeed , the recently discovered @xmath411 galaxy macs 1149-jd1 @xcite is gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy cluster with a magnification factor of @xmath412 , though lensing was not strictly required for its detection . to this end",
    ", @xcite estimated the conditions under which the jwst could detect gravitationally lensed , metal - free stellar populations behind the @xmath413 galaxy cluster macs j0717.5 + 3745 , an ideal gravitational lens for high - redshift stellar sources .",
    "mock halo catalogs of metal - free galaxies , generated with the methodology of @xcite , were simulated to lie beyond this particular galaxy cluster and the expected number of metal - free stellar populations as a function of limiting magnitude was generated .",
    "the primary source of uncertainty in these estimates is @xmath414 , the efficiency of pop iii.2 star formation , defined as @xmath415 .",
    "this efficiency could be broken down as @xmath416 , where @xmath417 is the fraction of a halo s baryonic mass which is cold and available for star formation and @xmath418 is , as before , the fraction of cold gas that will eventually become incorporated into stars .",
    "@xcite find that with efficiencies as low as @xmath419 , clusters of metal - free stars with moderately top - heavy imfs , @xmath420 , will be visible in deep jwst lensing surveys around macs j0717.5 + 3745 .",
    "our optimistic @xmath406 scenario , described above , results in an efficiency @xmath421 .",
    "thus , according to the estimates of @xcite and our relatively crude estimate for the pop iii.2 star formation efficiency , it appears that jwst will marginally detect metal - free stellar populations in deep , foreground cluster lensing enhanced surveys .",
    "this conclusion , though , is very approximate and more detailed studies are needed to fully assess the observational prospects for detecting these primitive , low luminosity stellar clusters .",

    "mach numbers increase to @xmath428 within @xmath248 years . * within the inner @xmath182 of the halo , the gas flow becomes supersonic only when @xmath0 cooling becomes effective .",
    "the gas density pdf in the cold , self - shielding gas is approximately log - normal and has a width consistent with the turbulent mach number of the flow given expectations derived from idealized simulations in which turbulence is driven by a mixture of solenoidal and compressive forcing . with time , the density pdf acquires a high density power - law tail as self - gravitating gas decouples from the turbulent flow . *",
    "the rate of gaseous collapse on scales comparable to the size of the self - shielding region is suppressed compared to what would be expected if all the gas in the self - shielding core was collapsing at its free - fall rate . by the time the sink particle grows to @xmath301 of the total mass of the self - shielding cloud , no other sinks have formed , suggesting any additional sites of fragmentation remain unresolved in the simulation .",
    "we find an upper - limit to the star formation rate per free - fall time of @xmath429 on scales of @xmath182 .",
    "we argue this is due to the additional effective pressure provided by infall - driven supersonic turbulence on large scales and centrifugal support on smaller ones . *",
    "hd cooling was found to be thermodynamically insignificant for the entirety of the gas evolution .",
