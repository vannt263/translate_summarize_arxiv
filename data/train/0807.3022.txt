    "in particular , they consider the case when @xmath1 is a unimodal function , which is the situation for the famous nicholson s blowflies equation and the mackey - glass model .    in that reference ,",
    "the authors have proved several results on the global dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , and they also formulated some open problems .",
    "it is our purpose to prove new results in the direction initiated in @xcite , and also to answer some of the open questions .",
    "we show the applicability of our results for different cases of the nicholson s blowflies equation @xmath8 where @xmath2 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are positive parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a biological interpretation ) ; and the mackey - glass equation @xcite @xmath11    following @xcite , we assume that @xmath1 is unimodal . more precisely , the following hypothesis will be required :    1 .",
    "@xmath12 for all @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and there is a unique @xmath15 such that @xmath16 if @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 if @xmath20 .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) , when @xmath1 is a monotone function",
    ". however , unimodal feedback may lead to very complicated and still not completely understood dynamics .",
    "see @xcite and references thereof .",
    "we shall use the function @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the equilibria of ( [ 1 ] ) are the fixed points of @xmath24 , and that , under condition ( u ) , function @xmath24 has at most two fixed points @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    as in @xcite , we consider nonnegative solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we recall that for each nonnegative and nonzero function @xmath27,{{\\mathbb r}})$ ] , there exists a unique solution @xmath28 of ( [ 1 ] ) such that @xmath29 on @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 12 ) . )",
    "it is well known ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) that all solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) converge to @xmath32 if @xmath33 , whereas the positive equilibrium @xmath34 is globally attracting for eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) if @xmath35 ( equivalently , if @xmath36 ) .",
    "thus , we shall assume that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "ivanov and sharkovsky ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.3 ) proved that an invariant and attracting interval @xmath39 $ ] for @xmath24 is also invariant and attracting for ( [ 1 ] ) for all values of the delay @xmath40 , that is , @xmath41 for any nonzero solution @xmath42 of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "similar results were proven using a slightly different approach in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that we can choose @xmath43 , @xmath44 to get an attracting invariant interval @xmath39 $ ] for the map @xmath24 ( here , and in the following , @xmath45 denotes the composition @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , this interval contains the global attractor associated to eq ( [ 1 ] ) for all values of @xmath40 . using this fact , rst and wu obtain sufficient conditions to ensure that every solution of ( [ 1 ] ) enters the domain where @xmath3 is negative . in this case the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is governed by monotone delayed feedback and the comprehensive theory of monotone dynamics is applicable , as it was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "in particular , since a poincar - bendixson type theorem is available for ( [ 1 ] ) when @xmath3 is negative , this kind of conditions exclude the possibility of solutions with complicated asymptotic behaviour ( the @xmath47-limit set can only be the positive equilibrium @xmath34 or a periodic orbit ) .",
    "we include here the main results of @xcite in this direction    [ trw ] every solution of ( [ 1 ] ) enters the domain where @xmath3 is negative if any of the following conditions holds :    1 .",

    "notice that the first condition in theorem [ trw ] is independent of the delay , while condition ( l@xmath52 ) shows that even if @xmath1 is unimodal , the solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) have the same asymptotic behaviour as in the case of monotone decreasing feedback for all sufficiently small delay @xmath40 .",
    "an open problem suggested in @xcite is the following : under condition ( l ) , find the sharpest invariant and attracting interval containing the global attractor of ( [ 1 ] ) for all @xmath40 .",

    "we completely solve this problem in the case of nicholson s blowflies and mackey - glass equations , obtaining an interesting dichotomy result for ( [ nic ] ) and ( [ mg0 ] ) when condition ( l ) holds ( theorem [ tdic ] ) .",
    "we give a weaker delay - dependent condition different from ( l@xmath52 ) under which the statement of theorem [ trw ] remains valid .",
    "in other words , we can determine a @xmath60 that is larger than @xmath61 in theorem 1 , such that all solutions enter the domain where @xmath3 is negative , if @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , we provide some examples showing that the new condition significantly improves ( l@xmath52 ) in certain situations .",
    "in this section , we assume that condition ( u ) holds , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath63 . denote @xmath64    since @xmath37 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are well defined real numbers . assuming that ( l ) is satisfied , it is clear that @xmath67 and hence @xmath24 is decreasing on @xmath68 $ ] .",

    "an application of the above mentioned theorem 2.3 in @xcite gives the following result :    [ c3 ] under condition ( l ) , the interval @xmath72 $ ] is an attracting and invariant interval for ( [ 1 ] ) for all values of the delay @xmath40 .    [ r1 ]",
    "if the equilibrium @xmath34 is globally attracting for @xmath24 , then @xmath79 , and hence @xmath34 is also a global attractor for ( [ 1 ] ) for all values of the delay .",
