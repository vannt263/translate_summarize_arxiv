    "of the @xmath2150 globular clusters associated with the milky way galaxy , 12 have been seen to harbor a bright ( @xmath4 ergss@xmath5 ) , or transient , low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) @xcite .",
    "these binaries are presumably formed through stellar encounters in the dense cores of the clusters ; such events play an important role in the dynamical evolution of the clusters , as the formation of a single lmxb can impart enough kinetic energy to the surrounding stars to terminate a core collapse . at the same time , the globular cluster lmxbs provide a unique opportunity to study lmxbs at a well - known distance with a well - known ( and usually very poor ) metalicity level .",
    "the x - ray source x1832@xmath0330  in the globular cluster ngc  6652  is a lesser known example of this class .",
    "although the error box for the _ heao-1 _  source , h1825@xmath0331 , contained this cluster , it was originally not considered to be a secure identification because the error box covered a 2.7 deg@xmath6 area in sagittarius @xcite .",
    "the first secure detection of x1832@xmath0330  as a globular cluster lmxb was made during the course of the _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was detected in pointed _ rosat _",
    "observations @xcite , and two type i x - ray bursts from this source , as well as the persistent emission , have been detected using the wide field camera of the _ bepposax _  satellite @xcite .",
    "thus there is now a strong circumstantial evidence that the _ heao-1 _  source h1825@xmath0331 and x1832@xmath0330are the same source ; here we have adopted this identification as a working assumption .    in the abovementioned papers , the distance to x1832@xmath0330",
    "was assumed to be @xmath214.3 kpc .",
    "however , the first published color - magnitude diagram of this cluster @xcite has led to the re - evaluation of the distance to @xmath29.3 kpc , based on the measured v magnitudes v@xmath7=15.85@xmath10.04 of its horizontal branch ( as well as the interstellar reddening , e@xmath8=0.10@xmath10.02 ) .",
    "moreover , ngc  6652  appears to be significantly younger than the average globular clusters @xcite .",
    "thus the lmxb x1832@xmath0330  in ngc  6652  may provide an important comparison with other globular cluster sources , due to the relative youth and the relatively high metal content ( [ fe / h]=@xmath00.96 ) of this cluster ( though not the highest among globular clusters with lmxbs ) .    a search for the optical counterpart",
    "has recently been carried out using new ground - based data along with archival hst data @xcite .",
    "although the archival hst observations do not completely cover the x - ray error circle , the most promising candidate for the optical counterpart is their star 49 , which is relatively faint ( @xmath9=+5.5 ) compared with those of other globular cluster lmxbs .    in this paper",
    ", we present our analysis of a serendipitous _ asca _  observation of x1832@xmath0330 ; in comparing the previous observations with the _ asca _  data , we have recalculated the previously - published source luminosities for a new fiducial distance of 9.3 kpc .",
    "the region of the sky containing ngc  6652  was observed with the japanese x - ray satellite , _ asca _  @xcite between 1996 apr 6 20:12ut and apr 7 19:00 ut ( seq no 54016000 ) .",
    "this observation was part of a program to observe diffuse galactic emission , and only serendipitously included x1832@xmath0330  in its field of view .",
    "there are four co - aligned x - ray telescopes on - board _ asca _ , two with sis ( solid - state imaging spectrometers , using ccds ) detectors and two with gis ( gas imaging spectrometers ) detectors .",
    "however , little useful data were taken with gis-2 , due to a problem with its on - board processor40 min of useful gis-2 data , which we have chosen not to analyze . ] .",
    "no such problems exist for the sis data ; however , the observation was done with both sis detectors in 4-ccd mode , with x1832@xmath0330  near the center of the field of view .",
    "this pointing direction minimizes the vignetting , but the photons from x1832@xmath0330  are spread over all 4 chips , complicating the analysis .",
    "moreover , 4-ccd observations suffer most severely from the cumulative effect of radiation damage . as a consequence ,",
    "events below @xmath20.7 kev had to be discarded on - board to avoid telemetry saturation due to flickering pixels , and the spectral resolution and the quantum efficiency are both severely degraded @xcite .",
    "the degradation is believed to be due largely to residual dark distribution ( rdd ) : a significant fractions of the ccd pixels now show elevated levels of dark current , the histogram of which is strongly skewed . when rdd - affected data are processed ( on - board or on the ground ) assuming a gaussian distribution of dark current , this leads to incorrect pulse heights or spurious rejection of x - ray events as particle events .",
    "the current version of the response generator has a model of the degrading spectral resolution , but not one of the degrading quantum efficiency .",
    "we have used the ftool , correctrdd , which partially recovers the detection efficiency ; however , this algorithm is not 100% effective .",
    "moreover , the calibration of rdd - corrected data is uncertain .",
    "therefore , we have primarily relied on the gis data , cross - calibrated the rdd - corrected sis data against the gis data , and used the sis data only when gis data were unavailable .    since a bright source",
    "is clearly detected ( see below ) , we have opted to use loose sets of screening criteria . for the gis ,",
    "we use non - saa , non - earth - occult ( elv@xmath10 ) data at the standard high - voltage setting , and only exclude regions where the cut - off rigidity is less than 4 gev / c ; note that , for safety reasons , the high voltage is reduced well before the satellite enters the saa .",
    "after screening , we are left with @xmath242 ksec of good gis-3 data .    for the sis , we use additional criteria that the line of sight must be @xmath1120@xmath12 away from the sunlit earth , the time after day / night and saa transitions must be @xmath11128 s , and the pixl monitor counts for the ccd chips must be within the 3@xmath13 of their mean value .",
    "moreover , we have imposed the condition that the data must have been taken in the faint mode . to correct for rdd and dfe ( dark frame error , the variation in the mean dark level of all the pixels due primarily to scattered light on the ccd ) , we have applied faintdfe to the original faint mode data first , followed by correctrdd , before converting to bright2 mode , to minimize the interference between dfe and rdd corrections ) .",
    "this resulted in @xmath221 ksec of good sis data .",
    "we have tested the calibration of rdd - corrected sis data , by performing simultaneous fits to the gis-3 and sis data .",
    "we find that , even after the rdd correction , the best - fit sis model contains a spurious excess n@xmath14 of 1.6@xmath15 @xmath16 as well as a normalization below that of the gis-3 data by a factor of 1.17 .",
    "in fig.1 , we have plotted the background subtracted light curve of x1832@xmath0330  in 128 s bins .",
    "the source appears variable on short timescales ( from about a few bins of this diagram down to 4 sec ) : a straight line fit to a 4-s bin light curve , after removing the longer - term trend ( by subtracting a 256-s running average of itself ) yields a @xmath17 of 1.114 for 10479 degrees of freedom , meaning that the source is variable at a formal confidence level of @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , some caution is required at this level : although background is negligible , there may be systematic contribution to this apparent variability from , e.g. , attitude jitter or the imperfect correction of the time - dependent detector gain .",
    "moreover , a fourier transform did not reveal a periodicity in the range 8 s to @xmath21 hr ( with an rms amplitude of @xmath20.5% in this range ) ; the highest peaks in the periodogram in this range have semi - amplitudes of 1.6 % , while a signal would have to have an amplitude of @xmath112 % to be detected at @xmath1199% confidence .",
    "although there are some possible peaks in the periodogram at longer periods , we consider these to be rather unreliable , since they can be explained as due to an interplay of the quasi - regular data gaps and the increased count rate between 0 and 2 ut on apr 7 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; this flare - like event may well be part of the aperiodic variability .",
    "we do not see spectral changes during this flare - like event ( such as might be expected were it the tail of a type i burst ) .",
    "the highest peaks in the periodogram are at p=46600s ( @xmath11half the duration of the observation ) with a 4.5% amplitude , and at 17400 s ( 2.8% ) .",
    "although non - sinusoidal modulation ( e.g. , dipping activities ) with certain periods ( e.g. , near the 96 min spacecraft orbit ) may have eluded detection , this would seem to require an unfortunate coincidence .    in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we present the average gis-3 spectrum of x1832@xmath0330  with the best - fit power - law model .",
    "the fit is poor , with @xmath17 = 1.81 ; the parameters are photon index @xmath19 = 1.75@xmath10.01 and n@xmath14=3.6@xmath20 cm@xmath5 , and a 28 kev flux of 1.54@xmath22 ergs@xmath16s@xmath5 .",
    "note that the fitted n@xmath14 is considerably greater than that estimated from the optical extinction ( @xmath23 @xmath16 ) or the value derived from the _ rosat _  pspc spectral fit ( @xmath24 @xmath16 ; see also the bottom panel of fig .",
    "moreover , the inferred photon index @xmath19 is radically different between the _ asca _  gis ( 1.75 ) and _ rosat _  pspc ( 1.07 ) observations .",
    "we therefore must conclude that the spectrum of x1832@xmath0330is highly variable , more complex than a simple power law , or both .    as a likely candidate for the complex spectral shape ,",
    "we have tried a power law modified by a partial covering absorber ( with a fixed interstellar absorption of @xmath23 @xmath16 ) to the gis-3 data .",
    "this has markedly improved the fit ( to @xmath17=1.15 ; @xmath19=1.86@xmath25 , with @xmath267% covering by a n@xmath14=7.6@xmath26 @xmath16 absorber ) . moreover",
    ", this model provides a plausible description of the spectrum in a simultaneous fit to the _ asca _  gis and _ rosat _  pspc spectra ( fig .",
    "we therefore conclude that the x - ray spectrum of x1832@xmath0330  is not a simple power law .",
    "however , given the energy range of the data , and the current level of calibration uncertainties , we can not say for sure if this description of the spectral shape is unique , or preferred .",

    "+ @xmath29source identification remains tentative .",
    "+    in table 1 , we have summarized the long - term history of the x - ray luminosity of x1832@xmath0330 .      for the time intervals",
    "when both gis-3 and the sis instruments were taking data , the latter adds little .",
    "however , we have discovered a type i x - ray burst from x1832@xmath0330  in the section of sis data for which there is no gis-3 coverage .",
    "the light curves in three energy bands are shown in fig .",
    "the reason why this burst was not covered by the gis-3 data is that this happened just before _ asca _  went into the saa ; the high voltage level of the gis had already been reduced as a precaution .",
    "this segment of data ends when the sis also stopped taking data , as _ asca _  approached the saa .",
    "we have therefore examined the housekeeping as well as scientific data carefully to ascertain that this event is not an instrumental artefact .",
    "however , the radiation belt monitor counts indicate that the particle background was @xmath3010 cts@xmath5 , i.e. , at quiescent ( non - saa ) level ( all data with monitor rates up to 500 cts@xmath5 have routinely been included in gis data analysis , with no obvious ill effects ) .",
    "the monitor rate exceeded 1000 cts@xmath5 @xmath2200 s after the end of the sis data ( in contrast , the radiation belt monitor rates exceed 10,000 in the heart of the saa ) .",
    "moreover , the image of the burst is identical , to within statistics , to the quiescent image ( i.e. , has a distribution consistent with the xrt point spread function ) .",
    "thus , we believe that the burst originates from the same point - like source as the quiescent emission , i.e. , most likely x1832@xmath0330  in ngc  6652 .    the longer duration at lower energies , shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , is what is expected in a type i x - ray burst , as the neutron star cools .",
    "to further investigate the spectral evolution , we have performed spectral fitting of the 4 time intervals indicated in fig .",
    "we have used the combined sis-0/sis-1 data , and the quiescent sis spectrum as the background .",
    "we present the results of blackbody fits in fig .",
    "for interval 1 , we find that a significant n@xmath14 is required to fit the data adequately ; for the other intervals , the fitted n@xmath14 values are consistent with the interstellar n@xmath14 ( @xmath25@xmath31 @xmath16 ) , once the systematic offset of 1.6@xmath15 @xmath16 ( see  2 ) has been taken into account .",
    "as is typical of type i bursts , the color temperature shows a significant decline during the decay of the burst . the inferred radius of the blackbody emitter ( we have used the distance of 9.3 kpc and included the normalization correction factor of 1.17 ) also shows behavior typical of type i bursts , although it may be on the small side .",
    "the inferred bolometric flux during interval 1 is 2.03@xmath32 ergs@xmath16s@xmath5 , thus the bolometric luminosity is 2.1@xmath33 ergss@xmath5 .",
    "this may underestimate the true peak flux / luminosity somewhat , due to the limited time resolution of our data ; judging by the light curve , the true peak values are unlikely to be greater by @xmath111.5 compared with the interval 1 averages .",
    "the burst fluence ( integrated over the 160s interval for which we have data ) is estimated to be 1.45@xmath34 ergs@xmath16 ( equivalently , total burst energy of 1.45@xmath35 ergs ) ; the fact that we did not see the return to quiescence may have resulted in underestimating this by @xmath210% .",
    "thus the average duration @xmath36 of the burst was @xmath271 s.",
    "the quiescent x - ray spectrum of x1832@xmath0330  appears to have a complex shape .",
    "a pointed x - ray observation of x1832@xmath0330  with a wide spectral coverage appears worthwhile : if the complex shape is indeed due to a partial covering absorber , we then need to understand where it could be located , particularly if x1832@xmath0330  is a low inclination system .    we have observed a type i x - ray burst ; although this is not the first from this system to be reported @xcite , ours is the first time - resolved spectral analysis of a burst from x1832@xmath0330 .",
    "the spectral cooling we observe is typical of type i bursts , and can be considered the definitive evidence that x1832@xmath0330  is a neutron star binary .",
    "the burst appeared to have peaked at around @xmath210% eddington luminosity , but with a typical total fluence .",
    "we have approximately 160 s of data after the onset of the burst , and x1832@xmath0330  clearly had not completed its return to the quiescent state by the end of this data segment ; the duration @xmath36 was about 70 s. while this duration is relatively long among all x - ray bursts , it is actually typical of systems with low persistent luminosities ( @xmath37 , the ratio of persistent flux to eddington luminosity , is about is about 1% for x1832@xmath0330 ) : @xmath36 ranges from 30s to a few minutes at @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the _ asca _  burst was a typical type i event .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested a relatively faint star , star 49 , as a possible optical counterpart .",
    "this faintness may be intrinsic , or geometric : since most of the optical light from an lmxb is due to reprocessing in the @xmath2flat accretion disk , a high binary inclination can lead to an apparently faint optical counterpart .",
    "we can comment on this possibility , as the gis-3 light curve probably is the most suitable x - ray data for orbital period search ever obtained for x1832@xmath0330 . since we do not detect orbital modulations , such as eclipses , dips , or quasi - sinusoidal modulations ,",
    "we conclude that x1832@xmath0330  is unlikely to be a high inclination system .",
    "x1832@xmath0330  was seen at x - ray luminosity levels ( @xmath210@xmath39 ergss@xmath5 ) typical of x - ray bursters during the _ rosat _  and _ asca _  observations .",
    "this lends additional support against x1832@xmath0330  being a high - inclination , accretion disc corona source .",
    "moreover , we ( as well as @xcite ) observed what appears to be a typical type i x - ray burst , suggesting that we do directly observe the neutron star in x1832@xmath0330 .",
    "these provide additional arguments against x1832@xmath0330  being a high inclination system .    if this lmxb is at a low inclination , then a natural explanation for the optical faintness would be that it is ultra - compact , perhaps similar to x1820@xmath0303 in ngc 6624 @xcite .",
    "since optical luminosity is dominated by reprocessing , smaller systems tend to be optically fainter .",
    "we consider this to be a circumstantial evidence for x1832@xmath0330being an ultracompact binary , joining those in ngc  6624 , ngc  6712 , and perhaps ngc  1851 @xcite .",
