    "in the vicinity of the globular cluster m3 , ar boo ( gsc 1999 - 0011 ; @xmath2=@xmath312.76 , @xmath4@xmath2=@xmath30.89 ) was announced by kurochkin ( 1960 ) to be an eclipsing binary with an asserted period of 0.416718 d. houck & pollock ( 1986 ) obtained a photographic light curve and determined a new period of 0.3447 d. kurochkin s period turned out to be incorrect probably because there were only 97 magnitude estimates over a ten - year interval . since then , ccd light curves have been made by wolf et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and by samec et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bandpasses , respectively .",
    "the former authors reported that the orbital period history of the system can be represented either by an abrupt period increase about 1983 or by a positive quadratic term indicating a continuous period increase .",
    "samec et al . analyzed their light curves using the wilson - devinney synthesis code ( wilson & devinney 1971 , hereafter wd ) and classified the binary as a member of the w - subtype cateory defined empirically by binnendijk ( 1970 ) .",
    "such binaries show light curves in which the deeper minimum corresponds to an occultation of the smaller , less massive component by the larger , more massive one .",
    "in addition , these latter authors suggested that a second - order light variation is due to a single hot spot on the more massive component and that the orbital period is increasing . in this article , we present improved photometric properties of ar boo from detailed studies of the period and light variations , based on our new ccd observations as well as on historical data .",
    "we performed time - series ccd photometry of ar boo on 27 nights between february 2006 and april 2008 , using an fli img4301e ccd camera and a @xmath7 filter set attached to the 1.0-m reflector at the mt .",
    "lemmon optical astronomy observatory ( loao ) in arizona , usa . the detecting system had been installed by the korea astronomy and space science institute ( kasi ) and was operated by remote control from daejeon , korea via an internet connection ( han et al .",
    "the ccd chip has 2084@xmath82084 pixels and a pixel size of 24 @xmath9 m .",
    "the image field - of - view is 22@xmath10.2@xmath822.2 at the f/7.5 cassegrain focus of the telescope . with the conventional iraf package , we processed the ccd frames to correct for bias level , dark noise , and pixel - to - pixel inhomogeneities of quantum efficiency and applied simple aperture photometry to obtain instrumental magnitudes for about a hundred stars near to the variable .",
    "the nearby stars gsc 1999 - 0009 and gsc 1999 - 0067 ( on the same ccd frame as the variable ) were selected as comparison ( c ) and check ( k ) stars , respectively .",
    "for these stars no light variability had been reported in the previous observations by samec et al .",
    "and we also detected no variations in the brightness difference between them during our observing runs .",
    "the observations of our first season were dedicated to obtaining new times of minimum light . from the 2007 and 2008 seasons",
    ", a total of 1838 individual observations was obtained in the three bandpasses ( 617 in @xmath4 , 619 in @xmath2 , and 602 in @xmath11 ) and a sample of them is listed in table 1 .",
    "the light curves are displayed in the upper panel of figure 1 as magnitude differences _ versus _ orbital phase , where the open circle and plus symbols show the individual observations of the 2007 and 2008 seasons , respectively .",
    "the differences ( 07-08 ) between the two seasons are plotted in the middle panel . to obtain these seasonal differences , we interpolated in phase and magnitude difference between phase - consecutive measures of the 2008 season to the phase of an appropriate 2007 observation and performed the subtraction .",
    "all ( k  c ) magnitude differences appear in the lower panel . whereas the reference stars were evidently constant , ar boo",
    "has clearly varied seasonally .",
    "from our ccd observations , times of minimum light in each filter were determined by the method of kwee & van woerden ( 1956 ) .",
    "twenty - two weighted mean timings from these determinations and 84 epochs ( 12 photographic plate , 13 visual , 3 photographic , and 56 ccd ) from the literature were used for a period analysis of ar boo .",
    "most of the eclipse timings were extracted from the data base referenced by kreiner et al .",
    "all available ccd timings are listed in table 2 , where the second column gives the standard deviation of each timing . because the other timings were published with no errors , the following standard deviations were assigned to timing residuals based on observational method : @xmath120.0130 d for photographic plate , @xmath120.0096 d for visual , and @xmath120.0012 d for photographic minima . for ephemeris computations , relative weights",
    "were then calculated as the inverse squares of these values consistent with errors and weights for the ccd timings .",
    "as previously mentioned , the period variation of ar boo has been interpreted to be due to either a sudden period jump or a continuous period increase . after testing several ephemeris forms",
    ", we found that the history of the period shows a short - term oscillation superposed on a upward parabolic variation , rather than varying in monotonic or bi - linear fashions .",
    "this type of period variation appears in contact and near - contact binaries such as er ori ( kim et al .",
    "2003 ) , bx peg ( lee et al .",
    "2004 ) , tu boo ( lee et al .",
    "2007 ) , and v432 per ( lee et al . 2008 ) , for which orbital period changes of the systems can be satisfactorily explained as combinations of secular variations and light - travel time ( hereafter ltt ) effects . in general , there also exists the possibility that a binary orbit has shrunk from an initially wider dimension by secularly transferring the angular momentum of an inner , close pair to a distant companion of a triple system ( cf .",
    "pribulla & rucinski 2006 ) .",
    "a recent study by these authors shows that about 42% of 151 known contact binaries brighter than @xmath13 + 10 exist in multiple systems .",
    "we , therefore , initially assumed the oscillation to be due to an ltt effect and all eclipse timings were fitted to a quadratic _ plus _ ltt ephemeris as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ltt due to a hypothetical distant companion to the eclipsing close binary ( irwin 1952 , 1959 ) and includes five parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the orbital parameters of the eclipsing pair around the mass center of the triple system .",
    "the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote keplerian mean motion of the mass center of the eclipsing pair and the epoch of its periastron passage , respectively .",
    "the levenberg - marquart algorithm ( press et al . 1992 ) was used to evaluate the eight parameters of the ephemeris and the final results are summarized in table 3 , together with other derived quantities . the @xmath21@xmath22 residuals calculated from the linear terms in equation ( 1 ) are plotted in the upper panel of figure 2 .",
    "the middle and lower panels display the ccd residuals from the linear _ plus _ quadratic term and from the complete ephemeris , respectively .",
    "the @xmath21@xmath23 residuals are given in the fourth column of table 2 .",
    "as displayed in figure 2 , the quadratic _ plus _ ltt ephemeris currently provides a good representation of all the @xmath21@xmath22 residuals .",
    "this cyclical variation can be interpreted as an ltt effect due to an additional object with a mass of at least @xmath0=0.081 @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum mass of the third companion is close to the theoretical limit of about 0.072 @xmath1 for a brown dwarf star .",
    "because of noise in even the recent timings and also because only about 1.5 cycles of the 7.57-year period have been covered , these results are certainly preliminary .",
    "this interpretation is not unique .",
    "it is alternatively possible that a cyclical period modulation may be caused by a magnetic activity cycle in a binary system with at least one star having a spectral type later than about f5 .",
    "applegate ( 1992 ) and lanza et al . ( 1998 ) have both discussed this possibility .",
    "the latter reference constrains and elaborates the concepts of the former one but both developments remains too conservative for a binary such as ar boo .",
    "they are limited to considering detached objects such as rs cvn and ar lac and , for the present system , quadrupole gravitational moments do not express the complex mass distributions of the ar boo stars .",
    "if this concern is ignored , curve - fitting of the period residuals remains the same as for the mechanical model just described above , but no orbital meaning is attached to the shape and phasing of the curve . in order to calculate model parameters for magnetic activity , we applied the period ( @xmath24 ) and amplitude ( @xmath25 ) for the cyclical variation to applegate s formulae .",
    "the results are presented in table 4 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath4 denote the amplitude of orbital period modulation , the variation of the gravitational quadrupole moment , the rate of angular momentum transfer , the moment of inertia of the convective shell , the variable fraction of differential rotation , the work needed to transfer the angular momentum , the rms luminosity variation and mean subsurface magnetic field intensity , respectively . in addition to these paramaters , the quantity @xmath33 denotes a bolometric magnitude difference relative to the mean light level of ar boo converted to magnitude scale with equation ( 4 ) in the paper of kim et al .",
    "the light variation ( @xmath34 ) ascribed to the hotter , primary star is a factor of 5 greater than the value ( @xmath35 ) proposed by applegate , while that ( @xmath36 ) for the secondary is close to his theoretical value .",
    "( actually , lanza et al . suggest that applegate s limiting values may be relaxed considerably . )",
    "these results indicate that a magnetic dynamo seated in the secondary star can also adequately explain the observed period modulations of ar boo .",
    "distinguishing between the mechanical and magnetic interpretations of the 7.57-year oscillation requires additional information , which will be suggested later after the light curve fittings .    in equation ( 1 ) , the coefficient of the quadratic term is positive and represents a continuous period increase with a rate of @xmath37/@xmath38 = 2.68@xmath810@xmath39 d yr@xmath40 .",
    "it is conventional to ascribe such a variation to conservative mass transfer between the stellar components in the system . the transfer rate from the less massive star to the more massive component of ar boo",
    "is calculated to be about 1.48@xmath810@xmath39 m@xmath41 yr@xmath40 from the relation between @xmath37/@xmath38 and the masses of the component stars calculated later .",
    "this value is larger than those recently derived for other w - subtype contact systems [ e.g. , 1.3@xmath810@xmath39 for ad cnc ( qian et al .",
    "2007 ) , 2.9@xmath810@xmath42 for ty boo ( yang et al . 2007 ) , and 2.3@xmath810@xmath42 for cc com and 2.0@xmath810@xmath42 for bv dra ( yang et al . 2009 ) , all in m@xmath41 yr@xmath40 units ] and is a generally accepted one for classical semi - detached algols ( cf . richard & albright 1999 ) .",
    "one might imagine that the calculated @xmath37/@xmath38 could be apportioned between ( a ) mass transfer from the hot to the cool eclipsing member and ( b ) angular momentum transfer to the possible third companion but there is no independent support for this idea .",
    "as do previous light curves of ar boo , the new ones show continuously curving eclipses and also conspicuous seasonal light variations . within about 0.004 mag , the light curves of 2007 present equal light levels at the quadratures ( max i and max ii ) while those of 2008 show the inverse oconnell effect with max i fainter than max ii by about 0.028 , 0.023 , and 0.018 mag for the @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath11 bandpasses , respectively .",
    "moreover , the light maxima are slightly displaced to orbital phases 0.264 and 0.745 in 2007 and 0.257 and 0.745 in 2008 .",
    "these features are usually indicative of spot activity on the component stars and the striking seasonal light changes in ar boo indicate that that activity has varied significantly with time .",
    "photometric solutions of ar boo have been reported only by samec et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and no spectroscopic observations have been published for the system .",
    "we analyzed our data in a manner similar to that for the cool binaries tu boo ( lee et al .",
    "2007 ) and v432 per ( lee et al . 2008 ) .",
    "our light curves were normalized to unit light at phase 0.75 and were solved by using contact mode 3 of the wd code .",
    "the surface temperature of the more massive star was fixed at 5100 k from flower s ( 1996 ) table , according to ( @xmath43)=@xmath30.886@xmath120.010 given by samec et al .",
    "and @xmath44(@xmath43)=@xmath30.015 calculated following schlegel et al .",
    "the logarithmic bolometric ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and monochromatic ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) limb - darkening coefficients were interpolated from the values of van hamme ( 1993 ) and were used in concert with the model atmosphere option . to avoid possible confusion",
    ", we refer to the primary and secondary stars as those being eclipsed at min i and min ii , respectively .    we first conducted a detailed @xmath49-search procedure over the range 0.3 @xmath50 3.8 . in this process , we did not consider either a third light source ( @xmath51 ) or spots .",
    "the search was made simultaneously for all light curves of each season and the results are plotted in figure 3 . from the figure , we can see that the @xmath49-search result of 2007 is different from that of 2008 and that local minima occur around @xmath49=1.3 and @xmath49=2.7 in 2008",
    ". this may be caused by the year - to - year variability of the system and the noisiness of the 2008 light curve .",
    "because of this confusion , the @xmath49-search of the 2008 observations is considered indeterminate .",
    "we did find that the light - curve synthesis in 2007 is slightly better if @xmath521.0 and that an acceptable solution is close to @xmath49=2.6 .",
    "this indicates that ar boo is an w - subtype contact binary . to obtain an unspotted solution , we analyzed all six light curves simultaneously by treating the initial value of @xmath49 as an adjustable parameter .",
    "the results are listed in table 5 and the residuals from the fitting are plotted in the left panels of figure 4 . as indicated by these panels , the computed light curves do not fit our data satisfactorily .    in many contact binaries , second - order light variations have been attributed to local atmospheric inhomogeneities that may result from either magnetic dynamo - related activity or mass transfer between the component stars .",
    "because the second - order light effects are themselves seasonally variable for ar boo , they can not be caused by a gas stream from the less massive primary impacting the inner hemisphere of the more massive secondary component unless the flow rate were itself variable .",
    "also , our period study suggests checking for a third light source in the system .",
    "accordingly , we re - analyzed our light curves by considering both a spot and such a source .",
    "the result is given as the one - spot model of table 6 and the light residuals from the model are plotted in the middle panels of figure 4 . from these displays , we see that a single cool spot on the larger secondary component with a third light source does improve the light - curve fitting greatly but that large discrepancies still remain in the first half - period of the 2007 data .",
    "this detail can reasonably be modeled by an additional hot spot on the surface of the secondary .",
    "it remains an open question whether such a spot results from mass transfer or is an intrinsic feature of the cool star .",
    "the final result is listed as the two - spot model of table 6 and the residuals from this binary model are plotted in the right panels of figure 4 .",
    "our solutions for ar boo show that @xmath51 contributes 2.0 - 2.8 % light in @xmath4 , 1.2 - 1.5 % in @xmath2 , and 0.9 - 1.0 % in @xmath11 .",
    "these values seem to point to a source relatively hotter than the binary components but the problem with this interpretation is that the @xmath51 values are not individually statistically significant .",
    "a final light curve fitting with @xmath51=0 led to parameter evaluations which , within the errors , did not change from those given in the table .",
    "the second - order light variations are best fitted by the simultaneous existence of a cool spot and a hot spot on the cool secondary star .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that the two - spot model of 2008 gives a value of @xmath53 identical to that for the one - spot model and does not improve the light - curve fitting appreciably .",
    "although the effect is not clearly seen in fig .",
    "1 , the 2008 light curves are appreciably noisier than those of the preceding year and the difference is evident in all the panels of fig .",
    "4 . this difference makes a large contribution to the unchanged fitting criterion for 2008 and also to the large errors associated with the 2008 hot spot .",
    "although we could have ignored that spot in 2008 , we decided to leave its formal determination just as the wd code found it .    to take the understanding of ar boo further and to examine whether our solutions can reasonably describe the samec et al .",
    "light curves , we analyzed them using our photometric parameters as initial values .",
    "the results are given in columns ( 2)-(3 ) of table 7 and plotted in figure 5 as continuous curves .",
    "within the errors yielded by the wd code , the stellar parameters from the samec et al .",
    "data are in satisfactory accord with those from our light curves .",
    "we see again that the formal @xmath51 values are not significant and that the differences among the ( now 3 ) seasonal light curves can be explained almost entirely by spot variability , especially by the longitude drifts of the spots with time .    the light curves of wolf et al .",
    "( 1998 ) do not have the observational weight of ours and we held only limited expectations for their study . since the samec et al . and",
    "our light curves had converged to consistent geometric and photometric parameters , we assumed these values to be appropriate for the wolf et al .",
    "ones and analyzed these latter only for spot descriptions .",
    "the results are listed in columns ( 4)-(5 ) of table 7 and lead to the continuous curves in figure 6 .",
    "these fit the observations satisfactorily . nonetheless , as in modelling the 2008 light curves , the wolf et al .",
    "data do not need a hot spot , which may be a main cause of the large errors for the spot parameters .",
    "the 4-season mean values of @xmath51@xmath54 2 % , if real , could come from a third object either gravitationally bound to or only optically related with the eclipsing pair ar boo .",
    "we do not see such an object optically resolved on our time - series ccd images .",
    "further , ar boo is at a very high galactic latitude so background or foreground contamination is not likely .",
    "a previous section of this report quantified a possible projected orbit for a bound third body .",
    "if that supposed object be identified with the  third light \" source , it would have to be more than 3 magnitudes fainter than the hot eclipsing component and somewhat bluer than that star , i.e. a sub - dwarf .",
    "the evidence of the errors in tables 6 and 7 forces the simpler understanding : the  third light \" values are only artifacts of the light curve fitting process .",
    "if such an object exists , it has not yet been photometrically identified from all these light curves .",
    "the more massive secondary component with a spectral type of k1 v was assumed to conform to harmanec s ( 1988 ) relation for masses and radii as functions of spectral type .",
    "the remaining absolute parameters were then derived from the two - spot model of 2007 in table 6 .",
    "all the stellar characteristics are listed in table 8 wherein the bolometric corrections were obtained from the relation between @xmath55 and bc given by kang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . the apparent visual magnitude @xmath2=+12.76 at max ii ( samec et al .",
    "2006 ) and our computed light ratio lead to @xmath56=+13.87 , and @xmath57=+13.27 for the primary and secondary stars , respectively .",
    "the distance to the system was calculated to be about 350 pc from the interstellar absorption of @xmath58=0.05 and the values of @xmath57 and @xmath59 .",
    "the masses and radii in table 8 are not close to those of main sequence stars but they do conform to the general pattern of contact binaries shown long ago by hilditch et al .",
    "( 1988 ) when it is remembered that those authors define primary and secondary stars by mass and not by temperature .",
    "if the assumption is made that the hot star is a normal main sequence one , the sum of the masses is unrealistically large .",
    "figure 3 shows that there can be considerable uncertainty in determining the mass ratio as was noted in that section of the text . with a presently unknowable impact",
    ", this uncertainty propagates into the geometrical parameters of the synthesis and ultimately into the stellar radii and masses .",
    "quite likely , radial velocities would diminish this uncertainty since the spectrum should be double - lined if the light ratio is correct .",
    "this paper gives a summary of the discontinuous history of light curve morphology of ar boo from 1997 into 2008 .",
    "one description of the second - order morphology emphasizes that cool spots have manifested themselves over a siderographic band from @xmath60 to @xmath61 in longitude and 80@xmath62 to 92@xmath62 in co - latitude on the cool star .",
    "simultaneously and in the same coordinate sense , hot spots have been seen over the band @xmath63 to @xmath64 and 99@xmath62 to 115@xmath62 on the same star .",
    "whether or not these hot spots are chromospheric plages in the solar sense is not known for ar boo but we will use that noun here even if they turn out to be photospheric features .",
    "with respect to the stellar equator , the cool spots and plages have appeared in opposite hemispheres but close to and nearly parallel to that great circle .",
    "when account is taken of errors , the co - latitude excursions have been so small that the features may be said to have shown no latitude drift at all .",
    "the longitudes of the disturbed regions , on the other hand , have shown significant changes with time .",
    "solar - type magnetograms can not be made for an unresolved star and a very large telescope would be needed to measure the normalized circular polarization component for ar boo .",
    "one must seek surrogates for these conventional indicators of a magnetic environment and the light curves are the only source of other markers .",
    "it is a reasonable working inference that the spots and plages are surface manifestations of an embedded magnetic field and activity consistent with the second understanding of the 7.57-year period variation .",
    "possible quantifications of this activity might be ( a ) the fluxes emitted by either or both of the hot and cool spots , ( b ) the sum of these fluxes and ( c ) the ratio of the fluxes .",
    "from the entries in tables 6 , 7 and 8 the appropriate parameters have been extracted so as to calculate the spot and plage fluxes and their sums and ratios on the assumption of black body emissivity .",
    "the samec et al . and our light curves fall upon the decreasing - period branch of the 7.57-year waveform and the models of these light curves show ordered relations for 3 of the criteria with time and , more suggestively , with amplitude in that waveform as follows . with advancing time , the progressively more negative excursions in the waveform are associated with ( a ) increases in the plage fluxes and decreases in the cool spot fluxes , ( b ) no monotonic change in the flux sum and ( c ) decreasing values of ( plage flux / cool spot flux ) .",
    "( in the formulation by lanza et al .",
    "these points , falling as they do on the negative slope fraction of the 7.57-year cycle , signal an increase of the cool star s quadrupole moment with concomitant changes in the magnetic dynamo . )",
    "the weakness of the associations is evident : the spot characterizations from wolf et al .",
    "do not conform to the relation defined by only the 3 points sampling the first half of the following cycle but , it is possible to extenuate this seeming failure in the following way .",
    "one does not know what would be the appearance of the entire cycle of spot and plage activity as a function of the 7.57-year oscillation .",
    "would it be a simple closed oval , a degenerate single curve , or a twisted closed curve ? perhaps then , the failure is only a seeming one and is really evidence that magnetic activity changes from one 7.57-year cycle to the next in the same manner that solar magnetic activity is not a constant of nature . if this would be so , there would also be no sense to the propagation of that cycle forward or backward in time as we have done in the middle panel of figure 2 .",
    "it may be imagined that the cyclical component of the period variability , discussed first in section 3 , could be produced by apparent phase shifts of the real conjunctions due to asymmetrical eclipse minima originating from starspot activity and/or the method of measuring the timings of minima ( cf , lee et al .",
    "2004 , 2008 ) . to examine this possibility",
    ", we calculated anew the minimum epoch for each eclipse curve of wolf et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , samec et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and loao with the wd code by means of adjusting only the ephemeris epoch ( @xmath65 ) and not allowing a phase shift as in table 6 .",
    "the results are listed in the second column of table 9 together with the previously - tabulated timings for comparison and are illustrated with the plus symbols in figure 2 .",
    "we can see that the differences among them are smaller than the observed amplitude ( about 0.003 d ) of the 7.57-year variation which therefore survives after spot correction .",
    "there are , moreover , systematic runs with time between the observed timings and the wd ones . in our data of table 9 ,",
    "the column 4 differences in 2007 are positive for both minima , while those in 2008 are positive for min i except for one eclipse ( hjd 2454555.8471 ) and negative for min ii . in 2007 , a cool spot and a hot spot are displayed to the observer before and after the first quadrature , respectively , which cause the positive values for both eclipses . in 2008 , however , a cool spot is seen at the first quadrature .",
    "this spot produces positive values for min i but negative values for min ii .",
    "both the diminution in scatter among the timings and our spot interpretation of the timing displacements can be considered consistent with the expectation of maceroni & vant veer ( 1994 ) that minimum timings are systematically shifted by light curve asymmetries due to starspot activity .",
    "our results lend weight to the proposition that the light curve synthesis method leads to better timing determinations than does the kwee & van woerden method that has been almost universally applied to individual eclispses for more than 50 years .",
    "this work on ar boo presents the most convincing confirmation in the current literature of the predictions of those authors .",
    "our interpretation also implicitly expresses the observational precision and the time density of measures that have to be attained so as to prevent spot effects from contaminating keplerian ephemerides .",
    "only if this be done can one seek out higher - order period variations .",
    "we suggest that all future period studies of this star use the timings of column 2 of table 9 rather than those of table 2 .",
    "there is another recognition to be made .",
    "it will be impossible in general to correct casually - observed minimum timings for spot bias so some small systematic error will afflict the results of dedicated minimum monitoring programs .",
    "in this article , we have analyzed new ccd observations of the eclipsing binary system ar boo obtained during three successive seasons beginning in 2006 february .",
    "the light curves show partial eclipses and season - to - season light variability .",
    "our light - curve solution indicates that ar boo is a w - subtype contact binary composed of a hotter g9 primary star and a cooler k1 companion , the derived spectral types depend , of course , on the adopted temperature for the secondary component and the observed ( @xmath43 ) color index .",
    "the disturbed light curves of the system were best modeled by using a two - spot model with cool and hot spots on the secondary star .",
    "we speculate that both spots may be produced by magnetic dynamo - related activity .    according to the thermal relaxation oscillation ( tro ) theory ( lucy 1976 ; lucy & wilson 1979 ) , contact binaries must oscillate cyclically between contact and non - contact conditions .",
    "because our detailed study of period and light variations show that the orbital period is increasing and that mass is transferring from the less massive primary to the more massive secondary star , ar boo may presently be in a transition state evolving from a contact to a non - contact configuration as suggested by this theory .",
    "our new orbital period study with all available timings reveals that the @xmath21@xmath22 residuals have varied in a cyclical oscillation superposed on a secular period increase .",
    "the semi - amplitude and period of the cyclical variation are low and short , respectively , and their values command modest confidence because the observed ccd timings cover only about 1.5 cycle of this period .",
    "the oscillation may be produced , in principle , either by the ltt effect due to a stellar- or substellar - mass companion of @xmath0=0.081 @xmath1 or by a active magnetic cycle in the more massive secondary component but not by the asymmetries of eclipse light curves due to starspot activity .",
    "the circumstance that there has existed even a limited association between phase in the 7.57-year cycle and the spot activity seen in the light curves diminishes confidence in the postulated 3rd body while suggesting that a more searching attempt be made to understand magnetic activity mediating angular momentum exchange between the spin of the stellar mass distribution and the orbit .",
    "there s a further message to be drawn here .",
    "three of the authors had never even heard of this binary before the loao observations were in train .",
    "it is a very nondescript object , yet the assiduous accumulation of the best possible observations has given weight to two ideas : starspots measurably inflect eclipse timings and magnetic cycles in stellar components of close binaries express themselves dynamically .",
    "every binary has its individual information encoded for us but , a priori , we have no idea of the richness of that information and we must uncover it and piece it together with information from all the others that we observe .    in a perfect world there would be seasonal accumulation of light curves ( and radial velocities ) of ar boo over the next 8 years and then surely understanding of this system and its activity would be advanced .",
    "it is even possible that the declination of the binary permits accumulation of two independent light curves per observing season .",
    "a justification for such a strenuous effort may be found in looking back at the 2007 and 2008 light curves . whereas those of the earlier year were compiled over the 6 nights from march 11 through march 17 ,",
    "the data for 2008 were observed over 17 nights from december 23 , 2007 through april 12 , 2008 .",

    "<S> the star s photometric properties are derived from detailed studies of the period variability and of all available light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we find that over about 56 years the orbital period of the system has varied due to a combination of an upward parabola and a sinusoid rather than in a monotonic fashion . </S>",
    "<S> mass transfer from the less massive primary to the more massive secondary component is likely responsible for at least a significant part of the secular period change . </S>",
    "<S> the cyclical variation with a period of 7.57 yrs and a semi - amplitude of 0.0015 d can be produced either by a light - travel - time effect due to an unseen companion with a scaled mass of @xmath0=0.081 @xmath1 or by a magnetic period modulation in the secondary star . </S>",
    "<S> historical light curves of ar boo , as well as our own , display season - to - season light variability , which are best modeled by including both a cool spot and a hot one on the secondary star . </S>",
    "<S> we think that the spots express magnetic dynamo - related activity and offer limited support for preferring the magnetic interpretation of the 7.57-year cycle over the third - body understanding . </S>",
    "<S> our solutions confirm that ar boo belongs to the w - subtype contact binary class , consisting of a hotter , less massive primary star with a spectral type of g9 and a companion of spectral type k1 . </S>"
