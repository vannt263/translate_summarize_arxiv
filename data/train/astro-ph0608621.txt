    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) can be roughly divided into two types : a supergiant star and a be star are contained respectively .",
    "the x - ray source often is a pulsar and powered by accretion of the material offered by the companion star . in the supergiant systems ,",
    "either roche - lobe or stellar wind accretion occurs , while in the be systems commonly only the latter process takes place since the be star is well inside its roche lobe @xcite .",
    "the relation between the spin periods @xmath1 and the orbital periods @xmath0 of hmxbs was first studied by @xcite , who pointed out that there may be a @xmath4 correlation for neutron stars in systems with radially expanding winds , while @xmath5 for be systems .",
    "@xcite noticed that the spin and orbital periods agree reasonably well with the former correlation for the supergiant systems in which the x - ray source is powered by stellar wind accretion .",
    "the @xmath3 relation has been studied by @xcite in terms of the equilibrium spin period , where the corotation radius equals to the magnetospheric radius defined by equating the ram pressure of accreting matter with the magnetic pressure of the dipole field of the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in order to obtain quantitative agreement between the predicted and observed spin periods for given orbital periods , the assumption of the equilibrium spin periods requires a mass accretion rate two orders of magnitude lower than observed for supergiant systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a comprehensive explanation for the @xmath3 relation for hmxbs . for supergiant systems they suggested that the difference between the required and the observed mass accretion rates can be explained by assuming that the present - day periods are the equilibrium spin periods for the stellar wind of the optical star when it was still on main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "the @xmath3 correlation for be / x - ray binaries was suggested to result from the equilibrium spin realized by interaction between the neutron star magnetic field and the be star s equatorial wind - the wider orbits expose to the neutron stars to a lower wind density on average and hence lower accretion rate .",
    "the latter point was criticized by @xcite , who proposed that the observed @xmath3 relation was probably the result of an earlier evolutionary stage , as for supergiant binaries . by calculating the angular momentum carried by the be star s wind material",
    ", @xcite showed that for be / x - ray binaries in relatively narrow orbits ( @xmath6 100 days ) , the equilibrium spin could be reached by angular momentum transfer via a disk , formed in the equatorial wind of the be stars ; in wider binaries , the low angular momentum of the wind matter prevents the existence of an accretion disk , and the neutron star s spin remains close to its previous equilibrium value at an earlier evolutionary stage .",
    "@xcite have calculated the detailed spin evolution of a wind - fed neutron star in ob binaries prior to the hmxb phase , by simulating the time - development of the mass loss rate and radius expansion of a 20 @xmath7 donor star .",
    "the above - mentioned investigations are usually either semi - analytic or numerical only for individual cases . to better understand the distribution of hmxbs in the @xmath3 diagram , an evolutionary population synthesis incorporated with neutron star spin evolution is needed . in the present paper , we have conducted a monte carlo population synthesis study of the spin evolution of a neutron star in a massive binary . due to the large theoretical uncertainties on the formation and evolution of hmxbs , our work is limited to the spin evolution of neutron stars before the hmxb phase .",
    "the theoretical considerations are described in  2 .",
    "the calculated results are presented in  3 and their implications for accretion processes in hmxbs are discussed in  4 .",
    "we consider a @xmath8 magnetized neutron star in binaries with a massive ms companion star . we adopt a simplified version of the theoretical model outlined by @xcite to calculate the neutron star s spin evolution before steady",
    "accretion occurs , as briefly described below .",
    "_ case a : the pulsar phase _",
    "the newborn neutron star first appears as a rapidly rotating , radio pulsar after its birth in a supernova explosion , provided that its radiation is strong enough to expel the wind material coming from the companion star outside the radius of the light cylinder @xmath9 or the bondi accretion radius @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant , @xmath12 the mass of the neutron star and @xmath13cms@xmath14 the relative wind velocity at the neutron star s orbit .",
    "the neutron star spins down due to magnetic dipole radiation and/or particle emission , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the moment of inertia , @xmath17g@xmath18 the magnetic dipole moment , and @xmath19 the angular velocity of the neutron star , respectively .",
    "the pulsar phase will break down in two distinct circumstances .",
    "\\(i ) the pulsar phase will cease when the wind material penetrates inside @xmath20 , and the resulting @xmath1 is derived by balancing radiation pressure from the pulsar with the stellar wind ram pressure at @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 gs@xmath14 is the mass flow rate onto the neutron star .",
    "\\(ii ) the pulsar phase will end when the pressure gradient become important as the outer boundary @xmath23 of the envelope where the density @xmath24 approaching to @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 , and the corresponding @xmath1 is @xcite , @xmath27    _ case b : the propeller phase _",
    "the propeller phase follows the pulsar phase . during this period the magnetospheric radius @xmath28^{1/7}$ ] , is larger than the corotation radius @xmath29 .",
    "the plasma interacts with the neutron star magnetosphere , but further accretion is inhibited by the centrifugal barrier , and the infalling matter is accelerated outward , taking away the angular momentum of the neutron star . though the propeller effect has be investigated extensively , there exist large uncertainties in the efficiency of angular momentum loss during the propeller regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we assume that the infalling material is ejected with the corotating velocity at @xmath30 , and the spin - down torque is @xcite @xmath31 the typical spin - down time - scale @xmath32 can be estimated to be @xmath33 the spin - down process ends until @xmath1 reaches the equilibrium spin period @xmath34 and we assume that steady accretion takes place afterwards ( see however , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spin period of the neutron star may be further changed after @xmath35 in the following accretion phase .",
    "but we stop the calculations",
    "when either @xmath36 is reached within the ms lifetime or the companion star evolves off the ms ( so that strong wind accretion or roche lobe overflow occurs ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we do not consider narrow hmxbs with roche - lobe overflow ( like smc x@xmath371 , cen x@xmath373 , and lmc x@xmath374 ) , where the neutron stars are most likely to accrete from an accretion disk .",
    "for wind - fed systems like vela x@xmath371 , numerical calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that there are no significant angular momentum transfer onto the neutron star when radially - expanding wind material accretes onto the neutron star .",
    "this may result in only small deviation from the instantaneous ( equilibrium if reached ) spin periods at the beginning of the accretion phase .",
    "_ cgro / batse _ observations have shown a random walk in their spin frequencies with alternating spin - up and spin - down @xcite .",
    "the spin evolution in be / x - ray pulsars has a completely different picture , and will be discussed separately .      besides the spin evolution",
    ", we have considered the evolution of the inclination angle @xmath38 between the spin and magnetic axes in wind - fed neutron stars .",
    "this part of work is partially motivated by @xcite . by analyzing the light curves of 89 accretion - powered pulsars these authors obtained an upper limit on the inclination angles @xmath39 , suggesting that the magnetic axis tended to be aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "similar analyzes and conclusions have also been conducted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite presented the contemporaneous high - energy and radio observations of the hmxb 4u 2206 + 54 conducted with _",
    "integral _ and vla , which firmly indicate that 4u 2206 + 54 hosts a magnetic accreting neutron star .",
    "the absence of pulsations are most likely to be due to geometrical effect that the inclination angle of the neutron star is very small so that no pulsation can be detected .",
    "@xcite show that the inclination angle in a binary x - ray pulsar will vary as a result of its interaction with the surrounding plasma , becoming smaller ( larger ) during spin - down ( spin - up ) .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( 27 ) , ( 36c ) , and ( 37c ) in @xcite , we can derive the changing rate of @xmath38 as follows , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the critical value of the meridional angle measured from the north magnetic pole .",
    "we employed an evolutionary population synthesis method to investigate the distribution of the orbital periods and companion masses for the natal neutron star binaries ( i.e. at the moment when the neutron star was born ) .",
    "we started with a large set of primordial binaries and generated the systems that evolved to contain a neutron star and a ms companion .",
    "the initial mass function of @xcite was taken for the masses of the primary star ( the progenitor of the neutron star of mass @xmath42 ) .",
    "for the secondary star ( of mass @xmath43 ) , we assumed a uniform distribution of the mass ratio for @xmath44 . a uniform distribution of @xmath45 was also taken for the binary separation @xmath46 .",
    "we adopted the binary population synthesis code developed by @xcite to evolve the primordial binaries .",
    "this code incorporates evolution of single stars with binary - star interactions , such as mass transfer , mass accretion , common - envelope ( ce ) evolution , collisions , supernova kicks , tidal friction and angular momentum loss mechanisms .",
    "most of our adopted parameters are the same as the standard ones described in @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate parameter is @xmath47 yr@xmath14 , corresponding to a rate of @xmath48 yr@xmath14 for core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) in our galaxy , assume all the stars with masses @xmath49 die through sne . during the sn explosions , we apply a maxwellian distribution in the kick velocities with a mean of 265 kms@xmath14 imparted on the newborn neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the treatment of roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) mass transfer in the primordial binary is presented specifically in @xcite , and here we describe the stability criterion of mass transfer briefly .",
    "mass transfer via roche - lobe overflow takes place on either nuclear , thermal , or dynamical time - scales , depending on whether the primary remains in thermal equilibrium as it loses mass , and the radius of the primary increases faster than the roche - lobe .",
    "stars with deep surface convective zones , e.g. giants or naked helium giants , are generally unstable to dynamical timescale mass loss and will enter a ce evolution .",
    "the stable mass accretion rate of the secondary star is limited by eddington accretion rate .",
    "actually , the secondary may be spun up and become a be star when it accretes enough mass .",
    "this circumstance however , is not included in our consideration since the origin of be phenomena is still unclear and it is difficult to model the mass transfer processes in be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the ce parameter @xmath50 was set to be 1 as a typical value and we varied it from 0.1 to 2 in the calculations @xcite .",
    "our product is a set of  incipient \" neutron star in massive binaries with a particular distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath51 ( shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "other binary parameters , such as the radii , surface temperatures and luminosities of the companion stars can also be obtained .",
    "these parameters were then used to evaluate the mass loss rates from the companion stars and the mass flow rates onto the neutron stars .    for comparison with the observed properties of hmxbs ,",
    "our calculations are limited to systems with @xmath52 days and @xmath53 .",
    "the mass loss rate @xmath54 was estimated with the prescription described by @xcite , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the radius and luminosity of the companion star .",
    "all the quantities in eq .",
    "( 8) are evaluated in solar units .",
    "assume that the stellar wind expands isotropically at a speed of @xmath58 , the wind density @xmath59 at the orbit of the neutron star is @xmath60 and the mass flow rate onto neutron star is roughly given by @xcite @xmath61",
    "we have done calculations of the spin and inclination evolutions for @xmath62 neutron star binary systems based on the theoretical model presented in  2 . for the initial neutron star magnetic fields @xmath63 we assumed that @xmath64 is distributed normally with a mean of 12.5 and a standard deviation of 0.3 .",
    "no field decay is considered .",
    "the initial distribution of the inclination angle @xmath38 is randomly distributed in the range of @xmath65 .",
    "we set the initial spin periods to be distributed uniformly between @xmath66 and @xmath67 ms , though they have little influence on the final results .",
    "we stop our calculations when either @xmath1 reaches @xmath36 or the companion star begins to evolve off the ms with the arguments afore .",
    "the calculated results are presented in figs .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) in figs .",
    "2@xmath373 correspond to the relative wind velocity at the neutron star s orbit @xmath68 and 2 respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the final distribution of all the binaries in the @xmath3 diagram .",
    "the relative numbers of binary systems are displayed sketchily with the darkness of the shaded regions . according to our calculation",
    ", we find that , when @xmath68 , around @xmath69 neutron stars can reach the equilibrium periods to allow wind accretion within the ms lifetime @xmath70 , while others would still be in either the pulsar ( @xmath71 ) or the propeller ( @xmath72 ) phases .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig  2 , where the former two groups of neutron stars occupy the distinct upper and lower shaded regions .",
    "the small number of stars in the propeller phase originates from its much shorter duration @xcite .",
    "if @xmath73 is increased to be 2 , the mass flow rates onto the neutron stars will be lower by a factor of @xmath74 according to eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , further extending the spin - down time in the pulsar phase .",
    "so the corresponding numbers become @xmath75 , 55% and 3% , respectively .",
    "the larger wind velocity also induces longer equilibrium periods .",
    "figure 2 reveals that up to half of neutron stars in binary systems can not reach the equilibrium periods , indicating that there might be hundreds of  sleeping \" neutron star @xmath76 ms star binaries like psr b1259@xmath7663 in the galaxy ( see also fig .  4 below ) .",
    "they could be observed as radio pulsars or in x - rays depending on whether the interaction between the neutron star and the companion s winds becoming active .",
    "most of them have @xmath77 s and @xmath0 from tens of to hundreds of days .",
    "to compare the calculated results with observations of hmxbs , we show the distribution of those neutron star binaries with @xmath78 and of the observed hmxbs in fig .  3 .",
    "asterisks and diamonds mark the be and supergiant wind - fed hmxbs respectively , and crosses for roche - lobe overflow systems ( data are taken from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we first discuss the persistent , supergiant systems .",
    "obviously the spin periods of neutron stars can approach @xmath36 if the total spin - down timescale @xmath79 is less than the ms lifetime @xmath70 of the companion star . as we argued before , for this type of systems ,",
    "the current spin periods are likely to be around the equilibrium periods @xmath80 ( ms ) attained during the ms stage because of the inefficient angular momentum transfer in the accretion phase . for these systems to be observed as hmxbs , the accretion rate must have been increased to be high enough that the spin periods are larger than the ( current ) equilibrium period @xmath36 ( sg ) when the companion star becomes a supergiant @xcite , which is plotted with the dotted line in fig .  3 according to eq .  ( 6 ) . here",
    "we take @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 @xcite as typical values of the supergiant systems .",
    "this period roughly serves as the lower limit for @xmath1 of the neutron stars in supergiant hmxbs .",
    "moreover , since the mass accretion rates generally decrease with @xmath0 , only those in narrow orbits ( @xmath84 d ) can have x - ray luminosities @xmath85 ergs@xmath14 as observed .",
    "be / x - ray binaries generally have much longer orbital periods than the supergiant systems , and are usually transient x - ray sources observable during outbursts .",
    "the structure of the be star s winds is quite complicated , consisting of a relatively dense , slowly expanding , disk - like , equatorial wind and a fast , isotropically expanding , polar wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the @xmath3 correlation for be / x - ray binaries could be explained by setting @xmath86 obtained in the disk winds .",
    "however , current understanding of the be disk winds @xcite is very different from the radial wind model used by @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the be star s disk and the high eccentricities of the orbits also mean that the mass flow rate onto neutron stars in be systems are always highly variable on both long - term and short - term timescales .",
    "because of these complications we did not calculated the spin evolution of neutron stars accreting from the disk winds , but present constraints on their possible locations in the @xmath3 diagram instead .",
    "we first note that the calculated @xmath36 ( ms ) , under the assumption of isotropic winds , can be regarded as the upper limits for @xmath1 of be / x - ray binaries , since @xmath87 is much lower from the polar winds than from the disk winds ( these values should be taken as the averaged ones since we have ignored the eccentricity of the be star binaries ) .",
    "then , similar as in the supergiant systems , we can set the lower limit of @xmath1 for be / x - ray binaries to be the equilibrium period @xmath36 ( disk ) in outbursts when the the disk winds dominate accretion . from the observed data of 36 be / x - ray binaries compiled by @xcite , we have derived a correlation between the maximum luminosities and the orbital periods , @xmath88 insert eq .  ( 11 ) and @xmath83 into eq .",
    "( 6 ) we obtain @xmath89 which is plotted in the solid line in fig .  3 .",
    "we see that a large fraction of be / x - ray binaries lie between @xmath36 ( ms ) and @xmath36 ( d ) .",
    "the peculiar location of a 0535@xmath37669 may be due to its relatively low magnetic field .",
    "the cumulative luminosity distributions of hmxbs based on our population synthesis calculations are shown in fig .  4 with different values of the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath73 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the results show that change of these parameters do not significantly influence the final outcome , which are roughly compatible with the observed luminosity distributions of hmxbs in our galaxy @xcite .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the inclination angle distribution for x - ray pulsars in hmxbs .",
    "it is easily seen that most of the inclination angles are within 1 rad , in general agreement with the analysis of the observation data @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the inclination angle seems to be insensitive to the values of the relative wind velocity .",
    "we have calculated the spin evolution of neutron stars in a massive binary .",
    "the main ideas in this work are of two folds .",
    "first , to appear as x - ray binaries , the spin periods of neutron stars should be longer than the current ( instantaneous ) equilibrium periods .",
    "second , to satisfy this condition , the neutron stars should be spun - down enough during the previous propeller phase when the companion stars had relatively weak winds . these two requirements set constraints on the spin period distribution in wind - fed x - ray pulsars . since @xmath87 depends on the orbital separations , this may result in the particular distributions of the supergiant and be hmxbs in the @xmath3 diagram .",
    "the numerical results presented in figs .  2 and 3 , roughly accounting for the main features of the @xmath3 distribution of hmxbs , lend support to the original suggestions by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our calculations of the alignment during spin - down imply that most hmxbs may have relatively small inclination angles .",
    "we note that our preliminary results are subject of lots of uncertainties and simplified treatment adopted . in case of isotropic wind accretion , a considerable fraction of neutron stars can reach @xmath36 when the companion star is still on the ms .",
    "the detail number is determined not only by the binary evolutionary processes , but also critically by the propeller mechanism .",
    "the spin - down torque ( eq .  [ 4 ] ) adopted in this work is among the most efficient ones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and the results should be taken as to be the most optimistic . for less efficient spin - down torques ones ,",
    "the number of binaries in the propeller phase will obviously increase due to the longer spin - down timescales .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath36 depends on the mass loss rate , the wind velocity , and the magnetic field strength of the neutron star . with the mass loss rates given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) and typical magnetic fields of @xmath91 g , the neutron star s spin can be decelerated to be @xmath2 s within @xmath70 of the secondary star .",
    "the very long period @xmath92 s of 2s 0114@xmath76650 @xcite , however , may be explained by a ultra - strong initial magnetic field ( @xmath93 g ) , in order to be spun - down efficiently by the propeller effect @xcite .",
    "the structure of the be star s winds is much more complex and variable than in supergiant systems , and the simple propeller spin - down may not be applicable to this type of systems .",
    "it is likely that the @xmath3 distribution and correlation of be / x - ray binaries result from the balance between the spin - up during outbursts and spin - down during quiescence .",
    "assume that the spin - up and spin - down torques are @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively , we can derive the following expression for the equilibrium period ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath96 here the subscripts o and q denote quantities evaluated during outbursts and quiescence , respectively . all the three terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 13 ) are likely to increase with @xmath0 , which might account for the observed @xmath3 correlation of be / x - ray binaries .",
    "our calculated results also indicate the existence of hmxbs with ms donors in the galaxy . these systems , as the progenitors of supergiant hmxbs , are less luminous than the latter ( but with similar spin periods ) .",
    "figure 4 suggests that there could be a few hundred of these sources in the galaxy with x - ray luminosities ranging from @xmath97 to @xmath98 ergs@xmath14 ( if the propeller effect is not considered , the total number of x - ray binaries , most of which are be / x - ray binaries , can reach a few thousand ) . the hmxb 4u2206@xmath7654 is likely to be the prototype of this kind of sources @xcite .",
    "a number of papers have also suggestted that some neutron stars receive low kick speeds of @xmath99 kms@xmath14 at birth @xcite .",
    "if all the neutron stars are born with such small kicks , our calculations show that there would be about @xmath100 times more x - ray sources produced .",
