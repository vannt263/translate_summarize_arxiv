    "it is generally believed that there are two phase transitions in hot and dense hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "one is deconfinement which is related to the transition from hadronic to quark matter and the other is the chiral symmetry restoration . above the critical temperature @xmath4 , the hadronic states may survive in the high temperature phase of qcd @xcite . in general ,",
    "deconfinement has been described in terms of polyakov loop .",
    "lattice qcd simulations show that chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement occur at the same critical temperature @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative feature that at high temperature deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration come together is not much of a mystery : in the deconfinement phase quarks are hypothetically free and their masses tend to zero .",
    "it is a longstanding puzzle however why deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration occur quantitatively at the same temperature , though there are some explanations to connect these two phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "some of the signals related to the appearance of the deconfined phase are the phenomenon of strangeness enhancement and the @xmath6 suppression  @xcite .",
    "a direct signature of the formation of the deconfined phase is the existence of strangelets . many ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at brookhaven and cern",
    "are proposed to search for ( meta)stable lumps of such kind of strangelets . up to now , their is no experiment which confirms the existence of strangelets .",
    "ardouin et al .",
    "@xcite presented a novel method which can be applied to characterize the possible existence of a strange quark matter distillation process in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "asakawa et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the size of the average fluctuations of net baryon number and electric charge in a finite volume of hadronic matter differs widely between the confined and deconfined phases which in turn can be exploited as indicators for the formation of a quark - gluon plasma in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the e864 collaboration found that there was no evidence for neutral strangelet production in 11.5 gev / c per nucleon au+pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "the new measurement of na50 revealed a steady significant decrease in the @xmath6 production rate up to the most central pb - pb collisions and it clearly rules out the presently available conventional ( hadronic ) models of @xmath6 suppression .",
    "this new observation leads to a natural explanation in the framework of the formation of a deconfined state of quarks and gluons  @xcite .    in the context of the present work we investigate whether chiral symmetry restoration occurs only when quarks are deconfined , i.e.",
    ", whether the phase transition of chiral symmetry restoration can appear in hadronic matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that chiral symmetry breaking will strengthen in nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , the quark condensate will increase with baryon density for values higher than about 0.7@xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "the quark condensate in the nuclear medium has also been evaluated in the framework of mean - field theory , the nambu - jona - lasinio model , the relativistic brueckner hartree - fock approach , and the bare vertex nuclear schwinger - dyson formalism  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the results of these models indicate that the quark condensate in nuclear matter is considerably reduced already for saturation density .",
    "the effect of chiral symmetry restoration can also be connected to the effective baryon mass  @xcite . at the critical temperature @xmath4",
    ", the hadronic states may survive in the high temperature phase of qcd @xcite where the mesons are massless in the chiral limit . due to the brown - rho scaling @xcite , the baryon mass will also be zero at this time . in general ,",
    "deconfinement has been described in terms of polyakov loop .",
    "@xmath9 @xcite illustrated that the deconfinement is a consequence of chiral symmetry restoration in the presence of massless quarks in the fundamental representation .",
    "on the other hand , brown @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite show that chiral symmetry restoration is accompanied by the vanishing of the trace anomaly which is connected with the baryon mass .",
    "therefore , the baryon mass can be used as an order parameter for chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "presently , the complex action of qcd at finite chemical potential makes it difficult to study finite - density qcd properties directly from first principle lattice calculations .",
    "we therefore have to resort even more to phenomenological models to investigate hadronic matter .",
    "the symmetries of qcd can be used as a guideline to determine largely how the hadrons should interact with each other . following this idea , models based on su(2)@xmath10 su(2)@xmath11 symmetry and scale invariance",
    "were proposed .",
    "these effective models have been widely used in the last years to investigate nuclear matter and finite nuclei both at zero and at finite temperature  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "papazoglou et al .",
    "extended the effective chiral models to su(3)@xmath10su(3)@xmath11 including the full baryon octet  @xcite .",
    "although these chiral models indicate that the effective nucleon mass decreases with density , there is no phase transition with respect to chiral symmetry restoration . as an extension we proposed the chiral su(3 ) quark mean field model and investigated hadronic and quark matter  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry restoration of nuclear matter was also studied in this model and a phase transition was found  @xcite . at some critical baryon density , the effective nucleon mass and the quark condensate decrease discontinuously . in the present work",

    "phase iv , designates the case where both @xmath1 and @xmath2 have zero effective masses , whereas phase v only has a vanishing value for @xmath168 . for different value of the strangeness fraction @xmath3 , the normal phase i will turn into different chiral symmetry restoration phases at different critical densities . for nonstrange nuclear matter the critical baryon density is reached at a value of 0.28 @xmath171 , where the system will be in phase ii . for values of the strangeness fraction with @xmath173 , the critical density increases with growing @xmath174 .",

    "a further transition from phase iii into phase iv takes places . for @xmath179 , the normal phase i changes into phase iv at the critical point . for @xmath180 ,",
    "chiral symmetry restoration is manifest only in phase v.    the energy per baryon e / a is defined as @xmath181 in fig .",

    "the model is based on effective quark - meson and meson self - interactions which satisfy the chiral su(3 ) symmetry constraint .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration of nonstrange nuclear matter was studied in a previous paper  @xcite .",
    "when a critical baryon density is reached , the effective nucleon mass will drop to zero .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the fact that nuclear matter has its lowest energy per volume in the chiral symmetry restoration phase at high density .    in the present work we extended the discussion to strange hadronic systems including @xmath1 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 hyperons . as for the case of nonstrange nuclear matter , when the baryon density is sufficient high , the minimum of the energy per volume @xmath164 of strange matter will occur for effective baryon masses reaching a vanishing value .",
    "as it turns out , the effective masses of the different baryons do not change to zero at the same value of baryon density and strangeness fraction . in the effective model there occur four different chiral symmetry restoration phases which are characterized by zero effective masses of the different baryons . for a given strangeness fraction ,",
    "when the baryon density is larger than the critical density , hadronic matter will make a transition to the corresponding chiral symmetry restoration phase with values for the critical density which is about 2 - 3 times larger than the nuclear saturation density @xmath184 .",

    "the minimum of e / a in the normal phase is lower than the one of the restored phase . for large strangeness fraction",
    "the system is favored to be in the chiral symmetry restoration phase since it occurs with a larger binding energy .",
    "the maximal binding energy is about 70 mev for a strangeness fraction of about 1.5 .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition may also occur at high densities .",
    "it is worthwhile to study whether the phase transition between hadronic and quark matter also takes place at values for the baryon densities which are close to the ones when chiral symmetry restoration occurs .",
