    "krylov published in 1898 a method to compute the hydrodynamic loads for ship motions in waves , assuming that the presence of the ship did not perturb the waves , but the _ floating body problem _ was probably formulated by fritz john in two celebrated papers @xcite .",
    "it consists in studying the motion of the mechanical system formed by a fluid and a partially immersed solid @xmath2 .",
    "the fluid is delimited above by a free surface , and is assumed to be incompressible and in irrotational motion , while the solid @xmath2 can have a prescribed motion or can be freely floating . in the latter case ,",
    "the motion of the solid is governed by newton s laws in which the gravity force ( and possibly other external forces ) is complemented by the force and torque exerted by the liquid on the solid .",
    "this is a complex problem in which two free boundary problems are involved .",
    "the first one is the standard water waves problem consisting in describing the evolution of the surface of the fluid when it is in contact with the air .",
    "the second free boundary problem comes from the fact that the _ wetted surface _ @xmath3 , i.e. the portion of the boundary of the solid in contact with the fluid , depends on time . for these reasons ,",
    "fritz john considered a much simplified problem . expressing the velocity @xmath4 in the fluid domain @xmath5 in terms of a velocity potential @xmath6 , @xmath7 he made the following assumptions    * a linear model for the evolution of the free surface waves is considered in the _ exterior domain _ ( i.e. where the surface of the fluid is not in contact with the solid ) , namely @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravity and @xmath10 the parametrization of the free surface above the rest state @xmath11 .",
    "* the motion of the solid is assumed to be of small amplitude . *",
    "the variations of the wetted surface @xmath3 with time are neglected .    on the _ interior domain _",
    "( i.e. under the structure ) , the continuity of the normal velocity across @xmath12 , yields the additional condition @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity of the solid on the wetted surface and @xmath15 the upward unit normal vector ; when the solid is in forced motion , this is a known function of time , and when the solid is freely floating it must be deduced from the newton s laws that govern the motion of the solid . in the latter case , it is necessary to know the pressure exerted by the fluid on the bottom of the boat ( called the _ interior pressure _ @xmath16 ) ; this is done in @xcite using the linearized bernoulli equation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the atmospheric pressure , and @xmath19 the parametrization of the bottom of the solid .",
    "+ finally , some transition conditions are needed at the _ contact line _ that separates the interior and exterior domains . in @xcite ,",
    "these conditions are not stated clearly and not completely correct ; as we shall see , this is mainly because the velocity potential @xmath6 is not the appropriate quantity to express such transition conditions . in @xcite",
    ", it is further assumed that the motion in time is harmonic at some given frequency , so that the full problem reduces to a spectral problem , in which the main difficulty becomes the analysis and/or numerical computation of the associated green functions .",
    "fritz john s approach of the floating body problem , though oversimplified in many aspects ( it misses in particular the nonlinear effects , the evolution of the wetted surface , etc . ) , is still used and studied a lot , both theoretically and numerically .",
    "it has been slightly generalized to include second order effects @xcite ( though still neglecting the time variations of the wetted surface ) and is still the principal method used in the extensive literature devoted to floating structures such as wave power devices for instance @xcite ; it is also the basis of softwares like wamit , widely used to compute the motion of offshore structures in waves .",
    "more recently , the nonlinear effects in the floating body problem have been taken into account in various numerical studies , mostly based on boundary element methods for the resolution of the potential equation ( see for instance the review @xcite ) .",
    "the nonlinear aspect of the underlying hydrodynamics is taken into account by a nonlinear boundary element method ( see @xcite for instance ) , and the hydrodynamic forces on the wetted surface can be computed at each time ( see for instance @xcite ) , which allows the description of the evolution of the contact line .",
    "these methods require the resolution of boundary integral equations and have a big computational cost .",
    "this is also the case of the cfd approach based on the numerical resolution of the full navier - stokes equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these methods have in common that they require the resolution of a @xmath20-dimensional elliptic problem in the fluid domain ( @xmath0 is the horizontal dimension ) , or a boundary integral equation , in order to compute the interior pressure @xmath16 through bernoulli s equation as explained above ; moreover , the presence of the time derivative of the velocity potential in this expression yields considerable stability issues in the numerical simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a different approach than the one initiated by f. john and in particular , we no longer seek to recover the interior pressure @xmath16 through bernoulli s equation .",
    "more precisely , we propose a new formulation of the full ( nonlinear ) floating body problem in which    * the transition conditions at the contact line can be expressed in a simple way and the evolution law for the contact line can be derived . *",
    "the problem is stated as a @xmath0-dimensional compressible - incompressible model in which the interior pressure @xmath16 is found as the lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint that the surface of the fluid coincides with the boundary of the solid under the floating body ( i.e. @xmath21 ) .",
    "the interest of this formulation , itself based on a new formulation of the standard water waves equations in terms of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the horizontal discharge , is that the dimensionality of the elliptic equation one has to solve to find @xmath16 is reduced : it is now a simple @xmath0-dimensional elliptic equation ( as opposed to the @xmath24 elliptic equation on the potential one has to solve in the approach described above ) .",
    "replacing @xmath16 by the solution of this elliptic equation , one can moreover eliminate the constraint @xmath21 in the interior region , exactly in the same way as the incompressible euler equations can be transformed into an unconstrained quasilinear evolution equation on the velocity .",
    "note also that the compressible - incompressible structure mentioned above is typical of congested flows that appear in several contexts such as two - phase flows @xcite , traffic jams @xcite , formation of crowds @xcite , granular flows @xcite , compressible - low mach coupling in gaz dynamics @xcite , etc .",
    "we also want in this paper to take advantage , with this new formulation of the floating body problem , of the progresses that have been made in recent years in the mathematical study of the motion of a rigid body @xmath2 totally immersed in an incompressible perfect fluid confined to a domain @xmath5 .",
    "this is also a problem that has attracted a lot of attention , starting with the works of dalembert , kelvin and kirchoff .",
    "the equations governing the motion are provided by the euler equations for the dynamics of the fluid in the region @xmath25 outside the solid , often ( but not necessarily ) complemented with an irrotationality assumption .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to this problem has been proved in @xcite ; in @xcite the authors used the added mass effect to prove that the regularity of the motion of the solid is limited only by the regularity of the boundary of the solid . roughly speaking ,",
    "the added mass effect consists in the fact that some components of the hydrodynamics force and torque applied on the solid act as if the mass - inertia matrix in newton s law were modified by the addition of a positive matrix .",
    "this is because a rigid body has to accelerate not only itself but also the fluid around it . exploiting this effect is necessary for a sharp mathematical analysis of the equations @xcite and plays also a crucial role for the stability of numerical simulations in many fluid - structure interaction problems @xcite .",
    "this added - mass effect can be quite complex however , since it depends strongly on the location of the solid with respect to the boundaries of the fluid domain @xcite ; in the case a floating body considered here , the analysis is complicated by the fact that the boundary of the fluid domain is a free surface , which moreover intersects the surface of the body .",
    "the second goal of the paper is therefore to    * exhibit the added - mass effect in our compressible - incompressible formulation of the floating body problem * take advantage of the simplicity of the elliptic equation on the interior pressure @xmath16 to get a simple expression of the mass - inertia matrix ( which becomes explicit in @xmath26 dimension ) .",
    "of course , the resulting formulation of the floating body problem remains quite complex . from the mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "proving a local well - posedness result is a very challenging issue since , not speaking of the coupling with the solid motion , it requires several results on the water waves equations that are important open problems . for instance",
    ", the regularity of the surface on the whole domain is not expected to be better than lipschitz because there is an angle / wedge at the contact line , for some @xmath27 explicit @xcite .",
    "] , there is no result on the mixed initial - boundary value problem for the water waves equations , etc .",
    "the numerical simulation of the full water waves equations is also quite demanding .",
    "for these reasons , and with the goal of being able to study numerically real wave - structure interactions , and in particular nonlinear effects ( efforts on offshore platforms in extreme events , wave energy converters , etc . ) , one is led to derive simplified asymptotic models .",
    "we shall consider here the case of shallow water configurations for which the asymptotics of the water - waves equations ( without floating body ) is now well understood @xcite .",
    "there are however only a few references that extend the resulting asymptotic models in the presence of a floating body . in @xcite",
    "the authors used a boussinesq model to describe the flow under the free surface , while solving the potential equation for @xmath6 under the floating body ( from which the interior pressure @xmath16 is recovered along the lines described above ) .",
    "closer to our approach , @xcite and @xcite propose a system of two boussinesq systems ( one under the structure , and the other one under the free surface ) , and the interior pressure is numerically solved so that these two sets of equations are compatible ; the formulation used in these references does not however allow to write a simple explicit elliptic equation on the interior pressure as in the approach we propose here .",
    "the third goal of this paper is therefore    * to use the strategy explained above ( in the case of the full water waves equations ) in order to allow for the presence of a floating structure in various shallow water models  we consider here the nonlinear shallow water equations and a boussinesq system .",
    "more precisely , we show that in the presence of a floating body , these models can be written under the form of a compressible - incompressible system . to",
    "every model corresponds a particular lagrange multiplier and therefore a particular interior pressure @xmath16 .",
    "* to generalize this approach to numerical schemes ; we show in particular how to find a discretization of the interior pressure in such a way that it plays the role of a discrete lagrange multiplier . *",
    "show the efficiency of this method with some numerical computations for the one dimensional nonlinear shallow water and boussinesq models .    in these numerical computations ,",
    "the fact that the interior pressure is the discrete lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint that the surface of the fluid under the floating structure coincides with the boundary of this latter allows us to solve the equations in the full computational domain ( without having to handle the coupling between the interior and exterior regions ) ; the surface elevation computed in this way coincides at machine precision with the bottom of the solid in the wetted region . under the assumptions described above",
    ", the floating body problem can therefore be solved numerically very efficiently .",
    "we first describe in section [ sectwwfloat ] how the waves are affected by the presence of a floating structure , without considering the motion of the solid itself .",
    "the formulation of the equations is first given in ",
    "[ sectfsef ] ; it follows from this formulation that the horizontal discharge ( or the vertically averaged vertical velocity @xmath28 ) is a natural quantity to express the transition conditions at the contact line .",
    "we therefore seek in  [ sectfsezv ] a formulation of the water waves equations in terms of this variable ( and of the surface elevation ) . after proving that such a formulation exists and is closed ( i.e. that all the physical quantities involved can be reconstructed in terms of the horizontal discharge and of the surface elevation )",
    ", we generalize this formulation in  [ sectfsezvfloat ] in the presence of a floating structure .",
    "this formulation has a compressible - incompressible structure : it is compressible in the exterior region , and incompressible under the floating structure .",
    "the interior pressure @xmath16 naturally appears as the lagrange multiplier associated to the `` incompressibility '' condition @xmath21 , and it can be found by solving a simple @xmath0-dimensional elliptic equation .",
    "+ in section [ sectsolid ] , the motion of the floating structure is considered .",
    "we first consider in  [ sectpresc ] the case of a solid with a forced motion , while the case of a freely floating solid is studied in  [ sectfloat ] . in the latter case",
    ", the motion of the solid is found through newton s laws where the force corresponding to the interior pressure @xmath16 is the buoyancy force ; this force is decomposed into several components , one of which corresponding to an added mass effect .",
    "let us mention that in both cases ( forced motion and freely floating body ) , specific attention is paid to the one - dimensional case : the elliptic equation for the interior pressure @xmath16 is then one - dimensional and can be solved explicitly .",
    "+ the evolution of the contact line is then studied in section [ sectcontact ] , in the one dimensional case in  [ sectcontact1d ] , and in the two - dimensional case in  [ sectcontact2d ] .",
    "we also explain in  [ sectvertical ] the modifications one has to carry out when the boundaries of the floating structure are vertical at the contact line .",
    "+ in section [ sectasfloat ] , we replace the water waves equations for the free surface by simpler asymptotic models .",
    "the case of the nonlinear shallow water equations is considered in  [ sectsw ] , while the boussinesq equations are treated in  [ sectbouss ] .",
    "+ we then show in section [ sectdiscrete ] how to implement our approach at the level of the numerical scheme . to this end",
    ", we consider a simple one dimensional configuration in which the solid is only allowed to move vertically and has vertical lateral walls ( the contact points are then independent of time ) .",
    "we show how to discretize the interior pressure in such a way that it plays the role of a discrete lagrange multiplier for the numerical scheme .",
    "the equations are presented in  [ sect_modsw ] when the hydrodynamic model is the nonlinear shallow water equations .",
    "particular attention is paid to the ordinary differential equation resulting from newton s law .",
    "we are in particular able to find a simple nonlinear second order ode governing the motion of the solid in the return to equilibrium problem ( the solid is dropped from an out of equilibrium position in a fluid initially at rest ) .",
    "the numerical scheme is then presented and studied in",
    " [ sectnumsw ] , and this approach is extended in  [ sect_modbouss ] when the underlying hydrodynamic model is the boussinesq system . +",
    "the numerical computations based on these schemes are then presented in section [ sectcomput ] . for the nonlinear shallow water equations ,",
    "several configurations are considered in  [ sectnumsimsw ] : a fixed solid , a solid in prescribed motion , and a freely floating solid . in the last two cases we can derive formulas for explicit solutions for some configurations and",
    "use them to validate our numerical simulations .",
    "numerical simulations when the hydrodynamical model is the boussinesq system are then presented in  [ sectnumbouss ] .",
    "finally , several results are postponed to appendices . in appendix [ appinteriorpressure ]",
    "we derive an alternative equation for the interior pressure , while the equations of motion for the solid structure are given in appendix [ appbodyframe ] in a body frame instead of the eulerian frame .",
    "we just introduce here some basic notations ; _ a full table of notations is provided at the end of the paper . _ + - we denote by @xmath29 the horizontal dimension .",
    "+ - the gradient operator with respect to the horizontal variables @xmath30 is denoted by @xmath31 ; the full @xmath20-dimensional gradient operator is denoted @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the vertical variable . + - if @xmath34 , we denote by @xmath35 its horizontal components , and by @xmath36 its vertical ( last ) component .",
    "+ - we denote by @xmath37 the unit upward vertical vector , and by @xmath38 and @xmath39 the unit vectors in the horizontal directions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "+ - when @xmath42 , we write @xmath43 and sometimes use the notation @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "+ - we denote with single vertical bars @xmath46 norms over the horizontal plane @xmath47 , and with a double bar @xmath48 norms over the fluid domain @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , @xmath49",
    "let us consider here the dynamics of the waves in the presence of a partially immersed device ( typically a ship or a floating wave energy converter ) . denoting by @xmath50 the volume occupied by the ( solid ) device at time @xmath51 , we write @xmath52 its boundary and @xmath53 the _ wetted surface _ , that is , the portion of @xmath52 in contact with the water , and by @xmath54 ( @xmath0 being the horizontal dimension ) its projection on the horizontal plane , which we shall refer to as the _ interior domain_. the _ exterior domain _",
    "@xmath55 is then naturally defined as @xmath56 we consider in this paper the case where overhanging waves do not occur and where the wetted surface can be parametrized by a graph of some function @xmath57 , for all @xmath58 .",
    "the surface of the water is therefore determined by the graph of a function @xmath59 satisfying the constraint @xmath60 on @xmath61 . denoting by @xmath62 the typical depth at rest and by @xmath63 a parametrization of the bottom , the domain @xmath64 occupied by the fluid at time @xmath51 is therefore given by @xmath65        [ notaintext ] for any function @xmath66 defined on @xmath67 , we denote with a subscript @xmath68 its restriction to the interior domain @xmath61 and with a subscript @xmath69 its restriction to the exterior domain @xmath55",
    ", @xmath70    we assume that the flow is incompressible , irrotational , of constant density @xmath71 , and inviscid .",
    "we can then formulate the equations as a set of equations in @xmath64 , complemented with boundary conditions and a constraint associated to the presence of the immersed structure :    * _ equations in the fluid domain @xmath64_. denoting by @xmath72 and @xmath73 the velocity and pressure fields , the equations are given by @xmath74 where @xmath9 is the acceleration of gravity and @xmath71 the constant density of the water .",
    "* _ boundary conditions at the surface_. the surface being bounding ( i.e. no fluid particle crosses it ) , one gets the traditional kinematic equation @xmath75 where we denoted @xmath76 the trace of the the velocity field @xmath4 at the free surface .",
    "+ the assumption that the pressure is given by the constant atmospheric pressure @xmath18 on the exterior domain ( i.e. on the portion of the surface of the fluid that is not in contact with the immersed structure ) , gives if we write @xmath77 and with notation [ notaintext ] , @xmath78 * _ boundary condition at the bottom_. assuming that the bottom is impermeable , we get another boundary condition at the bottom @xmath79 where we denoted by @xmath80 the trace of @xmath4 at the bottom . * _ constraint in the interior domain_. by definition , the surface of the fluid coincides with the bottom of the solid structure in the interior domain ; according to notation [ notaintext ] , this yields @xmath81    it is important to insist on the fact that the _ interior pressure _ @xmath82 is not known and must be determined from the above equations .",
    "similarly , the interior and exterior domains @xmath61 and @xmath55 are also unknowns of the problem that we must determine . to this end",
    ", we need another set of boundary , or _ transition _ , conditions at the contact line ( defined as the part of the bottom of the boat which is in contact both with air and water ) .",
    "let us first give some notations .",
    "we denote by @xmath83 the projection of the contact line on the horizontal plane    it is implicitly assumed that @xmath84 , @xmath82 , etc .",
    "@xmath85 , @xmath86 , etc . )",
    "are smooth in @xmath61 ( resp .",
    "@xmath87 ) and that they can be extended by continuity on the closure of these domains ; however , they are certainly not smooth on the whole horizontal plane @xmath67 .",
    "we only have the following boundary conditions at the contact line :    * _ continuity of the surface elevation_. there is no jump of the surface elevation at the contact line , @xmath88 * _ continuity of the pressure at the contact line_. we assume that @xmath89    the equations - together with the constraint and the boundary conditions at the contact line - form the _ free surface euler equation in the presence of a floating body @xmath2 _ , that we can also see as _ constrained free surface euler equations_.    the transition conditions - obviously exclude the configuration where the boundaries of the solid are vertical at the contact line .",
    "we show in  [ sectvertical ] how to handle such configurations and generalize - .    of course , further information is needed on the motion of the solid : it can be fixed , in prescribed motion , or freely floating for instance .",
    "these situations will be addressed in section [ sectsolid ] .",
    "taking @xmath90 and @xmath91 , equations - are the classical ( i.e. without any floating structure ) free surface euler equations , also called water - waves equations .",
    "these equations are cast on the @xmath20- dimensional domain @xmath64 which is itself unknown .",
    "+ several reformulations of these equations have been proposed in order to work with a set of equations on a fixed domain . among these reformulations ,",
    "one of the most popular is the zakharov - craig - sulem formulation @xcite , which is a set of two scalar equations on @xmath10 and on @xmath92 , the trace of the velocity potential at the surface .",
    "the dimension reduction of this formulation is one of its main features : @xmath10 and @xmath92 depend only on the horizontal space variables , so that the @xmath33 dependency has been removed .",
    "working with @xmath10 and @xmath92 is therefore quite usual when analyzing the water waves problem , but the asymptotic models that are used for applications in oceanography are generally not cast in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath92 . for these models , a dimension reduction is also done to eliminate the vertical variable @xmath33 , but this reduction is performed using a different procedure , namely , _ vertical integration_. consequently , the asymptotic models ( such as the nonlinear shallow water equations , the serre - green - naghdi equations , etc . ) are cast in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath23 , where @xmath23 is the horizontal discharge defined as follows .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the horizontal discharge defined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the horizontal component of the velocity field @xmath4 .",
    "such a formulation in @xmath22 variables is also much more adapted than the classical @xmath95 formulation to handle the transition conditions at the contact line .",
    "the aim of this section is therefore to derive a new formulation of the full water waves equations in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath23 .",
    "integrating along the vertical variable @xmath33 the momentum equation , it is well known @xcite that , in absence of any immersed solid , one can derive a set of equations coupling the water depth @xmath96 to the vertically integrated horizontal component of the velocity @xmath23 and given by @xmath97 where the non hydrostatic pressure @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 in - however , several quantities are not explicit functions of @xmath10 and @xmath23 ; it is therefore necessary to prove that the full velocity field @xmath4 in @xmath64 can be recovered from the knowledge of @xmath10 and @xmath23 . in the next section ,",
    "the technical tools for such a reconstruction are provided .",

    "<S> this paper addresses the floating body problem which consists in studying the interaction of surface water waves with a floating body . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new formulation of the water waves problem that can easily be generalized in order to take into account the presence of a floating body . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equations have a compressible - incompressible structure in which the interior pressure exerted by the fluid on the floating body is a lagrange multiplier that can be determined through the resolution of a @xmath0-dimensional elliptic equation , where @xmath0 is the horizontal dimension . </S>",
    "<S> in the case where the object is freely floating , we decompose the hydrodynamic force and torque exerted by the fluid on the solid in order to exhibit an added mass effect ; in the one dimensional case @xmath1 , the computations can be carried out explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> + we also show that this approach in which the interior pressure appears as a lagrange multiplier can be implemented on reduced asymptotic models such as the nonlinear shallow water equations and the boussinesq equations ; we also show that it can be transposed to the discrete version of these reduced models and propose simple numerical schemes in the one dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> we finally present several numerical computations based on these numerical schemes ; in order to validate these computations we exhibit explicit solutions in some particular configurations such as the return to equilibrium problem in which an object is dropped from a non - equilibrium position in a fluid which is initially at rest . </S>"
