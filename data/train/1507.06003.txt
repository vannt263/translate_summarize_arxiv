    "when a solution of a system of ordinary differential equations approaches a stable periodic orbit , rather than its location in phase space at a given time , a more useful quantity is often the asymptotic ( or eventual ) phase of the orbit .",
    "the asymptotic phase distinguishes the long - term behaviour of different orbits , and sets of points with the same asymptotic phase are called _",
    "isochrons_. if different isochrons intersect they create a _ phaseless point _",
    ", where the asymptotic phase is undefined . near a phaseless point",
    "the asymptotic phase is highly sensitive to perturbations . in smooth systems ,",
    "phaseless points are often unstable equilibria which can only be approached asymptotically ( in backward time ) . in piecewise - smooth systems there",
    "exist phaseless points that can be intersected in finite time , without any slowing of the dynamics suffered near an equilibrium .",
    "the two - fold singularity , an enigma of piecewise - smooth dynamical systems theory , is one such phaseless point .",
    "there are many reasons why it might be desirable to alter the phase of an existing oscillatory motion .",
    "one approach to tackling parkinson s disease , for instance , is to disturb the synchronised neural activity associated with physical tremors @xcite .",
    "desynchronisation can be achieved with pulses @xcite , pulse trains @xcite , a control that utilises time - delay @xcite , or some other well - chosen feedback law @xcite .",
    "phase randomisation for prototypical neuron models is achieved in @xcite by briefly applying a control that transports the orbit to the close proximity of a phaseless point .",
    "the orbit subsequently returns to periodic motion but now has a different asymptotic phase .",
    "this phase is highly sensitive to the precise point at which the orbit is located when the control is removed , so small stochasticity in the system causes the resulting asymptotic phases of different neurons to be highly randomised .    in piecewise smooth dynamical systems ,",
    "two - fold singularities were first described by filippov @xcite , and have garnered interest as points where both the forward and backward time uniqueness of a flow can break down , in an otherwise deterministic flow @xcite . for a vector field that is discontinuous on some hypersurface  the _ discontinuity surface _  a two - fold is a point where the flow has quadratic tangencies ( ` folds ' ) to both sides of the surface simultaneously .",
    "two - folds occur generically at isolated points in three - dimensional piecewise - smooth vector fields , and on @xmath0-dimensional manifolds in @xmath1-dimensional vector fields @xcite .",
    "they have been identified in models of circuit systems @xcite and mechanical systems @xcite , and have deep connections to folded nodes of slow - fast systems @xcite .",
    "the dynamics local to a two - fold depends on whether the vector field on either side is curving toward or away from the discontinuity surface , and on the alignments of the two vector fields relative to each other @xcite .",
    "here we illustrate the practical implications of a two - fold for phase randomisation .",
    "as well as suggesting how two - folds might affect real systems , this suggests a use for them as control devices for the desynchronisation of oscillators . to this end",
    "we shall consider systems where a two - fold occurs either naturally in a piecewise - smooth system , or is introduced to a smooth system via a discontinuous control .",
    "we will simulate orbits in the presence of small noise as they pass close to a two - fold , and focus on how their phases are randomised by the nearby presence of the singularity .",
    "the two - fold is not a zero of the vector field , so there is no slowing of the flow during phase randomisation achieved in this way .",

    "<S> a two - fold is a singular point on the discontinuity surface of a piecewise - smooth vector field , at which the vector field is tangent to the discontinuity surface on both sides . if an orbit passes through an invisible two - fold ( also known as a teixeira singularity ) before settling to regular periodic motion , then the phase of that motion can not be determined from initial conditions , and in the presence of small noise the asymptotic phase of a large number of sample solutions is highly random . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show how the probability distribution of the asymptotic phase depends on the global nonlinear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how the phase of a smooth oscillator can be randomised by applying a simple discontinuous control law that generates an invisible two - fold . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that such a control law can be used to desynchronise a collection of oscillators , and that this manner of phase randomisation is fast compared to existing methods ( which use fixed points as phase singularities ) because there is no slowing of the dynamics near a two - fold .    </S>",
