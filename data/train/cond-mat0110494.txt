    "the experimental achievement of atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite has stimulated extensive theoretical and experimental studies in this area .",
    "one of the most impressive examples of applications of bec is to use condensates with internal degrees of freedom to generate quantum entanglement @xcite , which is the essential ingredient for many quantum information protocols @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the coherent collisional interactions in becs allow to generate substantial many - particle entanglement in the spin degrees of freedom of a two - component condensate @xcite during the free evolution of the condensates .",
    "the whole time evolution of the internal degrees of freedom is determined by the interaction strengths between the condensed particles .",
    "thus it is desirable to control these interaction strengths by some external means since this opens the possibility to engineer many particle entangled states .",
    "one possibility is to change the atomic interaction potential directly by applying an external magnetic field which changes the scattering length . if one uses feshbach resonances @xcite this method allows for considerable changes in the interaction properties of becs . in this paper",
    "we will propose another method to externally control the interaction strengths using @xmath0 pulses .",
    "this will not directly change the interatomic interaction potential but rather implement an _ effective _ hamiltonian with an interaction strength depending on external parameters which can be adjusted easily .",
    "we will use this effective hamiltonian to study the influence of changing the interaction strengths on the external wave function .",
    "furthermore , we will be able to control the time evolution of the internal degrees of freedom which are solely determined by the effective interaction strengths .",
    "in particular we will show how to turn off the hamiltonian for the internal states , i.e. , the internal states will evolve like those in an ideal gas .",
    "let us briefly explain the basic idea for changing the interaction strengths of becs using @xmath0 pulses : if we fix the spatial mode function of a two component condensate the dynamics of these two components is described by the hamiltoinian @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-component of an angular momentum operator @xmath4 given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are bosonic destruction operators for particles in internal state @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) with a spatial mode function @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is determined by the interaction properties of the two - component condensate .",
    "we apply @xmath0 raman - laser or microwave pulses to the condensate which rotate the spin around the @xmath12 or @xmath13 axis by an angle @xmath0 depending on the phase of the pulse as we will show in sec .",
    "[ twomodeapprox ] .",
    "the idea is to use a sequence of @xmath0 pulses which rotates @xmath14 to create contributions to the hamiltonian given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 for a time @xmath17 while the system evolves with @xmath18 for a time @xmath19 .",
    "time averaging leads to an effective hamiltonian which can be written as @xmath20 the operator @xmath21 is a constant of motion and the hamiltonian therefore is equivalent to @xmath22 up to a ( time dependent ) global phase .",
    "thus , the application of the @xmath0 pulses effectively leads to a change in the interaction parameters from @xmath11 to @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 we find the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 to vanish .",
    "the internal states then evolve like those in a non - interacting gas .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ modelsec ] we will introduce the model . after writing down the hamiltonian of a two component condensate interacting with a classical laser or microwave field we will define a specific series of pulses applied to the condensate .",
    "then we will calculate the time averaged hamiltonian and determine the dependence of the effective interaction strengths on parameters of the external field . in sec .",
    "[ applsec ] we will study possible applications of this effective hamiltonian .",
    "we will investigate the influence of changing the interaction strength on the spatial wave functions of the condensate as well as on the evolution of the internal atomic degrees of freedom .",

    "the classical field can be realized by either a raman - laser or by a microwave field applied to the condensate .",
    "we assume @xmath32 to be @xmath33 independent , i.e.  there is negligible momentum transfer to the condensates due to the interaction with the classical field .",

    "next we investigate the time evolution of the system while the external field is turned on .",
