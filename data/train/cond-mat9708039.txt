    "it is well known that the spin-@xmath5 impurity interacting antiferromagnetically with a fermi liquid is completely screened at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "this screening is the essence of the kondo effect@xcite .",
    "the question of the screening length is much more subtle .",
    "scaling implies , at least dimensionally , that the low energy scale of the model , the kondo temperature @xmath6 , should be associated with an exponentially large length scale , @xmath7 ( here @xmath8 is the kondo coupling times density of states and @xmath9 is the band width ) . according to nozires fermi liquid picture @xcite",
    ", one could imagine an electron in a region of this size which forms a singlet with the impurity spin .",
    "note that this is a more dynamical type of screening than that which occurs for charge impurities in a fermi liquid since it involves a linear combination of states where the impurity spin and the screening electron spin are in either an up - down or down - up configuration .",
    "in particular , the finiteness of the susceptibility at @xmath10 should not be attributed to a static conduction electron polarization cancelling the impurity spin polarization .",
    "rather it results from the tendency of the impurity to form a singlet with the screening electron .",
    "whether or not this large screening cloud really exists has been a controversial subject in the literature , and has recently attracted some theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "boyce and slichter @xcite had performed direct knight shift measurements of the spin - spin correlator at all temperatures and had concluded that there was no evidence of the so - called screening cloud .",
    "their measurements , however , were limited to very low distances ( not more than several lattice spacings ) , and therefore could not probe directly any possible crossover at the distance scale @xmath11 .    to study the screening cloud , we will consider the behavior of spatial spin - spin correlation functions , both zero frequency and equal time .",
    "there are two distance scales in the kondo problem at finite temperature , @xmath11 and the thermal scale @xmath12 . on general scaling grounds ,",
    "the spatial correlators should depend on the ratio of the distance @xmath13 to these two scales .",
    "srensen and one of us @xcite have suggested a scaling form for the @xmath13-dependent knight shift , proportional to the zero frequency spin susceptibility , which has been justified numerically and perturbatively@xcite : @xmath14 here we have subtracted the pauli contribution @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the density of states per spin .",
    "the g - factor for the magnetic impurities is not necessarily equal to that of the conduction electrons .",
    "this is especially the case for some rare earth ions , which have complex multiplet structure .",
    "if we take into account this possibility , scaling properties of the local spin susceptibility become not so simple , and we will consider them below . the knight shift in this case is a sum of two parts , which scale differently@xcite .",
    "a possible objection to the naive concept of the screening cloud is based on sum rule arguments .",
    "the integral of the local spin susceptibility eq.([sf ] ) is proportional to the zero - frequency correlator @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the spin of the conduction electrons , @xmath19 .",
    "it can be shown that there is no net polarization of the conduction electrons@xcite , and this correlator should vanish in the scaling limit ( @xmath20 with @xmath2 held fixed ) . at @xmath21",
    "this is simply a consequence of the ground state being a singlet . as remarked above , this",
    "does not necessarily imply the absence of the screening cloud in the sense of nozires but only that the screening is a dynamical process .    in order to see the dynamical cloud of conduction electrons",
    "let us consider a snapshot of the system , the equal - time correlators .",
    "take @xmath22 as an example .",
    "note that @xmath23 for a spin-@xmath5 impurity , while @xmath24 as mentioned above .",
    "( note that for this conserved quantity the equal - time and zero frequency green s functions are proportional to each other . )",
    "thus the correlator @xmath25 ; that is @xmath26 obeys a sum rule .",
    "@xmath27 is a possible definition of the screening cloud profile .",
    "the ground state properties of spatial correlators are determined by the kondo scale only .",
    "in general we expect three different scaling regimes for @xmath28 at a given temperature , with the @xmath13-boundaries defined by the thermal and kondo length scales .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine scaling behavior of the spin correlators in these regimes .",
    "exponentially large length scale @xmath11 , if present , could have important consequences for the theory of alloys with magnetic impurities .",
    "indeed , typical @xmath29 and @xmath30 makes @xmath31 , where a is the lattice spacing . recently",
    "this issue was addressed in 1d for luttinger liquids with magnetic impurities@xcite , where it was found that a crossover happened for @xmath32 .",
    "although perturbative calculations had been done early on@xcite , no definite predictions were made regarding the size of the kondo screening cloud .",
    "et al._@xcite have developed renormalization group approach .",
    "they , however , only considered short - range correlations @xmath33 .",
    "we use the rg - improved perturbative technique , which can not access lowest temperatures @xmath34 . in order to gain some insight into what happens at low temperatures",
    ", we also consider overscreened @xmath35 multi - channel kondo effect , where the low - temperature fixed point is accessible perturbatively using @xmath36 expansion , k being the multiplicity of the bands .",
    "a very thorough @xmath36 analysis of the multi - channel kondo effect has been performed earlier by gan @xcite , who , however , came to conclusions opposite from ours .",
    "we also use the recent conformal field theory approach of one of us and ludwig @xcite to calculate the properties of the low - temperature , long distance correlation functions and the crossover at @xmath37 .",
    "this approach , is valid for all k but only for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and fails to predict the behavior of the spin correlators inside the screening cloud @xmath40 .",
    "the result is nevertheless interesting because , as one could expect , the spin - spin correlators reflect the non - fermi - liquid nature of the overscreened multi - channel fixed point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and remind the reader how it is transformed to an equivalent 1d model .",
    "we also define notations which we plan to use in the rest of the paper and derive the scaling equations for the spin susceptibility .",
    "section iii provides detailed perturbative analysis of the spin - spin correlation functions in the ordinary kondo model ( the fermi liquid fixed point ) .",
    "section iv is devoted to the non - fermi - liquid overscreened large - k case , where it is possible to obtain results for the spin correlators at all temperatures and distances using the @xmath36 expansion .",
    "we discuss our main conclusions in section v. in appendix a we mention a few details of our perturbative calculations .",
    "appendix b gives the proof of the vanishing of the uniform part of the susceptibility .",
    "appendix c gives results on the overscreened case ( @xmath41 ) at @xmath39 and @xmath38 obtained from conformal field theory .",
    "some of these results were presented briefly in ref .",
    "in what follows we consider the standard @xmath42 kondo model , @xmath43 and the multi - channel @xmath42 kondo model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath42 k - channel kondo model also includes summation over different channels @xmath44 : @xmath45 summation over repeated raised and lowered indiced is implied .",
    "the crucial difference between these two models can be seen from the form of the @xmath46-function @xcite : @xmath47 the flow of the effective coupling is different ( fig . [ flow ] ) for @xmath48 and @xmath41 . the low temperature fixed point of the multi - channel kondo problem is shown to have non - fermi - liquid nature @xcite . at large band multiplicity",
    "this nontrivial fixed point becomes accessible perturbatively .",
    "this difference is not important for the purpose of this section , and we use eq.([lkkm ] ) and eq.([bita ] ) for both multi - channel and @xmath48 models .",
    "the model is simplified if we assume spherically symmetric fermi - surface . indeed ,",
    "linearizing the spectrum and observing that scattering only takes place in the s - wave channel , we can expand the wave functions in spherical harmonics : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the linearized spectrum near the fermi surface , ( ... ) are higher harmonics . here",
    "@xmath51 is the dimensionless coupling constant of the kondo model , and @xmath52 is the density of states per spin .    the s - wave operators obey standard one - dimensional anti - commutation relations , @xmath53 we define left and right movers on a band of width @xmath54 around @xmath55 : @xmath56 the 3d fermion operators are then written in the form : @xmath57 + ( ... ) , \\label{3d1d}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 are higher harmonics .",
    "the left and right - moving fields defined on @xmath59 obey the boundary condition : @xmath60 flipping the right - moving field to the negative axis , @xmath61 , we rewrite the 1d hamiltonian in terms of the left - moving field only : @xmath62 the purpose of this paper is to analyse various spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "the most important of them is the distance - dependent knight shift , which can be measured in nmr experiments . if the impurity spin has a different gyromagnetic ratio from that of the conduction electrons , the uniform magnetic field couples to the spin operator @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the total spin operator of the impurity and conduction electrons , defined with channel sum for the multi - channel problem .",
    "the expression for the knight shift then consists of the electron and impurity contributions : @xmath66 ( we set @xmath67 . ) we will also consider the equal - time spin correlator @xmath68 , defined by : @xmath69 the above 1d formalism allows to simplify this expression for large @xmath70 . substituting eq.([3d1d ] ) in eq.([ksh ] ) , we get : @xmath71 where @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "for @xmath75 we get a similar expression : @xmath76 the total electron spin in 1d is : @xmath77 the uniform and @xmath3 parts take the form : @xmath78s^z_{\\rm a}(0 ) >   \\\\",

    "the knight shift is then given by eq.([kchi ] ) , with @xmath86 .",
    "since the kondo interaction is local , only boundary ( @xmath87 ) operators have non - zero anomalous dimensions .",
    "thus the conduction electron spin operator @xmath88 also has zero anomalous dimension , for @xmath89 .",

    "srensen and one of us have recently made a conjection @xcite , supported by perturbative and numerical results , that in the scaling limit , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the spin susceptibility has the following form : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a universal functions of two scaling variables@xcite .",
    "this form follows directly from eqs.([kchi],[rg0 ] ) . in general",
    ", one expects that there could be a non - zero phase in eq.([scaling ] ) , and a uniform term .",
    "it is easy to see that the phase is zero due to particle - hole symmetry@xcite .",
    "indeed , under particle - hole transformation @xmath96 , so @xmath97 , @xmath98 . particle - hole symmetry of eq.([scaling ] ) then requires that the phase is zero .",
    "this is not so for more realistic hamiltonians , for which the particle - hole symmetry is broken . for such hamiltonians",
    "there is an additional phase @xmath99 in eq.([scaling ] ) , but this phase does not renormalize .",
    "that is , it is essentially constant in the scaling region ( @xmath100 ) . the fact that the uniform part of the spin susceptibility is zero is less trivial .",
    "for the local spin susceptiblity we have proved@xcite that all graphs in perturbation theory contain certain integrals that vanish .",

    "the uniform part and the phase are zero for the knight shift in case of nontrivial gyromagnetic ratio for the impurity spin ( @xmath101 ) as well .    since we consider the problem perturbatively , it is useful to express the scaling function eq([scaling ] ) in terms of some effective coupling constants at an energy scale @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
