    "the analysis of energy spectra of different physical bounded systems has always been an interesting subject in quantum mechanics .",
    "the energy level spacings as well as the existence of degeneracies ( crossings ) in such systems have been widely studied during recent years .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom , the separability of the problem and the number of free parameters involved , among others , are very important features which have to be taken into account when a given quantum spectrum is analyzed .",
    "starting from percival s ideas @xcite for systems with more than one degree of freedom , two kinds of spectra have been distinguished .",
    "the regular spectrum , whose level spacing is characterized by a poisson distribution @xcite , is associated with integrable problems ( the harmonic oscillator is an exception ) .",
    "the other one , the irregular spectrum closely characterized by spectral statistic of the gaussian ensembles , corresponds to non - integrable systems @xcite .",
    "this statistical behavior can be related to crossings and repulsions between levels with the same symmetry when the spectra are analyzed as a function of the parameters of the problem .",
    "in fact , integrable systems depending on one parameter exhibit many crossings while non - integrable systems show repulsions and double - hyperbola curves ( avoided crossings ) , rather than degeneracies .",
    "so , for one parameter dependent systems , the presence of crossings or avoided crossings are quantum fingerprints of the properties of the classical dynamics .",
    "when the system depends on two parameters , the surfaces of energy ( that define in such cases the eigenenergies ) will cross in continuum curves leading to diedric intersections when the system remains integrable or they will intersect at isolated points ( `` diabolical points '' ) if the systems is not integrable ( assuming that it has time reversal symmetry)@xcite .",
    "distributions of avoided crossings ( for one parameter dependent systems ) according to properties such that the closest approach or the mean and difference between the slopes of the involved levels were already established for a generic quantum system employing parametric random - matrix models @xcite . the same models , extended to two and more parameters , were used to study distributions of diabolical points @xcite and other relevant distributions of singular points in the spectra @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that classical periodic orbits are essential elements to develop semiclassical quantization methods . not only for integrable systems ( through the berry - tabor formula @xcite ) but also for the non- integrable ones ( using the gutzwiller methods @xcite )",
    "the spectral density can be formally described in terms of closed orbits of the classical system .",
    "therefore , it would not be surprising that other quantum densities such as densities of degeneracies or densities of avoided crossings can be related to the periodic orbits .    in the present paper ,",
    "we find the density of degeneracies as an expansion in terms of the periodic orbits for classical integrable systems depending on one parameter .    in section [ densi ]",
    "we introduce the density of degeneracies .",
    "the semiclassical version can be written as a sum of a smooth part and oscillating contributions depending on the periodic orbits of the classical system .",
