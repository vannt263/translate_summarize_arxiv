    "clues to the evolution of galaxy clusters can be found in the detailed dynamics of the hot gas and galaxies they contain . in hierarchical models for large - scale structure formation ,",
    "clusters evolve by accreting small groups of galaxies and other clusters , a process that continues at the present epoch .",
    "x - ray signatures of a cluster merger include : an x - ray peak offset from the peak of the galaxy distribution ; an elongated x - ray core ; non - isothermal and asymmetric temperature distributions ; and the absence of a central cooling flow .",
    "these merger signs can be identified using @xmath0 pspc and @xmath1 data , which provide spatially resolved x - ray imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "clusters thought to have x - ray evidence of a recent ( or ongoing ) merger include abell  2256 ( briel et al .",
    "1991 ) , abell  754 ( henriksen & markevitch 1996 ; henry & briel 1995 ; zabludoff & zaritzky 1995 ) , and coma ( white , briel & henry 1993 ) .",
    "x - ray temperature maps for abell  2256 and abell  754 show complex temperature structure , most naturally explained if these clusters are undergoing a merger .",
    "abell  2255 is a rich cluster which shows several signs that it is undergoing a merger event .",
    "some of the first evidence for a merger came from early @xmath2 x - ray data : jones & forman ( 1984 ) found that abell  2255 has one of the largest x - ray core radii in their cluster sample .",
    "stewart et al . ( 1984 ) further analyzed @xmath2 ipc data and concluded that abell  2255 does not contain a cooling flow , which is unusual for a such a rich cluster ( edge , stewart & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "it is thought that a major merger would disrupt a pre - existing cooling flow and increase the core radius ( roettiger , burns & loken 1993 ) .",
    "more recently , burns et al . ( 1995 ) found from _",
    "rosat all sky survey _",
    "( @xmath3 ) data that the x - ray peak of abell  2255 is not centered on the brightest cluster galaxies but is offset by @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the x - ray data indicate that this cluster has recently undergone or is currently undergoing a merger .",
    "feretti et al ( 1997 ) recently analyzed the @xmath0 pspc pointed observation of abell  2255 and came to similar conclusions .",
    "abell  2255 has a very large velocity dispersion , @xmath5 1200 km s@xmath6 , which may indicate that it is dynamically unrelaxed , despite the lack of obvious spatial or kinematical substructure ( stauffer et al .",
    "abell  2255 contains two comparably bright central dominant galaxies , which is reminiscent of the coma cluster . having a pair of central dominant galaxies",
    "is thought to be a sign that the cluster is the merger product of two similarly sized subclusters , each of which had its own central dominant galaxy before the merger ( davis & mushotzky 1993 ; bird 1994 ) .",
    "abell  2255 is also one of the rare clusters which contains a radio halo ( jaffe & rudnick 1979 ; hanisch 1982 ; feretti , et al 1997 ) .",
    "the most recent radio observations ( feretti , et al 1997 ) show that it is @xmath7 mpc in diameter and unpolarized ( which distinguishes it from the numerous polarized tailed sources in this cluster ) . accounting for the rarity of cluster radio halos , as well as their varied morphologies and their energy source(s ) have been long - standing puzzles .",
    "one of the main problems has been understanding how the relativistic electrons which power radio halos get into the outer regions of the clusters where radio halos tend to extend .",
    "tribble ( 1993 ) recently proposed that cluster mergers can provide the energy source for accelerating electrons throughout clusters .",
    "given the short lifetimes of relativistic electrons , it is thought that radio halos are indicative of very recent or @xmath8 cluster mergers .",
    "we present @xmath0 pspc results which strengthen the case for a merger in abell  2255 .",
    "the pspc data show that the cluster has a complex temperature structure , which indicates that the cluster is not in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this , along with the gas and galaxy peaks being offset , the elongated x - ray isophotes in the inner region , and the existence of a radio halo , suggests that abell  2255 is currently experiencing a merger .",
    "we describe the pspc data in  2 and  3 and discuss its analysis in  4 . in  5 we discuss the implications of the data , review the merger evidence in this cluster , and summarize our conclusions .",
    "burns et al ( 1995 ) previously analyzed the 3.5 ksec of _ rosat all sky survey _",
    "pspc data for abell  2255 .",
    "we analyze instead the @xmath0 pspc s 14.5 ksec pointed observation of abell  2255 .",
    "we corrected the x - ray imaging data for spatial variations in the exposure and vignetting , using the procedures outlined in snowden et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "the pspc data were selected from observation times when the _ master veto rate _ ( @xmath9 ) was within recommended bounds : @xmath10 .",
    "the spectra for each of the regions discussed below was extracted from the filtered data .",
    "the background for each spectrum was obtained from an annulus around the cluster extending from 30@xmath11 to 40@xmath11 from its center .",
    "all detectable point sources were excluded from both source and background spectra , using a region size appropriate for the off - axis angle of the source .",
    "source and background spectra were also corrected for vignetting effects and for the residual particle background ( in the manner prescribed by snowden et al .",
    "1994 ) , the latter of which is proportional to the @xmath9 .",
    "finally , the extracted spectra were rebinned so that each channel has a minimum of 25 counts .",
    "we also investigated the effects of using background spectra extracted from regions further from the cluster center , which reduces the cluster s contamination of the background , but increases the vignetting correction ; no significant difference was found in the results .",
    "the morphology of the x - ray gas in abell  2255 can be seen in figure 1 , which shows the pspc image lightly smoothed with a @xmath12 gaussian .",
    "the x - ray contours are elongated in an east - west direction in the center and appear to be more circular in the outer regions .",
    "the x - ray peak of this pointed observation is slightly offset from the brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "fitting the x - ray surface brightness of the cluster confirms that the isophotes are offset from the central dominant galaxies and are fairly flat , with an ellipticity of @xmath130.5 . at larger radii from the center",
    "( @xmath13 215@xmath11 ) , we find the x - ray centroid is stable , but offset from the brightest cluster galaxy by a larger amount , @xmath131@xmath11 .",
    "the position angle of the x - ray isophotes are predominately east - west and the isophotal ellipticities are @xmath140.25 inside 2@xmath11",
    ". burns et al .",
    "( 1995 ) report that the peak of the x - ray @xmath3 image is displaced from the brightest cluster galaxy by about 2@xmath11 .",
    "we do not find such a large offset in the pointed observations .",
    "we used _ xspec  9.0 _ software ( arnaud et al .",
    "1996 ) to fit a raymond - smith plasma model to the extracted spectra .",
    "the temperature and abundance were allowed to vary in the global fit to the cluster .",
    "we also included a variable absorption component due to the column density of galactic hydrogen in the line - of - sight .",
    "the redshift of the model spectrum was fixed to 0.081 , which corresponds to the heliocentric velocity of the cluster given by burns et al .",
    "the extracted spectra were fit between @xmath130.2 and 2.0 kev , the exact energy boundaries being set by the channel grouping . once a minimum in @xmath15 was found , the 90% confidence errors were determined for the free parameters . a ",
    "global \" spectrum extracted from within a radius of 20@xmath11 from the center yields a temperature of 3.71@xmath16 kev and a ( poorly determined ) metal abundance of less than 0.52 solar .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the global temperature of @xmath17 kev found by feretti et al ( 1997 ) , who assumed an abundance of 0.35 solar .",
    "the fitted value of n@xmath18 is 1.43@xmath19 10@xmath20 atoms @xmath21 , less than the galactic value of 2.59@xmath2210@xmath20 atoms @xmath21 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .      to examine the spatial distribution of temperatures",
    ", we extracted spectra from a central core region and from 8 surrounding wedge - shaped regions ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the radius of the central region was chosen to enclose the area where the ( azimuthally averaged ) cluster surface brightness profile shows an excess over the best - fitting analytic king model ( we segregated this  excess \" to optimize a search for the spectral signature of a cooling flow ) .",
    "this resulted in a circular region with radius 15 from the cluster center .",
    "the radii of the surrounding annular wedges were chosen so that each region has @xmath13 10000 counts .    in fitting the spectra from the various subregions , we allowed the absorption column to vary , but we fixed the abundance at 0.3 solar ( since the abundance was poorly determined in the global spectrum ) .",
    "the best - fitting temperature of the core region is 3.49@xmath23 kev and the fitted n@xmath18 is @xmath2410@xmath20 atoms @xmath21 , both of which are consistent with the globally determined values .",
    "there is no sign of a central temperature drop that would indicate the presence of a cooling flow .",
    "cluster cooling flows also tend to be associated with centrally enhanced x - ray absorption , of which we see no evidence .",
    "our core temperature is consistent , within the errors , with the @xmath3 pspc spectral analysis by burns et al ( 1995 ) , who found a core temperature of @xmath25 kev .",
    "the temperatures for all of the individual sectors are shown in figure 2 and figure 3 ; three of the nine regions ( regions 2 , 3 and 9 ) have temperatures that are significantly hotter than the mean cluster temperature of 3.71@xmath16 kev ( which is indicated in figure 3 by horizontal lines ) .      to search for complicated temperature structure in the cluster which may have been missed by using the regular regions in the spectral analysis above",
    ", we generated a spectral ratio map of the cluster .",
    "relatively soft and hard images were constructed from 0.521.31 kev photons ( pspc bands r5 + r6 ) and 1.13  2.01 kev photons ( band r7 ) , respectively .",
    "we used spectral simulations to find that the ratio of these two bands offered the most dynamic range for a plausible range of temperatures in abell  2255 . after smoothing both images with a 1@xmath11 gaussian , the softer image",
    "was then divided by the harder image to create a ratio map .",
    "xspec _ to determine the approximate temperatures corresponding to these ratios .",
    "fixing the abundance to 0.3 solar and n@xmath18 to the best fit value found in the global spectral fit , we find that these ratios are consistent with the temperatures found in the more detailed spectral analysis .",
    "this color map was generated in an attempt to trace the temperature structure of the cluster in more detail than was possible with the large regions used for the previous spectral analysis .",
    "however , because the global gas temperature ( 3.7 kev ) is so far outside the @xmath0 bandpass ( 0.12.0 kev ) , any detail that this method might have revealed is lost in statistical noise .",
    "only one relatively soft feature , northeast of the cluster center , stands out as statistically significant in the color map ; we describe this soft feature below .",
    "figure 4 shows the color ratios for an annular region , 6613@xmath11 about the cluster center , which has been divided into eight equal segments .",
    "all detected point sources were excluded from the calculation , using radii appropriate to the off - axis angles of the sources .",
    "a relatively soft ( larger ratio ) component is clearly seen in the northern portion of the annulus ( 0/360@xmath26 ) .",
    "the position of this soft region , at ra 17@xmath2713@xmath2815@xmath29 dec + 64@xmath30 ( j2000 ) , is not associated with any optical object but is coincident with the diffuse radio ridge discovered by burns et al .",
    "the rough shape of the radio ridge is also seen in the color map and is indicated schematically as an ellipse in figure 1 .",
    "the value of the ratio in this region ( 5.00 @xmath31 1.26 ) corresponds to a temperature of @xmath13 1 kev , which is much cooler than the bulk of the cluster . using an elliptical aperture matched to the shape of the radio ridge we find that the the count rate from this region is 1.1@xmath2210@xmath32 counts s@xmath6 which at the distance of the cluster corresponds to a luminosity of 3.6@xmath2210@xmath33 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "we propose that this cool region is associated with an infalling group of galaxies",
    ". the temperature and luminosity of this cool region are consistent with those of the gas in a poor group of galaxies ( mulchaey et al .",
    "the shocks associated with the entry of a group of galaxies into the cluster can generate the relativistic electrons which power the radio ridge .",
    "abell 2255 shows many signs of an ongoing major merger : a large x - ray core radius , non - circular x - ray isophotes , complex temperature structure , the lack of a cooling flow , a large galaxy velocity dispersion , a pair of central dominant galaxies , and a radio halo .",
    "all of these signs are found in the coma cluster , as well .",
    "simulations of cluster mergers show that strong shocks can heat the gas to @xmath1310 kev ( evrard 1990 ; roettiger et al .",
    "1993 ; schindler & mller 1993 ) .",
    "our pspc temperature map of abell  2255 is too coarse to allow a detailed comparison with merger simulations , but it clearly indicates that there are large , asymmetric temperature variations in the cluster gas .",
    "the gas is particularly hot to the northwest of the core region .",
    "we confirm previous work ( burns et al 1995 ; feretti et al 1997 ) which showed that the x - ray isophotes in the cluster core are also consistent with an ongoing merger : the isophotes are offset from the central dominant galaxies and are fairly flat , with an ellipticity of @xmath130.5 ; the isophotal ellipticity decreases outward until the outer regions are consistent with being round .",
    "a numerical simulation of this proposed merger shows that the x - ray isophotes should be elongated in the direction of the merger ( burns et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "while there are many signs of a major merger in abell  2255 , we also find x - ray evidence of a smaller ongoing merger event : @xmath34 northeast of the cluster center is a relatively cool ( @xmath35 kev ) region , with a luminosity comparable to a poor group of galaxies .",
    "this cool region is coincident with a diffuse radio ridge discovered by burns et al ( 1995 ) ; the relativistic electrons which power this radio source may themselves be powered by shocks driven by an infalling group of galaxies .",
    "we suggest that a large sample of galaxy velocities ( ganguly , hill & oegerle 1996 ) should be searched for kinematic evidence of such an infalling group in the vicinity of ra 17@xmath2713@xmath2815@xmath29 dec + 6413@xmath11 ( j2000 ) .",
    "abell  2255 has evidently joined the ranks of clusters which are known to be undergoing major mergers , and like the coma cluster , has a diffuse radio halo , a pair of dominate central galaxies and a cool group of infalling galaxies . in future work , we will use spatially resolved @xmath1 spectra to prepare a more accurate temperature map for this cluster , to better determine whether abell  2255 is indeed a site of ongoing major and minor subcluster merger events .",
