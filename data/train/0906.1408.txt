    "half - metallic ferromagnets @xcite offer a unique opportunity for studying the electronic states of strongly correlated electron systems . here , only the majority - spin electrons form the fermi surface with a gapped minority - spin band @xcite and can couple with excitations of the spin ( and in some cases orbital ) degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the situation therefore should attract much interest , in particular , when the relevant electrons are strongly correlated , leading the system to double - exchange ferromagnetism @xcite and metal - insulator transition ( mit ) . in this paper",
    ", we will show that a chromium oxide k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 with the hollandite - type crystal structure @xcite belongs to this class of materials and can provide a good opportunity for further development of the physics of strong electron correlations .    the crystal structure of k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) belongs to a group of hollandite - type phases where one - dimensional ( 1d ) double strings of edge - shared cro@xmath3 octahedra forms a cr@xmath4o@xmath2 framework of a tunnel structure , wherein k ions reside.@xcite cr ions are in the mixed - valent state of cr@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) : cr@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 , and hence with 2.25 electrons per cr ion .",
    "it has recently been reported @xcite that the phase transition from the pauli - paramagnetic metal to ferromagnetic metal occurs at @xmath10 k by lowering temperatures , where the ferromagnetic state has a full spin - polarization of 18 @xmath11 per formula unit ( f.u . ) at low temperatures , which is a realization of saturated ferromagnetism .",
    "in addition to this phase transition , it has also been reported @xcite that another phase transition occurs from the ferromagnetic metal to ferromagnetic insulator at @xmath12 k , suggesting that the charge gap opens below @xmath13 .",
    "surprisingly , the spin polarization is hardly affected by this mit and no structural distortions associated with this mit have been observed so far.@xcite the mechanism of the mit of this material has therefore been a great puzzle .",
    "+    in this paper , we perform the first - principles electronic structure calculations based on the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the density - functional theory ( dft ) and we predict that the materials @xmath14cr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( a = k and rb ) belong to a new class of half - metallic ferromagnets , i.e. , the majority - spin electrons are metallic , whereas the minority - spin electrons are semiconducting with a band gap .",
    "we also show from the gga and gga+@xmath15 calculations that the double - exchange mechanism is responsible for the observed saturated ferromagnetism .",
    "we then discuss possible mechanisms of the mit of this material and argue that the formation of an incommensurate , long - wavelength spin and charge density wave ( dw ) due to fermi - surface nesting may be the origin of the mit of this material .",
    "the opening of the gap in the majority - spin band should , however , be detrimental to the double - exchange ferromagnetism , for which we consider possible reconciliations .",
    "we hope that our results will encourage further experimental studies of this intriguing material .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we show our method of calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our results of calculations and discuss the origin of ferromagnetism and possible mechanisms of the mit of k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "summary of our work and prospects for future studies are given in sec .",
    "the electronic structure calculation in gga is carried out by employing the computer code wien2k,@xcite which is based on the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method .",
    "we use the exchange - correlation potential of ref.@xcite .",
    "the spin polarization is allowed .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is not taken into account .",
    "we use 1,221 @xmath16 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone in the self - consistent calculations .",
    "we use the plane - wave cutoff of @xmath17 bohr@xmath18 . the gga+@xmath15 calculation @xcite is also made to see the effects of on - site electron correlation @xmath15 on the band structure .",
    "we assume the experimental crystal structure of k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 observed at room temperature with the lattice constants of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .@xcite the bravais lattice is body - centered tetragonal and the primitive unit cell ( u.c . ) contains four cr ions , one k ion , and eight o ions , i.e. , kcr@xmath21o@xmath1 . the local structure around cr ions is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we use the code xcrysden@xcite for graphical purposes .",
    "the total ground - state energies obtained in gga are @xmath22 ryd / u.c .  in the ferromagnetic state and @xmath23 ryd / u.c .  in the paramagnetic state , resulting in the energy gain of @xmath24 ev / u.c .  due to stabilization by the spin polarization , which is realized already in the gga level . in the ground state",
    ", we have the full spin polarization with the magnetic moment of @xmath25 @xmath11/u.c . , which consists of the contributions from cr ions , 2.043 @xmath11/atom , o(1 ) ions , 0.014 @xmath11/atom , and o(2 ) ions , @xmath26 @xmath11/atom , in the atomic spheres , and @xmath27 @xmath11/u.c .",
    ", in the interstitial region .",
    "note that the o(2 ) ions inside the double strings of cr ions have a negative spin polarization , whereas the o(1 ) ions connecting the double strings have a positive spin polarization .",
    "the calculated density of states ( dos ) is shown in fig .  3 in a wide energy range covering over the o @xmath28 and cr @xmath29 bands .",
    "we find three separate peaks in both the majority and minority spin bands : in the majority ( minority ) spin band , the o @xmath28 weight is located mainly at @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) ev , cr @xmath29 weight with the @xmath32 symmetry at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) ev , and cr @xmath29 weight with the @xmath35 symmetry at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ev .",
    "the hybridization between the o @xmath28 and cr @xmath29 bands is significantly large .",
    "the fermi level is located at a deep valley of the @xmath32 majority - spin band while it is located in the energy gap between the o @xmath28 and cr @xmath29 @xmath32 bands in the minority - spin band .",
    "thus , the half metallicity of this material is evident in the calculated dos .",
    "+    the calculated orbital - decomposed partial dos , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , in the cr @xmath29 @xmath32 region are shown in fig .  4 , where the two components are exactly degenerate , @xmath40 , for both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states .",
    "the three @xmath32 orbitals are almost equally occupied by electrons in the paramagnetic state . in the ferromagnetic state ,",
    "however , the @xmath41 orbitals is almost fully occupied by electrons and therefore holes are only in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals . also , the @xmath41 component has a rather high peak - like structure at @xmath440.7 ev below the fermi level , indicating an essentially localized character of the @xmath41 electrons .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 components , on the other hand , have a rather wide band spreading over @xmath45 ev around the fermi level , indicating an itinerant character of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 electrons . here",
    ", the admixture of the @xmath46 state of o(2 ) is significantly large : it occurs between the @xmath46 orbitals of o(2 ) and the @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals of its neighboring cr ions ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the double - exchange mechanism @xcite should work for the occurrence of ferromagnetism , as will be discussed further below .",
    "+   +      the situation may be clarified further if one observes the calculated band dispersion near the fermi level .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "we find that a rather dispersionless narrow band of predominantly @xmath41 character is located at @xmath440.7 ev below the fermi level , extending over a large region of the brillouin zone . on the other hand , the dispersive @xmath32 bands of predominantly @xmath42 and @xmath43 character with strong admixture of the @xmath46 state of o(2 )",
    "are located at @xmath45 ev and cross the fermi level .",
    "thus , we have the dualistic situation where the essentially localized @xmath41 electrons at @xmath440.7 ev below the fermi level interact with the itinerant @xmath42 and @xmath43 electrons of the bandwidth comparable with the intraatomic exchange energy of @xmath441 ev , whereby the hund s rule coupling gives rise to the ferromagnetic spin polarization via the double - exchange mechanism.@xcite    to support this further , we make the gga+@xmath15 calculation for the present material ( of which the results are not shown here ) .",
    "we find that , as @xmath15 increases , the @xmath41 band shifts further away from the fermi level , leaving essentially no weight above the fermi level , whereas the @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands with strong admixture of the o(2 ) @xmath46 states are much less affected by the presence of @xmath15 .",
    "these results are consistent with what is expected in the double - exchange mechanism of ferromagnetism .",
    "we point out that the situation is very similar to the case of cro@xmath0 , which has so far been discussed in detail.@xcite    another aspect noted in fig .",
    "5 is that we have the semi - metallic band structure in the sense that the number of electrons is equal to the number of holes near the fermi level ( also see fig .  6 below )",
    "; there are 12 bands for the @xmath32 orbitals in the unit cell , which are fully spin - polarized and are occupied by 9 `` spinless fermions '' , i.e. , by 9 up - spin ( or majority - spin ) electrons .",
    "the integer filling of spinless fermions can give rise to either semiconducting or semimetallic band structure , of which the latter is realized in the present system .",
    "this result suggests that the mit observed in k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 can possibly be a semimetal - to - semiconductor transition , where the band gap opens between the lower 9 bands and upper 3 bands due to any unknown reasons . to realize this , however , we need the symmetry reduction ( due to lattice distortion ) because the band degeneracy between the third and fourth bands ( counted from the top of the 12 @xmath32 bands ) at the p point of the brillouin zone can not be lifted without breaking the 4-fold rotational symmetry around the @xmath47 axis of the tetragonal lattice . without the lattice distortion , we could have a zero - gap semiconductor , but the experimental data on the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity @xcite suggest that this possibility should be ruled out . also ,",
    "because no indications of this type of lattice distortions at the mit have been observed so far,@xcite the semimetal - to - semiconductor transition seems to be unrealistic in k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "+   +      the calculated fermi surfaces of k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 in the ferromagnetic state are shown in fig .",
    "there are 12 @xmath32 bands , 3 of which cross the fermi level and form the semimetallic fermi surfaces ; i.e. , the second and third bands ( counted from the top ) form the electron fermi surfaces ( see figs .",
    "6 ( b ) and ( c ) ) and the fourth band forms the hole fermi surface ( see fig .  6(a ) ) .",
    "the wave functions at the fermi surfaces have predominantly @xmath42 and @xmath43 character with large admixture of the o(2 ) @xmath46 states as shown above .",
    "we find in fig .",
    "6(a ) that there is a pair of the 1d - like parallel fermi surfaces , which are seen to have a very good nesting feature .",
    "the nesting vector is aligned roughly along the @xmath48-k@xmath49 direction and has the value @xmath50 or @xmath51 ( a deviation in the @xmath52 component will be discussed below ) .",
    "thus , the fermi - surface instability corresponding to the wavenumber @xmath53 , leading to formation of the incommensurate , long - wavelength ( with a period of @xmath447c in the real space ) dw , may be relevant with the opening of the charge gap in the present material .",
    "note that the spin and charge dws occur simultaneously with the same wavenumber @xmath53 since we have only the up - spin electrons .",
    "+      to confirm the nesting features more precisely , we calculate the generalized susceptibility defined as @xmath54,@xcite where @xmath55 is the band dispersion and @xmath56 is the fermi distribution function at @xmath57 k. the calculated result is shown in fig .  7 , where the contribution from only the 61st band is given . contributions from other bands including interband contributions are rather monotone functions of @xmath16 over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "thus , the peak structure coming from the 61st band remains as a maximum even in the total susceptibility estimated in the constant matrix - element approximation .    to be more precise , the peak structure at @xmath58 and @xmath59 seen in fig .",
    "7 remains strong , irrespective of the value of @xmath52 , although there is a small variation in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "the true maximum appears at @xmath60 , or around @xmath61 , splitting and deviating slightly from @xmath61 in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "thus , if we include the effects of electron correlations , the susceptibility can diverge at this momentum @xmath53 , resulting in the formation of the incommensurate , long - wavelength charge and spin dw , which we hope will be checked by experiment in near future .",
    "+      now , let us discuss possible mechanisms of the mit observed in k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 at @xmath62 k. there are two types of scenarios : ( i ) correlation scenario where the electron correlations play an essential role and ( ii ) band scenario where the band structure solely determines whether the system is metallic or insulating . as a correlation scenario , we may have a possibility of the formation of the incommensurate , long - wavelength charge and spin dw due to the fermi - surface nesting as discussed above .",
    "this may give rise to the opening of the charge gap , resulting in the mit observed in the present material .",
    "as another correlation scenario , we may have the charge ordering ( co ) if the intersite coulombic repulsions between charge carriers are sufficiently strong . in the present system",
    ", there may occur the localization of 3 spinless @xmath32 holes per 4 cr site .",
    "we find that the possible spatial co patterns are equivalent to those of k@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite which results in the doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath47 axis . as a band scenario",
    ", we may have the semimetal - to - semiconductor transition in the present system with the integer filling of spinless fermions as discussed in sec .",
    "iii c. here , no spatial localization of carriers occurs , but the band gap may open if the 4-fold rotational symmetry around the @xmath47 axis is broken due to lattice distortions and the distortion is sufficiently large .",
    "although the lattice distortion is essential for the mit in any of the above cases and its identification can specify which scenario is realized , no structural distortions associated with the metal - insulator transition have been observed so far.@xcite this seems to suggest that the simple distortions such as the doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath47 axis and the breaking of the 4-fold rotational symmetry around the @xmath47 axis may be ruled out .",
    "we therefore argue that the formation of the incommensurate , long - wavelength dw , the observation of which is sometimes not very easy , may be relevant with the mit in the present material .",
    "we hope that the anomaly at @xmath63 estimated above will be sought for carefully in future experiment .",
    "another experimental fact to be noted is that the spin polarization is hardly affected by the mit in this material .",
    "this is interesting because the double - exchange mechanism for ferromagnetism ( of which the energy gain occurs due to the first - order process of the hopping ) should cease to work if the charge gap opens clearly in the majority - spin band and coherent motion of carriers vanishes .",
    "the double - exchange ferromagnetism may be killed in such cases . however ,",
    "if the charge gap is small enough , the second - order processes of the hopping of conduction electrons can give rise to the ferromagnetic interaction between localized spins as well and thus the ferromagnetism can be maintained .",
    "the vanishing first - order process seems to affect very little on the already fully spin - polarized system .",
    "experimentally,@xcite the electrical resistivity measurement shows that the temperature dependence is of a three - dimensional variable - range - hopping type rather than a thermal activation type and thus it is not clear whether the well - defined charge gap is present in this material .",
    "also , the charge gap expected in the formation of the incommensurate , long - wavelength dw state corresponding to @xmath53 may not be so large .",
    "the observed saturated ferromagnetism maintained under the gap formation seems to be related to such situations .",
    "we here point out that the present material k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 is a doped negative charge - transfer - gap ( ct - gap ) type system@xcite in the zaanen - sawatzky - allen phase diagram.@xcite because k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 is in the mixed - valent state , we need not invoke the negative ct - gap situation@xcite for metallization of the system , as is realized in cro@xmath0 where the metallization via self - doping mechanism operates.@xcite however , in a hypothetical k@xmath64cr@xmath1o@xmath2 system , where k ions are completely depleted and all the cr ions are in the @xmath6 state , this self - doping mechanism should be relevant for both metallization and double - exchange ferromagnetism unless the strong electron correlations leads the system to a mott - insulating ground state with spin @xmath65 local moments aligned antiferromagnetically or with local spin - singlet pairs of @xmath65 spins .",
    "we here point out that , even in k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 , the negative ct - gap situation is realized between the o(2 ) @xmath28 and cr @xmath29 @xmath32 orbitals , as is evident in the calculated negative spin - polarization of the o(2 ) ions .",
    "in fact , results of our gga+@xmath15 calculation for k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 indicate that the gap in the dos opens when @xmath15 is large enough although the fermi level is away from the gap due to the mixed - valent nature of the system .",
    "thus , the deficiency of k ions , if realized experimentally , can offer an important opportunity for studying the negative ct - gap situation and its carrier number dependence .",
    "in summary , we have made the first - principles electronic structure calculations and predicted that a chromium oxide k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 of hollandite type should be a half - metallic ferromagnet .",
    "we have shown that the double - exchange mechanism is responsible for the observed saturated ferromagnetism .",
    "we have discussed the possible scenarios of the metal - insulator transition observed at low temperature , which include possibilities of the formation of the charge order and semimetal - to - semiconductor transition , but we have argued that the formation of the incommensurate , long - wavelength density wave of spinless fermions caused by the fermi - surface nesting may be the origin of the opening of the charge gap . we hope that these predictions will be checked by further experimental studies .    before closing this paper , let us discuss some prospects for future studies of this material , which may include the following : + ( i ) this material offers an interesting opportunity for studying the effects of the majority - spin band gap on the electronic properties of half - metallic ferromagnets",
    ". in particular , the so - called non - quasiparticle states @xcite and the effects of the opening of the gap on the non - quasiparticle states should be pursued by the spectroscopic experiments such as photoemission and x - ray absorption experiment.@xcite + ( ii ) the transport properties of k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 are also anomalous,@xcite as those of a `` bad metal'',@xcite which may also be interesting because not only the spin fluctuations but also the collective fluctuations of the orbital degrees of freedom between the degenerate @xmath42 and @xmath43 orbitals may play an important role .",
    "+ ( iii ) introduction of the deficiency of k ions , if it could be made experimentally , would enable us to examine the effects of changing the doping rate on the gap formation , double exchange ferromagnetism , and half metallicity .",
    "we also point out that only the 1d - like fermi surface should remain by @xmath4410% hole doping if we assume the rigid - band shift of the fermi level ( see fig .  5 ) ,",
    "suggesting the realization of the 1d electron system .",
    "+ ( iv ) theoretically , one should study the three - band hubbard model with the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 orbitals to see , in particular , the effects of orbital fluctuations on the electronic states of the system .",
    "the study may be extended to the @xmath66-@xmath67 model including the @xmath28 orbitals of o ions if one wants to take into account the negative ct - gap situation of the present system .",
    "techniques beyond the gga+@xmath15 method , such as the dynamical mean - field theory@xcite and variational cluster approach,@xcite are required to examine the presence of non - quasiparticle states and their deformation due to the gap formation .",
    "finally , we want to point out that , because the basic electronic states of the present system have many aspects in common with those of cro@xmath0 , it may be very useful to clarify similarities and differences in the electronic states between k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 and cro@xmath0 in all the above respects .",
