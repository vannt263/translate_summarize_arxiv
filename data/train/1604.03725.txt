    "with the advent of ultracold gases and trapped ions as tunable quantum simulators , experiments are now in the position to investigate the real - time evolution of quantum many - body systems directly with engineered model hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen tremendous progress that promises new insights at the intersection of condensed matter physics , high energy physics , and beyond @xcite .",
    "while experiments have been very successful in probing the dynamics of quantum many - body systems , it is fair to say that to date our theoretical understanding remains incomplete .",
    "thus , many important problems regarding nonequilibrium quantum dynamics as , e.g. , the characterization of steady states or the calculation of transport properties far from equilibrium are still beyond our reach .",
    "there are several reasons for this disparity . while exact diagonalization provides us with rigorous results it is limited to systems consisting of a small number of particles . the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite allows for the efficient simulation of real - time dynamics for a large variety of one - dimensional gapped quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , its applicability remains largely limited to short times due to the growth of entanglement .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods are not limited by macroscopic quantum correlations , however , their application to nonequilibrium dynamics is hindered by a severe complex phase problem .    in light of these limitations",
    ", it is quite remarkable that a class of open quantum many - body models @xcite can be solved without approximations .",
    "this is of particular interest since open quantum system with engineered couplings to an environment @xcite have been proposed recently for the preparation of quantum states @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite , as well as quantum computing @xcite .",
    "typically , the nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) of the engineered dissipative process , which defines a unique fixed point for the dynamics , is known by construction ; examples include condensates of bosons or @xmath3 states of fermions @xcite , condensates of hardcore bosons or quantum spins @xcite , @xmath4-wave pairing states of fermions @xcite , and various topologically ordered states @xcite .",
    "so far , for most of these systems the real - time evolution leading to the final state is less well understood .",
    "it is known , however , that the dissipative contributions to the dynamics might in fact close the hierarchy of @xmath5-particle correlation functions such that a semi - analytic solution of interacting quantum systems becomes feasible .",
    "this observation has been exploited in a number of works @xcite and general closure conditions for the hierarchy of correlation functions have been derived for bosonic and fermionic models @xcite .    in recent work @xcite , we investigated a protocol for dissipative generation of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , we considered a macroscopic system of @xmath1 spin-@xmath0 particles , where the time evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath6 is governed by a markovian quantum master equation @xcite @xmath7 + \\sum_{\\lambda}\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{l}}_{\\lambda } \\rho \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the dimension of the @xmath1-particle hilbert space .",

    "specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite only a single class of non - hermitian jump operators was considered , which acts on pairs of particles , i.e. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . in the absence of a hamiltonian contribution ( @xmath24 )",
    ", we were able to show that this process yields a closed hierarchy of correlations , thereby allowing us to solve for the full real - time evolution of spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "thus , the dynamics of dissipative bose - einstein condensation could be followed explicitly by studying the relaxation towards the final state @xmath25 , satisfying @xmath26 .    here , we go beyond this first exploratory work and establish the generality of our approach , which allows us to investigate the susceptibility of the considered quantum markov process to unitary and nonunitary perturbations .",
    "specifically , we consider operators @xmath27 that act locally on particles at site @xmath21 , as well as bilocal jump operators @xmath28 that act on pairs of particles @xmath29 , both in the presence and absence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "while multilocal operators @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , are conceivable and have been studied theoretically , e.g. , in the context of steady states with nontrivial topology @xcite , local and bilocal operators appear to be sufficient to describe the phenomenology of engineered dissipative quantum spin-@xmath0 systems for bec generation @xcite .",

    "[ sec : closed hierarchies for correlation functions ] we derive the closure conditions for hierarchies of correlation functions of quantum spin systems in the @xmath32 representation in the case of open markovian dynamics governed by local and bilocal jump operators . in sec .",

    "[ sec : dissipative dynamics in the presence of competing unitary and nonunitary processes ] we investigate the same dissipative process in the presence of thermal noise and a uniform magnetic field .",

    "that is , we derive conditions under which the hierarchy of correlation functions closes for a purely dissipative quantum markov process ( @xmath24 ) defined in terms of local ( sec .",

    "[ subsec : hamiltonian contributions ] .",
    "we start with the discussion of local operators @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) to illustrate the derivation of closure conditions .",
    "any local jump operator can be expressed in the form @xmath41 where the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath20 , are defined up to an overall phase factor , which we may use to set @xmath44 and @xmath45 . since @xmath46 acts locally and spin operators at different sites commute , we observe that the commutator terms in eq .   only contribute when @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( cf .",

    "we observe that the equation of motion closes , i.e. , the equations of motion for @xmath5-point correlation functions do not couple to higher order correlations , independent of the particular form of the local jump operators @xmath46 .",

    "before we go on to discuss the closure conditions for @xmath5-point spin correlation functions , we derive the equation of motion for the local magnetization @xmath91 and investigate under which conditions it decouples from higher order correlation functions .",
