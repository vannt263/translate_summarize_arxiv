    "these laurent polynomials define smooth mappings from @xmath141 into @xmath142 .",
    "note that @xmath143 belongs to the loop lie algebra @xmath144 of the loop lie group @xmath145 . for the resulting solution of the @xmath4-gordon equation to be of finite type , we need in addition the conditions @xmath146 .",

    "moreover , the corresponding @xmath1051 changes the sign at the real branch point , and the arguments concerning simple real branch points in the short segment carry over .",

    "all higher order real branch points within the short segment we deform into pairs of complex conjugate branch points close to the real part and eventually one simple real branch point .",
