    "the sharp rise of @xmath35 for @xmath37 , which is the crucial quantity that determines the statistical efficiency of measuring @xmath27 @xcite is the hallmark of critical slowing down .",
    "how can that be ?",
    "the average amplitudes @xmath38 for @xmath39 are much larger than those for @xmath40 , but the algorithm attempts to move them all at the same maximum pace @xmath11 .",
    "thus the modes close to criticality simply make no headway in comparison to the noncritical ones , and one finds individual ars close to @xmath41 for the relatively few `` small '' @xmath17-vectors , while for larger wave vectors , the numbers of which roughly increase as @xmath42 , ars drop to quite low values .",
    "however , nothing can prevent us from optimizing @xmath43 individually for each @xmath17 in such a way that all modes @xmath7 separately enjoy the same uniform ar . in practice , since changing @xmath44 for one single @xmath17 will influence all other individual ars in a nonlinear way , we resort to a simple iterative procedure , aiming for a fixed collective rule - of - thumb target ar of , say , @xmath32 with a tolerance of @xmath31 during the warm - up stage of the simulation .",
    "excitingly , as soon as this initialization step is implemented , one observes an approximately uniform common value of @xmath35 with only weak @xmath17-dependence . together with the collective nature of the move set ( [ eqn : ncjdcnjxcnlscnckck ] ) , the dramatic suppression of critical slowing down makes this `` optimized fmc '' ( ofmc ) algorithm an interesting alternative in cases where cluster algorithms are difficult to apply .",
    "we illustrate the benefits of the abstract strategy outlined above by considering the numerical determination of the exponent @xmath1 governing the universal elastic properties of solid membranes , a topic of high interest in its own right in molecular biology , medicine and pharmacy , chemical synthesis , and soft matter physics , just to name a few scientific disciplines . owing to the recent meteoric rise of graphene @xcite ,",

    "however , comparing the relative statistical errors of the individual data to their relative deviations from the fit , our high statistical accuracy allows to resolve that most of the deviations remain within the range of the statistical noise of the data except for the smallest nonzero @xmath17-vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 on the cubic lattice , which exceed @xmath88 .",

    "fig : gvonkreldevscollection ] ) . having ruled out trivial explanations for the observed behavior by various consistency checks , we conclude that what see is a finite size effect related to the anisotropic structure of the convolution ( [ eqn : mmsksmkwswkwsmkwsmkwskwsxjsxnsjxnsjsxxm2 ] ) . to extract a numerical estimate of @xmath1 from @xmath78",

    "the ability of a simulation to efficiently sample the scaling region thus depends on the ratio @xmath97 of @xmath98 to the smallest accessible wave vector component @xmath99 .",

    "is replaced by a sum , whose asymptotic scaling behavior should comply to the general form ( [ eqn : sxnnklxmkxmkxmklxlxnxxn ] ) . by definition , an asymptotic scaling law of type ( [ eqn : sxnnklxmkxmkxmklxlxnxxn ] ) allows for various subleading algebraic and logarithmic corrections at finite @xmath92 , we should therefore be included in a fit to the data in order to obtain precise estimates for both @xmath1 and the corresponding error @xmath104 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , however , to the author s best knowledge the structure of these corrections has not been worked out analytically up to date .",
    "we therefore have to allow for a priori unknown subleading corrections of logarithmic as well as power law type .",
    "in addition , analytical and numerical tests based on our crossover ansatz ( [ eqn : sxxmsmxcssoslcc ] ) suggest the inclusion of a constant @xmath105 , such that we arrive at a fss ansatz for @xmath70 of type @xmath106 in which we limit ourselves to including a single positive algebraic correction with exponent @xmath107 .",
    "however , since the trade - off between logarithmic and algebraic corrections for small @xmath107 makes it numerically difficult to obtain meaningful fits , we content ourselves to studying both corrections separately .    a purely logarithmic correction yields the value @xmath108 , but unfortunately this result does not inspire much confidence since the corresponding statistical fitting error is of the order of @xmath109 . turning to algebraic corrections ,",
    "we fix @xmath110 and attempt to fit ( [ eqn : bchbqnqjnxqjxnqsnbqdqwi ] ) to the data with a variable correction exponent @xmath107 , which yields the vague result @xmath111 for @xmath1 , accompanied by the much too imprecise estimate @xmath112 for @xmath107 .",
    "a fit based on fixing @xmath107 to this value produces @xmath113 , but the dependence on the choice of @xmath114 remains unclear . to investigate this problem further , we thus decided to fit the data using the ansatz ( [ eqn : bchbqnqjnxqjxnqsnbqdqwi ] ) for a range of values of @xmath107 .",

    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : omegadependence ] makes it obvious that without precise knowledge of the exponent @xmath107 , fss based on the ansatz ( [ eqn : bchbqnqjnxqjxnqsnbqdqwi ] ) does not allow to extract a reliable result for @xmath1 .",

    "in contrast , an alternative fit based on the somewhat simple - minded ad - hoc ansatz @xmath118 not only yields a comparably good agreement at large @xmath92 ( where any reasonable ansatz for @xmath119 with the correct built - in asymptotics will works equally well ) but apparently also captures the behavior at small @xmath92 with an accuracy that seems very hard to improve any further ( cf .",
