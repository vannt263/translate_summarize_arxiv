    "there are lots of unstable particles ( resonances ) observed in particle physics experiments  @xcite .",
    "they have very short lifetimes .",
    "for example , the decay width of the @xmath6 meson is around 150 mev , and its half - life is only about @xmath7  s. to calculate their lifetimes ( or their decay widths equivalently ) , theoretical physicists usually use the field theory and the scattering theory based on statistics .",
    "however , since their lifetimes are so short that we might find some physics not only in the sense of probability .    in this paper",
    "we shall study the decay process of unstable particles . for simplicity",
    ", we shall concentrate on those particles which mainly decay into two final states in a very short time .",
    "we shall estimate how far at most these two final states can travel away from each other in this short time .",
    "we shall not use the field theory nor the scattering theory , but just study their motion using the theory of relativity  @xcite .",
    "we shall do these calculations at the hadron level so that we can consider the motion of all valence quarks and sea quarks .",
    "our assumptions are very simple and straightforward : the initial state , an unstable particle @xmath8 , is at rest in the beginning ; it has mass @xmath9 and decay width @xmath10 ; it decays into two particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , having masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively ; when @xmath8 is decaying into @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the mass difference between the initial and final states , @xmath15 , is totally and immediately transferred into kinetic energies of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; this makes they have speeds @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in opposite direction .",
    "this process can be easily described using the following equations : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is just the farthest distance that @xmath11 and @xmath12 can travel away from each other in the half - life of @xmath8 .",
    "we can use the uncertainty principle @xmath21 to estimate the theoretical uncertainty of @xmath22 : @xmath23    we use the well - established @xmath6 meson and @xmath24 baryon as examples and show some numbers here .",
    "the mass of the @xmath6 meson is measured to be around 770 mev .",
    "it decays into two pions , whose masses are both around 138 mev . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : motion1 ] ) and ( [ eq : motion2 ] ) we can calculate their speeds : @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the decay width of the @xmath6 meson is around 150 mev , and so its half - life is around @xmath7 s. during this short time , the distance @xmath27 that the two pions can travel away from each other at most is around 2.5 fm , and its theoretical error bar from the uncertainty principle is @xmath28 fm .",
    "the mass of the @xmath24 baryon is measured to be around 1232 mev .",
    "it decays into one nucleon and one pion , whose masses are around 939 mev and 138 mev , respectively . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : motion1 ] ) and ( [ eq : motion2 ] ) we can calculate their speeds : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the decay width of the @xmath24 baryon is around 117 mev , and so its half - life is around @xmath31 s. during this short time , the distance @xmath32 that the nucleon and the pion can travel away from each other at most is around 1.8 fm , and its theoretical error bar from the uncertainty principle is @xmath33 fm .    in this paper",
    "we shall calculate the distance @xmath22 for 181 hadrons , among all the 324 ones listed in pdg2012 together with @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we shall find that it is smaller for many other hadrons than @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "for example , @xmath34 is around 1.06@xmath351.43 fm , @xmath36 is around 0.41@xmath350.85 fm , and @xmath37 is around 0.39@xmath350.66 fm . as we know , the order of magnitude of the hadronic radii is about one femtometer  @xcite .",
    "particularly , we would like to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite m.  albaladejo and j.  a.  oller obtained the quadratic scalar radius of the @xmath38 meson using the unitary chiral perturbation theory , that is @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "these hadronic radii are sometimes larger than @xmath22 , the distance that the two final states can travel away from each other at most in the half - life of @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , if we assume that the initial and final hadrons are all spherical , the two final states might not separate geometrically even after the whole decay process . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss this problem and try to find out what kinds of states may not be observed in the experiments due to their small lifetimes .",
    "in this paper we shall also investigate altogether 15 unstable nuclei  @xcite , which mainly decay into two final nuclei in a very short time .",
    "we shall perform similar calculations and estimate the distance @xmath22 for them .",
    "we find it is about several femtometers for some of them , which number is of the same order of magnitude as the nuclear radii .",
    "for example , the distance @xmath41 is about 5.26@xmath356.08 fm , and its theoretical error bar from the uncertainty principle is @xmath42 fm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we shall estimate the distance @xmath22 for some unstable hadrons ; the calculations will be done separately for light mesons , heavy mesons , light baryons and heavy baryons in sec .",
    "[ sec : lightmeson ] , [ sec : heavymeson ] , [ sec : lightbaryon ] and [ sec : heavybaryon ] , respectively ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : unstablenuclei ] we shall estimate the distance @xmath22 for some unstable nuclei ; sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to a short summary and discussions .",
    "in this section we shall estimate the distance @xmath22 for altogether 181 hadrons , among all the 324 ones listed in pdg2012 together with @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we shall separately investigate light mesons , heavy mesons , light baryons and heavy baryons in the following subsections .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate light mesons consisting of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 quarks . we take into account 75 light mesons among all the 101 ones listed in pdg2012  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the distance @xmath22 for them . the results for light unflavored mesons are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : lightmesons ] , and the results for strange mesons are listed in tab .  [ tab : strangemesons ] .",
    "we also show their decay modes there , where only the spin and parity conservation is taken into account .",
    "other 26 ones are not taken into account , including :    1 .",
    "mesons whose decay widths are smaller than 1 mev : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ; 2 .",
    "mesons which mainly decay into three final states , or only the three - body decay patterns are listed in pdg2012  @xcite : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; 3 .",
    "mesons whose masses are below the threshold of the ( dominant ) final states : @xmath53  @xcite and @xmath54  @xcite ; 4 .",
    "mesons whose masses and decay patterns are not well known : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    here",
    "different isospin partners are counted just once .",
    "for example , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are together denoted as @xmath46 .    to see the results more clearly , we draw the function @xmath74 in fig .  [",
    "fig : lightmeson ] , where @xmath75 is defined for each light meson @xmath8 : @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the unit step function , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the lower and upper bounds of @xmath22 which have been calculated and listed in tabs .  [",
    "tab : lightmesons ] and [ tab : strangemesons ] .",
    "we set @xmath80 fm and @xmath81 fm for those having no lower and upper bounds .",
    "if the particle @xmath8 has more than one important ( non - negligible ) decay partners as explicitly listed in pdg2012  @xcite , we choose the one having the largest branching ratio and use @xmath82 to denote it .",
    "this is because it is not very likely that a decay pattern having a larger branching ratio can be fully produced by the final state interaction of a decay pattern having a smaller branching ratio .",
    "we can easily verify @xmath83 and so we call @xmath84 the probability ( density ) function .    from its definition eq .",
    "( [ def : probability ] ) we may guess that : if masses and decay widths are randomly distributed , the probability function @xmath84 would become larger as @xmath85 becomes smaller , because @xmath86 is normalized and the denominator @xmath87 becomes smaller as @xmath85 becomes smaller ; if we set an upper bound for decay widths , the probability function @xmath84 would become zero as @xmath85 goes to zero , due to its definition .",
    "therefore , it should have a maximum , which is related to the ( observed ) minimum lifetimes of hadrons . from fig .",
    "[ fig : lightmeson ] we find its maximum is around one femtometer , which number is of the same order of magnitude as the hadronic radii .",
    ".the distance @xmath22 for light unflavored mesons .",
    "some of them have more than one important ( non - negligible ) decay partners as explicitly listed in pdg2012  @xcite , and we use @xmath82 to denote the one used in the data analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : unstablenuclei ]",
    "to summarize this paper , we have investigated unstable hadrons ( resonances ) which mainly decay into two final states in a very short time .",
    "we have taken into account 181 hadrons , among all the 324 ones listed in pdg2012 together with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have estimated how far at most the two final states can travel away from each other in the half - life of the initial unstable hadron . synthesizing all the data obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , we draw the probability function @xmath88 at the bottom of figs .  [",
    "fig : totalhadron ] , where @xmath86 is defined for each unstable hadron @xmath8 investigated in this paper .",
    "we find the distance @xmath22 is around one femtometer for many hadrons , which number is of the same order of magnitude as the hadronic radii .",
    "we have also estimated this distance @xmath22 for altogether 15 unstable nuclei .",
    "we find that in many cases it is about several femtometres , which number is of the same order of magnitude as the nuclear radii .    based on these results",
    ", we would like to discuss the structure of hadrons , and ask several questions :    1 .",
    "the first question is whether the time for the final states to separate geometrically should be counted in the decay process .",
    "we use the unstable nucleus @xmath89o as an example . from tab .  [",
    "tab : unstablenuclei ] , we find that @xmath90-@xmath91 fm . assuming the @xmath89o nucleus is close - packed , the distance that the outermost proton needs to run away from the rest @xmath92n nucleus is similar to the proton radius @xmath93 fm ( or its diameter @xmath94 fm )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath89o , its final states , the @xmath92n nucleus and the proton , have enough time to separate geometrically during its decay process .",
    "the same situation happens to other unstable nuclei , and so the answer to the first question can be yes for the case of unstable nuclei .",
    "+ masses of heavy hadrons are of the same order of magnitude as masses of light nuclei , and so we might think this answer is the same for the case of heavy hadrons . however , the distance @xmath22 is less than one femtometer for many hadrons including heavy ones , which number is of the same order of magnitude as the hadronic radii .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain these results we have assumed that the mass difference is totally and immediately transferred into kinetic energies , and so the actual distance that the two final states travel away from each other in the half - life of the initial unstable hadron can be even smaller . in such cases , if we assume that the initial hadron is spherical in the beginning and the two final hadrons are both spherical in the end , the two final states may not separate geometrically even after the whole decay process . therefore",
    ", if the answer to the first question is yes , it seems that many hadrons may have a molecular structure , a non - spherical shape like oval , or even a separated two - body structure like halo nuclei .",
    "the second question is whether these short - lived hadrons have already started to decay before they are well formed .",
    "this question is related to the first question .",
    "if the answers to both questions are yes , the distance @xmath22 can be as small as one femtometer no matter what shapes the initial and final hadrons have .",
    "in such cases the initial hadron are not well produced and the two final states behave like being connected by some `` springs '' but they quickly disconnect with each other . however ,",
    "if the total distance travelled at most , @xmath22 ( or @xmath95 starting from their production ) , is too small , they would become difficult to be observed in experiments .",
    "+ now we try to answer the question raised in the title : how fast can an unstable particle decay into two final states and be observed ? from tab .",
    "[ tab : lightmesons ] to tab .",
    "[ tab : charmedbottombaryons ] , we find that the distance @xmath22 is larger than 0.3 fm for all the hadrons having a lower bound on @xmath22 , except @xmath96 fm and @xmath97 fm .",
    "however , in these two cases , the theoretical error bars from the uncertainty principle are both large : @xmath98 fm and @xmath99 fm .",
    "consequently , we use this restriction @xmath100 fm to plot several curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : limitation ] , where the two final states are set to be @xmath46-@xmath46 , @xmath48-@xmath46 , @xmath101-@xmath46 , @xmath102-@xmath103 , @xmath104-@xmath46 and @xmath104-@xmath48 . the unstable hadrons which can be observed in experiments should be inside the regions @xmath105 fm .",
    "+ since this restriction is not so strict , we also plot the curves obtained by fixing @xmath106 fm .",
    "revelent hadrons are shown in these figures for comparisons .",
    "the unstable hadrons inside ( or not far from ) the regions @xmath107 fm can be more easily observed .",
    "particularly , we show @xmath108 in the middle - right figure , where @xmath109 mev , @xmath110 mev , @xmath111 mev and @xmath112 mev  @xcite .",
    "it is coincident with the beginnings of the curves @xmath113 fm and @xmath114 fm . from these figures ,",
    "we quickly notice that these restrictions are more strict on heavy hadrons than on light hadrons .",
    "the third question is whether there are still hadrons which have large decay widths but can not be observed due to the small @xmath22 . to answer this question , we draw the probability function @xmath88 at the top and in the middle of figs .",
    "[ fig : totalhadron ] , where @xmath86 is defined for each light hadron and each heavy hadron , respectively . for both cases probability functions",
    "have maxima when @xmath22 is around one femtometer .",
    "we also draw the probability function @xmath84 for different decay modes in fig .  [",
    "fig : partialwave ] .",
    "we find no significant differences among hadrons decaying through @xmath115-wave , @xmath116-wave and the other waves , although it seems that @xmath115-wave decay patterns should lead to larger decay widths and so smaller @xmath22 .",
    "these two comparisons suggest that the answer to the third question is yes . consequently , if we take a look at fig .",
    "[ fig : heavybaryon ] again , it suggests that there may be some heavy baryons having decay widths around 100 - 200 mev and waiting to be observed .",
