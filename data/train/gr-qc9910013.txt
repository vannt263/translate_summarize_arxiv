    "understanding the origin of black hole entropy is one of the most interesting problems in black hole physics .",
    "the black hole entropy is given by the bekenstein - hawking formula  @xcite as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is area of the horizon .",
    "it seems that full understanding of black hole entropy requires the theory of quantum gravity , which we do not know yet .",
    "however , we believe that general feature of black hole entropy can be understood by semiclassical theory , namely , quantum field theory in a fixed gravitational background .",
    "in fact , the brick wall model proposed by thooft  @xcite succeeded to derive the proportionality of black hole entropy to the horizon area by identifying the black hole entropy with thermal entropy of ambient quantum fields raised to the hawking temperature .",
    "it was recently clarified that in this model backreaction is small enough and that this model is actually a self - consistent model as a semiclassical theory  .",
    "moreover , it was shown that this model seeks the maximal value of entanglement entropy in the space of states whose backreaction is small enough  @xcite .    originally , the brick wall model is proposed in the spherically symmetric , static background , say , the schwarzschild background .",
    "hence , it seems interesting to see how this model is extended to a rotating background , say , the kerr background  .",
    "however , it is known that in a rapidly rotating spacetime without horizon a field has complex - frequency modes   and that there is the so called ergoregion instability  @xcite .",
    "thus , it might be expected that the brick - wall model in rotating background might be unstable and unsuitable for the origin of black hole entropy .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the stability of the brick wall model in a rotating background .",
    "we show that the time scale of the ergoregion instability is much longer than the relaxation time scale of the thermal state with the hawking temperature . in the latter time",
    "scale ambient fields should settle in the thermal state .",
    "thus , the brick wall model is well defined even in a rotating background .    in sec .",

    "thus , the brick wall model is well defined if the inner boundary is sufficiently close to the horizon .",

    "first , for a rotating black hole background , there is no complex frequency mode  @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that superradiant modes of fields are amplified by scattering . on the other hand , for the brick wall ( or a rapidly rotating star ) background ,",
    "the amplification of superradiant modes can be suppressed by a boundary condition say , the dirichlet boundary condition at the inner boundary  @xcite . in stead of the amplification of superradiant modes , as shown in this paper , for this background there appear complex frequency modes .",
    "these complex frequency modes are outgoing and incoming normal modes of the field and may be understood intuitively as `` quasi - bound states '' in the ergoregion .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : quasi - bound - state ] ) . )",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the fact that for a black hole background there is no complex frequency mode since there is no `` quasi - bound state '' in the ergoregion : any excitations with negative energy w.r.t .",
    "observers at infinity will fall into the hole .",
    "based on this observation , thus , it is expected that in the brick wall background the imaginary part of the complex frequency should become arbitrarily small in the limit that the inner boundary becomes close enough to the horizon since in this limit there appears a large room for the excitations with negative energy w.r.t .",
    "observers at infinity to escape to .",
    "this consideration is , off course , consistent with our result in this paper : we have shown that the imaginary part of the complex frequency can be small enough compared with the time scale determined by the hawking temperature if the inner boundary is sufficiently close to the horizon , say at a proper altitude of planck scale .",
    "next , let us discuss a relation to the so called schiff - snyder - weinberg effect  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the relation between the klein paradox  @xcite and superradiance in a rotating black hole background was discussed in detail by using a rectilinear model of the kerr spacetime .",
    "since the situation in the klein paradox can be understood as a limit ( the so called klein limit ) of the schiff - snyder - weinberg effect  @xcite , the situation in a rotating black hole background should be understood as a limit of our situation , i.e. the brick wall model .",
    "this is actually the case : in the @xmath132 limit the complex frequencies in the brick wall background disappear as in the kerr black hole or in the rectilinear spacetime considered in ref .",

    "finally , we would like to mention a possibility to stabilize the quantum field theory in a rotating background by introducing a nonlinear interaction . in refs .",

    "<S> the stability of the brick wall model is analyzed in a rotating background . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in the kerr background without horizon but with an inner boundary a scalar field has complex - frequency modes and that , however , the imaginary part of the complex frequency can be small enough compared with the hawking temperature if the inner boundary is sufficiently close to the horizon , say at a proper altitude of planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the time scale of the instability due to the complex frequencies is much longer than the relaxation time scale of the thermal state with the hawking temperature . </S>",
    "<S> since ambient fields should settle in the thermal state in the latter time scale , the instability is not so catastrophic . </S>",
