    "for the past three decades or so the holy grail sought by particle / nuclear knights has been to verify the correctness of the `` ultimate '' theory of strong interactions  quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the theory is , of course , deceptively simple on the surface . indeed",
    "the form of the lagrangian ] where @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) are the su(3 ) gell - mann matrices , operating in color space , and the color - field tensor is defined by @xmath4   \\ , , \\ ] ] ] @xmath5 is elegant , and the theory is renormalizable .",
    "so why are we still not satisfied ?",
    "while at the very largest energies , asymptotic freedom allows the use of perturbative techniques , for those who are interested in making contact with low energy experimental findings there exist at least three fundamental difficulties :    * qcd is written in terms of the `` wrong '' degrees of freedom  quarks and gluons  while low energy experiments are performed with hadronic bound states ; * the theory is non - linear due to gluon self interactions ; * the theory is one of strong coupling@xmath6so that perturbative methods are not practical .",
    "nevertheless , there has been a great deal of recent progress in making contact between theory and experiment using the technique of \" effective field theory  , which exploits the chiral symmetry of the qcd interaction .",
    "in order to understand how this is accomplished , we first review symmetry breaking as well as the concept of effective interactions . then we show how these ideas can be married via chiral perturbation theory and indicate a few contemporary physics applications .",
    "the importance of symmetry in physics is associated with noether s theorem , which states that associated with any symmetry in physics is a corresponding conservation law .",
    "thus , for example ,    * translation invariance implies conservation of momentum ; * time translation invariance implies conservation of energy ; * rotational invariance implies conservation of angular momentum    these , however , are perhaps the only exact symmetries in nature .",
    "all others are broken in some way and there are in general only three types of symmetry breaking which can occur :    _ explicit _ : the most familiar is _ explicit _ symmetry breaking , wherein the breaking occurs in the lagrangian itself .",
    "as an example , consider the harmonic oscillator lagrangian @xmath7 which is clearly symmetric under spatial inversion@xmath8 . correspondingly , the ground state ( lowest energy ) configuration@xmath9 , which is found via @xmath10also shares this symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "if we add a linear potential ( constant force ) into the system , the lagrangian becomes @xmath11 the ground state is now given by @xmath12 , which no longer is invariant under spatial inversion , but this is to be expected because of the _ explicit _ symmetry breaking term@xmath13in the lagrangian .",
    "_ spontaneous _ : less familiar but still relatively common is _ spontaneous _ symmetry breaking , wherein the lagrangian of a system possesses a symmetry but the ground state does not .",
    "a simple classical physics example of this is the case of a thin hoop of radius @xmath14 immersed in a gravitational field and rotating about a vertical axis at fixed angular velocity @xmath15 .",
    "a bead which can move without friction along the hoop is then described by the lagrangian@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the angle subtended by the bead from the bottom of the hoop .",
    "clearly the lagrangian is invariant under reflection@xmath18but the ground state configuration is given by @xmath19 which has the stable equilibirium solution @xmath20 _ or _",
    "@xmath21 if @xmath22 . obviously in this situation the ground state breaks the symmetry under @xmath23 , even though the lagrangian does not  this is an example of _ spontaneous _ symmetry breaking .    _",
    "anomalous _ : finally , we consider _ anomalous _ or quantum mechanical symmetry breaking wherein the lagrangian at the classical level is symmetric , but the symmetry is broken upon quantization .",
    "obviously there are no classical physics examples of this phenomenon and , to my knowledge , every manifestation except one is in the arena of quantum field theory .",
    "the one example from ordinary quantum mechanics involves the breaking of scale invariance by a two - dimensional delta function potential@xcite . to set the stage ,",
    "first consider a _",
    "free _ particle of mass @xmath24 , which satisfies the time - independent schrodinger equation @xmath25 a general partial wave solution can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 satisfies the differential equation @xmath28 obviously there exists a scale invariance here  the schrodinger equation is invariant under the scale transformation @xmath29 , a consequence of which is that the solution must be a function only of @xmath30 _ times _ @xmath31 and not of @xmath30 or @xmath31 alone .",
    "for example , a free particle solution can be written in the form @xmath32 note that there exists a phase shift @xmath33 of the outgoing spherical wave with respect to its incoming counterpart .",
    "this phase shift is , however , @xmath34 as required by scale invariance . on the other hand",
    "if we include a potential @xmath35 then the solution has the asymptotic form @xmath36 where the scattering amplitude @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 in this case there exists an additional phase shift @xmath39 in each partial wave , which breaks the scale invariance , but this is to be expected because of the presence of the ( symmetry violating ) potential .    in the case of two dimensions , one can write the scattering wave function in the asymptotic form @xmath40 with scattering amplitude @xmath41 where now we expand in terms of exponentials @xmath42 instead of legendre polynomials .",
    "what is special about two dimensions is that it is possible to introduce a _ scale invariant",
    "_ potential @xmath43 .",
    "the associated differential cross section is found to be @xmath44 which corresponds to pure @xmath45 scattering with an energy dependent phase shift @xmath46 the scale invariance present at the classical level ( no scattering cross section since we have a delta function potential ) is then violated upon quantization .    interestingly , qcd makes use of all three forms of symmetry breaking !",
    "the power of effective field theory is associated with the feature that there exist many situations in physics involving two scales , one heavy and one light .",
    "then if one is working at energies small compared to the heavy scale , one can fully describe the interactions in terms of an `` effective '' picture , which is written only in terms of the light degrees of freedom , but which fully includes the influence of the heavy mass scale through virtual effects .",
    "a number of good review articles exist concerning the subject@xcite .    before proceeding to qcd , however , it is useful to study this idea in the simpler context of ordinary quantum mechanics , in order to get familiar with the concept .",
    "specifically , we examine the question of why the sky is blue , whose answer can be found in an analysis of the scattering of photons from the sun by atoms in the atmosphere ",
    "compton scattering@xcite .",
    "first we examine the problem using traditional quantum mechanics and consider elastic ( rayleigh ) scattering from ( for simplicity ) single - electron ( hydrogen ) atoms .",
    "the appropriate hamiltonian is then @xmath47 and the leading@xmath48amplitude for compton scattering is given by the kramers - heisenberg form @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 represents the hydrogen ground state having binding energy @xmath51 .",
    "here the leading component is the familiar @xmath15-independent thomson amplitude and would appear naively to lead to an energy - independent cross - section .",
    "however , this is not the case . indeed , by expanding in powers of @xmath15 and using a few quantum mechanical tricks",
    ", then provided that the energy of the photon is much smaller than a typical excitation energy  as is the case for optical photons  the cross section can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the atomic electric polarizability , @xmath54 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath55 is a typical hydrogen excitation energy .",
    "we note that @xmath56 is of order the atomic volume , as will be exploited below , and that the cross section itself has the characteristic @xmath57 dependence which leads to the blueness of the sky ",
    "blue light scatters much more strongly than red@xcite .",
    "now while the above derivation is certainly correct , it requires somewhat detailed and lengthy quantum mechanical manipulations which obscure the relatively simple physics involved .",
    "one can avoid these problems by the use of effective field theory methods .",
    "the key point is that of scale .",
    "since the incident photons have wavelengths @xmath58a much larger than the @xmath59 1a atomic size , then at leading order the photon is insensitive to the presence of the atom , since the latter is electrically neutral .",
    "if @xmath0 represents the wavefunction of the atom , then the effective leading order hamiltonian is simply @xmath60 and there is _ no _ interaction with the field . in higher orders , there _ can _ exist such atom - field interactions and this is where the effective hamiltonian comes in to play .",
    "in order to construct the effective interaction , we demand certain general principles  this hamiltonian must satisfy fundamental symmetry requirements .",
    "in particular @xmath61 must be gauge invariant , must be a scalar under rotations , and must be even under both parity and time reversal transformations .",
    "also , since we are dealing with compton scattering , @xmath61 should be quadratic in the vector potential .",
    "actually , from the requirement of gauge invariance it is clear that the effective interaction can utilize only the electric and magnetic fields @xmath62 since these are invariant under a gauge transformation @xmath63 while the vector and/or scalar potentials are not .",
    "the lowest order interaction then can involve only the rotational invariants @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , under spatial inversion@xmath66electric and magnetic fields behave oppositely@xmath67 while @xmath68so that parity invariance rules out any dependence on @xmath65 .",
    "likewise under time reversal@xmath69we have @xmath70 but @xmath71 so such a term is also ruled out by time reversal invariance .",
    "the simplest such effective hamiltonian must then have the form @xmath72\\label{eq : ll}\\ ] ] ( terms involving time or spatial derivatives are much smaller . ) we know from electrodynamics that @xmath73 represents the field energy per unit volume , so by dimensional arguments , in order to represent an energy in eq .",
    "[ eq : ll ] , @xmath74 must have dimensions of volume .",
    "also , since the photon has such a long wavelength , there is no penetration of the atom , so only classical scattering is allowed .",
    "the relevant scale must then be atomic size so that we can write @xmath75 where we anticipate @xmath76 . finally , since for photons with polarization @xmath77 and four - momentum @xmath78 we identify @xmath79 , then from eq .",
    "[ eq : ii ] , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 as found in the previous section via detailed calculation .",
    "clearly the effective interaction method provides and efficient and insightful way in which to perform the calculation .",
    "now let s apply these ideas to the case of qcd .",
    "the relevant invariance in this case is `` chiral symmetry . ''",
    "the idea of `` chirality '' is defined by the operators @xmath83 which project left- and right - handed components of the dirac wavefunction via @xmath84 in terms of these chirality states the quark component of the qcd lagrangian can be written as @xmath85 the reason that these chirality states are called left- and right - handed can be seen by examining helicity eigenstates of the free dirac equation . in the high energy ( or massless ) limit we note that @xmath86    left- and right - handed helicity eigenstates then can be identified as @xmath87 but @xmath88 so that in this limit chirality is identical with helicity @xmath89 with this background , we now return to qcd and observe that in the limit as @xmath90 @xmath91 would be invariant under _ independent _ global left- and right - handed rotations @xmath92 ( of course , in this limit the heavy quark component is also invariant , but since @xmath93 it would be silly to consider this as even an approximate symmetry in the real world . )",
    "this invariance is called @xmath94 or chiral @xmath95 . continuing to neglect the light quark masses",
    ", we see that in a chiral symmetric world one would expect to have sixteen  eight left - handed and eight right - handed  conserved noether currents @xmath96 equivalently , by taking the sum and difference , we would have eight conserved vector and eight conserved axial vector currents @xmath97 in the vector case , this is just a simple generalization of isospin ( su(2 ) ) invariance to the case of su(3 ) .",
    "there exist _ eight _ ( @xmath98 ) time - independent charges @xmath99 and there exist various supermultiplets of particles having identical spin - parity and ( approximately ) the same mass in the configurations ",
    "singlet , octet , decuplet , _ etc . _ demanded by su(3 ) invariance .",
    "if chiral symmetry were realized in the conventional fashion one would expect there also to exist corresponding nearly degenerate same spin but _ opposite _ parity states generated by the action of the time - independent axial charges @xmath100 on these states . indeed since @xmath101",
    "we see that @xmath102 must also be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian with the same eigenvalue as @xmath103 , which would seem to require the existence of parity doublets .",
    "however , experimentally this does not appear to be the case . indeed",
    "although the @xmath104 nucleon has a mass of about 1 gev , the nearest @xmath105 resonance lies nearly 600 mev higher in energy . likewise in the case of the @xmath106 pion , which has",
    "a mass of about 140 mev , the nearest corresponding @xmath107 state ( if it exists at all ) is nearly 700 mev or so higher in energy .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox is that the axial symmetry is spontaneously broken , in which case goldstone s theorem requires the existence of eight massless pseudoscalar bosons , which couple derivatively to the rest of the universe .",
    "that way the state @xmath108 is equivalent to @xmath109 , where @xmath110 signifies one of these massless bosons , and in this way the problem of parity doublets is avoided . of course ,",
    "in the real world such massless @xmath106 states do not exist .",
    "this is because in the real world exact chiral invariance is broken by the small quark mass terms which we have neglected up to this point .",
    "thus what we have in reality are eight very light ( but not massless ) pseudo - goldstone bosons which make up the pseudoscalar octet .",
    "since such states are lighter than their other hadronic counterparts , we have a situation wherein effective field theory can be applied ",
    "provided one is working at energy - momenta small compared to the @xmath111 gev scale which is typical of hadrons , one can describe the interactions of the pseudoscalar mesons using an effective lagrangian .",
    "actually this has been known since the 1960 s , where a good deal of work was done with a _",
    "lowest order _ effective chiral lagrangian@xcite @xmath112 where the subscript 2 indicates that we are working at two - derivative order or one power of chiral symmetry breaking_i.e .",
    "_ @xmath113 . here",
    "@xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the pion decay constant .",
    "this lagrangian is _",
    "unique_if we expand to lowest order in @xmath116 @xmath117 we reproduce the free pion lagrangian , as required .    at the su(3 ) level , including a generalized chiral symmetry breaking term , there is even predictive power  one has @xmath118",
    "@xmath119 where @xmath120 is a constant and @xmath24 is the quark mass matrix .",
    "we can then identify the meson masses as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the mean light quark mass .",
    "this system of three equations is _ overdetermined _ , and we find by simple algebra @xmath123 which is the gell - mann - okubo mass relation and is well - satisfied experimentally@xcite .",
    "expanding to fourth order in the fields we also reproduce the well - known and experimentally successful weinberg @xmath124 scattering lengths .",
    "however , when one attempts to go beyond tree level , in order to unitarize the results , divergences arise and that is where the field stopped at the end of the 1960 s .",
    "the solution , as proposed a decade later by weinberg@xcite and carried out by gasser and leutwyler@xcite , is to absorb these divergences in phenomenological constants , just as done in qed .",
    "what is different in this case is that the theory is nonrenormalizabile in that the forms of the divergences are _ different _ from the terms that one started with .",
    "that means that the form of the counterterms that are used to absorb these divergences must also be different , and gasser and leutwyler wrote down the most general counterterm lagrangian that one can have at one loop , involving _ four - derivative _ interactions @xmath125 ^ 2+l_2{\\rm tr } ( d_{\\mu}ud_{\\nu}u^{\\dagger})\\cdot { \\rm tr } ( d^{\\mu}ud^{\\nu}u^{\\dagger } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & l_3{\\rm tr } ( d_{\\mu}u d^{\\mu}u^{\\dagger } d_{\\nu}u d^{\\nu}u^{\\dagger } ) + l_4 { \\rm tr }   ( d_{\\mu}u d^{\\mu}u^{\\dagger } ) { \\rm tr } ( \\chi{u^{\\dagger}}+u{\\chi}^{\\dagger } ) \\nonumber",

    "for applications invlolving nucleons it is important to note that the same ideas can be applied within the sector of meson - nucleon interactions , although with a bit more difficulty .",
    "again much work has been done in this regard@xcite , but there remain important challenges@xcite .",
    "writing the lowest order chiral lagrangian at the su(2 ) level is straightforward @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the usual nucleon axial coupling in the chiral limit , the covariant derivative @xmath134 is given by @xmath135-{i\\over 2}u^\\dagger ( v_\\mu+a_\\mu)u-{i\\over 2}u(v_\\mu - a_\\mu)u^\\dagger , \\ ] ] and @xmath136 represents the axial structure @xmath137 expanding to lowest order , we find @xmath138 which yields the goldberger - treiman relation , connecting strong and weak couplings of the nucleon system@xcite @xmath139 using the present best values for these quantities , we find    @xmath140    and the agreement to",
    "better than two percent strongly confirms the validity of chiral symmetry in the nucleon sector .",
    "actually the goldberger ",
    "treiman relation is only strictly true at the unphysical point @xmath141 and one _ expects _ about a  1% discrepancy to exist .",
    "an interesting `` wrinkle '' in this regard is the use of the so - called dashen - weinstein relation , which accounts for lowest order su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects , to predict this discrepancy in terms of corresponding numbers in the strangeness changing sector@xcite .",
    "however , any realistic approach must also involve loop calculations as well as the use of a foldy - wouthuysen transformation in order to assure proper power counting .",
    "this approach goes under the name of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath0pt ) and interested readers can find a compendium of such results in the review article@xcite . for our purposes we shall have to be content to examine just one application ",
    "measurement of the _ generalized _ proton _ polarizability _ via virtual compton scattering .",
    "first recall from section 3 the concept of polarizability as the constant of proportionality between an applied electric or magnetizing field and the resultant induced electric or magnetic dipole moment @xmath142 the corresponding interaction energy is @xmath143 which , upon quantization , leads to a proton compton scattering cross section @xmath144.\\label{eq : sss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear from eq.([eq : sss ] ) that , from careful measurement of the differential scattering cross section , extraction of these structure dependent polarizability terms is possible provided that    * the energy is large enough that these terms are significant compared to the leading thomson piece and * that the energy is not so large that higher order corrections become important    and this has been accomplished recently at sal and mami , yielding@xcite @xmath145 a chiral one loop calculation has also been performed by bernard , kaiser , and meissner and yields a result in good agreement with these measurements@xcite @xmath146 the idea of _ generalized _ polarizability can be understood from the analogous venue of electron scattering wherein measurement of the charge form factor as a function of @xmath147 leads , when fourier transformed , to a picture of the _ local _ charge density within the system . in the same way the virtual compton scattering process@xmath148 can provide a measurement of the @xmath147-dependent electric and magnetic polarizabilities , whose fourier transform provides a picture of the _ local polarization density _ within the proton . on the theoretical side our group has performed a one loop hb@xmath0pt calculation and has produced a closed from expression for the predicted polarizabilities@xcite @xmath149 in the electric case the structure is about what would be expected  a gradual falloff of @xmath150 from the real photon point with scale @xmath151 . however , the magnetic generalized polarizability is predicted to _ rise _ before this general falloff occurs ",
    "chiral symmetry requires the presence of both a paramagnetic and a diamagnetic component to the proton .",
    "both predictions have received some support in a soon to be announced ( and tour de force ) mami measurement at @xmath152 mev@xcite . however , since parallel kinematics were employed in the experiment the desired generalized polarizabilities had to be identified on top of an enormous bethe - heitler background .",
    "a bates measurement , to be performed by the oops collaboration next spring , will take place at @xmath153 mev and will use the cababilities of the oops detector system to provide a 90 degree out of plane measurement , which will be _ much _ less sensitive to the bethe - heitler blowtorch .",
    "we anxiously await the results .",
    "above we have discussed some of the consequences of the feature that the @xmath154 chiral symmetry of qcd is broken spontaneously in the axial sector , implying the existence of eight pseudo - goldstone bosons which , because they are considerably lighter than the remaining hadronic spectrum , can be treated via an effective field theory ",
    "chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the predictions arising from such calculations are rigorous consequences of the underlying chiral symmetry of qcd and are subject to experimental tests using taps or other detectors at low energy machines .",
