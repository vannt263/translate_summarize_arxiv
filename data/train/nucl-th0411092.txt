    "the deuteron wave functions must be boosted from the deuteron rest frame to obtain the initial and final - state wave functions in the breit frame . the et formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite was not boost invariant , and this failure to respect poincar invariance resulted in an error at @xmath35 in the calculation of ref .",

    "we do not employ this `` exact boost '' construction because the electromagnetic currents that are obtained from the et reduction are not consistent with it . instead ,",
    "in our work we develop an approximate boost rule which maintains a clear correspondence to field theory , and so facilitates a more consistent treatment of strong and electromagnetic interactions .",

    "we include this pv - coupling current and find that it is significant , albeit not as important as when it is added in some nonrelativistic approaches  @xcite .",
    "the decreased importance of this effect in our approach is traceable to a factor of half in the pv - coupling current in the et formalism relative to the current used in ref .",
    "this factor must be taken into account if the unitary equivalence between different techniques for obtaining relativistic corrections to the @xmath28 interaction and currents is to be maintained  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 meson - exchange current ( mec ) has often been invoked in calculations of electron - deuteron scattering . in this mec",
    "the photon interacts with the @xmath42-meson cloud of one nucleon , producing a pion which is absorbed by the other nucleon .",
    "thus the @xmath43 interaction is of short range but the mec has long range because a pion exchange is involved .",
    "this mec contributes to @xmath12 at @xmath44 in the nuclear effective theory , but as we show it can produce substantial effects in the magnetic form factor at large @xmath45 .",
    "we include it in our relativistic calculation and consider the extent to which it can help to explain the magnetic form factor in the et formalism .",
    "although there is not much improvement in the description of data if the standard tensor @xmath10 coupling of one - boson - exchange @xmath28 models is adopted , other values of @xmath46 may help to explain @xmath47 .",
    "note that we do _ not _ include the @xmath48 current that has been considered by hummel and tjon @xcite because it is of shorter range .",
