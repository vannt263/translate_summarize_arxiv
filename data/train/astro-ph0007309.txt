    "an important component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in spiral galaxies is the diffuse ionized gas ( dig , also called wim for warm ionized medium ) .",
    "dig is a warm ( @xmath3 8000 k ) , diffuse ( n@xmath4=0.1@xmath50.2 @xmath6 ) layer of ionized hydrogen which permeates the disks of spiral galaxies ( see walterbos & braun 1996 for a review ) . in the milky way , where it is often referred to as the reynolds layer ,",
    "dig accounts for almost all of the ionized gas mass , contributes about 30% of the local hi column , and fills at least 20% of the volume of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "dig in several edge - on galaxies has been studied through h@xmath0  imaging @xcite , and the extent and brightness of halo dig has been found to vary dramatically . in face - on galaxies ,",
    "however , the most surprising discovery has been the _ similarity _ of the dig content among galaxies spanning a large range of characteristics .",
    "the dig components of many non - edge - on galaxies have been studied : m31 @xcite , m33 @xcite , m51 and m81 @xcite , ngc 253 and ngc 300 @xcite , ngc 247 and ngc 7793 @xcite , and m101 @xcite . despite the range of parameters seen in these galaxies ,",
    "the contribution of the dig to the total h@xmath0  luminosity ( the _ diffuse fraction _ ) is consistently between 30 and 50% .",
    "this is essentially a comparison of the dig luminosity and the hii region luminosity , so the constant ratio establishes a link between the dig and massive star formation .",
    "photoionization by massive stars and shock ionization by supernovae have both been proposed as ionization sources of the dig .",
    "all other sources have been found to lack by far the required energy @xcite , although @xcite finds that cosmic ray ionizations may be a somewhat more significant source than previously thought .",
    "the consistent diffuse fraction of 30 to 50% of the total h@xmath0  luminosity implies that a similar fraction of the ionizing photons produced in a galaxy is required to power the dig , if photoionization is responsible for the dig .",
    "the diffuse fraction for m33 is 40% @xcite , which leads to a minimum energy requirement ( assuming all ionizing photons have @xmath7=912   ) for the dig of 1.8@xmath810@xmath9 erg s@xmath10 , or 1.7@xmath810@xmath11 erg s@xmath10 @xmath12 of disk , using a radius of 6 kpc for m33 .",
    "this can be compared to 1.0@xmath810@xmath13 erg s@xmath10 and 1@xmath810@xmath11 erg s@xmath10 @xmath12 for the milky way , using a radius of 15 kpc , which just equals the amount of energy provided by supernovae @xcite . in m33",
    "the supernova rate is 1/360 years @xcite , which leads to 0.9@xmath810@xmath9 erg s@xmath10 , using the canonical 10@xmath14 erg for each supernova .",
    "this is a factor of 2 too low to account for the dig , even assuming an unrealistic 100% efficiency in converting the energy into ionized gas .",
    "also , the h@xmath0  luminosity used here has not been corrected for internal extinction , which would make the power requirement even higher .",
    "although some dig may be shock ionized , supernovae can not be the source of energy responsible for the bulk of the ionization of the dig in m33 or the milky way , through shock ionization or any other source which taps supernovae energy , such as turbulent mixing layers @xcite .",
    "this leaves ob stars as the most likely source .",
    "photoionization is consistent for the most part with spectroscopic observations of the dig .",
    "emission from [ sii ] 6716 , 6731   and [ nii ] 6548 , 6584   is enhanced relative to h@xmath0  in the dig when compared to hii regions , and [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007   is fainter relative to h@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this spectrum has been reproduced by photoionization models @xcite using a dilute radiation field in a diffuse medium .",
    "low limits on hei 5876 / h@xmath0  in the milky way @xcite have yet to be explained , and in ngc 891 the hei / h@xmath0  ratio , while higher than in the milky way , is still too low to be consistent with other line ratios @xcite . in m31 , however , the hei emission is consistent with the domgorgen & mathis models @xcite , at least for the brightest dig , and the hei / h@xmath0  ratio in several irregular galaxies is also consistent with photoionization @xcite .",
    "a more challenging problem has been posed by high [ oiii]/h@xmath15 ratios seen in the dig of several galaxies @xcite , which still have not been reproduced by pure photoionization models .",
    "nevertheless , the bulk of the evidence suggests that ob stars are the dominant ionization source for the dig .",
    "there is still uncertainty , however , regarding the location of the ob stars responsible for ionizing the dig .",
    "are the ionizing photons leaking out of density - bounded hii regions , or are there enough _ field ob stars _ to provide the ionizing photons ? either option is a deviation from commonly held views of the ism .",
    "if field stars are the dominant source of ionizing photons , this requires a substantial population of massive stars outside of hii regions .",
    "do these stars form in the field , do they manage to drift out of the cloud in which they formed , or is the gas swept away by the supernovae of even more massive stars ? on the other hand , if the photons which are ionizing the dig are leaking out of hii regions , an appreciable population of density - bounded hii regions is required .",
    "hii regions are usually treated as being radiation - bounded , which makes the determination of star formation rates from h@xmath0  luminosities straightforward .",
    "does such a population of leaky hii regions exist ?",
    "evidence for field ob stars does exist @xcite .",
    "@xcite defined field stars as those further from an hii region than a star could travel in the lifetime of an ob star ( @xmath16 10@xmath17 years ) , a few tens of parsecs at most . using ground - based ubv photometry , @xcite investigated the distribution of ob stars in m33 .",
    "they concluded that 50% of the ionizing stars were found outside of hii regions .",
    "such a study is difficult using ground - based optical data , where both crowding and the color degeneracy of hot stars pose serious problems .",
    "a systematic search for field ob stars is needed , and space based photometry in the ultraviolet can provide a strong test of the optical results .",
    "the alternative to field ob stars is a significant population of density - bounded hii regions .",
    "individual hii regions which are density - bounded do exist , such as the orion nebula @xcite and the starburst in ngc 4214 @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared the h@xmath0  luminosities of several hii regions in the lmc with the predicted ionizing fluxes of the stars within .",
    "they found 2 out of 14 hii regions to be substantially leaking ionizing photons , and 3 others that were slightly leaky .",
    "the observed absence of lyman continuum radiation leaking from spirals @xcite suggests that such radiation is contained within hii regions , although it is conceivable that hii regions are just leaky enough to ionize the dig , but not so much that an appreciable number of ionizing photons escapes the entire galaxy @xcite .",
    "there is evidence from the h@xmath0  luminosity functions of hii regions in spirals that high luminosity hii regions may be density - bounded @xcite .",
    "here we focus on identifying the stars responsible for ionizing the dig . in order to isolate massive stars we turn to the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) , where ob stars dominate the stellar emission .",
    "the local group spiral m33 is an ideal galaxy to study the ionization of the dig , due to its low inclination , vigorous star formation rate , and distance of only 0.84 mpc @xcite . in section 2",
    "we discuss the data used to carry out this project , which include h@xmath0  imaging of m33 , fuv imaging using the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) , and optical and fuv stellar photometry from the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) . in section 3",
    "we briefly review the properties of the dig in m33 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the fuv emission on large scales from the uit image and its relation to the h@xmath0  emission from both dig and hii regions . in section 5",
    "we present the results of the stellar photometry in hii regions and dig . in section 6",
    "we compare the fuv information from hst and uit .",
    "section 7 contains a discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "table 1 contains a summary of the observations .",
    "the ground - based data consist of h@xmath0 and off - band continuum images of m33 obtained with the 0.6 meter burrell - schmidt telescope at kitt peak national observatory in november 1995 @xcite .",
    "the 2048@xmath18 detector provided a field of view of 1.15@xmath81.15 degrees@xmath18 at 2.028@xmath19/pixel .",
    "the images were offset using the shift - and - stare technique to minimize flat - field irregularities .",
    "the final mosaic covers an area of about 1.75@xmath81.75 degrees@xmath18 .",
    "we reduced the images using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "twilight flats from all nights of the observing run were co - added to create a `` super flat '' which was used to correct for gain variations .",
    "we calibrated the continuum image using the published r magnitude and the known shape and transmission of the continuum filter .",
    "the h@xmath0 image was calibrated relative to the continuum , again using the shape and transmission of the line filters .",
    "the continuum image was scaled to the h@xmath0 image using foreground stars and subtracted .",
    "the total h@xmath0 flux we observed is 3.6 @xmath8 10@xmath20 ergs s@xmath10 @xmath12 .",
    "spectroscopy of dig and hii regions in m33 ( hoopes & walterbos 2000 , in preparation ) shows that [ nii ] 6584   emission is about 20% as strong as h@xmath0  in both the dig and hii regions .",
    "the lack of [ nii ] enhancement in the dig and the lower ratios in both environments than seen in other galaxies are probably due to a lower nitrogen abundance in m33 @xcite .",
    "the result is that at most only 5% of the light detected in the h@xmath0  filter can arise from [ nii ] emission , and the amount of contamination is the same for both hii regions and dig .",
    "the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0  image is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we obtained an archival uit image of m33 taken on the _ astro-1 _ space shuttle mission @xcite .",
    "we used the fuv image , a 424 second exposure taken through the b1 filter ( @xmath7=1520 , @xmath21=354 ) .",
    "the image was originally produced on film and later digitized .",
    "the resolution of the image is about 3@xmath19and the field of view is roughly 40@xmath22 .",
    "the h@xmath0  image was convolved to similar resolution and put on the same grid .",
    "uit was calibrated in the laboratory before launch and also in flight by comparing uit images with previous uv space missions .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is about 15% @xcite .",
    "the uit image can be found in @xcite .",
    "lastly , we used archival hst wfpc2 images of regions in m33 , from project go6038 .",
    "these images were originally obtained to study hot stars and star clusters in m33 @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows that the pointings are restricted to the inner @xmath23 radius of m33 , but all of the pointings contain hii regions and dig .",
    "the pointings near the center cover regions that are more crowded than those covered in the pointings at larger radii .",
    "spiral arms and inter - arm regions are both sampled .",
    "the only obvious bias introduced by the locations of the images is that they do not include the brightest hii regions in m33 .",
    "the filters and exposure times are f170w ( 2@xmath8900 s ) , f336w ( 2@xmath8900 s ) , f439w(600 s ) and f555w(160 s ) .",
    "the two separate exposures in the uv and fuv filters were combined to remove cosmic rays .",
    "the images were corrected for the @xmath3 4% charge transfer efficiency problem of the wfpc2 by multiplying with a ramp image as described by @xcite .",
    "the f170w and f336w images were also corrected for degradation of throughput after decontamination , again using the formula in @xcite .",
    "photometry was performed on the hst images using the daophot package . for each frame ,",
    "a psf model was created using bright , isolated stars .",
    "the empirical psf model was found using an iterative process .",
    "a constant psf model was first computed and used to subtract the neighbors of the psf stars .",
    "then a linearly varying psf model was computed on the image with the psf neighbors subtracted , and then used to remove the psf neighbors from the original image . finally a quadratically varying model was computed from the psf stars with the neighbors subtracted .",
    "if there were few psf stars ( less than about 15 , which was usually the case in the f170w images ) a constant psf model was used .",
    "it was also created iteratively , first making a model psf , then subtracting any neighbors of the psf stars and revising the psf based on the subtracted image .",
    "we compiled a list of stars detected in all four bands .",
    "the magnitudes were put on the stmag photometric system , described by @xcite , using the most recently determined calibration for wfpc2 .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is 1@xmath52% in the optical filters , and around 10% in the f170 filter .",
    "the h@xmath0  mosaic of m33 is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we briefly repeat the relevant results here .",
    "the diffuse fraction of m33 was found to be 40% , in good agreement with all other non - edge - on spirals studied so far .",
    "the schmidt image reveals the dig to be a complex network of filaments and arcs , superimposed upon a fainter , more diffuse background . as in other spirals",
    ", dig is concentrated in regions of high star formation , and in the inner disk , but it is much more extended than the star forming regions , filling the disk with faint h@xmath0  emission .",
    "narrow - band imaging of the dig in m33 @xcite reveals that it shows the same spectral signature of enhanced [ sii ] seen in other galaxies .",
    "the fuv / h@xmath0  ratio in the dig can constrain the source of ionization . for example , if the measured ratio in the dig did not correspond to any reasonable average spectral type or population of ionizing stars , we would conclude that the ionizing photons in the dig are not produced locally . to perform this test we measured the fuv flux ( l@xmath25 ) in the uit image and the h@xmath0  flux in the schmidt image . for hii regions , we defined an aperture and a background annulus on the h@xmath0  image , and then used the same aperture and annulus on the fuv image . for dig , we measured the fluxes in 500 pc @xmath8 500 pc square apertures ( in the plane of the sky ) , with the hii regions masked out .",
    "the hii region mask was defined on the h@xmath0  image and applied to both the h@xmath0  and fuv images .",
    "this is slightly different from the approach taken in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the fluxes were measured in smaller apertures , leading to the possibility that in hii regions an aperture may miss the concentrated cluster of ob stars while still containing h@xmath0  emission , leading to very high h@xmath0  /l@xmath25 ratios and thereby increasing the scatter in the distribution of ratios . also in that paper no background was subtracted from the hii regions , contrary to the approach taken here .",
    "the background subtraction typically affects the h@xmath0  flux of the hii regions by only 1@xmath52% , but in the fuv image the contrast between hii regions and the field is not as high as in h@xmath0 , and the background subtraction can reduce the fuv flux by as much as 50% , and even more for faint hii regions .",
    "we computed the number of ionizing photons ( n@xmath1 ) from the h@xmath0  luminosity , assuming ionization equilibrium and case b recombination @xcite and neglecting absorption of ionizing photons by dust .",
    "the histograms in figure 2 show the resulting distribution of n@xmath1/l@xmath25 ratios for the two environments .",
    "the histograms are shown sideways for comparison with models ( see below ) .",
    "the observed ratios are shown ; they have not been corrected for foreground or internal extinction .",
    "the n@xmath1/l@xmath25 ratio in dig is lower than that in hii regions .",
    "this fits a scenario in which the ionizing stars in the dig are of later type than those in hii regions , since the later type stars would produce a lower ratio of ionizing to non - ionizing uv photons .    in figure 2",
    "we compare the n@xmath1/l@xmath25 ratios with models of evolving stellar populations .",
    "we used the starburst99 evolutionary model to compute the ratio of ionizing photons to fuv flux @xcite .",
    "the model used a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) with an upper mass cutoff of 120 @xmath26 .",
    "lmc - like ( z=0.008 ) metallicity models were calculated .",
    "the metallicity of m33 in the central region is about solar , but there is a steep gradient towards lower metallicity with distance from the center @xcite , so that overall m33 is subsolar in metallicity .",
    "single burst and steady state models are presented .",
    "the reddening bars shown indicate the direction that the _ models _ would move if reddened by the given amount .",
    "both the lmc @xcite and galactic @xcite extinction laws are given , and the case of a foreground screen and a uniform mixture of dust and gas are shown for each extinction law .",
    "@xcite found an average color excess of e(b - v)=0.16 in several fields of m33 .",
    "the galactic foreground produces a color excess of e(b - v)=0.03@xmath20.02 at this location @xcite , and the rest is internal to m33 .",
    "the extinction in the @xcite ) fields ranges from e(b - v)=0.09 to 0.33 .",
    "we also show reddened versions of each model . the steady state model , which represents the population expected outside of hii regions ,",
    "was reddened by e(b - v)=0.1 , while the single burst model , which represents the population in an hii region , was reddened by e(b - v)=0.2 , all using the lmc extinction law .",
    "the dashed line is reddened assuming a uniform mixture , and the dotted line is reddened assuming a foreground screen .",
    "each reddened model also includes e(b - v)=0.03 of foreground galactic reddening , using the galactic extinction law .",
    "the dig distribution is consistent with an older burst population , or with a steady state , constant star formation model .",
    "the steady state model is probably a more accurate description of the stellar population in the dig , but it is only an approximation .",
    "figure 2 also shows the predictions of the steady state model using steeper imf slopes than the usual salpeter slope of @xmath0=@xmath52.35 .",
    "although the predicted ratios are below the observed ratio , with a reasonable amount of extinction the prediction for @xmath0=@xmath53.0 would match the observed dig values well .",
    "this is interesting in light of the fact that @xcite found a steeper imf slope for ob stars in the field in the lmc and smc .",
    "we will explore this issue further in section 6 .",
    "the hii regions resemble a young burst population .",
    "the model values are dependent on the assumed imf , and in small hii regions ( which are the most numerous ) that have low numbers of massive stars , the ionizing flux of a single o star may dominate the light from the uv emitting b stars .",
    "figure 3 shows the same histograms along with the expected ratios from ionizing stars , taken from the costar stellar models @xcite .",
    "we show models using low metallicity ( z=0.004 ) and solar metallicity ( z=0.020 ) , to cover the extreme values . again",
    "the dig ratio can be explained by later type ionizing stars .",
    "the n@xmath1/l@xmath25 ratio in the dig can be explained with a local ionization model , where the ionizing population in the dig is older than that in hii regions .",
    "however , the uit analysis is far from conclusive .",
    "the ionizing photons which produce the h@xmath0  emission seen in the dig may be produced elsewhere and then leak into the dig , as in the leaky hii regions explanation for the ionization of the dig . in this case",
    "the models in figure 2 and 3 would not apply . to test this more conclusively , we need to find out whether the ionizing photons are produced locally .",
    "we investigate this further in the next section .",
    "if the difference in the fuv / h@xmath0  ratio between dig and hii regions were due to higher extinction in the hii regions , at least 0.9 magnitudes a@xmath27 in excess of that in the dig would be necessary to explain the result using a foreground screen model , and much higher for a uniform mixture .",
    "@xcite found , on average , a 0.3 magnitude difference in extinction between hii regions and dig in m31 .",
    "our stellar photometry ( see the next section ) indicates that there is on average little difference in the amount of extinction in the two environments .",
    "however , this is for only a very small part of the disk , so to be consistent with @xcite we reddened the burst models more than the steady state models in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the most conclusive test of whether field stars can ionize the dig would be to find the spectral types of all the ob stars outside of hii regions , add up the number of ionizing photons contributed by each star , and compare the total to that required by the h@xmath0  luminosity of the dig . @xcite and @xcite have shown that optical photometry is unable to distinguish between the different spectral types of ionizing stars , a distinction that must be made if accurate lyman continuum luminosities are to be determined .",
    "this is because the peak of the planck spectrum lies blueward of these filters for stars of 30,000 k or hotter , so optical filters sample the rayleigh - jeans portion of the spectrum which has a constant slope independent of temperature .",
    "spectroscopy is the most reliable way to determine spectral types of massive stars , but obtaining spectroscopy of a large sample of field stars in m33 would require a prohibitive amount of telescope time .",
    "however , fuv photometry combined with optical photometry can be used to estimate spectral types of ionizing stars with reasonable accuracy .",
    "the f170w is closer to the peak of the planck spectrum for temperatures above 30,000 k , providing an advantage over optical photometry alone .",
    "the archival hst images cover dig of varying brightness ( see overlay of figure 1 ) .",
    "however , they do not overlap any very luminous hii regions , only moderate and low - luminosity hii regions .",
    "this is a limitation of the data , and it prevents us from investigating whether the brightest hii regions are density - bounded . it should be noted that the hst images cover a much smaller area of the disk of m33 than the uit image , so the focus of the analysis shifts here from a global to a local perspective .",
    "the hst pointings are all located in the inner disk of m33 , within 10@xmath28 from the nucleus , where the metallicity is close to solar @xcite .",
    "for this reason we assume solar metallicity when employing stellar models in the analysis of the wfpc2 images .",
    "we put the h@xmath0  image of m33 on the same grid as the wfpc2 frames , and then classified the stars in the wfpc2 images as being either in an hii region or in the field based on the h@xmath0  surface brightness .",
    "an isophotal cut was used , but the level was adjusted to satisfactorily isolate the two environments based on their morphology . in the inner disk",
    "the cut level is as high as 200 pc @xmath29 , while in the outer disk it is as low as 60 pc @xmath29 .",
    "individual hii regions were then picked from the masked image by eye .",
    "the rest of the image was counted as dig .",
    "only the wide field images were used , as there were no complete hii regions in the planetary camera images , and they do not cover a large enough area of dig to analyze .",
    "@xcite caution that the response curves of the main photometric filters used with wfpc2 ( f336w , f439w , f555w ) , are sufficiently different from the groundbased analogs ( ubv ) , that any reddening correction must be applied to the photometry in the hst filter system .",
    "thus we derived reddening relations for the hst filter system used in this project , rather than transform the photometry to the groundbased system .",
    "we used the model stellar spectra of @xcite , and reddened them according to both the galactic extinction law @xcite and the lmc law @xcite .",
    "we used the @xcite model spectra rather than the costar models used below because the lejeune _",
    "_  models extend to spectral types later than b0 , allowing more of the unevolved main sequence to be used in determining the extinction .",
    "the reddened spectra were multiplied by the hst filter response curves to obtain the magnitude .",
    "the derived relations agree with those found in @xcite , although the f170w relation was not given .",
    "we found that the lmc extinction law worked more satisfactorily than the galactic law for reddening all bands to match the observed colors .",
    "as before , the reddening includes a correction for e(b - v)=0.03 foreground reddening using the galactic extinction law , and any excess reddening using the lmc extinction law .",
    "figure 4 shows representative color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for hii regions and dig regions in m33 .",
    "isochrones of ages 0 and 7@xmath30 years are also shown .",
    "the isochrones were generated using the geneva stellar evolution models @xcite . in order to put the isochrones in the stmag system , for each stellar mass at each age we found the closest match in t@xmath31 and @xmath32 in the model stellar spectra of @xcite .",
    "the spectrum was then multiplied by the wfpc2 filter response curves to derive the observed magnitude .",
    "the isochrones are shown for reference only , they are not the best fit to the cmd . the purpose of these isochrones was to determine the extinction for each region .",
    "the amount of extinction needed to match the observed main sequence with the isochrone is taken as the average extinction for that region .",
    "the same was done for the remaining stars not in hii regions , which are field stars in the dig .",
    "using a single value for extinction in either environment is obviously an over - simplification , but it is the best solution for the available data .",
    "the average extinction found in hii regions was e(b - v)=0.14 , and in dig it was e(b - v)=0.13 .",
    "we estimate that the extinction can be determined with this method with a 1-@xmath33 accuracy of e(b - v)= @xmath20.02 .",
    "we assigned spectral types based on the costar models of @xcite .",
    "they provide spectral energy distributions for stars of mass 20 , 25 , 40 , 60 , 85 , and 120 m@xmath34 at various ages in the @xcite database .",
    "we used the solar metallicity ( z=0.020 ) models to match the metallicity where the hst pointings are located .",
    "we ran the model spectra through the hst filters , and linearly interpolated the magnitudes and other stellar properties ( _ e.g. _   temperature , surface gravity , and ionizing photon luminosity ) to the ages and masses between those given , to create a complete grid with 1 m@xmath34 mass resolution and 10@xmath35 year time resolution .",
    "we then searched for the nearest match to the four magnitudes measured for each star .",
    "thus for each star we go directly from the measured photometry to ionizing luminosity .",
    "the uncertainty in the ionizing luminosity is determined by the uncertainty in the photometry , ignoring uncertainty in the accuracy of the models , which is difficult to quantify .",
    "we then inspected the color magnitude diagrams and the positions of the stars that were classified , noting any uv - bright stars that were not classified . in order to classify these stars , we adjusted the tolerance for the f555w magnitude , and if necessary for the f439w magnitude as well . in most cases the tolerance",
    "was increased to 2-@xmath33 , and in a few cases , 3-@xmath33 .",
    "a small number of stars were in crowded regions and obviously had mismatched f555w and f439w magnitudes ( crowding usually does not affect the uv magnitudes since fewer stars show up in the uv images ) , so we used only f170w and f336w magnitudes for classification .",
    "most stars were matched within 1-@xmath33 of the four measured magnitudes .",
    "we compared our photometric spectral types to previous spectroscopic spectral types to assess the accuracy of the photometric technique .",
    "we looked for overlapping stars in @xcite and @xcite , finding only two stars that overlap , both in @xcite .",
    "the reason is that our technique only assigns spectral types to b0 stars and earlier , so while many b stars overlapped , we did not assign spectral types to them , so they could not be used for comparison .",
    "the properties that the photometric technique assigned to the two stars are shown in table 2 , along with the properties of the spectral type assigned by @xcite .",
    "these properties are taken from @xcite .",
    "the properties that the photometric technique assigned to both stars match reasonably well with the properties expected for stars of the correct spectral type .",
    "it should be noted that uit104 is a wolf - rayet star , and might not be expected to match the properties of an o9ia star .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement gives us reason to believe that the photometrically determined spectral types agree with those determined spectroscopically , to within about a spectral type .      for each hii region",
    "we summed the predicted ionizing luminosity of all the stars included in the region .",
    "the predicted ionizing luminosity in the dig was the cumulative luminosity of stars not included in an hii region .",
    "each chip of each wfpc2 pointing was considered separately .",
    "we converted the predicted ionizing luminosity to a predicted h@xmath0  luminosity l@xmath36 , assuming that all ionizing photons result in an ionization ( _ i.e. _  no dust absorption ) and case b recombination .",
    "the predicted l@xmath36   was then compared to the observed l@xmath36 .",
    "we measured the observed l@xmath36   from the h@xmath0  image ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the boundaries of the hii regions were determined on the masked image , and a background correction for the surrounding dig was subtracted .",
    "hii regions which were not completely contained within the hst pointing were not considered .",
    "the l@xmath36   for dig was the sum of all the luminosity not in an hii region .",
    "the luminosities were corrected for extinction using the estimates of e(b - v ) from the color - magnitude diagrams .    in figure 5",
    "we compare the predicted l@xmath36 , based on the ionizing luminosity of the stars present , with the observed l@xmath36   from the h@xmath0  image for both hii regions and dig .",
    "the errors reflect a combination of uncertainty in photometry and in extinction .",
    "the effect of photometric errors on the ionizing luminosity was calculated by determining for each star the model with the highest n@xmath1 and the model with the lowest n@xmath1 that still matched within the photometric errors . when the best match luminosities were added for all stars in the region , the range found for each star",
    "was added in quadrature .",
    "the effects of uncertainty in extinction were quantified by varying the correction by e(b - v)=@xmath20.02 , and again calculating the total ionizing luminosity of the stars in a region .",
    "these two uncertainties were added together in quadrature to produce the error bars shown in figure 5 .",
    "qualitatively , we find that the measured l@xmath36   for both hii regions and dig agree well with the predicted luminosities .",
    "there is considerable scatter , but given the uncertainties in stellar models , extinction in the uv , and spectral classification without the use of spectra , the agreement is encouraging .",
    "the observed l@xmath36   is corrected for extinction , but the predicted l@xmath36   may be an overestimate since we ignore the possibility of ionizing photons being absorbed by dust . to correct for this",
    "we would have to know how much of the ionizing luminosity of a star is absorbed by dust .",
    "@xcite estimate the fraction of dust absorbed in galactic hii regions to be about 25% , perhaps slightly lower for smaller hii regions such as those we consider here .",
    "figure 5 shows that while the mean ratio is close to unity , some hii regions are under - predicted or over predicted .",
    "this is an indication that predictions for individual regions are not reliable , but that the average for all the regions is better .",
    "thus a comparison of the average values for dig and hii regions is more illuminating than individual regions .",
    "the average ratio of predicted to required l@xmath36   are given in table 3 . for hii regions the predictions are consistent with the observed l@xmath36 . for dig regions",
    "there are not enough ionizing photons emitted by field stars to account for all of the observed h@xmath0  emission , but there are enough to provide a significant fraction of the ionization , about 40% .",
    "to test the idea that fuv information is necessary to estimate the spectral types of ionizing stars , we re - classified the ionizing stars using only the f336w , f439w , and f555w magnitudes .",
    "the results are given in table 3 .",
    "the predicted l@xmath36   is higher , and most hii regions are overpredicted , leading to a large excess of ionizing photons .",
    "if the fuv information had been ignored in the initial classification , many non - ionizing stars would have been classified as ionizing stars , leading to a further excess .",
    "the fuv information is crucial to accurately predict ionizing fluxes , and optical information alone will lead to a severe over prediction of ionizing fluxes of ob stars .",
    "this test underscores the difficulty of drawing conclusions about ob stars based on optical photometry ( patel & wilson 1995 , see also odell , hodge , & kennicutt 1999 ) .",
    "this may account for the discrepancy in the fraction of ob stars found outside of hii regions .",
    "we identified 116 ionizing stars in the five wfpc fields .",
    "of these , 27% ( 31 stars ) were in the dig , lower than the @xmath350% found by @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to remember that we can only investigate a small fraction of the disk of m33 with the present hst data .",
    "@xcite found that 2 out of 14 hii regions in the lmc are leaking a sizeable number of ionizing photons .",
    "these two hii regions both have a ring - like morphology , leading to the question of whether hii morphology is correlated the amount of leakage .",
    "this is an important question in light of suggestions that ionizing photons escaping from superbubbles may be an important ionization source @xcite .",
    "softening of the spectrum by re - radiation of ionizing photons through chimney walls may explain the low hei measurements @xcite .",
    "we classified the hii regions in the hst field based on their morphology in the h@xmath0  image , in order to look for trends in the amount of leakage with morphology .",
    "figure 6 shows this comparison .",
    "the hii regions are either compact , meaning center brightened and obviously discrete , or diffuse , which includes rings , filaments , and faint tenuous hii regions ( the ring - like hii regions are shown as double open circles ) .",
    "it appears that compact and diffuse hii regions are equally likely to be density - bounded .    in figure 6",
    "we also see that there is no significant trend for leakiness with l@xmath36 .",
    "it is very important to remember that the brightest hii regions in m33 were not imaged in the hst data , and only a few in our sample are more luminous than 10@xmath37 erg s@xmath10 ( corrected for internal extinction ) .",
    "thus we can not address the issue of whether the most luminous hii regions are density - bounded @xcite .",
    "it is still interesting , however , that the two brightest hii regions in m33 , ngc 604 @xcite and ngc 595 @xcite , appear to be radiation - bounded . in a future paper",
    "we will investigate the brightest hii regions in m33 .",
    "the wfpc2 images resolve stars above a limiting magnitude , which in the f170w filter corresponds to about a b0 star .",
    "the uit image measures all of the fuv surface brightness of the entire population of uv emitting stars .",
    "the uit image sensitivity extends to 50 - 100 myr old populations @xcite , which corresponds to b and early a type stars , so a comparison of the uv flux measured by hst and uit thus compares the stars of spectral type b0 and earlier to the entire oba population .",
    "this is an age dependent ratio which can be modeled , and may be used to further characterize the stellar population in both hii regions and dig .",
    "the attractive feature of this comparison is that it is largely independent of extinction , as both filters cover a similar range of wavelengths ( however extinction must still be incorporated , see below ) .",
    "we have performed this comparison for the hii regions and dig on the hst fields .",
    "the fuv flux from the uit image was measured using the same apertures used to measure the h@xmath0  flux .",
    "we then summed up the fuv flux of the stars brighter than a magnitude limit in the same regions in the hst images . in order to keep a consistent limiting magnitude ,",
    "we reddened the f170w magnitude of a b0 star ( m@xmath38=16.92 ) using the extinction found from the cmds and used throughout this analysis , and summed the flux from all stars brighter than this magnitude .",
    "this is the point where extinction becomes important in this comparison , the determination of the cutoff magnitude in the hst images .",
    "the relationship between flux and magnitude in the stmag system is given by @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the flux was determined from the magnitudes _ without _ correcting for extinction , as the uit flux is also uncorrected .",
    "the extinction is only used to determine the cutoff magnitude which corresponds to a b0 star .",
    "a histogram of the ratios is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the histogram shows a difference between the two populations , with dig having a lower ratio of hst to uit flux .",
    "this is expected if the dig is ionized by an older population , with fewer stars earlier than b0 relative the number of stars later than b0 . also shown on the plot are models of the evolution of this ratio through time , constructed using starburst99 @xcite .",
    "the uit flux was modeled as an evolving population with a mass range from 1 to 120 m@xmath40 , a @xcite imf , and solar metallicity . in order to simulate the populations seen in the hst fuv images",
    ", we needed to include flux only from stars with m@xmath4120m@xmath40 , as this corresponds to the limiting spectral type of b0 in the hst images . to do this",
    "we ran the models again , except that mass range was 20 to 120 m@xmath40 , and the total mass was scaled down by 0.2 ( so that the total mass , including stars with m@xmath4220m@xmath40 , was 10@xmath43m@xmath40 , as it was for the uit simulation ) .",
    "this approach is simplistic , but provides a first - order model for comparison with the observations .",
    "as expected , the ratio of hst to uit flux in the single burst model generally decreases as time passes and the most massive stars die .",
    "the observed ratios for hii regions match well with the predicted values for single burst populations .",
    "an older burst model reproduces the dig ratios reasonably well .",
    "we also ran steady state models as described above , but the resulting ratio did not agree well with the observed ratio for the dig , contrary to the analysis in figure 2 . the disagreement may indicate that if the steady state model is an accurate description of the stellar population in the dig , the parameters used for the hii region stars may not apply to the field stars . specifically , @xcite derived the imf for field stars in the lmc and smc , and found a slope ranging from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ( in the notation where the salpeter imf slope @xmath0 is @xmath46 ) .",
    "we ran models using imf slopes for massive stars ( m@xmath4120m@xmath40 ) of @xmath0=@xmath47 , and the standard salpeter slope of @xmath52.35 , while keeping the slope for less massive stars at @xmath0=@xmath46 .",
    "the observed hst / uit flux ratio agrees much better with the models using a steeper slope of @xmath0=@xmath48 than the salpeter slope .",
    "this supports the conclusions of @xcite regarding the imf slope for field ob stars .",
    "the observed ratios suggest that the imf slope for field ob stars in m33 is not as steep as that in the lmc and smc , but is still steeper than the imf in hii regions .",
    "it should be noted that the starburst99 models are intended for starburst regions , _",
    "i.e. _  regions with a large number of stars .",
    "most of the hii regions we are investigating do not fit into this category , so the model can not be expected to accurately predict the observed ratio .",
    "the main problem is that with small numbers of massive stars , the imf is not well sampled .",
    "this may be the reason behind the spread in the observed distribution of hst / uit ratios , and also might explain why some hii regions have ratios too high to be explained by the models",
    ". however , the predicted ratio agrees with the majority of hii regions , which suggests that these deviations average out for a large number of hii regions .",
    "also note that the two filters are not identical , and this is probably the reason some of the hii regions have hst / uit @xmath491 .",
    "our most important result is that the ob stars outside of hii regions can account for 40% of the ionization of the dig in m33 .",
    "there are several points to keep in mind .",
    "one is the scale we are investigating , which is constrained by the size of the wide field chips of wfpc2 , 325 pc across each chip .",
    "this means we are implicitly assuming that stars ( field stars in particular ) do not have an influence at distances greater than this , or that the number of photons escaping the image is balanced by the number of photons coming in from outside the image . in a uniform medium with n=0.2 @xmath6 , which is the density found for the dig in the galaxy , the strmgren sphere of an o3v star has a diameter of about 770 pc ( osterbrock 1989 , using the stellar ionizing flux in vacca _",
    "et al . _  1996",
    "however there are few of these stars outside of hii regions .",
    "one chip can completely contain the strmgren sphere of an o8v star , and a b0v star ionizes a region about 170pc across .",
    "the density in the dig in the inner regions of m33 may be higher than the density measured in the solar neighborhood , which would tend to make the ionized regions smaller . we can not account for neighboring hii regions or ionizing stars outside of the wfpc2 field of view .",
    "another point to consider is the many uncertainties dealt with in this analysis .",
    "when working in the uv extinction is always a prime concern , and small changes in the adopted extinction , or in the extinction law , can cause large changes in the ionizing luminosity .",
    "when dealing with individual stars in external galaxies , crowding can often be a concern .",
    "the stars visible in the f170w filter are rarely crowded , but of course crowding may be present but not detectable , as in the case of binaries .",
    "crowding may also be a more severe problem for ob associations in hii regions than for the more sparsely distributed stars in the dig .",
    "another source of uncertainty stems from the stellar atmosphere models which we use to assign lyman continuum luminosities .",
    "the stellar models give excellent agreement for the non - ionizing spectrum of massive stars , but the ionizing spectrum is difficult to test without making assumptions .",
    "we have tried to be as conservative as possible in every aspect of this analysis . given these uncertainties ,",
    "it is remarkable that we find such good agreement between the predicted and observed l@xmath36 .",
    "this gives us confidence in the stellar models , and it also suggests that any mistakes we are making regarding the extinction and spectral classification are relatively small .",
    "it also suggests that we are detecting most , if not all , of the ionizing stars .    without placing trust in the absolute accuracy of the predicted ionizing fluxes , it is possible to draw conclusions by comparing our predictions for dig and hii regions",
    "this comparison relies on the assumption that any errors in the prediction for the dig will also be made for hii regions .",
    "the ratio of n@xmath1/l@xmath36   is lower in the dig than in hii regions , indicating that some leakage is necessary to explain the dig .",
    "however , the difference is not so great that field stars can be neglected as a source of ionization .",
    "the n@xmath1/l@xmath36   in the dig is about 37% of the ratio in hii regions .",
    "if we normalize the n@xmath1/l@xmath36   to 100% in hii regions , this relative approach would suggest that field stars can ionize at least 37% of the dig , well within the uncertainty of our absolute determination .    in the regions covered in the wfpc2 pointings , the fraction of the _ total _",
    "h@xmath0  luminosity that comes from the dig is 40% , which is also the diffuse fraction of the entire galaxy . in the five fields analyzed here , on average the field stars",
    "can account for 40%@xmath212% of the ionization of the dig ( it is a potentially confusing coincidence that these two numbers are the same ) .",
    "this implies that only 30% of the ionizing photons emitted in hii regions need to escape to account for the remaining dig , or put differently , the predicted l@xmath36   in hii regions should be 143% of the observed l@xmath36   in hii regions .",
    "the average ratio of predicted to observed l@xmath36   for hii regions is 107%@xmath226% , so the amount of excess ionizing photons is not enough to explain all of the remaining dig , with the maximum within the uncertainty being 133% .",
    "simply adding up the observed and predicted l@xmath36 , we find that , within the uncertainty , 98% of the total observed l@xmath36   ( dig+hii ) can be explained by field stars plus leakage ( taking the maximum predicted n@xmath1 within the uncertainty ) .",
    "also keep in mind that other processes may play some role in ionizing the dig , such as turbulent mixing layers @xcite and shock ionization .",
    "most likely a combination of these processes , plus photons leaking from hii regions , ionize the rest of the dig .",
    "there is also the possibility that a fraction of the ionizing photons are absorbed by dust .",
    "@xcite found that about 25% of the ionizing photons emitted by stars within hii regions are absorbed by dust .",
    "if this is the case , we then predict only 80% of the ionizing photons necessary to explain the l@xmath36   of the hii regions .",
    "since there is not even enough to explain the l@xmath36   from hii regions , we can not then explain the remaining dig ionization with leaky hii regions .",
    "however , since we know that the hii regions are ionized by the stars within , the discrepancy might be explained by a systematic error in determining the spectral types and ionizing luminosities from the photometry . in this case",
    "we could then scale the predicted hii region luminosity up to 100% , and scale up the predicted dig luminosity accordingly to perform a relative comparison .",
    "we could not address the question of whether any excess ionizing luminosity from stars in hii regions exists .",
    "if an equal fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by field ob stars is absorbed by dust , the results of this paper would not be greatly affected .",
    "taking the maximum predicted n@xmath1 within the uncertainty , we find that there are no ionizing photons from stars left over to escape the galaxy altogether .",
    "of course this depends on the contribution of other ionization sources to the dig .",
    "if 20% of the dig is ionized by another source , there can be as much as 4% of the stellar ionizing photons left over to escape the galaxy , within the error bars .",
    "the uncertainty in these numbers is such that we can not place much weight on this limit .",
    "however , it is in agreement with @xcite , who found that less than 3% of the ionizing photons escape from four starburst galaxies observed with hut , although @xcite suggest that the fraction could be as high as 57% for one of the galaxies by allowing for absorption by undetected components of the ism .",
    "@xcite also find very little leakage , less than 1%",
    ". we must also remember that we are restricted to relatively small regions ( about 650pc across ) , and are really covering only a small fraction of the disk of m33 .",
    "we have know way of knowing whether excess photons emitted by stars in the image actually escape the galaxy , or simply ionize gas outside of the image .",
    "similarly , there may be photons from outside of the image ionizing gas in the image .",
    "note that leaky hii regions can provide less than 60% of the ionization of the dig in the regions of m33 studied here .",
    "this is in disagreement with the results of @xcite , who found that the lyman continuum escaping from hii regions could very likely account for all of the dig emission in the lmc .",
    "this may point to a difference between the dig in irregular galaxies and spirals .",
    "@xcite found that helium is completely ionized in the dig in several irregular galaxies , indicating ionization by very massive stars , type o7 or hotter .",
    "they concluded that density - bounded hii regions are the dominant source of ionization in those galaxies .",
    "a difference in the ionization source might explain the lower hei 5876   / h@xmath0  seen in some spirals @xcite .",
    "the field ob stars in m33 appear to have a steeper imf than ob stars in hii regions , confirming the results of @xcite for field ob stars in the lmc and smc .",
    "the slope which best fits our observations is not as steep as that found in the lmc and smc , but it is still different from that found in hii regions . the difference may imply a different formation mechanism for field stars , but does not necessarily mean that they form in the field .",
    "field ob stars may have formed in an hii region and then drifted out of the dense cloud , or they may be the remnants of an ob association after the surrounding gas has dissipated through the actions of sne and stellar winds . in either case , lower mass ob stars are more likely to become field stars , as they have longer lives and thus can drift farther , or live long enough to outlast the hii region .",
    "the result would be a steeper mass function for field ob stars , because the youngest and most massive stars are still associated with hii regions . in this case",
    "the varying imf is used to simulate a steeper _ mass function _ for stars in the field , and it is not necessary that they have a different _ initial _ mass function .",
    "the steeper imf merely represents the fact that the most massive hii region stars have a smaller chance of becoming field stars due to their short lifetimes .",
    "however , @xcite carefully corrected for stars which may have drifted out of hii regions , and found stars as massive as 85 m@xmath34 in the field .",
    "it is difficult to explain how a star this massive became a field star if it did not form in the field .",
