    "mapping out the qcd phase diagram is one of the basic goals of lattice qcd calculations at non - zero temperature .",
    "it was noted by pisarski and wilczek that the order of the chiral phase transition in qcd may depend on the number of light quark degrees of freedom and qualitative features of the transition may also change with the quark mass @xcite . in qcd with 3 massless quark flavors the chiral phase transition is expected to be first order .",
    "if this is the case , the phase transition remains first order even for non - zero values of the quark masses and terminates at a critical quark mass @xmath3 , or equivalently at a critical pion mass , @xmath4 , where the transition becomes second order belonging to the 3-d z(2 ) ising universality class .",
    "for quark mass @xmath5 chiral restoration takes place through a smooth crossover .",
    "knowledge about the phase structure in the light - strange quark mass plane at vanishing chemical potential also impacts our understanding regarding its extension to non - zero chemical potential . for zero chemical potential ,",
    "the values of critical quark masses characterize a line of chiral phase transitions in the light - strange quark mass plane .",
    "this line extends toward the non - zero chemical potential direction and forms a surface of phase transitions in the 3-d , z(2 ) universality class .",
    "the chemical potential where this surface intersects the physical values of light and strange quark masses may correspond to the qcd critical point @xcite .",
    "however , determining the curvature of this surface turns out to be complicated @xcite and , in fact , is likely to suffer from similar lattice cut - off effects as those contributing to the value of the critical pion mass itself .",
    "the first order chiral phase transition in 3flavor qcd has been investigated on coarse lattices using unimproved  @xcite as well as improved actions  @xcite . however , on these coarse lattices the critical pion mass value turns out to be strongly cut - off and regularization scheme dependent . as of now",
    "no continuum extrapolated results exist .",
    "current results for the critical pion mass obtained in calculations with staggered ( standard and p4fat3 ) fermions on @xmath6 and 6 lattices vary from about 300 mev down to about 70 mev  @xcite . while studies using the clover improved wilson fermion action on @xmath7 , 6 , 8 and 10",
    "lattices suggest that @xmath4 can change from about 750 mev to about 100 mev  @xcite . in general it",
    "is found that the critical pion mass decreases when using either improved actions or when reducing the lattice spacing .",
    "in addition to studies concerning @xmath8=3 , lattice qcd calculations searching for first order chiral phase transitions in other cases have also been carried out .",
    "studies on @xmath8=2 qcd using standard staggered fermions  @xcite and unimproved wilson fermions  @xcite on @xmath7 lattices suggest that @xmath4 is nonzero and could be around 560 mev .",

    "it has been noted previously that the estimate of the critical pion mass @xmath4 from lattice qcd calculations strongly depends on lattice cutoff effects . in order to reach a better understanding of the first order chiral phase transition region we use here the hisq action  @xcite . at a given value of the lattice spacing",
    "the hisq action achieves better taste symmetry than the asqtad , p4 and 2stout actions , which previously have been used for the analysis of the phase structure of 3-flavor qcd  @xcite .",

    "the chiral observables ( introduced below ) were measured after every 10th trajectory of unit length using 40 gaussian - distributed stochastic sources .    to convert our simulation parameters to physical units we use results on the determination of the lattice spacings in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd obtained by the hotqcd collaboration @xcite .",

    "since the dependence of the lattice scale on quark masses seems to be moderate down to the smallest quark mass value used in our study , we estimate the value of pseudo - scalar meson masses relevant for our choice of parameters by simply rescaling the pion mass obtained in the ( 2 + 1)-flavor studies by the corresponding ratio of the light quark masses , i.e. by @xmath31 . from this",

    "as pointed out before , estimates of critical pion masses tend to yield smaller values as one approaches closer to the continuum limit , either by going to finer lattice spacings or through using improved actions . while , in future , it will be essential to carry out lattice qcd calculations for smaller quark masses and closer to the continuum limit to establish the first order chiral phase transition region of 3-flavor qcd , and it is likely that this region will remain bounded by the critical pion mass estimated in the present study .",
