    "the kodaira - spencer theory of gravity was introduced by bershadsky , cecotti , ooguri and vafa @xcite as the closed string field theory corresponding to the @xmath6-twisted topological string theory . in the original formulation ,",
    "bcov theory ( as we call it ) is a field theory defined on a calabi - yau manifold of dimension @xmath3 . in @xcite",
    ", we formulated bcov theory on a calabi - yau manifold of any dimension .    in @xcite , the problem of constructing a perturbative quantization of bcov theory",
    "is left open .",
    "after all , bcov theory is a @xmath7-dimensional , interacting , and non - renormalizable theory .",
    "one therefore expects the theory to have an infinite number of counter - terms , and therefore an infinite number of coupling constants .",
    "in fact , there is an even more serious potential problem : as one proceeds in the loop expansion , there are infinitely many potential anomalies to quantization .",
    "so it is not at all obvious that any quantum theory even exists .",
    "one of the main properties of quantum field theory is _ locality _ , which allows us to build up the whole quantum theory from local data on the underlying manifold . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the problem of specifying a canonically - defined quantization of bcov theory on a local piece of odd dimensional calabi - yau manifold , i.e. , a flat space @xmath0 for any odd @xmath1 .",
    "we do this by considering the coupling of bcov theory to holomorphic chern - simons theory .",
    "holomorphic chern - simons is the open - string field theory for the topological @xmath6-model , and was introduced by witten @xcite .",
    "we can call the coupled theory open - closed bcov theory .",
    "the precise theorem is the following .",
    "on @xmath0 for @xmath1 odd , there exists a unique perturbative quantization of open - closed bcov theory , where in the open sector the gauge lie algebra is the super lie algebra @xmath8 , and we require the quantization to be compatible with inclusions @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , we construct a canonical quantization of coupling bcov theory with large @xmath10 holomorphic chern - simons theory ( with gauge group @xmath11 ) .",
    "in particular , one gets a quantization of the purely closed theory .",
    "( roughly speaking , this is for the same reason that closed string theory can exist on its own but that open string theory requires closed strings ) . as a corollary",
    ", we find    there is a canonical quantum bcov theory on @xmath0 ( for @xmath1 odd ) which extends to a quantization of the coupled open - closed theory .",
    "in other words , all the infinitely many possible counter - terms that can appear because the theory is non - renormalizable are uniquely fixed by the requirement of compatability with holomorphic chern - simons .",
    "some comments are in order :    1 .",
    "it is not possible to quantize holomorphic chern - simons theory by itself without coupling to the closed - string field theory .",
    "there is a one - loop anomaly in holomorphic chern - simons theory which is cancelled by the closed string sector .",
    "it is not possible to quantize the coupled open - closed theory where on the open sector we use the lie algebra @xmath12 as our gauge lie algebra , because of a one - loop anomaly .",
    "3 .   there is a variant of this story ( in @xmath3 complex dimensions ) which works for holomorphic chern - simons theory where the lie algebra of the gauge group is @xmath13 . in this case , to cancel the anomaly , we need to use a variant of bcov theory which we call @xmath4 bcov theory .",
    "the terminology is because of a conjectural relationship with the @xmath4 tensor multiplet in @xmath7 dimensions , which is similar to a relationship studied in the literature between bcov theory and the @xmath14 tensor multiplet .",
    "we construct a unique quantization of the system coupling @xmath4 bcov theory to @xmath13 holomorphic chern - simons theory , not just on @xmath15 but on a variety of non - compact calabi - yaus .",
    "the theorem is proved using the obstruction theory methods developed in @xcite for perturbative quantization . for any quantum field theory",
    ", there is a cochain complex ( built from possible lagrangians ) whose @xmath16 describes possible deformations of the theory , and whose @xmath17 describes anomalies , which are obstructions to quantization . for a renormalizable theory , one needs only consider a scale - invariant subcomplex of this obstruction - deformation complex , which will typically have finite dimensional cohomology groups . in this case",
    ", @xmath16 is the space of marginal deformations , which is typically finite dimensional , and the finite dimensionality of @xmath17 indicates that there are only finitely many possible anomalies . for a non - renormalizable theory , the scale invariance argument does not apply , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both typically infinite - dimensional .    for bcov theory on its own , or holomorphic chern - simons on its own , this is what we find .",
    "however , for the coupled open - closed bcov theory , we find a remarkable cancellation : beyond one loop , the obstruction - deformation complex for the coupled theory has zero cohomology .",
    "potential obstructions and deformations for the closed - string sector are precisely cancelled by obstructions and deformations from the mixed sectors and from the purely open sector .",
    "we will explain the heuristics of this argument in more detail later in the introduction .    at one loop ,",
    "we have to perform a detailed calculation to verify that a possible anomaly is cancelled .",
    "this cancellation is very similar to the green - schwartz mechanism for anomaly cancellation .      before discussing the proof in detail",
    ", we will explain a little about how this result relates to ideas from string theory , and in particular explain a conjectural framework relating our open - closed bcov theory in @xmath7 real dimensions to certain field theories of current interest in physics ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "bcov theory on @xmath15 is the closed - string field theory for the topological @xmath6-model in three complex dimensions .",
    "that is , the fields of bcov theory are the ( @xmath18-equivariant ) closed - string states of the topological @xmath6-model , and the classical bcov action functional can be described in terms of genus zero correlation functions of the @xmath6-model .",
    "the yoga of string theory tells us that for any string theory , one can construct a gravity theory as the low - energy limit of the closed - string field theory .",
    "for example , type iib supergravity is supposed to arise in this way from type iib string theory .",
    "this gravity theory will , of course , be non - renormalizable , and will have infinitely many coupling constants and infinitely many possible anomalies .",
    "however , the low energy limit of string theory is supposed to provide a canonically defined quantization of this non - renormalizable theory , which is why string theory can produce a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "bcov theory fits into this framework .",
    "it is a non - renormalizable theory of gravitational type ( gravitational , because the fields of bcov theory describe fluctuations of the complex structure of a calabi - yau , hence the calabi - yau metric ) .",
    "however , the yoga of string theory tells us that the topological string should provide a canonically defined quantization .",
    "this has not been rigorously proven : although categorical methods @xcite can provide a rigorous theory of the topological @xmath6-model , it is not known how to use these methods to produce something satisfying the locality axioms of a quantum field theory .",
    "what this paper achieves is to produce the canonically - defined quantization of bcov theory that one expects from string theory yoga , but _ without _ using topological string theory .",
    "although our methods are inspired by string theory , we do not use the string world - sheet at all .",
    "we find that a simple compatibility between bcov theory and holomorphic chern - simons theory is enough to fix the quantization uniquely .",
    "one can hope that our methods apply beyond topological strings , and give a new approach to quantizing other string theories .",
    "we hope to investigate this in future publications .",
    "one point at which our work connects directly to string theory is via the following conjecture .",
    "bcov theory on @xmath19 is a twist of type iib supergravity theory on @xmath20 .",
    "this conjecture will be explored in more detail in other publications .",
    "the concept of twisted supergravity is a slightly subtle one , and we will discuss it in more detail elsewhere .",
    "for now , let us explain the main idea .",
    "any supergravity theory has gauged local supersymmetry .",
    "to quantize the theory , one introduces fadeev - popov ghosts corresponding to local supersymmetries .",
    "the ghosts for fermionic symmetries will be bosonic fields .",
    "twisted supergravity is simply supergravity in perturbation theory around an unusual background , where the bosonic ghost field has some non - zero value .",
    "to satisfy the equations of motion , this bosonic ghost field must be a ( generalized ) killing spinor and have square zero .",
    "one reason for using the terminology `` twisted supergravity '' is that , if we consider a supersymmetric field theory in a supergravity background where the bosonic ghost field takes value some supercharge @xmath21 , this has the same effect as replacing the observables of the supersymmetric field theory by their @xmath21-cohomology .",
    "to the brst operator of the theory ] this procedure is often called twisting to the brst operator .",
    "it is often useful to use the term twisting for the more general procedure where one simply adds a supercharge to the brst operator . ] .",
    "different choices of bosonic ghost field give us different twists of supergravity .",
    "we need to describe which particular twist of type iib supergravity we conjecture is equivalent to bcov theory on @xmath19 . in type iib supergravity in the flat minkowski background , where all other bosonic fields are zero",
    ", there are @xmath22 covariant constant spinors .",
    "there is a unique @xmath23 invariant spinor @xmath21 which is of weight one under the `` naive '' @xmath24-symmetry group @xmath25 .",
    "the twisted supergravity we have in mind is the one where the bosonic ghost field takes value @xmath21 .",
    "if one accepts this conjecture , then the results of this paper give us a new method to quantize part of type iib supergravity .",
    "the open - string analog of the twist we consider was analyzed by baulieu @xcite , who showed that @xmath5-complex dimensional holomorphic chern - simons is the holomorphic twist of @xmath26-dimensional maximally supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "it is therefore natural to conjecture that the coupled open - closed bcov theory we construct is the holomorphic twist of the theory coupling type iib supergravity with the maximally supersymmetric @xmath26 dimensional gauge theory with gauge lie algebra @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , baulieu s result gives some strong evidence for the conjeture that bcov theory is a twist of type iib supergravity . as we will see shortly , the fields of bcov theory with the linearized brst operator are the universal cochain complex which can couple to holomorphic chern - simons by single - trace operators . at the classical level , type iib supergravity can be coupled to maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in @xmath26 dimensions , which is the gauge theory living on the @xmath28 brane , and this coupling is by single - trace operators .",
    "this implies that twisted type iib supergravity can be coupled to the twisted @xmath26 dimensional gauge theory , which is holomorphic chern - simons . since bcov theory is the universal object admitting such a coupling , we find in this way a cochain map from the fields of twisted supergravity ( equipped with the linearized brst operator ) to those of bcov theory .",
    "there is a conjectural relationship between open - closed bcov theory and certain @xmath7-dimensional field theories constructed from branes in type iia string theory and in @xmath29-theory .",
    "the @xmath4 supersymmetry algebra in @xmath7 dimensions has a unique @xmath30-invariant supercharge @xmath21 , up to rotation by the @xmath24-symmetry group . taking the cohomology with respect to such",
    "a @xmath21 gives a twist of any @xmath4 supersymmetric field theory .",
    "this twist is holomorphic in the sense discussed in @xcite .",
    "the following conjecture grew out of conversations with davide gaiotto .",
    "consider the following system of branes in type iia string theory on @xmath20 .",
    "we have a single @xmath31 brane on @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 is the locus where @xmath34 are zero .",

    "is a theory with @xmath4 supersymmetry .",
    "the conjecture is that the holomorphic twist of this theory is open - closed bcov theory where the lie algebra of the gauge group for the open sector is @xmath40 .",
    "let us discuss the evidence for this conjecture .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath41 , in which case the conjecture relates bcov theory to the theory living on the @xmath31 brane .",
    "the fields of the @xmath31 brane theory form a single tensor multiplet with @xmath14 supersymmetry .",
    "one of the fields of bcov theory is a closed @xmath42 form , which one expects to identify with @xmath43 of the @xmath26 components of the self dual @xmath3-form of the free @xmath14 tensor multiplet .",
    "marino , minasian , moore and strominger argued in @xcite that the supersymmetric equations of motion of the @xmath44 brane theory on a calabi - yau manifold include the kodaira - spencer equations which are the equations of motion of bcov theory .",
    "kapustin also argued @xcite that the partition function of the type iia @xmath31 brane theory is the same as the partition function of the topological @xmath6-model , i.e. of bcov theory .",
    "this provides some evidence in the case @xmath41 . for the more general case",
    ", one needs to understand a relationship between the @xmath36 brane gauge theory and holomorphic chern - simons , which we will sketch without proof ( and hopefully return to in a future publication ) .",
    "the claim is that there is a certain supercharge @xmath21 in the supersymmetry algebra acting on the @xmath36 brane gauge theory , which is @xmath30-invariant and also has the feature that every translation is @xmath21-exact .",
    "up to rotation by the @xmath24-symmetry group and scaling , these two features fix @xmath21 uniquely .",
    "the @xmath21-cohomology of the @xmath36 brane gauge theory is then a topological theory in the weak sense that the operators corresponding to translation in space time are trivial .",
    "the claim is that this twisted @xmath45 theory has a non - topological boundary condition where holomorphic chern - simons theory lives on the boundary .",

    "in this situation , they showed that after @xmath21-cohomology for a certain supercharge @xmath21 , the theory living on the @xmath3-manifold is ordinary chern - simons theory for the group @xmath52 .",
