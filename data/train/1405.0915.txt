    "in the last few years , many researchers tried to combine first - order logic and probability for modeling uncertain domains and performing inferece and learning . in the field of probabilistic logic programming ( plp for short ) many proposals have been presented .",
    "an effective and popular approach is the distribution semantics @xcite , which underlies many plp languages such as prism  @xcite , independent choice logic @xcite , logic programs with annotated disjunctions @xcite and problog @xcite . along this line",
    ", many reserchers proposed to combine probability theory with description logics ( dls for short ) @xcite .",
    "dls are at the basis of the web ontology language ( owl for short ) , a family of knowledge representation formalisms used for modeling information of the semantic web @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we presented disponte , a probabilistic semantics for dls based on the distribution semantics that allows probabilistic assertional and terminological knowledge .    in order to allow inference over the information in the semantic web , many efficient dl reasoners , such as pellet @xcite , racerpro @xcite and hermit @xcite ,",
    "have been developed . despite the availability of many dl reasoners ,",
    "the number of probabilistic reasoners is quite small . in @xcite",
    "we presented bundle , a reasoner based on pellet that extends it by allowing to perform inference on disponte theories .",
    "most of the available dl reasoners , included bundle , exploit procedural languages for implementing their reasoning algorithms .",
    "nonetheless , some of them use non - deterministic operators for doing inference .",
    "we implemented a reasoner , called trill @xcite , that exploits prolog for managing the non - determinism .",
    "then , we developed a new version of trill , called trill@xmath0 and we added in both versions the ability to manage disponte knowledge bases ( kbs for short ) and computing the probability of a query given a probabilistic kb under the disponte semantics .    since a problem of probabilistic kbs is that the parameters are difficult to define , in @xcite we presented edge that learns the parameters of a disponte kb from the information available in the domain .",
    "moreover , we are currently working on the extension of edge in order also to learn the structure of the probabilistic kb togheter with the parameters . in the field of plp , we are working at improving existing algorithms .",
    "we have considered lifted inference that allows to perform inference in a time that is polynomial in the variables domain size .",
    "we applied lifted variable elimination , and gc - fove @xcite in particular , to plp and developed the algorithm lp@xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ dl ] briefly introduces @xmath2 , while section [ disp ] presents the disponte semantics .",
    "section [ problem ] defines the problem of finding explanations for a probabilistic query w.r.t .",
    "a given probabilistic kb .",
    "section [ trill ] presents trill and trill@xmath0 and section [ related ] discusses related work .",
    "section [ exp ] shows experiments and section [ issues - achi ] discusses our achievements and future plans .",
    "finally , section  [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "dls are knowledge representation formalisms that are at the basis of the semantic web @xcite and are used for modeling ontologies .",
    "they are represented using a syntax based on concepts , basically sets of individuals of the domain , and roles , sets of pairs of individuals of the domain . in this section ,",
    "we recall the expressive description logic @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of @xmath3 dl , that is at the basis of owl dl .",

    ", _ roles _ and _ individuals_. a _ role _ is an atomic role @xmath7 .",

    "a kb @xmath30 is assigned a semantics in terms of set - theoretic interpretations @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a non - empty _ domain _ and @xmath33 is the _ interpretation function _ that assigns an element in @xmath34 to each @xmath35 , a subset of @xmath32 to each @xmath8 and a subset of @xmath36 to each @xmath7 .",
    "a query @xmath37 over a kb @xmath30 is an axiom for which we want to test the entailment from the knowledge base , written @xmath38 .",
    "the entailment test may be reduced to checking the unsatisfiability of a concept in the knowledge base , i.e. , the emptiness of the concept .",
    "for example , the entailment of the axiom @xmath25 may be tested by checking the satisfiability of the concept @xmath39 .",
    "disponte @xcite applies the distribution semantics @xcite of probabilistic logic programming to dls .",
    "a program following this semantics defines a probability distribution over normal logic programs called _",
    "worlds_. then the distribution is extended to queries and the probability of a query is obtained by marginalizing the joint distribution of the query and the programs .    in disponte ,",
    "a _ probabilistic knowledge base _",
    "@xmath30 is a set of _ certain axioms _ or _",
    "probabilistic axioms _ in which each axiom is independent evidence .",
    "certain axioms take the form of regular dl axioms while probabilistic axioms are @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a real number in @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 is a dl axiom .",
    "the idea of disponte is to associate independent boolean random variables to the probabilistic axioms . to obtain a _ world _ , we include every formula obtained from a certain axiom . for each probabilistic axiom ,",
    "we decide whether to include it or not in @xmath44 .",
    "a world therefore is a non probabilistic kb that can be assigned a semantics in the usual way .",
    "a query is entailed by a world if it is true in every model of the world .",
    "the probability @xmath41 can be interpreted as an _ epistemic probability _ ,",
    "i.e. , as the degree of our belief in axiom @xmath43 .",
    "for example , a probabilistic concept membership axiom @xmath45 means that we have degree of belief @xmath41 in @xmath46 .",
    "a probabilistic concept inclusion axiom of the form @xmath47 represents our belief in the truth of @xmath27 with probability @xmath41 .",
    "formally , an _ atomic choice _ is a couple @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath50th probabilistic axiom and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 indicates whether @xmath49 is chosen to be included in a world ( @xmath52 = 1 ) or not ( @xmath52 = 0 ) .",

    "a _ selection _",

    "world _ in this way : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the set of certain axioms .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath62 the set of all selections and with @xmath63 the set of all worlds .",
    "the probability of a world @xmath59 is @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is a probability distribution over worlds , i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "we can now assign probabilities to queries .",
    "given a world @xmath44 , the probability of a query @xmath37 is defined as @xmath67 if @xmath68 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the probability of a query can be defined by marginalizing the joint probability of the query and the worlds , i.e. @xmath69 .    [ people+petsxy ]    consider the following kb , inspired by the ` people+pets ` ontology @xcite : @xmath70 + @xmath71 +   the kb indicates that the individuals that own an animal which is a pet are nature lovers with a 50% probability and that @xmath72 has the animals @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "fluffy and @xmath74 are cats and cats are pets with probability 60% .",
    "we associate a boolean variable to each axiom as follow @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the kb has four worlds and the query axiom @xmath81 is true in one of them , the one corresponding to the selection @xmath82 .",
    "the probability of the query is @xmath83 .",
    "[ people+pets_comb ]    sometimes we have to combine knowledge from multiple , untrusted sources , each one with a different reliability .",
    "consider a kb similar to the one of example [ people+petsxy ] but where we have a single cat , @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath84 +    and there are two sources of information with different reliability that provide the information that @xmath73 is a cat . on one source",
    "the user has a degree of belief of 0.4 , i.e. , he thinks it is correct with a 40% probability , while on the other source he has a degree of belief 0.3 .",
    "the user can reason on this knowledge by adding the following statements to his kb : @xmath85 +   the two statements represent independent evidence on @xmath73 being a cat .",
    "we associate @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) to the first ( second ) probabilistic axiom .",
    "the query axiom @xmath81 is true in 3 out of the 4 worlds , those corresponding to the selections @xmath88 .",
    "so @xmath89 this is reasonable if the two sources can be considered as independent . in fact , the probability comes from the disjunction of two independent boolean random variables with probabilities respectively 0.4 and 0.3 : @xmath90",
    "traditionally , a reasoning algorithm decides whether an axiom is entailed or not by a kb by refutation : the axiom @xmath43 is entailed if @xmath91 has no model in the kb .",
    "besides deciding whether an axiom is entailed by a kb , we want to find also explanations for the axiom .    the problem of finding explanations for a query has been investigated by various authors @xcite .",
    "it was called _ axiom pinpointing _ in @xcite and considered as a non - standard reasoning service useful for tracing derivations and debugging ontologies . in particular , in @xcite the authors define _ minimal axiom sets _ ( _ minas _ for short ) .    let @xmath30 be a knowledge base and @xmath37 an axiom that follows from it , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "we call a set @xmath92 a _ minimal axiom set _ or _ mina _ for @xmath37 in @xmath30 if @xmath93 and it is minimal w.r.t . set inclusion .",
    "the problem of enumerating all minas is called min - a - enum .",
    "all - minas(@xmath94 ) is the set of all minas for query @xmath37 in knowledge base @xmath30 .",
    "reasoners such as pellet solve the min - a - enum problem by finding a single mina using a tableau algorithm and then applying the _ hitting set _ @xcite algorithm for finding all the others .",
    "a _ tableau _ is a graph where each node represents an individual @xmath95 and is labeled with the set of concepts @xmath96 it belongs to .",
    "each edge @xmath97 in the graph is labeled with the set of roles to which the couple @xmath98 belongs .",
    "then , a set of consistency preserving tableau expansion rules are repeatedly applied until a clash ( i.e. , a contradiction ) is detected or a clash - free graph is found to which no more rules are applicable .",
    "a clash is for example a couple @xmath99 where @xmath11 and @xmath16 are present in the label of a node , i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "some expansion rules are non - deterministic , i.e. , they generate a finite set of tableaux .",
    "thus the algorithm keeps a set of tableaux that is consistent if there is any tableau in it that is consistent , i.e. , that is clash - free . each time a clash is detected in a tableau @xmath101 ,",
    "the algorithm stops applying rules to @xmath101 .",
    "once every tableau in @xmath102 contains a clash or no more expansion rules can be applied to it , the algorithm terminates .",
    "if all the tableaux in the final set @xmath102 contain a clash , the algorithm returns unsatisfiable as no model can be found .",
    "otherwise , any one clash - free completion graph in @xmath102 represents a possible model for the concept and the algorithm returns satisfiable .",
    "the hitting set algorithm is a black box method : it repeatedly removes an axiom from the kb and then computes again a mina recording all the different minas so found .",
    "min - a - enum is required to answer queries to kbs following the disponte semantics . to compute the probability of a query ,",
    "the explanations must be made mutually exclusive , so that the probability of each individual explanation is computed and summed with the others .",
    "this can be done by exploiting a splitting algorithm as shown in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can assign independent boolean random variables to the axioms contained in the explanations and defining the disjunctive normal form ( dnf ) boolean formula @xmath103 which models the set of explanations .",
    "thus @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the set of boolean random variables .",
    "we can now translate @xmath103 to a binary decision diagram ( bdd ) , from which we can compute the probability of the query with a dynamic programming algorithm that is linear in the size of the bdd .",
    "trill @xcite implements the tableau algorithm using prolog . in this way",
    ", we do not have to implement a search strategy , such as the hitting set algorithm , because the management of the non - determinism is demanded to prolog .",
    "trill takes as input an owl dl ontology translated into prolog facts by using the thea2 library @xcite . for example , a subclass axiom @xmath106 is translated into ` subclass(cat,pet ) ` while for more complex axioms , thea2 uses prolog lists , so the axiom @xmath107 is translated into ` equivalentclasses([naturelover,unionof([petowner,gardenowner ] ) ] ) ` .",
    "trill builds a tableau following the tableau algorithm .",
    "the non - deterministic rules are treated differently from the deterministic ones .",
    "while the latter ones are implemented by predicates that take as input a tableau and return a single tableau , the former ones are implemented by predicates that take as input a tableau but return a list of tableaux from which one is non - deterministically chosen .",
    "the computation of all - minas(@xmath94 ) is performed by simply calling ` findall/3 ` over the tableau predicate .",
    "a new version of trill , called trill@xmath0 , resolves the axiom pinpointing problem by computing a _ pinpointing formula _",
    "@xcite instead of a set of minas . to define the pinpointing formula we first have to associate a boolean variable to each axiom of the kb @xmath30 .",
    "the pinpointing formula is a monotone boolean formula on these variables .",
    "this formula compactly encodes the set of all minas .",
    "let assume that each axiom @xmath43 of a kb @xmath30 is associated with the propositional variable @xmath108 .",
    "the set of all propositional variables is indicated with @xmath109 .",
    "a valuation @xmath110 of a monotone boolean formula is the set of propositional variables that are true . for a valuation @xmath111 ,",
    "let @xmath112 .",
    "+    given a query @xmath37 and a kb @xmath30 , a monotone boolean formula @xmath113 over @xmath109 is called a _ pinpointing formula _ for @xmath37",
    "if for every valuation @xmath114 it holds that @xmath115 if @xmath110 satisfies @xmath113 .    in lemma 2.4 of @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that we can obtain all minas from a pinpointing formula by transforming the formula into dnf and removing disjuncts implying other disjuncts . from this formula ,",
    "the construction of bdd can be performed as for minas . for formal definitions",
    "see @xcite .",
    "[ people+pets ]    consider the kb of example [ people+petsxy ] with the same association between boolean variables and axioms .",
    "let @xmath81 be the query , then all - minas(@xmath94 ) @xmath116 @xmath117 , while the pinpointing formula is @xmath118 .",
    "in order to build the bdds and compute the associated probabilities , trill and trill@xmath0 exploit a prolog library of the ` cplint ` suite @xcite .",
    "the code of trill and trill@xmath0 is available at https://sites.google.com/a/unife.it/ml/trill .",
    "dl reasoners written in prolog do not need to implement a backtracking algorithm but can exploit prolog backtracking facilities for performing the search .",
    "this has been observed in various works .",
    "proposed a tableau reasoner in prolog for fol based on variable - free semantic tableaux , but it is not tailored to dls . presented the implementation of a prolog reasoner for the dl @xmath119 .",
    "improved it by implementing heuristic search techniques to reduce the running time .",
    "added to its work the possibility of returning explanations for queries w.r.t .",
    "@xmath2 kbs . presented the kaon2 algorithm that exploits basic superposition , a refutational theorem proving method for fol with equality and a new inference rule , called decomposition , to reduce a @xmath120 kb into a disjunctive datalog program .",
    "presented dlog , that is an abox reasoning algorithm for the @xmath120 language .",
    "it allows to store the content of the abox externally in a database and to answer abox queries by transforming the kb into a prolog program .",
    "trill and trill@xmath0 differ from these works for the considered dl and , in particular , from dlog for the capability of answering general queries .",
    "presented foproblog that is based on problog , in which a program contains a set of _ probabilistic facts _ , i.e. facts annotated with probabilities , and a set of general clauses which can have positive and negative probabilistic facts in their body .",
    "each fact is assumed to be probabilistically independent .",
    "it follows the distribution semantics and exploits bdds to compute the probability of queries .",
    "foproblog is a reasoner for fol that is not tailored to dls , so the algorithm could be suboptimal . it does not exploit a tableau algorithm and can not manage probabilistic facts which are annotated with more than one probability value .",
    "a different approach is the one of that presented ontodlv , a system for reasoning on logic - based ontology representation language , called ontodlp .",
    "ontodlp is an extension of ( disjunctive ) asp and can interoperate with owl .",
    "ontodlv rewrites the owl kb into the ontodlp language , can retrieve information directly from external owl ontologies and answers queries by using asp .",
    "bundle @xcite is a probabilistic reasoner that computes the probability of queries from probabilistic kbs that follow the disponte semantics .",
    "it is based on pellet and is completely written in java .",
    "it exploits a modified version of pellet for finding the all - minas set and then it translates it into a bdd from which it computes the probability of the query . similarly to bundle , pronto @xcite is based on pellet and performs inference on p-@xmath120(d ) kbs in which the probabilistic part contains _ conditional contraints _ of the form @xmath121 $ ] that informally mean `` generally , if an object belongs to @xmath11 , then it belongs to @xmath19 with a probability in the interval @xmath122 $ ] '' .",
    "p-@xmath120(d ) @xcite uses probabilistic lexicographic entailment from probabilistic default reasoning and allows both terminological and assertional probabilistic knowledge about instances of concepts and roles .",
    "p-@xmath120(d ) is based on nilsson s probabilistic logic @xcite in which the probabilistic interpretation @xmath123 defines a probability distribution over the set of interpretations @xmath124 instead of a probability distribution over theories .",
    "the probability of a logical formula @xmath125 according to @xmath123 , denoted @xmath126 , is the sum of all @xmath127 such that @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we did several experiments in order to evaluate the performances of the algorithms we have implemented . here",
    "we report a comparison between the performances of trill , trill@xmath0 and bundle when computing probability for queries .",
    "we used four different knowledge bases of various complexity : 1 ) brca models the risk factor of breast cancer ; 2 ) an extract of the dbpedia ontology obtained from wikipedia ; 3 ) biopax level 3 models metabolic pathways ; 4 ) vicodi contains information on european history .    for the tests , we used a version of the dbpedia and biopax kbs without the abox , a version of the brca with an abox containing 1 individual and a version of vicodi with an abox containing 19 individuals .",
    "to each kb , we added 50 probabilistic axioms . for each datasets we randomly created 100 different queries . in particular , for the dbpedia and biopax datasets we created 100 subclass - of queries while for the other kbs we created 80 subclass - of and 20 instance - of queries . for generating the subclass - of queries , we randomly selected two classes that are connected in the hierarchy of classes contained in the ontology , so that each query had at least one explanation .",
    "for the instance - of queries , we randomly selected an individual @xmath95 and a class to which @xmath95 belongs by following the hierarchy of the classes starting from the class to which @xmath95 is instantiated in the kb .",
    "table [ table : res ] shows , for each ontology , the average number of different minas computed and the average time in seconds that trill , trill@xmath0 and bundle took for answering the queries .",
    "in particular , the brca and the version of dbpedia that we used contain a large number of subclass axioms between complex concepts .",
    "these preliminary tests show that both trill and trill@xmath0 performances can sometimes be better than bundle , even if they lack all the optimizations that bundle inherits from pellet .",
    "this represents evidence that a prolog implementation of a semantic web tableau reasoner is feasible and that may lead to a practical system .",
