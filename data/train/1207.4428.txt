    "since the third component of the total spin for each dynamic shell @xmath72 commutes with the hamiltonian , we find the ground state ( g.s . ) within the subspace corresponding to the nel state @xmath73 , which amounts to diagonalizing a square matrix with up to @xmath74 states , and the excited states by diagonalizing the hamiltonian restricted to the subspaces @xmath75 allowed by the selection rules .",

    "[ unitcells](b ) feature wider widths , the average position is clearly shifted to high energies , which suggests that , not only the value of @xmath15 , but also the value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath47 may be too large in this context . a possible explanation",
    "might be related to the method by which the pure sample parameters  @xcite are obtained , whereby a semiclassical approximation is used to determine the spectrum parametrically as a function of @xmath47 , @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 , and later these parameters are fitted to match the experimental results .",
    "in essence , this procedure involves a calculation to first order in @xmath82 , which should give better results for @xmath83 i.e. , for the one - site approximation .",

    "for example , in ref .   certain empirical relations between the parameters of the pure of the diluted sample are proposed .    following these ideas , in fig .",
    "[ bestparam](a ) we show the result of an optimization of the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath47 to match the experimental results , which yielded @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "unfortunately , the correlation between these parameters and the uncertainties prevents a more accurate determination of these values or the simultaneous optimization of the less significant @xmath16 and @xmath17 that we have kept fixed .",
    "although the widths of the peaks are still too narrow , the intensities are quite well accounted for , and even a last peak at @xmath86 seems to be reproduced .    finally , as an estimate of the thermal effects in our simulations , in fig .",
    "[ bestparam](b ) we show a similar calculation at @xmath79 , i.e. , with a purely antiferromagnetic state ( no thermal disorder ) of the environment .",
    "note the distinctly narrower widths and poorer intensity relations between the peaks , particularly at high energies .",
    "there are a variety of possible reasons to explain the larger experimental widths : our scattering operator is oversimplified , as it does not take into account the relative orientation of the lattice and the wave vector of the incoming neutron , which we also assume perfectly well defined ( i.e. , we neglect the spread of the neutron beam ) ; the dynamic shells and their environments have been obtained from a classical ( rather than quantum ) monte carlo , which surely overestimates the spin ordering at low temperatures ; and the dynamic shells are limited to spins and their immediate neighbors .",
    "in summary , we have presented high - resolution spectra from neutron scattering experiments , conducted over @xmath87 close to its percolation threshold .",
    "we model these spectra in terms of a site diluted heisenberg model , containing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions . in spite of its simplicity and with only a moderate adjustment of the parameters , the proposed model accounts quite well for the position and intensity relations of the peaks in the spectra .",
    "this success is probably due to the validity of our main hypothesis , namely the local nature of the spin excitations in these systems which lie close to the percolation threshold for the @xmath48 lattice .    whereas local spin excitations dominate the energy spectrum for @xmath12 near @xmath5 in @xmath0 , we can not rule out a very small contribution from fracton excitations in a similar energy range .",
    "fracton excitations as well as local spin excitations coexist in isotropic systems and both may exist in the small anisotropy @xmath88 system as @xmath12 approaches @xmath5 . in that case , modeling the local spin excitations could aid in separating the two types of excitations , allowing the characterization of local spin excitations as well as the persistence of fracton excitations under conditions of weak anisotropy .",
