    "the formation of the milky way ( mw ) galaxy is a mystery unsolved yet .",
    "different models are trying to explain what were the initial conditions that lead to the actual structure of the mw .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the structure of the milky way , and other comparable disc galaxies , can be divided into three main components , the bulge , the galactic spheroid and the disc .",
    "the central bulge has a mass of @xmath1  m@xmath2 and a characteristic radius of about @xmath3  kpc .",
    "the galactic spheroid , which is also called the stellar halo , has a mass of @xmath4  m@xmath2 @xcite and its mass is mostly confined within the the solar radius .",
    "the stellar halo contains globular clusters , dwarf satellites and their tidal streams , that add up to a mass of about @xmath5  m@xmath2 .    for the mw",
    ", the disc can be subdivided into at least two parts : the thin disc with a mass of about @xmath6  m@xmath2 , that has exponential radial and vertical scale lengths of approximately @xmath7  kpc @xcite and @xmath8  pc @xcite respectively .",
    "the other part is the thick disk which has scale lengths of @xmath9  kpc and @xmath10  kpc @xcite . near the sun , the thick disc",
    "comprises about @xmath11  per cent of the thin disc mass , so that the thick disc mass amounts to @xmath12 .",
    "the thick disc is made up mostly of low - metalicity @xmath13 \\leq -0.4)$ ] stars that have a velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disc plane of @xmath14  pcmyr@xmath15 , compared to the significantly smaller @xmath16 of the thin disc , which varies from about @xmath17  pcmyr@xmath15 for the young stars @xcite .",
    "these authors measured the velocity dispersion in the solar neighbourhood as a function of age of the stars .",
    "the oldest stars in their sample ( cns4 ) have about @xmath18  pcmyr@xmath15 for @xmath19  gyr old stars .",
    "but then this value might be contaminated by thick disc stars .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of the thick disc in galaxies .",
    "one of these mechanisms was proposed by @xcite , who suggest that the formation of the thick disc is the direct accretion of stars from disrupted satellites .",
    "the process of accretion occurs approximately at coplanar orbits .",
    "another explanation was suggested by @xcite and @xcite , who consider the process of radial migration of the stars . in this mechanism , the stars which end up in the thick disc are trapped onto a resonant co - rotation with spiral arms and may migrate inwards and outwards along the spiral waves .",
    "this process conserves angular momentum and does not lead to significant heating of the disc .",
    "another possible scenario is proposed by e.g.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite and consists of the thickening of a pre - existing thin disc through minor mergers .",
    "the thick disc is formed by the dynamical heating that is induced by satellites merging with a primordial , rotationally supported thin disc .",
    "finally , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the formation of the thick disc is triggered in situ .",
    "the process of star formation occurs during / after gas rich mergers .",
    "each model explains different aspects and has its own implications for the disc s kinematical and chemical properties . in the scenario of @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to distinguish two different dynamics for the orbits of the stars , and they allow one to identify two different components of the disc .",
    "the thin disc is a kinematically cold component with stars on circular orbits , and the thick disc is a kinematically hot component with stars with orbital parameters transitional between the thin disc and the spheroid .",
    "the nature of the population of stars in the thick disc comes from the tidal debris of satellites , whose orbital plane is roughly coincident with the disc .",
    "their orbits were circularized by dynamical friction prior to their complete disruption .",
    "however , there is evidence for enhanced @xmath20-elements abundances in thick - disc stars .",
    "this indicates a short star formation time - scale in which enrichment is dominated by type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) @xcite , rather than the slower time - scale expected for dwarf galaxies . in this case",
    ", one needs to consider the existence of an active epoch of gas - rich mergers in the past history of galaxy , with the bulk of the thick disc forming in situ @xcite , and strong stellar scattering of clumps formed by gravitational instabilities @xcite ( rather than being accreted from satellites ) to explain these observations .    during the last years understanding of star formation and star cluster formation",
    "has progressed .",
    "now we know that almost all stars form in a clustered mode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and follow - up publications ) .",
    "the star clusters form with low star formation efficiencies and , therefore , they lose a large part of their stars that expand outwards when residual gas is expelled by the action of massive stars . in this context",
    ", @xcite suggested another mechanism for the formation of the thick disc . considering the star cluster formation process described above",
    ", massive star clusters may add kinematically hot components to galactic field populations , building up , in this way , both galactic discs .     according to the @xcite model",
    ", the velocity dispersion of the stars in expansion ( the new field population ) is related with the mass of the initial star cluster , with its radius and also with the efficiency of star formation ( eq .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "it is proportional to the square root of the mass of the star cluster , such that heavier star clusters will generate a field population that presents higher dispersion velocities .",
    "thus , a simple estimate suggests that clusters of mass near @xmath21  m@xmath2 may contribute new field populations that have a velocity dispersion of about @xmath22  pcmyr@xmath15 which is similar to the velocity dispersion of the thick disk .",
    "in this work we perform numerical simulations to investigate this scenario for the formation of both galactic discs of the milky way .",
    "to accomplish this investigation we use star clusters of different masses and we consider their disruption under distinct low star formation efficiencies ( we refer to such clusters as popping star clusters ) .",
    "we place the star cluster on an orbit around the galactic centre at the solar radius of @xmath23  kpc and observe how the stars of these star clusters distribute themselves in the potential of the mw .    in the next section",
    "we describe the detailed setup of our investigation and describe our results in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "we discuss our findings in the last section ( [ sec : conc ] ) .",
    "we simulate the popping star cluster using the particle mesh code superbox @xcite , which has moving high - resolution sub - grids , which stay focused on the star cluster .",
    "these sub - grids provide high spatial resolution at the place of interest .",
    "a particle - mesh code neglects by default close encounters between the particles ( which are rather representations of the phase - space than actual single stars ) and is therefore called collision - less . with a collision - less code",
    "it is possible to simulate galaxies without having to use the actual number of stars ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "a code as superbox is in principle unsuitable to simulate star clusters , as with them two - body relaxation effects are important and govern their evolution . in our study",
    "we dissolve the star clusters immediately , dispersing their stars within a short time ( a few crossing times ) into the overall potential of the mw , therewith being in a regime where near encounters between stars do not play any rle . now",
    "the ability of superbox to model particles with arbitrary masses gives us the possibility to sample the phase space ( e.g.  by using more particles than actual stars in the star cluster ) more precisely .",
    "the code is fast and resource - efficient , i.e.  it requires a small amount of computer memory .",
    "therefore , this code enables its user to simulate objects with millions of particles , with high resolution , and it can run on normal desktop computers .",
    "superbox has two levels of high resolution sub - grids .",
    "the highest resolution grid has a resolution ( i.e. cell - length ) of @xmath25  pc and covers the initially dense sc completely .",
    "the medium resolution grid has a cell - length of @xmath22  pc and covers the complete @xmath26-height of interest .",
    "finally the outermost grid covers the complete orbit of the scs around the centre of the mw with a resolution of @xmath27  kpc .    regarding the fixed time - step of superbox we choose initially a value to ensure that the scs are kept stable without further influence .",
    "therefore the time - steps were different for the different masses ranging from @xmath28  myr for the @xmath29  m@xmath2-clusters , via @xmath30 and @xmath31  myr to @xmath32  yr ( @xmath33  myr ) for the most massive clusters ( @xmath34  m@xmath2 ) .",
    "as these tiny time - steps require very long simulation times until we finally would reach @xmath19  gyr , we check the simulations and stop them as soon as the scs are completely dissolved . when all stars are unbound and just traveling under the influence of the global potential , we restart the simulations with a larger time - step of @xmath35  myr .",
    "we consider the following set - up for our simulation .",
    "the potential of the mw is modeled as an analytical background potential consisting of a hernquist sphere to generate the bulge , @xmath36 using @xmath37  m@xmath2 and @xmath38  kpc , the miamoto - nagai model to mimic the disc , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41  kpc and @xmath42  kpc . finally , we use a logarithmic potential to account for the rotation curve of the mw disk , @xmath43 with @xmath44  kms@xmath15 and @xmath45  kpc .",
    "the superposition of these components gives a good analytical representation of the milky way potential today .",
    "the potential of the mw is kept constant throughout the simulation . this is highly idealised as we expect the galaxy to grow and evolve over this period of time .",
    "we discuss this issue further in sect .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    ".initial conditions of the plummer spheres which represent the star clusters for each simulations .",
    "the first column shows the initial plummer radius of the star clusters , the second the initial mass of the sphere and the third the initial characteristic velocity dispersion .",
    "finally the fourth and fifth columns represent the sfe and the final mass after gas expulsion . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as with the @xmath46distribution we now investigate how our results change if we adopt an icmf .",
    "we combine our models the same way as done for the @xmath26-distribution and show the combined velocity distribution in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vel - icmf ] ( and also in the last line of tab .",
    "[ tab : vel ] ) . the derived probability plot to this distribution",
    "is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vel - icmf ] .",
    "fitting straight lines to the inner and outer parts give velocity dispersions of @xmath47 and @xmath48  kms@xmath15 for the thin and thick disc component respectively .",
    "as we can see , the velocity dispersion is much larger in the thick disc than in the thin disc . comparing our values of the solar neighborhood with published observations @xcite , which report @xmath49",
    "kms@xmath15 and @xmath50  kms@xmath15 for the thick disc and thin disc respectively , shows that we underestimate the thin disc values quite substantially and overestimate the value for the thick disc .",
    "an explanation could be that we do not take any other scattering mechanisms into account , which would elevate our thin disc dispersion .",
    "for the thick disc it could probably be , that there never were any scs with @xmath34  m@xmath2 formed in the history of the mw .",
    "these high - mass clusters are mainly responsible for the elevated velocity dispersion in the thick disc component of our models",
    ".      one interesting result can be observed in our simulation when we focus on the @xmath26-distribution of the stars at early stages ( @xmath51  gyr ) of the sc evolution . for an example , in fig  [ fig : chris2 ] we show the @xmath26-distribution of the stars , after @xmath52  myr , for the simulation with an initial mass of @xmath53  m@xmath2 and a sfe of @xmath25 .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm    the shape of the @xmath26-distribution looks like a christmas tree ( this effect was seen in our simulations shortly before christmas 2009 ) . the origin of this shape can be explained by considering the dynamical processes during the sc evolution .",
    "the star cluster is orbiting on a circular orbit around the galactic centre .",
    "after gas expulsion , some of the stars acquire higher expanding velocities and form the thick disc .",
    "we show in fig  [ fig : fish-1 ] in the top left panel the @xmath54-velocity distribution as a function of the distance between @xmath55 and @xmath56  kpc from the galactic centre after @xmath52  myr ( i.e. about one orbital period ) .",
    "the velocities show discrete layers .",
    "a similar behaviour is also described in @xcite where the tidal tails of scs show density enhancements with regular spacings stemming from the turn - around points of the escaped stars on epicycles .",
    "we suspect that our christmas tree has a similar explanation and is due to the turn - around points of stars on their @xmath26-oscillations ( @xmath26-epicycle ) .",
    "@xcite report that their star clusters have to be sufficiently long lived to show this behaviour in their tidal tails , while we see this effect very early in the evolution of our models .",
    "the reason for this difference is quite simple . in the simulations of @xcite the star clusters are in virial equilibrium and loose stars through tidal and two - body effects quite slowly .",
    "therefore it needs a long time for the tidal tails to form and evolve .",
    "thus , in the @xcite case the epicyclic motions of stars evaporating from star clusters are nearly coherent or in - phase since the stars leave the cluster with very similar and small velocities .",
    "the popping clusters , on the other hand , expel stars with a larger range of velocities within a short time - span .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm = 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm = 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm = 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm = 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm = 8.5 cm = 6.5 cm    the middle and lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fish-1 ] show that we only see this phenomenon in the @xmath54-velocities , while @xmath57 ( radial velocity ) and @xmath58 ( azimuthal velocity ) show a simple bulk motion ( except for a few stars which lag behind ) .",
    "this special appearance of the christmas tree gets later erased and transformed into a smooth distribution as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : space ] . also the velocities in @xmath54",
    "do not show the quantized behaviour any longer as we can see in the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fish-1 ] .",
    "the transient tree feature more or less disappears when the stars which form the leading arm of the tidal tails wrap all around the whole orbit and start to overlap with the trailing stars filling the gaps in velocity space .",
    "a deeper theoretical explanation for this astonishing feature is not part of this paper and will be dealt with in a future publication .    in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fish-1 ] we show the particle velocities after @xmath19  gyr of simulations . while we clearly see that the quantized nature in the @xmath54-component has washed out ( see above ) a new feature has appeared . in all our simulations we see",
    "over- and under - densities in the azimuthal @xmath58-velocities .",
    "this quantization is not as sharp as formerly seen in @xmath54 but still clearly visible .",
    "we call this feature azimuthal fish , because of its form .",
    "we believe that this quantization is the direct counterpart of the density enhancements in tidal tails which are reported by @xcite .",
    "the only difference between their and our models is that they investigate slowly evolving globular clusters ( gcs ) , which loose their mass slowly over long time - intervals , while our models have dissolved rapidly and the stars spread out much faster and wider than seen in @xcite .",
    "we will investigate this problem further and report about it in a follow up paper .",
    "we compute models of dissolving embedded star clusters on circular orbits around the mw .",
    "the aim of our study is to investigate if scs of different mass , sfe and gas - expulsion time can support not only the distribution of stars and their velocities in the thin disc of the mw but also in the thick disc .        *",
    "the stars of dissolved scs form density distributions in the @xmath26-direction which can be best fitted by exponential profiles . * while low - mass scs ( masses of the order of @xmath29 and @xmath59  m@xmath2 ) contribute only to a component similar to the thin disc of the mw , high mass clusters(masses @xmath60",
    "m@xmath2 ) show distributions which can be described best by two exponential profiles and therefore their stars contribute into two components similar to the thin and thick disc of the mw .",
    "* the velocity dispersion of the stars distributed into the thin component show a much lower velocity dispersion than the actual dispersion of the thin disc of the mw .",
    "this may be due to the fact that we do not take any other mechanisms to enhance the velocity dispersion into account ( e.g.  spiral arms , giant molecular clouds , other scs , ... ) * the thick component of our model shows a velocity dispersion which is higher than observed in the mw thick disc .",
    "we therefore conclude that inside the mw disc scs with masses comparable to @xmath34  m@xmath2 might never have formed .",
    "the thick component of our @xmath61  m@xmath2 model has enough velocity dispersion to explain the thick disc .",
    "this is in nice agreement with the analytical results of @xcite .",
    "we need to discuss these findings a bit further . on the first glance it seems to be rather odd that stars of one dissolved star cluster should spread into two distinct distributions with two distinct velocity dispersions .",
    "the density distribution of all our dissolved clusters exhibits a very distinct profile showing a peak around small @xmath26-distances and a kind of envelope of large @xmath26-distances .",
    "the transition between these two parts is rather continuous and not sharp .",
    "we see that for low - mass clusters the peak is more pronounced than the envelope and therefore they can be fitted best by a single exponential profile .",
    "also the stars in the envelope do not extend to @xmath26-heights comparable to the thick disc . for high - mass clusters we see a very substantial envelope , reaching out to high @xmath26-distances , and",
    "therefore are better described by two exponentials .",
    "the same is true for the distribution of @xmath54-velocities .",
    "the distribution is similar in shape to the distribution of velocities found in stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "it is neither a single nor a double gaussian but rather a continuous overlay of many gaussians .",
    "nevertheless , the usual observational procedure to analyse these distributions is to fit two gaussians to the probability plot and assigning two velocity dispersions to it - one for the thin disc component and one for the thick disc component .",
    "so we followed the same method .",
    "again for low - mass clusters there are no stars with high velocities and therefore we only assign one velocity dispersions to their distributions .",
    "another issue , which needs to be discussed , is the constant analytical potential used in this study .",
    "it is clear that in the distant past the disc(s ) of the mw were much smaller in mass and maybe in size .",
    "a popping star cluster would spread its stars to much larger @xmath26-heights much more easily .",
    "so it would rather help our scenario to explain the thick disc .",
    "furthermore the adiabatic heating of stars due to the growth in mass of the mw will enhance the velocity dispersion of the stars and bring them onto orbits with higher @xmath26-distances .",
    "besides , it is well known that the thick disc and thin disc components have a different chemical history",
    ". the ratios of @xmath20-(o , mg , si , ca , and ti ) elements , for example , are higher for stars in the thick disc than for stars of the thin disc at given metallicity @xcite .",
    "this indicates a short star formation time - scale in which enrichment is dominated by type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) @xcite .",
    "supernovae events guide the gas expulsion process , that together with all the other scattering mechanisms , might also help to move stars from the peak structure into the envelope structure .",
    "this would explain the problem that we do not see stars with thick disc chemical properties amongst thin disc stars and , therefore , why we see different populations of stars with different chemical properties in the thin and thick disc of our mw now",
    ". another possibility would be if the mw saw an early epoch of star formation , where the formation of low - mass clusters was suppressed ( in comparison with the evidence for this from top - heavy galaxy - wide initial mass functions of stars in young galaxies * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore are able to show that one does not need any merger scenarios to explain the structure of the mw disc .",
    "the simple assumption that all stars form in scs is enough to explain the thin as well as the thick disc of our mw , thus confirming the analytical calculations by @xcite rather nicely .",
    "these models are applied by @xcite as a possible explanation not only of the thick disk , but also of the observed but hitherto not understood secular heating of the thin disk . here the notion raised is that the observed thickening of the mw thin disk with age may be due to a falling star - formation rate ( sfr ) since the past 10  gyr , whereby a small sfr implies the formation of scs with small masses @xcite .    while conducting our experiments we detected two new effects within the distributions of the stars .",
    "after about one revolution around the galaxy the stars have spread in the @xmath26-direction in to a form that has striking similarities to a christmas - tree . as the discovery was made shortly before christmas we called the effect officially christmas - tree distribution . at the same time the distribution of @xmath54-velocities seems to have only certain discrete values .",
    "this feature is transient and disappears after several revolutions about the mw .",
    "we suspect that this is the case when the leading and trailing arms wrap completely around the galaxy and overlap at the former sc position .",
    "then the velocities of the leading arm fall into the gaps of the velocity distribution of the trailing stars . the reason to see a peculiar distribution like the christmas - tree in the first place is still not fully investigated and will be dealt with in a follow - up paper .",
    "we suspect that we see a similar behaviour in @xmath26 as is reported by @xcite along the tidal tails .",
    "the second effect showed up towards the end of our simulations .",
    "this effect consists of peculiar over- and under - densities in the @xmath58 velocities which show a pattern that reminded us of a fish .",
    "we therefore called this effect the azimuthal fish .",
    "even though the tidal tails of the dissolved star clusters are well mixed towards the end of the simulations so that we can not see any density variations in the positions , we believe that our fish pattern is directly related to the slowly evolving tidal tails of gcs and their density variations . as the quantized velocities associated with the christmas - tree we see now the left - over velocity signatures of a similar effect in azimuthal direction . , while the positional counterpart is not visible due to the fast evolution of our models . also this effect will be investigated further and reported about in a following publication .    as a final comment we state again that our models are able to reproduce the structural features of the mw .",
    "our models add therefore another possible explanation of how the discs of the mw and similar galaxies may have acquired their properties .",
    "which theory will be right - future observation might tell or even show that we might deal with a superposition of all theories at the same time . + * acknowledgments : * pa is supported through a chilean conicyt grant and a deutscher akademischer austauschdienst ( daad ) grant .",
