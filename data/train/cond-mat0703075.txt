    "in recent years , we witnessed great progress in the field of solid - state quantum information processing , like the coherent control of single qubits @xcite and two - qubit gates.@xcite one of the major remaining challenges is decoherence : the interaction of the qubits with their environment reduces the indispensable quantum coherence and entanglement of the quantum states .",
    "this relates to the scalability of the present few - qubit setups , because decoherence becomes more pronounced as the number of qubits increases .",
    "understanding the scaling of multi - qubit decoherence is also experimentally relevant , as many groups take the challenge of implementing more complex qubit architectures with solid - state devices .",
    "not all many - qubit states are equally sensitive to the influence of an environment . depending on the symmetries of the qubits - environment coupling",
    ", there can exist distinguished subspaces of a @xmath0-qubit hilbert space that are effectively decoupled from the environment and , thus , form so - called decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs).@xcite these allow one to implement logical decoherence - free qubits with two or several physical qubits .",
    "therefore , given an architecture for @xmath0 physical qubits , it is essential to identify the sets of robust quantum states that suffer least from decoherence .    the substrate that supports the qubits also possesses its own degrees of freedom like nuclear spins and phonons .",
    "they generally are coupled to the qubits and , thereby , cause quantum dissipation and decoherence.@xcite in experiments , one usually observes both dephasing and relaxation , with dephasing happening on a faster time scale.@xcite it has been noted that the reduced qubit dynamics in principle can be solved exactly if the qubits experience pure phase noise,@xcite and here we focus on this case as well . in ref .  , we recently presented explicit expressions for the dephasing of two initially entangled qubits .",
    "a central conclusion of that work is that the entanglement of a robust entangled state@xcite is not perfectly stable but undergoes an initial decay , stemming from the spatial qubit separation sketched in fig .",
    "[ figcouplingtostring ] .",
    "this puts limitations on the applicability of the concept of decoherence - free subspaces , since at best decoherence - poor subspaces emerge instead .",

    "the w states play an important role in several protocols for quantum information processing , for example quantum teleportation,@xcite superdense coding @xcite and quantum games.@xcite in quantum optics , the w states have already been realized , first with three,@xcite and recently even with eight qubits.@xcite proposals exist to produce w states in atomic gases @xcite and in solid - state environments.@xcite    in the limit of weak system - bath coupling , a successful and common approach to quantum dissipation is provided by the bloch - redfield master equation.@xcite a cornerstone of this formulation is neglecting memory effects of the bath , so that one eventually obtains a markovian master equation .",
    "the indirect interaction of two separated qubits via the environment , however , introduces memory effects that arise when bath distortions can propagate from one qubit to another during a finite time .",

    "we pursue a twofold goal : first , we consider an arbitrary number of @xmath0 initially entangled qubits for which we present explicit expressions for the coherence loss .",
    "this shows how in a linear arrangement decoherence scales as a function of the number of qubits , and demonstrates the consequences of spatial qubit separations .",
    "the stability of the w states with respect to the system size @xmath0 has been studied previously,@xcite however for local decoherence models where the qubits couple to effectively independent heat baths .",
    "second , by making a weak - coupling approximation , we derive a non - markovian master equation approach that captures the main effects of the spatial separation .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being more intuitive , while still allowing algebraic methods@xcite to be applied to the problem of decoherence .",
    "a comparison of the master - equation dynamics and the exact dynamics therefore enables a better interpretation of the latter and a critical examination of the validity of the former .",
    "moreover , the master - equation approach will be applicable as well to other problems that do not possess an exact solution .",

    "<S> we consider qubits in a linear arrangement coupled to a bosonic field which acts as a quantum heat bath and causes decoherence . by taking the spatial separation of the qubits explicitly into account , the reduced qubit dynamics acquires an additional non - markovian element . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the time evolution of an entangled many - qubit w state , which for vanishing qubit separation remains robust under pure dephasing . for finite separation , by contrast , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is no longer decoherence - free . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , spatial noise correlations may prevent a complete dephasing . while a standard bloch - redfield master equation fails to describe this behavior even qualitatively , </S>",
    "<S> we propose instead a widely applicable causal master equation . here </S>",
    "<S> we employ it to identify and characterize decoherence - poor subspaces . </S>",
