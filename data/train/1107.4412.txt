    "quantum pumping is a transport mechanism which induces dc charge and spin currents in a nano - scale conductor in the absence of a bias voltage by means of a time - dependent control of some system parameters .",
    "research on quantum pumping has attracted continued interest since its prototypical proposition due to its importance in quantum dynamic theory and potential application in various fields@xcite .",
    "the pumped current ( pc ) and noise properties in various nano - scale structures were investigated such as the magnetic - barrier - modulated two dimensional electron gas@xcite , mesoscopic one - dimensional wire@xcite , quantum - dot structures@xcite , mesoscopic rings with aharonov - casher and aharonov - bohm effect@xcite , magnetic tunnel junctions@xcite , chains of tunnel - coupled metallic islands@xcite , the nanoscale helical wire@xcite , the tomonaga - luttinger liquid@xcite , and garphene - based devices@xcite .",
    "graphene continues to attract intense interest , especially as an electronic system in which charge carriers are dirac - like particles with linear dispersion and zero rest mass@xcite .",
    "quantum pumping properties of graphene - based devises have been investigated by several groups@xcite .",
    "it is found that the direction of the pc can be reversed when a high potential barrier demonstrates stronger transparency than a low one as an effect of the klein paradox@xcite .",
    "the shot noise properties of a quantum pump are important in two aspects : understanding the underlying mechanisms of the shot noise may offer possible ways to improve pumping efficiency and achieve optimal pumping . on the other hand ,",
    "the shot noise reflects current correlation and is sensitive to the pump source configuration@xcite . the pumped shot noise ( psn ) properties may provide further information of the correlation between the transport dirac fermions of graphene governed by the klein paradox and electron chirality .",
    "however , this topic has not ever been looked into . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the psn properties in adiabatically modulated graphene - based double - barrier structures based on general expressions we derived from the scattering approach .",
    "the effect of the klein paradox on the psn is illuminated .",
    "the crystal structure of undoped graphene layers is that of a honeycomb lattice of covalent - bond carbon atoms .",
    "one valence electron corresponds to one carbon atom and the structure is composed of two sublattices , labeled by a and b. in the vicinity of the @xmath0 point and in the presence of a potential @xmath1 , the low - energy excitations of the gated graphene monolayer are described by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac equation @xmath2 where the pseudospin matrix @xmath3 has components given by pauli s matrices and @xmath4 is the momentum operator . the  speed of light \" of the system is @xmath5 , i.e. , the fermi velocity ( @xmath6 m / s ) .",

    "the operator @xmath31 or @xmath32 creates or annihilates particles with total energy @xmath33 and incident angle @xmath21 in the left lead at time @xmath27 , which are incident upon the sample .",
    "analogously , we define the creation @xmath34 and annihilation @xmath35 operators for the outgoing single - particle states . considering a particular incident energy @xmath33 and incident angle @xmath36 , the scattering matrix @xmath28 follows from the relation @xmath37 where , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the scattering elements of incidence from the left reservoir and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are those from the right reservoir .",
    "the frequency of the potential modulation is small compared to the characteristic times for traversal and reflection of electrons and the pump is thus adiabatic . in this case",
    "one can employ an instant scattering matrix approach , i.e. @xmath42 depends only parametrically on the time @xmath27 . to realize a quantum pump",
    "one varies simultaneously two system parameters , e.g. @xcite @xmath43 here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are measures for the two time - dependent barrier heights @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , which can be modulated by applying two low - frequency ( @xmath46 ) alternating gate voltages . @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the corresponding oscillating amplitudes with phases @xmath49 ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the static ( equilibrium ) components .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath52 being a function of parameters @xmath53 depends on time .",
    "we suppose an adiabatic quantum pump , i.e. , the external parameter changes so slowly that up to corrections of order @xmath54 ( @xmath55 measures the escape rate ) , we can apply an instant scattering description using the scattering matrix @xmath56 frozen at some time @xmath27 .",
    "usually the varying of the wave is sufficiently smooth on the scale of the dwell time .",
    "and we assume that the amplitude @xmath57 is small enough to keep only the terms linear in @xmath57 in an expansion of the scattering matrix@xcite @xmath58 in the limit of small frequencies the amplitudes @xmath59 can be expressed in terms of parametric derivatives of the on - shell scattering matrix @xmath52 , @xmath60 the expansion , eq .",
    "( 6 ) , is equivalent to the nearest sideband approximation which implies that a scattered electron can absorb or emit only one energy quantum @xmath61 before it leaves the scattering region .    the problem of current noise in a quantum pump is closely connected with the problem of quantization of the charge pumped in one cycle . on the other hand ,",
    "the noise in mesoscopic phase - coherent conductors is interesting in itself because it is very sensitive to quantum mechanical interference effects and can give additional information about the scattering matrix@xcite .",

    "is the fano factor defined by @xmath82 , which characterizes the noise with respect to the poisson processes . the poissonian shot noise in the configuration of a quantum pump is discussed in the appendix b.",

    "the phase difference of the two oscillating gate potentials @xmath86 in the radian unit .",
    "the pc , psn , and fano factor as functions of the incident angle @xmath21 for different fermi energies are shown in fig .",
    "electrons at the fermi levels of the reservoirs are driven to flow in one direction by modulating the two barriers with a phase lag , which results in a dc pc at zero bias .",
    "the direction of the pc can be reversed when a high potential barrier demonstrates stronger transparency than a low one , which results from the klein paradox@xcite .",
    "the psn is nonnegative as it measures the pc - pc correlation flowing in the same direction .",
    "it can be seen that the psn increases when the pc is increased . the poisson shot noise demonstrates the process governed by uncorrelated electrons and barrier gates without conduction structure ( see the apendix b ) . in graphene conductors , quantum states below potential barriers",
    "are hole states .",
    "transmission from electron states outside the potential barriers into the hole states inside the potential barriers is characterized by the klein paradox . for some incident angles and certain potential heights when chirality meets , the potential barrier is transparent . for other situations violating chirality alignment ,",
    "the potential barrier is opaque .",
    "as the ac drivers modulate the potential barriers in time , the transmission is varied and a dc current is pumped from one reservoir to the other .",
    "klein paradox virtually correlates the hole states with the electron states .",
    "therefore , the psn is remarkably enhanced beyond the poisson value , the latter of which indicates uncorrelated transport .",
    "the psn relative to the poisson value measured by the fano factor is presented in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the fano factor is above 1 .",
    "klein paradox induced virtual correlation between electrons and holes enhances the psn beyond the poisson value .",
    "it is also revealed in fig .",
    "2 that the psn and fano factor are extremely large at the incident angle when the pc reverses direction . at those incident angles , the chirality alignment is reversed , which induces extraordinary correlation between electrons and holes in virtual transport processes .",
    "the pc , psn , and fano factor as functions of the fermi energy of the two reservoirs @xmath87 for the incident angle @xmath88 are shown in fig .",
    "the absolute value of the pc is in maximums at transmission peaks of the two - barrier graphene structure . around the transmission peaks ,",
    "the pc reverses direction . in our pumping configuration , @xmath89 .",
    "the right gate opens in advance of the left gate . in quantum pumps constructed by other conductors",
    ", the pc always flows from the right to the left reservoir at the @xmath89 phase lag . as a result of the klein paradox ,",
    "higher potential barrier demonstrates stronger transmission when the chirality alignment meets and the pc reverses direction .",
    "the chirality consistency favoring transmission is different between the incident energy above and below the peak energy . when the fermi energy is smaller than the dirac point 100 mev , above the peak energy , higher potential barrier demonstrates stronger transmission and the pc flows from the left reservoir to the right . below the peak energy ,",
    "higher potential barrier demonstrates weaker transmission and the pc flows from the right reservoir to the left .",
    "when the fermi energy is larger than the dirac point , the pc direction is reversed as the transmission configuration is reversed .",
    "larger pcs have relatively stronger current - current correlation .",
    "the shot noise demonstrates peaks at the pc peaks as shown in fig .",
    "the shot noise is positive since the rightward current flow correlates with the rightward current flow and vice versa .",
    "the fano factor is above 1 due to the klein paradox induced virtual correlation between electrons and holes . at energies",
    "when the pc reverses direction , the shot noise is extraordinarily enhanced beyond the poisson value . at those energies , the chirality alignment is reversed , which induces extraordinary correlation between electrons and holes in virtual transport processes .",
    "the pc , psn , and the fano factor as functions of the driving phase difference are shown in fig .",
    "the pc varies with the driving phase @xmath90 in sinusoidal function and the psn in cosinusoidal function , which can be already seen in eqs . (",
    "11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "the last term of eq . ( 11 ) is a product of four pumping amplitudes , four derivatives of the scattering - matrix elements relative to the oscillating parameter , and a @xmath91 function .",
    "as small pumping amplitudes are considered in our approach , the magnitude of this term is negligible .",
    "therefore , the psn is a function of @xmath92 and no @xmath91-form modulation is observable . from fig .",
    "4 ( c ) we can see that for all the fermi energies considered the fano factor varies with @xmath90 in similar forms . when the fermi energy @xmath33 and the incident angle @xmath21 are fixed , the transmission features of the conducting structure are fixed .",
    "the variation of the pumping phase lag would not change the transmission features .",
    "for all fermi energies and incident angles , the pumping properties as functions of the driving phase difference are similar . for configurations of @xmath33 and @xmath21 that higher potential barriers have stronger",
    "transmission , the pc and fano factor are positive at @xmath93 $ ] and negative at @xmath94 $ ] . and for configurations of @xmath33 and @xmath21 that lower potential barriers have stronger transmission , the sign of the pc and fano factor is reversed . at the phase lag @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ,",
    "the pc changes direction as a result of the swap of the opening order of the two gates .",
    "when the pc changes direction , interaction of electrons and holes in virtual processes is enhanced and the fano factor demonstrates a sharp rise .",
    "in summary , the psn properties in adiabatically modulated graphene - based double - barrier structures are investigated . within the scattering - matrix framework ,",
    "general expressions for adiabatically psn in phase - coherent mesoscopic conductors are derived . in comparison with uncorrelated poisson processes ,",
    "numerical results of the pc , psn , and fano factor as functions of the incident angle , the fermi energy of the reservoirs , and the phase difference of the two oscillating parameters are presented .",
    "it is revealed that the psn is greatly enhanced beyond the poisson process due to interactions of electrons and holes in klein - type virtual tunneling processes . in particular , the psn is dramatically enhanced at the energy and incident angle configuration with which the dc pumped current changes flow direction .",
