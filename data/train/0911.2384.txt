    "honeycomb arrays were introduced by golomb and taylor  @xcite in 1984 , as a hexagonal analogue of costas arrays .",
    "examples of honeycomb arrays are given in figures  [ honey137_figure ] to  [ honey45_figure ] below .",
    "a honeycomb array is a collection of @xmath0 dots in a hexagonal array with two properties :    * * ( the hexagonal permutation property ) * there are three natural directions in a hexagonal grid ( see figure  [ fig : lee_example ] ) . considering ` rows ' in each of these three directions ,",
    "the dots occupy @xmath0 consecutive rows , with exactly one dot in each row . * * ( the distinct differences property ) * the @xmath1 vector differences between pairs of distinct dots are all different .",
    "golomb and taylor found @xmath2 examples of honeycomb arrays ( up to symmetry ) , and conjectured that infinite families of honeycomb arrays exist .",
    "blackburn , etzion , martin and paterson  @xcite recently disproved this conjecture : there are only a finite number of honeycomb arrays .",
    "unfortunately , the bound on the maximal size of a honeycomb array that blackburn et al .",
    "provide is far too large to enable an exhaustive computer search over all open cases . in this paper",
    ", we prove a theorem that significantly limits the possibilities for a honeycomb array with @xmath0 dots .",
    "( in particular , we show that @xmath0 must be odd . )",
    "we report on our computer searches for honeycomb arrays , and give two previously unknown examples with @xmath3 dots .",
    "we now introduce a little more notation , so that we can state the main result of our paper more precisely .",
    "we say that a collection of dots in the hexagonal grid is a _",
    "hexagonal permutation _ if it satisfies the hexagonal permutation property .",
    "a collection of dots is a _",
    "distinct difference configuration _ if it satisfies the distinct difference property .",
    "so a honeycomb array is a hexagonal permutation that is a distinct difference configuration .",
    "we say that hexagons are _ adjacent _ if they share an edge , and we say that two hexagons @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ at distance @xmath6 _ if the shortest path from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( travelling along adjacent hexagons ) has length @xmath6 .",
    "lee sphere of radius @xmath7 _ is a region of the hexagonal grid consisting of all hexagons at distance @xmath7 or less from a fixed hexagon ( the _ centre _ of the sphere ) .",
    "the region in figure  [ fig : lee_example ] is a lee sphere of radius @xmath8 .",
    "note that a lee sphere of radius @xmath7 intersects exactly @xmath9 rows in each of the three natural directions in the grid .",
    "a _ honeycomb array of radius @xmath7 _ is a honeycomb array with @xmath9 dots contained in a lee sphere of radius @xmath7 .",
    "there are many other natural regions of the hexagonal grid that have the property that they intersect @xmath0 rows in each direction .",
    "one example , the tricentred lee sphere of radius @xmath7 , is shown in figure  [ fig : tricentred_example ] : it is the union of three lee spheres of radius @xmath7 with pairwise adjacent centres , and intersects exactly @xmath10 rows in any direction .",
    "does there exist a honeycomb array with @xmath10 dots contained in a tricentred lee sphere of radius  @xmath7 ?",
    "golomb and taylor did not find any such examples : they commented  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page  1156 ) that all known examples of honeycomb arrays with @xmath0 dots were in fact honeycomb arrays of radius @xmath7 , but stated `` we have not proved that this must always be the case '' .",
    "we prove the following :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath0 be an integer , and suppose there exists a hexagonal permutation @xmath11 with @xmath0 dots .",
    "then @xmath0 is odd , and the dots of @xmath11 are contained in a lee sphere of radius @xmath12 .",
    "since any honeycomb array is a hexagonal permutation , the following result follows immediately from theorem  [ thm : main ] :    [ cor : honeycomb ] any honeycomb array is a honeycomb array of radius @xmath7 for some integer @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , a honeycomb array must consist of an odd number of dots .",
    "so if we are looking for honeycomb arrays , we may restrict ourselves to searching for honeycomb arrays of radius @xmath7 .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : anticodes ] , we state the results on the hexagonal grid that we need . in section",
    "[ sec : brooks ] , we remind the reader of the notion of a brook , or bee - rook , and state a theorem on the maximum number of non - attacking brooks on a triangular board . in section  [ sec : honeycomb ] we prove theorem  [ thm : main ] , we summarise our computer searches for honeycomb arrays , and we provide a list of all known arrays .",
    "this last section also contains a conjecture , and some suggestions for further work .",
    "because the hexagonal grid might be difficult to visualise , we use an equivalent representation in the square grid ( see figure  [ fig : hex_to_square ] ) . in this representation",
    ", we define each square to be adjacent to the four squares it shares an edge with , and the squares sharing its ` north - east ' and ` south - west ' corner vertices .",
    "the map @xmath13 in figure  [ fig : hex_to_square ] distorts the centres of the hexagons in the hexagonal grid to the centres of the squares in the square grid .",
    "the three types of rows in the hexagonal grid become the rows , the columns and the diagonals that run from north - east to south - west . for brevity",
    ", we define a _ standard diagonal _ to mean a diagonal that runs north - east to south - west .",
