    "the important role played by plasma flows for the reduction of energy transport in tokamak regimes of enhanced confinement is now widely acknowledged . of particular interest for the improved confinement regimes",
    "are the nonlinearly self - generated zonal flows  @xcite .",
    "these are radially localized and strongly sheared flows in the poloidal direction . in experiments , zonal flow levels above the neoclassical prediction has been observed in connection with transport barriers  @xcite in the edge ( h - mode barrier ) and core ( internal transport barriers ) regions . due to the strong shear stabilization of the driving instabilities associated with these flows , they are crucial for the dynamical self - regulation and saturation of the underlying turbulence and anomalous transport fluxes  @xcite . theoretically , the generation and evolution of zonal flows due to drift mode turbulence has been extensively studied in recent years , both analytically  @xcite -  @xcite and in computer simulations using gyrokinetic  @xcite -  @xcite and advanced fluid models  @xcite -  @xcite . in particular , the gyrokinetic simulations of itg mode turbulence reported in the cyclone work ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that there is a strong excitation of zonal flows close to marginal stability where the non - linearly generated flows were able to damp out the turbulence resulting in a non - linear up - shift in the critical temperature gradient needed to obtain transport for longer time scales .    in the present paper ,",
    "the excitation of zonal flows by toroidal ion - temperature gradient ( itg ) turbulence is studied analytically .",
    "a system of equations is derived which describes the coupling between the background itg turbulence and the zonal flow modes .",
    "the model used is an advanced fluid model for itg modes  @xcite including effects of elongated flux surfaces .",
    "previous work using this model indicates that the itg growth is rather insensitive to the shape of the flux surface  @xcite -  @xcite . the analytical technique used here",
    "closely follow ref .",

    "the present work extends the previous study by studying effects of non circular geometry on the zonal flow growth rate .",
    "the result is an analytical expression for the growth rate of the zonal flow instability in elongated equilibria .",
    "the scaling of the zonal flow growth rate with plasma parameters is investigated .",
    "in particular , the role of plasma elongation on the generation of zonal flow is examined .",
    "a resonance in the zonal flow excitation level is found close to marginal stability , consistent with the cyclone work  @xcite .",
    "for peaked density profiles ( small @xmath0 ) , there is a substantially increased excitation of zonal flow when the elongation is increased whereas for most other cases the effects of elongation are weak .",
    "moreover , the zonal flow excitation grows linearly with the wavenumber for zero collisional damping whereas for non - zero damping the zonal flow excitation is significantly reduced .",
