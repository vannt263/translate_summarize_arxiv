    "<S> we develop diagnostic tools that would provide incontrovertible evidence for the presence of more than one higgs boson near 125 gev in the lhc data .    data from the atlas and cms collaborations  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite provide an essentially @xmath0 signal for a higgs - like resonance with mass of order @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the cdf and d0 experiments have announced new results @xcite , based mainly on @xmath2 associated production with @xmath3 , that support the @xmath4 higgs - like signal . </S>",
    "<S> while it is certainly possible that the observed signals in the various production / decay channels will converge towards their respective standard model ( sm ) values , the current central values for these channels deviate by about 12@xmath5 from sm predictions . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , a prime goal of future lhc data taking will be increased statistics , sufficient to clearly rule out or confirm a sm nature for this higgs - like signal . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , it is very interesting to discuss models in which the observed central values for the various channels deviate from the sm along the lines seen in the data .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most significant deviations in the current data is the enhancement in the @xmath6 final state for both gluon fusion ( @xmath7 ) and vector boson fusion ( vbf ) production . </S>",
    "<S> such enhancement can be obtained in a variety of models and is often associated with the observed mass eigenstate at @xmath4 mixing with a nearby ( unobserved or degenerate ) state . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly appealing supersymmetric model that easily obtains both a higgs mass of order @xmath8 and significant @xmath6 mode enhancements is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nmssm is very attractive since it solves the @xmath9 problem of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) : the ad hoc parameter @xmath9 appearing in the mssm superpotential term @xmath10 is automatically generated in the nmssm from the @xmath11 superpotential term when the scalar component @xmath12 of @xmath13 develops a vev @xmath14 : @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the three cp - even higgs fields , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath12 mix and yield the mass eigenstates @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . a @xmath8 higgs state with enhanced @xmath6 signal rate </S>",
    "<S> is easily obtained for large @xmath21 and small @xmath22  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are typically close in mass in this case , with one of them being primarily the doublet - like @xmath16 while the other has a large singlet @xmath12 component . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly interesting case arises when the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are nearly degenerate  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given this latter possibility , a very crucial issue is how to determine whether or not there are two ( or more ) higgs bosons versus just one contributing to the higgs signals at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility , requiring high statistics given the experimental resolution ( of order @xmath23 ) , is that the mass peaks in the @xmath6 and @xmath24 final states would display a structure of two overlapping peaks . </S>",
    "<S> however , for many of the degenerate scenarios it turns out that the @xmath6 and @xmath24 final states are dominated by only one of the degenerate higgses , and the other one would show up primarily in @xmath25 and/or @xmath26 final states . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , mass resolutions in these channels are very poor and detection of a two peak structure using invariant mass distributions would appear to be very difficult . </S>",
    "<S> a direct probe of this kind of degeneracy using the full complement of final states is clearly highly desirable .    in this letter , we therefore develop diagnostic tools that would reveal the presence of two higgs bosons even if they are extremely close in mass . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our technique using the nmssm scenarios generated for @xcite ( where nmssm parameter ranges and all constraints are discussed in detail ) in which the two lightest cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , both lie in the @xmath1 mass window . </S>",
    "<S> the diagnostic tools we suggest are however fully general and can be employed for any model / scenario with degenerate higgs - like states ; to exemplify we comment via footnotes regarding differences and similarities relative to the brane model studied in @xcite in which a higgs and the radion mix to form two mass eigenstates , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( or vice versa ) with @xmath29 .    the main production channels ( denoted by @xmath30 ) relevant for current lhc data are @xmath31 fusion ( @xmath32 ) and vector boson fusion ( @xmath30=vbf ) , where vbf stands for the sum of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 vector boson fusion processes . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath35 stands for a generic higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> higgs decay channels ( denoted by @xmath36 ) include the high resolution @xmath37 and @xmath38 final states , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the poor mass resolution @xmath41 and @xmath42 channels . </S>",
    "<S> the most crucial production / decay channels at the lhc are @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the lhc also probes @xmath44 ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) with @xmath47 , channels for which tevatron data is relevant , and @xmath48 with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> let us employ the notation @xmath50 for the @xmath51 scalar higgs , @xmath52 for the sm higgs boson and @xmath53 is the ratio of the @xmath54 coupling to the @xmath55 coupling , where @xmath56 are the cases of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the @xmath7 or vbf induced @xmath50 cross section times @xmath57 , relative to the corresponding value for the sm higgs boson , takes the form r^h_i_gg(x)=(c_gg^h_i)^2  ( h_ix ) ( x ) , r^h_i_vbf(x)=(c_ww^h_i)^2  ( h_ix ) ( x ) , [ rdefs ] where the latter result assumes the custodial symmetry relation @xmath58 as applies in any doublets+singlets model ; this latter also implies @xmath59 and , for either @xmath32 or @xmath60vbf , @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if custodial symmetry is broken there are many more independent @xmath62 s . , @xmath63 , ]    in this letter we consider the case where there are two nearly degenerate higgs bosons for which we must combine their signals . </S>",
    "<S> the net signal and the effective higgs mass , respectively , for given production and final decay channels @xmath30 and @xmath36 , respectively , are computed as r^h_y(x)=r^_y(x)+ r^_y(x ) , m_h^y(x ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the extent to which it is appropriate to combine the rates from the @xmath18 and @xmath19 depends upon the degree of degeneracy and the experimental resolution , estimated to be of order @xmath64  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the widths of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are of the same order of magnitude as the width of a 125  gev sm higgs boson ( a few mev ) ,  very much smaller than this resolution . </S>",
    "<S> and @xmath65 modes is even _ </S>",
    "<S> visible _ at the lhc tells us that the widths of any contributing higgs boson must be very small , at most of order a few mev as for the sm higgs . </S>",
    "<S> interference effects are negligible in this case unless one has extreme degeneracy of the two states . </S>",
    "<S> our nmssm scan points generally have @xmath66 mev for which interference effects are at most a fraction of a percent . ]    </S>",
    "<S> as already noted , in the context of any doublets plus singlets model not all the @xmath62 s are independent ; the relations among the @xmath62 s were noted above . in supersymmetric two - doublet plus singlets models we have in addition @xmath67 . a complete independent set of @xmath68 s </S>",
    "<S> can be taken to be : s could be independent and more ( or fewer ) double ratios compared to those defined below could be useful / independent . in the higgs - radion mixing model custodial symmetry is violated , leading to _ more _ independent @xmath68 s . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] ] , , , , , . </S>",
    "<S> let us now look in more detail at a given @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> it takes the form r^h_y(x)=_i=1,2 ( c^h_i_y)^2 ( c^h_i_x)^2c^h_i _ [ rsum ] where @xmath72 for @xmath73 is the ratio of the @xmath74 to @xmath75 coupling , as defined above eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rdefs ] ) , and @xmath76 is the ratio of the total width of the @xmath50 to the sm higgs total width . the diagnostic tools that we propose to reveal the existence of a second , quasi - degenerate ( but non - interfering in the small width approximation ) higgs state are the double ratios :  // ,  // ,  // , [ doublerr ] each of which should be unity if only a single higgs boson is present but , due to the non - factorizing nature of the sum in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rsum ] ) , are generally expected to deviate from 1 if two ( or more ) higgs bosons are contributing to the net @xmath77 signals . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because the @xmath18 and @xmath19 will in general have different relative production rates in the vbf and gg fusion channels for one or more final states . </S>",
    "<S> one can check that in a doublets+singlets model all other double ratios that are equal to unity for single higgs exchange are not independent of the above three . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the above three double ratios are not all independent . which will be most useful depends upon the precision with which the @xmath68 s for different initial / final states can be measured . </S>",
    "<S> for example , measurements of @xmath68 for the @xmath78 final state may continue to be somewhat imprecise and it is then double ratio ii ) that might prove most discriminating . or , it could be that one of the double ratios deviates from unity by a much larger amount than the others , in which case it might be most discriminating even if the @xmath68 s involved are not measured with great precision .    to explore </S>",
    "<S> how powerful these double ratios are in practice , we turn to the nmssm scenarios with semi - unified gut scale soft - susy - breaking sampled in @xcite . , scalar ( sfermion ) mass parameter @xmath79 , and trilinear coupling @xmath80 at the gut scale , but @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 as well as @xmath84 and @xmath85 are taken as non - universal at @xmath86 . ] </S>",
    "<S> these scenarios obey all experimental constraints ( including @xmath87 and 2011 xenon100 limits on the spin - independent scattering cross section ) except that the susy contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath88 , is too small to explain the discrepancy between the observed value @xmath89 and that predicted by the sm . </S>",
    "<S> for a full discussion of the kind of nmssm model employed see also  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plots1 ] , we plot the numerator versus the denominator of the double ratios i ) and ii ) , iii ) being very like i ) due to the correlation between the @xmath90 and @xmath91 values discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that any one of these double ratios will often , but not always , deviate from unity ( the diagonal dashed line in the figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of such deviation increases dramatically if we require ( as apparently preferred by lhc data ) @xmath92 , see the solid ( vs.  open ) symbols of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plots1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is further elucidated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plots2 ] where we display the double ratios i ) and ii ) as functions of @xmath93 ( left plots ) . for the nmssm </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that the double ratio i ) provides the greatest discrimination between degenerate vs.  non - degenerate scenarios with values very substantially different from unity ( the dashed line ) for the majority of the degenerate nmssm scenarios explored in @xcite that have enhanced @xmath6 rates . </S>",
    "<S> note in particular that i ) , being sensitive to the @xmath25 final state , singles out degenerate higgs scenarios even when one or the other of @xmath18 or @xmath19 dominates the @xmath94 rate , see the top right plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plots2 ] . in comparison , double ratio ii ) is most useful for scenarios with @xmath95 , as illustrated by the bottom left plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plots2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as illustrated by the bottom right plot of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> obviously , current statistics are inadequate to discriminate whether or not the double ratios deviate from unity . for a @xmath107 run with @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) of accumulated luminosity the sm higgs cross sections at the relevant energies </S>",
    "<S> imply that the number of higgs events will be about a factor of 25 ( 77 ) larger than the number produced for @xmath110 at @xmath111 plus @xmath112 at @xmath113 ( as used in computing the error bars shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> only that means the error bars plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plots1 ] should be reduced by roughly a factor of 5 ( 9 ) , levels that could indeed reveal a deviation from unity , or at least remove some model points if no deviation within that error is seen . of course improvements in the experimental analyses </S>",
    "<S> may further increase the sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that our diagnostic tools will ultimately prove viable and perhaps crucial for determining if the @xmath4 higgs signal is really only due to a single higgs - like resonance or if two resonances are contributing , the latter having significant probability in model contexts if enhanced @xmath6 rates are indeed confirmed at higher statistics .    * to summarize * , we have emphasized the possibility that a @xmath6 higgs - like signal that is significantly enhanced relative to the sm could arise as a result of there being two fairly degenerate higgs bosons near 125  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this situation arises in several model contexts in which the degeneracy can be such that separate mass peaks could not be observed in even the high - resolution @xmath6 and @xmath114 final states . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that deviations from unity of certain double ratios of event rates have strong potential for revealing the presence of two ( or more ) nearly degenerate higgs bosons within the @xmath8 lhc signal . </S>",
    "<S> such deviations arise when both the quasi - degenerate higgses contribute significantly to at least one production / decay channel . </S>",
    "<S> we have employed the nmssm as a prototype model to illustrate the discriminating power of these double ratios in the case of a doublets - plus - singlets higgs model . </S>",
    "<S> we have also noted that the diagnostic power of the double ratios discussed in this letter is at least as great in the brane model with higgs - radion mixing and , in addition , there are more double ratios that can be defined as a result of the sometimes substantial violation of custodial symmetry in the latter type of model . </S>",
    "<S> of course , substantial statistics will be required to reveal the deviations from unity that would signal a degenerate scenario . </S>"
