    "phenix have done a detailed mapping of the two - particle correlations in centrality , @xmath1 and particle types  @xcite .",
    "non - trivial modifications relative to p - p of the correlation patterns are observed in the trigger @xmath1 ( @xmath6 ) and partner @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) below 4 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "there are strong evidences suggesting that the @xmath1 dependence of the jet shape at the near- and away - side is a consequence of the detailed interplay between jet - quenching and response of the medium to the energy lost by energetic jets  @xcite .",
    "additional complication ( only for jet yield ) can be traced back to the soft contribution to the triggers , which are used to normalize jet pair rate into per - trigger yield ( @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "for example , imagine we try to correlate hadrons in 2 - 3 gev/@xmath4 ( @xmath9 ) with those 5 - 10 gev/@xmath4 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "since @xmath11 , arguably due to recombination contribution , one expects @xmath12 ( ratio of @xmath8 in a+a to that in p+p ) for using @xmath9 as trigger and @xmath10 as partner is lower than the other way around  @xcite .",
    "note @xmath12 is function of trigger and partner @xmath1 : @xmath13 . ] .    in this analysis",
    ", we present results using high @xmath1 @xmath2 as triggers .",
    "these triggers comes dominantly from jet fragmentation , thus provide a cleaner physical interpretation of the per - trigger yield . in terms of @xmath14 , cu+cu collisions cover from peripheral to 30 - 40% central au+au collisions .",
    "@xmath14 can be determined with better precision that in au+au , thus allows a more detailed mapping of the centrality dependence of the onset of the jet quenching .",
    "additionally , systematic error from on the jet yield due to elliptic flow is much more reduced in cu+cu due to a smaller combinatoric background level .",
    "the measurement was carried with 5 - 10 gev/@xmath4 @xmath2 as triggers and charged hadrons in several ranges in 0.4 - 10 gev/@xmath4 as partners .",
    "the per - trigger jet yield is obtained via  @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of triggers , @xmath17 is the single particle efficiency for partners in the full azimuth and @xmath18 ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are pair distributions from the same- and mixed - events , respectively .",
    "mixed - event pairs are obtained by selecting partners from different events with similar centrality and vertex .",
    "the @xmath17 values include detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiency , with an uncertainty of @xmath21% , evaluated similar to  @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 is a normalization factor which is the ratio of the combinatorics pairs in the same event to those in the mixed event .",
    "@xmath22 is typically bigger but very close to 1 .",
    "fig.[fig : cucucf ] show the correlation function , @xmath23 , in 0 - 20% cu+cu compared with that in p+p .",
    "a clear away - side excess can be seen in all partner @xmath1 ranges .",
    "no concave shape is expected even after the @xmath24 background subtraction . at partner @xmath25 gev/@xmath4 ,",
    "the away - side can be well described by a gauss function .",
    "fig.[fig : cucuwidth ] shows the near - side and away - side jet width as function of partner @xmath1 for p+p , 0 - 20% and 20 - 40% cu+cu collisions .",
    "no significant differences can be seen between cu+cu and p+p within systematic errors , suggesting partners come mostly from jet fragmentation in the @xmath1 range under consideration ( @xmath26 gev/@xmath4 at the near side and @xmath272 gev/@xmath4 at the away side ) .    comparing the top and the bottom panels of fig.[fig : cucucf ] ,",
    "one notices that there is a larger asymmetry between the near- and away - side in cu+cu than that in p+p . to quantify the medium modifications",
    ", we extract the @xmath8 for cu+cu and p+p and construct the @xmath12 as function of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the results for 0 - 20% central cu+cu collisions are shown in left panel of fig.[fig : xe ] .",
    "@xmath12 at the near side is consistent with 1 in the full @xmath28 range of 0.1 - 1.4 ; the away - side @xmath12 starts at slightly above 1 at small @xmath28 , and gradually decreases towards larger @xmath28 , at @xmath30 the suppression value approaches a constant of 0.5 up to @xmath31 .",
    "this constant behavior is also seen by star in au+au collisions  @xcite , where the level of suppression was found to be similar to single particle @xmath32 .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : xe ] shows the integrated @xmath12 in @xmath33 as function @xmath14 , comparing with the integrated @xmath32 for the single particle . assuming @xmath34 for leading @xmath2s , the @xmath1 of the original jets should be around 5/0.7=7 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "thus the @xmath12 of the away - side should be directly comparable to the single particle at @xmath35 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "in reality , since the @xmath2 @xmath32 is flat at @xmath36 gev/@xmath4 , the exact values of the energy of the jets for high @xmath1 @xmath2s are not important .",
    "fig.[fig : xe]b indicates that the near - side @xmath12 is around one in all centralities , consistent with surface emission picture .",
    "in contrast , away - side @xmath12 shows a suppression that has a similar centrality dependence in @xmath14 relative to single particle suppression .",
    "this is rather surprising given that the away - side jet travels more medium than the single particles in the naive jet absorption picture  @xcite . suggesting that the simple geometrical bias argument is too naive . in jet quenching picture ,",
    "the suppression is due to the energy degradation of the high @xmath1 jets .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath32 depends on both the energy loss as well as on the input parton spectra shape . for the single particle ,",
    "the expected @xmath37 scaled p+p spectra have a typical power - law shape with a power of 8 . in the di - hadron correlation ,",
    "the away - side spectra associated with the leading particles have much flatter distribution with a much smaller power .",
    "thus for the same amount of energy loss for single jet and away - side jet , the suppression level observed for @xmath12 could be smaller than the that for @xmath32 .",
    "to illustrate this idea , we follow the prescription in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the fractional energy loss @xmath38 is related to @xmath32 as : @xmath39 the power `` n '' is @xmath40 for single particle spectra in @xmath41 .",
    "the power for the away - side associated spectra can be determined from run5 @xmath42 data in fig.[fig : pp ] ( see also run3 p+p data results  @xcite ) via a modified power - law fit : @xmath43 .",
    "the power n is found to be about 4.8 .",
    "if we assume the away - side jet have same fraction energy loss as single particles , we have : @xmath44 @xmath45 in central au+au collisions would lead to @xmath46 , indicating a much smaller suppression than that for @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we require @xmath47 , then the away hadron energy loss fraction would be @xmath48 , much bigger than the single hadron energy loss fraction @xmath49 , as expected ( about 50% more energy loss ) .",
    "if we apply this trick to central cu+cu collisions , and assumes @xmath50 , the fractional energy loss for away - side jet would be @xmath51 .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the value for inclusive hadrons of @xmath52 .    in summary ,",
    "high @xmath1 @xmath53 correlations are studied in cu+cu and p+p collisions .",
    "clear , relatively unmodified jet peaks are seen in rather low partner @xmath1 in central cu+cu collisions , albeit suppressed by factor of 2 that is similar to that for inclusive hadrons .",
    "these observations suggest that the high @xmath1 correlation is dominated by fragmentation of the jet that survives the medium .",
    "the similar suppression level observed for @xmath12 relative to @xmath32 is the combined results of a larger energy loss and a flatter parton spectra .",
