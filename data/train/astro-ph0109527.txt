    "it is interesting for a number of reasons , including : i ) radio `` hot spots '' , the shocked jet material at the termini of the jets , were first observed in cygnus a ( hargrave & ryle 1974 ) ; ii ) the galaxy may be at the center of a cooling flow in a cluster of galaxies ( arnaud et al .",

    "chandra _ x - ray observations of the nucleus and circumnuclear environment of cygnus a.    in the past there has been debate concerning the nature of the nucleus and circumnuclear regions ( approximately the central @xmath27 [ 6 kpc ] ) of cygnus a , in particular the central bi - polar optical morphology .",
    "suggested explanations have included i ) the merger of two galaxies ( baade & minkowski 1954 ) , ii ) the intersection of a single galaxy by a dust lane ( osterbrock 1983 ) , or iii ) a bi - polar scattering nebula ( see e.g. stockton , ridgway & lilly 1994 ) . the presently favored model is that at least some of the central optical morphology results from scattering of light from a hidden nucleus located at the radio core . in the following paragraphs we summarize the key observations of the nucleus and nuclear environment at radio , x - ray , infrared , optical and ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "radio observations with the vla at 6 cm wavelength with 04 resolution ( perley , dreher & cowan 1984 ) show a compact radio core with a knotty , one - sided jet running along position angle ( pa ) @xmath28 from @xmath29  25 .",
    "higher resolution vlbi observations show a `` core '' with a pc - scale jet that is aligned with the kpc - scale jet to within @xmath30 ( carilli , bartel & linfield 1991 )",
    ".    near - infrared imaging shows an unresolved nucleus , within 1  of the radio core , and suggested to be obscured by @xmath31 magnitudes of extinction ( djorgovski et al .",

    ", these authors estimate an extinction @xmath33 mag to the broad line region .",
    "a similar relationship between x - ray luminosity and near infrared luminosity , along with an assumption about the spectral slope of the nuclear spectrum , implies an extinction of @xmath34 mag to the nuclear continuum source ( ward et al .",
    "a more recent study suggests @xmath35  200 mag to the nucleus ( ward 1996 ) . for a standard dust to gas ratio @xmath36",

    "a , there is an optical source with a bi - polar morphology , the northwest component being dominated by line emission and the southeast component being dominated by continuum emission ( see , e.g. stockton et al .",
    "1994 ) . in an hst v band image ( jackson et al .",
    "1996 ) the central component resembles the apex of a conical structure similar to that seen in other galaxies and attributed to light from a hidden nucleus escaping along a restricted range of solid angle , i.e. an `` ionization cone '' .",
    "ultraviolet observations with the hst fos by antonucci , hurt & kinney ( 1994 ) show noisy , broad [ ] with a fwhm @xmath39 , which is suggestive of a hidden broad line region .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopic observations using keck ii ( ogle et al .",
    "1997 ) show polarized continuum and broad balmer line emission , with the continuum polarization in the northwest component rising to @xmath40 16% at 3800 .",
    "the polarized light comes from a bi - conical structure with an opening half - angle in the range @xmath41  @xmath42 , corresponding to the `` ionization cone '' seen with hst .",
    "the symmetry of the polarization vectors indicates that this light originated in the nucleus and has been scattered into our line of sight .",
    "cygnus a is surrounded by cluster gas and this makes a determination of the x - ray spectrum of the nucleus difficult .",
    "the findings of previous x - ray studies of the nucleus and cluster gas of cygnus a are summarized in table  [ tab : previous_xray ] .",
    "the detection of a hard power - law is compelling evidence for a hidden active nucleus or quasar in the nucleus of cygnus a and the values found for the intrinsic column density are typical of seyfert 2 galaxies ( awaki et al .",
    "1991 ; smith & done 1996 ; turner et al .",
    "also , arnaud ( 1996 ) showed that the hard x - rays come from a point source within 30  of the radio core .    in this paper , we focus on _ chandra _ x - ray observations of the nucleus of cygnus a. our results on the x - ray emission from the radio hot spots and the intra - cluster gas",

    "the luminosity and `` angular size '' distances to cygnus a are then 346.4 mpc and 310.6 mpc , respectively , and 1corresponds to 1.51 kpc .",
    "the nucleus of cygnus a is known to be a strong x - ray source , and we were concerned that `` pile - up '' would affect the _ chandra _ observations . in order to obtain the count rate of the nucleus and circumnuclear regions , we first obtained a short observation ( obs i d 359 ) of cygnus a on 2000 march 8 using chip s3 ( backside illuminated ) of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al .",
    "single exposures with a 0.1  s frame - time were alternated with two exposures with a 0.4  s frame - time , the total integration time being @xmath45 ks .",
    "this observation showed the nucleus was not significantly piled - up in either the 0.1  s or 0.4  s frame - time , but the observed count - rate indicated that a 3.2  s frame - time observation of the nucleus would suffer from significant pile - up . on this basis , we decided to observe cygnus a for separate , longer exposures with frame - times of 0.4  s and 3.2  s , which were designed to study primarily the x - ray emission of the nucleus and the larger scale regions , respectively . the resulting level 1 and level 2 peak count rates in the long exposure 3.2  s frame - time observation ( see below ) are 0.0425 and 0.0286 cts pixel@xmath3 s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "thus only 67% of the events were good grades , a clear indication of pile - up .",
    "in contrast , the level 2 and level 1 peak count rates in the long 0.4  s frame - time exposure are 0.053 and 0.056 cts pixel@xmath3 s@xmath3 , respectively , indicating about 94% good grades .",
    "the higher count rate in the 0.4  s than the 3.2  s frame - time is also an indicator of pile - up in the 3.2  s frame - time observation .",
    "these longer integrations were taken with the acis instrument in two separate observations . on 2000",
    "may 21 ( obs i d 360 ) the standard 3.2  s frame - time was used .",
    "ccds i2 , i3 , s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 were read out , though most of the x - ray emission from cygnus a is on s3 . on 2000",
    "may 26 ( obs i d 1707 ) a sub - array window 128 pixels wide on the s3 chip was used with a 0.4  s frame - time to mitigate the effects of pile - up in the inner regions , as discussed above .",
    "both exposures were taken with cygnus a at the aim - point of the s3 chip .",
    "the data were screened in the usual way for times of high background count rates and aspect errors . the 3.2  s and 0.4  s frame - time data have total good exposure times of 34720  s and 9227  s respectively .",
    "spectra and instrument responses were generated using ciao 2.1 ( with reprocessed data ) and caldb 2.3 , and analyzed with xspec v11.0.1 .",
    "response is not reliable below 0.45 kev , although the backside - illuminated s3 chip has good sensitivity to x - rays down to 0.1 kev . to improve the sampling of the x - ray images , we interpolated the data from the original @xmath46 to @xmath47-sized pixels and then smoothed the resulting image with a gaussian of fwhm @xmath46 .",
    "cygnus a was also observed using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) on may 20 , 2000 .",
    "data were gathered using the proportional counter array ( pca ) and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) .",
    "two pca counters ( pcu0 and pcu2 ) were operating at the time of the observation , but pcu0 had suffered the loss of its propane layer one week earlier . because a good background subtraction model is not yet available for pcu0 in this new state we have restricted our analysis to pcu2 .",
    "we used the standard rex script to generate pca and hexte light curves , source and background spectra , and response matrices .",

    "background counts were extracted from a concentric annulus with an inner diameter 7  and outer diameter 20 .",
    "the background level is very low and is equivalent to only 43 counts , 1.5% of the total within the 25 diameter circle used for the nucleus .",
    "[ sec : nw_se_nuc ]    in order to investigate the spectrum of the circumnuclear extended regions , we took counts from two sectors of a circle with diameter @xmath51 centered on the nucleus .",
    "the sectors have half - angles of @xmath42 and their axes are aligned with the jet and counter jet . in the 0.4  s frame - time data",
    "there are 3183 counts , corresponding to a count rate of @xmath52 cts s@xmath3 , within these sectors .",
    "background counts were extracted from a concentric annulus with inner diameter @xmath51 and outer diameter @xmath53 .",
    "the background level is equivalent to 224 counts , 8% of the total inside the two sectors .",
    "the source extraction regions contain some flux from the nucleus .",
    "the x - ray morphology within the central @xmath54 around the nucleus varies strongly with photon energy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : collage ] ) . above approximately 2",
    "the nucleus appears to be point - like and coincident with the radio core ( see section  [ sec : x_ray_align ] ) , while below @xmath55 a bi - polar distribution is clearly seen in the higher signal - to - noise ratio 3.2  s frame - time data , with one peak of emission @xmath56 northwest of the nucleus along pa @xmath57 and a second peak @xmath58 southeast of the nucleus along pa @xmath59 .",
    "these are the position angles of the center of the brightest pixels , in the 0.25  1 kev image , to the northwest and southeast relative to the location of the nucleus and determined using the iraf center tool .",
    "the quoted `` error bars '' are the range of position angle given by moving @xmath60 pixels from the peak pixel diagonally ne and sw . the bi - polar distribution is easily seen in a color image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : color ] ) , in which the data were divided into three bands , red representing 0.1  1.275 kev , green 1.275  2.2 kev and blue 2.2  10 kev .",
    "images in the three bands were then combined to give the overall color picture .",
    "the nuclear region has a blue , and hence hard , x - ray point - like core with the two offset regions to the northwest and southeast appearing yellower , indicative of softer x - ray emission .",
    "even though a clear bi - polar morphology is seen , there is also soft x - ray emission close to the nucleus .",
    "a comparatively smooth distribution of hot gas is projected around the nuclear region .",
    "the double morphology may be due , in part , to the presence of a dust lane running n - s across the nucleus obscuring the central @xmath61 of the soft x - ray emission .",
    "the 0.25  1 kev flux per pixel at the location of the nucleus is approximately 40% of that at the peak of the soft x - ray emission some @xmath62 from the nucleus . if the intrinsic luminosity and spectra of these two regions are the same then a modest additional column density of @xmath63 obscuring the nucleus would be sufficient to account for the lower flux at the nucleus .",
    "this column density is consistent with the additional reddening of the nucleus by the dust lane ( shaw & tadhunter 1994 ; tadhunter , metz & robinson 1994 ) , assuming a standard dust to gas ratio .    to determine whether _ chandra _ resolves the point - like , hard x - ray nucleus ,",
    "its radial profile was compared with a model of the point spread function .",
    "it should be noted that on larger spatial scales , significant x - ray emission is observed in the neighborhood of the nucleus .",
    "most of this larger scale emission is thermal in origin with a temperature of 4  5 kev and apparently represents emission from the intracluster gas projected close to the nucleus ( paper iii ) .",
    "this hot plasma has a significant high energy tail so the wings of the psf from the nucleus may merge into the continuum emission from the thermal plasma . to minimize this effect ,",
    "the point spread function was calculated at 8.6 kev where the contribution from the cluster gas is much smaller than at lower energies .",
    "the background level was determined using a circle of radius 225 offset 50  southeast of the nucleus .",
    "radial profiles of the point spread function at 8.6 kev and the observed 7  9 kev counts ( from the 0.4 s frame - time data ) centered on the nucleus are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] .",
    "the hard x - ray nucleus is seen to be unresolved .",
    "the grossly different spatial resolutions of _ chandra _ and _ rxte _ mean that different spectral models have to be fitted to data sets from each observatory . the 25 diameter circle used to extract counts from the _ chandra _ data effectively isolates the nucleus from the surrounding cluster , whereas the @xmath64 resolution of _ rxte _ yields a spectrum that includes the nucleus , features associated with the radio source , and the intra - cluster gas .",
    "chandra _ data show the `` hot spots '' to have @xmath65 of the 7  10 kev flux of the nucleus so flux from the `` hot spots '' will not contribute significantly to the _ rxte _ spectrum .",

    "having obtained the plate solution using the stars , the iraf tool center places the k@xmath120 nucleus at @xmath121 , @xmath122 ( j2000 ) , which is within @xmath118 of the radio core and represents coincidence given the errors .",
    "the nucleus in the r band image is not point - like , so can not be simply aligned with the radio core .",
    "instead , the same offset ( less than @xmath118 ) was applied to the r band image as was applied to the k@xmath120 image .",

    "the bright , extended optical emission correlates well with the extended x - ray emission ( see fig .  [",

    "hst imaging in wavebands containing optical emission lines ( jackson et al . 1994 ; jackson et al 1996 ) reveals three distinct structures in a roughly @xmath123 region around the nucleus .",
    "there are two `` clouds '' , one to the northwest and one to the southeast , and a `` bar '' connecting the s extreme of the northwest cloud to the n extreme of the southeast cloud . in the middle of the `` bar '' there is a bright optical knot at @xmath124 , @xmath125 ( j2000 ) ( jackson et al .",
    "1994 ) , which is within 01 of the radio core .",
    "thus , in aligning the optical , radio and x - ray images , the central optical component in the hst images was assumed to coincide with the radio and x - ray nuclei .",
    "there are bright peaks in [ ] @xmath5 and h@xmath6 + [ ] @xmath7 , 6583 emission coincident with the hard x - ray nucleus , and the northern region of the extended x - ray emission to the northwest ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : hst_oiii ] and [ fig : hst_halpha ] ) . diffuse [ ] line emission is seen from an approximately bi - conical region centered on the nucleus and in this regard the x - ray and [ ] emissions appear well correlated ( as also found in ngc 1068 [ young , wilson & shopbell 2001 ] , where the ionization of the x - ray emitting gas is dominated by photoionization [ paerels et al .",
    "[ sec : hst_align ]",
    "the _ chandra _ observations of the nucleus of cygnus a identify the source of hard x - ray emission with an unresolved point source located within @xmath118 of , and probably coincident with , the radio core . the spectrum of this point source is well described by a power law of photon index @xmath126 , with rest - frame 2  10 kev luminosity ( corrected for absorption ) of @xmath127 obscured by a column density of @xmath128 .",
    "the power law slope has been determined with unprecedented precision for cygnus a , and is at the lower end of the distribution of photon indices for nlrg ( see fig .",

    "the fact that the hard x - ray power law is detected out to 100 kev confirms the similarity to seyferts and quasars .",

    "the x - ray to far infrared luminosity ratio in cygnus a @xmath132 and is similar to qsos ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "the far infrared luminosity was calculated from the _ iras _ fluxes using @xmath133 w m@xmath134 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the flux densities at 60 @xmath137 m and 100 @xmath137 m , respectively , in units of jy .",
    "we attempt to estimate the nuclear optical absolute magnitude which can not be measured directly because of the heavy extinction toward the nucleus .",
    "first , we assume the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of cygnus a is the same as the median sed of radio - loud quasars presented in elvis et al .",

    "@xmath139 correlation for type 1 seyfert galaxies and qsos ( ho & peng 2001 ) , gives @xmath140 .",
    "note , however , that the h@xmath17 luminosities adopted in ho & peng ( 2001 ) are a combination of the broad and narrow components and the broad component dominates in type 1 qsos .",
    "we used only the narrow component of h@xmath17 for cygnus a and therefore this last value of @xmath139 should be regarded as an upper limit ( i.e. a lower limit on the b band luminosity ) .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with the estimate obtained using the sed .      in this section",
    "we discuss the possibility that the extended bi - polar soft x - ray continuum emission to the northwest and southeast of the nucleus is electron - scattered nuclear light .",
    "in such a model the continuum spectrum of the electron - scattered component is identical to that of the nucleus , and the observations are consistent with the directly viewed hard component and the soft component having the same photon index ( i.e. @xmath141 , sections [ sec : nuc_spec ] and [ sec : nw_se_spec ] ) .",
    "an extrapolation of the soft x - ray power law has an unabsorbed rest - frame 2  10 kev luminosity of approximately @xmath142 ( see section [ sec : nw_se_spec ] ) which corresponds to approximately 1% of the unobscured 2  10 kev nuclear luminosity ( @xmath143 ; see section [ sec : nuc_spec ] ) .",
    "this is compatible with the range of scattering fractions inferred in seyfert 2 galaxies , in which typically 0.25  5% of the nuclear light is hypothesized to be scattered into our line of sight ( turner et al .",
    "1997b ) , and less than the 5  10% inferred in those objects exhibiting broad polarized h@xmath6 ( awaki et al .",
    "2000 ) ; of course , there may be , in addition , intrinsically extended thermal emission .",
    "if the x - rays are scattered by an optically thin population of electrons in a bi - conical region , then @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the opening half - angle of the bi - conical region , observed by hst to be @xmath146 . using the luminosities given above , we find an optical depth through one cone of @xmath147 and a column density @xmath148 .",
    "this is significantly higher than both the galactic column density to cygnus a , @xmath149 , and the upper limit to the intrinsic column density to the southeast or northwest regions , @xmath150 ( see section [ sec : column ] ) .",
    "the lack of strong absorption in the _ chandra _ soft x - ray spectrum rules out such a high column of _ cold _ , ionized gas .",
    "as just noted , the observed intrinsic absorbing column density to the soft x - ray emission , assuming the absorbing gas is cold , is @xmath151 ( see above ) , while the column density for the scattering medium is inferred to be much larger , @xmath152 .",
    "this discrepancy may be reconciled if the scattering medium is ionized and hence has a lower opacity to soft x - rays .",
    "ideally , the absorber should be modeled as an ionized gas .",
    "however , we can get an idea of the conditions required by writing @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the absorption cross sections of ionized and cold gas , respectively , and bearing in mind that @xmath156 is a function of energy even for a single ionization parameter for the ionized gas .",
    "the absorbing column intrinsic to cygnus a affects the observed spectrum most in the range @xmath157  1 kev . at just above @xmath158 , @xmath159 ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , and @xmath160 ( krolik & kallman 1984 , their fig .",
    "4 ) for a photoionized gas with an ionization parameter ( taking into account their different definition of the ionization parameter ) of @xmath161 erg cm s@xmath3 , where @xmath162 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei and @xmath163 is the distance from the nucleus .",
    "this ionization parameter corresponds to a plasma temperature of @xmath164 and such a plasma has almost an order of magnitude lower soft x - ray opacity than neutral gas near 0.5 kev .",
    "similarly , at @xmath165 @xmath166 and @xmath167 for a photoionized gas with @xmath168 erg cm s@xmath3 and @xmath169 ( again from krolik & kallman 1984 , their fig .",
    "thus , such a plasma has almost an order of magnitude lower soft x - ray opacity than neutral gas , but this time at 1 kev .",
    "thus a conservative lower limit is @xmath19 erg cm s@xmath3 ; it is a lower limit because there could be _ cold _ gas present with the intrinsic column ( @xmath170 ) and _ zero _ absorption from the scattering column , which would then have to have a very high value of @xmath171 .",
    "the measured unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of the nucleus then implies @xmath172 erg cm s@xmath173 ( taking @xmath174 ) .",
    "the column density of the scattering electrons @xmath175 corresponds to a number density of @xmath176 for the observed @xmath177 kpc .",
    "combining the equations for @xmath178 and @xmath179 we find @xmath180 erg cm s@xmath181 , which agrees with the observed distance of the soft x - ray emission from the nucleus if @xmath182 erg cm s@xmath3 . a low value of @xmath171 is consistent with the low ionization state of the fe k@xmath6 line observed from the nucleus and circumnuclear region ( see tables  [ tab : nuc_lines ] and [ tab : nw_se_lines ] ) .",
    "the presence of highly ionized ne lines in the soft x - ray spectrum may be used to constrain the location of gas emitting those lines . to photoionize ne to and requires @xmath21 erg cm s@xmath3 ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) implying @xmath183 erg cm s@xmath173 . if @xmath184 , we get @xmath185 , substantially smaller than the observed nuclear distance of the soft x - ray peaks ( figs .  [",
    "fig : chandra_6 cm ]    [ fig : hst_halpha ] ) , which are dominated by continuum radiation .",
    "it is possible , however , that @xmath186 may be lower , allowing a larger value of @xmath163 .",
    "this would be the case in a multi - phase gas , e.g. , with warm dense blobs embedded in a hotter less dense gas , which would be responsible for the observed highly ionized line emission .",
    "the nuclear absolute magnitude is estimated by ogle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using the optical polarized flux as @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the absolute magnitude of the polarized flux , @xmath189 is the source covering fraction , @xmath190 is the scattering optical depth , @xmath191 is the intrinsic polarization of the scattered light , and @xmath192 is the extinction .",
    "the observed @xmath193 ( rest b band corrected for galactic extinction , western component only , @xmath194 = 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) , @xmath195% , and @xmath196% ( ogle et al .",
    "1997 ) gives @xmath197 .",
    "our estimation of @xmath198 from the sed and this relation suggest that @xmath190 is order of 1 if the extinction is small .",
    "this @xmath190 is much larger than that estimated from the extended soft x - ray emission if the scattering particles are electrons , suggesting instead that the polarized optical light is scattered by dust , unless the value of @xmath199 for the x - rays is much smaller than we assumed .",
    "the extended , soft x - ray emission may also be described by a thermal bremsstrahlung model ( see table  [ tab : nw_se_spec ] ) . the direct bremsstrahlung emission from a plasma with the density inferred in the scattering model ( @xmath200 ; section [ sec : electron - scattered ] ) would dominate over the scattered flux unless the emitting and scattering medium has a temperature below @xmath201 k , which is significantly lower than that required in the bremsstrahlung model ",
    "an argument against the extended emission being entirely due to a thermal plasma is the extremely low metallicity required to provide a good description of the data .",
    "a bremsstrahlung model has no metal lines and the best fitting mekal model has @xmath22 .",

    "bi - polar soft x - ray emission is observed to extend @xmath56 towards the northwest and southeast of the nucleus of cygnus a , and aligns well with the bi - polar structures seen in optical continuum and line radiation .",
    "the bi - polar morphology may be produced or enhanced by the passage of a dust lane across the nucleus , providing an additional absorbing column density of @xmath209 and suppressing the very soft x - ray flux .",
    "emission lines from  ,  , and tentatively h - like ne are observed in the soft x - ray spectrum of the northwest and southeast regions .",
    "* extrapolation of the best power law model of the soft ( 0.5  2 kev ) , extended , circumnuclear emission to higher energies gives a 2  10 kev luminosity of @xmath210 , which is 1% of that of the unabsorbed nuclear luminosity in the same band .",
    "furthermore , the photon index ( @xmath12 ) of this soft emission agrees with that ( @xmath70 ) of the directly viewed hard x - ray emission , and so the soft emission is consistent with being electron - scattered x - rays from the nucleus .",
    "the scattering region must be ionized to ionization parameter @xmath211 in order to be sufficiently transparent to soft x - rays .",

    "<S> we report _ chandra _ acis and quasi - simultaneous _ rxte _ observations of the nearby , powerful radio galaxy cygnus a , with the present paper focusing on the properties of the active nucleus . in the _ chandra _ </S>",
    "<S> observation , the hard ( @xmath0 a few kev ) x - ray emission is spatially unresolved with a size @xmath1 ( 1.5 kpc , @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) and coincides with the radio and near infrared nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the soft ( @xmath4 ) emission exhibits a bi - polar nebulosity that aligns with the optical bi - polar continuum and emission - line structures and approximately with the radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the soft x - ray emission corresponds very well with the [ ] @xmath5 and h@xmath6 + [ ] @xmath7 , 6583 nebulosity imaged with hst . at the location of the nucleus </S>",
    "<S> there is only weak soft x - ray emission , an effect that may be intrinsic or result from a dust lane that crosses the nucleus perpendicular to the source axis . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the various x - ray components have been obtained by simultaneous fits to the 6 detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the compact nucleus is detected to 100 kev and is well described by a heavily absorbed power law spectrum with @xmath8 ( similar to other narrow line radio galaxies ) and equivalent hydrogen column @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this column is compatible with the dust obscuration to the near infrared source for a normal gas to dust ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the soft ( @xmath10 ) emission from the nucleus may be described by a power law spectrum with the same index ( i.e. @xmath11 ) , though direct fits suggests a slightly larger value for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> narrow emission lines from highly ionized neon and silicon , as well as a `` neutral '' fe k@xmath6 line , are detected in the nucleus and its vicinity ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe k@xmath6 line ( @xmath14 ev ) is in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the ew versus @xmath15 relationship in various geometries . </S>",
    "<S> an fe k edge is also seen . </S>",
    "<S> the _ rxte _ </S>",
    "<S> observations indicate a temperature of @xmath16 kev for the cluster gas ( discussed in paper iii of this series ) and cluster emission lines of fe k@xmath6 and fe k@xmath17 and / or ni k@xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the possibility that the extended soft x - ray emission is electron - scattered nuclear radiation . </S>",
    "<S> given that 1% of the unabsorbed 2  10 kev nuclear radiation would have to be scattered , the necessary gas column ( @xmath18 ) would absorb the x - rays rather than scatter them if the gas is cold . </S>",
    "<S> thus the scattering plasma must be highly ionized . </S>",
    "<S> if this ionization is achieved through photoionization by the nucleus , the ionization parameter @xmath19 erg cm s@xmath3 and the electron density @xmath20 given the observed distance of the soft x - ray emission from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the electron column density inferred from the x - ray observations is much too low to account for the extended optical scattered light , strongly suggesting that the polarized optical light is scattered by dust . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of highly ionized ne lines in the soft x - ray spectrum requires @xmath21 erg cm s@xmath3 ; these lines may originate closer to the nucleus than the extended soft continuum or in a lower density gas . a collisionally - ionized thermal model of the extended soft x - rays can not be ruled out , but is unattractive in view of the low metal abundance required ( @xmath22 ) .    the hard x - ray to far - infrared ratio for the nucleus of cygnus a is similar to that seen in seyfert 1 and unobscured radio galaxies </S>",
    "<S> . by means of the correlation between hard x - ray luminosity and nuclear optical absolute magnitude for these classes of object , we estimate @xmath23 for cygnus a , near the borderline between seyferts and qsos .    # </S>",
