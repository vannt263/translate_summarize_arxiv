    "sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a fully lagrangian and gridless method , and has been used widely in the various fields of astrophysics @xcite , especially , in an irregular  shaped and/or self - gravitating system .",
    "it is because of its lagrangian nature and also due to the incorporation of the tree - structure @xcite .",
    "the tree structure is very efficient not only in the calculation of the gravity , but also in finding neighbours .",
    "therefore , sph becomes a very effective tool in the research of star or galaxy formation .",
    "however , @xcite ( hereafter a07 ) showed that sph has a difficulty to describe the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instability ( hereafter khi ) across a density gradient .",
    "they performed khi simulations in the two different density layers with two standard sph codes ( gadget2 @xcite , gasoline @xcite ) and five grid  based codes ( art @xcite , charm @xcite , enzo  ppm @xcite , enzo ",
    "zeus @xcite , flash @xcite ) . a complete absence of khi across a density gradient has been observed in the results of the standard sph codes . however , there are nicely rolled vortices in the simulations with the grid  based codes even in a high density contrast .",
    "the standard sph codes show the vortices in the homogeneous density case only .",
    "they also performed the interaction of a blob and a hot ambient medium with a high mach number ( the blob test ) . in the results of the grid ",
    "based codes , fingers are initiated due to the rayleigh  taylor and richtmyer  meshkov instabilities at the front of the compressed blob , and then enhanced by the khi . finally , the blob is destroyed .",
    "however , the standard sph codes show only compression of the blob .",
    "they called it `` the fundamental difference '' between the standard sph and the grid  based codes .",
    "their results should be a big problem , because the khi plays an important role in the various fields where sph has been applied intensively .",
    "a07 found that there is a strange behaviour of particles around the initial contact discontinuity of the two different density layers .",
    "particle alignments are observed , and a gap forms along the initial contact discontinuity .",
    "the gap formation or `` the peeling '' of the particle layers around a density gradient has been reported already @xcite , and the modification of the initial particle configuration has been suggested as a prescription @xcite .",
    "therefore , a07 performed the same simulation with three different initial conditions , such as the lattice , poisson and glass .",
    "although the different initial conditions showed different results to each other , the khi was still absent in the standard sph simulations .",
    "another possibility as the reason of the gap formation is the artificial viscosity , because the artificial viscosity of the standard sph has a long history of criticism @xcite in various aspects .",
    "although the artificial viscosity can give a minor change to the results , the khi is still absent irrespective of the artificial viscosity .",
    "furthermore , the enzo  zeus code used in a07 employs a von neumann  richtmyer type artificial viscosity also , but showed the khi in a density gradient .",
    "therefore , the artificial viscosity can not be a reason of the gap formation .",
    "finally , a07 concluded that the absence of the khi and the gap formation are due to an inaccurate handling of hydrodynamic force across a density gradient .",
    "the absence of khi in a density gradient is a serious problem to sph users , so there should be a quick response .",
    "@xcite suggested an artificial conduction term in the energy equation of the standard sph .",
    "similar to the role of the artificial viscosity at the momentum discontinuity , the artificial conduction acts on the thermal energy discontinuity , and changes the pressure profile to a continuous one across a density gradient .",
    "he showed that the new energy equation containing the artificial conduction term can describe the khi across a density gradient .",
    "@xcite also expected the new formulation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter i02 ) based on the new lagrangian function may handle the density gradient correctly .    in this paper , we will revisit the godunov sph ( hereafter gsph ) proposed by i02 as a possible solution of the inaccurate handling of a density gradient .",
    "the same tests in a07 have been performed here again with a two  dimensional gsph code .",
    "the unphysical force across a density gradient is much reduced in the gsph results , and the khi and other instabilities are observed . especially , the khi developing in the diagonal direction has been simulated , and a satisfying result is obtained .",
    "complicated patterns due to the combinations of the instabilities develop in the blob test .    the inaccurate handling of a density gradient in the standard sph has been studied in terms of the consistency of a numerical method , and is given in section 2 . as a prescription ,",
    "the momentum equation of gsph has been revisited with the kernel convolution and also the new lagrangian function of a particle system in section 3 .",
    "the consistency of gsph has been investigated , and a simple test to verify the density discontinuity handling has been performed in the same section .",
    "the khi simulations in the two different density layers and the blob test are in section 4 .",
    "finally , the summary is given in section 5 .",
    "probably , the most important property of a numerical scheme is the convergence , because the convergence addresses how close a numerical solution is to the actual solution .",
    "however , it is not easy in general to prove the convergence of a numerical scheme directly , because the actual solution is not unveiled in most problems . therefore , the lax equivalence ( or lax ",
    "richtmyer ) theorem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is very useful to check the convergence of a numerical scheme . according to the lax equivalence theorem ,",
    "the stability and consistency are sufficient conditions of the convergence .",
    "first of all , the stability can be defined clearly , and has been studied intensively in the standard sph so far @xcite at least in the linear regime .",
    "the standard sph is conditionally stable , so with the cfl condition @xcite , the stability of the standard sph is guaranteed    secondly , the consistency of a numerical scheme means how well the numerical equations of the scheme approximate the physical equations @xcite , and is directly related to the analysis of the truncation error .",
    "the truncation error of a numerical scheme should vanish as the time step , @xmath0 and the grid size , @xmath1 ( in sph , the smoothing length , @xmath2 is comparable to @xmath1 of grid  based codes ) approach to the infinitesimal value if the scheme has the consistency .",
    "therefore , the loss of consistency will lead to low accuracy of the numerical scheme .",
    "one may concentrate on the consistency to get the convergence of the standard sph , because the stability is already proved .",
    "although the consistency problem of the standard sph is well known already ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it will be reviewed briefly in the following sections for the convenience of readers .",
    "two approximations are needed to get the momentum equation of the standard sph .",
    "one is the kernel approximation and the other is the particle approximation . the consistency of the standard sph will be examined in both of the two approximations .",
    "the kernel approximation is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the kernel and kernel  smoothed functions , respectively .    in order to check the ( order of ) consistency of the kernel approximation",
    ", we will follow the procedure of @xcite .",
    "if a numerical scheme can produce a polynomial of up to @xmath6order exactly , the numerical scheme is said to have the @xmath6order consistency .",
    "for example , to check the @xmath7order consistency of the kernel approximation , put a constant function , @xmath8 into eq .",
    "( [ kernel_approxi ] ) , then the kernel ",
    "smoothed function becomes @xmath9 here , the normalisation condition of the kernel function , @xmath10 is used .",
    "the @xmath7order of consistency is easily proved by eq .",
    "( [ kernel_approxi_0 ] ) . for the @xmath11order consistency",
    ", one may put a linear function , @xmath12 into @xmath13 , then @xmath14 here , the normalisation condition ( eq . ( [ nor_cond ] ) ) and the symmetry property of the kernel function , @xmath15 are used .    for a higher order of consistency ,",
    "we need a higher moment of a kernel function . for example",
    ", the @xmath16order of consistency needs that the @xmath16 moment of a kernel function should be @xmath17 however , it is impossible to achieve this with a non  negative kernel function . therefore , the order of consistency of the kernel approximation is less than 2 with a non  negative and normalised symmetric kernel function .    for a more complete discussion , we may have to repeat the same analysis above for the first derivative of @xmath18 also , because the hydrodynamic equations contain the first derivative of physical quantities .",
    "however , it is not necessary to check the consistency only , so omitted here .",
    "see @xcite or @xcite for the further details .",
    "the consistency depends on the normalisation condition of the kernel .",
    "therefore , the kernel approximation loses its @xmath7order consistency if the normalisation condition is not satisfied , for example , at the edge of a dense cloud in a rarefied ambient medium .",
    "however , the tests performed in a07 and also in sec . [ sec_tests ] have correct boundary treatments , so the incompleteness of a kernel function at the boundary is not a critical problem in the tests .",
    "although the kernel approximation has the consistency , it is not directly used in the equations of sph . instead of the kernel approximation ,",
    "the particle approximation is used for the derivation of the standard sph equations , and is explained below .",
    "the particle approximation used in the standard sph is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "we will repeat the same procedure performed in the previous section to check the consistency of the particle approximation . for",
    "the @xmath7order , put a constant @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ particle_approxi ] ) , then @xmath24 the particle approximation can reproduce the constant function when @xmath25 eq . ( [ sph_id ] ) holds only in an even distribution of particles .",
    "therefore , the particle approximation loses its @xmath7order consistency in an uneven distribution of particles , and eventually the standard sph is unable to converge to the actual solution in that situation .",
    "this problem appears in the equation of motion of the standard sph . with a pressure equilibrium , one of the typical motion equation of the standard sph without the artificial viscosity",
    "may be written by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is @xmath28 , and the physical variables have their usual meaning .",
    "although a pressure equilibrium is assumed , the hydrodynamic acceleration of particle @xmath29 does nt vanish , so the particle will move .",
    "figure [ sph_acc ] shows this unphysical force .",
    "the calculated acceleration ( red solid line with dots ) should vanish because the pressure is constant across the density discontinuity .",
    "however , the acceleration shows a repulsion of particles at the discontinuity .",
    "this repulsion damps the initial perturbation , and suppresses the khi .",
    "it will make a gap between the two different density layers as well .",
    "is scaled by the smoothing length , @xmath2 .",
    "the red solid line with dots is the acceleration of particles calculated by the standard sph .",
    "the red solid line without dots shows the expected acceleration under a pressure equilibrium .",
    "a repulsion happens at the density discontinuity , and will damp the initial perturbation .",
    "therefore , any instability across the density gradient may be suppressed in the standard sph.,width=321 ]    therefore , one may understand that the occurrence of the unphysical force across a density gradient in a pressure equilibrium is due to the loss of the @xmath7order consistency .",
    "the only way to eliminate the unphysical force is to make the density term inside the round brackets of eq .",
    "( [ motion_sph ] ) an even function .",
    "especially , a uniform density field around particle @xmath29 is the interesting case , and this is why the khi appears in the homogeneous density case ( 1:1 density contrast case ) in a07 .",
    "however , a uniform distribution of particles is a special situation , not a general one .",
    "the inconsistency of the standard sph is due to eq .",
    "( [ sph_id ] ) , which appears in the conversion from a continuum ( the kernel approximation ) to a particle system ( the particle approximation ) .",
    "i02 and @xcite pointed out eq .",

    "the front of the blob is compressed due to the ram pressure of the ambient medium .",
    "there is an evaporation behind the blob . a bow shock forms around the compressed blob , and then three fingers develop due to the rayleigh  taylor and richtmyer  meshkov instabilities .",
    "the fingers are enhanced by the khi , so the mushroom pattern develops at the head of the fingers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the result of the blob test performed by gsph is similar to the results of the grid  based code ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the standard sph does not accurately describe pressure gradient in the location with a large density gradient , so it shows the absence of the khi in that situation .",
    "this is due to the inaccurate force calculation across the density gradient .",
    "there is an unphysical force across the density gradient , and this unphysical force pushes the particles away from the the initial discontinuity to make a gap and to damp the initial perturbation .",
    "therefore , the development of any instability is suppressed at the density gradient .",
    "the inaccurate force calculation is due to the inconsistency of the standard sph .",
    "the particle approximation used in the derivation of the motion equation of the standard sph loses the @xmath7order consistency if particles are unevenly distributed .",
    "one may use the lagrangian function for the derivation of the momentum equation , but the lagrangian function of the standard sph uses the particle approximation already , so the resulting momentum equation shows still the unphysical force across a density gradient .    in order to solve the consistency problem of the standard sph",
    ", we have revisited the new formulation of i02 , called gsph . with the kernel convolution , new momentum equation is derived .",
    "we have proved that the momentum equation of gsph has linear consistency up to the accuracy with which the kernel convolution integral can be calculated , leading to a much reduced unphysical force across a density gradient in the pressure equilibrium .",
    "the same momentum equation can be derived using the new lagrangian function ( i02 ) .",
    "it is very similar to the lagrangian function of the standard sph , but is more accurate to the real fluid lagrangian function .",
    "we have explained the geometrical meaning of the motion equation of gsph .",
    "it considers the host and neighbour particles as an extended body , and uses the detailed information of the extended bodies . in the standard sph",
    ", the host particle is smoothed by the contributions of neighbours , but the neighbours are considered as a point .",
    "two kinds of test have been performed to show the performance of gsph .",
    "one is the traditional khi test in the two layers , and the other is the blob test . in the two layer test , gsph showed the development of the khi even with the very high density contrast .",
    "the khi developing along the diagonal direction has been performed also , and a satisfying result has been obtained . in the blob test , gsph can describe the formation and evolution of the fingers due to the instabilities and the combinations of instabilities in front of the compressed blob .",
    "the blob test result of gsph coincides with the results of the grid  based codes .    in the standard sph , not only the momentum equation , but also the energy equation is inconsistent in the uneven particle distribution .",
    "we are investigating the influence of the inconsistency on the energy equation , and it is left for a following work .",
    "the authors thank to oscar agertz for the providing the details of the tests performed in a07 , and to anthony whitworth and alexander hobbs for the useful discussion .",
