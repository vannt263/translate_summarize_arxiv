    "the investigations of elementary particle physics beyond the standard model are one of the interest line of modern researches .",
    "particular attention is given to the light goldstone and pseudogoldstone bozons , arising at spontaneously breaking of some symmetry .",
    "in view of weak interaction with matter the special interest for such particles is caused by possible astrophysical applications .",
    "in particular , the nature of cool dark matter remains the mystery of modern cosmology .",
    "the one of the most likely candidate for the dark matter is axion associated with peccei - quinn symmetry  @xcite . the extremely small value of axion mass  . ] ,    10 ^ -6",
    "< m_a < 10 ^ -2 , [ eq : ax_mass ] and gigantic life time in vacuum  @xcite _ a 2 ~10 ^ 50 ( ) ^6 ( ) , are two paramount factors why axion is of astrophysical and cosmology interest .",
    "axion with such mass ( [ eq : ax_mass ] ) could form a considerable fraction of dark matter . moreover",
    "the region with high density of axion ( so - called axion stars ) could exist in universe.the possibility existence of such axion objects has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "dense axion matter playing the role of active medium could influence on particles properties .",
    "in particular , the change of the dispersion relation of the high energy cosmic ray propagating in pseudoscalar particle medium was investigated in  @xcite . however , as it will be shown further the result presented in  @xcite is significantly overestimated .",
    "this is due to the fact that authors  @xcite used the lagrangian with the yukawa coupling as the lagrangian of axion - fermion interaction .    in this letter",
    "we review the influence of cool axion matter on the fermion dispersion .",
    "the modification of the fermion dispersion is caused by fermion `` forward - scattering '' of medium axion .",
    "the axion - fermion interaction will be analyzed by using the lagrangian in the form  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the model - dependent parameter of the order of unit , @xmath2 is the peccei - quinn symmetry - breaking scale , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fermion and axion fields respectively .",
    "it should be noted that in order to obtain the correct amplitudes of processes involving two axions , it is necessary to use just the lagrangian with derivative ( [ eq : lag-1 ] ) rather then yukawa lagrangian l_af = ( _ 5 ) a , [ eq : lag-2 ] as it was indicated for the first time in  @xcite .",
    "for investigation the fermion dispersion in axion medium the process of fermion `` forward scattering '' of plasma axions ( fig.1 ) should be taken into account .",
    "the amplitude of this process is intimately connected with fermion mass operator @xmath5 by the following relation m = -    of fermion .",
    "the amplitude corresponding to the left diagram in fig.1 has the form @xmath6\\:u(p)\\right ) , \\label{eq : amp-1 } \\medskip\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the axion and fermion four - momentum correspondingly , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the axion distribution function , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the propagator of fermion with mass @xmath13 : @xmath14    the amplitude corresponding to the right diagram in fig.1 can be obtained from ( [ eq : amp-1 ] ) by the substituting @xmath15 .",
    "performing some calculations , the total amplitude of the coherent scattering process @xmath16 of all plasma axions can be written as @xmath17    with the definition ( [ eq : mass ] ) the fermion mass operator has the form @xmath18 there is good reason to believe that axion gas is most likely a cool nonrelativistic medium .",
    "so it is possible to carry out calculations in the approximation @xmath19 . under such conditions the expression for the mass operator",
    "is essentially simplified    @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the concentration of axion gas , @xmath22 is the four - vector of medium which in its rest system has the form @xmath23 .    as one see from ( [ eq :",
    "s-2 ] ) the mass operator can be presented in the form : @xmath24 @xmath25    the fermion dispersion low can be extracted from equation det ( p - m_f - ) = 0 .",
    "[ eq : disp ] for the fermion energy in the cool axion medium from ( [ eq : disp ] ) with ( [ eq : s-3 ] ) one obtains @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fermion energy in vacuum .",
    "this is our main result determining the fermion dispersion in the cool axion medium . for the purpose of comparison ( [ eq : energy ] ) with the previous result @xcite we estimate the deviation of fermion mass squared in the cool axion medium from vacuum one , @xmath28 :    @xmath29    the deviation of fermion mass squared from ( [ eq : energy ] )",
    "can be written as m_f^2 2 m_f^2(a+b ) - 2 c .",
    "taking into account smallness of the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 the axion medium correction to squared of the fermion mass is @xmath32    it can be seen that this contribution is strongly suppressed not only by the energy scale of the breakdown symmetry @xmath2 in denominator but the axion mass @xmath33 in numerator as well .",
    "as was pointed above , the result for the squared of the fermion mass in axion medium under the same physical conditions was presented early  @xcite in the form @xmath34    the comparison of ( [ eq : m-1 ] ) with ( [ eq : m - pap ] ) @xmath35 illustrated that the result of the paper  @xcite is strongly overestimated .",
    "this is due to the fact authors @xcite uncorrectly used the lagrangian with pseudoscalar yukawa coupling for investigation the process of fermion `` forward scattering '' of axions medium .",
    "we have studied the influence of cool axion medium to the fermion dispersion . the contribution into squared of fermion mass due to presence of axion medium is calculated .",
    "the investigation of this type were performed early in paper  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrated that calculation of fermion dispersion in the axion medium with yukava lagrangian leads to the significantly overestimate results . under real astrophysical conditions",
    "the influence of axion medium to the fermion dispersion turns out to be negligible small .",
