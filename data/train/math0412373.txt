    "groups generated by automata appeared in the early 60 s , in particular through the work of aleshin  @xcite ; important examples were studied later by grigorchuk  @xcite and gupta and sidki  @xcite .",
    "a general theory of such groups has only recently started to emerge .",
    "the situation changed considerably when the last author introduced the notion of `` limit space '' of a contracting group generated by automata .",
    "this provided a bridge with dynamical systems , by associating with such a group a space with covering map , and vice versa .",
    "this paper explores the degree to which these two notions are equivalent .",
    "it turns out that the construction of a contracting group from a limit space , and of a limit space from a contracting group , are inverse to each other if the limit space is considered as a topological orbispace ( theorem  [ thm : samegp ] ) .",
    "the orbispaces considered in this paper are quite complicated : for example , they have uncountable fundamental group ; the set of points with non - trivial isotropy groups is dense , etc .",
    "other constructions would yield `` nicer '' limit orbispaces , e.g.  such that the points with non - trivial isotropy groups form a closed nowhere dense set ; but at the cost of making less transparent the similarity between self - coverings of orbispaces and self - similar groups .",
    "this paper also attempts to present in a uniform way automata , groups , limit spaces , and the tilings that they carry .",
    "many of the results are not new , although wherever possible they are stated in greater generality .    the main connections , starting from an automaton ( @xmath0 ) , or a topological space with a branched covering ( @xmath1 ) , are as follows : @xmath2^{\\text{generate } }    \\ar@/_1pc/[d]_{\\txt{\\scriptsize inverse\\\\ \\scriptsize paths } }    \\ar@{}[dr]|(0.35){\\displaystyle\\dagger }    \\ar@{}[dr]|(0.75){\\displaystyle\\ddagger } &    { \\gamma}\\ar@/^1pc/[d]^{\\text{complete}}\\ar@/^1pc/[l]^{\\text{nucleus } } \\\\    { s}\\ar@/^1pc/[u]^{\\text{leaves}}\\ar@/_1pc/[r]_{s/[x , y]\\sim[x , y ' ] } &     { l}\\ar@/_1pc/[r]_{\\text{galois}}\\ar[ur]_{\\pi_1(l)/\\text{kernel } }      \\ar@/_1pc/[l]_{\\varprojlim } &    { \\overline\\gamma}\\\\    & { x}\\ar@/_1pc/[u]_{\\txt{\\scriptsize remove rami-\\\\ \\scriptsize    fication orbit}}}\\ ] ] the connecting constructions are a limit space ( @xmath3 ) , a solenoid ( @xmath4 ) and a discrete group ( @xmath5 ) .",
