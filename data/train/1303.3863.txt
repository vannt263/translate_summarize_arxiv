    "the past decade has shown significant progress in the understanding of the neutrino .",
    "in particular , oscillation of the neutrino between electron , muon , and tau flavors has been experimentally verified .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation is determined by nature s choice of the relationship between the mass and flavor eigenstates , which we parameterize with the three mixing angles @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the difference of the squared neutrino masses , @xmath9 , determines the frequency of flavor oscillation  @xcite . as of one year ago ,",
    "all of these parameters of nature had been measured except for @xmath6 .",
    "previous measurements of the anti - neutrinos emitted from nuclear reactors had shown that @xmath10 at 90%  c.l  @xcite .",
    "more recently , tension between measurements of solar and reactor neutrino oscillation suggested that @xmath6 may be non - zero  @xcite . at the end of 2011 , experiments with accelerator neutrinos  @xcite and reactor anti - neutrinos  @xcite showed hints of non - zero @xmath6 at the level of 1 to 2.5 standard deviations .    a relative measurement of reactor anti - neutrinos by detectors at two distances was proposed to improve the sensitivity to oscillation due to @xmath6  @xcite . using this method of multiple detectors , in mar .",
    "2012 the daya bay experiment observed a non - zero value of @xmath6 at 5.2 standard deviations  @xcite .",
    "soon thereafter , the reno experiment reported a consistent result using two detectors  @xcite .",
    "the daya bay experiment has now reported an improved measurement of @xmath6 using 127 days of data , 2.5@xmath0 the statistics of the initial result  @xcite .",
    "the daya bay experiment was designed to provide the most precise measurement of @xmath6 of the existing and near future experiments , with sensitivity to @xmath11 at the 90%  c.l .",
    "this precision was achieved through site choice , experiment layout , and detector design . at 17.4 gw@xmath12 the daya",
    "bay reactor complex is one of the largest in the world , isotropically emitting roughly @xmath13 anti - neutrinos per second .",
    "six anti - neutrino detectors , each with a 20-ton gadolinium - doped liquid scintillating target region , was the largest ( 4@xmath0 ) of the current generation of @xmath6 reactor experiments .",
    "anti - neutrinos were detected via inverse beta - decay ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the combined detection of scintillation light from the prompt positron and the gamma rays from the delayed capture of the neutron on gadolinium had high efficiency ( @xmath1580% ) and low background contamination ( @xmath165% ) .",
    "the experiment layout consisted of three detector halls . the first hall ( eh1 )",
    "had two anti - neutrino detectors at a distance of 364 m from the two daya bay reactor cores , eh2 had one anti - neutrino detector roughly 500 m from the four ling ao reactor cores , while eh3 had three anti - neutrino detectors 1912 m from the daya bay cores and 1540 m from the ling ao cores .",
    "the detectors in the near halls provided a measurement of the mostly unoscillated total reactor flux , while the far hall was situated near the predicted oscillation maximum .",
    "the experimental halls were located underground beneath adjacent mountains .",
    "the resulting cosmic ray shielding limited cosmogenic backgrounds to @xmath150.2% of the measured anti - neutrino signal .",
    "additionally , detectors were placed within active water cherenkov veto detectors .",
    "the water veto detectors reduced cosmogenic neutrons to a negligible background .",
    "figure  [ fig : farhall ] shows the three anti - neutrino detectors during installation in the far experimental hall .    these experiment design choices resulted in a nearly background - free measurement of 200 ( 2000 ) anti - neutrino interactions per day for the far ( near ) detectors .",
    "the use of multiple detectors of identical design allowed for 0.2% uncertainty in the relative detector efficiency .",
    "the hall locations were optimized to limit the impact of uncertainties in relative neutrino flux for each reactor core .",
    "a complete description of the daya bay detectors , experiment layout , and initial results are given in  @xcite .",
    "using 127 days of data taken between dec .  24 ,  2011 and may  11 ,  2012 , a total of 234,217 inverse beta - decay anti - neutrino candidates were measured by the six detectors ( eh1 : 69121 , 69714 ; eh2 : 66473 ; eh3 : 9788 , 9669 , 9452 ) .",
    "the analysis approach closely follows that reported in  @xcite , except for the increase in livetime .",
    "the muon rates vary for each hall due to the different mountain overburdens .",
    "the resulting variation in muon veto times leads to the largest difference in relative efficiencies between detectors in separate halls ( eh1 : 0.8015 , 0.7986 ; eh2 : 0.8364 ; eh3 : 0.9555 , 0.9552 , 0.9547 ) , although the uncertainty in this veto time is negligible ( @xmath160.01% ) .",
    "the uncertainty in relative detector efficiencies is dominated by the uncertainty introduced by the 6 - 12 mev energy selection of the delayed neutron capture ( 0.12% ) , described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the largest background in the anti - neutrino candidates are two uncorrelated background radiation interactions that accidentally satisfy the energy and time correlation for inverse beta - decay anti - neutrino selection .",
    "such events , called _ accidentals _ , account for 4.0@xmath170.05% ( 1.5@xmath170.02% ) of the far ( near ) candidates .",
    "the high statistics of uncorrelated signals allow for the high - precision estimation of this background .",
    "the uncertainty in background is dominated by two sources of correlated signals .",
    "the cosmogenic @xmath18-n isotope @xmath19li contributes 0.3@xmath170.2% ( 0.4@xmath170.2% ) of the far ( near ) candidates . in addition , the three 0.5  hz @xmath20am-@xmath21c neutron calibration sources present above the lid of each detector introduced a background .",
    "the prompt gamma signal from neutron inelastic scattering on iron , followed by the delayed gamma rays produced by capture on stainless steel are estimated to be 0.3@xmath170.3% of the far detector candidates .",
    "other correlated backgrounds due to energetic cosmogenic neutrons ( i.e.   _ fast neutrons _ ) and ( @xmath22,n ) nuclear interactions are negligible in comparison .    after correcting the candidate counts for total livetime , veto efficiency , and background contributions ,",
    "the resulting anti - neutrino rates in each detector were eh1 : 662.47@xmath173.00 , 670.87@xmath173.01 ; eh2 : 613.53@xmath172.69 ; eh3 : 77.57@xmath170.85 , 76.62@xmath170.85 , 74.97@xmath170.84 per day .",
    "the rates for detectors in the same halls are consistent within statistical uncertainty taking into account the small differences in distance from reactors .",
    "the near detector anti - neutrino rates were used to predict the expected rates at the far detectors assuming no oscillation .",
    "the far detectors found 0.944@xmath170.007(stat)@xmath170.003(syst ) of the expected flux relative to the near sites .",
    "an analysis of the relative anti - neutrino rates of the six detectors in a standard three - flavor oscillation model found @xmath23 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ratecompare ] ] .",
    "the addition of 77 days to the previous 50 days of daya bay detector exposure has confirmed the previous observation of reactor anti - neutrino disappearance , and improved the precision of the estimate of the neutrino mixing angle @xmath6 .",
    "the combination of experiment location , layout , and detector design has yielded the highest signal rate , lowest background rate , and consequently most precise @xmath6 measurement of the existing oscillation experiments .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is still twice as large as the systematic uncertainty , so the collection of additional data will continue to improve the precision .",
    "the daya bay experiment also has the potential to estimate the squared - mass difference @xmath24 via distortion of the positron energy spectrum . and @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting _ effective _ squared - mass difference is commonly referred to as @xmath26 . ] the existing data also provides for a high - statistics measurement of the absolute reactor anti - neutrino flux .",
    "measurement of a non - zero value for @xmath6 allows for future experiments to probe the possibility of charge - parity ( cp ) violation in neutrinos .",
