    "cosmic black holes ( bh ) show a very wide range of masses : from stellar masses to hundreds of millions of solar masses . an open question has long been whether the accretion and variability processes occurring in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon are the same over this broad mass range . to test this intriguing possibility , investigators identified and studied a characteristic timescale associated with the aperiodic x - ray variability of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this timescale corresponds to a break in the power spectral density ( psd ) at a certain temporal frequency where a power - law of slope @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) breaks to a steeper slope @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite proposed a scaling relationship between the break frequency , the mass of the black hole and the bolometric luminosity of its accretion flow .",
    "this extended earlier work which hypothesized that the break timescales of agn scale linearly with bh mass from the timescales observed in bhxrbs , albeit with some scatter .",
    "@xcite found that this scatter can be explained by introducing the bolometric luminosity as a correction factor .",
    "this lead them to conclude that agn are scaled - up galactic bhs .",
    "however , their sample consists of only 10 agn and it is therefore desirable to test their scaling relation with newly determined agn break frequencies .",
    "the bh in our own galactic center ( identified with the radio source sgr  a * ) is an an especially interesting object , as it is the most underluminous bh accretion system observed thus far ( with a bolometric luminosity nine orders of magnitude lower than its eddington luminosity ) .",
    "it can therefore test the @xcite relation in so far inaccessible regions of the parameter space .",
    "the existence of a supermassive bh in the center of the milky way has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt by the proper motion of stars detected in the near - infrared ( nir ) waveband @xcite .",
    "x - ray and nir emission associated with sgr  a * has been observable since 2001 and 2003 , respectively @xcite , which showed that it is highly variable at both wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simultaneous nir and x - ray monitoring campaigns revealed that each x - ray flare is accompanied by a nir flare with zero time lag , which leads to the conclusion that the x - ray photons are being produced by compton scattering off of the relativistic electrons which radiate in the nir @xcite .",
    "the fact that the same bunch of electrons is the source for both the nir and x - ray flux makes it possible to interpret the nir timing studies reported here in the context of the agn and bhxrb x - ray results .",
    "in fact , since the x - ray background is very high due to the lack of resolving power of x - ray telescopes ( and thus only during the brightest flares is sgr  a * actually observed ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , a detailed study of the psd is more complicated in the x - rays than in the nir to the observed flux when sgr  a * is at its lowest flux levels @xcite .",
    "this low background level is negligible for the purpose of our study . ] .",
    "recent studies of the nir properties of sgr  a * showed that the variability on timescales of minutes to hours is completely described by an ( unbroken ) power - law psd with a slope of -1.6 to -2.5 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * see also fig .",
    "18 in eckart et al . 2006a . ) .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we extend the time baseline up to years by combining keck and vlt data",
    ". we report for the first time the existence of a power - law break frequency in the nir psd of sgr  a * , and we show that its deduced range is inconsistent with the @xcite scaling relation , but fits the expected value when linear scaling with mass is assumed .",
    "the nir adaptive optics instruments at keck ii ( nirc2 ) and at the vlt ut4 ( naco ) have been used for sgr  a * observations since 2003 . a time baseline of years and a sampling timescale of minutes are needed to analyze the broadband psd of sgr  a * from minutes to years .",
    "obviously , large gaps in the sampling pattern are unavoidable as the nir observations have to be carried out during the night and available telescope time limits realistic data sets to a couple of nights each year .",
    "to cover the high - frequency to mid - frequency part of the psd ( meaning timescales of minutes to days in this context ) , we looked for keck and vlt data from consecutive nights with individual night observations that are as long as possible .",
    "we identified the nights from 2004 july 06  08 ( all times ut ) as the most suitable .",
    "beginning on july 06 , sgr  a * was observed from 07:50 to 10:35 ut with keck ii , from 23:19 to 04:16 ( july 07 ) with the vlt , then again from 06:35 to 10:30 with keck ii , and finally from 00:53 ( july 08 ) to 06:53 with the vlt ( the keck and vlt data have been published in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "clearly , this dense coverage is only possible by combining the keck and vlt data sets .",
    "please note that these alternating observations were coincidental and not arranged .",
    "as the keck data for these two nights were taken at l ( centered at @xmath5 ) and all other data were taken at k - band ( centered on @xmath6 ) ) and vlt a k@xmath7 filter ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we calibrated both data sets in the same way and thus the difference is negligible .",
    "] , we adopt the finding of @xcite that the nir flux is consistent with a constant spectral index of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , we scaled the flux at l down to the k - band level with this relation .",
    "the resulting lightcurve for the 3 nights is shown in fig .",
    "all fluxes are de - reddened using @xmath11 as it was done in @xcite .",
    "other authors have claimed variable and/or somewhat steeper spectral indices ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , our results presented here are not very sensitive to the exact value of @xmath12 .    for the coverage of the mid - frequency to low - frequency part of the temporal spectrum ( timescales of days to years ) we averaged the data of individual nights .",
    "this leads to a lightcurve with irregular sampling of down to one day that covers a time baseline of 4 years .",
    "the details of the whole data set are given in table  1 .",
    "the data reduction was standard , i.e. flat fielding , sky subtraction , and correction for bad / hot pixels .",
    "the vlt data have been deconvolved with point - spread functions ( psf ) extracted from the individual images @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry was done on each image and the flux was calibrated relative to sources in the field with known flux .",
    "see @xcite for more details . for the keck data",
    "the individual psfs have been used to fit sources in the field ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the two photometric techniques lead to indistinguishable results as shown in @xcite .",
    "the irregular sampling with the large gaps makes standard fourier transform techniques unsuitable for our data set .",
    "we therefore employ the first order structure function ( sf ) , defined as @xmath13 ^ 2 >",
    "$ ] with @xmath14 being a measurement at time @xmath15 , to look for a break in the power - law psd ( a power - law in the psd translates into a power - law in the sf albeit with a different slope , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sf for our complete data set is shown in fig .  [ sf ] .",
    "the diamonds represent the high- to mid - frequency data shown in fig .",
    "[ lc ] , and the crosses show the mid- to low - frequency part . the overlapping region was used to normalize the low - frequency part such that a continuous sf emerges .",
    "it shows the superposition of a constant at short lags ( @xmath16min ) which is the result of uncorrelated measurement noise , a power - law portion between lags of minutes to hours , and a plateau / shallower power - law for long time lags ( @xmath17min ) .",
    "this plateau at low frequencies points to a break in the power - law at shorter lags . to quantify the evidence for the existence of a break frequency and its value ,",
    "monte carlo simulations are required , as the sampling pattern severely distorts any intrinsic power - law psd , and introduces the effects of red - noise leak and aliasing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we used the following approach for our mc simulations , which is very similar to the psresp method by @xcite and @xcite : 1 . an intrinsic ( broken or unbroken ) power - law psd model",
    "is assumed and corresponding lightcurves are generated using the algorithm by @xcite .",
    "this is done independently for the high - frequency and low - frequency part .",
    "these lightcurves , which are significantly longer and more densely sampled to account for aliasing and leakage , are subsequently resampled according to the sampling function of the real data and uncorrelated measurement noise is added ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "the sf from the simulated lightcurves are calculated in the same way as is done for the data ( the renormalization is done for each pair of long and short - term simulations individually ) .",
    "an observed @xmath18 value is determined by using the observed sf , the mean simulated sf , and error bars equal to the rms spread of the individual simulated sfs at each time lag @xcite .",
    "the goodness of fit is computed by modeling the @xmath18 distribution for each assumed psd model , i.e. several thousand @xmath18 values are calculated using the individual realizations of the simulations instead of the observed data . the probability that the model psd can be rejected",
    "is then given by the percentile of the simulated @xmath18 values exceeded by the value of observed @xmath18 .",
    "the steps above are repeated to scan a range of break frequencies and power - law slopes .    for each model psd",
    "we used 100 simulations for each the high- and low - frequency part . by combining both sets we arrived at 10,000 simulations to determine the @xmath18-distribution",
    ". the class of models we employed as the intrinsic psd is the singly broken power - law : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the break frequency ( the characteristic timescale ) , @xmath21 the psd amplitude at @xmath20 , @xmath22 the high - frequency power - law slope , and @xmath2 is the low - frequency power - law slope with the constraint @xmath23 .",
    "we tested a @xmath22 range of @xmath24 in increments of 0.1 , a @xmath2 range of @xmath25 in increments of 0.1 , and a break frequency range of @xmath26 in multiplicative steps of 1.2 .",
    "we also tested unbroken power - law models ( @xmath27 ) which are , however , rejected with a likelihood of acceptance of @xmath28 ( i.e. none of the 10,000 simulations equalled or exceeded the observed @xmath18 ) .",
    "the best fit result with a likelihood of acceptance of @xmath29 can be found at @xmath30 ( @xmath31min ) , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( errors here are 90% confidence limits ) .",
    "this solution is plotted over the observed sf in fig .  [ sf ] . in fig .",
    "[ contours ] we show the confidence contours in the @xmath34 plane at the best fit value for @xmath35 .",
    "when the three dimensional distribution is marginalized over two parameters , we arrive at the following likeliest values and their 90% confidence limits for the individual parameters : @xmath36 ( @xmath37min ) , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the existence of a break in the power - law psd of sgr  a * can also be inferred by a simple argument : table 1 reveals that the mean flux of sgr  a * during one night stays roughly the same over the 4 years of observations .",
    "if the power - law psd extended unbroken over decades , one would expect to observe very different mean fluxes over a time baseline of years .",
    "our detailed mc simulations serve the purpose of quantifying the location of the power - law break .",
    "the same simple argument also holds true for the mean x - ray flux of sgr  a*.    our result of a break frequency at @xmath40 is strikingly different from the prediction of the scaling relation proposed by @xcite . using a mass of @xmath41 @xcite and a bolometric luminosity of @xmath42 erg / s @xcite ,",
    "the relation by @xcite predicts a break frequency at the order of @xmath43 for sgr  a*.    interestingly , if the term with the bolometric luminosity is neglected in the @xcite relation , i.e. the bolometric index ( called b in their paper ) is set to zero , their relation predicts a break timescale of @xmath44min for sgr  a*. also , our deduced break timescale fits the expected value if linear scaling with bh mass is assumed from the typical break timescales observed in the high / soft and low / hard states of cyg x-1 ; see fig .",
    "this suggests that , while the inclusion of the bolometric luminosity as a free parameter improves the fit in a limited luminosity range , it is in fact not the true physical correction factor that can explain the scatter around the linear mass scaling .",
    "it is , however , uncertain how meaningful a comparison of sgr  a * s break timescale with the breaks of the much higher luminosity agn used to derive the mass - luminosity - timescale relation of @xcite is .",
    "these seyferts are almost certainly in a different accretion state .",
    "they have a prominent optically thick accretion disk and much higher accretion rates .",
    "the @xcite relation seems to work well when extrapolated to soft state bhxrbs , which are at comparable eddington accretion rates to the seyferts , but for the low - accretion rate hard states the comparison is less obvious .",
    "in fact , work by @xcite suggests that in the hard state the high - frequency shape of the psd is constant despite large changes in luminosity .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the break in the nir psd of sgr  a * implies that the @xcite relation with luminosity scaling applies to soft state agn , but that in the hard state there is only mass scaling .",
    "then sgr  a * seems to fit in well with the hard state bhxrbs , consistent with its low luminosity .",
    "future work will further elucidate the relationship between variability processes across the range of bh masses .",
    "our work presented here extends the set of supermassive bhs with determined break frequencies .",
    "the bh in our galactic center is especially important , as it is the most underluminous source ( in terms of eddington luminosity ) accessible to observations , and its mass determination is the most precise for supermassive bhs @xcite .",
