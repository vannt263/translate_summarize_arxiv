    "studies of the galactic stellar chemical distribution are imperative for the galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the metal - poor end of the metallicity distribution function reveals information about the early era of star formation in the galaxy , while the metal - rich end of the metallicity distribution function reflects recent galaxy conditions @xcite .",
    "there is a wide range of galaxy formation models corresponding to different predications about the stellar metallicity distribution .",
    "@xcite provided a steady galaxy formation scenario , els model . at the beginning of the galaxy formation , a relatively rapid radical collapse of the initial protogalactic cloud happened , followed by the equally rapid setting of gas into rotating disk .",
    "a steady process of the galaxy formation leads to smooth distribution of stars .",
    "however , recent discoveries of complex substructure conflict with the simple collapse model .",
    "many irregular substructures such as sagittarius dwarf tidal stream @xcite , virgo stellar stream @xcite and the monoceros stream closer to the galactic plane @xcite were found in the recent large area sky surveys .",
    "recent observations show that the galactic structure is a complex and dynamic structure .",
    "the sz model that the galaxy formed at least partly through the merge of larger systems was advanced by @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by recent studies of stellar kinematics and metallicity distribution @xcite .",
    "the metallicity distribution of different galactic components can be used to constrain the galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "the thin disk , the thick disk and the halo are the basic components of the galaxy .",
    "stars on more radial orbits are metal - poor than stars on planar orbits .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the observation data @xcite .",
    "the els model can not explain the galaxy halo without metallicity gradient while the sz model is able to account for the lack of metallicity gradient of the halo .",
    "different thick disk formation scenarios correspond to different abundance distribution in the thick disk .",
    "if the thick disk was formed in the galaxy collapse , there must be a stellar metallicity gradient in the thick disk .",
    "@xcite found that a vertical gradient of @xmath9 dex @xmath10 for the thick disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of the stellar metallicity gradient in the thick disk favor the thick disk was formed through merger of larger system or via kinematic heating of the thin disk .",
    "there has been much debate about the thick disk , some researchers pointed out that the two components of disk can not be separable from one another @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the metallicity and velocity distribution of the disk can be described by a single disk component instead of two separate ones .",
    "the most precise methods to derive the stellar metallicity are based on the spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "however , imaging survey data provide better sky and depth coverage than spectroscopic survey data .",
    "the photometric metallicity methods are based on the theory that the density of metallicity absorption lines is highest in the blue spectral region .",
    "low metal abundance produces weak atmospheric absorption lines and increased ultraviolet emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived approximate stellar abundance through measurement of ultraviolet excess , despite this method is less precise in larger distance .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for the ms stars , the stellar metallicity estimate can be derived through sdss color indices .",
