    "the light curves of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) typically have many random peaks and in spite of extensive statistical studies ( e.g. , nemiroff et al .",
    "1994 ; norris et al . 1996 ; stern 1996 ) , the temporal behavior of grbs remains a puzzle .",
    "contrary to the complicated diverse behavior in the time domain , long grbs show a simple behavior in the fourier domain ( beloborodov , stern , & svensson 1998 ) .",
    "their pds is a power law of index @xmath6 ( with a break at @xmath2  hz ) plus standard ( exponentially distributed ) statistical fluctuations superimposed onto the power law .",
    "the pds slope and the break characterize the process randomly generating the diverse light curves of grbs .",
    "intriguingly , the pds slope coincides with the slope of the kolmogorov law .",
    "the power - law behavior is seen in individual bursts ( we illustrate this in  3 ) and may provide a clue to the nature of grbs .    in the present paper",
    ", we study in detail the pdss of gamma - ray bursts . in our analysis",
    "we use 527 grb light curves with 64 ms resolution obtained by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) in the four lad energy channels , i  iv : ( i ) @xmath7 kev , ( ii ) @xmath8 kev , ( iii ) @xmath9 kev , and ( iv ) @xmath3 kev .",
    "the background is subtracted in each channel using linear fits to the 1024 ms data .",
    "the method of data analysis is described in  2 . in  3 , we study a sample of the 4 brightest and longest bursts . in ",
    "4 the average pds for the full sample of 527 grbs is calculated and discussed . in  5 , we calculate the pdss in the separate energy channels and quantify the difference of the temporal structure between the channels in terms of the pds slope .",
    "we also calculate the autocorrelation function ( acf ) in the separate channels and compare the results with previous studies of the acf . in  6 , we address dim grbs and compare them to the bright ones .",
    "the results are discussed in  7 .",
    "long bursts are of particular interest since their internal temporal structure can be studied by spectral analysis over a larger range of time scales .",
    "we choose bursts with durations @xmath10  s where @xmath11 is the time it takes to accumulate from 5% to 95% of the total fluence of a burst summed over all the four channels , i+ii+iii+iv .",
    "hereafter , we measure the brightness of a burst by its peak count rate , @xmath12 , in channels ii+iii . we analyze bursts with @xmath13 counts per time - bin , @xmath14 s. this condition coupled with the duration condition , @xmath10  s , gives a sample of 559 grbs .",
    "the sample still contains grbs with low fluence , which are not good for fourier analysis .",
    "we exclude bursts with fluences @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting sample contains 527 bursts .",
    "we calculate the fourier transform , @xmath16 , of each light curve , @xmath17 , using the standard fast fourier transform method .",
    "the power density spectrum , @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 since @xmath17 is real .",
    "the fourier transform is calculated on a standard grid with a time bin @xmath20 ms and a total number of bins @xmath21 , which corresponds to a total time @xmath22 s since the trigger time .",
    "the light curve of each burst is considered in its individual time window @xmath23 ( see  2.4 ) . in the calculations of the pds",
    ", we extend the time interval to @xmath24 by adding zeros at @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the adding zeros introduces random small - scale fluctuations in the pds ( see , e.g. , bracewell 1967 ) .",
    "we , however , study the pdss averaged over adjacent frequencies and/or over a sample of grbs .",
    "then the fluctuations in @xmath18 associated with a specific choice of the grid disappear and do not affect the results .",
    "poisson noise in the measured count rate affects the light curve on short time scales , and , correspondingly , affects the pds at high frequencies .",
    "the poisson noise has a flat spectrum , @xmath27 , introducing the `` poisson level '' , @xmath28 , in a pds .",
    "this level equals the burst total fluence including the background in the considered time window .",
    "the power spectrum above this level displays the intrinsic variability of the signal ( but see  4.2 for the time - window effects ) .",
    "we calculate the individual poisson level for each burst and subtract it from the burst pds .      one would like to see the whole burst in the window .",
    "however , ( 1 ) it is difficult to determine exactly the end of a burst because the burst can always have a weak `` tail '' hidden in the background ; ( 2 ) the window should not be very large because inclusion of long weak tails leads to an increase of the background fluence , @xmath29 , without a substantial increase in the signal fluence , @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting low ratio @xmath31 implies a high poisson level , which makes the quality of the pds worse .    to reduce the poisson level , we cut off the light curves at a time @xmath32 defined so that the signal count rate @xmath17 does not exceed @xmath33 at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . keeping in mind bursts with a weak beginning ,",
    "we define the starting window time , @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 at @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in our analysis , @xmath40 is chosen .",
    "we checked that varying @xmath41 does not significantly affect the results unless @xmath42 .",
    "note that , for dim bursts , poisson fluctuations of the background ( which are imprinted on @xmath17 even after subtraction of the average background level ) may exceed @xmath43",
    ". then the window @xmath23 is determined by the background fluctuations rather than by the signal .",
    "the brightest and longest bursts are the best ones for fourier analysis . in this section ,",
    "we study the four brightest bursts with @xmath0 s. they have trigger numbers # 2156 ( grb 930201 ) , 2856 ( grb 940302 ) , 3227 ( grb 941008 ) , and 6472 ( grb 941110 ) .",
    "we take the light curves , @xmath17 , summed over channels ii and iii , in which the signal is strongest . to simplify the comparison of different bursts , we take peak - normalized light curves .",
    "their fourier transform , @xmath16 , is therefore normalized by @xmath12 , and the pds , @xmath44 , is normalized by @xmath45 .",
    "the four peak - normalized light curves and their pdss are shown in figure  1 ( we smooth the pdss on the scale @xmath46 before plotting ) .",
    "the light curves are very different while the pdss are similar .",
    "they can be described as a single power law , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) with super - imposed fluctuations @xmath50 . in spite of the large @xmath51",
    ", the power - law behavior can be seen in each burst due to the power - law extending over more than two decades in frequency .",
    "the presence of an underlying power law is an interesting feature of the grb temporal behavior .",
    "a possible way to extract it from the noisy individual pdss is to take the average pds over a sample of long grbs .",
    "then the fluctuations affecting each individual pds tend to cancel each other and one can see the power - law behavior .",
    "the average of the four pdss is plotted in figure  2 .",
    "one can see that the amplitude of irregularities is reduced after the averaging and one can measure the slope of the resulting pds .",
    "the power - law fit in the range @xmath52 gives @xmath53 .",
    "( we use the standard @xmath54 fitting procedure with equal weights for each frequency bin . )",
    "= 8.5cm=8.cm",
    "the pds analysis was previously performed for a number of individual bursts .",
    "belli ( 1992 ) , for example , analyzed grbs detected by the konus experiment onboard the soviet probes venera 11 and venera 12 , and giblin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) studied individual batse bursts .",
    "the power - law pds can be observed in their longest complex bursts as well .",
    "when turning to grbs with relatively modest durations , @xmath55  s , it becomes more difficult to see the power - law behavior in individual bursts .",
    "the statistical fluctuations , @xmath50 , significantly affect the apparent pds slope derived for the available range of frequencies , which is limited by @xmath56 .",
    "however , having a large number of bursts allows one to study the pds by averaging over the sample .",
    "in most of the grb models ( e.g. , in the internal shock model ) , different bursts are produced by one physical mechanism of stochastic nature , i.e. , an individual burst is a random realization of the same standard process .",
    "stern & svensson ( 1996 ) suggested an empirical pulse - avalanche model of this type .",
    "they showed that near - critical avalanches reproduce the statistical characteristics of grbs as well as their extreme diversity .",
    "with such an approach , individual grbs are like pieces of a `` puzzle '' , and the features of the standard engine can be probed with statistical methods applied to a sufficiently large ensemble of grbs .",
    "the simplest statistical characteristic of the pds is the average pds , @xmath57 .",
    "the averaging means that we sum up the pdss of individual bursts with some weights ( normalization ) and divide the result by the number of bursts in the sample .",
    "if no normalization is employed , then the brightest bursts strongly dominate @xmath57 , and their individual fluctuations lead to strong fluctuations in @xmath57 .",
    "the pdss of relatively weak bursts are suppressed proportionally to @xmath58 and they are lost in the averaging .",
    "a normalization procedure is thus needed to increase the weight of relatively weak bursts in the sample .",
    "we prefer the peak - normalization because :    \\(i ) the amplitude of the resulting pds is practically independent of the burst brightness ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the fluctuations in @xmath57 turn out to be minimal and the best accuracy of the slope is achieved .",
    "the distribution of the individual @xmath18 around @xmath57 follows a standard exponential law ( see beloborodov et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the amplitude of fluctuations in @xmath57 is given by a simple formula , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the number of bursts in the sample .",
    "the averaging procedure is the following .",
    "( 1 ) for each burst we first determine its individual poisson level .",
    "( 2 ) we determine the peak , @xmath12 , of the light curve , @xmath17 , with the background subtracted .",
    "( 3 ) we normalize the light curve to its peak . ( 4 ) we calculate the pds of the normalized light curve . ( 5 ) we normalize the poisson level by @xmath45 and subtract it from the pds . ( 6 ) we sum up the resulting pdss over the sample and divide by the number of bursts .",
    "the resulting average pds , @xmath57 , for the 527 peak - normalized light curves in channels ( ii+iii ) is shown in figure  3 .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot the average pds with the @xmath61-normalization , where @xmath30 is the burst fluence excluding the background .",
    "each light curve is then normalized by @xmath62 , and its pds ( and its poisson level ) is normalized by @xmath30 .",
    "this normalization gives different weights ( the weights of dim bursts are reduced as compared to the peak - normalization ) .",
    "the resulting average pds has a different amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath57 again follows a power law with approximately the same slope .",
    "this provides evidence that the self - similar behavior with @xmath6 is an intrinsic property of grbs , rather than an artifact of the averaging procedure .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the fact that we observe the power law in the longest individual bursts .",
    "when comparing individual pdss , @xmath18 , with the peak - normalized @xmath57 , one sees that @xmath18 is exponentially distributed around @xmath57 , and the distribution is self - similar with respect to shifts in @xmath63 .",
    "the power - law fit to @xmath57 in the range @xmath64 gives @xmath65 for the peak - normalized bursts , and @xmath66 for @xmath61-normalized bursts .",
    "the formal error found from the @xmath54 fitting is very small , @xmath67 ( we take the variance , @xmath68 ) .",
    "note that the slope in the peak - normalized case is different from @xmath69 reported in beloborodov et al .",
    "this change is caused by the fact that we have extended the sample to smaller brightnesses ( see  6 ) .",
    "the deviation from the power law at the low - frequency end is due to the finite duration of bursts . at the high frequency end",
    ", there is a break at @xmath2  hz .",
    "the break is observed in the brightest grbs even without subtracting the poisson level ( see beloborodov et al .",
    "1998 and the top panel in fig .  8) .",
    "note that the break position is the same for the peak - normalized and @xmath61-normalized bursts ( see fig .",
    "it stays the same in the separate energy channels ( see fig",
    ".  5 ) and does not depend on the poisson level .",
    "one may also see the break in individual long bursts ( figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the break is far too sharp to be explained as an artifact of the 64 ms time binning , which suppresses the pds by a factor of @xmath70 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath20 ms is the time bin ( cf .",
    "van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    = 8.0 cm      fourier analysis was designed for physical problems dealing with linear differential equations .",
    "for example , it is usually applied to small perturbations above a given background solution .",
    "the fourier power spectrum is also commonly used in the temporal studies of long signals or noises , e.g. , in persistent astrophysical sources . by contrast",
    ", grbs have strongly non - linear signals with short durations .",
    "the typical number of batse time - bins ( @xmath20 ms ) in a long grb is a few @xmath71 .",
    "do the effects of finite duration ( i.e. , time - window effects ) strongly affect the measured pds ?    the issue is illustrated in figure  4 .",
    "we prepared an artificial long signal with @xmath72 and exponentially distributed @xmath18 , i.e. , the probability to detect @xmath18 at a given @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath73 ) .",
    "the phase structure was taken to be gaussian ( i.e. , random ) .",
    "the signal duration is @xmath74  s. then , we cut the long signal into 64 pieces of equal length @xmath75 s. we thus get 64 short signals , each is a random realization / fragment of the same stationary process characterized by the index @xmath76 .",
    "analogously to our analysis of real grbs , we normalize each signal to its peak and add zeros up to @xmath77 ( our standard grid ) .",
    "then we calculate the average pds , @xmath57 , for the 64 artificial signals .",
    "the result is shown in figure  4 for the three cases : @xmath78 ( poisson ) , @xmath79 ( flicker ) , and @xmath80 ( kolmogorov ) .",
    "one can see that the time - window effects are strong in the case @xmath78 .",
    "the poisson signal is roughly constant on large time scales . as a result , at modest @xmath63",
    ", @xmath57 is just the power spectrum of the @xmath81-window .",
    "by contrast , in the case @xmath80 , we have large - amplitude variations in the signal on all time scales .",
    "the average pds of the 64 short signals then reproduces well the intrinsic pds slope throughout the whole range of frequencies , down to @xmath82 ( see bottom panel in fig .  4 ) .",
    "hence , the power law we observe in the average pds of grbs can be interpreted as that grbs are random short realizations of a standard process which is characterized by the pds slope @xmath6 .",
    "note , however , that the power spectrum does not provide a complete description of the signal since the phase structure is not considered .",
    "what does the average pds look like in the separate energy channels ?",
    "the signal to noise ratio is low in channel i and especially in channel iv .",
    "the number of grbs for which good pdss can be obtained in channels i  iv is therefore limited to the brightest bursts .",
    "we choose a sample of bursts with @xmath83 counts / bin ( in channels ii+iii ) , which contains 152 bursts .",
    "the burst analysis is now performed in each channel separately .",
    "we determine the poisson level of a burst in each channel , @xmath84 , and find the peak of the light curve , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 i , ii , iii , iv . then we perform the peak - normalization : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we set the time window in each channel @xmath89 as described in  2.4 .",
    "= 16.5cm=16.5 cm    the resulting average pdss in channels i  iv are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the differences in the slopes are clearly seen .",
    "we fitted the pdss by power laws , @xmath90 , in the range @xmath91 .",
    "channel iv is fitted in the range @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath76 of the fits are listed in table  1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in the pds calculations we subtracted the poisson level , which is quite high for dim bursts ( see fig .",
    "one therefore should address a technical question : how well is the intrinsic pds restored after subtracting the poisson level ?    to investigate this issue we have performed the following test .",
    "we take the sample of 91 bright bursts ( group a ) and add a strong poisson noise ( with an average level of 25000 counts / bin ) to each burst in the group .",
    "we thus artificially increase the poisson level by two orders of magnitude .",
    "alternatively , one may consider this procedure as a rescaling of bright bursts to a smaller brightness while keeping the poisson background at the same level .",
    "then , we analyze the artificial bursts in the same way as we did with the real dim grbs .",
    "note that even after subtraction of the time - averaged background , its poisson noise strongly affects the signal and may create artificial peaks dominating the true peak of the signal .",
    "for the artificial bursts , we know the true peak ( which is the peak of the original bright burst ) . in real dim bursts we do not know the position of the true peak and employ the peak search scheme described in stern , poutanen , & svensson ( 1999 ) .",
    "= 14.5cm=14.5 cm    the result is compared with the average pds of the original sample in figure  9 .",
    "we find that the subtraction of the poisson level allows one to restore the original pds , @xmath18 , also at frequencies where @xmath18 is well below the poisson level .",
    "even the 1 hz break remains present .",
    "we conclude that the high poisson level is unlikely to significantly affect the measured pds slope .",
    "the average time profile ( atp ) of grbs was found to follow a stretched exponential of index @xmath94 ( stern 1996 ) .",
    "is there any relation between the atp and the average pds ?",
    "one should note two important differences between the atp and the pds studies : ( 1 ) the @xmath5 pds , though affected by the statistical fluctuations , is observed in _",
    "individual _ bursts , while the atp is a purely statistical property of a large sample of bursts ; ( 2 ) the atp is constructed for grbs of _ all durations _ ( and only in this case it displays the perfect stretched exponential ) while the pds is studied for long bursts only .",
    "nevertheless , both the atp and the pds characterize the stochastic process generating grbs .",
    "stern ( 1999 ) shows that both can be reproduced simultaneously with the pulse - avalanche model of stern & svensson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the sharpness of the break in the average pds appears to be an important feature that constrains models of grbs .",
    "if the signal is produced in the rest frame of a relativistic outflow then variations of the outflow lorentz factor , @xmath95 , from burst to burst would smear out the break .",
    "the sharpness of the break then implies a narrow dispersion of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , which appears to be unlikely .      finally , one may associate the break with the dynamical time scale corresponding to the inner radius of the optically thin zone of the outflow , @xmath98 .",
    "then the variability on time scales shorter than @xmath99 can be suppressed . in this case , however , one should explain why @xmath100 stays the same in different bursts .",
    "it has often been hypothesized that dim bursts are at high cosmological redshifts .",
    "for instance , it is necessarily the case if grbs have approximately the same intrinsic luminosity , the so - called `` standard candle '' hypothesis .",
    "we can test this hypothesis using the power spectrum analysis .",
    "suppose that the dim bursts are intrinsically the same as the bright ones .",
    "then any difference in their average pds should be due to a cosmological redshift .",
    "first consider the bolometric light curves assuming that their average pds follows the @xmath5 power law .",
    "it is easy to see that a redshift , @xmath101 , will not change the pds slope . as we normalize each bursts to its peak before the averaging , the effect of a redshift is just stretching the light curve in time , i.e. , precisely the time dilation effect",
    "this will lead to an increase of the net normalization of the pds by a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "the slope does not change since the dilation factor @xmath103 is the same for each time scale .",
    "one should , however , recall that we observe bursts in a limited spectral interval .",
    "a redshift then implies a shift of the signal with respect to our spectral window .",
    "e.g. , photons detected in channel iii would originally have been emitted in channel iv .",
    "as we know from  5 , the pdss are different in different energy channels .",
    "therefore , one expects that the pds slope will change for redshifted grbs .",
    "we have seen in  5 that the pds of bright bursts flattens in the hard channels .",
    "hence , a redshift of the bright bursts must be accompanied by a flattening of the pds .",
    "contrary to this behavior , we observe that the pds of dim bursts _",
    "steepens_. hence , the evolution of the pds with brightness is inconsistent with the standard candle hypothesis .",
    "it implies that the burst luminosity function is broad and dim bursts are intrinsically weak .",
    "evidence for a broad luminosity function is also found when looking at the isotropic luminosities of the bursts with measured redshifts .",
    "note , however , that the differences in the apparent luminosities could be caused by orientation effects if grbs are beamed",
    ". one should not therefore exclude that the total intrinsic luminosities are approximately the same .",
    "the different temporal structure of dim bursts may be an important fact in this respect .",
    "in particular , it suggests that the observed time dilation of dim bursts ( e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1994 ) may be caused mainly by physical processes occurring in the bursts rather than by a cosmological redshift .",
    "note that the intrinsic difference of the temporal structure of dim grbs was also found when studying their average time profile ( see stern et at .",
    "the rising part of the atp does not change with decreasing brightness while the decaying part suffers from time dilation .",
    "this behavior is inconsistent with a cosmological time dilation which should apply equally to both parts of the atp .",
    "a likely scenario of grbs involves internal shocks in a relativistic outflow with a lorentz factor @xmath104 ( see , e.g. , piran 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the shock develops when an inner faster shell of the outflow tries to overtake the previous slower shell .",
    "the pulses in a burst are then associated with collisions between the shells .",
    "the pdss predicted by the model were recently tested against the observed @xmath5 law ( panaitescu , spada , & mszros 1999 ; spada , panaitescu , & mszros 2000 ; beloborodov 1999,2000 ) .",
    "the self - similar temporal structure with @xmath80 can be reproduced by the model .",
    "further constraints should , however , be imposed by the observed dependence of @xmath76 on photon energy . besides , the phase structure of the signal , neglected so far , should be taken into consideration ( beloborodov 2000 ) .",
