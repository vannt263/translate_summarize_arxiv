    "nuclear level densities are important for many aspects of fundamental and applied nuclear physics , including calculations of nuclear reaction cross sections .",
    "the level density of excited nuclei is an average quantity that is defined as the number of levels per unit energy .",
    "the majority of data for nuclear level densities are obtained from two energy regions . at low excitation energy",
    ", the level density is obtained directly from counting of low - lying levels  @xcite . as the excitation energy increases , the level density becomes large and individual levels are often not resolved in experiments .",
    "therefore , the direct counting method becomes impossible .",
    "nuclear resonances at or above the nucleon binding energy provide another source of level density data  @xcite . between these two excitation energy regions ,",
    "the level density is often interpolated using phenomenological formulas  @xcite .",
    "it is in this energy region the present measurements focus .",
    "recently , an extension of the sequential extraction method , now referred to as the oslo method , was developed by the oslo cyclotron group .",
    "the oslo method permits a simultaneous determination of the level density and the radiative strength function @xcite . for both of these quantities ,",
    "the experimental results cover an energy region where there is little information available and data are difficult to obtain .",
    "however , the limitation of this method is that the results must be normalized to existing data  from the discrete levels and neutron resonance spacings for the level density and to the total radiative width for the radiative strength function .",
    "thus , the new and main achievement of the oslo method is to establish the functional form of the level density and the radiative strength function in the above specified energy region .    in this work we present results for the level density in @xmath0sn for the excitation energy @xmath4 mev .",
    "the radiative strength functions of @xmath0sn have been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the experimental set - up is briefly described in section ii , followed by a discussion of the analysis and normalization procedure .",
    "the experimental results for the level density are given in section iii , and the determination of various thermodynamic quantities are presented in section iv .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "the experiment was carried out at the oslo cyclotron laboratory ( ocl ) using a 38-mev @xmath1he beam .",
    "the self - supporting @xmath5sn target had a thickness of 1.9 mg/@xmath6 .",
    "the reaction channels @xmath5sn(@xmath1he,@xmath7)@xmath8sn and @xmath5sn(@xmath1he,@xmath1he@xmath3)@xmath5sn were studied .",
    "the experiment ran for about 11 days with an average beam current of @xmath9 1.5 na .",
    "particle-@xmath10 coincidence events were detected using the cactus multidetector array .",
    "the charged particles were measured with eight si particle telescopes placed at 45@xmath11 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "each telescope consists of a front si @xmath12 detector with thickness 140 @xmath13 m and a back si(li ) @xmath14 detector with thickness 3000 @xmath13 m .",
    "an array of 28 collimated nai @xmath10-ray detectors with a solid - angle coverage of @xmath9 15% of 4@xmath15 was used .",
    "in addition , one ge detector was used in order to estimate the spin distribution and determine the selectivity of the reaction .",
    "the typical spin range is @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ alphasp ] shows the singles @xmath17-particle spectrum ( upper panel ) and the @xmath17-@xmath10 coincidence spectrum ( lower panel ) for @xmath8sn .",
    "the two peaks denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the transfer peaks to the ground state and the first excited state , respectively .",
    "the strong transfer peak at @xmath20 mev is composed of many states found to be the result of pick - up of high-@xmath21 neutrons from the g@xmath22 and h@xmath23 orbitals  @xcite . another strong transfer peak centered around @xmath24 mev is new and may indicate the neutron pick - up from the g@xmath25 orbital .",
    "the counts in the coincidence spectrum decrease for excitation energies higher than @xmath26 due to lower @xmath10-ray multiplicity when the neighboring @xmath27 isotope is populated at low excitation energy .",
    "-particle spectrum , and b ) @xmath17-@xmath10 coincidence spectrum from the @xmath5sn(@xmath1he , @xmath17)@xmath8sn reaction . ]",
    "the particle@xmath10-ray coincidence spectra were unfolded using the response functions for the cactus detector array  @xcite .",
    "the first - generation matrix ( the primary-@xmath10-ray matrix ) contains only the first @xmath10-rays emitted from a given excitation energy bin ; this matrix is obtained by a subtraction procedure described in ref .",
    "this procedure is justified if the @xmath10 decay from any excitation energy bin is independent of the method of formation  either directly by the nuclear reaction or indirectly by @xmath10 decay from higher lying states following the initial reaction .",
    "this assumption is clearly valid if the same states are populated via the two processes , since @xmath10-decay branching ratios are properties of levels .",
    "when different states are populated , the assumption may not hold",
    ". however , much evidence suggests  @xcite that statistical @xmath10 decay is governed only by the @xmath10-ray energy and the density of states at the final energy .    in the data analysis ,",
    "the particle-@xmath10-ray coincidence matrix is prepared and the particle energy is transformed into excitation energy using the reaction kinematics .",
    "the rows of the coincidence matrix correspond to the excitation energy in the residual nucleus , while the columns correspond to the @xmath10-ray energy .",
    "all the @xmath10-ray spectra for various initial excitation energies are unfolded using the known response functions of the cactus array  @xcite .",
    "the first - generation @xmath10-ray spectra , which consist of primary @xmath10-ray transitions , are then obtained for each excitation energy bin  @xcite .",
    "the first - generation @xmath10-ray spectra for all excitation energies form a matrix @xmath28 , hereafter referred to as the first - generation matrix .",
    "the entries of the first - generation matrix @xmath28 are the probabilities @xmath29 that a @xmath10-ray of energy @xmath30 is emitted from an excitation energy @xmath14 .",
    "this matrix is the basis for the simultaneous extraction of the radiative strength function and the level density . according to the brink - axel hypothesis  @xcite ,",
    "a giant electric dipole resonance can be built on every excited state with the same properties as the one built on the ground state , that is , the radiative strength function is independent of excitation energy and thus of temperature .",
    "many theoretical models do include a temperature dependence of the radiative strength function  @xcite .",
    "however , the temperature dependence is weak and the temperature change in the energy region under consideration here is rather small .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence is neglected in the oslo method .",
    "the first - generation matrix is factorized into the radiative transmission coefficient , which is dependent only on @xmath31 , and on the level density , which is a function of the excitation energy of the final states @xmath32 : @xmath33 the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are obtained iteratively by a globalized fitting procedure  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the iteration is to determine these two functions at @xmath36 energy values each ; the product of the two functions is known at @xmath37 data points contained in the first - generation matrix .",
    "the globalized fitting to the data points determines the functional form for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the results must be normalized because the entries of the matrix @xmath28 are invariant under the transformation  @xcite @xmath38\\,\\rho(e - e_\\gamma ) , \\label{eq : array1}\\\\ \\tilde{\\cal t}(e_\\gamma)&=&b\\exp(\\alpha e_\\gamma ) { \\cal t}(e_\\gamma ) .",
    "\\label{eq : array2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the final step , the transformation parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath17 which correspond to the most physical solution must be determined .",
    "details of the normalization procedure are described in several papers reporting the results of the oslo method , see for example  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the level density and thermodynamic properties .",
    "the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath17 relevant for the nuclear level density are determined from normalizing the level density to the low - lying discrete levels and the neutron resonance spacings just above the neutron separation energy @xmath26 . for @xmath5sn",
    ", we used s- and p - wave resonance level spacings ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) taken from  @xcite to calculate the total level density at @xmath26 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on the calculation ) .",
    "since there is no experimental information about @xmath41 or @xmath42 for @xmath8sn , we estimated @xmath43 for this nucleus based on systematics for the other tin isotopes  @xcite , and assuming an uncertainty of 50% .",
    "the level spacings and the final values for @xmath43 are given in table  [ tab : egidy ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    according to the linearized free - energy calculations , the first neutron pair is broken for excitation energies between @xmath44 mev in @xmath8sn . comparing with the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] , we see that this coincides with the excitation - energy region where a peak structure is found .",
    "this bump is thought to represent the first neutron pair break - up as discussed previously in the text .",
    "the average temperature of the bump is @xmath45 mev , in excellent agreement with the deduced critical temperature @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath5sn in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] , we find that a peak - like structure with an average temperature of @xmath47 mev is present between @xmath48 mev . compared to the critical temperature @xmath49 mev , the values agree satisfactory .    for the continuous break - up process characterized by a zero potential barrier ( @xmath50 mev )",
    ", we estimate for @xmath8sn an average microcanonical temperature of @xmath51 mev in the excitation - energy region @xmath52 mev , in reasonable agreement with @xmath53 calculated from the linearized helmholtz free energy . in the case of @xmath5sn , the average microcanonical temperature for excitation energies between @xmath54 mev",
    "is found to be @xmath55 mev , which agrees very well with @xmath56 mev .",
    "this gives further confidence in our interpretation of the data as two independent methods give very similar results .",
    "the nuclear level densities for @xmath0sn are extracted from particle-@xmath10 coincidence measurements .",
    "new experimental results are reported for the level density in @xmath0sn for excitation energies above 1.5 mev and 3.5 mev up to @xmath57 mev .",
    "the level densities for both nuclei display prominent step - like structures .",
    "the structures have been further investigated by means of thermodynamic considerations : microcanonical entropy and temperature , and through calculations of the linearized helmholtz free energy .",
