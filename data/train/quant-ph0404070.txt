    "traditionally the collection of properties is considered to be a complete lattice , partially ordered by the implication of properties , with an orthocomplementation , representing the quantum generalization of the ` negation ' of a property .",
    "a state is represented by the collections of properties that are actual whenever the entity is in this state .",
    "we mention however that in these earlier approaches @xcite the mathematical structure that underlies the physical theory had not completely been identified .",
    "to identify the mathematical structure in a complete way , the structure of a state property system was introduced in @xcite .",
    "suppose that we consider a physical entity @xmath3 , and we denote its set of states by @xmath4 and its set of properties by @xmath5 .",
    "the state property system corresponding to this physical entity @xmath3 is a triple @xmath6 , where @xmath4 is the set of states of @xmath3 , @xmath5 the set of properties of @xmath3 , and @xmath7 a map from @xmath4 to @xmath8 , that makes correspond to each state @xmath9 the set of properties @xmath10 that are actual if the entity @xmath3 is in state @xmath11 .",
    "some additional requirements , that express exactly how the physicists perceives a physical entity in relation with its states and properties , are satisfied in a state property system .",

    "this means that the set of properties is partially ordered , with the physical meaning of the partial order relation @xmath18 being the following : @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 means that whenever property @xmath21 is actual for the entity @xmath3 , also property @xmath22 is actual for the entity @xmath3 .",

    "this state of affairs can be expressed equally by stating that the property @xmath33 is actual when the big entity is in state @xmath27 . hence , as a basic physical requirement of merological covariance we should have : @xmath34 this all gives rise to the following definition of morphism for state property systems .",

    "we will now introduce this category of closure spaces .",
    "a topological space consists of a set @xmath44 , and a collection of ` open ' subsets , such that @xmath44 is open , any union of open subsets is again open and any finite intersection of open subsets is again open .",

    "the concept topological space is very useful and arises in many different areas .",
    "however there are occasions when we ` almost ' have a topological space .",
    "let s take the following example .",
    "consider the plane @xmath45 and the collection of all convex subsets of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is convex if the segment between any two points of @xmath46 lies completely within @xmath46 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath47 is convex and every intersection of convex sets is again convex .",
    "however a finite union of convex sets does not need to be convex .",
    "hence the convex subsets of the plane can ` almost ' be considered as closed sets , but they do not form a topological space . to be able to consider such structures one has introduced the notion of closure spaces .    [ closure space ] [ def : clos ] a closure space @xmath48 consists of a set @xmath44 and a family of subsets satisfying the following conditions : @xmath49 the closure operator corresponding to the closure space @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 if @xmath48 and @xmath52 are closure spaces then a function @xmath53 is called a continuous map if @xmath54 .",
    "the category of closure spaces and continuous maps is denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "the following theorem shows how we can associate with each state property system a closure space and with each morphism a continuous map , hence we get the categorical equivalence described in @xcite .",
    "[ corrf ] the correspondence @xmath56 consisting of ( 1 ) the mapping @xmath57 ( 2 ) for every pair of objects @xmath58 of @xmath59 the mapping @xmath60 is a covariant functor .    we can also connect a state property system to a closure space and a morphism to a continuous map .",
    "[ corrg ] the correspondence @xmath61 consisting of ( 1 ) the mapping @xmath62 where @xmath63 ( 2 ) for every pair of objects @xmath64 of @xmath65 the mapping @xmath66 is a covariant functor .",
    "[ theor : equiv ] the functors @xmath67 @xmath68 establish an equivalence of categories .",
    "the above equivalence is a very powerful tool for studying state property systems .",
    "it states that the lattice @xmath69 of properties can be seen as the lattice of closed sets of a closure space on the states @xmath4 , conversely every closure space on @xmath44 can be considered as a set of states ( @xmath44 ) and a lattice of properties ( the lattice of closed sets ) .",
    "recall that closure spaces are in fact a generalization of topological spaces , hence a number of topological properties have been generalized to closure spaces . moreover with the previous equivalence , a concept which can be defined using closed sets on a closure space can be translated in an equivalent concept for state property systems . at first sight",
    "this translation does not need to be meaningful in the context of physical systems .",
    "however it turned out that many such translations actually coincided with well known physical concepts .",
    "we shall give one example which was studied in @xcite .",
    "a topological space is called @xmath70 if the following separation axiom is satisfied . for every two points @xmath71",
    "there are open sets which contain @xmath72 resp .",
    "@xmath73 but do not contain @xmath73 resp .",
    "this is equivalent to stating that all singletons are closed sets .",
    "hence the following definition .",
    "a closure space @xmath74 is a @xmath70 closure space iff @xmath75 .    in the theory of state property systems , or more general of property lattices the concept of atomistic lattice is quite fundamental . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that using the equivalence between state property systems and closure spaces both concepts are in fact related .",
    "let @xmath12 be a state property system .",
    "then the map @xmath76 maps a state @xmath11 to the strongest property it makes actual , i.e. @xmath77 t.f.a.e .",
    "* @xmath78 is injective and @xmath79 is an atom of @xmath69 .",
    "* @xmath80 * @xmath81 is a @xmath70 closure space .",
    "if a state property system satisfies one , and hence all of the above conditions it is called an atomistic state property system , in this case @xmath69 is a complete atomistic lattice .",
    "if we write @xmath82 for the full subcategory of @xmath65 given by @xmath70 closure spaces , and @xmath83 for the full subcategory of @xmath59 given by the atomistic state property systems , then the general equivalence can be reduced .",
    "the functors @xmath84 @xmath85 establish an equivalence of categories .    for a more extensive study of separation axioms and their relation with state property systems we refer to @xcite . in the present text",
    "our final aim is to use the described equivalence to translate the concept of connectedness in closure spaces into terms of state property systems .",
    "it will give us a means to distinguish ` classical ' and ` quantum mechanical ' properties of a physical entity .",
    "first we will need a more precise concept of classical property .",
    "in this section we start to distinguish the classical aspects of the structure from the quantum aspects . we all know that the concept of superposition state is very important in quantum mechanics .",
    "the superposition states are the states that do not exist in classical physics and hence their appearance is one of the important quantum aspects . to be able to define properly a superposition state we need the linearity of the set of states . on the level of generality that we work now",
    ", we do not necessarily have this linearity , which could indicate that the concept of superposition state can not be given a meaning on this level of generality .",
    "this is however not really true : the concept can be traced back within this general setting , by introducing the idea of ` superselection rule ' .",
    "two properties are separated by a superselection rule iff there do not exist ` superposition states ' related to these two properties .",
    "this concept will be the first step towards a characterization of classical properties of a physical system .",
    "[ super selection rule ] consider a state property system @xmath12 .",

    "amazingly we find that properties that are ` separated by a superselection rule ' ( i.e. they are ` classical ' properties in a certain sense ) correspond to closed sets that also behave in a classical way , where classical now refers to classical topology .",

    "@xmath113    this theorem shows that the properties that are separated by a super selection rule are exactly the ones that behave also classically within the closure system . in the sense that their set theoretical unions are closed .",

    "the corresponding closure space @xmath115 is a topological space .    a state property satisfying one , and",

    "we are ready now to introduce the concept of a ` deterministic classical property ' or ` d - classical property ' . to make clear what we mean by this we have to explain shortly how properties are tested .",

    "if the state @xmath11 of @xmath3 is such that we can predict with certainty that the outcome ` no ' will occur , we test in some way a complementary property of the property @xmath21 , let us denote the complementary property by @xmath120 .",
    "now we have three possibilities : ( 1 ) the state of @xmath3 is such that @xmath119 gives ` yes ' with certainty ; ( 2 ) the state of @xmath3 is such that @xmath119 gives ` no ' with certainty ; and ( 3 ) the state of @xmath3 is such that neither the outcome ` yes ' nor the outcome ` no ' is certain for the experiment @xmath119 .",
    "the third case represents the situations of ` quantum indeterminism ' .",
    "that is the reason that a property @xmath21 tested by an experiment @xmath119 where the third case is absent will be called a ` deterministic classical ' property or ` d - classical ' property .",
