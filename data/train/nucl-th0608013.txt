    "dense matter studies have opened up new dimensions in understanding the nature and behavioral aspects of nuclear matter at extremes .",
    "an ideal laboratory for such studies can be neutron stars , which contains matter around ten times denser than atomic nuclei .",
    "these compact stars are believed to be made in the aftermath of type ii supernova explosions resulting from the gravitational core collapse of massive stars .",
    "all known forces of nature i.e , strong , weak , electromagnetic and gravitational , play key roles in the formation , evolution and the composition of these stars . thus the study of dense matter not only deals with astrophysical problems such as the evolution of neutron stars , the supernovae mechanism but also reviews the implications from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "neutron stars are charge neutral , and the fact that charge neutrality drives the stellar matter away from isospin - symmetric nuclear matter , the study of neutron stars lends important clues in understanding the isospin dependence of nuclear forces . due to @xmath1-stability conditions",
    ", neutron star is much closer to neutron matter than the symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "however , with increasing densities , the fermi energy of the occupied baryon states reaches eigenenergies of other species such as @xmath2(1116 ) , @xmath3(1193 ) and @xmath4(1318 ) and the possibility of these hyperonic states are speculated in the dense core of neutron stars ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "studies on hypernuclei experiments suggests the presence of hyperons in dense matter such as neutron stars .",
    "theoretically also , it has been found that the inclusion of hyperons in neutron star cores lowers the energy and pressure of the system resulting in the lowering of the maximum mass of neutron stars , in the range of observational limits .",
    "various hadronic models have been applied to describe the structure of neutron stars .",
    "non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic models ( @xcite-@xcite ) predict nearly same maximum mass of neutron star .",
    "relativistic models have been successfully applied to study finite nuclei @xcite and infinite nuclear matter @xcite where they not only satisfy the properties of nuclear matter at saturation but also the extrapolation to high density is automatically causal .",
    "field theories such as the non - linear @xmath5 model @xcite have been phenomenal in this respect .",
    "presently we apply an effective hadronic model to study the equation of state ( eos ) for neutron star matter in the mean - field type approach @xcite . along with non - linear terms , which ensure reasonable saturation properties of nuclear matter ,",
    "the model embodies dynamical generation of the vector meson mass that ensures a reasonable incompressibility .",
    "therefore , one of the motivation for the present study is to check the applicability of the model to the study of high density matter .",
    "secondly , the parameter sets of the model are in accordance with recently obtained heavy - ion data @xcite . with varying incompressibility and effective nucleon mass the study can impart vital information about their dependency and the underlying effect on the resulting eos . also the existing knowledge on the presence of hyperons in the dense core of these compact stars is inadequate , largely because the coupling strength of these hyperons are unknown .",
    "so it would be interesting to see the effect of hyperons in the dense core of neutron stars and the predictive power of the present model in establishing the global properties of the resulting neutron star sequences .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : first we give a brief description of the ingredients of the hadronic model that we implement in our calculations . after introducing the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations for the static star , we present some general features of the equation of state and then look at the gross properties of the neutron stars in our calculations and compare our results with the observed masses of the neutron stars , and also with predictions from some of the field - theoretical models .",
    "we then discuss a few constraints on the neutron star mass and radius imposed by recent estimates of the gravitational redshift in the m - r plane .",
    "finally we conclude with outlook on the possible extensions of the current approach .",
    "we start with an effective lagrangian generalized to include all the baryonic octets interacting through mesons :    @xmath6~ \\psi_b \\nonumber \\\\ & &          + \\frac{1}{2}\\big(\\partial_\\mu\\vec \\pi\\cdot\\partial^\\mu\\vec\\pi          + \\partial_{\\mu } \\sigma \\partial^{\\mu } \\sigma\\big )          - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\big(x^2 - x^2_0\\big)^2          - \\frac{\\lambda b}{6}\\big(x^2 - x^2_0\\big)^3          - \\frac{\\lambda c}{8}\\big(x^2 - x^2_0\\big)^4 \\nonumber \\\\ & &       - \\frac{1}{4 } f_{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\mu\\nu }          + \\frac{1}{2}{g_{\\omega b}}^{2}x^2 \\omega_{\\mu}\\omega^{\\mu }          - \\frac { 1}{4}{\\vec r}_{\\mu\\nu}\\cdot{\\vec r}^{\\mu\\nu }          + \\frac{1}{2}m^2_{\\rho}{\\vec \\rho}_{\\mu}\\cdot{\\vec \\rho}^{\\mu}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the baryon spinor , @xmath10 is the pseudoscalar - isovector pion field , @xmath11 is the scalar field .",
    "the subscript @xmath12 and @xmath13 , denotes for baryons .",
    "the terms in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) with the subscript @xmath14 should be interpreted as sum over the states of all baryonic octets . in this model for hadronic matter ,",
    "the baryons interact via the exchange of the @xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath16-meson .",
    "the lagrangian includes a dynamically generated mass of the isoscalar vector field , @xmath17 , that couples to the conserved baryonic current @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned only with the normal non - pion condensed state of matter , so we take @xmath19 and also the pion mass @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction of the scalar and the pseudoscalar mesons with the vector boson generate the mass through the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "then the masses of the baryons , scalar and vector mesons , which are generated through @xmath21 , are respectively given by @xmath22 in the above , @xmath21 is the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath11 field , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , the pion mass and @xmath25 the pion decay constant , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the coupling constants for the vector and scalar fields , respectively . in the mean - field treatment",
    "we ignore the explicit role of @xmath28 mesons .",
    "the dirac equation for baryons is the euler - lagrange equation of @xmath29 and is obtained as @xmath30\\psi_b=0\\ .\\ ] ] the mass term in the above equation appears in the form @xmath31 , which is referred to as the effective baryon mass , @xmath32 .",
    "we will now proceed to calculate the equation of motion for the scalar field .",
    "the scalar field dependent terms from the lagrangian density are :    @xmath33    where in the mean - field limit @xmath15 = @xmath34 . the constant parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are included in the higher - order self - interaction of the scalar field to describe the desirable values of nuclear matter properties at saturation point . using equation ( 2 ) and @xmath37 , the above expression divided by @xmath38 becomes    @xmath39    differentiating with respect to @xmath40 , we have the equation of motion for the scalar field including all baryons as :    @xmath41=0\\ , \\label{effmass}\\ ] ]    where the effective mass of the baryonic species is @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the usual scalar and vector coupling constants respectively .",
    "it should be noted that although the term @xmath45 in the lagrangian does not appear explicitly in eqn .",
    "( 6 ) , however the effect is there through the mass term , following equation ( 2 ) and through @xmath21 .    for a baryon species ,",
    "the scalar density ( @xmath46 ) and the baryon density ( @xmath47 ) are , @xmath48 @xmath49 the equation of motion for the @xmath15 field is then calculated as @xmath50 the quantity @xmath51 is the fermi momentum for the baryon and @xmath52 is the spin degeneracy",
    ". similarly , the equation of motion for the @xmath53meson is obtained as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the 3rd - component of the isospin of each baryon species ( given in the table ii ) .",
    "traditionally , neutron stars were believed to be composed mostly of neutrons , some of which eventually @xmath1-decay until an equilibrium between neutron , proton and electron is reached .",
    "the respective chemical potentials then satisfy the generic relationship , @xmath56 , among them . along with charge neutrality condition , @xmath57 , the various particle composition",
    "is then determined and the neutron star is believed to be composed of neutrons , protons and electrons .",
    "muons come into picture when @xmath58 , which happens roughly around nuclear matter density , and the charge neutrality condition is altered to @xmath59 .",
    "hyperons can form in neutron star cores when the nucleon chemical potential is large enough to compensate the mass differences between nucleon and hyperons , which happens roughly around two times normal nuclear matter density , when the first species of the hyperon family starts appearing .",
    "the neutron and electron chemical potentials are constrained by the requirements of conservation of total baryon number and the charge neutrality condition given by , @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the baryon and lepton densities respectively .",
    "these two conditions combine to determine the appearance and concentration of these particles in the dense core of compact objects .",
    "a general expression may be written down for each baryonic chemical potentials ( @xmath63 ) in terms of these two independent chemical potentials , i.e. , @xmath64 and @xmath65 as , @xmath66 where @xmath63 and @xmath67 are the chemical potentials and electric charge of the concerned baryon species .",
    "after achieving the solution to these conditions , one obtains the total energy density @xmath68 and pressure p for a given baryon density as :    @xmath69    @xmath70    as explained earlier , the terms in eqns .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) with the subscript @xmath14 should be interpreted as sum over the states of all baryonic octets .",
    "the meson field equations ( ( 6 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ) are then solved self - consistently at a fixed baryon density to obtain the respective fields along with the requirements of conservation of total baryon number and charge neutrality condition given in equation ( 12 ) and the energy and pressure is computed for the neutron star matter . using the computed eos for the neutron star sequences ,",
    "we calculate the properties of neutron stars .",
    "the equations for the structure of a relativistic spherical and static star composed of a perfect fluid were derived from einstein s equations by oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath71 \\left[m+4\\pi r^3 p\\right ] } { ( r-2 gm ) } , \\label{tov1}\\ ] ] @xmath72 with @xmath73 as the gravitational constant and @xmath74 as the enclosed gravitational mass .",
    "we have used @xmath75 . given an eos , these equations can be integrated from the origin as an initial value problem for a given choice of central energy density , @xmath76 . the value of @xmath77 , where the pressure vanishes defines the surface of the star .",
    "we solve the above equations to study the structural properties of the neutron star , using the eos derived for the electrically charge neutral hyperon rich dense matter .",
    "the parameter set for the present model is listed in table-1 , which is in accordance with recently obtained heavy - ion collision data . with varying effective masses",
    "@xmath78 and incompressibility ( @xmath79 mev ) , the study can give us informations on nuclear equation of state and its effect on the properties of neutron stars .",
    "the parameter sets satisfies the nuclear saturation properties , @xmath80 , energy per nucleon , @xmath81 mev at saturation density @xmath82 , effective nucleon landau mass @xmath83 , incompressibility , and asymmetry energy coefficient value ( @xmath84 mev ) , so that our extrapolation to higher density remains meaningful .",
    "we fix the coupling constant @xmath85 by requiring that @xmath86 correspond to the empirical value , 32 @xmath87 6 mev@xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath88 for @xmath86=32 mev .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the gravitational redshift interpreted by the @xmath89 ratio comes out to be in the range @xmath90=0.12 - 0.23 , which is plotted in figure 14 . for set i , ii and iii ,",
    "the redshift is nearly same because redshift primarily depends on the mass to radius ratio of the star , which in case of first three sets is nearly same .",
    "for all the parameter sets , the redshift obtained at maximum mass lies in the range @xmath91 , which corresponds to @xmath92 km/@xmath93 .",
    "our calculations predicts @xmath94 in the range @xmath95 km/@xmath93 , which is consistent with the observed value .",
    "the predictive power of the model is evident from figure 14 , where we compare the gravitational redshift as a function of the star mass for the five parameter sets",
    ". the overall results of our calculation are presented in table 3 .",
    "we studied the equation of state of high density matter in an effective model and calculated the gross properties for neutron stars like mass , radius , central density and redshift .",
    "we analysed five set of parameters with incompressibility values @xmath96=210 , 300 and 380 mev and effective masses @xmath97 = 0.80 , 0.85 and 0.90 @xmath98 , that satisfies the nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "the results are then compared with some recent observations and also a few field theoretical models .",
    "it was found that the difference in nuclear incompressibility is not much reflected in either equation of state or neutron star properties , but nucleon effective masses were quite decisive . at maximum mass , the central density of the star for sets i , ii",
    ", iii and iv was found to be @xmath99 ( nuclear matter density ) but for set v , it was found to be @xmath100 , which has the highest effective mass value .",
    "similarly the maximum mass obtained for the the five eos lies in the range 1.21 - 1.96@xmath93 .",
    "set v , which is softest among all parameter sets , predicts lowest maximum mass 1.21@xmath93 , whereas set iv ( stiff ) predicts the maximum mass to be 1.96@xmath93 and also is the star with the largest radius .",
    "the difference in maximum mass and radius of the star in case of set i , ii and iii is negligible , and so the predicted redshift comes out nearly same , whereas set iv and v presents the two extremes in overall properties , which is the reflection of their different effective mass values .",
    "overall , mass predicted by all the parameter sets agree well with most of the theoretical work and observational limits .",
    "the results were also found to be in good agreement with recently imposed constrains on neutron star properties in the m  r plane , and the redshift interpreted therein .",
    "further , the precise measurements of mass of both neutron stars in case of psr b1913 + 16 @xcite , psr b1534 + 12 @xcite and psr b2127 + 11c @xcite are available which can put constrains on the nuclear equation of state",
    ". masses of neutron stars in x - ray pulsars are also consistent with these values , although are measured less accurately . in case of radii , the values are still unknown , however some estimates are expected in a few years , which would further constrain the eos of neutron star in the m - r plane . in future",
    ", we intend to study the effect of rotation to neutron star structure and also the phase transition aspects in the model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings is very much successful in non - linear walecka model@xcite and similar work in this direction would be interesting .",
