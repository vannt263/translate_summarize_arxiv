    "during last decade the various experimental collaborations reported on observation of hadronic states , which can not be described as the traditional hadrons composed of two or three valence quarks . indeed , starting from the discovery of the @xmath14 state by the belle collaboration @xcite ( see , also ref .",
    "@xcite ) measurements of various annihilation , collision and decay processes lead to valuable experimental data on the @xmath15 family of exotic particles .",
    "situation with the theoretical models , computational methods and schemes proposed to explain observed features of the exotic states is more complicated .",
    "one of the essential problems here is revealing the quark - gluon structure of the exotic hadrons .",
    "thus , in accordance with existing theoretical models the exotic hadrons are four - quark ( tetraquarks ) , five - quark ( pentaquarks ) states , or contain as constituents valence gluons ( hybrids , glueballs ) .",
    "the second question is the internal quark - gluon organization and new constituents ( diquarks , antidiquarks , conventional mesons , etc . ) of the exotic hadrons , as well as a nature of the forces binding them into compact states .",
    "finally , one has to determine computational methods , which can be applied to carry out qualitative analysis these multi - quark systems . in other words , one needs to adapt to the exotic hadrons the well known methods , which were successfully used to explore conventional mesons and baryons , and/or to invent approaches to solve newly emerged problems typical for the exotic states .",
    "we have only outlined variety of problems arising when exploring the exotic hadrons . a rather detailed information on these theoretical methods and also on collected experimental data can be found in numerous review papers refs.swanson:2006st,klempt:2007cp,godfrey:2008nc,voloshin:2007dx,nielsen:2010,faccini:2012pj , esposito:2014rxa , meyer:2015eta , chen:2016qju , lebed:2016hpi , including most recent ones @xcite , and in references therein .",
    "most of the observed tetraquark states belong to the class of so - called hidden charm or bottom particles containing the @xmath16 or @xmath17 pair .",
    "but , first principles of qcd do not forbid existence of the open charm ( or bottom ) or open charm - bottom tetraquarks .",
    "experimental information concerning the open charm tetraquarks is restricted by the observed @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons , which are considered as candidates for such exotic states .",
    "these particles were explored both as the diquark - antidiquark states and molecules built of the conventional mesons .",
    "the only candidate to the open bottom tetraquark is @xmath20 state , which is also considering as the first particle containing four valence quarks of different flavors . but experimental status of this particle remains controversial and unclear .",
    "thus , the evidence for this resonance was reported by the d0 collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite , later conformed from analysis of the semileptonic decays of @xmath21 meson in ref .",
    "d0 . at the same time",
    ", lhcb and cms collaborations could not prove an existence of this state on the basis of relevant experimental data [ refs.@xcite ] .",
    "numerous theoretical studies of @xmath20 state also suffer from contradictory conclusions ranging from conforming its parameters measured by the d0 collaboration till explaining the observed experimental output by some alternative effects .",
    "avoiding here further details , we refer to original works addressed various aspects of the @xmath20 physics , and also to the review paper devoted to the open charm and bottom mesons [ ref.@xcite ] .",
    "the open charm - bottom tetraquarks form the next class of the exotic particles .",
    "it is worth noting they have not been discovered experimentally , and to our best knowledge , there are not under consideration candidates for these states .",
    "nevertheless , the open charm - bottom states attracted already interest of theorists , which performed their analysis within both the molecule [ refs .  zhang:2009vs , zhang:2009em , sun:2012sy , albuquerque:2012rq ] and diquark - antidiquark pictures [ refs .",
    "zouzou:1986qh , silvestrebrac:1993ry , chen:2013aba ] of the tetraquark model .",
    "thus , in ref .  @xcite the authors considered the scalar and axial - vector open charm - bottom tetraquarks and calculated their masses by means of qcd two - point sum rules . in this article some possible decay channels of these states",
    "are emphasized , as well .    in the present work we are going to study the scalar open charm - bottom exotic states @xmath1[\\bar{b}\\bar{q}]$ ] and",
    "@xmath2[\\bar{b}\\bar{s}]$ ] built of the diquarks @xmath22,\\,[cs]$ ] and antidiquarks @xmath23,\\,[% \\bar{b}\\bar{s}]$ ] , where @xmath24 is one of the light @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks . first we calculate the masses , meson - current couplings of these still hypothetical tetraquarks . to this end",
    ", we utilize qcd two - point sum rule approach , which is one of the powerful nonperturbative methods to calculate the parameters of the hadrons @xcite .",
    "originally proposed to find masses , decay constants , form factors of the conventional mesons and baryons , it was successfully applied to analyze also exotic tetraquark states , glueballs and hybrid @xmath27 resonances in refs .",
    "the qcd two - point sum rule method remains among the fruitful computational tools high energy physics to investigate the exotic states .",
    "next , we use obtained by this way parameters of the open charm - bottom tetraquarks to explore the strong vertices @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 and calculate the corresponding couplings @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 necessary for evaluating the widths of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 decays . for these purposes ,",
    "we employ qcd light - cone sum method and soft - meson approximation suggested and elaborated in refs .",
    "braun:1989,ioffe:1983ju , braun:1995 .",
    "this method in conjunction with the soft - meson approximation was adapted for investigation of the strong vertices consisting of a tetraquark and two conventional mesons in ref.@xcite .",
    "later it was applied to calculate the decay width of the @xmath20 resonance and its charmed partner state ( see , refs .",
    "agaev:2016ijz , agaev:2016lkl , agaev:2016urs ) .",
    "the full version of the light - cone method was employed to analyze the strong vertices containing two tetraquarks , as well as to compute the magnetic moment some of the four - quark states in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the present work is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] we calculate the masses and meson - current couplings of the scalar open charm - bottom tetraquarks .",
    "here we also compare our results with predictions made in other papers .",
    "section [ sec : width ] is devoted to computation of the strong couplings corresponding to the vertices @xmath28 , @xmath37 and @xmath30 . in this section",
    "we calculate the widths of the decay modes @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 .",
    "it contains also our brief conclusions .",
    "to evaluate the masses and meson - current couplings of the diquark - antidiquark @xmath1[\\bar{b}\\bar{q}]$ ] and @xmath2[\\bar{b}\\bar{% s}]$ ] states we use the two - point qcd sum rules .",
    "we present explicitly expressions necessary for computing the mass and meson - current coupling in the case of the exotic @xmath13 state .",
    "the similar formulas for the particle @xmath39 can be easily obtained from these formulas .",
    "the scalar tetraquark state @xmath2[\\bar{b}\\bar{s}]$ ] can be modeled using various interpolating currents [ ref .",
    "@xcite ] . to carry out required calculations we choose the interpolating current in the form",
    "@xmath40which is symmetric under exchange of the color indices @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 is the charge conjugation matrix . for simplicity , in what follows",
    "we omit the superscript in the expressions .",
    "the correlation function for the current @xmath43 is given as @xmath44 to derive qcd sum rule expressions for mass and meson - current coupling the correlation function has to be calculated using both the physical and quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "we compute the function @xmath45 by suggesting , that the tetraquarks under consideration are the ground states in the relevant hadronic channels . after saturating the correlation function with a complete set of the @xmath46 state and performing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrf1 ] ) integral over @xmath47 , we get the required expression for @xmath45 @xmath48where @xmath49 is the mass of the @xmath13 state , and dots stand for contributions of the higher resonances and continuum states .",
    "we define the meson - current coupling by the equality@xmath50then in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath51 the correlation function takes the simple form @xmath52it contains only one term , which is proportional to the identity matrix , and , therefore , can be replaced by the invariant function @xmath53 .",
    "the borel transformation applied to these invariant function yields@xmath54    in order to obtain the function @xmath55 using the quark - gluon degrees of freedom , i.e. by employing the light and heavy propagators , we substitute the interpolating current given by eq .",

    "but the spectral density of the vertex @xmath83 is proportional to @xmath84 , which numerically is considerably smaller that @xmath85 entering into @xmath86 .",
