    "nuclear physicists are hardly surprised by the fact that in low - energy compton scattering @xmath1 , the nucleon is not a point - like spin-@xmath2 target with some anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "in fact , these nucleon structure effects have been known for many decades and ( in the case of a proton target ) quite reliable theoretical calculations for the deviations from the powell - cross section exist .",
    "they are canonically parameterised starting from the most general interaction between the nucleon and an electro - magnetic field of fixed , non - zero energy @xmath3 : @xmath4\\;+    \\;\\frac{1}{6}\\;\\bigg[{\\alpha_{e2}(\\omega)}\\;e_{ij}^2\\;+    \\;\\beta_{m2}(\\omega)\\;b_{ij}^2\\bigg ]       \\\\&\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;    \\label{polsfromints }    + \\;\\bigg[{\\gamma_{e1e1}(\\omega ) }    \\;\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot(\\vec{e}\\times\\dot{\\vec{e}})\\ ;    + \\;{\\gamma_{m1m1}(\\omega ) }    \\;\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot(\\vec{b}\\times\\dot{\\vec{b } } ) \\\\&\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;    -\\;2{\\gamma_{m1e2}(\\omega)}\\;\\sigma_i\\;b_j\\;e_{ij}\\;+    \\;2{\\gamma_{e1m2}(\\omega)}\\;\\sigma_i\\;e_j\\;b_{ij } \\bigg ] \\;+\\;\\dots     \\bigg\\}\\;n^\\dagger n\\end{split}\\ ] ] here , the electric or magnetic ( @xmath5 ) photon undergoes a transition @xmath6 of definite multipolarity @xmath7 ; @xmath8 . thus , there are six dipole polarisabilities : two spin - independent ones ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) for electric and magnetic dipole transitions which do not couple to the nucleon spin ; and in the spin sector , two diagonal ( `` pure '' ) spin - polarisabilities ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , and two off - diagonal ( `` mixed '' ) spin - polarisabilities , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in addition , there are higher ones like quadrupole and octupole polarisabilities , with negligible contributions , see next section .",
    "each of these quantities parameterises the global stiffness of the nucleon s internal degrees of freedom against displacement in an electric or magnetic field of definite multipolarity and non - vanishing frequency @xmath3 .",
    "they are energy - dependent because different mechanisms ( low - lying nuclear resonances like the @xmath15 , the charged meson cloud around the nucleon etc . )",
    "react quite differently to real photon fields of non - zero frequency .",
    "therefore , these _ dynamical polarisabilities _",
    "contain detailed information about dispersive effects , caused by internal relaxation , baryonic resonances and mesonic production thresholds .",
    "nucleon compton scattering provides thus a wealth of information about the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "however , in contradistinction to many other electro - magnetic processes ",
    "e.g.  pion photo - production off a nucleon  the nucleon structure effects probed in compton scattering in most of the recent analyses have not been analysed in terms of a multipole expansion . instead , most experiments have focused on just two structure parameters , namely the static electric and magnetic polarisabilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , at present , quite different theoretical frameworks are able to provide a consistent , qualitative picture for the leading static polarisabilities .",
    "their dynamical origin is however only properly revealed by their energy - dependence , which varies from model to model .",
    "even less is known about the spin - polarisabilities , see sect .",
    "a rigorous definition of the energy - dependent or dynamical polarisabilities starts instead of ( [ polsfromints ] ) from the six independent amplitudes into which the @xmath18-matrix of real compton scattering is decomposed : @xmath19\\\\    & + { \\mathrm{i}}\\,a_6(\\omega , z)\\,\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot    \\left[\\left(\\vec{\\epsilon}\\,'^*\\times\\hat{\\vec{k}}'\\right)\\ ,      \\vec{\\epsilon}\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{k } } ' -\\left(\\vec{\\epsilon }        \\times\\hat{\\vec{k } } \\right)\\ ,      \\vec{\\epsilon}\\,'^*\\cdot\\hat{\\vec{k}}\\right ] \\end{split }   \\label{tmatrix}\\ ] ] here , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the unit vector in the momentum direction of the incoming ( outgoing ) photon with polarisation @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we separate these amplitudes into a pole and non - pole or structure ( @xmath24 ) part .",
    "intuitively , one could define the pole part as the one which leads to the powell cross section of a point - line nucleon with anomalous magnetic moment and thus parameterises all we hope to have understood about the nucleon .",
    "then , it would seem , the structure part contains all information about the internal degrees of freedom which make the nucleon an extended , polarisable object",
    ". however , the question which part a contribution belongs to can not be answered uniquely . in the following ,",
    "only those terms which have a pole either in the @xmath25- , @xmath26- or @xmath27-channel are treated as non - structure . in the calculation of observables ,",
    "this separation is clearly irrelevant because both the structure dependent and structure independent part contribute . here",
    ", however , we investigate the rle of the internal nucleonic degrees of freedom on the polarisabilities , which are contained only in the structure part of the amplitudes .",
    "we also choose to work in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "thus , @xmath3 denotes the cm energy of the photon , @xmath28 the nucleon mass , @xmath29 the total cm - energy , and @xmath30 the cm - scattering angle , @xmath31 .",
    "following older work on the multipole - decomposition of the compton amplitudes and pulling a kinematical factor out relative to ( [ polsfromints ] ) , one obtains for the expansion of the _ structure parts _ of the amplitudes in terms of polarisabilities @xmath32\\,\\omega^2+\\dots   , \\nonumber    \\\\[1ex ]    \\bar{a}_2(\\omega,\\,z ) & \\textstyle    = -\\frac{4\\pi\\,w}{m}\\,\\beta_{m1}(\\omega)\\,\\omega^2    + \\dots   , \\nonumber    \\\\[1ex ]    \\bar{a}_3(\\omega,\\,z )    & \\textstyle=-\\frac{4\\pi\\,w}{m}\\,\\left[\\gamma_{e1e1}(\\omega )      + z\\,\\gamma_{m1m1}(\\omega)+\\gamma_{e1m2}(\\omega )      + z\\,\\gamma_{m1e2}(\\omega)\\right]\\,\\omega^3+\\dots   , \\nonumber    \\\\[1ex ]    \\bar{a}_4(\\omega,\\,z ) & \\textstyle=\\frac{4\\pi\\ ,      w}{m}\\,\\left[-\\gamma_{m1m1}(\\omega )      + \\gamma_{m1e2}(\\omega)\\right]\\,\\omega^3+\\dots   , \\label{eq : strucamp } \\\\[1ex ] \\bar{a}_5(\\omega,\\,z ) & \\textstyle=\\frac{4\\pi\\ ,    w}{m}\\,\\gamma_{m1m1}(\\omega)\\,\\omega^3    + \\dots   , \\nonumber      \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\bar{a}_6(\\omega,\\,z ) = \\frac{4\\pi\\ ,      w}{m}\\,\\gamma_{e1m2}(\\omega)\\,\\omega^3+\\dots   \\ ] ] the various polarisabilities are thus identified _ at fixed energy _ only by their different angular dependence .",
    "clearly , the complete set of dynamical polarisabilities does not contain more or less information about the temporal response or dispersive effects of the nucleonic degrees of freedom than the un - truncated amplitudes .",
    "however , the information is more readily accessible : we will be able to see directly which physics can be found in which polarisability .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that all polarisabilities beyond the dipole ones can be dropped in ( [ eq : strucamp ] ) , as they are so far invisible in observables .",
    "this is why they were sacrificed to brevity in the expressions above .",
    "purists consider ref .",
    "which energy - dependent effects can we expect ? polarising the pion cloud around the nucleon should result in a characteristic cusp as one approaches the one - pion production threshold .",
    "it is also well - known that the @xmath15 as the lowest nuclear resonance leads to a large para - magnetic contribution to the static magnetic dipole polarisability  ] @xmath33 $ ] due to its strong @xmath34 transition .",
    "a characteristic resonance shape should occur , like predicted by the lorentz model of polarisabilities in classical electro - dynamics .",
    "as the observed static value @xmath35 is smaller by a factor of @xmath36 to @xmath37 than the @xmath38 contribution , some other mechanism must provide a strong dia - magnetic component .",
    "the resultant fine - tuning at zero photon energy is unlikely to hold once we consider the evolution of the polarisabilities as a function of the photon energy : if dia- and para - magnetism are of different origin , it is more than likely that they involve different scales and hence different energy - dependences . therefore , they are apt to be dis - entangled when one extends static polarisabilities to the non - zero energy range , i.e.  to the _ dynamical polarisabilities_.        to identify the microscopically dominant low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon in a model - independent way , we employ the chiral effective field theory ( @xmath39eft ) of qcd in the one - nucleon system .",
    "this extension of chiral perturbation theory to the few - nucleon sector contains only the observable low - energy degrees of freedom , interacting in all ways allowed by the underlying symmetries of qcd .",
    "a power counting allows for results of finite , systematically improvable accuracy , and thus an error estimate .",
    "the contributions at leading - one - loop order are , see fig .  1 : photons coupling to the pion cloud around the nucleon and the @xmath38 , and excitation of the @xmath38 as intermediate state by the @xmath40-coupling @xmath41 .",
    "finally , all short - distance physics not generated by these degrees of freedom is sub - sumed into two low - energy coefficients @xmath42 , which are _ energy - independent_. @xmath39eft also predicts that the proton and neutron polarisabilities are very similar , iso - vectorial effects being higher order in the power counting .    [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the three constants @xmath41 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are determined by fitting the un - expanded , complete @xmath39eft - amplitude to the cornucopia of compton scattering data on the proton , cf .",
    "fig .  2 .",
    "table  1 shows that the results are in good agreement with state - of - the - art results from dispersion theory  @xcite , with comparable error bars .",
    "the value of @xmath45 from the three - parameter - fit is consistent within error bars with the baldin sum rule for the proton , @xmath46 .",
    "one can therefore in a second step use the value of the baldin sum rule as additional data point and reduce the number of free parameters to two , as done in the following .",
    "the value for @xmath41 is also consistent with the one obtained from the radiative @xmath38-decay - width .",
    "albeit a nave dimensional estimate predicts the two short - distance parameters to be small in magnitude , @xmath47 , they are anomalously large , @xmath48 , justifying their inclusion at leading order . as expected , @xmath44 is dia - magnetic",
    ".     +    as the influence of the quadrupole and higher polarisabilities on cross sections and asymmetries for energies up to about @xmath49 is hardly visible , cf .  figs .  2 and 4 , truncating the multipole expansion in ( [ eq : strucamp ] ) is justified .    with the parameters now fixed , the energy - dependence of all polarisabilities is predicted .",
    "we compare with a result from dispersion theory , in which the energy - dependent effects are sub - sumed into integrals over experimental input from a different kinematical rgime , namely photo - absorption cross - section @xmath50 .",
    "its major source of error is the insufficient neutron data , and the uncertainty in modelling the high - energy behaviour of the dispersive integral .",
    "the dipole polarisabilities , fig .  3 , show the behaviour expected above .",
    "the strong energy - dependence induced by the @xmath38-resonance into the polarisabilities containing an @xmath51 photon reveals the good quantitative agreement between the measured value of @xmath52 and the prediction in a @xmath39eft without explicit @xmath38 as accidental . for the first time",
    ", one sees the unique @xmath38 signature of a resonance - shape in @xmath10 even well below the pion production threshold .",
    "while the fine details of the rising para - magnetism differ between @xmath39eft and dispersion theory , they are consistent within the uncertainties of the @xmath39eft curve .",
    "the discrepancy between the two schemes above the one - pion production threshold is likely to be connected to a detailed treatment of the width of the @xmath38-resonance , which is neglected in leading - one - loop @xmath39eft .",
    "the pion - cusp  so pronounced in the @xmath53-polarisabilities  is quantitatively reproduced at leading order already .",
    "the spin - polarisabilities are predictions , three of them being completely independent of the parameter - determination .",
    "no genuinely new low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon are missing . since the mixed spin - polarisabilities ( lower panel of fig .  3 ) are small , the uncertainties of both dispersion theory and @xmath39eft are large there .",
    "more on that in the next section .     +    while the static polarisabilities of the nucleon are real , the dynamical polarisabilities become complex once the energy in the intermediate state is high enough to create an on - shell intermediate state , the first being the physical @xmath54 intermediate state , see  @xcite .    the two short - distance parameters",
    "@xmath42 which sub - sume all physics not generated by the pion cloud or the @xmath38 suffice to describe the polarisabilities up to energies of @xmath49 when the finite width of the @xmath38 is included . therefore , three constraints arise on any attempt to explain them microscopically :    * the effect must be @xmath3-independent over a wide range , like @xmath42 .",
    "* it must occur in the electric and magnetic scalar polarisabilities , leading to the values for @xmath42 predicted in @xmath39eft , but it must be absent in the pure spin - polarisabilities @xmath55 . * its prediction for the proton and neutron must be very similar , because iso - vectorial effects were shown to be small and energy - independent  @xcite .",
    "two proposals to explain @xmath42 were put forward , see right side of fig .  1 .",
    "one attributes them to an interplay between short - distance physics and the pion cloud occuring from the next - to - leading order chiral lagrangean  @xcite ; the other to the @xmath27-channel exchange of a meson or correlated two - pion exchange  @xcite .",
    "whether either of these gives a convincing quantitative description of the short - distance coefficients is not clear yet .",
    "most experiments to determine polarisabilities are performed by compton scattering off protons and light nuclei at photon energies of @xmath56 .",
    "3 shows that there , dynamical effects are large and one can not just taylor - expand the polarisabilities around their zero - photon - energy value . especially at large backward angle , unpolarised and",
    "polarised cross - sections are rather sensitive to the non - analytical structure of the amplitude around the pion cusp and @xmath38-resonance , see figs .  2 and 4 , and  @xcite .",
    "the dipole spin - polarisabilities are anything but negligible , even in un - polarised experiments .",
    "while our knowledge about the ( static ) spin - independent polarisabilities is rich , little information exists at present on the nucleonic spin - polarisabilities , which parameterise the response of the nucleon _ spin _ and its dominant low - energy degrees of freedom on an external electro - magnetic field .",
    "only two linear combinations are constrained from experiments  @xcite , and only at zero photon energy , namely the forward and backward spin - polarisabilities @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the nucleon which however involve all four static ( dipole ) spin - polarisabilities .",
    "as quadrupole and higher polarisabilities are negligible , one can use the multipole - expansion of the scattering amplitudes in ( [ eq : strucamp ] ) to perform with increasing sophistication fits of the six dipole polarisabilities per nucleon to data - sets which combine polarised and spin - averaged experiments , taken at fixed energy but varying scattering angle .",
    "one can for example assume that the energy - dependence of the polarisabilities derived in @xmath39eft is correct : at low energies , only @xmath15 and pion degrees of freedom are expected to give dispersive contributions to the polarisabilities . as starting values for the fit , one might thus use the @xmath39eft - results  @xcite , with deviations taken as energy - independent , corresponding to a free normalisation for each dipole polarisability .",
    "thus , one obtains the dipole polarisabilities at a definite energy .",
    "repeating this procedure for various energies gives their energy dependence  @xcite .",
    "this is one way to extract dynamical polarisabilities directly from the angular dependence of observables .    as fig .",
    "3 shows , the results for the spin - independent polarisabilities @xmath9 , @xmath10 from @xmath39eft and dispersion theory agree very well with each other , both in their energy - dependence and overall size .",
    "they could therefore be used in a second step as input to reduce the number of fit functions in ( [ eq : strucamp ] ) to four , namely the four dipole spin - polarisabilities .",
    "the good agreement in @xmath11 and maybe even @xmath12 can  similarly  be used to reduce the number of fit functions further to three or two per nucleon : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "+    an analysis of compton scattering via a multipole decomposition at fixed energies can thus substantially further our knowledge on the spin - structure of the proton .",
    "it will also provide better data on the neutron polarisabilities , which are known much less accurately than the proton ones .",
    "double - polarised , high - accuracy experiments provide thus a new avenue to extract the energy - dependence of the six polarisabilities per nucleon , both spin - independent  @xcite and spin - dependent  @xcite",
    ". a ( certainly incomplete ) list of planned or approved experiments at photon energies below @xmath49 shows the concerted effort in this field : polarised photons on polarised deuterons and @xmath59he at tunl / hi@xmath60s ; tagged protons at s - dalinac ; polarised photons on polarised protons at mami ; and deuteron targets at maxlab .",
    "for example , the asymmetry @xmath61 between the neutron - spin in positive or negative @xmath62-direction in compton scattering of a circularly polarised photon with momentum in the @xmath63-direction shows strong sensitivity on the spin - polarisabilities @xmath64 and on @xmath38-physics , while higher polarisabilities are negligible ; see fig .  4 and  @xcite .",
    "similar findings hold for other asymmetries .",
    "dynamical polarisabilities are a concept complementary to _ generalised _ polarisabilities of the nucleon , and more directly accessible .",
    "the latter probe the nucleon in virtual compton scattering , i.e.  with an incoming photon of non - zero virtuality , and provide information about the spatial distribution of charges and magnetism inside the nucleon . _ dynamical polarisabilities _ on the other hand test the global response of the internal nucleonic degrees of freedom to a _ real _ photon of _ non - zero _ energy and answer the question , _ which _ internal degrees of freedom govern the structure of the nucleon at low energies .",
    "they do not contain more or less information than the corresponding compton scattering amplitudes , but the facts are more readily accessible and easier to interpret .",
    "enlightening insight into the electro - magnetic structure of the nucleon has already been gained from them , and a host of experimental activities is going to add to them in the next years .",
