    "magnetoelectric effect , which is a consequence of the interplay between electric and magnetic properties of electrons first proposed by curie  @xcite , has long been studied extensively in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "it is an intriguing phenomenon where the magnetization is induced by an electric field and the electric polarization is induced by a magnetic field .",
    "recently , it has attracted renewed interest since the discovery of multiferroic materials showing large magnetoelectric responses  @xcite . in these magnetic insulators , both spatial - inversion and time - reversal symmetries are broken by a spontaneous magnetic order , yielding simultaneously a uniform electric polarization and a magnetization  @xcite .",
    "such multiferroic materials have been intensively studied not only from the viewpoint of fundamental physics but also for potential applications to multifunctional devices  @xcite .",
    "a toroidal order is one of the states of matter showing such cross - correlations between electric and magnetic responses . a toroidal moment , which is represented by a vector product of electric and magnetic moments ,",
    "was originally introduced as an anapole moment in the context of parity violation by weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "recently , a toroidal order , a periodic array of toroidal moments in crystals , has gained interest because it leads to exotic phenomena , such as a diamagnetic anomaly and nonreciprocal directional dichroism  @xcite , in addition to ordinary magnetoelectric effects .",
    "there are several multiferroic materials which exhibit toroidal orders .",
    "for instance , cr@xmath0o@xmath1 shows a toroidal order in the spin - flop phase under strong magnetic field  @xcite . in the magnetic piezoelectric material gafeo@xmath1 ,",
    "a ferroic toroidal order was detected by resonant magnetoelectric x - ray scattering  @xcite .",
    "licopo@xmath2 exhibits a large linear magnetoelectric effect , and the coexistence of ferrotoroidic and antiferromagnetic domains was observed by optical second harmonic generation  @xcite .",
    "ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath3 gives rise to a spontaneous toroidal order due to single - ion effects  @xcite .",
    "these findings are thus far restricted to insulators .",
    "toroidal orders can exist also in metallic systems despite the absence of a macroscopic polarization .",
    "their influences on electronic and magnetoelectric properties can be more interesting than in insulators owing to the conducting nature .",
    "for instance , recently , an antiferromagnetic metal on a zigzag lattice , which accommodates a toroidal order , was shown to exhibit an interesting magnetoelectric response  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , toroidal orders in metals have not been studied intensively , in particular , from the microscopic point of view . for further stimulating experiments on toroidal ordered systems , it is desired to systematically study how toroidal orders affect the electronic structure , transport properties , and magnetoelectric effects .",
    "it is also important to examine the stability of toroidal orders and to clarify the finite - temperature behavior associated with spontaneous toroidal ordering .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate a microscopic model in order to clarify the effect of toroidal ordering in metals .",
    "in particular , we examine the effect of spontaneous ferroic ordering of toroidal moments with a focus on the lattice structures on which the spatial - inversion symmetry is preserved globally but broken intrinsically at each magnetic site .",
    "we consider a low - energy effective single - band model for a minimal four - band tight - binding model .",
    "the site - dependent antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling in the effective model is derived from the atomic spin - orbit coupling , off - site hybridization between orbitals with different parities , and odd - parity crystalline electric field together with electron - electron interactions . as a typical example",
    ", we study the effect of a toroidal order triggered by a vortex - like magnetic order in the effective model on a layered honeycomb lattice .",
    "the ferroic ordering of microscopic toroidal moments acts as an effective gauge field , which leads to modulations of the band dispersions with a shift of the band bottom from the @xmath4 point .",
    "we find that the toroidal magnetic order plays an important role in the anisotropic magnetotransport and the magnetoelectric effects depending on the direction of the applied electric current .",
    "in particular , we elucidate that an out - of - plane electric current induces a vortex - like magnetic order , while an in - plane current yields a transverse uniform magnetization in the plane by canting the underlying vortex - like magnetic order .",
    "we discuss such effects from a symmetry point of view . we also provide some implications to experiments for toroidal metals .",
    "although the qualitatively similar results were obtained for a related model in the previous study  @xcite , the present work provides a comprehensive analysis focusing on the toroidal ordering .",
    "moreover , investigating the model by a mean - field approximation , we find that such a ferroic toroidal order appears at low temperatures in a wide range of strongly - correlated regions for low electron density .",
    "we also show that temperature dependence of the anomalous magnetoelectric responses .",
    "we find that the longitudinal toroidal response to the current exhibits a broad peak around the critical temperature with a kink at the transition , while the transverse uniform magnetization induced by the current shows order - parameter like behavior .",

    ", we give a brief summary for making the present paper self - contained and for understanding the microscopic results in the following sections .",
    "first , we discuss a microscopic origin of the toroidal moment .",
    "in general , magnetic and toroidal multipoles appear in the multipole expansion of an electromagnetic vector potential , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is vector spherical harmonics  @xcite ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the azimuthal and magnetic quantum numbers , respectively , and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath6 has parity @xmath10 under spatial inversion . since @xmath11 is a polar vector with time - reversal odd , @xmath12 in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_expansion ] ) represents the magnetic multipoles ( axial tensor ) and @xmath13 in the second term the toroidal multipoles ( polar tensor ) .",
    "thus , the even - rank tensor @xmath12 and the odd - rank tensor @xmath13 become active only when both spatial - inversion and time - reversal symmetries are broken .",
    "the toroidal moment @xmath14 appears in the lowest - rank ( @xmath15 ) contribution in the latter term  @xcite , which is written in the form @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the position vector and the classical circular electric current at @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "when there is an internal magnetic field by spins instead of the electric current , the toroidal moment is expressed in terms of the localized spin @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the land @xmath22-factor and @xmath23 is the bohr magneton .",
    "this definition indicates that the toroidal moment is represented by the sum of vector products of the position vector and localized spin , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toroidal_structure ] .",
    "we note that there is an ambiguity in the definitions in eqs .",

    "the repeated greek indices are implicitly summed over hereafter .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : h_int ] ) indicates that the toroidal moment @xmath14 couples to the curl of magnetic field , that is , the electric current .",
    "next , we describe macroscopic responses of the toroidal moment to electromagnetic fields  @xcite .",

    "@xmath36 in the last term is related to linear magnetoelectric responses , and it is nonzero only when both global spatial - inversion and time - reversal symmetries are broken .",
    "this magnetoelectric contribution can be divided into three terms : @xmath37 where coefficients of the first , second , and third terms represent magnetic flux ( pseudoscalar ) , toroidal magnetization @xmath38 ( polar vector ) , and magnetic quadrupole ( symmetric traceless pseudotensor ) .",
    "thus , the antisymmetric components of magnetoelectric tensor @xmath36 correspond to the toroidal magnetization , which is defined as the toroidal moment per unit volume .",
    "the linear magnetoelectric effect by toroidal ordering is understood from eq .",
    "( [ eq : me free energy ] )  @xcite .",
    "namely , the second term implies the relations @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the electric polarization and magnetization , respectively .",
