    "strict @xmath1-categories have an easy inductive definition , with a strict @xmath2-category being a category enriched in the category of strict @xmath1-categories via its _ cartesian _ product , but unfortunately these structures are too strict for intended applications in homotopy theory and geometry . in dimension 2 as is well - known , there is no real problem because any bicategory is biequivalent to a strict 2-category .",
    "however in dimension 3 the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak @xmath3-category with  and not lose vital information  is a gray category , which is a category enriched in @xmath4 using the gray tensor product of 2-categories instead of its cartesian product @xcite .",
    "this leads naturally to the idea of trying to define what the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product are , in order to set up a similar inductive definition as for strict @xmath1-categories , but to capture the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak @xmath1-category with and _ not _ lose vital information .    ignoring the 2-cells in the definition of the gray tensor product one",
    "has a canonical tensor product of categories , which has been called the _ funny tensor product_. it is different from the cartesian product of categories . in this article",
    "we explain that for _ any _ higher categorical structure definable by an @xmath1-operad @xmath5 in the sense of @xcite , one has an analogous tensor product giving the category of @xmath5-algebras a symmetric monoidal closed structure .",
    "we call these generalisations of the funny tensor product `` free products '' for reasons that will become clear .    in @xcite",
    "the foundations of higher category theory in the globular style were given a major overhaul .",
    "the resulting theory is expressed as the interplay between lax monoidal structures on a category @xmath6 and monads on the category @xmath7 of graphs enriched in @xmath6 .",
    "this perspective enables one to understand many issues in higher category theory without looking at the combinatorics that might , at first glance , appear to make things difficult .",
    "our description and analysis of the generalisations of the funny tensor product is an illustration of this .",
    "thus the present paper is written within the framework of established by @xcite , and so we shall use the terminology and notations of that paper here without further comment .",
    "we recall the funny tensor product of categories in section([sec : funny ] ) , focussing in particular on those aspects which we have been able to generalise to all higher categorical structures in place of @xmath8 .",
    "then in section([sec : monoidal - monads ] ) we review the theory of symmetric monoidal monads from the point of view of multicategories .",
    "none of this section is new .",
    "the theory of symmetric monoidal monads is originally due to anders kock @xcite @xcite @xcite , and in the setting of lawvere theories to fred linton @xcite .",
    "however , our use of multicategorical notions , especially representablility in the sense of hermida @xcite and closedness in the sense of manzyuk @xcite , to help understand monoidal monads does appear to be original .",
    "it is this synthesis of the theories of symmetric monoidal monads and of multicategories that provides the most convenient framework within which to construct tensor products from monads and operads .    a notion of multimap of enriched graph",
    "is provided by a general construction in section([ssec : obj - f ] ) which applies to any category equipped with a functor into @xmath9 .",
    "the 2-functoriality of this construction described in section([ssec:2functoriality - f ] ) and its compatibility with monad theory described in section([ssec : monads - from - f ] ) , enables one to give any monad defined on @xmath7 over @xmath9 a canonical symmetric monoidal structure . applying then our formulation of the theory of symmetric monoidal monads , we are able to exhibit our higher dimensional analogues of the funny tensor product in section([ssec : fp - monad - algebras ] ) .",
    "some of the formal properties that they enjoy are exhibited in sections([ssec : free - vs - cartesian ] ) and ( [ ssec : pushout - formula ] ) .",
    "in particular in section([ssec : free - vs - cartesian ] ) we isolate a condition on a monad so that one obtains a canonical identity on objects comparison between the free product of @xmath10-algebras and its cartesian product .",
    "this important because , as explained to the author by john bourke , the gray tensor product for 2-categories may be obtained by factorising this map , in the case where @xmath10 is the monad on @xmath11 for 2-categories , using the bijective on objects fully faithful factorisation for @xmath8 on the homs . in this way",
    "the coherence data for the gray tensor product is determined by what we know more generally from our theoretical framework and the magic of orthogonal factorisation systems .",
    "for this reason it seems that a complete understanding of the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product is within reach .",
    "given an @xmath1-operad @xmath5 one may consider categories enriched in the algebras of @xmath5 for the free product .",
    "we call such structures _ sesqui-@xmath5-algebras_. in section([ssec : monads - sesqui - algebras ] ) we give an explicit description of the monad whose algebras are sesqui-@xmath5-algebras .",
    "this depends on a general result , called the `` multitensor dropping theorem '' , given in section([ssec : dropping - theorem ] ) . then in section([ssec : operads - sesqui - algebras ] ) we explain why this monad is part of an @xmath2-operad .",
    "these results will form part of the inductive machine for semi - strict @xmath1-categories that we hope to uncover in future work .",
    "the category @xmath8 is a cartesian closed category . by    _",
    "_ foltz , kelly and lair__@xcite up to isomorphism there are exactly two biclosed monoidal structures on @xmath8 , and both are symmetric .",
    "@xmath8 has another symmetric monoidal closed structure .",
    "the corresponding tensor product has been called the _ funny tensor product_. it is related to the cartesian product by identity - on - objects functors @xmath12 which are natural in @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus the objects of @xmath14 are pairs @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . a generators and relations description of the morphisms of @xmath14 is as follows .",
    "they are generated by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are in @xmath5 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are in @xmath13 .",
    "the relations are obtained by remembering composition in @xmath5 and @xmath13 , that is @xmath23 so given maps @xmath24 and @xmath25 one has the square @xmath26 { ( a_1,b_2)}=\"tr \" [ d ] { ( a_2,b_2)}=\"br \" [ l ] { ( a_2,b_1)}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\"^-{(a_1,\\beta)}:\"br\"^{(\\alpha , b_2)},:\"bl\"_{(\\alpha , b_1)}:\"br\"_-{(a_2,\\beta)})}\\ ] ] which by contrast with the cartesian product does not commute in general . in other words",
    "this square in @xmath14 has not one but _ two diagonals _ , the composites @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are identified by the functor @xmath29 .",
    "an explicit description of the gray tensor product of @xmath0-categories proceeds in the same way as for @xmath30 on objects and arrows , with the key feature in dimension 2 being an isomorphism between these two diagonals .    while @xmath30 acts on objects like cartesian product , on morphisms it behaves more like a _ _ co__product . in particular taking @xmath5 and @xmath13 to be monoids , that is to say one object categories , then @xmath14 is of course also a monoid , and is in fact the coproduct , in the category of monoids , of @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is standard terminology from algebra to refer to the coproduct in the category of monoids as the _ free product _ of monoids , and so after this section we shall adopt this terminology , referring to @xmath30 and its generalisations as `` free products '' .    for general categories this coproduct - like behaviour for the arrows of @xmath14",
    "is expressed by the pushout @xmath31 { a_0{\\times}b}=\"tr \" [ d ] { a{\\tensor}b}=\"br \" [ l ] { a{\\times}b_0}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\"^-{\\id{\\times}i_b}:@{.>}\"br\",:\"bl\"_{i_a{\\times}\\id}:@{.>}\"br \" ) \" br \" [ u(.3)l(.3 ) ] ( : @{-}[r(.15)],:@{-}[d(.15)])}\\ ] ] in @xmath8 in which @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) denote the underlying discrete category of @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) , and @xmath34 ( resp .",
    "@xmath35 ) are the inclusions",
    ". we shall call this the _ pushout formula _ for the funny tensor product @xmath14 .",
    "the internal hom @xmath36 $ ] of @xmath5 and @xmath13 corresponding to the funny tensor product , has functors @xmath37 as objects just as in the cartesian case , but mere _ transformations _ as morphisms .",
    "a transformation @xmath38 between functors @xmath37 consists of a morphism @xmath39 for each @xmath16 .",
    "these components @xmath40 are not required to satisfy the usual naturality condition as in the cartesian case .",
    "in this section we will describe what for us is the `` abstract categorical theory of tensor products which arise from universal properties '' . throughout this section the reader",
    "is invited to keep in mind the basic guiding example of the symmetric monoidal closed structure on the category @xmath41 of modules over a commutative ring @xmath42 .",
    "it was claudio hermida who expressed in @xcite how one may regard this monoidal structure as arising from the _ multicategory _ of @xmath42-modules and @xmath42-multilinear maps between them .",
    "so for hermida this multicategory is the more fundamental object , with the monoidal structure on @xmath41 just an expression of its _ representability _ in his sense .",
    "this notion captures abstractly the idea that the tensor product of @xmath42-modules , by definition , classifies @xmath42-multilinearity .",
    "a different perspective comes from the theory of symmetric monoidal monads of anders kock @xcite @xcite @xcite . by definition",
    "a symmetric monoidal monad is a monad in the 2-category @xmath43 of symmetric monoidal categories , lax symmetric monoidal functors and monoidal natural transformations .",
    "thus the data of a symmetric monoidal monad is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a symmetric monoidal category , @xmath46 is a lax symmetric monoidal functor , the components of @xmath47 look like @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the unit and multiplication of the monad and are monoidal transformations . the precise example which relates to",
    "the present discussion is    [ ex : kockmnd ] regard a commutative ring @xmath42 as a monad on @xmath9 , where for @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the set of formal @xmath42-linear combinations of elements of @xmath53 .",
    "the unit is given by @xmath54 , and the multiplication of the monad is given by the evident substitution of formal linear combinations .",
    "an algebra of @xmath42 is simply an @xmath42-module .",
    "given a finite sequence of sets @xmath55 one has a function @xmath56 defined by @xmath57 which provides the monoidal functor coherences .    for kock the above monad @xmath42 is the fundamental combinatorial object from which the symmetric monoidal closed structure of @xmath41 may be obtained .    in this section",
    "we review the theory of symmetric monoidal monads from the point of view of multicategories . given a symmetric monoidal monad @xmath58 , we will first see that @xmath59 underlies a symmetric multicategory . then under some hypotheses",
    "this multicategory will be seen to be closed in the sense of @xcite .",
    "closed multicategories are more easily exhibited as representable , as observed in section([ssec : multicat - review ] ) , and we use this to recover the tensor product on @xmath59 by exhibiting the corresponding multicategory of algebras as representable .",
    "so for us the main results of symmetric monoidal monad theory are expressed as the closedness and representablilty of the symmetric multicategory of algebras of the original symmetric monoidal monad .",
    "thus in our treatment , both kock s and hermida s perspectives on `` how the symmetric monoidal closed structure of @xmath41 arises '' are placed on an equal footing .",
    "depending on what is most convenient in a given situation @xmath60 are different notations we shall use for the same thing , namely a sequence of sets @xmath61 .",
    "similarly a typical element @xmath62 of the cartesian product of these sets has the alternative notations @xmath63 for example , we may speak of multimaps @xmath64 in a given multicategory @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a _ sequence _ of objects and @xmath67 is a single object from @xmath65 , and the set of such may be denoted as @xmath68 .",
    "when the sequence @xmath66 has length @xmath69 , we say that the multimap @xmath70 is _ linear _ , and we denote by @xmath71 the category of objects and linear maps in @xmath65 , this being the object part of a 2-functor @xmath72 out of the 2-category of @xmath73 of symmetric multicategories .",
    "we denote elements of sequences of sequences of sets in a similar manner consistent with our tensor product notation . for example",
    "given multimaps @xmath74 in a multicategory , one usually denotes their composite as @xmath75 but we shall sometimes use the notation @xmath76 for the same thing . by way of illustration",
    "let us recall the definition of the objects , arrows and 2-cells of the 2-category @xmath73 .",

    ".   @xmath138 for some symmetric monoidal category @xmath6 iff @xmath53 is representable in the sense of hermida @xcite.[u - rep ] 2 .",
    "@xmath137 is 2-fully - faithful.[u-2ff ]    this result is a mild reformulation of some aspects of the theory of multicategories already in the literature , especially in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall some of this theory , and in so doing , explain why this result is true .",
    "let @xmath53 be a multicategory .",
    "a multimap @xmath64 in @xmath53 is _ universal _ when for all @xmath139 the function @xmath140 given by composition with @xmath70 is a bijection . in other words",
    "any multimap out of @xmath66 may be identified with a unique linear map out of @xmath67 .",
    "the example to keep in mind is the multicategory of vector spaces and multilinear maps . in this case",
    "the universality of @xmath70 expresses that the vector space @xmath67 is exactly the tensor product of the @xmath141 .",
    "thus one might be tempted to guess that a monoidal category is really just a multicategory in which every tuple of objects admits such a universal multimap . while this is a good first guess , it is not quite correct in general , and it was hermida who understood in @xcite how to express this idea correctly .",
    "hermida s key insight is that one must strengthen the notion of universal map . in order to express this idea",
    "it is necessary to recall placed composition in a multicategory . given a multimap @xmath142 and @xmath143 for some @xmath123",
    ", one defines their _ placed composite _ @xmath144 as the composite @xmath145 in @xmath53 .",
    "clearly one can recapture general composition from placed composition .",
    "a multimap @xmath64 in @xmath53 is _ strongly universal _",
    "when for all sequences @xmath146 and @xmath123 such that @xmath147 , and objects @xmath121 of @xmath53 , the function @xmath148 given by placed composition with @xmath70 is a bijection .",
    "the multicategory @xmath53 is _ representable _ when for every tuple of objects @xmath119 of @xmath53 , there exists a strongly universal multimap out of it . in order to bring out the relation with monoidal categories",
    "one may denote a choice of such a strongly universal multimap as @xmath149 to emphasize that from such a choice one obtains a monoidal structure on the category of objects and linear maps of @xmath53 , and the non - symmetric analogue of @xmath137 sends this monoidal category to @xmath53 .",
    "it is not very hard to adapt these insights to the symmetric case .",
    "a symmetric multicategory is representable when it is representable as a mere multicategory , and when @xmath53 is a representable symmetric multicategory with a given choice of universal maps , the symmetries on @xmath53 give rise in the evident way to symmetries for the induced tensor product on the linear part of @xmath53 .",
    "as for the 2-fully - faithfulness , hermida showed that monoidal categories are the adjoint pseudo - algebras of a lax idempotent 2-monad on the 2-category of multicategories .",
    "this too is easily adapted to the symmetric case , and so one may regard @xmath137 as the forgetful 2-functor from the 2-category of adjoint pseudo - algebras , lax maps and algebra 2-cells , for a lax idempotent 2-monad on @xmath73 . by the general theory of such 2-monads ,",
    "see for instance @xcite , such forgetful 2-functors are always 2-fully - faithful .",

    "recall that the functor @xmath607 which sends a @xmath6-graph to its set of objects has a representing object @xmath436 , and so we have an adjunction @xmath608 { \\set}=\"r \" \" l\":@<-1ex>\"r\"_-{(-)_0}|-{}=\"b\":@<-1ex>\"l\"_-{(-){\\cdot}0}|-{}=\"t \" \" t\":@{}\"b\"|{\\perp}}\\ ] ] and we regard the @xmath6-graph @xmath609 as having object set @xmath65 and all homs equal to @xmath433 the initial object of @xmath6 . for convenience we write the functor @xmath610 as though it were an inclusion .",
    "the counit of this adjunction has components we will denote as @xmath611 , and these are the identity on objects , and the hom maps are determined uniquely .",
    "obviously @xmath612 is cartesian natural in @xmath53 : to see this it suffices by @xcite lemma(5.17 ) to look at all the induced squares between homs of a given naturality square since @xmath612 is the identity on objects , and these are all of the form @xmath613 { a}=\"tr \" [ d ] { b}=\"br \" [ l ] { \\emptyset}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"bl\":\"br\",:\"tr\":\"br\")}\\ ] ] which since @xmath433 is a strict initial object by the extensivity of @xmath6 , are automatically pullbacks .    the extensivity of @xmath6 enables a more efficient description of the free product on @xmath7 .",
    "recall that the general definition of the homs of @xmath614 required a case split  see the formula([gv - tensor ] ) of section([ssec : fp - gv ] ) .",
    "let us consider the functor @xmath615 which sends a set @xmath65 to the @xmath6-graph with object set @xmath65 and homs defined by @xmath616 if @xmath617 and @xmath618 if @xmath619 .",
    "clearly @xmath620 may be identified with taking copowers with @xmath69 , that is @xmath621 . for convenience we shall also denote by @xmath620 the endofunctor @xmath622 of @xmath7 , in other words for @xmath623 we write @xmath624 for @xmath625 . since the cartesian product of @xmath6 is distributive , the formula([gv - tensor ] ) of section([ssec : fp - gv ] ) may be re - expressed as in    let @xmath6 have products and coproducts , with coproducts distributing over finite products .",
    "then the homs of the free product on @xmath7 may be re - expressed as @xmath626    if @xmath627 then the homs @xmath628 are all @xmath69 making the right hand side the coproduct of the @xmath629 .",
    "if all but one , say the @xmath196-th , coordinates of @xmath19 and @xmath21 coincide , then the only non-@xmath433 summand on the right hand side of ( [ gv - tensor2 ] ) is @xmath629 .",
    "otherwise all summands are @xmath433 .",
    "thus ( [ gv - tensor2 ] ) coincides with formula([gv - tensor ] ) of section([ssec : fp - gv ] ) under the given hypotheses .    assuming that @xmath10 is well - pointed and preserves coproducts we have @xmath630 and so @xmath624 is in fact a free @xmath10-algebra . for convenience",
    "we write @xmath631 .",
    "note that we have maps @xmath632 which given the extensivity of @xmath6 and lraness of @xmath10 , are cartesian - natural in @xmath53 .",
    "thus we can define maps @xmath633 as follows .",
    "they are identities on objects . to define the hom maps it suffices in view of ( [ gv - tensor2 ] ) to define the maps @xmath634 where @xmath635 denotes the @xmath196-th coproduct inclusion , and we define @xmath636 and by this definition @xmath637 is clearly natural in its arguments .",
    "in fact    [ lem : kappa - bar ] let @xmath6 be complete and extensive , and suppose that the monad @xmath10 on @xmath7 over @xmath9 is well - pointed , cartesian and preserves coproducts",
    ". then @xmath638 is cartesian natural in the @xmath596 .    by extensivity it suffices to show",
    "that the @xmath639 are cartesian natural , and this follows since @xmath612 and @xmath640 are cartesian , and products of pullback squares are pullbacks .    to conclude the proof of lemma([lem : key ] ) it remains to show that @xmath641 .",
    "the problem with doing this at the generality of lemma([lem : kappa - bar ] ) is that @xmath637 and @xmath603 implicitly involve the two different ways of describing multimaps of @xmath6-graphs  the general one from @xmath316 involving object maps and linear parts , versus the description of example([ex : fgv ] ) involving object maps and individual hom maps . without the more explicit description of @xmath10 that becomes available",
    "since it is distributive and path - like , it does nt seem possible to identify @xmath637 and @xmath603 .",
    "so we now use that @xmath10 is distributive and path - like so that there exists a distributive multitensor @xmath456 on @xmath6 and @xmath642 by proposition(4.11 ) .",
    "this means that for all @xmath623 and @xmath551 we have maps @xmath643 for all sequences @xmath119 starting at @xmath19 and finishing at @xmath21 , and taken together these form a coproduct cocone .",
    "thus given a multimap @xmath644 of @xmath6-graphs , the multimap @xmath645 may be described explicitly as having object map that of @xmath70 , and hom map corresponding to @xmath646 and @xmath647 , defined by the commutativity of @xmath648 { tx_{i^*}(a , b)}=\"tr \" [ d ] { ty(f(x|_{i^*}a),f(x|_{i^*}b))}=\"br \" [ l ] { \\ope\\limits_jy(f(x|_{i^*}z_{j{-}1}),f(x|_{i^*}z_j))}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\"^-{c_{(z_j)_j}}:\"br\"^-{(tf)_{x , a , b}},:@<1ex>\"bl\"_-{\\ope\\limits_jf_{x , z_{j{-}1},z_j}}:\"br\"_-{c_{(f(x|_{i^*}z_j))_j}})}\\ ] ] for all sequences @xmath649 in @xmath650 from @xmath19 to @xmath21 . so using this extra explicit information we finish the proof of lemma([lem : key ] ) in    [ lem : last ] let @xmath6 and @xmath10 satisfy the hypotheses of lemma([lem : key ] ) .",
    "then @xmath651 .",
    "given @xmath6-graphs @xmath61 and @xmath467 we must show @xmath652 , where @xmath468 is the @xmath196-th projection of the product .",
    "we will show that the corresponding multimaps @xmath653 in @xmath316 are the same . to this end",
    "consider @xmath654 { ( tx_i)_i}=\"tm \" [ r ] { ( t0|_jtx_j)_i}=\"tr \" [ d ] { tx_j}=\"br \" [ l ] { t\\freeprod\\limits_ix_i}=\"bm \" [ l ] { \\freeprod\\limits_ix_i}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tm\"^-{(\\eta_{x_i})_i}(:\"tr\"^-{(t_{tx_i}|_j\\id)_i}:\"br\"^{t(\\alpha_{(0|_{j}x_j)_i})},:\"bm\"^{t\\alpha_{(x_i)_i}}),:\"bl\"_{\\alpha_{(x_i)_i}}:@<1ex>\"bm\"_-{\\eta}:@<1ex>\"br\"_-{p_j\\kappa_{(x_i)_i}})}\\ ] ] in which the linear maps are the unique maps in view of @xmath655 by well - pointedness , and the @xmath24 maps are the universal maps described just before proposition([prop : fgv - rep ] ) .",
    "note that the right hand square may be regarded as living in @xmath389 and it commutes by the definition of @xmath471 .",
    "the left hand square commutes by the multinaturality of @xmath49 . by the explicit description of the hom maps of @xmath656 in terms of the corresponding multitensor @xmath456 ( see the discussion just before the statement of this lemma ) , the top composite of the diagram @xmath657 is the multimap corresponding to @xmath658 , and so the outside of the diagram witnesses @xmath652 at the level of multimaps .",
