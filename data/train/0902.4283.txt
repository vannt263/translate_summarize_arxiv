    "the energy density during inflation is dominated by the inflaton potential energy . at the end of inflation , the energy stored in the inflaton potential",
    "is converted into particles , which decay and reheat the universe by thermalization to start the standard hot big bang phase .",
    "in this paper we consider phase transition from a phase @xmath0 to another phase @xmath1 , which are distinguished by the scaling of the energy density of a component @xmath2 .",
    "namely , we consider a scaling of the energy density @xmath3 in phase @xmath0 and @xmath4 in phase @xmath1 , where @xmath5 causes generation of the density perturbations when the phase transition is inhomogeneous in space .",
    "the mechanism is very general and can be applied to many other models in which the transition between phases of different scaling is inhomogeneous in space , even if the transition is not a `` phases transition '' in the strict meaning .    before discussing inhomogeneous phase transition ,",
    "we review the mechanism of inhomogeneous reheating @xcite to illustrate the basis of inhomogeneous scenarios . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it has been argued that in realistic models of inflation the coupling of the inflaton to matter can be determined by the vacuum expectation values of fields in the underlying theory .",
    "if those fields ( in the string theory they would be moduli fields from the compactified space ) are light during inflation , they will fluctuate leading to density perturbations through the inhomogeneities of the coupling constants .",
    "if the density perturbations created during inflation are negligible and the universe after inflation is filled with particles @xmath6 of mass @xmath7 and decay rate @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter during inflation , spatial inhomogeneities in @xmath10 may lead to density perturbations when the particles decay into radiation . in deriving the magnitude of the density perturbations arising from the inhomogeneity ,",
    "it is useful to compare the energy density in a region to the virtual hidden radiation @xmath11 , which scales as @xmath12 and calculate the density perturbations on a uniform @xmath13 surface . here",
    ", we assume that there is no energy transition between the radiation density @xmath13 and other components of the universe . assuming that the domination by @xmath6 particles starts at @xmath14 when @xmath15 , particles is a constant . unlike the original argument in ref.@xcite , we consider a uniform @xmath16 and @xmath17 to simplify the argument . ]",
    "the energy of the @xmath6 particles scales as matter in the domination interval @xmath18 : @xmath19 with decay time @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 outside the domination interval , we assume that the energy density scales as radiation .",
    "fig.([fig : mass - dom ] ) shows a schematic representation of the inhomogeneous boundary that creates density fluctuations .",
    "( 440,250)(0,0 )    [ fig : mass - dom ]    note that in this model the delay of the @xmath6-decay causes a delay in the evolution of the energy density .",
    "the calculation of the density perturbation is straightforward . considering the @xmath6 domination interval",
    ", we find @xmath22 where @xmath16 and @xmath23 are uniform in space , while @xmath10 is inhomogeneous .",
    "using @xmath13 in eq.([rad - rho ] ) , we can find the energy density after the decay : @xmath24 where the ratio @xmath25 is a time - independent constant after the decay .",
    "the density perturbation on a uniform @xmath13 surface is thus given by @xmath26 which reproduces the limit @xmath27 in ref.@xcite .",
    "another way to generate cosmological perturbations from an inhomogeneous boundary is to consider an inhomogeneous end for the inflationary phase @xcite . for inflationary expansion ,",
    "the equation for the number of e - foldings is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the time when the long - wavelength inhomogeneity exits the horizon and @xmath30 is the time when inflation ends .",
    "we define @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the inflaton field @xmath33 . using @xmath13 and repeating the calculation given above , in place of eq .",

    "therefore , the density perturbation on a uniform @xmath13 surface , which is caused by the inhomogeneities in @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 and recovers the conventional delta - n formula @xmath38 . and",
    "the @xmath39 formula that relates @xmath40 to @xmath41 . ]",
    "more specifically , we can calculate @xmath41 from the @xmath42 inhomogeneity in the inflationary scenario using a very simple equation @xmath43 . in most inflationary scenarios ,",
    "@xmath36 is given explicitly by @xmath44 and @xmath42 .",
    "considering the two scenarios discussed above , the curvature perturbations created by the inhomogeneous boundaries are natural consequences of the inhomogeneities arising from long - wavelength fluctuations of light fields . in this paper , we consider inhomogeneous phase transitions in which the critical temperature is not homogeneous in space .",
    "if the potential energy dominates during a short interval , the phase may be dubbed mini - inflation . following the uniform @xmath45 calculation discussed above",
    ", we can calculate the density perturbations created at the phase boundary . to calculate the density perturbations we assume ( 1 ) the beginning of the phase occurs simultaneously in space , but the end is inhomogeneous , ( 2 ) the transition occurs instantly just after the interval and ( 3 )",
    "all the energy stored in the potential is translated into radiation .",
    "complementary scenarios for more generic situations require numerical study and are highly model - dependent , thus they will be considered in future works",
    ". however , we consider a particularly attractive model , featuring the possibility of inhomogeneous phase transitions at the electroweak ( or more generically , unification ) scale that may lead to the creation of a significant level of non - gaussianity .",
    "to illustrate some typical features of finite temperature effects , we consider a real scalar field and a potential : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is tuned so that the cosmological constant vanishes at the true minimum .",
    "the phenomenon of high - temperature symmetry restoration can be understood by the finite - temperature effective potential given by @xcite @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the one - loop potential for zero - temperature with the classical field @xmath50 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a renormalization mass scale . at high temperatures",
    ", @xmath53 can be expanded as @xmath54 which suggests that the temperature - corrected effective mass at @xmath55 changes sign at a critical temperature @xmath56 in a more general situation , one may introduce couplings to the fields in the background thermal bath .",
    "if the couplings of @xmath33 to the fields in the background thermal bath are more significant than the self - coupling , a typical form of the potential with a thermal correction term is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the effective coupling of @xmath33 to the fields in the thermal bath .",
    "in this case , the critical temperature is given by @xmath59 in this section , we consider the latter case where @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 .",
    "the phase transition is second order in the model discussed above .",
    "we consider two distinct cases :    1 .",
    "the energy density of the universe is dominated by the potential energy @xmath47 during the interval @xmath62 .",
    "the universe is then dominated by radiation , due to instant decay .",
    "we assume that all the energy stored in the potential is converted into radiation just after the phase transition ( i.e. , we assume @xmath63 .",
    "see also fig.[fig : case1 ] ) .",
    "the energy density of the universe is still dominated by radiation at @xmath64 .",
    "after the phase transition at @xmath64 , all the potential energy is converted into non - relativistic particles @xmath6 that scale as matter .",
    "the interval of the radiation domination may end at @xmath65 when @xmath66 , or more generically the @xmath6 particles may decay into radiation at @xmath67 before the domination . in this scenario , the inhomogeneous phase transition causes the inhomogeneities of the matter density .",
    "see also ref.@xcite in which the inhomogeneities of the curvatons are generated by inhomogeneous preheating .",
    "( 400,270)(0,0 )    in the former case , calculating the density perturbation is straightforward .",

    "considering @xmath69 as before , after the phase transition at @xmath70 we find that @xmath71 just after the phase transition , the potential energy is converted into radiation .",
    "the energy density perturbation on a uniform @xmath11 surface is thus given by @xmath72 where the curvature perturbation is given by @xmath73 this result can be obtained alternatively from the delta - n formula @xmath74 . for inflationary expansion during the @xmath47-dominated interval@xcite",
    ", the number of e - foldings is given by @xmath75 which leads to @xmath76 . in order to calculate the pure contribution from the inhomogeneous phase transition",
    ", we assume that all the energy stored in the potential is converted into radiation just after inflation . to understand the light - field potential",
    ", we consider a specific choice for the @xmath77-dependent mass : @xmath78 where @xmath77 is the light field and @xmath79 is the cut - off scale of the effective action .",
    "note that a conventional interaction @xmath80 in the effective low - energy action may induce the @xmath77-dependent mass . in this case",
    ", the thermal correction to the mass of the light field is @xmath81 , which is supposed to be smaller than the hubble parameter @xmath82 , as in the inhomogeneous reheating scenario discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "if there is no significant potential other than the finite - temperature effective potential @xmath83 , we find an effectively flat @xmath77 potential during the symmetry restoration phase .",
    "since the interaction depends on the values of the fields @xmath77 and @xmath33 , the background field trajectories after the phase transition may be sensitive to the initial conditions and the non - perturbative effects of the decay process , which means that the general evaluation of the cosmological parameters after the phase transition typically requires numerical calculations @xcite . however , the numerical study related to such a non - perturbative process after the phase transition is highly model - dependent and out of the scope of this paper .",
    "we thus assume that all the energy stored in the potential is instantly converted into radiation just after the phase transition , in order to single out the contribution from the inhomogeneous phase transition .",
    "in addition to the complexities of the decay process , the domain walls related to discrete symmetry breaking may cause a problem .",
    "however , cosmological domain walls can be made unstable and safe if a bias between the two vacua is induced by an effective interaction term that breaks the @xmath84 symmetry .",
    "note that for supergravity , domain walls caused by r - symmetry are safe since the supergravity interaction creates the required bias @xcite .",
    "therefore , for simplicity and to allow calculation of the model - independent contribution from the inhomogeneous phase transition , we ignore the domain wall problem in this paper , expecting that the walls decay instantly into radiation due to the bias between the two vacua .",
    "the latter scenario is less trivial .",
    "let us consider the case in which the energy density of the universe is dominated by radiation at @xmath64 and the non - relativistic @xmath6 particles decay into radiation at @xmath85 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : second - ex ] .",

    "the decay temperature @xmath90 is determined by @xmath91 where we assume @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the density perturbation is given by @xmath93 it is possible to consider a case in which the potential energy decays into radiation immediately after the phase transition ( i.e. , for @xmath94 and @xmath63 ) . in this case",
    ", we find @xmath95 which leads to the density perturbation given by @xmath96      in the simple second - order example , we consider effective couplings that depend on light fields .",
    "long - wavelength inhomogeneities of the light fields may lead to an inhomogeneous critical temperature @xmath97 . here , we consider another example , in which long - wavelength inhomogeneities of the number density of some particles cause an inhomogeneous end of the symmetry restoration phase .    during preheating ,",
    "some of the kinetic energy of the inflaton is converted into excitations of the preheat field @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath98 couples to a field @xmath99 with a potential @xmath100 where the inflaton terms are omitted , the effective potential caused by the high density of the preheat field is given by@xcite @xmath101 for @xmath102 , the effective potential gives @xmath103 when @xmath104 is very large , the field @xmath99 is trapped by a strong attraction from the origin . during the interval of the trapping , the potential barrier decreases , since @xmath104 scales as @xmath105 , and ultimately tunneling occurs below the critical number density @xcite given by @xmath106 if the energy density is dominated by the potential energy @xmath47 , the trapping leads to an inflationary expansion .",
    "the number of e - foldings elapsed during this interval is @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath30 are the time when the domination by the potential energy starts and when the inflationary expansion ends . in this model ,",
    "inhomogeneities in the initial number density @xmath109 can be created by inhomogeneous preheating@xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneities in the preheating arise from the long - wavelength fluctuations of the multi - field trajectory for the symmetry - breaking potential .",
    "this is the origin of @xmath41 discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition to the inhomogeneities in @xmath110 , we may consider inhomogeneities in @xmath111 , which are non - zero if @xmath112 and @xmath58 are modulated at the end of the trapping phase .",
    "using the delta - n formalism , for @xmath113 we find @xmath114      the main obstacle in building a model of an inhomogeneous electroweak phase transition is that the long - wavelength inhomogeneities of the light field must survive until the electroweak phase transition , when the hubble parameter is much lower than the gravitino mass . in supergravity models inspired by string theory , there are many light fields ( moduli ) in the effective action , but typically the mass of the moduli fields is expected to be of the same order as the gravitino mass , where the gravitino mass is generically given by @xmath115 , where @xmath116 tev is the supersymmetry breaking scale@xcite .",
    "the mass of the moduli @xmath117 is clearly larger than @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the critical temperature for the electroweak phase transition .",
    "therefore , if an inhomogeneous phase transition occurs at the electroweak phase transition , the inhomogeneities of the effective action must be inherited from the fluctuations of the light fields whose potential is protected by symmetry before the electroweak phase transition , while the moduli potential must be lifted after the phase transition . the above condition for the inhomogeneous electroweak phase transition might seem very severe , but in string theory there is at least one specific example that may induce an inhomogeneous phase transition at the electroweak scale .",
    "we consider intersecting d - brane models , which are an interesting possibility for string model building , allowing us to devise models that are sensibly close to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in terms of particles and gauge groups @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this scenario is that the flavor structure of the yukawa couplings may arise from the matter fields located at different intersections , with the resulting yukawa couplings expressed by the classical instanton action of the minimal world - sheet area : @xmath120 where @xmath0 is the minimal world - sheet area of the intersection .",
    "if the model is constructed from d6-branes in type iia string theory wrapping orientifolds of @xmath121@xcite , there will be shift symmetries that correspond to the brane motion in the internal space .",
    "if the shift symmetries are not broken in the effective action , the minimal world - sheet area remains as an arbitrary parameter .",
    "considering moduli fields @xmath122 , @xmath123 for the three branes constituting a triangle in the internal space , we find ; @xmath124 it would be better for our purpose to consider a simple form of @xmath125 and consider the inhomogeneity @xmath126 to obtain @xmath127 let us consider a possible mechanism for generating an effective potential related to @xmath0 .",
    "assuming that the yukawa couplings are generated by the mechanism and considering the standard one - loop correction to the higgs field potential from the top fermion loop , we obtain for @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes the scalar top mass@xcite . here",
    "we consider @xmath130 . in the mssm",
    ", the one - loop correction from the top yukawa coupling destabilizes the higgs potential and causes electroweak symmetry breaking . from the one - loop correction term in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) , we find that the world - sheet area can be stabilized after the electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite . in this case , the free motion of the d6-branes in the internal space is protected by the shift symmetry before the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , after the electroweak symmetry breaking , which is induced by the loop correction in the mssm electroweak symmetry - breaking scenario , the shift symmetries are partly broken and the minimal world - sheet area is stabilized in the low - energy effective action .",
    "although the scenario depends greatly on the specific details of the intersecting brane models , a generic implication of the scenario is that the inhomogeneous phase transition occurs whenever the shift symmetries are not explicitly broken before the phase transition .",
    "a similar mechanism may work at the gut phase transition , and the inhomogeneous phase transition may lead to a cosmological signature of the intersecting brane models .",
    "we have studied a mechanism for generating primordial density perturbations in inflationary models .",
    "we considered long - wavelength inhomogeneities of light scalar fields that cause superhorizon fluctuations of couplings and masses in the effective low - energy action .",
    "since the effective couplings and masses are not homogeneous in space , cosmological phase transitions may occur that are not simultaneous in space .",
    "it is possible to create the primordial curvature perturbation from the mechanism , but more generally the scenario of an inhomogeneous phase transition allows for non - gaussianity to occur in the spectrum after inflation @xcite .",
    "it is useful to specify the level of non - gaussianity by the non - linear parameter @xmath131 , which is usually defined by the bardeen potential @xmath132 , @xmath133 using the bardeen potential , the curvature perturbation @xmath40 is given by @xmath134 when we consider `` additional '' non - gaussianity created at the inhomogeneous phase transition , the first - order perturbation is generated dominantly by the usual inflaton perturbation .",
