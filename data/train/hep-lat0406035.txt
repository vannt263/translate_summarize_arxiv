    "moderate - length high - temperature ( ht ) expansions ( through order 12 ) and low - temperature ( lt ) expansions for the spin - spin correlation function ( sscf ) @xmath1 of the nearest - neighbor ising models with general spin s were first computed@xcite three decades ago on various lattices in 2d and in 3d .",
    "motivations for the study of these models came not only from their direct phenomenological interest , but mainly from the conjecture@xcite that , in a given space dimension , the exponents characterizing the critical behavior are independent both of the lattice structure and of the spin magnitude @xmath0 .",
    "this conjecture was the first step towards the modern notion of universality class .",
    "in the same years also the hypothesis of critical scaling@xcite was put forward .",
    "many studies@xcite of the mentioned ht and lt series were devoted to test the validity and the main consequences of these basic hypotheses@xcite .",
    "although the results sometimes were not as precise as was hoped , or covered only the @xmath2 case , the scaling tests suggested that the critical sscf is a homogeneous function of appropriate variables , while the universality tests indicated that the critical indices and suitable combinations@xcite of critical amplitudes are independent of the spin @xmath0 and lattice structure .",
    "a few years later , the first substantial extension@xcite of ht ising series in 3d ( through order 21 on the body - centered - cubic(bcc ) lattice only ) did not make higher expansion coefficients available for the sscf , but only for its two lowest even moments and therefore various tests could not be repeated and updated .    we are now resuming the ht part of those pioneering analyses in order to improve their extent and accuracy by taking advantage of our recent extension@xcite from order @xmath3 through order @xmath4 of the ht expansions for the sscf of the ising model with general spin @xmath0 , in 2d on the square ( sq ) lattice and in 3d on the simple - cubic ( sc ) and the bcc lattices . from these data we have also derived series for related quantities , in particular for a variety of moments of the sscf , which are computed through order 25 , and for the exponential ( or ` true ' ) correlation length defined via the exponential decay of the sscf , which , however , can be extended only through order 19 . for reasons of space we have not tabulated in this paper the series analysed , but have included them into our on - line library@xcite of ht data for the spin-@xmath0 ising model in order to make them more widely available for further study . since this is the largest body of series data so far computed for these systems , we have already been studying other aspects of them in previous papers . in particular , in ref.@xcite we have accurately confirmed that the residual weak spin - dependence observed@xcite in lower order studies of the susceptibility exponent @xmath5 and of the correlation - length exponent @xmath6 in 3d on the bcc lattice , should not be ascribed to small violations of universality , but can be simply explained away as numerical inaccuracies due to expected non - negligible spin - dependent corrections to the leading scale behavior .",
    "moreover we have tested the universality of several amplitude combinations obtaining similar results . in ref.@xcite an analogous survey of universal quantities",
    "was performed in 2d for the sq lattice case .",
    "shorter series ( but only for the @xmath2 case ) had been analysed in refs.@xcite .    from the evidence presented here",
    "we can conclude that our ht data for the sscf have by now reached an extension sufficient to make the use of modern series - extrapolation techniques possible and generally reliable .",
    "therefore we are able to exhibit more convincingly both in 2d and in 3d many expected properties related to scaling and universality also in some cases in which the old analyses led to inconclusive or not very precise results .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section ii we shall outline the main features of the model , introduce our notations and conventions and very briefly recall the scaling and universality properties expected for the sscf along with the corresponding tests discussed in full detail by the above cited papers@xcite .",
    "therefore , in section iii we can restrict ourselves to only a few comments on the numerical results .",
    "the spin-@xmath0 ising models with nearest - neighbor interaction are defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the exchange coupling , and @xmath9 with @xmath10 a classical spin variable at the lattice site @xmath11 , taking the @xmath12 values @xmath13 .",
    "the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites . for simplicity",
    ", the nearest - neighbor lattice spacing will be set equal to @xmath14 everywhere .",
    "we shall consider expansions in the usual ht variable @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the temperature , @xmath17 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath18 will be called `` inverse temperature '' for brevity . in the critical region",
    "we shall also refer to the standard ` reduced - temperature ' variable @xmath19 .",
    "we shall study the ht expansion of the ( connected ) sscf defined as @xmath20 in order to estimate numerically @xmath1 as @xmath21 , we have allowed for its expected@xcite behavior : in the 2d case @xmath22 and in the 3d case @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the critical amplitude of the leading singular correction , @xmath25@xcite denotes the critical exponent of the specific heat in 3d and the dots indicate higher order corrections .",

    "in particular , if @xmath43 is directed along a lattice axis , we have @xmath53 for the sq and the sc lattices , while @xmath54 for the bcc lattice .",
    "so far , 3d data for this quantity were published exclusively for @xmath2 , and did not extend beyond order 15 in the sc lattice case@xcite or beyond order 10 in the bcc lattice case@xcite . in 2d",
    "the ht expansion can be computed exactly @xcite for @xmath2 , but no data have been published for @xmath55 . in ref.@xcite , we have tabulated the expansion of @xmath56 through order 19 for @xmath52 directed along a lattice axis , in the case of the sq , sc and bcc lattices and with @xmath57 .    in order to avoid possible confusion , it should be pointed out that in ref.@xcite our @xmath58 was denoted by @xmath59 , while the symbol @xmath60 was used to denote @xmath61 .",
    "our notation might be more suggestive since our @xmath58 compares very closely with @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , the true and second - moment correlation - lengths are almost identical in magnitude above the critical temperature .",
    "in particular on the sq lattice , when @xmath43 is directed along a lattice axis , the ht expansion coefficients of @xmath63 and @xmath62 coincide through sixth order for @xmath2 , through fourth order for @xmath64 and through second order for higher values of the spin . in 3d , in the sc lattice case",
    ", the expansion coefficients of @xmath63 and @xmath62 coincide through seventh order for @xmath2 , through fifth order for @xmath64 and through third order for higher values of @xmath0 . in the case of the bcc lattice ,",
    "the expansion coefficients coincide through third order for all values of the spin .",
    "moreover , up to the maximum order of our computation , the noncoinciding coefficients differ by less than @xmath65 .    the two correlation lengths @xmath66 and @xmath67 are expected to share the same critical exponent @xmath6 so that their asymptotic behavior when @xmath21 can be written as @xmath68 \\label{asbxsm}\\ ] ] and @xmath69 \\label{asbxtrue}\\ ] ]    here the critical amplitude @xmath70 is independent of @xmath43 , since the sscf becomes spherically symmetric near the critical point .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 is a universal combination of critical amplitudes@xcite i.e. it is expected to depend only on the lattice dimensionality @xmath39 , but not on the spin @xmath0 or the lattice structure .    for @xmath72 and in zero magnetic field",
    ", the sscf is expected to exhibit the asymptotic structure @xmath73 when both @xmath42 and @xmath67 are much larger than the lattice spacing ( with arbitrary @xmath74 ) .",
    "eq.([scalfun ] ) together with these assumptions on @xmath42 and @xmath67 , is usually referred to as the `` strong - scaling hypothesis '' ( while it is called the `` weak - scaling hypothesis '' , if its validity is restricted to the @xmath75 limit with fixed @xmath74 ) . in eq.([scalfun ] ) , @xmath76 is the critical exponent describing the decay of the sscf at the critical point , @xmath77 is called the critical scaling function , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are scale factors .",
    "the dots indicate subcritical corrections proportional to a positive power of some irrelevant field .",
    "the scaling function @xmath77 is expected to be universal : its structure does not depend on the particular model under study provided that it belongs to a given universality class . on the contrary the scale factors @xmath80 depend on the spin and the lattice @xmath81 .",
    "the validity of the asymptotic structure eq.([scalfun ] ) was verified analytically@xcite for the spin @xmath2 ising model in 2d .    for the scattering function",
    "@xmath45 the analogous scaling form as @xmath21 can be written as @xmath82 if the scale factors @xmath83 are specified adopting the normalization conditions @xmath84 one can write@xcite as @xmath85 @xmath86 where the function @xmath87 is universal and thus the quantities @xmath88    @xmath89    with @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 , while @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 , have finite universal values as @xmath21 .",
    "all @xmath96 , as well as the difference @xmath97 , vanish@xcite in the mean - field related approximations",
    ". therefore the magnitudes of these quantities at the critical point can be taken as a measure of the deviation of a given system from gaussian behavior , which turns out to be very small on the ht side of the critical point .    more generally , it was observed@xcite that the scaling hypothesis eq.([scalfun ] ) implies that , at the critical point , the ratios @xmath98 with @xmath99 , are universal .",
    "these ratios are dominated by the critical singularity also for negative values of the indices @xmath100 provided that each index exceeds @xmath101 , as follows from eq.([asbsm ] ) .    finally , the determination of the amplitude @xmath24 of the leading singularity of the sscf ( see eqs.([singpart2d ] ) and ( [ singpart3d ] ) ) gives another opportunity to perform universality and scaling tests . in order that the structure of eqs.([singpart2d ] ) and ( [ singpart3d ] ) be compatible@xcite with the strong - scaling hypothesis eq.([scalfun ] ) , the amplitudes @xmath102 must scale as @xmath103 with @xmath104 , namely @xmath105 for large enough @xmath42 , independently of the spin and the lattice structure . in 2d",
    "the value @xmath106 is expected , while in 3d , adopting our recent estimate@xcite of the values of the correlation length exponent @xmath107 and of the exponent @xmath108 , we should have @xmath109 .",
    "let us first observe that , due to the leading singular corrections in eqs.([singpart2d ] ) and ( [ singpart3d ] ) , whose amplitudes @xmath24 grow with @xmath42 as indicated by eq.([e(r ) ] ) , determining accurately @xmath110 ( as well as @xmath24 itself ) is a rather delicate matter for which it is crucial to rely on sufficiently many expansion coefficients .",
    "we should also consider that the number of non - trivial coefficients in our series decreases with increasing @xmath42 , and correspondingly the precision of our estimates of @xmath111 ( and @xmath112 ) deteriorates .",
    ".our estimates of the critical - point values @xmath110 of the spin - spin correlation function for the nearest - neighbor ising models with spin @xmath113 on the sq , sc and bcc lattices . for comparison with our results ,",
    "the first column labelled @xmath114 $ ] shows the only available previous estimates . in the case of the sq lattice",
    ", we have cited the exact@xcite values . in the case of the nearest - neighbor correlation ( @xmath115 ) on the sc lattice ,",
    "we have reported in the first column the estimate obtained using our numerical procedure with the series @xmath116 of ref.@xcite and have also cited a value@xcite obtained in a recent high - precision montecarlo simulation . in the remaining cases",
    "we have reported the estimates of ref.@xcite obtained from series @xmath117 .",
    "we are not aware of previous calculations for @xmath118 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results of our analysis of the universal ratios @xmath119 are reported in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "they also show independence of the spin and of the lattice structure within a good precision .",
    "our series - extrapolation procedure , based on first- and second - order da s uses only our estimates of @xmath120 and does not need to be biased also with @xmath5 and @xmath6 as it was necessary in the generalized neville procedure@xcite employed with the short series of ref.@xcite .",
    "considering that the values @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( or @xmath123 ) of the exponents accepted at the time of that study are somewhat different from the currently preferred ones and that the extrapolations are very sensitive to those values , a comparison with the numerical results of ref.@xcite has little meaning .      in 2d , on the sq lattice , the non - trivial expansion coefficients of the ratio @xmath125 are not sufficiently many and their behavior is not smooth enough to yield very accurate results",
    ". therefore our best estimate of @xmath124 ( by first - order da s biased with @xmath120 ) can not be more precise than @xmath126 , independently of @xmath0 .",
    "our rough estimate is , however , consistent with the more accurate determination @xmath127 obtained in the @xmath2 case in which , as already indicated above , very long series are available@xcite for @xmath128 , while @xmath129 is exactly known@xcite .    in 3d we can use both first- and second - order da s biased with @xmath120 .",
    "the very smooth bcc lattice series yield the most accurate results .",
    "our final estimate is @xmath130 , independently of @xmath0 and of the lattice structure .",
    "so far , this ratio could be computed@xcite only for @xmath2 from a 15 term series on the sc lattice , with the result @xmath131 .",
    "a more precise estimate@xcite @xmath132 was obtained indirectly ( and assuming universality ) , from optimized ht series for a continuous - spin model on the sc lattice . within the renormalization group approach@xcite ,",
    "the estimate @xmath133 was obtained in the @xmath134-expansion to third order , while the coupling - constant expansion technique to fourth order gave @xmath135 .",
