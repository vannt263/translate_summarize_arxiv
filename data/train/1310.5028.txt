    "single transverse spin asymmetries ( stsas ) generated in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and in hadronic collisions are one of the hot topics of research in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , promising unparalleled insight in the physics of chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement . in the factorization framework involving transverse momentum - dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) @xcite the origin of stsas",
    "is chiefly ascribed to either the quark tmds ( sivers effect @xcite ) , to multiple partonic rescattering @xcite , or to the quark fragmentation functions ( collins effect @xcite ) .    while both the quark tmd and the fragmentation function are non - perturbative , and , according to the conventional wisdom , can not be calculated form first principles , it is desirable to understand the detailed physical mechanism leading to generation of stsas in qcd . to that end",
    "a significant progress has been achieved by brodsky , hwang and schmidt ( bhs ) in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where , in a quark  di - quark proton model calculation , it has been shown that the stsa in sidis can be generated through an interference of the final - state parton rescattering diagram with the born - level amplitude .",
    "in essence , it was shown in @xcite that multiple partonic rescatterings are key to generating the asymmetry .",
    "the multiple rescatterings are often referred to as the `` lensing '' interaction , since , in sidis , the associated color - lorentz force tries to attract the knocked - out quarks back into the hadron @xcite , thus `` focusing '' them .",
    "the effects of such multiple rescatterings can be absorbed into the sivers distribution function of a polarized hadron in sidis @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this understanding of the origin of stsa in sidis , is that the sivers function ( and , hence , the asymmetry itself ) has to change sign between sidis and the drell - yan process ( dy ) . at the level of the operator matrix element",
    "this conclusion has been reached in @xcite , while an illustration of this result in the bhs model was completed only recently @xcite ( see also @xcite for the outline of the calculation ) .",
    "it is our understanding that in the `` lensing '' interpretation of stsas this sign change corresponds to the color - lorentz force changing sign from attractive to repulsive between a knocked - out quark in sidis and the incoming anti - quark in dy .",
    "the goal of the present work is to extend our understanding of the physical mechanism behind the stsa beyond the quark  di - quark model of the proton used in @xcite ( see @xcite for other efforts in a similar direction ) . in particular ,",
    "multiple partonic rescatterings in high energy scattering can be particularly simply accounted for in the framework of the quasi - classical approximation to qcd employed in the glauber  mueller ( gm ) @xcite and , equivalently , mclerran  venugopalan ( mv ) @xcite models . in these approaches",
    "the hadron is modeled by a large nucleus , with a large number @xmath0 of nucleons in it .",
    "the large number of nucleons leads to high density of small-@xmath1 gluons in the nuclear wave function , which , in turn , generates a hard scale @xmath2 known as the parton saturation scale , justifying the use of perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "( for reviews of the saturation / color glass condensate ( cgc ) physics see @xcite . )",
    "the fact that the quasi - classical approximation generates a hard scale justifying the approach indicates that it is not simply a `` model '' of qcd , but , in fact , it represents a limiting behavior of strong interactions at high energy .",
    "multiple rescatterings can be resummed in the gm / mv model as an expansion in powers of the parameter @xmath3 @xcite : the presence of a resummation parameter allows for a controlled approximation to the problem at hand . in the past",
    "there was a number of efforts to include spin effects in the saturation / cgc framework @xcite .    to alleviate the worry about whether a large nucleus can adequately represent a proton ( or any other hadron ) in sidis and dy experiments , let us point out that in unpolarized scattering the proton may have a significant number of non - perturbatively  generated large-@xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) partons , which are modeled by `` nucleons '' in this large - nucleus approximation .",
    "the large-@xmath1 partons/nucleons  , in turn , give rise to small-@xmath1 gluons .",
    "the resulting expressions for the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions have been quite successful in describing hera low-@xmath1 data @xcite , also indicating relevance of the large-nucleus  approximation to the proton wave function at small-@xmath1 .    in",
    "what follows we would have to slightly modify the original mv model of the nucleus by giving the `` nucleus '' both a non - zero spin and a non - zero orbital angular momentum ( oam ) . here",
    "this would mean that free nucleons in an approximately spherical bag , as considered originally in @xcite , would now be polarized and would be orbiting the nuclear spin axis . in a realistic polarized nucleus",
    "the nucleons tend to form pairs with zero net oam , such that the net spin of the nucleus is carried by the few unpaired nucleons and does not get very large ( does not grow directly with @xmath0 ) . since it is not clear whether such effect ( at the level of quarks and gluons ) takes place in the proton we are trying to model , we will not make any particular assumptions about the polarizations and oams of the nucleons in our `` nucleus '' .",
    "the main physical mechanism for generating stsa in the quasi - classical framework is as follows .",
    "imagine a large spinning nucleus .",
    "the nucleus is so large that it is almost completely opaque to a colored probe .",
    "this strong nuclear shadowing is due to multiple rescatterings in the nucleus generating a short mean free path for the quark , anti - quark , or a gluon .",
    "let us first consider the drell - yan process on such a rotating nucleus with shadowing , as shown in in the nuclear rest frame with the rotation axis of the nucleus perpendicular to the collision axis .",
    "the incoming anti - quark ( generated in the wave function of the other hadron ) scatters on the `` front '' surface of the polarized nucleus due to the strong shadowing . since the anti - quark interacts with the nucleons which",
    ", at the `` front '' of the nucleus preferentially rotate with the nucleus out of the plane of the page in , the produced time - like virtual photons are produced preferentially out of the page , generating left - of - polarized - beam single spin asymmetry .",
    "the same mechanism can be applied to generate stsa in sidis , as illustrated in , also in the rest frame of the nucleus .",
    "now the incoming virtual photon interacts with the transversely polarized nucleus , producing a quark . for the quark to escape out of the nucleus and be produced the interaction has to take place at the `` back '' of the nucleus , to minimize the path the quark needs to travel through the nucleus , maximizing its chances to escape .",
    "the nucleons in the `` back '' of the nucleus rotate preferentially into the page of : scattering of a virtual photon on such nucleons results in the right - of - beam single spin asymmetry for the outgoing quarks ( quarks produced preferentially with transverse momentum pointing into the page ) .",
    "spin asymmetries in dy and sidis shown in figs .",
    "[ dy_fig ] and [ sidis_fig ] are generated through a combination of oam effects and nuclear shadowing .",
    "the two asymmetries are opposite - sign ( left- and right - of - beam ) , and , assuming that scattering in the two processes happens equal distance from the nuclear edge , are likely to be equal in magnitude , in agreement with the prediction of @xcite .    as we will see below in the actual calculations , the stsas in figs .",
    "[ dy_fig ] and [ sidis_fig ] do require multiple rescatterings , but they are needed solely to generate nuclear shadowing .",
    "thus the physical mechanism of figs .",
    "[ dy_fig ] and [ sidis_fig ] is quite different from the `` lensing '' interaction @xcite , in which the knocked - out quark in sidis `` feels '' the net color charge of the remainder of the proton , and is attracted back by this charge @xcite . in the presence of shadowing , it would be much harder for the quark in sidis to `` see '' the whole remainder of the polarized proton ( nucleus ) coherently : thus one expects the `` lensing '' effect to weaken with increasing shadowing ( if we could increase shadowing without modifying the degree of the polarization of the nucleus ) .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the mechanism in figs .",
    "[ dy_fig ] and [ sidis_fig ] , in which the asymmetry actually increases with shadowing .",
    "clearly , the more opaque the nucleus is , the more likely the interactions to happen at its `` front '' in dy and at its `` back '' in sidis , making the asymmetry larger .    in the paper below we will outline the calculations leading to the physical picture presented in figs .",
    "[ dy_fig ] and [ sidis_fig ] . after some generalities in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sidis ] with the quasi - classical analysis of stsa in sidis . as mentioned above , to model the oam of a polarized nucleus we have to assume that the nucleus is rotating .",
    "this implies a generalization of the original mv and gm models , in which nucleons are static , to include rotational motion of the nucleons .",
    "hence the nucleons need to have both the well - defined positions and momenta : this is only possible in the classical limit .",
    "the classical mv model limit is achieved in sec .",
    "[ sec : sidis ] using the wigner functions approach , which allows to specify both the positions and momenta of the nucleons in the polarized nucleus .",
    "we then proceed to the calculation of stsa in sidis , identifying two mechanisms for stsa generation : one is due to the coupling of the produced quarks transverse momentum to the oam of the nucleus , while another one is due to the stsa generated in the scattering of the virtual photon on an individual nucleon along the lines of the bhs mechanism @xcite ( sivers function density ) .",
    "the former mechanism is leading in the saturation framework , being dominant in the saturation power counting ( for non - zero oam ) : it is order - one for @xmath5 .",
    "the latter mechanism is order-@xmath6 for @xmath5 , and is thus subleading .    at large values of the produced quark transverse momentum @xmath7",
    "the oam mechanism gives the contribution to the sivers function of the order @xmath8 with @xmath9 the typical transverse momentum of the valence quarks in the polarized nucleus due to orbital motion and @xmath10 the nucleon mass ( with @xmath11 roughly the constituent quark mass ) , while the sivers function density gives a contribution proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that @xmath13 , we see that the sivers function density mechanism dominates for @xmath14 ; conversely , the oam mechanism is dominant for @xmath15 , the domain including everything inside of the saturation region and a phase - space sector outside of that region .",
    "a similar quasi - classical stsa calculation is carried out for the drell - yan process in sec .",
    "[ sec : dy ] , where we also explicitly show the mechanism for the sign reversal of the sivers function outlined in this introduction .",
    "we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] by summarizing our results and outlining possible improvements of our results left for the future work .",
    "the single transverse spin asymmetry is defined as @xmath16 for producing a hadron with transverse momentum @xmath17 in sidis on a transversely polarized target and in polarized proton ",

    "below , when considering sidis and dy , we will work in the light - cone gauge of the projectile .",
    "choosing the polarized proton ( nucleus ) to move along the light - cone @xmath31-direction , such that @xmath32 is large , we will work in the @xmath33 gauge . in the quasi - classical approximation",

    "as will become apparent below , the direction of the wilson lines in the @xmath40 s is given by the direction of motion of the outgoing quark in sidis and the incoming anti - quark in dy .",
    "this results in different definitions of the correlator @xmath41 for the two processes , which is usually referred to as the controlled process - dependence of the tmds @xcite .",

    "we first consider the process of quark production in semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering on a transversely polarized heavy nucleus : @xmath48 .",
    "the leptonic tensor can be factorized out in the usual way , so we represent the process as the scattering of a virtual photon : @xmath49 .",
    "this photon carries a large spacelike virtuality @xmath50 and knocks out a quark from one of the nucleons , which may then rescatter on the nuclear remnants .",
    "the nucleus is taken in the classical gm / mv approximation , which we augment by requiring that the nucleons are polarized and the nucleus rotates around the transverse spin axis , which leads to a non - zero oam .",

    "we will model nucleons as made out of single valence quarks : in the end of the calculation , to go back to the nucleons one simply would need to replace distribution functions in a valence quark by the distribution functions in the nucleons .",
    "let us denote the photon - nucleus center - of - mass energy squared by @xmath58 and the photon - nucleon ( valence quark ) center - of - mass energy squared by @xmath59 .",
    "we consider the kinematic limit @xmath60 and work to leading order in the small kinematic quantities @xmath61 , which we denote collectively as @xmath62 . since we are operating in the limit in which @xmath63 , the formalism of tmd factorization applies , justifying the use of the correlator and decomposition .",
    "additionally , to a good accuracy one can assume that a typical scale for the momentum fraction @xmath64 is @xmath65 , where @xmath0 is the mass number of the nucleus ( in fact , @xmath66 for the single - valence quark `` nucleons '' at hand ) .",

    ", @xmath81 we see that the photon s coherence length is short , but the coherence length of the ejected quark is parametrically large for @xmath82 .",
    "thus , for our calculation in which @xmath83 , the virtual photon interacts incoherently ( locally ) on a single nucleon , but the ejected quark interacts coherently with all of the remaining nucleons it encounters before escaping the nucleus .",
    "this limit thus combines the local `` knockout '' picture of the deep inelastic scattering process with the coherent rescattering that usually characterizes the small-@xmath1 limit . in the formal limit of a large nucleus in which @xmath84 and @xmath85 such that @xmath86 , these coherent interactions with subsequent nucleons must be re - summed according to this saturation - based power counting .",
    "in general it is rather straightforward to write an answer for the quasi - classical quark production in sidis . as we mentioned in the introduction , here",
    "the problem is a little more subtle than usual since we are interested in also including transverse and longitudinal motion of the nucleons in the nucleus in order to model its oam .",
    "thus our quasi - classical description of the nucleus has to provide us both with the positions and momenta of the nucleons .",
    "this can be done using wigner distributions .",
    "let us illustrate the method with a simple single - rescattering process from .",
    "just like in the parton model , the time scale of inter - nucleon interactions is lorentz - dilated in the infinite momentum frame of the nucleus that we are working in",
    ". we can , therefore , write the scattering amplitude for the process in as a product of the light - cone wave function @xmath87 of the valence quarks in the nucleus ( defined according to light - front perturbation theory rules @xcite in the boost - invariant convention of @xcite ) with the quark  virtual photon scattering amplitude @xmath88 : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the boost - invariant light - cone wave function of a valence quark ( in one of the nucleons ) in the nucleus , while @xmath88 is the scattering amplitude for the `` knock - out '' process @xmath91 .",
    "the sum over valence quark spin and color is implied in . in calculating the quark production process",
    "we need to square this amplitude , integrate it over the momentum of the final state gluon and sum over all nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "since momenta @xmath92 and @xmath93 are fixed , this amounts to integrating over @xmath94 .",
    "one gets @xmath95    first let us introduce a fourier transform of the valence quark wave function , @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "next we define the wigner distribution for the valence quarks ( which is closely related to the wigner distribution of the nucleons in the quasi - classical mv model employed here ) with the help of the fourier transform : @xmath98 note that the wave function is normalized such that @xmath99 giving @xmath100 since @xmath101 we can recast as @xmath102    finally , in the following , as usual in the saturation framework , it would be convenient to calculate the scattering amplitude in ( partial ) transverse coordinate space .",
    "writing @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 and @xmath105 fixed by eqs .   and )",
    "we rewrite as @xmath106    note that the fourier transform appears to imply that @xmath107 is the transverse position of the outgoing gluon in , whereas in the wigner distribution @xmath107 is the position of the valence quark @xmath94 .",
    "as we will shortly see such interpretation is not inconsistent : in the classical limit of a large nucleus the wigner distribution is a slowly varying function of @xmath108 , with changes in @xmath109 becoming significant over the variations of @xmath108 over distances of the order of nucleon size 1 fm or larger .",
    "the valence quark and outgoing gluon in are perturbatively close to each other ( being the part of the same feynman diagram ) , and hence the difference in their positions is outside the precision of @xmath110 and can be taken to be the same in the wigner distribution .    in appendix  [ a ]",
    "we show that the formula holds not only at the lowest order , but when multiple rescatterings are included as well , such that in the kinematics outlined above @xmath111 where we define the energy - independent ( at the lowest non - trivial order ) @xmath112 scattering amplitudes by ( see also eqs .   and )",

    "therefore , the ( anti)symmetrized distributions have definite parity under @xmath444 : @xmath445 =     + w_\\sigma^{symm}(p,\\overline{b } ) \\\\     w_\\sigma^{oam}(p , b ) & \\equiv \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ w_\\sigma(p , b ) -       ( { \\underline{p } } \\rightarrow - { \\underline{p } } ) \\right ] = -     w_\\sigma^{oam}(p,\\overline{b } ) .   \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .   tells us that a consequence of @xmath209 invariance in the nucleus is that the orbital angular momentum encountered at any point in the front of the nucleus is compensated by an equal and opposite orbital angular momentum from a corresponding point on the back of the nucleus .",
    "this is the resolution to the apparent paradox : when we neglect all wilson line contributions ( both @xmath253 $ ] and @xmath175 ) , the net asymmetry in the quark distribution is zero since @xmath446 . hence neglecting all wilson line contributions yields zero sivers function , consistent with @xcite .",
    "an essential role is played in , then , by the rescattering factor @xmath253 $ ] . in the oam channel , even though the rescattering @xmath447 $ ] is not the source of a preferred transverse direction , without it the net contribution to the sivers function from oam would vanish after integration over @xmath134 , as can be gleaned from the left panel in .",
    "the rescattering factor @xmath253 $ ] is essential because it introduces shadowing that breaks this front - back symmetry by screening quarks ejected from the front of the nucleus more than those ejected the back .",
    "the sivers function relevant for sidis is therefore more sensitive to oam from the back of the nucleus than from the front , which prevents the complete cancellation of the oam contribution as in .",
    "this analysis is strikingly similar to the arguments that historically established the existence of the sivers function . as collins argued in @xcite , @xmath209-invariance of any hadronic eigenstate prohibits a preferred direction that can generate the sivers function .",
    "this is directly reflected in the vanishing of without the effects of multiple rescattering . and",
    "as brodsky , hwang , and schmidt demonstrated in @xcite , the rescattering represented by the semi - infinite wilson lines breaks this symmetry and permits a preferred direction for the asymmetry . unlike that calculation , however , here the rescattering does not occur as color - correlated `` lensing '' due to rescattering on the remnants of the active quark . here",
    "the interaction is explicitly color - decorrelated because the rescattering occurs on many nucleons whose colors are not correlated . despite this difference ,",
    "the rescattering effects are still sufficient to break the front - back symmetry and give rise to a net preferred direction for the asymmetry .",
