    "g.  _ _ from  @xcite ) the area radius  @xmath6 and the hawking mass  @xmath7 defined on @xmath2 .",
    "our assumption on @xmath2 is basically that it strictly contain a complete domain of outer communications @xmath8 , bounded in the future and past by an event horizon , more precisely , that it contain a region whose conformal diagram looks like : @xmath9 null geodesics whose endpoint in the above diagram lies on null infinity have in fact infinite affine length ; null infinity is thus not contained in @xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", we assume that the points on the event horizon are contained in @xmath2 .",
    "the event horizon is the union of a future directed null geodesic ray ( denoted @xmath10 ) and a past directed ray ( denoted @xmath11 ) . as in the diagram , we require these rays to intersect , _",

    "see section 4 . ]",
    "since @xmath2 is open , this means that all inextendible null rays emanating from points of @xmath8 either cross the event horizon and leave @xmath8 or have infinite affine length .",
    "we also assume @xmath6 is bounded below on @xmath8 by a positive constant .",
    "we will assume furthermore that the domain of outer communications admits an isometry @xmath13 , which descends to @xmath2 , _",
    "i.  e. _ , such that it induces an isometry on @xmath8 such that @xmath14 , etc .",
    "this latter part follows for instance if we assume that the action of @xmath1 on @xmath15 is unique .",
    "moreover , we will assume @xmath13 takes some point @xmath16 to its future , i.e.  @xmath17 .",
    "the orbit @xmath18 must be contained in the timelike line @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , since the distance between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is non - zero and must equal to the distance between @xmath22 and @xmath18 , it follows that @xmath18 approaches future timelike infinity , and @xmath23 approaches future past timelike infinity .",
    "in particular , given any point @xmath24 , there will be a @xmath25 in @xmath26 , and a @xmath27 in @xmath28 .",

    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for a derivation of the einstein equations in spherical symmetry with a general energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we will assume here that these equations are satisfied pointwise ( _ i .",

    "here we always select @xmath4 such that null geodesic rays from points of @xmath8 generated by @xmath40 are future - directed and have infinite affine length ( i.  e.  `` terminate '' on null infinity ) .",
    "it follows from @xmath41 that @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath8 that @xmath6 will have to become zero after a finite affine length in the direction of a null geodesic that terminates at the event horizon , a contradiction . ] and then , from @xmath44 that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we then have the following    let @xmath13 be an isometry of the domain of outer communications @xmath8 as described in the previous section .",
    "it follows that @xmath47 and @xmath48 on @xmath10 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 on @xmath11 .",
    "_ the proof is by contradiction .",

    "again , by the relation @xmath57 it follows that @xmath64 .",
    "now the assumption on @xmath13 implies that there exists an @xmath65 such that @xmath66 for all @xmath67 .",
    "but since @xmath13 is an isometry @xmath68 .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "one can then apply the same argument with @xmath7 in place of @xmath6 , and then for @xmath11 replacing @xmath10 , thus completing the proof .",
    "@xmath69    in virtue of the equation @xmath70 and the boundedness of @xmath71 , it follows from the above proposition that since @xmath48 and @xmath47 on @xmath10 and similarly @xmath72 on @xmath11 , we have @xmath73 on @xmath10 and @xmath74 on @xmath11 .    we now proceed to outline the more restrictive assumptions on the structure of the matter which will be necessary for our results .",
    "the first set of assumptions reflects the structure of the energy - momentum tensor itself .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "@xmath75 where @xmath76 is a skew symmetric @xmath77-tensor , and @xmath78 takes values in some space endowed with a connection @xmath79 , such that if @xmath80 identically for all @xmath81 , then @xmath82 corresponds to the energy momentum tensor of a spherically symmetric electric field @xmath83 satisfying the source - free maxwell equations . here",
    "@xmath84 is the induced connection on @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   @xmath73 should imply @xmath85 , and @xmath74 should imply @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 , etc .",
    "one example of such a @xmath82 is the energy momentum tensor generated by a wave map @xmath88 interacting ( via the gravitational field only , since it does not carry charge ) in an electromagnetic field @xmath83 : @xmath89 a special case of the above is of course when @xmath65 is @xmath90 with the flat metric and @xmath91 is then a collection of @xmath92 real scalar fields .",
    "another example is the energy momentum tensor generated by a massive complex scalar field @xmath91 in an electromagnetic field @xmath83 with electromagnetic potential @xmath93 @xmath94    for @xmath82 satisfying @xmath95 and @xmath77 , it follows that @xmath85 on @xmath10 and @xmath86 on @xmath11 .",
    "since the restriction of a connection to a one - dimensional set is trivial , we can then choose coordinates for a space representing the degrees of freedom for @xmath78 such that @xmath78 is in fact constant on the event horizon .",
    "if in local coordinates @xmath96 the system of equations for @xmath78 , with @xmath83 , @xmath97 , and @xmath6 fixed , is of the form @xmath98 with @xmath76 a sufficiently regular function tensor , there is a regularity assumption on @xmath76 as well as on @xmath99 implicit in @xmath100 . ] , then the characteristic initial value problem with initial data on the event horizon is locally well posed , provided @xmath78 is assumed sufficiently regular  @xcite . , one should first redefine the metric @xmath97 to be its negative , so @xmath8 becomes @xmath101 .",
    "] if this equation admits the solution @xmath102 , then this must be the only solution in the vicinity of the horizon , and by a continuity argument , this domain of dependence property can be extended to guarantee uniqueness throughout @xmath8 .",
    "a sufficient condition for this is clearly @xmath103 .",
    "thus , in view of the fact that spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations are necessarily reissner - nordstrm , we have    if @xmath104 satisfies conditions 1 and 2 , and @xmath78 satisfies a system of the form @xmath100 , with @xmath105 , and if @xmath13 is as in proposition 1 , it follows that @xmath8 coincides with the domain of outer communications of a reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "note that the above theorem applies to the wave map system , which can be written @xmath106 where @xmath107 is an expression involving the christoffel symbols of @xmath108 .",
    "( compare with @xcite .",
    "the above argument reproves , in particular , the static result , and seems considerably easier , as it does not depend on the geometry of the target . ) also note that , in the above argument , we have not assumed that @xmath13 preserves @xmath78 , only that it preserves the metric .",
    "in fact , it suffice to assume that given any point @xmath21 , then for all @xmath109 there exists an @xmath110 such that @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "such solutions can be called `` almost periodic '' .",
    "unfortunately , as it stands , the argument of the previous section can not be applied in the case of a complex scalar field or a massive scalar field , for then the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath78 is not of the type described above . in particular , there do not exist constant non - zero solutions .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to compare here with the static case .",
    "the argument of bekenstein  @xcite , say for the scalar field @xmath113 with @xmath114 , goes roughly as follows : integrating the equality @xmath115 using gauss s theorem , the boundary contributions along the event horizon vanish , while the contributions along two spacelike curves which are carried to one another by the isometry cancel .",
    "moreover , the divergence is non - negative , since in a static solution @xmath116 is spacelike , and @xmath117 only if the solution vanishes .",
    "thus , either the solution is identically @xmath117 , or there must be a boundary contribution at infinity , i.e.  the solution does not decay as @xmath118 .",
    "( this would imply that the curvature does not decay , and thus the solution would not be asymptotically flat . )",
    "the above bochner - type method and arguments based on it can not be applied directly in the periodic case as @xmath116 may have negative length . with slightly more effort than in section 2 , one can show that for various examples of matter  including the case of a charged massive scalar field , for instance  our initial data determine a static solution , and then apply the above argument to show that this solution must thus not decay at infinity .",
    "the idea is similar in spirit to theorem 1 , except that now we will apply the uniqueness theorem to the solution of the characteristic value problem to a system of second order hyperbolic equations derived from killing s equation .",
    "first , we introduce the following new assumptions : letting @xmath119 , @xmath120 denote coordinates on @xmath121 , we assume    1 .",
    "@xmath47 on @xmath10 and @xmath49 on @xmath11 2 .",

    "follow for a large class of matter , including the case of a complex scalar field interacting in an electromagnetic field .",
    "( see the appendix . )",
    "we define @xmath4 and @xmath3 on the event horizon so as to yield an affine distance on the event horizon as measured from the point @xmath12 on @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , i.e.  we will be assuming that @xmath126 on @xmath127 .",
    "we now will define a particular null vector field @xmath128 on the event horizon , and extend it to @xmath8 as the unique solution of the initial value problem , with initial data on the event horizon , for the equation @xmath129 the choice of the definition will be to ensure that @xmath130 on @xmath127 . for now write @xmath131 and @xmath132 , where we will determine immediately following what @xmath133 and @xmath134 have to be .",

    ", it follows that @xmath163 on @xmath11 .    of course , to show that indeed we have @xmath155 on @xmath10 , for the @xmath128 defined above , it remains to show , in view of @xmath164 , that @xmath165 since the above equation is indeed true at @xmath12 , it follows that it is enough to show that @xmath166 , or , by @xmath167 , that @xmath168 assumption 2 together with the conservation of energy - momentum implies that @xmath169 , and assumption 3 implies that @xmath170 , and thus , @xmath171 where @xmath172 .",
    "thus we compute @xmath173 we can take then @xmath174 and we have found a nontrivial vector field vanishing at @xmath12 satisfying @xmath175 on @xmath10 , and similarly , @xmath175 on @xmath11 as well .",
    "denote now the totality of matter by @xmath176 . in terms of this @xmath128 defined , we assume further    1 .",
    "@xmath177 can be tricky to define if the equations have a gauge invariance .",
    "typically , this will mean that there is a choice of gauge for which the matter can be expressed by some @xmath176 for which @xmath177 .",
    "see the appendix for the case of a complex scalar field . ] on @xmath127 .",
    "the quanitities @xmath178 and @xmath179 satisfy a system of equations which , when everything else is treated as fixed , only admits the zero solution if they vanish on @xmath127 .",
    "all our assumptions taken together imply that we have produced a vector field @xmath128 such that @xmath175 , i.e.  a killing field @xmath128 on @xmath8 .",
    "note that a similar argument ensures that @xmath128 is also a killing field `` downstairs '' , i.e.  that @xmath180 . from this",
    ", it follows that @xmath128 must be timelike . since @xmath128 does not vanish identically on the event horizon",
    ", it follows that there exists a @xmath16 such that @xmath181 .",
    "thus @xmath128 does not vanish along the line @xmath19 , which must be the orbit @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes the one parameter group of isometries generated by @xmath128 .",

    "if it did at some point @xmath30 , then choosing a point @xmath184 on @xmath19 which can be connected to @xmath30 by a spacelike curve , then @xmath185 for large enough @xmath186 is in the future of @xmath187 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath183 is an isometry .",
    "we have thus proven    for an einstein - matter system satisfying assumptions 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 above , the domain of outer communications is static .",
    "in the case of dirac fields , the arguments outlined above do not apply because this matter does not satisfy the positive energy condition .",
    "this is related to the fact that the dirac field probably provides a reasonable model only after second quantization .",
    "but in fact , considerations regarding periodic solutions are even easier than in the previous section , and can be studied without applying the coupling with gravity , which played a central role in the previous argument .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for background on this problem in the uncoupled case , and to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the coupled static case . in particular , we recall the dirac matrices @xmath188 , which operate on dirac fields @xmath78 , which are sections of an appropriate spinor bundle",
    ". the precise form of the dirac equation will depend on the other matter fields present to which the field is coupled .",
    "we will simply assume that @xmath78 satisfies in local coordinates , after fixing the metric and the other matter fields , a _ linear _ equation of the form @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",
    "note that by squaring the dirac operator , it follows that @xmath78 satisfies a system @xmath191 we further assume that the vector field @xmath192 provides a positive current , i.e.   @xmath193 when @xmath194 is future directed and timelike , with equality only in the case where @xmath78 vanishes , and moreover , this current is conserved : @xmath195    we do not assume that @xmath78 is spherically symmetric , but we do assume that it is defined on a spherically symmetric domain of outer communications as before , preserved by an isometry @xmath13 , as before , in the sense that @xmath196    moreover , we assume that all other matter fields are spherically symmetric , and thus we can write @xmath78 as the sum of spherical harmonics each of which satisfy a wave equation of the form @xmath197 , but on @xmath2 , not on @xmath15 .    consider a spacelike curve @xmath198 which divides @xmath8 into two connected components , and intersects the event horizon at @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath199 be the future normal vector field to @xmath198 .",
    "fix a point @xmath30 on the event horizon and @xmath21 on @xmath198 .",
    "we denote the part of @xmath198 connecting @xmath21 with spacelike infinity by @xmath200 .",
    "then for an isometry @xmath13 as in proposition 1 , there exists an @xmath92 such that @xmath18 and @xmath30 can be connected by a spacelike curve @xmath201 : @xmath202 we will assume @xmath78 is locally bounded , and that @xmath203 the latter assumption is quite reasonable in view of the fact that this integral should equal to the probability of observing the particle on @xmath198 , which should be normalizable to something less than @xmath95 . now integrating the conservation law @xmath204 and applying gauss theorem , and since @xmath205 it follows that @xmath206 where the second line follows from the fact that @xmath13 is an isometry and @xmath207 .",
    "but as @xmath208 , the term on the right hand side approaches @xmath117 .",

    "is timelike , it follows by the positivity of the current that @xmath78 in fact vanishes there .",
    "it turns out that the behavior of @xmath78 on the event horizon , deduced above , together with the dirac equation , imply that @xmath78 vanishes identically on the event horizon :    choose coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 in a neighborhood of @xmath12 , such that , @xmath217 .",
    "it follows from the properties deduced above that a spinor representation can be chosen such that @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 on @xmath10 , while @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 on @xmath11 .    from the anticommutation relations it follows that @xmath224 , @xmath225 . multiplying the dirac equation @xmath226 by @xmath227 , and restricting to @xmath10 ,",

    "one argues in the same way to obtain that @xmath78 vanishes identically on @xmath11 .",
    "this condition completely determines initial data for the characteristic initial value problem for each of the spherical harmonics of the dirac equation ] , and thus assuming that @xmath78 is in a space sufficiently regular , all the spherical harmonics must vanish identically in @xmath8 by uniqueness of the solution of the characteristic initial value problem , and thus @xmath235 in @xmath8 .",
    "again , it is clear from the proof that one can replace the assumptions on @xmath13 with the assumption that for all @xmath21 , @xmath109 , there exist @xmath237 such that @xmath112 implies @xmath238 there is thus a sense in which the result holds for `` almost periodic solutions '' as well .",
    "as discussed in the beginning , the motivation for considering `` time - periodic '' solutions @xmath239 is as `` limiting '' final states of graviational collapse .",

    "relate to a particular choice of `` extension '' of @xmath176 beyond the event horizon , and they also seem to depend on the conformal geometry of the interior of the reissner - nordstrm black hole , a geometry which is thought to be unstable . it is unclear how any of these conditions are justified if we view @xmath2 as `` generated '' by the process outlined in the beginning of this section , and thus whether anything is gained by allowing _ a priori _ for a more singular behavior of @xmath176 .",
    "i thank piotr chruciel for some very useful discussions on a preliminary version of this paper .",
    "we will show that a complex scalar field indeed satisfies the assumptions of section 3 . to reduce the equations to a determined system , we will have to set a gauge .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> this paper explores `` black hole '' solutions of various einstein - wave matter systems admitting an isometry of their domain of outer communications taking every point to its future . in the first two parts </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that such solutions , assuming in addition that they are spherically symmetric and the matter has a certain structure , must be schwarzschild or reissner - nordstrm . </S>",
    "<S> non - trivial examples of matter for which the result applies are a wave map and a massive charged scalar field interacting with an electromagnetic field . the results thus generalize work of bekenstein  @xcite and heusler  @xcite from the static to the periodic case . in the third part , which is independent of the first two </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that dirac fields preserved by an isometry of a spherically symmetric domain of outer communications of the type desribed above must vanish . </S>",
    "<S> it can be applied in particular to the einstein - dirac - maxwell equations or the einstein - dirac - yang / mills equations , generalizing work of finster , smoller and yau  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and also @xcite .    for equations of evolution </S>",
    "<S> , time - periodic or stationary solutions often correspond to the late time behavior of solutions for a large class of initial data . in the general theory of relativity , time - periodic `` black hole '' </S>",
    "<S> solutions , if they exist , seem to provide reasonable candidates for the final state of gravitational collapse . </S>",
    "<S> such solutions can be defined as those invariant with respect to an isometry of the domain of outer communications which takes every point to its future , or more generally , such that points sufficiently close to infinity are mapped to their future .    in the case of a continuous family of isometries ( i.e. stationary and static solutions ) </S>",
    "<S> , this problem has a long history and goes under the name `` no hair '' conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite for a survey of results and a recent important refinement . </S>",
    "<S> current proofs depend on various extra assumptions and truly satisfactory theorems have only been obtained in the vacuum and electrovacuum static case .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to try to generalize some results from the static case to the spherically symmetric `` time - periodic '' case . </S>",
    "<S> the study of periodic solutions to the einstein equations was initiated in papapetrou @xcite @xcite ; see also @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analyses indicate that vacuum solutions which are periodic near null infinity should in fact be static there , but they are far from complete , and depend very much on analyticity assumptions on the nature of null infinity , assumptions which do not appear to be physically valid . </S>",
    "<S> this paper appears to be the first to address the issue of the existence of periodic solutions in a non - analytic setting , in particular , in a setting compatible with the evolutionary hypothesis .    </S>",
    "<S> after briefly setting some basic assumptions ( section 1 ) regarding spherical symmetry , we shall show in section 2 that for a certain class of matter , non - trivial spherically - symmetric black - hole phenomena can not be described by solutions invariant with respect to a map taking some point to its future . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we shall enlarge the class of matter for which the result applies by taking another approach , which in effect reduces the problem to the static case . </S>",
    "<S> the method of section 3 is related to the arguments of @xcite .    in the spherically symmetric context , the above two sections generalize in particular results of @xcite and @xcite , and section 2 , where it applies , provides a new and easier approach for the static case . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , no assumption of invariance of the matter with respect to the isometry is necessary , nor is any real understanding of the behavior of the isometry on the event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the results apply equally well when the `` periodic '' assumption is weakened to an appropriate notion of `` almost periodicity '' . </S>",
    "<S> key to the results are the monotonicity properties of the area radius or the hawking mass .    in section 4 , which is independent of sections 2 and 3 , we shall show that dirac fields preserved by an isometry of the form described above must vanish . </S>",
    "<S> the method exploits conservation of the dirac current . </S>",
    "<S> there has a been a series of recent work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where _ static _ spherically symmetric solutions of various coupled einstein - dirac - matter systems are considered , and also work @xcite where periodic solutions of the dirac equation on a _ fixed _ reissner - nordstrm background are considered . </S>",
    "<S> modulo differences in regularity assumptions , all this previous work follows as a special case of the result of this section , which furthermore excludes non - trivial _ periodic _ solutions to a large class of _ coupled _ einstein - dirac - matter systems .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the results of this paper suffer from some of the deficiencies of the original `` no hair '' theorems </S>",
    "<S> . a critical discussion of various geometric and regularity assumptions that appear here , and a comparison to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , is included in the end ( section 4 ) . </S>"
