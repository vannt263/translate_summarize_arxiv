    "the vast majority of current methods for numerically solving quantum many body systems fall into a few broad categories .",
    "one type of approach involves producing approximate representations of wavefunctions .",
    "examples of this approach include configuration interaction , coupled cluster methods@xcite , and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite . a second type of approach is based on perturbation theory .",
    "some versions of perturbation theory are closely related to wavefunction approaches , while others , for example utilizing finite temperature imaginary time green s functions , are more closely related to path integrals .",
    "a third type of approach is quantum monte carlo , which also may involve representations of wavefunctions ( e.g. green s function monte carlo ) or of path integrals ( e.g. determinantal / auxiliary field methods ) .",
    "much less explored than these approaches are methods based on similarity or unitary transformations of the hamiltonian @xmath0 . in these approaches",
    "the primary focus is on @xmath0 and transformed versions of it ; wavefunctions play a much more minor role . in this paper",
    "we develop such an approach in the context of _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry calculations in a finite basis .",
    "this approach is based on unitary canonical transformations ( cts ) of @xmath0 written in second - quantized operator form .",
    "such transformations have been used in analytical work for very long time@xcite . a well known example in condensed matter physics",
    "is the schrieffer - wolff transformation of the anderson model into the kondo model@xcite ; another is the well known mapping of the hubbard model in the large @xmath1 limit into the @xmath2-@xmath3 model .",
    "often these transformations are performed once , and relate one model system to another , simpler system , with fewer degrees of freedom , in an approximate way . in some cases special cts can produce exact solutions for certain model systems .",
    "recently , substantial progress has been made by the development of continuous unitary transformations , in which a set of differential equations is solved to perform the ct.@xcite this method , which was developed independently by wegner and by glazek and wilson , is known by the names  flow equation method \" @xcite and  similarity renormalization \" @xcite .",
    "a key advantage of this approach is that one does not need to know in advance the transformation operator to be used ; it is determined implicitly by the solution of the differential equations .",
    "another advantage is that once the differential equations are set up , there is no operator algebra to be performed in the course of the numerical solution of the differential equations .",
    "this approach can be performed in a semianalytic context , where typically one is deriving one model from another .",
    "for example , an improved treatment of the schrieffer - wolff transformation of the anderson model has been performed .",
    "@xcite it can also be used to obtain ground state energies and dispersion relations ( i.e. excitation energies ) for infinite lattice systems .",
    "@xcite    here we extend and develop the ct approach in a quantum chemical context .",
    "we first introduce a new version of the ct approach which is closely related to the jacobi method of diagonalizing matrices . in this case , rather than solving a differential equation , one performs a sequence cts , each involving the smallest possible number of operators .",
    "this approach is designed to solve a finite quantum system , namely a molecule or cluster in a standard quantum chemical basis , as an alternative to other standard approaches , such as configuration interaction or coupled cluster methods .",
    "we demonstrate that our method can determine ground states in _ ab initio _ chemical systems with excellent precision , utilizing tests on a water molecule for which exact results are available .",
    "we expect similar performance for low lying excited states .",
    "we then present a version of the  flow equation \" approach for use in the _ ab initio _ context .",
    "utilizing ideas developed in our jacobi method , we present a new version of the differential equations which make their numerical solution particularly efficient .",
    "we demonstrate that this method also works very well for the water molecule .",
    "perhaps the most important aspect of our approaches is the ability to remove both low energy ( i.e. core ) and high energy virtual orbitals from the problem , leaving a system with a small number of  active \" orbitals .",
    "this approach is especially useful for  strongly correlated \" systems , i.e. those with open shells , breaking bonds , etc . , where a single reference approach fails .",
    "in these systems , the strong correlation is generally confined to a relatively small number of orbitals . in wavefunction - based approaches",
    ", it can be awkward and expensive to deal with the strongly correlated part of the problem with a powerful method ( e.g. full diagonalization of the active space ) and the simple high - energy part of the problem with another , simpler method . by working with the hamiltonian directly , one can separate the two parts of the problem simply and efficiently .",
    "first one transforms the whole hamiltonian into a form in which the high and low energy orbitals are either completely unoccupied or complete occupied ( for core orbitals ) .",
    "then these orbitals can be thrown out of the problem completely , leaving a smaller system of partially occupied orbitals which can then be solved with any of a variety of nonperturbative techniques . here",
    "we demonstrate this powerful hybrid approach on a stretched water molecule , solving the smaller systems with dmrg .",
    "another advantage in working with the hamiltonian directly is in obtaining excitations . in transforming the hamiltonian , we make progress in solving for excited states at the same time as we obtain the ground state .",
    "essentially the same approach is used to obtain both ground and excited states .",
    "although we have not performed tests yet for excited states , ct approaches in other contexts have obtained excellent results .",
    "@xcite    we will call the set of methods we present here canonical diagonalization ( cd ) .",
    "the term diagonalization indicates our intent to solve the system fully , rather than just transforming to a simpler model .",
    "the transformations involved are both unitary and canonical ( which is defined in the next section ) ; we choose only the term canonical to emphasize that the method works in the space of second quantized operators .",
    "we further distinguish the jacobi cd method ( jcd ) and the flow equation cd method ( fecd ) .",
    "all cd approaches share the feature that the object that one is manipulating is the second quantized hamiltonian , as a collection of abstract operator terms with specific numerical coefficients .",
    "these approaches seem particularly suited to _",
    "ab initio _ quantum chemistry , which are characterized by a very general quantum hamiltonian , containing almost all possible one and two - electron terms .",
    "the cts generate additional terms involving one , two , three , and more particles .",
    "since general one and two particle terms are already present in the hamiltonian , no extra inconvenience arises from these terms .",
    "three and more particle terms are more inconvenient , but most such terms can be neglected , to an excellent approximation .",
    "cd is size - consistent , and many - particle terms which may be left out involve the simultaneous interaction of three or more ( dressed ) electrons , so that neglecting them is analogous to neglecting connected clusters involving triple and higher excitations in coupled cluster methods .",
    "note that canonical transformations also appear in the theory of the coupled cluster method@xcite , although the method remains largely a wavefunction approach .",
    "note also that although one does not need to write any wavefunctions explicitly , cd in its simpler forms implicitly expresses the ground state using the exponential of an operator acting on a reference state .",
    "further links to coupled cluster methods are made in the discussion section .",
    "cd fits naturally into a renormalization group ( rg ) framework .",
    "first , one can remove ( `` integrate out '' ) higher energy orbitals , one at a time if one wishes , leaving a system where the effects of the removed orbitals are incorporated into an effective hamiltonian for the remaining orbitals .",
    "thus each step resembles a transformation in a typical rg calculation in statistical mechanics , although unlike in that case one can not continue indefinitely and there are no fixed points .",
    "second , even if one is not integrating out orbitals , the transformation of the hamiltonian , like in rg methods , occurs in a sequence of steps , with truncation of higher order terms occuring at each step .",
    "third , the differential",
    " flow \" equation form of cd , in which a time - like variable controls the evolution of the hamiltonian operator towards a more diagonal form , closely matches wilson s original conception of the rg approach@xcite .",
    "cd is a natural complement to dmrg , and this was a principle motivation in developing it .",
    "when applied to quantum chemistry problems , dmrg does very well in describing non - dynamical correlations ( strong correlations associated with partially occupied orbitals ) , but it is inefficient in describing dynamical correlations , since it describes high energy virtual orbitals on the same footing as partially occupied strongly interacting orbitals@xcite .",
    "cd has complementary behavior .",
    "it can be used to remove the nearly unoccupied orbitals , leaving a smaller hamiltonian involving strongly interacting orbitals for dmrg to solve .",
    "we begin with the jacobi cd approach . in the ordinary jacobi method for diagonalizing matrices",
    ", one applies a large number of unitary transformations to a hermitian matrix to bring it into diagonal form@xcite .",
    "a unitary transformation gives a new matrix which has the same eigenvalues as the old . in the jacobi method ,",
    "each unitary transformations consists of a rotation of two rows and columns to zero out a single off - diagonal element @xmath4 .",
    "the part of the unitary transformation matrix @xmath5 corresponding to rows and columns @xmath6 , @xmath7 is @xmath8 the angle @xmath9 which removes the term @xmath4 is given by @xmath10\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and the transformation is applied as @xmath12 any unitary transformation can be written as an exponential of an antihermitian matrix @xmath13@xcite . for real symmetric matrices and operators @xmath0 and for what follows , it suffices to use real antisymmetric matrices and operators @xmath13 . in the jacobi method",
    ", one traverses the matrix repeatedly , rotating away off - diagonal elements , starting with the largest off - diagonal elements for efficiency .    in jacobi cd",
    "we construct unitary transformations to successively remove off - diagonal terms of a second quantized hamiltonian .",
    "we consider a quantum chemical system in a hartree fock basis , with hamiltonian @xmath14 here @xmath15 contains the electron kinetic energy and the coulomb interaction between the electrons and the nuclei , while @xmath16 describes the electron - electron coulomb interaction .",
    "indices such as @xmath6 denote spatial hartree - fock orbitals , and @xmath17 is a spin index . later on",
    "we shall sometimes use @xmath6 to denote a spin - orbital , in which case the context should make the usage self - evident .",
    "we use a computer representation of @xmath0 as a sum of abstract operator terms , each with a coefficient and a product of @xmath18 and @xmath19 operators involving various orbitals . in our program a @xmath18 or @xmath19 operator is described by a single byte , which encodes the orbital index involved , the spin , and whether it is @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "this implementation is thus limited to systems with at most 64 orbitals .",
    "a complete operator term is stored as an array of such bytes plus a floating point coefficient .",
    "we developed a set of c++ routines to take products and commutators of such operators , putting the result in normal ordered form using the anticommutation relations .",
    "having these operations be reasonably efficient is crucial to the method .",
    "this approach , using formal operator terms to describe @xmath0 , rather than specific matrix expressions for terms of various orders , is both simple and general . in the future , in order to implement specific approximations within cd , more efficient code could be produced by deriving and implementing the relevant matrix expressions .",
    "an off - diagonal term which can be rotated away is simply any term which is distinct from its hermitian conjugate .",
    "self - adjoint terms constitute the diagonal elements .",
    "they can always be written as products of density operators @xmath20 .",
    "consider , as a specific example , the term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a numerical coefficient .",
    "let @xmath23 given the proper choice of @xmath9 , the transformation @xmath24 will remove @xmath25 from @xmath0 , introducing other terms instead .",
    "we will consider the choice of @xmath9 momentarily .",
    "these additional terms in general have smaller coefficients than @xmath26 , making @xmath0 more diagonal . if one continued the process indefinitely , one would have a  classical \" hamiltonian where every term was diagonal . in this case",
    "any slater determinant @xmath27 is an eigenstate and all eigenvalues can be read off essentially by inspection . after the particle - hole transformation of the occupied orbitals described below , normally the ground state energy is simply the constant term in @xmath0 .",
    "this unitary transformation is a canonical transformation , in that when applied to the operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the anticommutation relations are preserved , e.g. @xmath28 one can view a ct as a complicated many - particle change of basis . in that sense cd",
    "is similar to the dmrg method , the biggest difference being that dmrg works in a wavefunction basis . in the discussion section ,",
    "we comment more on applying the cts to the @xmath18 operators .    in order to carry out the transformations , it is convenient to use the well - known formula @xmath29",
    "+ \\frac{1}{2!}[a,[a , h ] ] \\nonumber\\\\&+ & \\frac{1}{3!}[a,[a,[a , h ] ] ] + ... \\label{expanda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a commutator between an @xmath30-particle term and an @xmath31-particle term gives up to @xmath32-particle terms .",
    "hence , if @xmath13 is a one particle term , it does not generate any higher order terms .",
    "indeed , rotations by one - particle @xmath13 s correspond to single particle changes of basis .",
    "cd using one - particle @xmath13 s can be used to perform a hartee - fock calculation , if the initial orbitals are not the hf orbitals . to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ expanda ] ) , we generally treat each term in @xmath0 separately . for most terms",
    "@xmath33 the transformation has no effect , since @xmath34 = 0 $ ] . for relevant terms",
    "the expansion can be carried out order by order until all terms of a given order are neglible ( i.e. their coefficients are very small ) . at each order the terms should be put in normal ordered form .",
    "the number of distinct terms generated from a single term @xmath33 is a modest finite number , since a particular @xmath35 or @xmath36 can appear at most once in a term in its normal ordered form .    for several reasons it is convenient to perform a particle hole transformation on the occupied orbitals .",
    "thus we define @xmath37 if orbital @xmath6 is unoccupied in the hf state , and @xmath38 if it is occupied . the @xmath39 s have identical anticommutation relations to the @xmath18 s . after this transformation ,",
    "anticommutation relations are used to put the terms in normal ordered form , putting @xmath39 to the right of @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting anticommutators generate new lower order terms , after which the hf energy appears as a constant term in @xmath0 . in terms of the @xmath39 operators ,",
    "the hf state is the vacuum @xmath41 .",
    "there are no off - diagonal single particle terms such as @xmath42 .",
    "there are terms which appear to violate particle conservation , such as @xmath43 , but which in fact do not in terms of real particles .",
    "as one performs the canonical transformations , the vacuum state approaches the exact ground state .",
    "we now consider the choice of @xmath9 .",
    "an operator term @xmath26 connects an exponentially large number of pairs of states @xmath44,@xmath45 together , @xmath46 .",
    "however , one of these pairs of states can be considered the most important , namely , the one closest to the hf vacuum .",
    "this pair has the fewest number of @xmath40 s operating on @xmath41 which generate states not destroyed by @xmath26 . as a specific example , let @xmath47 .",
    "then the most important pair of states is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     these states simply the left and right states of @xmath26 .",
    "other pairs of states , considered to be less important , have additional @xmath40 s , which do not appear in @xmath26 , applied to both @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "for example , one could take the pair @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "define for a term @xmath26 the left energy @xmath53 and similarly the right energy @xmath54 .",
    "we now choose to use the jacobi formula for @xmath9 to attempt to eliminate the off - diagonal term in the hamiltonian connecting @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , if @xmath22 is the coefficient of @xmath26 , we choose @xmath55 .\\ ] ] this does not eliminate @xmath26 exactly , since the operator @xmath13 connects many different states , not just @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so it is not a @xmath56 transformation , as it would be for a matrix .",
    "nevertheless , we find that this choice generally works well , typically reducing the size of the coefficient of @xmath26 by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "note that the degenerate case @xmath57 is nonsingular , generating an angle of @xmath58 ( either angle can be chosen ) .",
    "such a large transformation angle should be avoided if possible , however , since it generates high order terms in the transformation of @xmath0 .",
    "a more common choice in analytic work using cts is to choose to eliminate @xmath26 to first order in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ expanda ] ) , namely choosing @xmath9 to set the coefficient of @xmath59 in @xmath60 $ ] to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the diagonal part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is closely related to our approach : note that @xmath63 | r \\rangle$ ] is the coefficient of @xmath59 in @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath65 | r \\rangle = ( e_r - e_l ) \\langle l | \\bar v_\\alpha | r \\rangle = e_r - e_l\\ ] ] so that this choice gives @xmath66 .",
    "this agrees with our choice to lowest order , but it is not well behaved if @xmath67 .",
    "one need not eliminate all off - diagonal terms in @xmath0 .",
    "if one is interested in only the ground state , then one needs to eliminate all terms connecting that state to other states . more specifically ,",
    "suppose the initial hf state @xmath68 has substantial overlap with the ground state .",
    "only states which produce a nonzero result when acting on the vacuum need be removed , namely , only terms such as @xmath69 or @xmath70 , and their hermitian conjugates ( as well as similar multiparticle terms ) . since all terms still satisfy particle conservation , in each of the two - particle terms two of the orbital indices @xmath71 must correspond to occupied states , and two to unoccupied orbitals",
    "once all such terms are eliminated , then the state @xmath68 is the ground state , and the ground state energy is the constant term in the hamiltonian .    in all but the smallest systems , some of the terms formed from the cts must be discarded according to some criterion .",
    "the simplest criterion is to neglect all terms involving three or more particles , i.e. six or more @xmath39 operators .",
    "our test calculations on the water molecule suggest that this is a very accurate approach for systems well described by a single reference state .",
    "other possible criteria include keeping all terms whose coefficients are larger than some cutoff ; keeping all one and two particle terms and all three particle terms larger than a cutoff , etc .",
    "more sophisticated criteria are possible also , such as trying to estimate the contribution of each term using pertubation theory , and discarding terms whose contribution is below a cutoff . here , we perform some test calculations according to simple cutoff criteria . in the future ,",
    "we hope the criteria can be optimized .    in order to preserve symmetries , such as spin symmetry",
    ", one can rotate sets of terms which are related by a symmetry transformation in one step .",
    "for example , in what follows , for each term , we check to see if it is distinct from the term coming from flipping all of its spin indices .",
    "if it is distinct , both are rotated together with the same rotation angle . the rotation angle for both is chosen as the angle to rotate one of the terms separately .",
    "this procedure preserves spin symmetry exactly",
    ".    one must decide in which order to go through the terms in performing the cts .",
    "since each ct alters the coefficients of many other other terms in h , it makes sense to start with the largest first .",
    "one approach would be to find the term with the largest magnitude coefficient at each step .",
    "another would be to choose the largest rotation angle .",
    "however , searching for the largest term at each step would be inefficient .",
    "therefore , we have chosen the following method : a cutoff angle is chosen , and all terms with angles greater in magnitude than this cutoff are treated in a sweep through the terms , in a predetermined but arbitrary order .",
    "then , the cutoff angle is reduced by a constant factor , and the procedure is repeated . here , we started with a cutoff of 0.15 and reduced it using a factor of 0.6 .",
    "( in some passes , particularly the initial one , there may be no cts performed . ) in table i we show results for a 25 orbital dzp basis water molecule , for which full ci results are available@xcite . because of some arbitrary choices in the ordering of the cts , which unfortunately can affect the results slightly , the results here would be difficult to reproduce precisely by an independently written program .",
    "( the differential equation method discussed below does not suffer this problem . ) despite this , one can easily evaluate the potential of the method from our results .",
    "one can see that we obtain an accuracy of several millihartrees even when truncating all three or more particle terms .",
    "if one keeps also some three particle terms , one can obtain accuracy to fractions of a millihartree .",

    "there are three sources of error in these calculations .",
    "first is the dmrg error , typically near @xmath78 mh , keeping 400 - 600 states , which is small enough to show the other sources of error .",
    "second is the error from performing cd keeping only one and two particle terms .",
    "this is given by @xmath79 .",
    "increasing @xmath39 , or removing fewer orbitals improves @xmath79 .",
    "third , there is the energy from throwing away the removed orbitals after cd .",
    "this is measured by the difference between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and also by the maximum occupancy of the removed orbitals @xmath82 .",
    "we find that @xmath39 can be made quite large : @xmath83 is always fine , whereas @xmath84 can be too large .",
    "we also find that we can remove up to about one half of the orbitals and incur only a very small error , even only keeping one and two particle terms .",
    "for the resulting small system even full ci would be a very easy calculation . even removing all but four of the orbitals we get a reasonable result .",
    "we have not carried out any similar calculations keeping many - particle terms , but we can deduce the probable outcome . since all the rotation angles @xmath9 are rather small in this procedure , four particle terms , which can come in only as @xmath85 , would be neglible .",
    "three particle terms come in as @xmath9 , and if such a term only involved the retained orbitals it presumably would have both @xmath86 and @xmath87 small and it could give a substantial contribution to the energy of order @xmath9 .",
    "three particle terms involving removed orbitals would have @xmath86 or @xmath87 reasonably large , and would only contribute to the energy via second order perturbation terms , thus coming in as @xmath85 , which could be neglected . in short , we expect that keeping three particle terms involving the retained orbitals only would be a very accurate approach for removing more than half of the orbitals .",
    "we would like to conclude this section with an argument that the proper way to separate the treatment of high - energy from low - energy orbitals is by using an effective hamiltonian to remove the high energy orbitals , as we have done , rather than any wavefunction based approach .",
    "we will make this argument via a trivial @xmath88 matrix , designed to have some of the crucial features of a strongly correlated / multireference system .",
    "define the matrix @xmath89 the third row and column represent a high energy orbital , which we would like to treat separately from the first two nearly degenerate rows and columns .",
    "we will consider the parameter values ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) , ( @xmath90 , @xmath92 ) , and ( @xmath93 , @xmath91 ) .",
    "for these three parameters we find the following ground state energies and eigenvectors ( respectively ) : -0.099 , and ( 0.995,-0.0098,-0.098 ) ; -0.064 , and ( 0.789,-0.614,-0.022 ) ; and -0.196 , and ( 0.700,0.700,-0.137 ) . now suppose we wanted to solve this system in two steps , first treating the third `` orbital '' , then next the other two , using a wavefunction approach . in treating the third orbital",
    "we insist that we ignore the small parameter @xmath94 ; otherwise we are treating the whole matrix together .",
    "we imagine that we have some perturbative method for obtaining the third component of the wavefunction , ignoring @xmath94 ; with this fixed , then we obtain the first two components , taking @xmath94 into account .",
    "however , comparing the first and third sets of parameters , we see that the third component @xmath95 depends strongly on @xmath94 , so this method must fail .",
    "alternatively , we might imagine first treating the first two rows and columns separately , ignoring @xmath96 and finding the ratio of components @xmath97 , and then subsequently using @xmath96 to fix @xmath95 . in this case",
    ", comparing the first and second parameter sets , we see that @xmath97 depends strongly on @xmath96 , so that this method fails . in short , to treat this problem successfully , wavefunction based approaches must treat both @xmath96 and @xmath94 simultaneously .",
    "now consider a simple ct approach .",
    "rather than using the jacobi or flow equation method , we use a less sophisticated , but well - known perturbative ct method for removing the third row and column.@xcite in this case , we find that the second - order change in the upper left @xmath56 portion of the matrix , due to the third row and column , is @xmath98 where @xmath11 .",
    "( the general formula is obtained by replacing 3 by @xmath99 and summing over all orbitals to be removed @xmath99 . )",

    "these results compare very nicely to the exact results for the full matrix .",
    "indeed , they must ; the procedure is well controlled , with large energy denominators .    in order to properly separate the two parts of the problem in a wavefunction - based approach",
    ", one needs to allow a set of possible wavefunctions to represent the high energy states , rather than a single part of a wavefunction .",
    "such an approach is embodied in the dmrg method , which chooses the optimal set of states to represent each part of the system .",
    "cd is size - consistent : if one duplicated the hamiltonian for a system , corresponding to having two molecules separated by a large distance , and put in no interaction terms between the two systems , then no interaction terms would ever be generated and each system would behave identically under the cts .",
    "the energy would be double the energy for one system .",
    "the calculation time for cd generally scales identically with the number of orbitals @xmath103 for the jacobi and flow equation methods .",
    "consider first the methods which directly determine the ground state , rather than removing orbitals first .",
    "there are of order @xmath104 terms @xmath45 which connect directly to @xmath68 , where @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) are the number of occupied ( unoccupied ) orbitals , which one needs to remove .",
    "not all other terms @xmath107 connect to any term @xmath45 ; if one is discarding all three particle terms , then there must be two orbital indices matching in @xmath45 and @xmath107 to get a contribution .",

    "hence the total calculation time scales as @xmath109 , or roughly @xmath110 or more roughly @xmath111 .",
    "this is comparable to a singles and doubles ci or coupled cluster .",
    "if one treats only the terms @xmath45 with large angles , using second order perturbation theory for the rest , the calculation time would be reduced but the scaling is more difficult to analyze . however , from the results of fig .",
    "1 it is tempting to estimate the number of terms needed to be rotated as about @xmath108 , leading to an overall scaling of @xmath112 ( plus a time of order @xmath113 for the initial hf change of basis ) . of course , studies of systems of various sizes are necessary to determine the true dependence on @xmath103 .",
    "( it is also challenging to write efficient programs for cd which exploit the potentially favorable scaling : if one is not careful , one may find one s program spending most if its time performing commutators very slowly for terms with small coefficients which are later discarded . )",
    "one could also only rotate the largest @xmath108 terms using the flow equation method , and then use perturbation theory for the rest of the terms , leading to similar scaling with system size .",
    "there are also other variations of cd with good scaling .",
    "note that if one does cd but restricts the terms @xmath107 to be either @xmath114 , or a diagonal term whose indices all match those in @xmath45 , then one obtains an @xmath115 method closely related to second order perturbation theory .",
    "a presumably more accurate @xmath116 method is obtained if one restricts @xmath107 so that three indices must match those in @xmath45 , rather than two . for cd where one removes sets of orbitals , keeping one and two particle terms , the scaling to remove each orbital is @xmath117 , for a total of @xmath110 to remove a finite fraction of the orbitals .",
    "let us discuss in more detail how to think about the canonical transformations@xcite .",
    "thus far , we have taken the view that we apply a ct to get a new hamiltonian @xmath118 which has different coefficients from @xmath0 , but is written in terms of the same operators @xmath119 the new hamiltonian has the same eigenvalues as the old , and one can reconstruct the eigenvectors : if @xmath120 then @xmath121 so that @xmath122 is the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath0 .",
    "one could also define new operators @xmath123 and @xmath124 as @xmath125 where the same expression applies for @xmath124 . since @xmath126 one could equally well write @xmath127 as @xmath128 here @xmath129 is a product of @xmath130 operators with the same orbital indices and order as @xmath131 .",
    "this form , eq .",
    "( [ tilhtilh ] ) , is not especially useful , since the coefficients of the hamiltonian are not any more diagonal than in @xmath0 .",
    "a more useful expression comes from writing @xmath132 if we define new operators @xmath133 using the inverse ct , @xmath134 then @xmath135 where @xmath136 is defined analogously to @xmath129 .",
    "we see that in terms of the @xmath133 operators , the original hamiltonian has the more diagonal form for the coefficients of @xmath127 .",
    "this means that one should think of @xmath137 as the operator which creates a quasiparticle , not @xmath138 . in particular , suppose @xmath13 fully diagonalizes @xmath0 , in which case any slater determinant is an eigenstate of @xmath127 . for any orbital @xmath6 @xmath139 from which we obtain @xmath140",
    "we see that @xmath137 creates a new exact eigenstate from the ground state @xmath141 , containing an extra particle associated with orbital @xmath6 .",
    "this defines @xmath137 to be a quasiparticle creation operator .",
    "it creates a `` dressed '' electron , with correlations built in . because of the correlations built in , three and more particle terms can appear in @xmath127 .",
    "note that if one has exactly diagonalized @xmath0 with @xmath13 , then one can create _ all _ of the excited states by successively applying @xmath137 s to @xmath141 .",
    "the formulation of cd in terms of exponentials of operators has much in common with coupled cluster methods ( cc ) . in coupled cluster methods ,",
    "the ground state wavefunction is written as @xmath142 .",
    "usually @xmath143 is not antihermitian , but in some less common versions of cc , it is , and usually the cc equations are derived using ( formally ) a similarity transformation of h.@xcite one difference between the two is that in cd we never explicitly write down @xmath13 ; rather , we perform a sequence of transformations @xmath144 , which implicitly define the complete transformation @xmath145 .",
    "( in the flow equation method this sequence is continuous . )",
    "based on the similar expressions for the ground state , one might expect cd and cc to have similar errors , and our results are generally consistent with this .",
    "however , the overall point of view between cd and cc is fundamentally different : cc is approximating the ground state , whereas cd is progressively transforming the hamiltonian into a diagonal form .",
    "the point of view of cd makes certain approaches natural and manageable , including removing sets of orbitals , extracting excited states , and utilizing renormalization group ideas .",
    "furthermore , cd , in its various approximate forms , makes its truncations of @xmath0 at each transformation .",
    "these intermediate truncations make tractable the use of unitary transformations , rather than non - unitary similarity transformations .",
    "such continuous truncations are familiar from rg methods in statistical mechanics .",
    "one way of understanding their usefulness is to consider diagonalizing a matrix with an approximate second order unitary transformation , as in the previous section . here , however , we consider transforming the whole matrix this way . except for matrices which are nearly diagonal to start with ,",
    "this second order approach would work very poorly .",
    "however , if one makes a sequence of second - order unitary transformations , each having very small rotation angles , the method becomes accurate ; in fact , it is exact in the continuous limit .",
    "this is analogous to integrating an ordinary differential equation very precisely with a sequence of very small time steps , using a low order integration method .",
    "this is also why the flow equation cd method , without truncation , is exact even though only a first order commutator appears in the equation .",
    "the truncation of many particle terms is not really analogous to throwing away higher order commutators , and so cd with truncation is not exact .",
    "however , there is no reason _ a priori _ to expect that cd , with its continous truncations , should be worse than cc .",
    "now let us briefly mention how to obtain excited states .",
    "suppose one wants to know the energy of an excited state which has a large overlap with the state @xmath146 .",
    "one needs to remove all off - diagonal terms which do not destroy this state , such as @xmath147 , plus their hermitian conjugates .",
    "this includes terms such as @xmath148 , which one would already remove to get the ground state .",
    "it may happen that some of these new terms to remove would require large rotation angles , in which case one might want to remove most of the orbitals first .",
    "note that if one removes a large number of orbitals , a full diagonalization obtaining all excited states of the remaining orbitals may be quite manageable .",
    "one might also try to remove _ all _ off - diagonal terms in @xmath0 , in which case _ all _ the excited state energies could be obtained by inspection !",
    "note that the work for removing all off - diagonal terms in @xmath0 would still scale as @xmath111 .",
    "however , in this case , there would be many terms with nearly degenerate @xmath87 and @xmath86 which would cause problems .",
    "we leave exploration of these approaches for future work .",
    "let us also briefly mention calculation of expectation values of operators in the ground state , @xmath149 .",
    "one approach is simply to apply the same cts to @xmath13 as one has applied to @xmath0 , truncating many - particle terms in a similar fashion , to get @xmath150 , and then evaluate @xmath151 .",
    "another approach would be to obtain an approximate expression for the ground state @xmath152 in the original hf basis , by applying @xmath5 successively to @xmath68 for each ct in reverse order , again with some truncation rules .",
    "again , we leave exploration of these approaches for future work .",
    "we have outlined a numerical approach , canonical diagonalization , for treating a variety of quantum many body problems .",
    "cd is quite different from most existing methods for treating such problems : it does not utilize approximate wavefunctions , semiclassical approximations , path integrals , perturbation theory , or monte carlo . instead",
    ", the second quantized hamiltonian is transformed directly , using canonical transformations , to put it into a diagonal form .",
    "we have demonstrated cd on _ ab initio _ quantum chemical calculations for a small molecule .",
    "cd appears to be quite competitive with the best alternative quantum chemical methods , such as the coupled cluster method , even in this early stage of its development . unlike many other approaches",
    ", cd can be used to treat systems where the ground state has a small overlap with the hartree fock state .",
    "it can also be used to remove high energy orbitals from the problem , leaving a smaller problem which can be treated with other methods , such as dmrg . although we have not yet tested the ability of cd to obtain excited states ,",
    "there is no fundamental difference between the ground state and an excited state within cd , and we have outlined specific methods to obtain excited states .",
    "one of the principle future uses of cd could be to derive simple model hamiltonians , much studied in condensed matter physics , directly from _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "currently , deriving model hamiltonians is an art which involves educated guesses for the proper model forms coupled with the matching of completely separate solutions for the _ ab initio _ and model systems .",
    "cd may be able to unify this approach into a controlled single procedure .",
    "we would like to acknowledge valuable discussions alex maradudin , f. wegner , and a. mielke .",
    "we particularly thank garnet kin - lic chan for a numerous comments and discussions .",
    "we acknowledge the support of the nsf under grant dmr98 - 70930 ."
