    "with the advent of gauge - gravity duality , the study of classical fields in non - trivial gravitational spacetimes , and in particular in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space , has received an incredible amount of attention .",
    "it is then natural to ask , what are the effects of quantum fluctuations around the classical gravitational saddle point ?",
    "one obvious question along these lines is to consider the semi - classical calculation of the quantum gravity partition function , the study of which has a long history @xcite . in the context of gauge - gravity duality ,",
    "the gravity partition function in asymptotically ads spacetimes is equated with the partition function of a strongly coupled conformal field theory ( cft ) in the  large-@xmath0 \" limit .",
    "one - loop contributions to the quantum gravity partition function then correspond to @xmath1 corrections to the partition function of the boundary field theory .",
    "refers to the rank of an @xmath2 supersymmetric @xmath3 gauge theory , and the leading `` @xmath4 '' correction scales as @xmath5 .",
    "there are known stringy corrections of order @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the t hooft coupling ) @xcite in addition to @xmath8 one - loop gravity corrections that are the type of correction explored in the current paper . ]",
    "a particularly interesting application of gauge - gravity duality is in the study of strongly coupled large-@xmath0 gauge theories at finite temperature . in the duality",
    "such systems are described by an asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black hole .",
    "one - loop corrections in such a black hole background then give a window into finite-@xmath0 corrections to thermodynamic and transport properties of the gauge theory plasma .",
    "such finite-@xmath0 corrections are of interest as there are phenomena in the field theory which simply can not be seen in the strict large-@xmath0 limit . for example , hydrodynamic long - time tails are not visible in classical gravity at infinite-@xmath0 @xcite but manifest as a one - loop correction in the bulk @xcite .",
    "other interesting examples include quantum oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite , restoration of the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem @xcite , non - fermi liquid response @xcite and quantum electron stars @xcite .",
    "the computation of one - loop partition functions in black hole spacetimes is notoriously difficult . in @xcite ,",
    "denef , hartnoll and sachdev ( dhs ) gave a beautiful expression for the one - loop determinant of a bulk field .",
    "the result of @xcite expresses the one - loop determinant as a very explicit function in terms of a sum of the quasinormal frequencies of the bulk fluctuation .",
    "this function uniquely specifies the temperature dependence of the one - loop determinant , up to a set of ultra - violet ( uv ) local terms that can be computed in an asymptotic expansion .",
    "@xcite provides several examples where the quasinormal mode spectrum can be computed analytically and then used to compare their formula with known results in simple cases ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one drawback of applying the method of @xcite is that for most black hole spacetimes one does not have an analytic expression for the quasinormal mode spectrum .",
    "instead one typically computes the spectrum numerically .",
    "this poses a difficulty if one would like to compute the one - loop determinant using the results of @xcite .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that the quasinormal mode sum which computes the determinant is uv divergent . in practice",
    ", these uv divergences manifest themselves in two ways .",
    "the quasinormal mode spectrum depends on two types of quantum numbers .",
    "the first labels the momentum transverse to the radial direction of the black hole . and the second is a quantum number associated with the radial direction , which in the euclidean ads black hole is the normal mode number associated with requiring normalizable conditions at the asymptotic boundary .",
    "uv divergences of the one - loop determinant occur when either of these quantum numbers becomes large .",
    "a consistent and pragmatic method of regularizing these divergences is the main goal of this paper .",
    "our goal is to extend the formalism of @xcite to include spacetimes for which the quasinormal mode spectrum is not known analytically .",
    "we will describe a method which uses asymptotic wkb expressions of the quasinormal frequencies to effectively regulate the large radial momentum divergences . for the large transverse momentum divergence",
    ", we develop a new heat kernel expansion which is valid for both fixed and asymptotically - large transverse momenta .",
    "this expansion , together with the details of organizing the calculation of the one - loop determinant to separate analytically - computable divergences from finite contributions ( which may be computed numerically ) , are the primary technical contributions of this paper . as such",
    ", many results of the derivation of the heat kernel ( although tedious ) are included in appendix [ app : hk ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with some preliminaries in section [ sec : prelim ] to introduce notation . in section [ sec : oneloop ] we briefly recap the results of @xcite and outline our numerical procedure for computing the determinant .",
    "section [ sec : regfixedk ] is devoted to understanding the uv asymptotics of one - loop determinants at fixed values of quantum numbers such as the momentum along the spatial boundary directions . in section [ sec : btz ]",
    "we provide an explicit numerical calculation of the one - loop determinant in the three dimensional btz black hole .",
    "comparison of our result with known analytic results in this case provides a modest proof of principle of our numerical procedure of computing one - loop determinants .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : disc ] we conclude with a discussion of future directions and potential caveats of applying our prescription in more complicated scenarios .",
    "in order to set up our discussion of one - loop determinants we first set conventions and detail the types of background geometry and fluctuations that we will analyze . we will study asymptotically - ads black holes / branes .",
    "our primary example is the ads schwarzschild black hole ) with @xmath9 and @xmath10 replaced by the ( normalized ) flat metric @xmath11 . ] with metric given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath10 is the metric on @xmath14 we refer to the space transverse to the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane as the transverse space",
    ". we will be interested in one - loop corrections to the euclidean partition function at temperature @xmath17 .",
    "it is natural to wick rotate to periodic time as @xmath18 where @xmath19 has period given by the inverse temperature , so that @xmath20    the principal example in this paper will be scalar fluctuations about this background .",
    "the laplacian acting on a scalar @xmath21 is @xmath22\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a massive scalar will then satisfy the equation of motion @xmath23 in the context of holography , for asymptotically ads@xmath24 spacetimes the mass @xmath25 is related to the conformal dimension @xmath26 of dual operators . for scalar operators",
    "this relation is simply @xmath27",
    "in this section we present a method to compute one - loop determinants for fluctuations about static spacetimes and , in particular , about asymptotically - ads black holes and black branes",
    ". we will begin with an overview of the results in @xcite , which provide a method of computing determinants using the quasinormal mode fluctuations about the background geometry .",
    "we will then describe a proposal for extending these results to examples in which the quasinormal modes are only known numerically . in particular , for the cases of interest , the one - loop determinant can be separated into contributions from fixed - momentum sectors .",
    "the main obstacle in applying the formalism of @xcite in such situations is that each fixed - momentum determinant is divergent and , furthermore , the subsequent sum over momenta is also divergent .",
    "we will see that the first of these divergences can be handled by an appropriate wkb analysis of the quasinormal modes at fixed momentum @xmath28 , while the second divergence will be addressed later , in section [ sec : regfixedk ] .      to begin ,",
    "let us discuss the dhs formalism @xcite . in asymptotically ads spacetimes ,",
    "the quasinormal mode spectrum of fluctuations provides a natural basis for linearized perturbations about a background spacetime . from the holographic point of view , the quasinormal modes determine the poles of the retarded greens function of the operator dual to the field in question . in this sense ,",
    "the quasinormal modes provide the closest thing to quasi - particle - like excitations in the strongly coupled dual field theory .",
    "the key insight of dhs @xcite is to realize that the quasinormal mode spectrum of an operator also determines the poles of the corresponding one - loop determinant .",
    "this can be seen by treating the partition function of an operator as a meromorphic function of its conformal dimension , @xmath29 which ( for scalar fields ) is related to the mass of the perturbation by @xmath30 .",
    "the poles of the one - loop determinant correspond to zero modes of the differential operator in euclidean signature .",
    "normalizability of a zero mode near the boundary ( @xmath31 ) fixes the behavior of the solution in terms of @xmath32 matching this behavior with regularity of the zero modes at the origin of the euclidean black hole then relates the values of @xmath26 to the thermal frequencies @xmath33 for integral @xmath34 .",
    "when this relation is wick rotated back to lorentzian signature it becomes identical to the condition for the existence of a quasinormal mode .",
    "therefore , as a complex function of @xmath26 , the poles of the partition function will occur precisely when @xmath26 is such that a quasinormal mode ( as a function of @xmath26 ) coincides with a wick rotated thermal frequency .",
    "if we denote the quasinormal frequencies by @xmath35 this means that poles of the one - loop determinant occur at complex values of @xmath26 such that @xmath36 as described in @xcite , given a meromorphic function of @xmath26 that has the correct poles one can determine the entire function by taking the limit @xmath37 and matching to an appropriate asymptotic of the function . as long as one can compute the large @xmath26 asymptotics of the determinant , using for example the heat kernel , one can use this procedure to completely determine the one - loop determinant in terms of the quasinormal mode frequencies .    assuming the meromorphicity properties described in the previous paragraph , dhs @xcite proposed the following form for the partition function of a complex scalar field : @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the quasinormal frequencies with ingoing ( outgoing ) boundary conditions at the horizon and @xmath17 is the hawking temperature of the background .",
    "the function @xmath41 is a polynomial of @xmath26 which is to be determined by matching to a large mass ( large @xmath26 ) expansion of the partition function .",
    "the function ( [ eq : dhs ] ) is constructed such that it has poles whenever a quasinormal mode frequency @xmath42 coincides with a wick rotated normal mode frequency @xmath43      in most non - extremal , finite temperature geometries the quasinormal mode spectrum is not analytically known and one has to resort to numerical methods .",
    "one expands the fluctuations in eigenfunctions of the transverse laplacian and numerically determines the quasinormal mode spectrum .",
    "the end result is a spectrum of frequencies at a fixed value of the transverse momentum quantum number . in the case of a flat boundary geometry the transverse fluctuations are plane waves ( for spherical transverse spaces these",
    "are spherical harmonics ) and the state is labeled by the momentum @xmath28 . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to quantities at fixed transverse quantum number as being at fixed @xmath28 , even when referring to non - flat boundary geometries .    in order to compute the one - loop determinant one must sum over the spectrum at fixed @xmath28 , and",
    "then later perform a sum over the momentum eigenvalues @xmath28 .",
    "the sum over the fixed-@xmath28 quasinormal mode spectrum will be divergent .",
    "however , as long as one can determine the large frequency asymptotics ( say in a wkb approximation ) , this divergence can be subtracted to yield a finite sum .    to make this discussion precise ,",
    "factorize the partition function into fixed momentum sectors , writing @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fixed-@xmath28 partition function . equation ( [ eq : dhs ] ) can be written in this form , with @xmath45 given by @xmath46 or equivalently @xmath47.\\ ] ] the only difference with ( [ eq : dhs ] ) is that ( i ) the quasinormal modes in the sum are restricted to the values at fixed @xmath28 and ( ii ) the exponential prefactor now contains a polynomial of @xmath26 with @xmath28-dependent coefficients .",
    "the quasinormal mode sum in ( [ eq : logzk ] ) is divergent , which would be problematic for a numerical calculation .",
    "our general strategy will be to find a good analytic approximation to the _ divergent _ piece of the sum ( which can then be regulated ) and to only use numerics for the convergent piece that remains .",
    "the divergence of ( [ eq : logzk ] ) comes from arbitrarily large quasinormal mode frequencies . for those frequencies ,",
    "one may generically use the wkb expansion ( instead of numerics ) to determine the frequencies . in the wkb expansion ,",
    "the quasinormal mode frequencies are labeled by an integer mode number @xmath48 such that the quasinormal modes have an expansion of the schematic form and @xmath28-dependence of such an expansion for arbitrary spin fields has not been worked out . in addition",
    ", there are known cases , such as fermionic fields in @xmath49 and gauge fields in @xmath50 , where this expansion develops @xmath51 terms which include logarithmic dependence on functions of @xmath28 and @xmath26 @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath52\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a dimension dependent complex constant , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are complex functions of @xmath26 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a positive dimension - dependent number .",
    "for scalar fields in ads - schwarzschild the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are polynomial in @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "in particular for ads - schwarzschild black branes in @xmath49 , one finds the leading terms in the expansion to be @xmath58 for scalar fields ( the case we will focus on ) .",
    "the @xmath59 in ( [ eq : wkbqnm ] ) represents terms with higher negative powers of @xmath34 , which can be systematically determined in this expansion . for scalars in ads - schwarzschild",
    ", the coefficients of such terms will also be polynomial in @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "we should note that for the btz black hole in @xmath60 which is our test case in section [ sec : btz ] , the expansion ( [ eq : wkbqnm ] ) actually terminates such that @xmath55 and the @xmath59s in ( [ eq : wkbqnm ] ) all vanish .",
    "in fact , the exact quasinormal mode frequencies are known for arbitrary spin fields in the btz black hole background . in order to extend our results to higher dimensional black holes",
    "one must compute the expansion ( [ eq : wkbqnm ] ) at least to high enough order in @xmath61 to remove all divergences in the sum over @xmath34 in the fixed-@xmath28 partition function .",
    "this would require employing techniques such as those in @xcite to compute the asymptotic quasinormal spectrum to higher order in perturbation theory .",
    "we hope to return to this in the near future .",
    "once the @xmath62 are known to sufficiently high order in @xmath61 one can compute the divergent terms in ( [ eq : fixedkz ] ) and explicitly subtract them off .",
    "doing so we can define a subtracted sum for the logarithm of the partition function , @xmath63 above , @xmath64 ( qnm for `` quasinormal mode '' ) refers to the original divergent sum in ( [ eq : logzk ] ) without the @xmath65 term ( to which we return shortly ) , @xmath66.\\ ] ] @xmath67 is defined as the asymptotic ( large @xmath34 ) wkb expansion of @xmath68 , _ truncated _ at a finite order that includes all terms that diverge when summed as in ( [ eq : logzkqnm ] ) . the superscript `` sub '' on @xmath69 stands for `` subtracted . ''",
    "the expression ( [ eq : zksub ] ) is , by construction , a finite sum over @xmath34",

    "we call the new polynomial @xmath70 . the log of the full fixed-@xmath28 partition function can then be written @xmath71 we will operate under the assumption that this factorization is possible  in particular that the fixed-@xmath28 partition function satisfies the same analyticity properties as the full partition function , so that @xmath70 can be determined from a local expression in the @xmath15-@xmath19 plane transverse to the spatial boundary directions and can be calculated in the @xmath72 limit .    in the next section",
    "we will describe how one can use a modified heat kernel to determine the ultraviolet ( uv ) large-@xmath26 asymptotics at fixed-@xmath28 in order to determine @xmath70 and , furthermore , how to utilize this heat kernel to regulate the sum over momentum states .",
    "we now move on to the discussion of regularizing the fixed-@xmath28 partition function described in the previous section .",
    "there are two issues with the fixed-@xmath28 partition function as expressed in ( [ eq : fixedkz ] ) , even after subtracting out the large frequency asymptotics as in ( [ eq : zksub ] ) .",
    "first , it is divergent as a product over @xmath73 this requires a method of determining the large-@xmath28 asymptotics of the fixed-@xmath28 partition function and consistently subtracting the divergent contributions to ( [ eq : fixedkz ] ) when summed over all @xmath28 .",
    "second , in order to determine @xmath70 we will need a way of determining the large-@xmath26 asymptotics of the fixed-@xmath28 partition function .",
    "we will find that both of these issues can be taken care of with an appropriate fixed-@xmath28 heat kernel .",
    "the goal of this section is to construct this fixed-@xmath28 heat kernel .      to derive the form of the fixed-@xmath28 heat kernel",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the laplacian as an effective two - dimensional operator , where the @xmath28 dependence is explicitly packaged into a potential term as opposed to arising as a quantum number due to the background geometry .",

    "note that the geometry ( [ eq:2dslice ] ) is just the naive dimensional reduction of the original geometry ( [ eq : adssmetric ] ) .",
    "this represents the effective geometry , along with the potential ( [ eq : u ] ) , that each fixed-@xmath28 mode function probes . here",
    "we use it as a construct so that we can apply standard heat kernel techniques to determine the asymptotics of the fixed-@xmath28 partition function .",
    "we therefore re - interpret the fixed-@xmath28 partition function @xmath45 for a scalar in the ads black hole / brane spacetime as the partition function of a scalar in the two dimensional geometry ( [ eq:2dslice ] ) with the potential ( [ eq : u ] ) .",
    "a very useful method of determining the uv asymptotics of one - loop determinants is to compute the heat kernel associated with the differential operator .",
    "( for a comprehensive review of heat kernel techniques , see @xcite . )",
    "considering a generic two - derivative operator @xmath91 one constructs the heat kernel as the solution @xmath92 of @xmath93 where we take @xmath94 to act on the variable @xmath95 and impose the boundary condition @xmath96    given a solution @xmath97 the logarithm of the one - loop determinant is determined as @xmath98 where `` const '' corresponds to an undetermined overall normalization of the partition function .",
    "it is possible to solve the heat kernel in a small-@xmath99 expansion , which we refer to as the heat kernel expansion .",
    "this is particularly useful in determining the high energy asymptotics of the heat kernel , and hence , also of the partition function .",
    "the heat kernel expansion gives the following expression for @xmath92 in the @xmath100 coincidence limit , aside from appendix [ app : hk ] , in the rest of the paper we will always write expressions in the coincidence limit and will therefore suppress the second index . ]",
    "@xmath101 where the coefficients @xmath102 are local functions of the background geometry constructed out of curvature invariants . taking the operator to be @xmath103 with @xmath104 the scalar laplacian and @xmath105 an arbitrary potential ,",
    "the first several heat kernel coefficients take the universal form @xcite    [ eq : hkacoeff ] @xmath106    the above expansion is sufficient for discussing the uv asymptotics of the partition function for @xmath107 in particular , if the uv contribution to the integral in ( [ eq : detd ] ) is regulated by a strict cut - off @xmath108 then for @xmath109 all divergences in the @xmath110 limit are contained in the terms present above",
    ". these terms also suffice in determining the large mass ( large @xmath26 ) limit of the determinant .",
    "precisely this type of regulator was used in @xcite to determine @xmath41 by matching the large @xmath26 limits of the heat kernel and the logarithm of ( [ eq : dhs ] ) , completely fixing the normalization of the free energy ( up to an overall @xmath26-independent constant ) . for our purposes",
    "we will need a slightly refined version of the heat kernel , as we discuss in the following subsection .    in order to compare and contrast with the discussion we will have in the next subsection , it is worth taking a moment to briefly review why the heat kernel expansion can be used to study the large mass limit . combining ( [ eq : detd ] ) and ( [ eq : hk ] ) formally gives @xmath111 for large enough @xmath112 , the @xmath99 integral is dominated by @xmath113 and so is of order @xmath114 : the expansion in @xmath112 produces an expansion in @xmath115 .      in order to regulate the asymptotics of the fixed-@xmath28 partition function",
    "we will need an expression for the heat kernel which has the correct asymptotic behavior both at large @xmath26 _ and _ large @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , the product ( [ eq : zprod ] ) over @xmath28 sectors gives and @xmath116 forms in ( [ eq : sumk ] ) assume that @xmath117 is normalized with discrete @xmath28 and continuum @xmath28 conventions respectively . in this section , we will treat @xmath118 and @xmath119 interchangeably and leave the normalization implicit .",
    "when we take up the btz black hole in section [ sec : btz ] , @xmath28 will be discrete , and explicit formulas will use the corresponding normalization for @xmath117 . in the appendices , we will occasionally discuss the black brane limit , where @xmath28 is continuous , but we will not bother to be explicit about changes to normalization factors that appear in switching between the discrete and continuum @xmath28 normalizations involving the size @xmath120 of the space of transverse coordinates . ]",
    "@xmath121 since numerics are not well suited to divergent expressions , we will need to be able to subtract out all the contributions to @xmath117 that give divergent contributions to the integral ( or sum ) over @xmath28 .",

    "recall that our strategy for working at fixed @xmath28 is to interpret the problem as a 2-dimensional , the effective dimension is @xmath123 problem ( [ eq:2dlaplace][eq:2dslice ] ) in @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "correspondingly , the generic heat kernel expression ( [ eq : detd ] ) becomes @xmath124 with @xmath125 here and @xmath126 and the @xmath105 in expressions ( [ eq : hkacoeff ] ) for the coefficients corresponding to @xmath127    however , to reproduce the correct behavior at large @xmath28 , it is necessary to modify the standard heat kernel expansion . to see this , note that @xmath105 above contains a term proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath128 in the heat kernel expansion ( [ eq : hkacoeff ] ) contains a term proportional to @xmath129 , which in our application is therefore proportional to @xmath130 .",
    "each subsequent order in the expansion will contain higher and higher powers of @xmath75 , and so the usual heat kernel expansion ( [ eq : hk ] ) breaks down in the large-@xmath28 limit .",
    "fortunately , there is a natural workaround .",
    "consider again the generic heat kernel expansion of an operator of the form @xmath131 .",
    "first note that the terms with bare powers of @xmath105 in the heat kernel expansion ( [ eq : hk][eq : hkacoeff ] ) appear to exponentiate to @xmath132 .",
    "so let us reorganize the heat kernel expansion to include the factor @xmath132 explicitly : @xmath133 with    [ eq : fixedkhkcoeffs1 ] @xmath134    [ where all of the quantities , such as curvature tensors and covariant derivatives , are defined with respect to the two - dimensional geometry ( [ eq:2dslice ] ) ] .",
    "putting the exponential factor @xmath135 explicitly in the heat kernel removes the problematic @xmath129 terms in the heat kernel coefficients @xmath136 and also provides a suppression of the large-@xmath28 sector for each term in the reorganized expansion .",
    "however , there remain terms proportional to derivatives of @xmath105 ( and hence proportional to @xmath75 ) in the new heat kernel coefficients @xmath137 above .",
    "these terms do not appear to exponentiate , and we might worry that they spoil the convergence of the heat kernel expansion at large @xmath28 .",
    "fortunately they do not , but we will see that one must keep more terms of the reorganized heat kernel expansion than one might have expected .    here s the issue . consider the case of large @xmath28 ( for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the exponential factor in ( [ eq : fixedkhkexp ] ) will effectively restrict the @xmath99 integration of ( [ eq : hk2 ] ) to @xmath138 .",
    "there are now two opposing effects as we go to higher and higher orders @xmath112 in the expansion : ( i ) @xmath139 will give us more and more powers of @xmath140 while ( ii ) we may get derivatives of @xmath105 appearing in the associated coefficients @xmath141 , and each such derivative of @xmath105 will give a power of @xmath75 .",
    "as an example , the @xmath142 term ( i.e.  @xmath143 term ) in ( [ eq : fixedkhkexp ] ) has a contribution of order @xmath144 because of the @xmath145 term in ( [ eq : hkb4 ] ) , and this is the same size as the @xmath146 term ( i.e.  @xmath147 term ) in ( [ eq : fixedkhkexp ] ) .",
    "fortunately , we find that the contributions from higher and higher orders in the reorganized expansion do not remain this size : they slowly decrease ( by powers of @xmath140 ) in steps . as an example , consider the case @xmath148 , for which we would like to analytically extract the large @xmath28 dependence down to @xmath149 in order to isolate the divergences in ( [ eq : sumk ] ) .",

    "@xmath497 inserting these relations in ( [ eq : hk57 ] ) and integrating by parts we find @xmath498 there are two things to notice here .",
    "first , if we substitute ( [ eq : h3hk ] ) into the expression on the first line we reproduce precisely the same integral in ( [ eq : intlimitfirst ] ) that computed @xmath499 ( the fixed-@xmath28 partition function in three dimensions ) , up to a factor of @xmath500 as mentioned previously , this additional exponential factor is precisely that required to shift the @xmath501 in ( [ eq : h3hk ] ) to @xmath502 such that @xmath503 appears in the exponential .",
    "this all means that @xmath504 will have the same expression as @xmath499 and will be given by ( [ eq : zkads3 ] ) , except that the @xmath230 in ( [ eq : zkads3 ] ) will be the appropriate expression for five dimensions .",
    "the second thing to notice in ( [ eq : intbyparthk57 ] ) is that a similar relation exists between the @xmath505 integral on the second line of ( [ eq : intbyparthk57 ] ) and the @xmath506 integral on the first line of ( [ eq : hk57 ] ) . similar reasoning , and applying one additional step of recursion , then implies that @xmath507 also has the same form as @xmath508    in the end , we see that the recursion relation between heat kernels in odd - dimensional @xmath462 implies a simple relation between the fixed-@xmath28 partition functions @xmath509 in particular , we have @xmath510 when @xmath395 is odd .    the case when @xmath395 is even can be worked out similarly , and one can verify that @xmath487 is linear in @xmath73 however , evaluating the explicit dependence on @xmath230 is more complicated because in this case the recursion relation should reduce the final result to an expression as an integral of the heat kernel on @xmath511 which is not known to be expressible in terms of elementary functions @xcite .",
    "the sum over momentum modes in equation ( [ eq : btzfixedkhk ] ) can be done analytically using poisson resummation ( see @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "consider first the sum on @xmath28 of the leading term in ( [ eq : btzfixedkhk ] ) , which can be rewritten as @xmath512 to find the partition function we need to integrate this over @xmath99 as in ( [ eq : inthk ] ) .",
    "for @xmath513 the integral is divergent , and so we evaluate that term independently . using a strict uv cutoff @xmath514 , one finds @xmath515 this is precisely the behavior expected for the uv - divergent contribution arising in standard heat kernel regularization .",
    "in particular , substituting @xmath516 , we see that the prefactor is proportional to the btz volume element factor @xmath517    for @xmath518 , the integral on @xmath99 is finite and yields a bessel function .",
    "using the integral representation @xmath519 and performing the sum on @xmath520 we find @xmath521 where we have defined @xmath522 , @xmath252 are poly - logarithms , and in the second line we have used @xmath523 .",
    "finite contributions of this sort will be crucial in comparing with the standard results for the partition function .    a similar analysis for the second term in ( [ eq : btzfixedkhk ] ) can be done .",
    "the only difference is that the integrand contains one additional factor of @xmath99 .",
    "the @xmath513 mode is again divergent .",
    "performing that integral with the same regulator we find @xmath524 which is again the expected uv divergence and local contributions in a heat kernel regularization .",
    "the sum over non - zero @xmath525 in this case gives a representation of @xmath526 performing similar manipulations to the previous case , one finds @xmath527 putting it together , this yields @xmath528 finally , we need expressions for the two sums with factors of @xmath160 in ( [ eq : btzfixedkhk ] ) .",
    "these can be determined from the previous result in a simple manner .",
    "we can generate the @xmath529 terms by simply differentiating the previous result with respect to @xmath530 namely @xmath531 applying these relations to ( [ eq : btzt1 ] ) we find @xmath532 note that many of the poly - logarithms above can be simply expressed in terms of elementary functions . in particular , @xmath533 poly - logarithms are convenient , as they satisfy the simple relation @xmath534    taking the expressions from this section and evaluating @xmath179 by performing the integral over @xmath535 in ( [ eq : inthk ] ) with @xmath249 as in ( [ eq : x ] ) , one can derive the result for @xmath179 quoted in ( [ eq : hksummed ] ) .",
    "interestingly , as we will see below , the @xmath15 dependence of the integral ends up as a total derivative and the final result is easily expressed in terms of temperature dependent poly - logarithms plus a local integral containing the uv divergent terms .",
    "putting together ( [ eq : btzt0l0 ] and ( [ eq : btzt0sum ] ) and integrating we find @xmath536 where @xmath537 and we have replaced @xmath538 in order to write the measure in the first line . in the second line we have used that , for @xmath249 , the final line of ( [ eq : btzt0sum ] ) is a total derivative @xmath539 = -\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\,{\\text{li}}_3\\left(e^{-2\\pi \\hat m r}\\right)\\right)'\\ ] ] and @xmath540    next , using ( [ eq : btzt1 ] ) , ( [ eq : btzt2sum ] ) , and ( [ eq : btzt3sum ] ) we can evaluate the remaining terms in ( [ eq : btzfixedkhk ] ) , @xmath541 ' { { \\nonumber}}\\\\ & = -\\frac{r_h}{24\\pi tl^2}\\,{\\text{li}}_1\\left(e^{-2\\pi \\hat m r_h}\\right ) { { \\nonumber}}\\\\ & = -\\frac{1}{12}\\,{\\text{li}}_1\\left(e^{-4\\pi^2 \\hat mtl^2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath542 and where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath543 in deriving the second line of ( [ eq : btzt1fin ] ) we have used the relation ( [ eq : plog ] ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that with @xmath230 as the mass in the exponential all of the @xmath185 dependence ( as well as all non - vanishing terms in the large mass limit ) sits in the first term in the heat kernel expansion , which was evaluated in ( [ eq : btzt0fin ] ) .",
