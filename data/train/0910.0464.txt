    "a heavy - ion collision provides a unique environment to study particle interactions at a very high temperature and extreme density . among the most important features of the system created in non - central heavy - ion collisions are the strong magnetic field @xmath1 t ( @xmath2 mev@xmath3 )  @xcite , and large orbital angular momentum",
    "@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "together with non - uniform particle density and pressure gradient in the overlap area formed by the colliding nuclei ( depicted by the color region in fig .",

    "this collective effect has been measured at rhic and sps ( super proton synchrotron ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and the strong elliptic and directed flow observed at rhic are key measures which indicate the quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions .    another interesting phenomena predicted to occur in non - central heavy - ion collisions is global polarization and spin alignment @xcite .",
    "it manifests itself in preferential orientation of the spin of produced particles wrt . the system orbital momentum ( perpendicular to the reaction plane as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbmom_magfield ] ) .",
    "this effect has been recently measured by the star collaboration for strange hyperons ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and vector mesons ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , and is experimentally found to be consistent with zero within experimental uncertainties @xcite .    in this presentation i report on results of the star studies of the local strong parity (  ) violation .",
    "experimental evidence for this effect would be an observation of charge separation along the direction of the magnetic field ( preferential emission of the same charged particles in the same direction ) .",
    "this effect is illustrated by `` + '' ( positive ) and ``  '' ( negative ) charge separation in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbmom_magfield ] .",
    "the underlying physics of charge separation originates in the fundamental features of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the modern understanding of the qcd theory is that its vacuum ( gluonic field energy ) is periodic vs. so - called chern - simons number @xmath11 ( related to the topological charge , @xmath12 , as @xmath13 ) @xcite , and there exist localized in space and time solutions ( topological configurations ) which corresponds to the transformation from one local minima to another .",
    "transition between different vacua can be either via tunneling ( instanton ) or go - over - barrier ( sphaleron ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : topolchargetransition ] schematically illustrates these transitions .",
    "@xmath11 , generalized coordinate    quark interaction with either of these topological configurations changes chirality , which is a   and time reversal odd transition .    at the same time",
    "it is experimentally known that   and @xmath14 invariance are ( globally ) preserved in strong interactions .",
    "the evidence comes form neutron electric dipole moment experiments , which put a strong constrains on the possible magnitude of the parity violating parameter @xcite : @xmath15 ( if @xmath16 , then qcd vacuum breaks   and @xmath14 symmetry ) .",
    "it was recently argued by kharzeev _ et .",
    "_  @xcite that in non - central heavy ion collisions ( local ) formation of metastable -odd domains is not forbidden .",
    "such local strong parity violation can be viewed as a combined result of the following physics effects  @xcite :    * external magnetic field aligns quark spins along or opposite to its direction .",
    "right - handed quark momentum becomes opposite to the left - handed one .",
    "* vacuum topological transitions produce a domain with local excess of left or right handed quarks @xmath17 ( what corresponds to non - zero topological charge ) . *",
    "magnetic field induces electric field which is parallel to it : @xmath18 . in this electric field",
    "positive and negative charges start to move opposite to each other , which in a finite volume results in charge separation .    depending on the sign of the domain s topological charge ,",
    "positively charged particles will be preferentially emitted either along , or in the direction opposite to , the system orbital angular momentum , with negative particles flowing oppositely to the positive particles .",
    "charge separation can be described by adding -odd sine terms to the fourier decomposition of the particle azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane angle , @xmath19  @xcite : & & 1 + 2 _ n=1^ v_n ,",
    "n _ + 2 a _ _ , [ eq : expansion ] where @xmath20 is the particle azimuth relative to the reaction plane , @xmath21 are coefficients accounting for the anisotropic flow ( @xmath22 is called directed , and @xmath23 is elliptic flow ) .",
    "the @xmath24 parameters , @xmath25 , describe the -violating effects ( in the present study we consider only the first harmonic ) .    for mid - central collisions at rhic energies ,",
    "predicted value for the @xmath24 parameter is of the order of 1% @xcite , which is too small to be observed in a single event .",
    "the direct , -odd , observable @xmath26 ( average asymmetry over many events ) must also yield zero , and the only way to experimentally probe charge asymmetry is to use multi- ( two or more ) particle correlations , what limits the measurement to -even observables only .",
    "this brings a problem of separating ( or suppressing ) -conserving background physics effects in the measurement .",
    "physics backgrounds can be sorted into two different categories : background which produce correlations independent of the reaction plane orientation and those which are reaction plane dependent . to suppress reaction plane independent backgrounds ,",
    "voloshin proposed to use the following two particle correlator wrt .",
    "the reaction plane  @xcite : & = [ eq : obs1 ] + & = - [ eq : cossin ] + & = [ + b_in ] - [ + b_out ] . [ eq : v - a ] here @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the in- and out - of plane background contributions to the correlator , and @xmath29 denote particle charge .",
    "figure [ fig : charge_sep ] illustrates the relation between various azimuthal angles in the laboratory frame and the reaction plane orientation .     and @xmath30 in the laboratory frame and the reaction plane .",
    "]    the correlator ( [ eq : cossin ] ) represents the difference between correlations projected onto an axis in the reaction plane and the correlations projected onto an axis that is out - of - plane or perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "the key advantage of using a difference equation is that it removes all the background correlations among particles @xmath31 and @xmath30 that are not related to the reaction plane orientation  @xcite .",
    "the first estimates  @xcite of the charge asymmetry predicted a signal of the order of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the topological charge and @xmath34 is the positive pion multiplicity in one unit of rapidity .",
    "more accurate estimates  @xcite were found to be close to the same number , of the order of @xmath35 for mid - central collisions , which corresponds to @xmath36 for the correlator @xmath37 ( third term in eq .",
    "[ eq : v - a ] ) . without in medium effects ,",
    "one expects the symmetry between same- and opposite - sign correlations : @xmath38 , but in case of heavy ion collisions one needs to account for correlation modification due to particle interaction with the medium .",
    "this is similar to the back - to - back suppression of jet - like correlations , and is predicted to result in in suppression of opposite sign correlations  @xcite : @xmath39 .",
    "the correlator @xmath37 should follow ( a typical for any kind of correlations due to clusters ) @xmath40 dependence ( @xmath41 is the charge multiplicity ) .",
    "local parity violation is a non - perturbative effect and the main contribution should come from particles which have transverse momentum smaller than 1  gev/@xmath42  @xcite , with correlation width of the order of one unit in rapidity ( typical size of the -odd domain is about 1  fm ) .",
    "the reaction plane orientation is not known a priori in the experiment , and it needs to be reconstructed from particle azimuthal distributions  @xcite . for that reason instead of measuring the two particle correlator wrt . the reaction plane ( [ eq : obs1 ] ) , we evaluate the three particle correlator , where the third particle , @xmath42 , gives an estimate of the reaction plane . such a three particle correlator can be related to the correlator ( [ eq : obs1 ] ) by the following equation : ( _ a + _ -2 ) = ( _ a + _ -2_c ) / v_2,c .",
    "[ e3p ] here @xmath43 is an elliptic flow value of the third particle @xmath42 , and it accounts for the finite resolution in our estimate of the reaction plane angle @xcite .",
    "equation [ e3p ] assumes that particle @xmath42 is correlated with particles @xmath31 and @xmath30 only via common correlation to the reaction plane .",
    "this third particle further complicates experimental data analysis , since it potentially adds to the measured values of the correlator  ( [ e3p ] ) some background contributions from genuine 3-particle correlations .",
    "these contributions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ physicsbackgrounds ] .",
    "the results presented here are based on 14.7 m au+au and 13.9 m cu+cu collisions at the incident energies = 200  gev , and 2.4 m au+au and 6.3 m cu+cu events at = 62  gev .",
