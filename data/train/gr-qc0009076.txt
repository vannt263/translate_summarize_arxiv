    "the weak energy condition ( wec ) states that @xcite : @xmath0 , for all timelike vectors , where @xmath1 is the stress - energy tensor of matter , and @xmath2 is an arbitrary timelike vector . by continuity",
    ", the condition holds for all null vectors as well .",
    "physically the wec implies that the energy density seen by all observers is non - negative .",
    "all experimentally observed forms of classical matter satisfy this condition .",
    "however , quantum matter fields can violate this and all the other standard energy conditions of general relativity @xcite . in at least some circumstances ,",
    "quantum field theory imposes certain restrictions on the degree of energy condition breakdown , in the form of what have come to be known as `` quantum inequalities '' .",
    "these typically restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy densities and fluxes , and seem to limit the production of gross macroscopic effects .",
    "the quantum inequalities put severe restrictions on the realizability of traversable wormholes and warp drives @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that all classical fields will obey the wec .",
    "this is , however , not always the case .",
    "the energy density for a classical non - minimally coupled scalar field can in fact be negative .",
    "to our knowledge , the associated stress tensor was first written down for the case of conformal coupling by chernikov and tagirov  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of conformal coupling were emphasized by callen , coleman , and jackiw  @xcite for flat spacetime quantum field theory , and further discussed by parker  @xcite in curved spacetime .",
    "bekenstein  @xcite noted that the conformal scalar field can violate the wec and other energy conditions , and took advantage of this property to construct non - singular cosmological models .",
    "the violation of energy conditions by non - minimal scalars was further discussed by many authors , including deser @xcite , flanagan and wald @xcite , and in more detail recently by barcelo and visser @xcite .",
    "these features have enabled barcelo and visser to construct macroscopic wormhole solutions in which non - minimally coupled scalar fields violate the averaged null energy condition and serve as the `` exotic matter '' source required for wormhole maintenance . because such fields are classical , they are not subject to the quantum inequality restrictions on the magnitude and duration of negative energy .",
    "this situation is rather unsettling , since the door is then opened for all sorts of bizarre effects .",
    "one of the most disturbing of these is a potential violation of the second law of thermodynamics by creating fluxes of negative energy .",
    "for example , one might shine such a flux at a hot object and decrease its entropy .",
    "if the radiation field has zero entropy , then the second law will be violated . in the case of negative energy fluxes produced by quantum fields ,",
    "the quantum inequalities appear to prevent such large scale breakdowns of the second law @xcite .",
    "indeed in some cases , such as the hawking evaporation of black holes , negative energy is required for the consistency of the unification of the laws of black hole physics and the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "the generalized second law ( gsl ) states @xcite that the sum of the entropy of a black hole and that of any surrounding matter can never decrease , so @xmath3 where here @xmath4 is taken to be the entropy of the black hole , which is proportional to the area of its event horizon . in the hawking evaporation process , although the area and thus the entropy of the black hole decrease , this is more than compensated for by the entropy of the emitted thermal hawking radiation .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that large , transient negative energy fluxes can be produced quite easily with classical free massless non - minimally coupled scalar fields , even in flat spacetime .",
    "such fluxes appear to have magnitudes large enough to violate the second law for arbitrary lengths of time .",
    "however , due to possible uncertainties of how such fields might interact with ordinary matter , one could conceivably argue that perhaps the second law might still hold . in an attempt to circumvent the latter possibility",
    ", we examine a classical non - minimally coupled scalar field on a black hole background .",
    "we show that although the integrated energy flux injected into the hole is positive , it can be made temporarily negative , and that these periods can be made arbitrarily long .",
    "this raises the possibility that one might be able to achieve temporary but large , and in principle measurable , violations of the gsl .",
    "we give a proof that the gsl is in fact always _ satisfied _ , even though the horizon area of the black hole can temporarily decrease .",
    "a physical understanding of how this happens involves the subtle interplay of two effects - the acausal nature of the horizon and an additional term in the black hole entropy which depends on the scalar field .",
    "two illustrative numerical examples are presented which demonstrate that a consideration of both effects is crucial to the preservation of the gsl .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results and a discussion of open questions .    in this paper , we use the mtw metric signature and sign conventions , and work in units where @xmath5 .",
    "the einstein equations for a generically coupled scalar field can be obtained by varying the einstein ",

    "( [ eq : emt2 ] ) vanishes at least as rapidly . in this paper",
    ", we will make the restriction that @xmath14 everywhere .",
    "the wormhole solutions of barcelo and visser have the feature that @xmath15 can be negative , which implies either super - planckian values for @xmath16 or extremely large values of the coupling parameter @xmath17 .",

    "we can convert to conventional units by recalling that the planck unit of flux is @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the planck mass , planck length and planck time , respectively .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : flatfinst2 ] ) becomes @xmath50 if , for example , we set @xmath51s , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we have a negative energy flux of magnitude @xmath54 which has a duration of the order of a few tenths of a second . by ordinary standards , this is an enormous amount of negative energy , which has the potential to cause dramatic effects .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxfst ] ) shows that the flux can be expressed as a positive quantity plus a total derivative .",
    "this means that if @xmath16 and its first derivative vanish in both the past and the future , then the time - integrated flux is positive .",
    "as the above example illustrates , however , the transient flux can be made negative for an arbitrarily long time .    in order to argue that this flux can be used to achieve a violation of the second law , we need to specify how the scalar field interacts with ordinary matter . it might be argued that if this interaction is sufficiently weak , then second law violations might be avoided . without a detailed model of a system to detect the negative flux , this question may be hard to answer definitively .",
    "our purpose here was to demonstrate that one can already achieve negative energy fluxes of large magnitude , which have the _ possibility _ of violating the second law , even in flat spacetime . in the next section",
    "we turn our attention to a relatively unambiguous energy flux detector - a black hole .      in this section",

    "strictly speaking , @xmath78 at @xmath79 . however , we can get around this problem by taking the effective boundary of the hole to be at @xmath80 .",

    "visser @xcite has referred to these and similar objects as `` dirty '' black holes . for a classical non - minimally coupled scalar field ,",

    "we address the issue of the existence of various conformal frames for scalar field theories .",
    "the form of the action of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlagrangian ] ) is often called the jordan frame .",
    "it is possible to perform a conformal metric transformation and field redefinition which convert the action into a form in which the @xmath107 term is no longer present . to our knowledge , this was first done for the transformation relating a massless conformally coupled and a minimally coupled scalar field by bekenstein @xcite , and later generalized to the case of arbitrary values of the coupling parameter by others .",
    "( see the excellent review article by faraoni , gunzig , and nardone @xcite for details and further references . )",
    "deser  @xcite pointed out that this transformation can remove violations of the wec .",
    "the form of the theory in which @xmath17 is transformed to zero is called the einstein frame .",
    "the use of the word frame to describe these forms of the action is perhaps misleading ; the transformation between the two is _ not a coordinate transformation _ , but rather a field redefinition which mixes the nature of the scalar and gravitational fields .",
    "this field redefinition technique has been extensively used by jacobson , kang , and myers @xcite to study black hole entropy , particularly in the context of higher curvature gravity theories .",
    "one could apply their technique to the massless non - minimally coupled scalar field case as well to argue that if the gsl is preserved in the einstein frame , then it should also be preserved in the jordan frame .",
    "the argument goes as follows @xcite .",
    "each solution in the jordan frame can be mapped , via the field redefinition technique , into a solution in the einstein frame . in particular ,",
    "the black hole entropy for a stationary state , as formulated in the jordan frame , can be transformed to the entropy in the einstein frame .",
    "the latter is just the usual bekenstein - hawking entropy , @xmath87 , which we know is non - decreasing in the einstein frame , provided that any matter absorbed by the hole satisfies the wec .",
    "additionally , a non - minimally coupled scalar field ( which violates the wec ) in the jordan frame is transformed to a minimally coupled scalar field ( which obeys the wec ) in the einstein frame .",
    "now suppose that in the jordan frame the evolution of the black hole proceeds from one stationary state to another via a series of equilibrium states . since each solution representing one of those states can be transformed into a solution in the einstein frame , and since in the einstein frame the entropy is a non - decreasing function , it should also be a non - decreasing function in the jordan frame .",
    "hence , the gsl should be satisfied in both frames .",
    "the question which now arises is whether the jordan frame and the einstein frame are physically equivalent to one another .",
    "this issue has been widely debated in the literature and is reviewed in ref .",
    "there is certainly a formal equivalence ; a solution of the einstein - klein gordon equations in one frame can be mapped to a solution in the other frame .",
    "thus in the jordan frame , one must have a function which is non - decreasing in time obtained by mapping the einstein frame area to the jordan frame .",
    "what is less clear is the physical interpretation that should be attached to this function , or what observers in the jordan frame would actually see if negative energy is absorbed by a black hole .",
    "furthermore , one is often interested in situations where the full theory is not given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlagrangian ] ) alone , but there are additional parts in the action describing other fields . the transformation to the einstein frame would then require transforming these parts as well , potentially leading to a very cumbersome formulation of the theory .    for these reasons , it is desirable to have a proof of the gsl formulated entirely in the jordan frame .",
    "such proofs have been given by jacobson , kang , and myers @xcite for gravity theories with actions that are polynomials in the ricci scalar , and by kang  @xcite for the brans - dicke theory .",
    "their methods would presumably also be applicable to the case of non - minimal scalar fields . in the next subsection",
    ", we will give a somewhat different proof of the gsl for this case .",
    "in this section , we will show that the entropy defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) is a non - decreasing function , even when negative energy is being injected into the black hole . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is the entropy of a stationary black hole .",
    "let us now assume that the expression given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) is the black hole entropy even at each moment during the dynamical evolution of the horizon and examine its behavior .",
    "we assume that @xmath108 outside of a finite interval in @xmath109 , where @xmath109 is an affine parameter on the horizon .",
    "in general , @xmath16 can vary over the horizon , so it is convenient to divide the horizon into @xmath110 patches , where each patch is sufficiently small that there is no spatial variation in @xmath16 through the interval in @xmath109 during which @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath4 can be written as a discrete sum @xmath112 where @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the area of the @xmath115-th patch and @xmath116 is the value of @xmath16 on that patch .",
    "now we consider a particular patch , and drop the @xmath115 subscript .",
    "the logarithmic derivative of @xmath117 with respect to @xmath109 is the expansion , @xmath118 ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 137 ) : @xmath119 thus we can write @xmath120 we will take another derivative of this equation with respect to @xmath109 and use the raychaudhuri equation for the null generators of the horizon : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the tangent vector to a generator , @xmath123 is the shear and @xmath124 the vorticity . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : d2lns ] ) are less than or equal to zero .",
    "hence @xmath131    now we wish to show that @xmath132 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath109 .",
    "first note that @xmath133 is a monotonic function of @xmath132 , so either one being monotonically increasing implies that the other is also monotonically increasing .",
    "we assume that the scalar field vanishes as @xmath134 , so that @xmath135 .",
    "furthermore , at late times @xmath117 approaches a constant value of @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the final horizon area .",
    "thus @xmath138 if @xmath132 were ever to be a decreasing function of @xmath109 , we would have to have @xmath139/{d\\lambda}<\\nobreak 0 $ ] at some finite value of @xmath109 .",
    "however , this is impossible because the only way a twice differentiable function can go from having a negative value of its derivative to a zero value is to pass through a region where the second derivative is positive , which is forbidden by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lns_ineq ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath140 everywhere .",
    "finally , if the entropy contribution of each patch is nondecreasing , it follows that the entire entropy is also a nondecreasing function : @xmath141 this completes the proof of the generalized second law .",
    "note that @xmath10 does not appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tkk ] ) , and hence our proof is independent of any scalar self - coupling .",
    "the proof is not restricted to schwarzschild black holes , and so would also hold for other , e. g. , kerr , black holes as well . here",
    "we also did not need to assume that the changes in the mass of the black hole must be necessarily small .",
    "we point out that although @xmath4 is a non - decreasing function , the same is not necessarily true of the horizon area .",
    "if we take the second derivative of @xmath142 , and use the raychaudhuri equation we can write @xmath143 if @xmath144 , then @xmath145 however , if the wec is violated , so that @xmath146 , then the sign of @xmath147 can be positive , and therefore the argument we made for the non - decrease of @xmath4 does not work for @xmath88 . we assumed that the scalar field vanishes outside of a finite interval in @xmath109 , so we know that the entropy in the distant past is @xmath148 and in the distant future is @xmath149 , where @xmath150 and @xmath137 are the initial and final total horizon areas , respectively . since we proved that @xmath4 is a non - decreasing function , this implies that @xmath151 .",
    "the case @xmath152 corresponds to the trivial case that @xmath153 everywhere , as may be seen from the following argument .",

    "( [ eq : d2lns ] ) must vanish , but the last of these terms can only do so for the trivial , @xmath153 , case .",
    "of course , there is still the possibility of temporary decreases in @xmath88 during the evolution . indeed in the next section , we will exhibit specific examples where @xmath88 can either increase or temporarily decrease , while @xmath4 is always non - decreasing .",
    "note that the fact that @xmath155 is a generalization of our result in the previous section .",

    "this counter - intuitive behavior of the horizon is discussed in more detail in the appendix . in the second example , the periods of negative energy flux last long enough that this precognition effect can not keep the horizon area from decreasing periodically , although the integrated area change is positive .",

    "the plotted rescaled quantities are : @xmath232 , and @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the final entropy in our units . in this case",
    "there are three negative energy pulses embedded in the overall flux , but the duration of each pulse is short enough that the negative and positive parts of the flux occur close together in time .",
    "the acausal expansion of the horizon , in anticipation of the ( larger ) positive parts of the flux , is enough to save the gsl in this case .",
    "it is very important to take this effect into account in the analysis of the dynamical case . for a static black hole ,",
    "the area of the horizon is simply @xmath235 .",
    "this is also the area of the apparent horizon in the dynamical case .",
    "if one naively adopts this form for the area during the dynamical phase ( as we mistakenly did in an earlier analysis of this problem @xcite ) , then even taking into account the change in the mass , one can still find cases where the gsl appears to be violated .    case ( ii )",

    "the plotted rescaled quantities are : @xmath239 , and @xmath240 .",
    "there are again three negative energy pulses .",
    "however , in this case , each pulse lasts sufficiently long enough that the acausal behavior of the horizon is _ not _ sufficient to rescue the gsl , as evidenced by the three periodic decreases of the horizon area .",
    "that is , if the entropy were simply given by @xmath87 , as in the usual case , then the gsl would be violated during the periods of area decrease .",
    "what prevents this from occurring in this case is the influence of the scalar field term in the formula for the black hole entropy .",
    "note also the phase lag between the change of sign of the flux and the onset of area decrease or increase .",
    "the scaling factors used in the two figures are different .",
    "the values of the scalar field on the horizon are approximately the same in both cases , and hence the magnitude of the fractional difference between @xmath4 and @xmath88 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "however , the magnitude of the flux is smaller in fig .  2 than in fig .  1 , because of the slower rate of change of @xmath16 .",
    "we have demonstrated that classical massless non - minimally coupled scalar fields can be used to produce disturbingly large negative energy fluxes , even in flat spacetime .",
    "these classical negative energy fluxes are temporary in the sense that the time - integrated flux is always positive . however , unlike the situation in quantum theory , there are no constraints here analogous to the quantum inequalities .",
    "therefore , it is possible for such fluxes to be sustained over macroscopically long time intervals . these fluxes appear to have magnitudes sufficient to produce gross violations of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "however , whether such violations occur could depend on the details of how these fields interact with matter .",
    "in an attempt to circumvent this issue , we examined these negative energy fluxes in the presence of a relatively unambiguous energy detector , a black hole .",
    "we considered scenarios in which a negative energy flux , composed of classical non - minimally coupled scalar fields , is injected into the black hole .",
    "it was proved that the gsl is in fact always _",
    "satisfied_. this conclusion is true for any positive or negative value of the coupling parameter , subject to the condition that @xmath241 , and is independent of the scalar potential @xmath10 . the proof is also not restricted to schwarzschild black holes , and therefore will hold for rotating black holes as well .",
    "the validity of the gsl hinges on two key effects - the acausal behavior of the event horizon and the presence of an additional term in the formula for the black hole entropy which depends on the scalar field .    in the dynamical case",
    ", the area of the event horizon , in contrast to that of the apparent horizon , depends upon the future history of the spacetime .",
    "this behavior is reviewed and illustrated in the appendix . for a schwarzschild black hole , when the temporal separation of the negative and positive energy pulses is no more than several times @xmath68 , as was the case in fig .  1",
    ", this effect alone can be sufficient to preserve the gsl . here",
    "the horizon moves outward in anticipation of the ( larger ) positive energy in such a way that @xmath88 is non - decreasing .",
    "if , however , the temporal separation becomes long compared to @xmath68 , this effect is no longer sufficient to prevent @xmath88 from decreasing .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "a similar result was found in the case of brans - dicke theory in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the @xmath16-dependence of @xmath4 is crucial for insuring that the entropy is non - decreasing .",
    "note that this @xmath16-dependence is also not always sufficient by itself to save the gsl without the acausal behavior of the horizon .",
    "for example , the product of the area of the apparent horizon times @xmath242 can decrease .",
    "there are still some questions left unanswered at this point .",
    "one is whether negative energy could actually destroy a black hole . our treatment in sect .",
    "[ sec : proof ] and those in refs .",
    "@xcite have assumed either a final black hole or cosmic censorship , and hence do not rule out this possibility .",
    "another question is whether one could violate the gsl if @xmath242 is not positive everywhere ; this situation would involve either super - planckian values of the scalar field or very large values of the coupling parameter .",
    "it might also result in a sign change of the effective local newton s constant , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : geff ] ) , and non - positivity of the entropy density . recall that this condition played a crucial role at several steps . we assumed it in our proof of the gsl , and",
    "it is also needed to define the transformations from the jordan to the einstein frame , and hence to make the argument that the area in the einstein frame provides a suitable non - decreasing quantity .",
    "it may also be necessary for the initial value problem to be well - posed  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath243 , then one would expect the effective stress tensor to become singular .",
    "this should lead to a backreaction effect which will prevent the system from actually reaching @xmath244 ; such an effect was indeed found in the case of cosmological spacetimes in ref .",
    "however , @xmath1 can remain finite if the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emt2 ] ) vanishes at the same points that @xmath243 .",
    "this is what happens in some of the solutions of barcelo and visser  @xcite . whether one could similarly construct examples which violate the gsl when @xmath245 remains unknown , although we strongly suspect so",
    "nonetheless , it is quite interesting that , even for relatively weak fields and coupling constants : ( a ) one can get large sustainable , albeit temporary , classical negative energy fluxes , and ( b ) that such fluxes do not violate the gsl .    the acausal nature of the area of the event horizon is a disturbing feature of the current formulation of black hole thermodynamics , and one which has drawn the attention of various authors  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether this feature will survive in future theories .",
    "a definition of entropy based on a statistical mechanical enumeration of states would seem to have to be causal .",
    "this is a deep question which may have to await a more complete quantum theory of gravity for a resolution .",
    "finally , there is the question of whether the large negative energy associated with a classical scalar field could produce any dramatic effects , such as violations of the second law for an ordinary thermodynamic system .",
    "more generally , does this negative energy produce any observable effect on ordinary matter ?",
    "it would seem rather peculiar if one could violate the ordinary second law but not the gsl .",
    "one would suspect that they should either both hold or both be violated . however at present we do not know of a similar general argument that would guarantee that the ordinary second law is not violated .",
    "if such classical scalar fields can exist , that raises the question of why only certain classical fields are capable of producing large energy condition violations .",
    "for example , it is often thought that the conformally coupled scalar field is `` physically reasonable '' because it faithfully mimics certain aspects of the electromagnetic field .",
    "but why then does the classical electromagnetic field obey the wec , while the conformally coupled scalar field does not ?",
    "it is usually easier to get negative energy in the context of quantum rather than classical fields .",
    "moreover , in the regime of quantum fields , there seem to be some rather strong restrictions imposed on the magnitude and extent of negative energy densities and fluxes , in the form of the quantum inequalities .",
    "given that nature seems to tightly restrict quantum violations of the weak energy condition , how seriously should one take classical violations ?",
    "these are all issues for further enquiry .",

    "let us first solve the raychaudhuri equation without the @xmath170-function term : @xmath252 this equation has the simple solution @xmath253 after the absorption of the pulse the generators of the horizon have zero expansion , so we want @xmath168 for @xmath254 , so let @xmath255 i. e. , @xmath118 jumps discontinuously from @xmath256 to @xmath257 as @xmath109 passes through @xmath257 .",
