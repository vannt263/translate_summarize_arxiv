    "probably one of the most well known and understood ionic materials is sodium chloride ( nacl ) . in its _ solid _ form ( i.e. , nacl cubic - like crystalline lattice ) , the experimentally measured heat of vaporization ( 7.92 ev ) can be deduced ( within about @xmath0 ) from a straightforward lattice sum of the form @xmath1 leading to the theoretical madelung energy ( here @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "this striking good agreement demonstrates that electrostatics is indeed the relevant ingredient governing our ionic crystal @xcite . in its _ liquid _ form",
    ", nacl plays a fundamental role in soft matter , since it controls the degree of screening of the coulomb interaction in all water based solutions .",
    "it is exactly this type of problem that this review will address : electrostatics in soft matter .",
    "virtually all materials are more or less charged at the mesoscopic scale , depending on the degree of the polarizability of the embedding solvent ( or matrix ) and the solute particles ( e. g. , colloidal particles , polymers , membranes . etc . ) .",
    "the most well known example of polar solvent is evidently water which plays a crucial role in life , biological processes as well as industrial applications . when the solute particles are polar too , they can then dissociate into charged particles ( also called _ macroions _ ) and ( _ microscopic _ ) counterions .",
    "the counterion distribution near macroions turns out to be decisive for the surface properties of the latter .",
    "the pioneering works of gouy and chapman @xcite , realized almost one century ago , concern the counterion distribution near a planar charged interface .",
    "applying the presently called poisson - boltzmann theory , they demonstrated that the counterion distribution profile decays algebraically as a function of the separation from the wall with a characteristic length that is inversely proportional to the surface charge density of the wall .",
    "ten years later , debye and hckel @xcite accomplished a fundamental advance towards the understanding of screening .",
    "this theory originally developed for electrolytes ( i.e. a solution of microscopic cations and anions such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and based on the linearization of the poisson - boltzmann equation is now widely used in plasma and solid state physics .",
    "mean - field theories are appealing tools due to their intuitive and clear physical basis , and are robust theories as long as",
    "_ electrostatic correlations _ are not too important . in many practical situations ( chromatin , polyelectrolyte multilayering , charged colloidal suspension , etc . )",
    "electrostatic correlations are strong enough to make mean - field theories fail even on a qualitative level .",
    "two striking and natural consequences of electrostatic correlations , that can not be explained by mean - field theories , are charge reversal ( also called overcharging ) and like charge attraction : ( i ) overcharging concerns the situation where a macroion is locally covered by a cloud of counterions whose global charge overcompensates that of the macroion so that the net charge ( or effective charge ) changes sign ; ( ii ) like charge attraction is the counterintuitive effective attraction between two macroions carrying the same electric charge sign .    a colloidal suspension , the classical material of soft matter science , can crystallize via a strong enough mutual electrostatic repulsion .",
    "an understanding of the resulting phase behavior necessitates approaches where particle - particle correlations must obviously be taken into account .",
    "this constitutes another example where approaches going beyond the mean - field level are required .",
    "the present work examines the problem of electrostatics in soft matter systems using simple theoretical models and computer simulations .",
    "the role of the little counterions is addressed in chapter [ cha : oc ] .",
    "the relevance of excluded volume ( i.e. the finite hard - core size of the constitutive ions ) is discussed in chapter [ cha : ex_vol ] .",
    "the problem of image charges as occurring near curved dielectric interfaces is presented in chapter [ cha : image ] .",
    "the basic physics in more complex processes such as polyelectrolyte adsorption and multilayering is elucidated in chapter [ cha : pe ] .",
    "colloidal dispersions in strong confinement are presented in chapter [ cha:2d ] .",
    "finally , a conclusion and possible outlooks are provided in chapter [ cha : conclu ] .",
    "this part deals with the foundations of the electrostatic mean field theories in soft matter .",
    "it is written on a pedagogical level such that the non - specialist reader should be in a position to easily capture the underlying physics .",
    "nonetheless , the expert will also certainly find some clarifying ideas in the forthcoming discussion .",
    "the model system we have here in mind is sketched in figure [ fig : electrolyte ] .",
    "we have to deal with a uniformly charged interface with a surface charge density @xmath5 , separating the semi - infinite substrate from a simple electrolyte [ i.e. univalent cations ( @xmath6 ) and anions ( @xmath7 ) ] and whose bulk density is @xmath8 .",
    "the system is globally electroneutral and the embedding solvent is merely characterized by its dielectric constant . in this context , the first theoretical determination of counterion distribution for an inhomogeneous fluid was realized by gouy @xcite and chapman @xcite independently almost one century ago .",
    "this mean - field approach corresponding to the so - called poisson - boltzmann theory is going to be now explained and discussed . a central quantity in the statistical mechanics of fluids is the _ potential of mean force _ ( pmf ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the potential stemming from the effective force between two objects .",
    "the term `` effective '' means here a thermodynamical averaging whose form is dependent on the ensemble ( e.g. , canonical , grand canonical ) under consideration . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will consider the thermodynamical ( i.e. , macroscopic ) limit where all ensembles are equivalent .",
    "a good starting point is provided by the exact poisson equation relating the the mean electrostatic potential ( mep ) , @xmath9 , to the pmf @xmath10 as follows : @xmath11 - \\exp \\left [ -\\beta w_-(z ) \\right ] \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the relative permittivity of the solvent ( for water @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 the reduced inverse temperature with @xmath15 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 the absolute temperature .",
    "the central approximation of the pb theory is to now set : @xmath17 such that the exact poisson equation ( [ eq : poisson - eq ] ) becomes in the framework of the pb theory : @xmath18 \\quad ( \\epsilon \\equiv \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_{solv})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the well known pb equation .",
    "the resulting mep reads @xcite : @xmath19 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is given by the positive root of : @xmath21 we have introduced here in equation ( [ eq : pb_wall_mep ] ) and equation ( [ eq : pb_gamma ] ) two important length scales , namely the screening length @xmath22 : @xmath23 and the gouy - chapman length @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is another third relevant length in charged soft matter known as the bjerrum length and reads : @xmath27    the _ salt - free _ case can be actually easily obtained by considering @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : pb_wall_mep ] ) and ( [ eq : pb_gamma ] ) . doing",
    "so we find : @xmath29   + \\frac{2k_bt}{e } \\ln \\frac{\\kappa b}{2}. % \\quad { \\rm ( salt - free)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding counterion distribution , @xmath30 $ ] , is then merely given by : @xmath31 it is this formula ( [ eq : gc_wall_cou_distri ] ) that is referred to as the gouy - chapman counterion distribution .",
    "the corresponding plot can be found in figure [ fig : gouy - chapman ] .    to better understand the physical meaning involved in the approximation ( [ eq : pb - pmf - approx ] )",
    ", we shall make use of the exact so - called yvon - born - green ( ybg ) hierarchy @xcite that reads : @xmath32 g_{\\alpha \\beta}(r_{12 } , z_1 , z_2 ) \\rho_{\\beta}(z_2 ) d^3r_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : bgy ] ) can be seen as a `` newtonian '' version of the statistical poisson equation ( [ eq : poisson - eq ] ) .",
    "the left hand - side of equation ( [ eq : bgy ] ) represents the effective force felt by the test ion 1 of species @xmath33 at prescribed location @xmath34 .",
    "the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : bgy ] ) is made up of two contributions : ( i ) the first term is merely the coulomb interaction between the charged interface and the test ion 1 .",
    "( ii ) the second term involves the interaction between the test ion 1 and the remaining solute ions , with @xmath35 being the pair distribution function and @xmath36 the local ion density .",
    "if the former is approximated by @xmath37 then equation ( [ eq : bgy ] ) becomes : @xmath38}_{= q_{\\alpha } \\psi(z_1 ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the potential of mean force reduces to the mep times the charge , which is precisely the pb approximation .",
    "in other words , the pb theory neglects the ( lateral ) _ ion - ion correlations _ in that sense that @xmath39 .",
    "it is for this reason that the pb theory is a mean - field one . recalling that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the two - particle density function",
    ", one can equally well provide a geometrical interpretation : the probability of finding two ions anywhere in the solution is _ independent _ of their relative separation in the pb framework .      in general the strongly non - linear pb equation ( [ eq : pb - eq ] )",
    "can not be solved analytically , and its linearized version is therefore employed instead .",
    "this latter approach was historically first developed by debye and hckel @xcite .",
    "when the mep is everywhere small ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , the pb equation reduces to @xmath43 and the corresponding solution reads : @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the surface potential .",
    "this result can be obtained either by directly solving the dh equation ( [ eq : dh_eq ] ) or substituting the small @xmath45 value in the full pb solution equations ( [ eq : pb_wall_mep ] ) and ( [ eq : pb_gamma ] ) .    in order to more deeply understand the physical meaning of the linear approximation",
    ", we shall rewrite the dh equation ( [ eq : dh_eq ] ) in an equivalent integral equation form . in this context , it is instructive to use an approximative closure for the ( exact ) orstein - zernike equation , as done by mcquarrie for a bulk electrolyte @xcite , which leads to the dh description : @xmath46 where , the subscript `` @xmath47 '' in equations ( [ eq : dh_oz_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dh_oz_2 ] ) stands for the charged interface ( that can be envisioned as a special particle species at infinite dilution ) .",
    "thereby , this notation preserves nicely the analogy with the bulk case .",
    "the dh theory is readily obtained upon assuming that the direct correlation function is equal to the ( sign reversed ) reduced pair potential [ i.e. , @xmath48 , which becomes exact when @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in practice it is the first line ( [ eq : dh_oz_1 ] ) that is used in fluid theory to solve self - consistently the total correlation function @xmath51 or the pmf via @xmath52 .    for the sake of our discussion , however , it is the second line ( [ eq : dh_oz_2 ] ) that turns out to be instructive .",
    "indeed we see now that in the dh theory , the term @xmath53 is not trivially unity , since @xmath54 does not vanish in equation ( [ eq : dh_oz_2 ] ) , in contrast to what happens in the pb situation . hence ion - ion correlations are _ not _ neglected .",
    "this might seem at first sight counter - intuitive since the dh theory is based on the linearization of pb equation which ignores lateral correlations .",
    "this being said , in the weak coulomb regime where the dh theory is supposed to be valid , the deviations from the uncorrelated limit are then small .",
    "this last decade @xcite , a remarkable theoretical achievement has been accomplished in the other extreme limit of strong coulomb coupling .",
    "more specifically , the counterion distribution near a charged planar wall has been predicted analytically and independently by shklovskii @xcite and moreira and netz @xcite in the strong coulomb coupling regime ( i.e. , the gouy - chapman problem at low temperature ) .",
    "a common and universal feature of these two works is that the counterion distribution decays exponentially like @xmath55 .",
    "these two approaches are going to be now briefly presented .",
    "* using a field theoretic formulation applied to charged fluids @xcite , moreira and netz @xcite showed that at high coulomb coupling ( i.e. : for @xmath56 ) the counterion distribution obeys the following _ exact _ and elegant limiting law : @xmath57 with @xmath58 ( having the dimension of the inverse of a surface ) standing for the number of elementary charges per unit area .",
    "a plot of equation  ( [ eq : scc_cou_dist_netz ] ) can be found in figure [ fig : gouy - chapman ] , where a convenient visual comparison with the high temperature limit [ equation ( [ eq : gc_wall_cou_distri ] ) ] is offered . * using a fully different and more intuitive approach , shklovskii @xcite has applied wigner crystal ( wc ) concepts @xcite to the problem of soft charged matter at effective low temperature . using some heuristic but physically sound arguments , essentially based on the simple fact that a `` desorbed '' counterion from the ( triangular ) wc counterion layer is correlated to the hole left behind over the gouy - chapman length @xmath24 , shklovskii @xcite obtains ( up to the here important prefactor ) the same result [ equation ( [ eq : scc_cou_dist_netz ] ) ] as netz . interestingly ,",
    "if one combines ( i ) the wc approach that provides the correct exponential decay @xmath55 and ( ii ) the contact theorem which imposes the prefactor , @xmath59 @xcite , then one recovers the exact answer ( [ eq : scc_cou_dist_netz ] ) .      as long as the coulomb coupling between ions is `` fairly '' moderate ( which is the case for monovalent ions in aqueous solution ) , the pb theory @xcite and even the dh one @xcite describe astonishingly well the ion distribution ( and hence the thermodynamical system properties ) when compared to computer simulations @xcite , theories going beyond the mean - field pb level @xcite , and even experiments @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , as soon as ion - ion correlations get relevant , mean field theories such as the pb one @xcite or its linearized version ( as related above in [ sec : pb ] ) can not explain the experimentally observed relevant effect of overcharging @xcite .",
    "naively , one would think that the stable configuration corresponds to an exact neutralization of the macroion by the counterions .",
    "this intuition is only correct for the case where the counterions are uniformly smeared out over the surface of the colloid .",
    "indeed basic electrostatics show that , for a central charge @xmath60 ( representing the macroion ) and the shell of the counterions of radius @xmath61 and ( total ) charge @xmath62 , the electrostatic potential energy is given by @xcite @xmath63 where the first term describes the interaction between the central ion and the charged shell and the second one is the electrostatic energy stored in the shell ( i.e. , the work done upon bringing the counterions from infinity to their current location @xmath64 of the shell ) .",
    "thereby , the criterion of stability @xmath65 shows that the stable configuration corresponds to an exact neutralization . in reality , the counterions are _ discrete _ and not smeared out , and when electrostatically bound to the macroion s surface , they will maximize their separation such as to minimize the counterion - counterion repulsion .",
    "this problem turns out to be exactly the one that was addressed one century ago by thomson @xcite ( also called the thomson sphere or thomson problem ) who studied the ground state energy and structure of @xmath66 ( classical ) electrons confined on a sphere ( model of a classical atom ) .",
    "the thomson problem has only exact solutions for small @xmath66 and some magic numbers ( e.g. , @xmath67 corresponding to the fullerene structure ) @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , based on wigner crystal ideas @xcite , an analytical model was developed which quantitatively accounts for the energy gain upon adsorbing overcharging counterions @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the following relation for the energy variation @xmath68 ( relative to the globally neutral state characterized by @xmath69 overcharging counterion and @xmath70 counterions , see figure [ fig : thomson_messina ] for a typical counterion arrangement ) as a function of the number @xmath71 of ( excess ) overcharging @xmath72-valent counterions @xcite was derived : @xmath73 + \\frac{z_c^2 n^2}{2a } , \\quad { \\rm ( cgs)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) is a numerical geometrical prefactor that was determined by simulations ( deduced from the value of @xmath76 ) .",
    "the first and attractive term in equation ( [ eq : oc_en_messina ] ) stems basically from the interaction between a counterion and its oppositely charged wigner - seitz cell .",
    "energy profiles of equation ( [ eq : oc_en_messina ] ) are sketched in figure [ fig : thomson_messina ] , where one can see that these analytical predictions are pretty robust .",
    "this simple approach to the understanding of the overcharging via the thomson problem , wigner crystal concept and computer simulations has triggered a new interest in the community @xcite for the thomson problem applied to soft matter .",
    "we now consider the problem of a pair of macroions . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that two equally charged spheres are likely to be overcharged and undercharged in the strong coulomb coupling regime leading to a metastable _ ionized state _ that yields a strong long - ranged attraction due to a _",
    "monopolar _ contribution .",
    "all the mechanisms , so far reported in the literature , can only explain _ short - ranged _ like - charge attraction @xcite .    to further rationalize this phenomenon and the stability of ionized states @xcite ,",
    "two charged spheres of same radius @xmath61 , carrying the same electric sign of charge but characterized by a charge ratio @xmath77 such that @xmath78 , were considered .",
    "starting from a macroion pair where each macroion is neutralized by its counterions , the process where a counterion is transfered from macroion @xmath79 ( low bare charge ) to macroion @xmath80 ( high bare charge ) was investigated @xcite .",
    "having demonstrated that the ability of a macroion to get overcharged increases with growing ( bare ) surface charge density @xmath5 ( or the bare charge at fixed radius ) , it is clear that this counterion - transfer process will be energetically favorable below a certain value of @xmath77 .",
    "this theoretical prediction shows that the criterion for stable ionized states ( latter also called by other authors @xcite `` auto - ionization '' ) is governed by the value of @xmath81 ( with @xmath82 being the number of counterions of macroion @xmath83 ) which reflects the correlation - hole energy difference between the two macroions ( at identical radii ) .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that the higher the charge - asymmetry ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) the more stable the ionized state and concomitantly the higher the degree of ionization @xcite .",
    "the main findings related to this work @xcite , can be summarized as follows :    * the ground state of a charged sphere is always overcharged due to counterion correlations .",
    "* at finite temperature and in the strong coulomb regime ( accessible with multivalent _ aqueous _ ions ) , colloids having different bare surface charge density auto - ionize due to counterion correlations .",
    "the structural ( i.e. , bare ) charge of spherical macroions is usually modeled by a _ central _",
    "charge , which , by virtue of the gauss law , is equivalent to a _ uniformly _ charged macroion surface as far as the electrostatic field ( or potential ) _ outside _ the sphere is concerned . however , in nature the charges on the colloidal surface are _ discrete _ ( exactly as the counterions are ) and localized , see figure [ fig : discrete_charges ] .",
    "thus , a natural question that rises is : _ why _ and _ how _ does the counterion distribution depend on the way the structural charge of the macroion is represented ( i.e. , uniformly charged or discrete charges on its surface ) ?",
    "it is precisely this problem that was addressed in @xcite .    _",
    "why _ is the counterion distribution sensitive to the choice of the representation of the macroion charge ( discrete vs. uniform ) ?",
    "this question can be best answered by looking at and comparing the ( intrinsic ) electrostatic potentials generated by discretely and uniformly charged macroions ( without counterions ) @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the electrostatic potential at a reduced distance @xmath84 from the sphere ( where @xmath61 stands for the distance of closest approach between an external unit test - charge and the macroion surface ) may be significantly different according to the nature of the macroion charge .",
    "in particular we show that the higher the bare surface charge ( i.e. , the closer we get to a uniform charge distribution ) the shorter the correlation length ( typically @xmath85 ) between the discrete surface charges , as intuitively expected .",
    "more specifically , the contact potential is sensitive to the localization of the discrete charges , leading to a pronounced depth in their vicinity .",
    "all those features , solely based on the spatial behavior of the electrostatic potential stemming from the bare macroion , indicate that the counterion distribution should be much more complicated for a discrete macroion surface charge distribution than for the uniform case .",
    "we now come to the other important question : _ how _ is the counterion distribution modified when introducing the more realistic discrete macroion s surface charge distribution ?",
    "this point is thoroughly addressed in @xcite , where two regimes are considered : ground state ( @xmath86 ) and finite temperatures .",
    "the corresponding relevant findings @xcite can be summed up as follows :    * at zero temperature , the counterion ( surface ) structure possesses greater order the the higher the reduced surface charge density @xmath87 and/or counterion valence @xmath72 are . *",
    "when overcharging comes into play several scenarios occur : ( i ) at large @xmath87 , the overcharging is nearly the same as that obtained at a uniformly charged macroion s surface .",
    "( ii ) at low @xmath87 and for _ monovalent _ counterions , overcharging is always weaker for discrete macroion charge distribution , due to the ion - pairing frustration for the excess counterions .",
    "( iii ) at low @xmath87 and for _ highly multivalent _ counterions , overcharging can even be stronger in the discrete case due to ion - pairing . * at finite temperature ( in aqueous solutions ) , the volume counterion distribution is only affected for low @xmath87 and multivalent counterions .    the effect of surface charge discretization was later examined for different geometries by several groups @xcite .",
    "so far , we have had a pretty good understanding of the physics involved in the counterion distribution for _ salt - free _ systems where excluded volume effects are irrelevant .",
    "the situation becomes much more complicated at finite salt - concentrations in aqueous solutions ( i.e. , water at room temperature in the presence of added salt ) , where the coulomb coupling is ( rather ) weak especially for monovalent ions .",
    "thereby , a direct application of wigner crystal ideas is not straightforward enough to account for the unexpected overcharging at _ weak _ coulomb coupling that was reported theoretically @xcite ) , but unexplained , for _ monovalent _ salt - ions of large size .",
    "molecular dynamics computer simulations as well as integral - equation theory @xcite were employed to identify the mechanisms that govern counterions ordering and overcharging in this weak coulomb coupling regime .",
    "those mechanisms are as follows :    * increasing the electrolyte particle _ size _ ( at given salt concentration ) decreases the available volume of the fluid ( or equivalently its entropy ) which _ favors ion - ion correlations_. * the interface provided by the macroion causes an increase of the ion density close to it , and concomitantly enhances the _ lateral ordering _",
    "( similar to the prefreezing phenomenon in _",
    "neutral _ inhomogeneous fluids ) .",
    "* surface lateral ordering and ( weak ) coulomb coupling lead to overcharging .",
    "excluded volume effects coupled to electrostatic interactions can also lead to counter - intuitive phenomena in the process of macroion adsorption .",
    "a description of the model setup is sketched in figure [ fig : macroion_ads_model ] .",
    "for instance , jimenez - ngeles and lozada - cassou showed , using integral equation theory , that for moderately ( attractive ) charged substrates , a film of _ coions _ first builds up .",
    "the electrostatic consequence is that at the direct vicinity of the surface of the substrate its charge gets amplified ( i.e. , _ surface charge amplification _ ) .",
    "the driving force of this effect is due to the macroion - ion attractive correlations .",
    "this effect was overlooked in the past , because the authors neglected either the finite size of the macroion @xcite or the spatial distribution of the little salt - ions @xcite .",
    "recently , this problem was revisited by using a very simple analytical model based on the debye - hckel approximation _ but _ taking into account the finite size of the macroion via its distance of closest approach @xmath61 ( i.e. , its radius ) to the wall ( see figure [ fig : macroion_ads_model ] as well ) @xcite .",
    "two regimes were specifically examined : the strong and weak screening regimes which are now briefly described .",
    "* in the strong screening regime ( @xmath88 ) the wall - macroion attractive interaction is exclusively governed by the screening contrast @xmath89 . more precisely , it was shown that the contact potential of interaction @xmath90 is merely given by @xcite : @xmath91 * in the weak screening regime ( @xmath92 ) and for sufficiently small surface charge density ( @xmath93 ) , the reduced electric field at contact follows this simple law @xcite : @xmath94 this equation ( [ eq : small_ka_macro_ads ] ) tells us that surface charge amplification is increasing with growing colloidal particle size @xmath61 and increasing gouy - chapman length @xmath24 ( i.e. , _ decreasing _",
    "@xmath87 ) .",
    "in a typical experimental setup , the dielectric constant of a macroion is rather low ( @xmath95 ) which is much smaller than that of its embedding solvent ( e. g. , for water @xmath96 ) leading to a _",
    "high dielectric contrast _ , @xmath97 , at the interface .",
    "it turns out that for a perfect _ planar _ substrate ( which can be envisioned as a colloid of vanishing curvature ) , there is an elegant analytical solution for the electric field .",
    "more precisely , the electric field generated by the induced surface charge at the interface positioned at @xmath98 ( due to the presence of a point - like ion of charge @xmath99 located at @xmath100 ) can be exactly obtained by a `` fictive '' point - like charge @xmath101 located at the mirror position @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "this feature corresponds to the so - called method of _ image charges_. the inclusion of such image forces for the case of an electrolyte close to a planar dielectric interface was studied in the past by computer simulations @xcite , integral equation formalisms @xcite , mean - field @xcite and strong - coupling @xcite theories . as far as the cylindrical case @xcite is concerned",
    ", there is no simple `` image charge '' picture .",
    "the problem of the dielectric discontinuity in _ spherical _ geometry is , already at the level of a single ion interacting with a dielectric ( neutral ) sphere , considerably more complicated than its planar counterpart .",
    "indeed , if we want to reformulate the problem in terms of image charges , one would need an _",
    "infinite _ number of image charges , thus making its usage much less attractive than in the planar case . due to this difficulty , the problem of image charges in spherical geometry is sparsely studied in soft matter .",
    "nevertheless , twenty years ago , linse studied the counterion distribution with image forces around spherical charged micelles by means of monte carlo simulations @xcite . in his work @xcite , linse used a _ two - image _ charge approximation instead of the full continuous image charge distribution .",
    "the conclusions of his study remain qualitatively correct .",
    "the dielectric response of a dipolar fluid confined to a spherical cavity was recently addressed by blaak and hansen using md simulations @xcite .    in the field of image forces in",
    "spherical geometry , exact results for the electrostatics of an ion interacting with a dielectric sphere ( see figure [ fig : image_sphere ] for the model geometry ) were reported @xcite .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo simulations were performed to elucidate the behavior of an electrolyte near a spherical macroion at finite dielectric contrast , where image forces are properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "the main results are as follows @xcite :    * _ single ion _ : a compact and exact analytical expression has been derived for the polar profile of the induced surface charge , and it reads : @xmath103 where @xmath99 is a test ion at a radial distance @xmath104 ( see figure [ fig : image_sphere ] ) and @xmath105 designates the legendre polynomials of order @xmath106 .",
    "the _ strength _ as well as the _ range _ of image forces in spherical geometry are considerably smaller than at vanishing curvature , due to _ auto - screening_. * _ electrolyte _ : for aqueous monovalent ions the ( effective ) image force is basically equal to the _ self - image _ one ( i.e. , the interaction between an ion and its own image ) .",
    "however , when dealing with multivalent counterions , the _ lateral _ image - counterion correlations can significantly affect the ( local ) counterion density and , as a major effect , they _ screen _ the self - image repulsion . upon adding salt , it was shown that the strength of the image forces induced by the _",
    "coions _ is marginal .",
    "besides , overcharging is robust against image forces .",
    "very recently , rei and linse extended @xcite the one - colloid problem to the two - colloid interaction problem with dielectric discontinuity . using a cylindrical cell model and mc simulations",
    ", they found ( i ) weaker counterion accumulation at the macroion s surfaces , ( ii ) stronger effective repulsion at moderate coulomb coupling , and ( iii ) a less attractive effective force at strong coulomb coupling .",
    "these findings are fully consistent with the one - colloid features just discussed above .",
    "polyelectrolytes ( pes ) are polymers containing a variable ( usually large ) amount of ionizable monomer along the chemical backbone . once dissolved in a suitable polar solvent such as water , the ion pairs dissociate by creating a charged chain with floating counterions .",
    "pes represent a broad and interesting class of materials that have attracted an increasing attention in the scientific community .",
    "pes have applications in modern technology as well as biology , since virtually all proteins , as well as dna , are charged .",
    "the adsorption of pes onto surfaces is an important process , since they modify the physico - chemical properties of the surface . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "charged polymers ( in bulk or adsorbed ) are much less understood @xcite than neutral ones @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties is the addition of new length scales set by the tremendous long - ranged coulomb interaction .",
    "hence , the study of adsorption of pes is motivated by fundamental aspects as well as practical ones .        the works related to the interaction between pes and _ oppositely _ charged spheres are here briefly reviewed .",
    "the complexation of flexible pes with oppositely charged macroions is a relevant process in biology @xcite .",
    "for instance a nucleosome can be seen as an electrostatic binding between dna and histone proteins , where the latter can be envisioned as charged spheres .",
    "many theoreticians @xcite have investigated these types of objects to understand the electrostatics governing those structures .",
    "two very relevant results are : ( i ) the possible overcharging of the sphere by the long pe and ( ii ) a strong wrapping of the pe about the sphere ( see figure [ fig.tennis_ball ] for an example ) .",
    "a considerable effort was also provided by the simulators @xcite these last twelve years .",
    "some relevant findings in this field can be summarized as follows :    * _ the effect of chain stiffness _ , which was first systematically studied by wallin and linse @xcite by mc simulations , is an important key controlling the pe adsorption .",
    "they showed that the lower the chain stiffness , the higher the pe adsorption and , concomitantly , the overcharging of the charged sphere by the pe .",
    "stoll and chodanowski @xcite , using mc simulation as well but with yukawa potentials , showed that upon increasing the chain stiffness , _ solenoid _ conformations are obtained as predicted analytically by nguyen and shklovskii @xcite . * _ the effect of chain length _ was also addressed ( by means of computer simulations ) in the past @xcite . for large chain / sphere size ratio , chodanowski and stoll @xcite found , for fully flexible chains , that only a marginal portion of the pe gets adsorbed to the sphere , and the rest of the chain consists of extended tails .",
    "at `` moderate '' chain / sphere size ratio @xcite , they found a strong pe collapse into a tennis - ball like structure ( as illustrated in figure [ fig.tennis_ball ] ) .",
    "considering _ both _ the effects of chain length and the chain stiffness , akinchina and linse @xcite reported a rich phase behavior : tennis - ball like , solenoid , multiloop ( also called rosette @xcite ) , single loop , as well as `` u''-shaped conformations .",
    "note , that there is remarkable agreement with the rosette structure found theoretically by schiessel et al .",
    "@xcite . * the effect of the _ discrete _ nature of the protein charge distribution was addressed by carlsson et al .",
    "@xcite . in their mc simulations",
    "@xcite , they found that complexation can be stronger with a discrete protein charge distribution ( in agreement with the ideas discussed in [ sec : dcc ] ) . * _ multisphere _ complexation involving many charged spheres bridged via oppositely charged pes were investigated by jonsson and linse @xcite by means of mc simulations .",
    "the effect of linear chain charge density , chain length , and macroion charge valency was addressed in ref .",
    "interestingly , at prescribed pe linear charge density , the authors found that complexation gets stronger upon increasing the chain length @xcite .",
    "the effect of chain flexibility was studied in @xcite , and it was found that the macroion arrangement gradually becomes more linear and ordered along the ( long ) chain when its stiffness is increased .      whereas many studies have been devoted for the case of chain - sphere complexation where the two charged bodies are oppositely charged , as we just saw , much less is known concerning the problem of _ like - charge sphere - pe complexation_.    in @xcite , the complexation between a sphere and a long flexible pe ( _ both negatively charged _ ) was discussed . whereas like - charge attraction in the strong coulomb coupling limit is expected ( and therefore complexation too ) ,",
    "new and rather unexpected chain conformations are reported .",
    "different coupling regimes as well as the influence of the linear charge density , @xmath107 , of the pe chain were considered in @xcite .",
    "the relevant conclusions are as follows :    * at strong coupling the pe chain is always adsorbed in a _",
    "flat _ structure , whose conformation strongly depends on @xmath107 . at high @xmath107 ,",
    "the conformation consists of densely packed monomers following a hamiltonian - walk . upon reducing @xmath107",
    "the chain tends to spread more and more over the particle surface .",
    "these findings could have some relevance for organic solutions .",
    "* under _ aqueous _ conditions , complexation can be obtained with multivalent counterions and for high enough values of @xmath107 .",
    "in contrast to the strong coupling case , the formation of _ loops _ is reported .",
    "the reader who wants to know a detailed account of the field of pe adsorption at surfaces is invited to consult the recent reviews of netz and andelamn @xcite and of dobrynin and rubinstein @xcite . in this part",
    ", one would like to propose some basic ideas and features supported by mc simulations about the adsorption of highly charged polyelectrolytes onto oppositely charged _ planar _ surfaces in a salt - free environment @xcite .",
    "flexible @xcite as well as rod - like @xcite pes are now discussed .",
    "there is a simple and clear entropic mechanism that influences _ multi - polymer - chain _ adsorption that is going to be pointed out first",
    ". it can be best understood by recalling the _ counterion release _ effect : the adsorption process of _ one _ polyion of valence @xmath108 typically leads to the release into solution of @xmath108 ( initially adsorbed ) surface monovalent counterions , which is `` electrostatically invariant '' but entropically ( highly ) favorable .",
    "_ this very same effect is also the reason why longer chains can better adsorb at a prescribed monomer density_. indeed , at prescribed monomer density , increasing the chain length @xmath109 involves decreasing the the number of chains .",
    "thereby , the resulting ( bulk ) entropy stemming from the pe chains becomes reduced accordingly .",
    "this entropic mechanism linked to the chain length at prescribed monomer density is henceforth referred to as : _ polymerization induced adsorption_.",
    "@xcite    when _ no _ image forces are present ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) , it was found that the monomer density profile , @xmath111 , decays monotonically for very short chains even near contact , see figure [ fig.pe_rig_flex_nz](a ) .",
    "longer chains experience a short - ranged repulsion in the vicinity of the charged wall ( @xmath112 ) due to _ chain - entropy _ effects .",
    "image forces _ come into play , ( partial ) monomer desorption sets in , whose strength increases with growing chain length @xmath109 .",
    "this feature is due to the repulsive image - chain interaction that scales like @xmath113 , whereas the attractive wigner crystal correlations scales only like @xmath114 .",
    "the fraction of charge @xmath115 of the fluid as a function of monomer - wall separation , @xmath116 , is another interesting quantity to characterize the adsorption behavior . at @xmath110 , overcharging [ as signaled by @xmath117",
    "occurs as soon as chains are longer than dimers , see figure 4(a ) in @xcite . in the presence of image forces ,",
    "the strength of the overcharging is nearly identical to that obtained without image forces at @xmath110 ( compare with figure 4(a ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . thereby , the main effect of image charges is ( i ) to decrease the fraction of charge @xmath115 near contact ( @xmath118 ) upon growing @xmath109 and ( ii ) to ( slightly ) shift the position of the maximum of @xmath115 to larger @xmath116 .",
    "@xcite    dimers exhibit a monotonic behavior for @xmath111 that is similar to point - like ions . for longer chains",
    "there exits a small monomer depletion near the charged wall for an _ intermediate _ regime of @xmath109 , see figure [ fig.pe_rig_flex_nz](a ) . at high enough @xmath109",
    ", @xmath111 reveals again a monotonic behavior , see figure 1(a ) in ref .",
    "this interesting effect is the result of two antagonistic _ entropy_-driving forces , namely , ( i ) chain - entropy and ( ii ) polymerization induced adsorption .",
    "electrostatic chain - chain correlations , whose strength grows in a non - trivial way with @xmath109 , favor also chain adsorption .",
    "figure [ fig.pe_rig_flex_nz](a ) clearly shows that the adsorption of rigid pes is much stronger than that of flexible ones .",
    "this feature is also detectable in the snapshots , see figure [ fig.pe_rig_flex_nz](b ) and [ fig.pe_rig_flex_nz](c ) .    upon polarizing the interface",
    ", it is found that the degree of adsorption is considerably reduced .",
    "nonetheless , a comparison with the flexible case @xcite shows that the values at contact at finite @xmath119 are quite similar .      to sum up , mc",
    "simulations @xcite show us that :    * without a dielectric discontinuity ( @xmath110 ) , _ flexible _ pe chains experience short - ranged repulsion near the charged substrate due to chain - entropy effects . in contrast , _ rigid _ pe chains are more strongly adsorbed ( due to a weaker loss of chain - entropy ) and , when long enough , experience a purely effective attraction .",
    "* image forces lower the degree of adsorption for flexible and rigid pe chains .",
    "however , the overcharging of the substrate by the pes is robust ( irrespective of the chain flexibility ) against image forces .",
    "pe multilayer thin films are often obtained using a so - called layer - by - layer deposition technique @xcite : a ( say negatively ) charged substrate is alternatively exposed to a polycation ( pc ) solution and a polyanion ( pa ) one .",
    "this method and the resulting materials have a fantastic potential of application in technology , e. g. , biosensing @xcite , catalysis @xcite , nonlinear optical devices @xcite , nanoparticle coating @xcite , etc .    from the theoretical side the literature is rather poor .",
    "however , a few analytical works about pe multilayers on charged planar surfaces based on different levels of approximation are available @xcite .",
    "solis and olvera de la cruz considered the conditions under which the spontaneous formation of polyelectrolyte layered structures can be induced by a charged wall @xcite . based on debye - hckel approximations for the electrostatic interactions , but including some lateral correlations by the consideration of given adsorbed pe structures , netz and joanny@xcite found a remarkable stability of the ( semi - flexible ) pe multilayers supported by scaling laws .",
    "for weakly charged flexible polyelectrolytes at high ionic strength , qualitative agreements between theory @xcite , also based on scaling laws , and experimental observations @xcite ( such as the predicted thickness and net charge of the pe multilayer ) were achieved .",
    "more recently , shafir and andelman , using mean - field theory , pointed out the relevant role of a specific strong short - range interaction between pas and pcs .",
    "a tremendous difficulty in pe multilayering is the strong electrostatic correlations between pcs and pas , which are hard to be satisfactorily taken into account in ( modified ) mean - field theories . in this respect ,",
    "computer simulations are of great help . the first simulation model for pe multilayering",
    "was developed in @xcite .",
    "later panchagnula et al . performed similar computer simulations @xcite , where the dynamical aspect was more emphasized .",
    "several types of substrate geometry were considered , from spherical particles @xcite to planar substrates @xcite via cylindrical ones @xcite .",
    "relevant simulation findings for spherical @xcite and planar substrates @xcite are going to be described .      from the study in @xcite concerning substrates with",
    "finite radii ( i. e. , charged spheres ) , one has learned that _",
    "non - electrostatic _ forces are required to obtain ( true ) pe multilayers .",
    "more precisely , by introducing a ( additional ) _ short - range _ van der waals - like attraction ( whose strength is characterized by its value at contact , @xmath120 , in units of @xmath121 ) between the substrate s surface and the ( monomers of the ) oppositely charged chains .",
    "the pe structure results then from a complicated interplay between : ( i ) pc - pa strong attraction ( favoring a collapse into a compact globular state ) and ( ii ) pe - substrate correlations ( favoring _ flat _ adsorption and _ wrapping _ around the sphere ) .",
    "briefly , the main findings in @xcite are as follows :    * flat _",
    "bilayer_-structures , involving two long oppositely charged chains , set in only for large enough @xmath120 . at low @xmath120 , the strong driving pa - pc force leads to pe globular structures , see figure [ fig:2pe_bilayer_sph ] . *",
    "stable and flat multilayers are only obtainable at large enough @xmath120 . in a purely electrostatic regime ( @xmath122 )",
    "pe globules are formed preventing a uniform coverage of the surface , see figure [ fig:12pe_mlayer_sph ] .",
    "* short chains are not suitable candidates for pe multilayers , due to ( i ) the weaker effect of polymerization adsorption and ( ii ) reduced chain - chain correlations .",
    "pe multilayering onto planar substrates were investigated in @xcite .",
    "the zero - curvature case differs qualitatively from the spherical one .",
    "first the intrinsic electric field is higher in the former case .",
    "secondly the chain - wrapping is no - longer present at zero curvature .",
    "consequently at given surface charge density , we expect a stronger pe - layering .",
    "the important results can be formulated as follows :    * as with for spherical substrates , the relevance of short - ranged non - electrostatic forces is also demonstrated here , see figure [ fig : multilayer ] .",
    "flat multilayers can not be achieved with solely electrostatic forces . *",
    "the formation of islands ( i.e. , clusters of pc - pa chains ) onto the substrate are reported @xcite and qualitatively confirm the experimental observations of the early stages of pe deposition ( one or two bilayers ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known from solid state studies that strongly confined ( i.e. , quasi two - dimensional ) systems exhibit properties and a phase behavior that may drastically differ from those in the bulk @xcite .",
    "this feature is also vivid in colloidal systems , and those materials represent ideal model systems to analyze ( experimentally as well as theoretically ) and understand confinement effects on a mesoscopic scale corresponding to the interparticle distance . using external fields ,",
    "a colloidal system can be prepared in a controlled way into prescribed equilibrium and non - equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "for instance , in equilibrium , solidification near interfaces ( provided by a substrate or a large `` impurity '' ) can occur under thermodynamic conditions where the bulk is still fluid ( so - called prefreezing ) . in non - equilibrium ,",
    "a wall may act as a center of heterogeneous nucleation ( favored by the excess surface - energy already offered by the wall / nucleus interface ) and initiate crystal growth .",
    "most of our experimental knowledge of freezing in a confining slit - like geometry is based on real - space measurements of mesoscopic model systems such as charged colloidal suspensions between glass plates @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "different relevant achievements in the field of confined charged colloidal crystals are discussed .",
    "two - dimensional colloidal systems can be achieved for instance via sedimentation and trapping at the air / water interface @xcite . at strong external field ,",
    "all the dipolar moments are aligned in the direction of the applied external field , leading to a purely repulsive pair interaction that scales like : @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 stand for the induced dipolar moments of the particles @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .    whereas the one - component situation trivially yields a triangular lattice , the _",
    "binary mixture _ situation provides a very rich phase behavior @xcite .",
    "this feature can be conveniently exploited for potential technological applications : optical band - gap materials ( so - called photonic crystals ) @xcite , molecular sieves @xcite , nano - filters with prescribed porosity @xcite , etc .",
    "there have been recent advances in this field that are going to be concisely explained here .",
    "two dimensional binary mixtures made up of two types of dipolar particles [ ( i ) big particles with a large dipolar moment ( species @xmath80 ) and ( ii ) small particles with a small dipolar moment ( species @xmath79 ) ] were investigated experimentally @xcite . the corresponding setup and a representative snapshot of the microstructure",
    "are shown in figure [ fig:2d_dipole_exp ] .",
    "a remarkable feature is the stability of the square phase at strong dipolar asymmetry ( @xmath128 ) .    on the theoretical side , the phase behavior of such a binary dipolar mixture at zero temperature",
    "was studied using lattice sums @xcite .",

    "the main results are as follows :    * the phase diagram qualitatively differs from that of hard disks @xcite . for",
    "low dipolar asymmetry @xmath131 a stable mixture @xmath132 sets in ( see figure [ fig:2d_dipole_assoud ] ) in contrast to the case of hard - disk mixtures where _ no _ mixture is predicted at low size asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the stability of this phase @xmath132 was also reported in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . at",

    "* the stability of the square phase @xmath135 ( see figure [ fig:2d_dipole_assoud ] ) is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental findings in @xcite , where the dominance of the square phase is also reported ( see figure [ fig:2d_dipole_exp ] ) as previously mentioned .",
    "crystalline bilayers made up of charged particles have been intensively studied these last years in the soft matter colloid community @xcite as well as in the solid state physics ( classical @xcite and non - classical electrons @xcite ) and dusty plasma communities @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction between these constitutive mesoscopic macroions is neither hard - sphere like nor purely coulombic , but it is rather described by an intermediate screened coulomb [ also called yukawa or dlvo ( derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ) @xcite ] due to the screening mediated by the additional microions present in the system .",
    "the screening strength can be tuned by varying the microion concentration : for colloidal systems , salt ions can be conveniently added to the aqueous suspension ; the dusty plasma , on the other hand , consists of electrons and impurity ions .",
    "the _ equilibrium _ phase diagram at zero temperature of crystalline bilayers was investigated theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the constitutive ( point - like ) particles interact via a yukawa pair potential of the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 sets the energy scale .",
    "the choice of this potential is motivated by the experimental model systems described above .",
    "the crystalline bilayer consists of two ( identical ) layers containing in total @xmath66 particles in the @xmath138 plane .",
    "the corresponding ( total ) surface density @xmath139 is then given by @xmath140 , with @xmath80 being the ( macroscopic ) layer area .",
    "the distance @xmath141 , separating the two layers in the @xmath116-direction , is prescribed by an ( implicit ) external potential confining the system .",
    "the zero - temperature phase behavior is fully determined by two dimensionless parameters , namely the reduced layer density , @xmath142 , and the reduced screening strength , @xmath143 . using a straightforward lattice sum technique ,",
    "the phase diagram was calculated for arbitrary @xmath144 and @xmath145 , see figure [ fig : pd_bl_yukawa ] .",
    "the most interesting findings @xcite are as follows :    * whereas the two known extreme limits of zero @xcite and infinite @xcite screening strength @xmath144 are recovered by lattice sum calculations @xcite , it is demonstrated that , at intermediate @xmath144 , the phase behavior is strikingly different from a simple interpolation between these two limits .",
    "first , there is a first - order coexistence between two different staggered rhombic lattices ( iva and ivb in figure [ fig : pd_bl_yukawa ] ) differing in their relative shift of the two unit cells .",
    "second , the staggered rhombic phase iva exhibits a novel reentrant effect for fixed density and varied screening length , see figure [ fig : pd_bl_yukawa ] .",
    "depending on the density , the reentrant transition can proceed via a staggered square iii or a staggered triangular solid v including even a _",
    "double reentrant transition _ of the rhombic phase iva , see figure [ fig : pd_bl_yukawa ] .",
    "* a comparative study @xcite of the phase behavior of highly charged colloidal spheres in a confined wedge geometry reveals semi - quantitative agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the _ non - equilibrium _ case at finite temperature as driven by a linear shear flow has been addressed in @xcite . the steady state developed under shear as well as the relaxation back to equilibrium after cessation of shear",
    "were analyzed with the help of non - equilibrium brownian dynamics .",
    "the pertinent results are :    * for increasing shear rates , the following steady states are reported : first , up to a threshold of the shear rate , there is a static solid which is elastically sheared .",
    "then , at higher shear rates the crystalline bilayer melts , and even higher shear rates lead to a reentrant solid stratified in the shear direction . * after instantaneous cessation of shear , a nonmonotonic behavior of the typical relaxation time is found . in particular , application of high shear rates accelerates the relaxation back to equilibrium since shear - induced ordering facilitates the growth of the equilibrium crystal . * the orientation of a crystalline bilayer can be tuned at wish upon applying a ( strong ) shear rate in the desired direction and subsequently letting the system relax .",
    "various electrostatic effects in soft matter have been discussed . generally speaking ,",
    "charged systems are fascinating because they simultaneously involve short - ranged excluded volume effects ( as soon as the latter are properly taken into account ) already present in neutral systems , and additionally the long - ranged coulomb interaction .",
    "the latter constitutes a formidable theoretical challenge .    in terms of similarities with classical solid state physics and ( elementary ) quantum chemistry ,",
    "two striking analogies were identified : ( i ) the overcharging occurring at a sphere reduces to the old thomson problem ; ( ii ) the ground state of two spherical macroions is ionized , with the degree of ionization ( and therefore the attraction strength ) growing with the _ difference in surface charge density _ between the two macroions .",
    "this behavior is highly reminiscent of the ( molecular ) ionic bonding @xcite where the _ difference in electronegativity _ between the two atoms governs its stability .",
    "excluded volume effects are equally important to fully understand phenomena like overcharging ( i.e. , surface charge reversal ) and surface charge amplification . for overcharging",
    ", the counterion layer can reach a high ordering when the local packing fraction is raised , by simply increasing the size of the adsorbed counterions .",
    "image forces turn out to be systematically short - ranged .",
    "their effects are only vivid close to the substrate at distances corresponding roughly to the linear size of the microions ( counterions and/or charged monomers ) . as far as the adsorption of polyelectrolytes is concerned , there are two important driving forces that act concomitantly : ( i ) the polymerization - induced adsorption that works like the principle of counterion release ( so _ entropy _ based ) and ( ii ) purely electrostatic lateral correlations ( reminiscent of the classical wigner crystal ) .    confined colloidal crystals seem to be now pretty well understood up to bilayers .",
    "there is presently some experimental @xcite and simulational @xcite evidence that , upon increasing the projected surface particle density , the transition from two - layer to three - layer structures involve four ( and even more ) layered crystalline structures .",
    "this is a problem that needs an urgent and clear understanding .    on a more `` material / engineering '' level ,",
    "multilayered structures can apparently also be experimentally obtained by combining oppositely charged colloids / micelles @xcite , instead of polyelectrolytes . to explore this new field",
    ", a considerable theoretical effort would be needed to identify the parameters phase space ( such as salt concentration , charges of the colloids and the substrates , particle size etc . ) allowing the onset of such structures without strong clustering .",
