    "the atmosphere and oceans are hugely influenced by the background planetary rotation and stable density stratification .",
    "these features virtually suppress motion in the vertical direction , rendering geophysical fluid systems , intrinsically vast in their horizontal extent compared with their limited depth , approximately two - dimensional ( 2d ) at large scales .",
    "many models derived from the theory of quasi - geostrophy exploit this simplification .",
    "one such model , governed by the charney  hasegawa ",
    "mima ( chm ) equation , is the subject of the present study .    the chm equation , which describes the evolution of potential vorticity in a shallow fluid layer with a free surface , takes the form ( pedlosky 1987 ) @xmath7 here @xmath8 , the streamfunction , is assumed to be periodic in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath11 is proportional to the free surface height anomaly .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the potential vorticity ,- term .",
    "for some studies concerning the effects of this term , see kukhakin & orszag ( 1996 ) , okunu & masuda ( 2003 ) and smith ( 2004 ) . ] where @xmath0 is the rossby deformation wavenumber ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the coriolis frequency and @xmath15 is the small - scale gravity waves speed , both assumed constant ) .",
    "the differential operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the jacobian and two - dimensional laplacian .",
    "( [ chm ] ) expresses material conservation of potential vorticity .",
    "it also governs the evolution of quasi-2d fluctuations of the electrostatic potential in a plane perpendicular to a strong magnetic field applied uniformly to a plasma , in which case @xmath11 is the electrostatic potential and @xmath18 is the ion larmor radius ( hasegawa & mima 1978 ) .",
    "the chm equation has been a subject of active research for decades ( see for example , hasegawa & mima 1978 ; fyfe & montgomery 1979 ; yanase & yamada 1984 ; larichev & mcwilliams 1991 ; ottaviani & krommes 1992 ; kukharkin , orszag & yakhot 1995 ; iwayama , shepherd & watanabe 2002 ; arbic & flierl 2003 ; tran & bowman 2003 ) .",
    "a majority of these studies have been concerned with the dual transfer of the total energy @xmath19 and potential enstrophy @xmath20 , which are conserved by the chm nonlinearities . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes a spatial average .",
    "the kinetic energy and the usual enstrophy are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ( these are not conserved ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the potential energy .",
    "in addition to the total energy and potential enstrophy , the chm dynamics also conserve an infinite class of potential vorticity norms , including the @xmath25 norm @xmath4 .",
    "similar to 2d navier  stokes ( ns ) turbulence , the dual conservation law implies that the total energy ( potential enstrophy ) is preferentially transferred to lower ( higher ) wavenumbers . unlike 2d ns turbulence ,",
    "each of the invariants in chm turbulence consists of two components .",
    "the presence of the second component is due to the elasticity of the free surface , which is known to have a fundamental influence on the dynamics .",
    "a remarkable effect is that the inverse energy transfer for wavenumbers @xmath26 ( the so - called potential energy regime ) , the motion is inherently three - dimensional ( cf . dritschel & de la torre jurez 1996 ; dritschel , de la torre jurez & ambaum 1999 ) and therefore poorly described by ( [ chm ] ) . ]",
    "is predominantly a transfer of the potential energy ( tran & bowman 2003 ) , i.e. of the quadratic quantity @xmath27 .",
    "numerical studies of chm turbulence appear to suggest that in the potential energy regime , the inverse cascade is strongly impeded . for turbulence decaying from an initial energy reservoir , @xcite observe a `` slowness '' in the turbulent evolution .",
    "iwayama ( 2002 ) notice the formation of a sharp spectral peak , a manifestation of an inverse energy transfer with limited extent in wavenumber space .",
    "@xcite find that the inverse cascade slows down and that vortex merging takes a very long time . for forced turbulence , kukharkin ( 1995 )",
    "observe the formation of vortical `` quasicrystals '' , states of long - lived inactive vortices .",
    "while these observations are consistent with the finding of tran & bowman ( 2003 ) that the inverse energy transfer involves virtually no kinetic energy when @xmath26 , they are not fully explained by this fact .",
    "a more satisfactory explanation would be that the inverse transfer of potential energy is also impeded in this regime .",
    "in this note we derive an upper bound for the growth rate of a characteristic length scale associated with the inverse energy transfer .",
    "we infer from this upper bound that in the potential energy regime , the inverse energy transfer is strongly impeded by the elasticity of the free surface .",
    "an interesting physical interpretation of this effect is that this elasticity prohibits the merger of large - scale vortices to form larger energy - carrying scales , effectively rendering such vortices long - lived and inactive .",
    "although this effect is deduced in the framework of unforced and inviscid dynamics , it also manifests itself in a forced - dissipative version of ( [ chm ] ) , as is illustrated by some numerical results .",
    "the nonlinear transfer of energy to lower wavenumbers of an energy reservoir ( when it occurs ) necessarily entails an increase of a suitably defined length scale representing the energy centroid of the reservoir .",
    "here we consider the length scale @xmath2 defined by @xmath28 in ( [ ell ] ) the operator @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the wavenumber and @xmath32 the fourier transform of @xmath33 .",
    "the growth rate @xmath1 provides a quantitative measure of the inverse transfer .",
    "in particular , a smaller rate corresponds to an inverse transfer with a more limited extent in wavenumber space than one with a greater rate . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath1 may be considered as a measure of locality of the inverse transfer , in the sense that for a given energy distribution a smaller rate implies a more local transfer than a greater one .    in the case where most of the kinetic energy resides in wavenumbers @xmath26 ( the potential energy regime ) , @xmath34 is negligible compared with @xmath35 , and similarly @xmath36 is negligible compared with @xmath37 .",
    "more precisely , in this regime we have @xmath38 where the first inequality is due to hlder s inequality ( see also tran & shepherd 2002 and tran 2004 ) , implying @xmath39 . for an energy reservoir in the potential energy regime ,",
    "the length scale @xmath2 specifies where , in wavenumber space , most of @xmath27 ( or equivalently most of the potential energy ) is distributed .",
    "its growth rate is thus the rate at which the spectral profile of the potential energy proceeds toward lower wavenumbers .",
    "the evolution equation for the characteristic length scale @xmath2 , defined in the preceding paragraphs , is obtained by multiplying ( [ chm ] ) by @xmath40 and taking the spatial average of the resulting equation : @xmath41 where the various manipulations of the nonlinear term are straightforward . in particular ,",
    "the last step can be readily seen by expressing the streamfunction in terms of a fourier series .    the ratio in front of @xmath4 on the right - hand side of ( [ evol1 ] ) can be closely estimated in terms of conserved quantities .",
    "for that purpose , let us denote by @xmath5 the conserved length scale representing the enstrophy centroid of the reservoir : @xmath42 solving ( [ enscentroid ] ) for @xmath27 and substituting the result into the said ratio we obtain @xmath43 this is a very sharp estimate , especially for a reservoir in the potential energy regime .",
    "we note that in general the inequality @xmath44 holds .",
    "this is a consequence of the hlder inequality and can be shown as follows .",
    "let us denote by @xmath45 the power spectrum of @xmath46 .",
    "the length sales @xmath2 and @xmath5 can then be expressed in terms of @xmath45 as @xmath47 and @xmath48 now by hlder s inequality we have @xmath49 from which the inequality @xmath44 indeed follows immediately .",
    "putting these results together we have @xmath50 using @xmath44 .",
    "hence the exponential growth rate of @xmath2 is bounded from above by @xmath51 . given a finite @xmath4 , the upper bound @xmath51 can be made arbitrarily small provided @xmath52 is sufficiently large .",
    "this condition is satisfied for an initial energy reservoir in a sufficiently remote wavenumber region of the potential energy regime , where both @xmath53 and @xmath54 . under these circumstances , no significant growth of @xmath2",
    "occurs when the initial energy reservoir freely spreads out , and hence no significant inverse energy transfer is possible . in passing it",
    "is worth mentioning that the upper bound for the exponential growth rate of @xmath2 in ( [ evol2 ] ) consists of the constant @xmath0 and the two invariants @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and therefore can be completely determined by initial data .",
    "the result in the preceding paragraph is an analytic version of the qualitative statement in the literature that the turbulence evolves on a rescaled ( slower ) time ( cf .",
    "larichev & mcwilliams 1991 ; kukharkin , orszag & yakhot 1995 ) . to clarify this point",
    "let us rewrite ( [ evol2 ] ) as @xmath55 the left - hand side of ( [ evol3 ] ) is the ( instantaneous ) growth rate of @xmath2 on the slow time @xmath56 .",
    "for an initial reservoir with a finite @xmath4 , the inverse transfer of potential energy can be considerable only on this slow time scale . in the limit @xmath57 , the invariants become @xmath58 and @xmath22 and",
    "the length scales @xmath2 and @xmath5 become @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the rescaled time @xmath61 becomes infinitely long .    an estimate which may be significantly sharper than ( [ evol2 ] )",
    "can be derived by replacing the potential vorticity @xmath62 in ( [ evol1 ] ) by the relative vorticity @xmath63 . by doing that , instead of ( [ evol2 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath64 in remote regions of the potential energy regime , where @xmath65 , we expect @xmath66 to dominate @xmath63 .",
    "therefore in these regions it is plausible that @xmath67 , allowing ( [ evol4 ] ) to become significantly sharper than ( [ evol2 ] ) .",
    "the price for this improvement is that @xmath68 is not conserved .",
    "note that in such regions @xmath2 and @xmath5 are the length scales of potential and kinetic energy , respectively .",
    "a straightforward physical interpretation of the above result is that the elasticity of the free surface suppresses energy transfer for scales larger than the rossby deformation radius .",
    "this effect has a profound influence on the vortex dynamics .",
    "let us consider a hypothetical flow consisting of vortices ( having smooth potential vorticity  no small length scales ) of comparable scales , which are much larger than the deformation radius @xmath18 .",
    "for these scales the inverse energy transfer is strongly impeded , allowing for virtually no formation of larger energy - carrying scales .",
    "this keeps the vortices from merging , effectively establishing a state of long - lived inactive vortices .",
    "this may explain the crystallisation of vortices observed by kukharkin ( 1995 ) .",
    "the impeded inverse energy transfer implies a similar effect on the direct transfer of potential enstrophy , a consequence of the dual conservation law .",
    "one can see from the `` symmetry '' of the dual conservation law that the available potential enstrophy for direct transfer depends on the inversely - transferred energy .",
    "similarly , the available energy for inverse transfer depends on the directly - transferred potential enstrophy .",
    "hence impeded inverse energy transfer means impeded direct potential enstrophy transfer ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this implies that smooth potential vorticity with scales @xmath69 remains smooth .",
    "we now consider results obtained from numerical simulations of a forced - dissipative version of ( [ chm ] ) .",
    "these convincingly illustrate the strong reduction of the inverse transfer in the potential energy regime , and may help explain an observation by iwayama ( 2002 ) in their numerical simulations of freely decaying chm turbulence wherein an initial energy reservoir evolves into a single sharp peak .",
    "a plausible explanation for this observation is that the sharp peak is due to both the viscous dissipation ( which suppresses the formation of small scales ) and the impeded inverse transfer deduced in the preceding section : their collective effect `` squeezes '' energy into a narrow band of wavenumbers , resulting in the observed peak . in our forced - dissipative case we observe that in the potential energy regime the inverse energy flux is arrested and deposits most of the potential energy at the lower - wavenumber end of the quasi - steady energy range .",
    "we also observe a relaxation of the kinetic energy spectrum of the inertial range ( from @xmath70 toward @xmath71 ) as the inverse cascade proceeds from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "we simulate eq .",
    "( [ chm ] ) , with the addition of molecular viscosity and a body force , in a doubly periodic square @xmath74 with a dealiased @xmath75 pseudospectral method .",
    "no large - scale dissipation mechanisms are employed and no steady dynamics are sought since we are primarily interested in the near arrest of the inverse energy cascade in a quasi - steady state .",
    "( for an analysis of steady chm turbulence in the presence of large - scale damping , see smith 2002 . )",
    "three different values of @xmath0 are used : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the forcing is spectrally localised in the wavenumber interval @xmath78 $ ] , in the sense that its fourier components @xmath79 are nonzero only for those modes @xmath80 having magnitudes @xmath81 lying in the interval @xmath82 : @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the constant energy injection rate and  @xmath85 is the number of distinct wavenumbers in  @xmath82 .",
    "the viscosity coefficient is @xmath86 .",
    "the simulations were initialised with the kinetic energy spectrum @xmath87 .",

    "the accumulation of energy at low wavenumbers is clearly visible .",
    "this is attributed to the impeding effect discussed above , and not finite - size effects since the energy levels at the lowest wavenumbers are still small compared with the energy peaks .",
    "this is true for both kinetic and potential components .",
    "for @xmath91 we have a limited kinetic energy regime in the wavenumber interval @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "before the energy peak reaches @xmath91 , the dynamics of this kinetic energy regime are expected to resemble those of 2d ns turbulence : the energy cascades to low wavenumbers via a @xmath70 kinetic energy spectrum .",
    "we indeed observe a discernible @xmath70 spectrum ( not shown ) in the wavenumber range @xmath94 $ ] before the energy peak reaches @xmath91 .",
    "the dynamics after the energy peak passes @xmath0 undergo profound changes .",
    "most notably , the growth of potential energy occurs mainly around the energy peak , consistent with the reduction of the inverse energy transfer in the conservative case .",
    "another remarkable change is in the spectral slope of the energy spectrum from @xmath95 up to the forcing wavenumber @xmath96 .",
    "the slope of the kinetic energy spectrum in this region appears to relax from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "the quasi - steady , growth of energy is due primarily to that of the potential energy and the kinetic energy becomes quasi - steady .",
    "] spectrum becomes @xmath71 with an excessive accumulation of energy at the lower - wavenumber end .",
    "this unexpected feature is common to the other two cases , for which hardly any inverse transfer region exists between the forcing wavenumber and @xmath0 and for which no clear @xmath70 spectrum is formed initially .     versus time @xmath99 ( left ) and scaled time @xmath100 ( right ) for @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath77 , as labelled.,title=\"fig : \" ]   versus time @xmath99 ( left ) and scaled time @xmath100 ( right ) for @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath77 , as labelled.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the evolution of the energy centroid @xmath2 for these three cases is shown in figure [ ell_vs_time ] , on the left versus unscaled time @xmath99 and on the right versus scaled time @xmath100 .",
    "both the reduction in @xmath101 with increasing @xmath0 _ and _ the collapse of the curves when plotted versus scaled time are consistent with the growth rate bound ( [ evol2 ] ) . and @xmath5 used in ( [ evol2 ] ) . ] only the @xmath102 case stands out slightly , due to an early kinetic energy transfer which is virtually absent in the other two cases .",
    "the main result of this work is an upper bound for the growth rate of the characteristic length scale associated with the inverse energy transfer in chm turbulence .",
    "this upper bound is expressible in terms of the supremum of the potential vorticity , the characteristic length scale representing the potential enstrophy centroid of the reservoir and the rossby deformation radius .",
    "these are constants of motion , allowing the bound to be completely described in terms of initial data .",
    "it is found that in remote regions of the potential energy regime , the turbulent transfer from an initial energy reservoir becomes strongly impeded , in the sense that hardly any potential energy is transferred to lower wavenumbers .",
    "this effect has been illustrated by numerical simulations of a forced - dissipative version of the chm equation .",
    "the physical implication of the present finding is that the elasticity of the free surface hinders the nonlinear transfer of potential energy to larger scales .",
    "an interesting implication of the present result is that vortices having smooth potential vorticity and scales much larger than the rossby deformation radius are kept from merging to form larger energy - carrying scales and remain smooth .",
    "such vortices are inactive and long - lived compared to their counterparts in 2d ns turbulence .",
    "the present theory is fully consistent with other results for both forced ( kukharkin 1995 ) and freely decaying ( larichev & mcwilliams 1991 ; iwayama 2002 ; arbic & flierl 2003 ) chm turbulence , as discussed above .",
    "these , we argue , are explained by the growth rate bound ( [ evol3 ] ) and its physical interpretations given at the end of  2 .",
    "analyses of atmospheric and oceanic data yield results that could plausibly be explained by the present work .",
    "@xcite find that the spectral flux in atmospheric wind data is arrested with essentially no inertial range .",
    "@xcite find the inverse energy transfer in the oceans to be qualitatively similar to the result of @xcite .",
    "these are in remarkable agreement with the idealised numerical results noted above and with the present findings .",
    "iwayama ( 2002 ) observe `` well - behaved '' tails of the potential vorticity probability density function ( pdf)much steeper than observed in ns turbulence , see their figure 5and raise the question why it is that chm turbulence in the potential energy regime exhibits no intermittency .",
    "a speculative answer provided by the authors is based on an asymptotic version of the chm equation wherein the relative vorticity is dropped from the time - derivative term : @xmath103 this equation , as noted by iwayama ( 2002 ) , describes advection of @xmath11 by @xmath63 ( i.e. by the smaller scales of motion ) .",
    "these authors argue that this may lead to more `` random walk '' behaviour , effectively suppressing intermittency .",
    "the present study provides an alternative answer : the reduction of turbulent transfer both renders large - scale vortices inactive and discourages erratic small - scale motion .",
    "this also can account for the observed steep pdf . in some sense chm turbulence in the potential energy regime",
    "is far less turbulent than its 2d ns counterpart .",
    "the numerical simulations in  3 were carried out , using a computer code developed by john bowman , when cvt was a pacific institute for the mathematical sciences postdoctoral fellow at the university of alberta .",
