    "despite , or perhaps because of the uncertainties in representing the strong interaction by a potential , it has been a longstanding quest in nuclear physics to find simple algebraic relationships between the excitation energies of a nucleus wherever possible .",
    "attempts to achieve this have often been inspired by approximate symmetries such as wigner s supermultiplets @xcite or elliot s su(3 ) scheme @xcite .",
    "a textbook example leading to a simple energy formula is provided by the rotational - vibrational model @xcite .",
    "later , the interacting boson model @xcite used linear combinations of casimir operators of various chains of subgroups of u(6 ) to generate simple expressions for nuclear spectra .",
    "indeed , investigations into algebraic cluster models of energy levels continue to provide fruitful fields of research to the present day @xcite .    however , the symmetries invoked by these models are never perfectly realised in real nuclei , and although suggestively close agreement can often be obtained in a number of favourable cases , they generally struggle to achieve precision at the level of a few 10 s of kev .",
    "we suggest that it might be profitable to analyse the experimental data more closely without any preconceived ideas about underlying models , to see if this alone suggests any simple relations between excitation energies that could be used for predictive purposes",
    ". there have already been such suggestions from our earlier work @xcite and encouraged by these findings we examine here the deviations of our previous expressions from measured values with a view to improving their precision without sacrificing their simplicity .",
    "it will turn out that the experimental excitation energies of five consecutive states of the ground state band must be known for our recurrence relations to get started .",
    "whenever this applies , they will provide a useful tool for predicting and/or confirming the energies of the succeeding states of that band , and thus will facilitate the task of nuclear data evaluation .",
    "we believe they should be superior to the common practice of seeking to fit the energies with a rotationally inspired formula such as @xmath0 ^ 2 $ ] , since they are based purely on empirical values and are completely independent of any underlying model . in particular , they will be helpful in predicting the energy of the next state in a band beyond the highest identified to date .",
    "we have previously analysed recursion relations involving the angular momenta @xmath1 and corresponding excitation energies @xmath2 of states belonging to the ground state bands of even - even nuclei @xcite . given a pair of angular momenta @xmath3 with @xmath4 we found empirically that @xmath5 where @xmath6 increases in steps of two from an initial value @xmath7 .",
    "we note that as the spin values @xmath8 and @xmath9 change with @xmath6 their sum remains equal to @xmath10 .    in the earlier analysis @xcite we found that eq.(1 ) was satisfied to within a few percent with the deviations from that equation strongly correlated .",
    "these deviations are given by @xmath11 and here we investigate the nature and extent of the correlations between the various @xmath12 , and how they can be used to improve the agreement between theory and data .",
    "in the database shown in table 1 @xcite we have included all 87 even - even nuclei between ba and cm which have more than four protons ( or proton - holes ) and four neutrons ( or neutron - holes ) outside closed shells , and for which the ground state bands are accurately known ( i.e. with firm @xmath13 assignments ) up to at least @xmath14 .",
    "we concentrate on the typical case defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 leaving a more complete analysis to be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows that the deviations are surprisingly well described by the simple relation @xmath17 indeed , a least squares straight line fit to all 87 data points yields a gradient of @xmath18 and an intercept of @xmath19 .",
    "the figure also indicates that the six points with the highest values of @xmath20 deviate from the straight line in a statistically significant manner .",
    "these points correspond to the nuclei @xmath21ce , @xmath22ce , @xmath22nd , @xmath23sm , @xmath24gd and @xmath25os .",
    "the results for @xmath22ce are probably problematic due to backbending .",
    "there are two @xmath26 states in close proximity at 2.81111 and 3.0176 mev ( we take the first of them as the band member ) and similarly three @xmath27 states at 3.2086 , 3.7193 and 3.81765 mev ( we take the second of these as the band member ) .",
    "this band crossing feature is generally expected for nuclei with low deformation at the beginning and end of the rare - earth region @xcite . it therefore comes as no surprise that similar deviations , albeit to a lesser extent , are observed for four other nuclei in the neighbourhood of @xmath22ce .",
    "table 2 lists the states of the ground state band , and an excited band which can be expected to mix with it , for all six of these outlying nuclei .",
    "we regard these few deviations in a positive light as pinpointing unusual nuclear spectra that are worthy of more detailed scrutiny , and here we would include also @xmath28sm , @xmath29os , @xmath30th and in particular @xmath31pu .    the framework introduced above can be used to locate missing members of a band , or to check experimental assignments to the band .",
    "we illustrate the procedure for the case where all the band members up to @xmath32 are known and an estimate of the excitation energy of the @xmath33 state is required . by eq.(2 ) @xmath34 which together with eq.(3 ) result in @xmath35    table 1 lists the individual ratios @xmath36 as well as the differences @xmath37 between the theoretical values of @xmath38 given by eq.(5 ) and their experimental counterparts . omitting the clearly anomalous case of @xmath22ce we find an r.m.s .",
    "deviation of @xmath39 kev , an order of magnitude better than the results obtained when setting @xmath40 in either of eqs.(4 ) . of interest",
    "also is that the further analysis undertaken below suggests that eq.(5 ) is a particular case of a more general recurrence relation given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "this energy recurrence relation can also be obtained by assuming that the excitation energy @xmath43 may be expanded as a taylor series in angular momentum @xmath44 which converges sufficiently rapidly that fifth order and higher terms may be neglected .",
    "expanding @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 about @xmath48 we obtain @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 by successively subtracting the @xmath52 and @xmath53 terms from their @xmath54 and @xmath55 counterparts in the three equations above we completely eliminate all even powers from the taylor series expansions obtaining respectively , @xmath56 = 2e^{\\prime}(n_0 ) + { e^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(n_0 )    \\over 3 } + \\ldots\\ ] ] @xmath57 = 6e^{\\prime}(n_0 ) + 9e^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(n_0 )   + \\ldots\\ ] ] @xmath58 = 10e^{\\prime}(n_0 ) + { 250e^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(n_0 )    \\over 6 } + \\ldots\\ ] ] subtracting twice eq.(10 ) from eq.(11 ) yields @xmath59 and the right hand side of eq.(12 ) is exactly five times that of eq.(13 ) .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath60 so that taking @xmath61 we obtain eq.(5 ) which , taken together with eq.(4 ) , yields eq.(3 ) . also by putting @xmath62 in eq.(14 )",
    "we recover eq.(6 ) .",
    "we thus find that eq.(6 ) , which with @xmath63 generates the excellent agreement with the data shown in table 1 , can be derived from a taylor series expansion if terms of order five and higher are ignored .",
    "of course , we have not rigorously proved convergence of the taylor series , which depends on the ( unknown ) behaviour of the higher derivates of @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "what we have done , starting from a taylor series , is to completely eliminate all even powers of @xmath65 , and show that eqs.(3 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) follow if the remaining odd terms of order 5 and higher are ignored .",
    "this suggests that the band excitation energies @xmath2 considered here take the form of a polynomial of maximum degree four in the angular momentum @xmath65 , and we note that only cubic forms were considered in earlier work @xcite .    since eq.(6 )",
    "is satisfied by any e - dependence on @xmath65 that is of quartic or lower degree , it encompasses a number of models .",
    "it is satisfied , for example , by the idealised quadratic form @xmath66 of a perfect rotor with a constant moment of inertia , or by the anharmonic vibrator ( ahv ) model for which @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are parameters fitted to each nucleus in turn @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that although eq.(6 ) is obeyed by these models it is satisfied to the extent that inserting the model quantities on the right hand side of eq.(6 ) generates the model quantity on the left hand side .",
    "as stated in our introductory paragraph , our emphasis is to extend previous work @xcite by finding more accurate _ direct _ relations between _ experimental _ quantities .",
    "in conclusion we have found strong correlations between the deviations @xmath12 from our original relations of eq.(1 ) above .",
    "this has enabled us to write down a highly successful recursion relation , not involving any free parameters , for locating members of ground state bands from a knowledge of the excitation energies of the lower members of the band .",
    "for the specific case of @xmath15 and @xmath16 we have shown how a knowledge of the excitation energies of the @xmath71 band members allows us to predict the excitation energy of the @xmath33 state with an r.m.s .",
    "error of @xmath72 kev .",
    "we note that this is likely to be a particular case of a more general relation .",
    "although we have restricted attention here to values of @xmath65 no higher than 10 , we have observed that eq.(6 ) can be used to predict energies for states with much greater values of @xmath65 ( up to @xmath73 in some cases ) and we intend to investigate this further elsewhere .",
