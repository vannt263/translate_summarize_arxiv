    "a major source of decoherence of electron spin qubits is the hyperfine coupling of the electron spin with the surrounding disordered nuclear spins @xcite . if we want to control and eventually eliminate this source of decoherence , it is essential to fully understand the behavior of both the electron spin and the ensemble of nuclear spins . in this text",
    "we discuss such a fundamental aspect .",
    "we address the question whether the nuclear spins can achieve order through a ( ferro)magnetic phase transition . if they do the decoherence source of the hyperfine interaction",
    "is massively reduced @xcite .",
    "we focus specifically on gaas - based semiconductor heterostructures confining two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) . such systems serve as the parent system for the single electron quantum dots defining the spin qubits @xcite . yet",
    "we emphasize that the described physics remains valid for general kondo - lattice systems with interacting electrons .",
    "it turns out that the anomalous properties of the 2deg , resulting from electron interactions , are crucial for the nuclear magnetic order .",
    "the exposure to follow is an overview of our recent work published in @xcite .",
    "even though we shall be concerned mainly with fully translationally invariant 2deg , let us introduce the problem by considering a single electron spin , confined to a quantum dot .",
    "the important interaction discussed here is the hyperfine coupling between the electron spin on the dot , @xmath0 , and the surrounding lattice of nuclear spins @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the index for the lattice site at position @xmath3 ) .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath4,\\ ] ] with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and where @xmath7 with @xmath8 a proportionality constant and @xmath9 the wavefunction of the confined electron on the quantum dot .",
    "the number of nuclear spins is large , typically of order @xmath10 , and so the nuclear spins generally act as a disordered bath on the electron spin . while @xmath11 has a role similar to an external magnetic field , the last two `` flip - flop '' terms in eq .",
    "flip the electron spin and lead to the decoherence .",
    "this decoherence source can be largely suppressed when the nuclear spins order , ferromagnetically or differently , which effectively suppresses the flip - flop terms in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "there are two ways of polarizing the system , which we shall call the _ extrinsic _ ( or dynamic ) and the _ intrinsic _ ( or thermodynamic ) polarization of the nuclear spin system .",
    "extrinsic _ polarization consists in an active manipulation of the nuclear spins by the experimentalist . several methods to do this have been proposed and partially experimentally realized : the development of quantum control techniques that effectively lessen or even suppress the nuclear spin coupling to the electron spin @xcite ; the narrowing of the nuclear spin distribution @xcite ; or the dynamical polarization of the nuclear spins @xcite . yet in order to extend the spin decay time by one order of magnitude through polarization of the nuclear spins , a polarization of above 99% is required @xcite , quite far from the best result reached to date in quantum dots , which is about 60% @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , that a full polarization is achieved _ intrinsically _ as well , i.e. through a thermodynamic phase transition to , for instance , a ferromagnetic state .",
    "this is our main topic here . in what follows",
    "we give a qualitative , physical account to this possibility by introducing step by step the model , the necessary conditions , and the results .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "we first indicate how to obtain from a microscopic model an effective hamiltonian for the nuclear spins only .",
    "we show that the conditions of the mermin - wagner theorem are not met so that long range order is not forbidden in the 2d system . with a simple mean field theory we can then see under which conditions ferromagnetic order is possible and allows us to identify the first important temperature scale @xmath12 .",
    "a refinement leads to the second important temperature scale @xmath13 , which depends on the electron - electron interactions in the 2deg .",
    "the calculation of the susceptibility for interacting electrons allows to estimate @xmath13 and on the stability of the magnetic order .",
    "it turns out that nonanalytic corrections to the electron spin susceptibility are crucial .",
    "we discuss the possible forms of these corrections , allowing us to conclude with some numerical estimates for a possible nuclear order .",
    "in order to discuss thermodynamics we have to shift our point of view from electrons in quantum dots to a fully translationally invariant 2deg as it can be obtained , for instance , in a gaas heterostructure .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 describes the hamiltonian of the interacting electron gas , and @xmath16 is the hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "we have chosen here a tight binding , kondo - lattice formulation of the problem , where @xmath17 is the operator of an electron spin in a wannier state centered at lattice site @xmath2 and the @xmath18 are the nuclear spin operators as before .",
    "for gaas we have @xmath19 .",
    "notice that @xmath8 now is position - independent due to the translational symmetry .    in eq .",
    "we have not included the direct dipolar interaction between the nuclear spins .",
    "this interaction has the smallest energy scale in the system , @xmath20 nk @xcite .",
    "it is much weaker than the effective nuclear spin interaction discussed below and , in particular , @xmath21 is much smaller than typical experimental temperatures .",
    "this allows us to entirely neglect the direct dipolar interaction .    for gaas , @xmath22 @xmath23ev @xcite , which compares to typical fermi energies of @xmath24 mev @xcite .",
    "the small ratio @xmath25 implies a separation of time scales .",
    "electron relaxation times are much shorter than typical time scales of the nuclear spins .",
    "this allows us to decouple the systems and focus on the magnetic properties of the nuclear spin system alone , where the effective spin - spin interactions are carried through the response of the equilibrium electron gas to local magnetic excitations , i.e. the electron spin susceptibility .",
    "technically , the first step is to reduce the still quasi-2d ( due to the finite thickness of the 2deg ) problem to a true 2d problem .",
    "since the electrons are confined in a single mode in the direction orthogonal to the 2d plane , the nuclear spins along a column in this direction are all almost identically coupled to the electrons and so effectively locked in a ferromagnetic alignment and behave like a single ( effectively large ) nuclear spin .",
    "the problem becomes , therefore , truly 2d .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing this situation can then be obtained , for instance , through a schrieffer - wolff transformation followed by the integration over the electron degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of sites in the system , @xmath28 and the lattice indices @xmath29 run over the two - dimensional lattice with site positions @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore @xmath31 is the effective ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction @xcite , with @xmath32 the nuclear spin density and @xmath33 \\rangle }      { \\mathrm{e}}^{-\\eta t},\\ ] ] is the static electron spin susceptibility ( @xmath34 is infinitesimal ) .",
    "the fourier transforms are defined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath27 is the number of sites in the system .",
    "we shall henceforth consider only isotropic electron systems , allowing us to drop the @xmath37 index in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "much of the magnetic properties of the nuclear spins depends , therefore , directly on the shape of @xmath40 , i.e. on the electron susceptibility @xmath41 .",
    "below we will first investigate which features of @xmath41 are required such that nuclear ferromagnetism is stable .",
    "then we shall see that electron interactions can indeed lead to such a behavior .    yet before starting we have to comment on the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite , which states that long range order in heisenberg - like models in 2d is impossible , provided that the interactions are sufficiently short ranged .",
    "the rkky interaction , however , is long ranged .",
    "but it is also oscillatory , and it has been conjectured recently @xcite that the mermin - wagner theorem extends to rkky interactions that are carried by noninteracting electrons . below we find a direct confirmation of this conjecture , indicating that electron interactions in addition to the long range character of @xmath40 play the crucial role .",
    "as a first ( naive ) approach , we can look at the problem of nuclear magnetism on the mean field level , similar to the approach used by frhlich and nabarro ( fn ) for bulk metals more than 60 years ago @xcite .",
    "we skip here the explicit calculation as it is a standard weiss mean field calculation . instead ,",
    "let us clearly state the main assumption behind fn s approach : if we look at the hamiltonian we see that the energy can classically be minimized if the @xmath42 align in a single spatial fourier mode @xmath43 corresponding to the maximum of @xmath40 .",
    "if this maximum is reached at @xmath44 , the ground state is ferromagnetic .",
    "fn implicitly assumed that the physics is entirely determined by this maximum energy scale @xmath45 and investigated the hamiltonian @xmath46 , for which the mean field theory is exact .",
    "we have to retain two important points from this theory : on the one hand , the ground state depends on the maximum of the @xmath40 , and a ferromagnet is only possible if it is reached at @xmath47 .",
    "a @xmath48 implies a different magnetic order , e.g. a helimagnet . on the other hand , this theory depends on a single energy scale , @xmath49 ( e.g. @xmath45 ) , which we associate with a temperature @xmath12 through @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the boltzmann constant . since this is the only energy scale in the system , all thermodynamic quantities must directly depend on it .",
    "for instance , the curie temperature is given by @xcite @xmath52",
    "the mean field theory is , however , inconsistent with the rkky interactions for noninteracting electrons . in the noninteracting case",
    "the electron spin susceptibility is exactly known and is given by the lindhard function @xcite , which is constant for @xmath53 [ see fig . [",
    "fig : chi ] ( a ) ] , where @xmath54 is the fermi momentum .",
    "there is therefore no well defined @xmath43 at which @xmath40 is maximum .",
    "`` guessing '' a ground state about which we can proceed with a mean field theory as above is no longer possible .     for ( a ) noninteracting electrons in 2d ( lindhard function ) ,",
    "( b ) interacting electrons such that a nuclear ferromagnet would be stable . in case ( b ) the interactions introduce a new scale @xmath13 associated with the slope of the curve at small @xmath55 [ see eq . ] , represented by the thick line next to the curve .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ]    in fact , it is straightforward to show that such a ground state can not be stable . for this purpose",
    "we look at fluctuations about an ordered ground state . in heisenberg type systems the lowest lying excitations are magnons , collective long ranged spin wave excitations .",
    "the calculation of the magnon dispersion about a ferromagnetic order is a standard textbook exercise ( see e.g. @xcite ) and leads to @xmath56 we shall henceforth assume that @xmath40 is independent of the direction of @xmath43 and write @xmath57 , @xmath58 , as well as @xmath59 .",
    "the fact that @xmath57 is constant for @xmath60 means that there is a continuum of magnon excitations at zero energy @xmath61 [ see fig . [",
    "fig : omega ] ( c ) ] , and every magnon slightly decreases the global magnetization .",
    "the assumed ground state magnetization can not be stable , the nuclear spin system is disordered .",
    "this is a direct illustration of the extension of the mermin - wagner theorem conjectured in @xcite .    from eq .",
    "we see , however , that a ferromagnetic ground state becomes stable if @xmath59 [ i.e. @xmath58 ] increases monotonically with @xmath55 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ( b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] ( d),(e ) ] . as we shall see below , nonanalytic corrections to @xmath58 by electron - electron interactions",
    "can indeed lead to a _ linear _ increase in @xmath55 .",
    "the main effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ( b ) .",
    "the electron - electron interactions modify the rkky interaction @xmath57 in that they introduce a new energy scale @xmath13 , which characterizes the shape of @xmath57 .",
    "stronger electron - electron interactions lead to a larger slope of the linear increase of @xmath58 at small @xmath55 . using this slope and @xmath63 as the only inverse length scale available for the electron gas",
    ", the new energy scale must be set by the quantity @xmath64 the physics is , therefore , no longer dominated by the single scale @xmath12 .",
    "thermodynamic quantities such as the magnetization per site @xmath65 or the critical temperature @xmath66 must be a function of these available scales : @xmath67 , etc .",
    "we can again use the magnon description to shed more light on this dependence .",
    "the average magnetization per site can be written as @xmath68 with @xmath69 the nuclear lattice constant .",
    "the summation / integration runs over the first brillouin zone of the nuclear system .",
    "we see that this integral converges if @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and so the linear corrections to the susceptibility are essential for the existence of a finite critical temperature .",
    "the magnon integral is dominated by this linear behavior up to @xmath72 . for these temperatures",
    ", we can explicitly calculate the magnon integral and obtain @xmath73 with @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fermi wavelength .",
    "we stress that the calculation leading to eq .",
    "is valid only in the limit @xmath76 , where the spin waves form a dilute gas . at higher temperatures",
    "the number of spin waves increases and their wavelengths become shorter , leading to a breakdown of the spin wave theory . the temperature @xmath77 in eq .",
    "has to be interpreted accordingly : we see that @xmath77 sets a characteristic temperature scale for the magnetization @xmath65 .",
    "further corrections to eq . , and mainly the dependence on @xmath12 , are of exponential form , @xmath78 , and are uniquely determined by the spin wave modes beyond the validity of the theory .",
    "in addition , from fig . [",
    "fig : chi ] , we see that @xmath13 generally ( i.e. for not too weak interactions ) is comparable to @xmath12 , which is proportional to the maximum of @xmath58 .",
    "this means that up to temperatures @xmath79 , the magnetization is essentially independent of the @xmath12 scale .",
    "if we conjecture on this basis that @xmath12 indeed is insignificant for the thermodynamics , then @xmath77 must set the scale for the curie temperature @xmath66 , @xmath80 in contrast to the mean field result , this estimate is consistent with @xmath81 for noninteracting electrons",
    ". the prefactor @xmath82 ( in gaas ) is a consequence of coupling the electron system ( with length scale @xmath83 ) to the nuclear spin system ( with length scale @xmath69 ) , and leads to a strong increase of the characteristic temperature @xmath77 compared with @xmath13 .",
    "a further discussion of the renormalization of @xmath77 can be found in @xcite .    in order to give a numerical estimate of @xmath77 we need to investigate the interactions between electrons in the 2deg .     [ eq . ] , equal to the shifted and rescaled electron spin susceptibility @xmath58 .",
    "noninteracting electrons lead to the curve ( c ) , obtained from the lindhard function .",
    "electron interactions modify the shape of this curve and can in principle lead to any of the curves ( a)(e ) .",
    "ferromagnetic order is unstable in cases ( a ) and ( b ) where the magnon dispersion would become negative ; a helical magnetic order becomes here possible .",
    "nuclear magnetism is unstable in case ( c ) , which has a continuum of excitations with zero energy .",
    "a nuclear ferromagnet is stable for cases ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "[ fig : omega ] ]",
    "interactions and correlations between particles become increasingly important in low dimensions due to a reduction of the available phase space for particle scattering .",
    "it is not too surprising , therefore , that electron - electron interactions in the 2deg lead to deviations from the thermodynamics of standard fermi liquids .",
    "such deviations have attracted some attention over the last years theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "of specific importance for our case are refs .",
    "@xcite , where explicitly self - energy corrections to the susceptibility were calculated for a screened coulomb interaction @xmath84 in 2d .",
    "nonanalytic behavior appears at second order perturbation in @xmath85 and leads to @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the bare @xmath63 backscattering vertex and @xmath88 the effective mass .",
    "we emphasize the nonanalytic behavior on the modulus @xmath89 , which can not be derived within a standard fermi liquid theory .",
    "this linear @xmath90 dependence is indeed the necessary dependence for a nuclear ferromagnet as discussed above .",
    "the problem here is , however , the sign of this correction : if we feed this @xmath58 back into the spin wave spectrum , we see that @xmath59 becomes _ negative _ for @xmath91 , meaning that the assumption of ferromagnetic order is incorrect and that such an order is in fact unstable . in such a situation a different , helical order can be possible , and this interesting possibility is discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we focus instead on a further renormalization of the nonanalytic correction , which can reestablish the ferromagnetic order .",
    "we restate the comment made at the beginning of this section that correlation effects are important in low dimensions . a result from perturbation theory , such as eq . , undergoes further renormalization by higher order processes and can so change considerably its shape .",
    "this indeed can happen if we push further the diagrammatic calculation of @xcite and include the full summation of selected classes of diagrams such as , for instance , the cooper channel renormalization of the two - particle scattering vertex @xcite .",
    "the cooper channel renormalization for @xmath92 has been considered recently in @xcite .",
    "the effect of this renormalization on @xmath58 has been estimated in @xcite and very recently explicitly calculated in @xcite .",
    "the obtained corrections to @xmath58 are nonuniversal and depend on detailed cutoff scales of the renormalization such as fermi energy , temperature , level spacing , etc .",
    "the stability of the ferromagnetic ( or helical ) phase seems , therefore , to depend on a quantity which is difficult to control .",
    "yet we must note that this is the result of a perturbative renormalization , the summation over selected classes of diagrams , as well as the result of a screened short ranged electron - electron interaction .",
    "alternative approaches lead to more predictable results : if we consider long ranged coulomb interactions within a local field factor approximation ( which is a semi - empiric generalization of the rpa approximation @xcite ) , the spin wave spectrum is always positive and a ferromagnet is stable .",
    "such effective theories , however , have eventually the same difficulty of control as the summation over classes of diagrams . due to this",
    ", it seems so far that the final determination of the shape of the susceptibility probably has to rely on experiments and numerics .",
    "the latter two approaches should then probe not only the slope @xmath93 at @xmath94 but also @xmath95 , which is important to discriminate between the different scenarios shown in fig . [ fig : omega ] by the curves ( a ) and ( b ) on the one hand , and by ( e ) and ( f ) on the other hand . we stress that numerics should directly target @xmath58 and not , as for instance done in @xcite , the local field factor .",
    "the relation between the latter and @xmath58 is actually singular at @xmath96 , which amplifies the noise in the monte carlo data of @xcite and makes a conclusion on @xmath58 unreliable .    assuming , however , that we have found a window in which a nuclear ferromagnet is stable",
    ", we can estimate @xmath77 from the different calculation schemes .",
    "a detailed discussion is given in @xcite .",
    "we find that remarkably all schemes provide comparable values .",
    "as anticipated much depends on the strength of the electron interactions , which can be quantified by the commonly used dimensionless parameter @xmath97 ( see e.g. @xcite ) expressing roughly the ratio of coulomb over kinetic energies of the electrons . in the 2deg @xmath97 scales with the electron density @xmath98 and @xmath54 as @xmath99 .",
    "values up to @xmath100 can be reached experimentally nowadays . with increasing @xmath97 , the scale @xmath77 is enhanced through two main effects : first",
    ", @xmath101 increases linearly with @xmath97 .",
    "second , @xmath102 , which is essentially the pauli susceptibility at small @xmath97 , increases linearly with @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "we moreover note that larger @xmath97 drive the system closer to the ferromagnetic stoner instability , which would occur at @xmath103 @xcite . at this instability",
    "@xmath104 would diverge .",
    "the proximity to the instability provides an additional prefactor enhancing @xmath102 .",
    "let us note that the increase of @xmath102 enhances both , @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath105 , we then obtain @xmath106 mk , and for @xmath100 the larger @xmath107 mk , where the spread is due to the different analytic approaches @xcite .",
    "with a further reduction of dimensionality electron - electron correlations become even more important .",
    "one - dimensional conductors of interacting electrons , such as quantum wires or carbon nanotubes , form a luttinger liquid rather than a fermi liquid . accordingly",
    "the shape of the rkky interaction @xmath57 between the nuclear spins in these systems changes drastically .",
    "@xmath57 is dominated by backscattering processes at @xmath108 , and the nuclear spins order in a helical phase with this wave vector .",
    "in contrast to the 2d case , the feedback of the ordered nuclear field on the electrons is now crucial .",
    "it leads to a spontaneous restructuring of the electron wave functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , to an order in the electron system as well",
    ". the feedback stabilizes this order , and the critical temperature @xmath66 can increase by several orders of magnitude compared with the case where the feedback has been neglected .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of this effect in @xcite for the example of single - wall carbon nanotubes made from the @xmath109c isotope ( which has a nuclear spin @xmath110 ) .",
    "such nanotubes have become available very recently @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine interaction is very weak in such systems .",
    "due to the feedback , however , we determine a @xmath66 in the millikelvin range .",
    "the ordered phase leads furthermore to a universal reduction of the conductance and should be detectable by standard transport measurements .",
    "we have discussed here the conditions necessary for ferromagnetism of nuclear spins embedded in a 2deg . such a system is naturally in the rkky regime and the interaction between the nuclear spins",
    "is carried by the electron spin susceptibility .",
    "electron correlations are crucial , and the stability of the magnetic ( ferro or different ) phase depends on the nonanalytic behavior , linear in momentum @xmath90 , of the electron spin susceptibility .",
    "the nonanalytic behavior can not be found from standard fermi liquid theory .",
    "it is a consequence of a strong renormalization of the electron - electron interaction which , to the best of our knowledge , strongly depends on a nonuniversal cutoff scale specific for the sample under investigation . the stronger the interaction , however , the higher also the critical temperature for the nuclear ( ferro)magnet .",
    "our estimates show that a transition temperature reaching up into the millikelvin range may be achievable .",
    "a similar temperature range is estimated for one - dimensional conductors such as the recently available @xmath109c single - wall nanotubes , where the ordered phase should be detectable by conductance measurements .    to conclude",
    ", we stress that such physics is not restricted to nuclear spins in metals .",
