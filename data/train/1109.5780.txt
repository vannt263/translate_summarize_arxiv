    "the mean magnitudes and color of the bsgs obtained by @xcite are @xmath97 mag , @xmath163 mag , and @xmath164 mag , and those of the rsgs obtained by @xcite are @xmath165 mag , @xmath166 mag , and @xmath167 mag .",
    "all the magnitudes obtained in our study are @xmath168 mag fainter than those of @xcite , while the situation is different for the @xmath111 color : the mean @xmath111 color for the bsgs obtained in our study is 0.32 mag redder than that of @xcite , while that for the rsgs is 0.24 mag bluer than that of @xcite . it could be possible that there occurs larger absorption in the central part of ngc 1156 , which affects more for the bsgs than the rsgs",
    "nevertheless , since we accurately estimated the reddening value in the central part of the galaxy and applied it in determining the distance , the distance values obtained in this study are not affected much by the differences of reddening values in our study and in the study of @xcite .",
    "all the studies performed in the 1990s , including those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , used the @xmath169 color to select both bsgs and rsgs .",
    "the wide use of ccds since then have produced colors using longer wavelengths such as @xmath111 thanks to the good sensitivities of ccd detectors at these wavebands .",
    "it might be helpful if we could use this @xmath111 color in selecting or investigating the rsgs rather than the @xmath169 color .",
    "using the @xmath111 colors for the rsgs assembled in @xcite together with those for ngc 1156 selected in this study , we plot the @xmath64 and @xmath65 cmds in figure 8 to show the @xmath111 color distribution of the rsgs .",
    "while many rsgs are gathered near @xmath66 mag , the whole color range of the rsgs is @xmath170 mag .",
    "figure 7 shows that among the three selected rsgs , rsg2 is bluest both in @xmath169 and @xmath111 colors .",
    "the @xmath111 color of this star ( @xmath171 mag ) is almost at the blue edge in the color range shown in figure 8 .",
    "if we ignore this star and select again three rsgs in figure 7(c ) , the somewhat fainter and redder star with @xmath172 mag and @xmath173 mag will be chosen , and this does not much affect the resultant distance estimate to ngc 1156 .",
    "using the @xmath27 archive @xmath1 acs / hrc images of the dirr galaxy ngc 1156 , we performed dolphot photometry , constructed various combinations of cmds , and estimated the total ( foreground @xmath3 internal ) reddening and distance to this galaxy .",
    "although the cmds are not deep enough to detect the trgb due to the short exposure times of the @xmath1 images , they are good enough to draw a @xmath2 color - color diagram to determine the total interstellar reddening of @xmath4 mag and to select the three bsgs and three rsgs , which allowed us to determine the distance to this galaxy , @xmath13 mpc ( @xmath12 mag ) .",
    "the cmds obtained in this study are quite similar to those of ngc 6822 @xcite ( figure 15 , @xmath61 cmd and figure 17 , @xmath65 cmd ) , ngc 3109 @xcite ( figure 2 , @xmath65 and @xmath64 cmds ) , wlm @xcite ( figure 5 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 cmds ) , and/or ic 1613 @xcite ( figure 4 , @xmath61 cmd and figure 5 , @xmath65 cmd ) .",
    "since ngc 1156 is located much farther than these late - type dwarf galaxies , it is necessary to get deeper imaging of ngc 1156 to obtain deep enough photometry so that we can estimate the distance more reliably using the trgb method or perform a detailed study of the stellar populations of this galaxy .",

    "<S> we present a photometric estimation of the distance and reddening values to the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 1156 , which is one of the best targets to study the isolated dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the imaging data sets of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the central region of ngc 1156 ( @xmath0 ) available in the @xmath1 archive for this study . from the @xmath2 color - color diagram , we first estimate the total ( foreground @xmath3 internal ) reddening toward ngc 1156 of @xmath4 mag , whereas only the foreground reddening was previously known to be @xmath5 mag ( burstein & heiles ) or 0.24 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ) . based on the brightest stars method , selecting the three brightest blue supergiant ( bsg ) stars with mean @xmath6 magnitude of @xmath7 mag and the three brightest red supergiant ( rsg ) stars with mean @xmath8 magnitude of @xmath9 mag , we derive the distance modulus to ngc 1156 to be @xmath10 mag and @xmath11 mag . by using weights of 1 and 1.5 for the distance moduli from using the bsgs and the rsgs , respectively , we finally obtain the weighted mean distance modulus to ngc 1156 @xmath12 mag ( @xmath13 mpc ) , which is in very good agreement with the previous estimates . combining the photometry data of this study with those of karachentsev et al . </S>",
