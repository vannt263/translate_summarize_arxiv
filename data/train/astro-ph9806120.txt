    "the current trend in cosmology is to explore the properties of galaxies at ever fainter limits .",
    "this has lead to demonstration of the existence of a substantial galaxy population at @xmath2 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 , metcalfe et al .",
    "1996 , steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the discovery of galaxy clusters with @xmath3 ( deltorn et al .",
    "1997 , stanford et al .",
    "1997 , yamada et al .",
    "these discoveries have allowed us to extend our knowledge of the formation history of galaxies ( madau et al .",
    "1996 , baugh et al .",
    "1998 , kodama et al .  1998 ) and the growth of the universe s gravitational structure ( bower & smail 1997 ) . however , while images that reach these depths are now relatively commonplace , spectroscopic follow - up of these objects is extremely time consuming even on 8m - class telescopes .",
    "these problems are offset by the multiplex capability of multi - object spectrographs ( eg .",
    "ldss ; allington - smith et al .",
    "1994 ) and fibre - optic fed spectrographs ( eg . taylor 1995 ) , or by surveys targeted at specific redshifts using tuneable narrow - band filters ( eg . jones & bland - hawthorn 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , even in the best studied deep images , only a small fraction of the galaxies have known spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "whereas spectroscopic redshifts use sharp absorption and/or emission lines to accurately determine the rest wavelength of the spectrum , it is also possible to exploit the overall characteristic shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to estimate the galaxy s redshift .",
    "this ` photometric redshift ' approach can be applied to broad band images provided they have sufficiently high signal to noise and adequately sample the important features of the sed .",
    "in particular , the 4000   spectral break and the balmer and lyman series limits are important features that arise in almost all galaxy spectra . although precise redshifts can not be determined by this method , estimates of ( or limits on ) @xmath4 are obtained .",
    "the existing photometric redshift estimators fall into three main classes : empirical redshift estimators , those based on observed spectral energy distributions and model - based redshift estimators . empirical redshift estimators ( connolly et al .",
    "1995 ) are based on a training set of galaxies for which the redshifts and broad - band fluxes are known .",
    "these are used to train an estimator , for example a multi - dimensional polynomial fit , that predicts the redshift from the input fluxes with minimum error .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that it requires a relatively large training dataset with high quality colours and known redshifts .",
    "this makes it difficult to apply beyond the limits of spectroscopic surveys , although this problem might be alleviated using the colours of distant , gravitationally lensed galaxies .",
    "however this method , when tested against independent but similar data , can give impressive accuracy ( @xmath5@xmath60.06 ; connolly et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "lanzetta et al .  (",
    "1996 ) , mobasher et al .  ( 1996 ) and sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) use an approach that is based on the observed seds of galaxies covering a wide range of spectral types .",
    "redshifts are estimated from the observed data by redshifting each of the templates and determining the best match to the observational colours .",
    "they emphasise the importance of using observed templates in order to incorporate the effects of dust .",
    "this is particularly important for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath7 because the optical colours increasingly reflect the rest frame ultraviolet spectrum of the galaxy .",
    "one problem with this approach , however , is that the spectral library does not take into account the evolution of the galaxy stellar populations .",
    "the method can accommodate evolution in as far as it is equivalent to changing galaxies between different spectral types , however .",
    "model - based approaches use stellar population synthesis codes ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) to produce model seds that can then be compared to the observed data .",
    "for example , gwyn & hartwick ( 1996 ) used a spread of galaxy models from single burst stellar populations to models with constant star formation to model present - day galaxies . when generating redshifted model seds , the evolution of the stellar population is automatically taken into account .",
    "the redshift of the observed galaxy is determined by minimising @xmath8 residuals .",
    "the improved flexibility of this method can however , lead to greater errors in the estimated redshifts .",
    "this arises because of colour degenaracies between the effects of galaxy type and redshift .    in this paper",
    ", we focus more closely on the interrelation between star formation history and redshift estimation .",
    "as we have outlined , photometric redshifts can be susceptible to changes in the galaxy stellar population . for instance , the effects of age , metal abundance and on - going star formation are all reflected in the relative shape of the continuum , particularly when it is convolved with the response of standard broad band filters .",
    "it is important that these uncertainties are taken into account when determining the galaxy redshift .",
    "we develop a method of photometric redshift determination that explicitly takes into account the degeneracies implied by these variations . clearly , incorporating additional free parameters to describe the star formation history of the galaxy threatens to make it impossible to extract useful redshift information .",
    "however , many of the changes in colour caused by different star formation histories are degenerate : this is the familiar age - metallicity degeneracy that has long plagued the estimation of star formation histories in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we will show that for red galaxies , redshifts can be determined under only weak assumptions about the star formation history . at lower redshifts , the colours of blue ( disk )",
    "galaxies become considerably harder to disentangle .",
    "our approach attempts to deal with , and indeed embrace , this unavoidable degeneracy in colours with variations in redshift and star formation history",
    ". we explicitly account for galaxy metallicities and star formation histories ; these effects are in many cases degenerate with uncertainties due to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , recent star formation , dust extinction and cosmology .",
    "we retain possible degeneracies in plausible values of galaxy type and redshift by storing a ` probability map ' for each galaxy , which can be used to estimate a range of acceptable redshifts rather than reducing the observed data to a single ` best bet ' estimate of galaxy type and redshift .",
    "in particular , our classifier is designed to pick out galaxy cluster members without biasing the sample to galaxies of one particular star formation history .",
    "our motivation is to use this method to study the _ photometric _ properties of @xmath9 cluster galaxies with as little selection bias as possible .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . ",
    "2 introduces the stellar population synthesis code of kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "we derive colour tracks for a range of galaxy star formation histories and outline the major uncertainties in these tracks .",
    "this provides the framework for selecting appropriate filter sets and required photometric accuracy . ",
    "3 details our bayesian approach to the inversion problem .",
    "we explicitly incorporate a wide variety of possible star formation histories , and explicitly incorporate the resulting degeneracies in our redshift estimates .",
    "the role of the prior is discussed . in   4 , we test our method with galaxies in abell  370 cluster field and galaxies with known redshifts in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) . ",
    "5 gives an application of the method to a simulated cluster at @xmath10 .",
    "a summary and our conclusions are presented in ",
    "the evolutionary population synthesis model of kodama ( 1997 ) was used to predict the photometric properties of evolving stellar populations .",
    "this model calculates the spectral evolution of a galaxy with an arbitrary star formation history , taking into account the chemical evolution in a self - consistent way .",
    "kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) applied this model to the elliptical galaxy populations of distant clusters . in this study ,",
    "disk models with ongoing star formation are considered in addition to the elliptical models .",
    "we first describe the basic equations and parameters of this model and then summarise the elliptical galaxy and disk galaxy models .",
    "we assume that the galactic gas is supplied from a surrounding gas reservoir trapped in the gravitational potential of a galaxy and that the gas is always well - mixed and distributes uniformly in a galaxy .",
    "the star formation is described by the following equations .",
    "the stellar imf is given by a single power law : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are lower and upper limits of initial stellar mass respectively .",
    "the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath15 is determined by , @xmath16 the imf is assumed to be time invariant .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath17 is assumed to be proportional to the gas mass @xmath18 ( schmidt 1959 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the star formation time scale in gyr . note that this formulation gives an exponentially decaying sfr with an effective time scale @xmath21 in the case of the simple models , where @xmath22 is the so - called locked - up mass fraction defined by tinsley ( 1980 ) .",
    "the salpeter mass function ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 , @xmath25 m@xmath26 gives @xmath27 .",
    "the gas infall rate @xmath28 depends on the initial total mass of the gas reservoir @xmath29 and the gas infall time scale @xmath30 : @xmath31 ( kppen & arimoto 1990 ) .",
    "the gas metallicity @xmath32 is calculated numerically , using the basic equations of chemical evolution ( tinsley 1980 ) and stellar nucleosynthesis tables ( nomoto 1993 ) .",
    "the metal contribution from snia is also considered by fixing their lifetime at 1.5 gyr .",
    "we assume that the metal - enriched gas spreads through the galaxy instantaneously and evenly ( the one - zone approximation ) . as the initial conditions ,",
    "we assume that there is no gas in a galaxy before the onset of star formation ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "using the infall history defined as above , our expression for the star formation rate @xmath17 and the metallicity of the stars @xmath35 , the integrated spectrum of a galaxy can be synthesised as a function of time . by specifying the galaxy age , or equivalently its formation redshift , and cosmological parameters",
    ", we obtain the spectra and therefore colour indices of the galaxy as a function of redshift .",
    "the cosmological parameters are set to @xmath36 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 unless otherwise stated .      for elliptical galaxy models ( e models ) , we use @xmath40 , @xmath41 m@xmath26 , and",
    "@xmath42 m@xmath26 for the imf and short time scales of star formation and gas infall : @xmath43 gyr .",
    "the slope of the imf differs from the salpeter value @xmath23 to allow the colours of the reddest giant ellipticals to be reproduced in the context of this model ( with a salpeter imf , metallicities high enough can not be achieved ) . in addition , in order to reproduce the observed present - day dependence of elliptical galaxy colour on luminosity , it is useful to introduce another parameter , the galactic wind epoch @xmath44 . at this time",
    ", the energy put into the ism in the proto - elliptical galaxy by sne is large enough to overcome the potential of the galaxy , resulting in the ejection of the gas from the galaxy , ending star formation .",
    "we constructed a model sequence of elliptical galaxies as a function of total luminosity by simply changing @xmath44 so that they reproduce the colour - magnitude ( _ c - m _ ) relation of coma ellipticals in @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992a , b ) at the galaxy age @xmath4712 gyr .",
    "changing @xmath44 is equivalent to adjusting the mean stellar metallicity of the galaxies , therefore we call this the _ metallicity sequence _ of elliptical galaxy models . in this model ,",
    "the mean stellar metallicity @xmath48[m / h]@xmath49 changes from 0.06 to @xmath500.52 over a six magnitude range from the brightest e model ( @xmath51 mag at @xmath52 ) .",
    "the time until the onset of a galactic wind @xmath44 is always shorter than @xmath60.5 gyr , thus the star formation in elliptical galaxies is burst - like .",
    "the above model sequence is shown to reproduce the evolution of the _ c - m _ relation of elliptical galaxies in distant clusters in kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) and kodama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    to represent the photometric properties of disk galaxy bulges , we borrow the elliptical galaxy models .",
    "observational support for this includes the results of mg@xmath53 index analysis ( jablonka , martin , & arimoto 1996 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  [ tab : band2 ] , we summarise the effect of passband choice on the estimated redshift error .",
    "photometric errors of 0.071 mag are assumed in all passbands .",
    "two cases in particular are found to be ideal : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the redshift errors are always well below 0.1 regardless of galaxy type , and hence the number of galaxies dropped out of our cluster sample , and the field contamination , are minimised .",
    "it is encouraging that we can do comparably well without @xmath56-band , as it is good to minimise the use of passbands shortwards of rest frame 2500   where possible .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath57 and @xmath58 work comparably well , although @xmath59 is larger , especially for galaxies with ongoing star formation .",
    "this is because it becomes difficult to separate the effects of changes in stellar population and those of changing redshift .",
    "if both @xmath56 and @xmath60-band are missing ( and we have @xmath61 only ) , we tend to underestimate the redshift of bluer galaxies .",
    "this is analogous to lacking @xmath62-band for abell 370 : it becomes difficult to disentangle galaxy type and redshift without the uv colours for star forming galaxies .",
    "for the early type galaxies , however , the redshift errors are reasonable , as we would expect from fig . [",
    "fig : twocolour ] .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath63 band is missing , the errors in the redshift estimation become much larger , irrespective of galaxy type , as there is no passband longwards of the rest - frame 4000   break . in this context",
    ", it is crucial for high redshift work to have both optical and near infrared passbands for accurate redshift estimation .",
    "we present a new photometric redshift estimator , which is optimised for the identification and study of galaxy clusters at high redshifts .",
    "we use only several broad passbands covering the 4000   break , and find in practice that it is possible to avoid the use of the uncertain colours shortwards of rest frame 2500   . in our models , we considered as wide a variety of stellar populations as is possible to minimise the selection bias in the recovered cluster members .",
    "as most of the effects of changing stellar population on the integrated colours are highly degenerate , we find that it is possible to estimate redshifts with reasonable accuracy for a range of galaxy types , ranging from those with old , passively evolving stellar populations , through to those with younger stellar populations and on - going star formation .",
    "following the success in testing our method with data from abell  370 and from the hubble deep field , we applied it to a simulated cluster at @xmath10 .",
    "we have shown that the estimation of redshifts with accuracies better than @xmath64 can be achieved with multi - passband photometry of moderate quality ( @xmath65 0.1 mag ) in a small number of passbands , and the cluster members can be reliably identified . therefore , the recovery of the _ c - m _ relation both in terms of the slope and scatter is expected to be accurate and almost free from any selection bias .",
    "we now have a means of analysing the _ photometric _ properties of cluster galaxies at very high redshifts without a thorough spectroscopic membership confirmation .",

    "we are also grateful to the anonymous referee who gave us many constructive comments .",
