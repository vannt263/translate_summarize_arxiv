    "( 2006 ; dashed line ) . clearly , a better constraint is needed by extending the study to the fainter limit , and placing more constraints on the extinction within high - redshift galaxies .",
    "our sfr density at @xmath0 does not include the contribution from the uv - faint population that can not be selected using lyman break technique , such as drgs or submm galaxies .",
    "the contribution of massive galaxies to the star formation at @xmath130 can go up even more if we include the contribution from the galaxies that are heavily extinguished by dust .",
    "the number density of submm galaxies is very small , @xmath131 at @xmath132 ( tecza et al .",
    "although there might be an overlap of order of 50% between lbgs and submm galaxies ( e.g. , chapman et al . 2005 ) , the submm galaxies can have star formation rates as large as 1000 @xmath74 , therefore their sfr density can be almost comparable to the sfr density of massive lbgs . the contribution of drgs is rather difficult to estimate .",
    "frster - schreiber et al.(2004 ) suggested that the median value of the star formation rate for drgs in hdf - s is 120 @xmath74 , and their number density is about an order of magnitude greater than submm galaxies ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2006 ) . from the above fact",
    ", one might argue that the sfr density of drg is comparable to that of massive lbgs , but such an argument is not valid since these two populations overlap with each other as mentioned in section 5.2.2 .    in any case , our result suggests that the star formation activity in massive galaxies is a dominant process at @xmath130 compared to the universe at @xmath133 , supporting the downsizing picture of the galaxy formation .",
    "we have selected and studied lbgs at @xmath0 in the _ spitzer _ first look survey area , using the multi - wavelength datasets consisting of deep @xmath134 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56-band and the _ spitzer _ irac and mips images . in total , we have found 1088 lbgs with @xmath13524.5 mag over the @xmath1 deg@xmath2 area .",
    "the wide area coverage enables us to select a large number of bright lbgs with mir fluxes which are important for studying various properties of rare , massive lbgs .    particularly , we concentrated on the properties of lbgs detected in irac 3.6@xmath3 m over 3@xmath42 ( 6@xmath3jy in verification strip , 12@xmath3jy in main field ) .",
    "these `` irac lbgs '' are on average massive / old / infrared sub - population of whole lbgs .",
    "nearly @xmath136% of irac lbgs are more massive than @xmath102 .",
    "irac lbgs with the largest stellar mass have the reddest ( optical - mir ) color , which is indicative of old stellar population",
    ". @xmath8 ratio of the galaxies dominated by old stellar population is constant with little scatter . on the other hand , irac lbgs with large ongoing star formation increase the scatter in @xmath8 .    among these irac lbgs ,",
    "12 lbgs were detected in 24 @xmath3 m image .",
    "the infrared luminosity of the lbgs with individual 24 @xmath3 m detection suggests a high star formation rate of @xmath137 occurring in these systems .",
    "the @xmath71 of lbgs , indicating the amount of dust extinction within the uncertainty of a factor of a few , has weak but existing correlation with the stellar mass .",
    "dustier lbgs are more massive , and this again ensures we see the massive / infrared end of lbg population in the irac lbgs .    with the photometric redshifts of the lbgs",
    ", the rest - frame uv luminosity function is constructed .",
    "the derived luminosity function is consistent with previous studies , but with a much improved number statistics .",
    "we also construct the uv luminosity function of massive lbgs ( @xmath30 ) , from which we estimate the sfr density in massive systems at high redshift .",
    "the star formation rate density from all lbgs at @xmath0 , calculated in the survey magnitude interval , is @xmath118 , while the star formation rate density from massive lbgs is @xmath138 .",
    "the contribution of the massive systems to the global star formation at @xmath0 is significantly large compared to the case of lower redshifts .",
    "this finding suggests that the shift of star formation activity from massive systems to the smaller systems as the universe ages , interpreted as known `` downsizing '' of the galaxy formation and evolution .",
