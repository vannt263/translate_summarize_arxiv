    "the resulting high - energy gamma - ray emission of the sun has already been detected by egret ( orlando & strong 2008 ) and fermi ( abdo a. a. et al 2011 ) at photon energies @xmath1mev .",
    "the sun might be detectable even at @xmath2gev energies ( weiner et al 2013 ) .",
    "the inverse compton gamma rays probe the near - sun ( phase - space ) density of the cosmic - ray electrons and positrons .",
    "this density should have a non - trivial morphology . here",
    "we note that the very existence of the compton drag allows to calculate the near - sun density of the high - energy electrons and positrons without any cosmic ray diffusion model .",
    "given the solar magnetic field , the density of @xmath3gev electrons can be calculated just by a brute - force first - principle monte - carlo .",
    "one isotropically illuminates the sun ( from about ten solar radii is good enough ) and calculates the numerically - exact trajectories .",
    "the result of the monte - carlo calculation is shown in fig.1 for a pure - dipole magnetic field . to model the compton drag , we removed the particles with a radius - dependent mean - free path @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radius of the sun and @xmath6 is the spherical radius . for @xmath7 .",
    "the bound orbits are not really populated by the particles coming from afar , because of a nearly perfect conservation , at small radii @xmath6 , of the adiabatic invariant @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the momentum component perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath10 . ]    to be clear , fig.1 is a totally unrealistic toy model of the actual density around the sun . in particular , for a pure dipole field , it does not make sense to discuss how the shape and size of the belt scale with the electron energy .",
    "is determined by the breaking of the adiabatic invariant : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electron energy .",
    "the belt boundary is parallel to the field line : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the polar angle . ]",
    "the dipole approximation in never accurate , and must become totally misleading already at a few solar radii .",
    "but fig.1 does correctly show that the quasi - bound orbits are practically empty , because the compton drag depopulates these orbits faster than they are populated by the incoming electrons .",
    "even if the solar field is not usefully approximated by the dipole , some magnetic field lines surely do emanate and terminate at the solar surface . in the vicinity of such field lines",
    "there will be some quasi - bound orbits , and these orbits are going to be empty .",
