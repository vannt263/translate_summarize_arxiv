    "the response of physical systems to a change of external conditions is of eminent importance in physics .",
    "in particular the dependence of expectation values on temperature , the particle density , the space region , the imposed boundary conditions or external fields has been widely studied @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many properties of such systems are poorly understood .",
    "the massless thirring model @xcite , which is among the simplest interacting field theories , has already led to considerable confusion about its thermodynamic properties in the literature @xcite .",
    "the reason is two - fold : firstly , the computation of the fermionic determinant in the presence of a chemical potential and/or non - trivial boundary conditions is delicate , because the eigenvalues of the dirac operator are generically complex . in section",
    "@xmath4 we propose a regularization scheme via analytic continuation .",
    "we argue that the so - obtained determinant , which differs from previous results @xcite , leads to the correct equation of state.the second complication originates in the infrared - sector .",
    "an elegant infrared regularization , which is particularly well suited for the study of thermodynamic properties , is to quantize the model on a torus .",
    "harmonic contributions to the current arise then naturally and taking them into account turns out to be crucial for a correct quantization . in particular",
    "the so - obtained results differ from those gotten earlier @xcite using bosonization .",
    "this is explained in section @xmath5 .    on another front",
    "there has been much effort to quantize self - interacting field theories in a background gravitational field @xcite .",
    "for example , one is interested whether a black hole still emits thermal radiation when self - interaction is included . due to general arguments by gibbons and perry @xcite this question",
    "is intimately connected with the universality of the second law of thermodynamics . the thirring model ( including the gauged version of it )",
    "is still solvable in curved space - time and we can study its properties in a background gravitational field .",
    "this provides us in particular with an elegant approach to the study of its conformal structure : correlation functions with current- and stress - tensor insertions , which are gotten by functional differentiation with respect to the gauge- and gravitational fields , contain the necessary information to characterize the underlying symmetry algebras . to familiarize the reader with our approach",
    "we first rederive the conformal structure of the original thirring model in section @xmath6 .",
    "we then show how a non - minimal coupling to gravity leads in a natural way to a modification of the conformal structure .",
    "in particular , very much as for a free scalar field the central charge in the fermionic formulation of the thirring model is not unique .",
    "furthermore , we find that the equivalence between finite size scaling and central charge of the virasoro algebra holds only for a particular treatment of the zero - mode sector in which a charge at infinity is generated automatically .",
    "this charge combines in a non - trivial way with the weyl - anomaly of the determinant of the fluctuation operators to reconcile the equivalence of the finite size scaling and the central charge . for certain values of the non - minimal coupling",
    "we obtain minimal models from interacting fermions .",
    "this is the subject of sections 3.4 and 3.5 .    the gauged thirring model , which contains the schwinger model ( @xmath7 ) as a particular limit , is no longer conformally invariant but has a mass gap : the photon acquires a mass @xmath8 via the schwinger mechanism .",
    "it possesses a non - trivial vacuum structure which promotes it to an attractive toy model to mimic the complex vacuum structure in @xmath9-d gauge theories . from our experience with the schwinger model @xcite , which is supposed to share certain aspects with one - flavour @xmath10 @xcite",
    ", we expect that gauge fields with winding numbers are responsible for the non - vanishing chiral condensate and in particular its temperature dependence .",
    "configurations with windings , so called instantons , exist only for finite volumes and minimize the euclidean action .",
    "they lead to chirality violating vacuum expectation values .",
    "for example , a non - zero chiral condensate develops which only for high temperature and large curvature vanishes exponentially .    since for particular choices of the coupling constants the model reduces to well known and well studied exactly soluble models there are many earlier works which are related to ours .",
    "some of them concentrated more on the gauge sector and investigated the renormalization of the electric charge by the four - fermi interaction @xcite or the non - trivial vacuum structure in the schwinger model @xcite .",
    "others concentrated on the un - gauged conformal sector .",
    "freedman and pilch calculated the partition function of the un - gauged thirring model on arbitrary riemann surfaces @xcite .",
    "we do not agree with their result and in particular show that there is no holomorphic factorization for general fermionic boundary conditions .",
    "also we deviate from destri and devega @xcite which investigated the un - gauged model on the cylinder with twisted boundary conditions .",
    "we comment on these discrepancies in section @xmath5.section @xmath11 contains introductory material and in particular the classical structure of the model .",
    "other papers are dealing with different aspects of certain limiting cases of the model considered here .",
    "in particular in @xcite , the thermodynamics of the thirring model has been studied and the hawking radiation has been derived in @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the massive thirring model and the sine - gordon model in curved space has been shown in @xcite .",
    "partition functions for scalar fields with twisted boundary conditions have been computed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "the gauged thirring model in curved space - time has the lagrangian    where the gamma - matrices in curved space - time are related to the ones in minkowski space - time as @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the coordinate- and gauge covariant derivative and @xmath14 is the electromagnetic field strength . the gravitational field @xmath15 ( or rather the @xmath11-bein @xmath16 , since the theory contains fermions ) is treated as classical background field , whereas the photons @xmath17 and fermions @xmath18 will be quantized .",
    "the classical theory is invariant under @xmath19 gauge- and axial transformations and correspondingly possesses conserved vector and axial - vector currents    here @xmath20 denotes the totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "in fact , the conservation laws together with the relation ( [ t3 ] ) between the vector- and axial currents imply that the currents are free fields    which is the reason that accounts for the solubility of the model @xcite , even in the presence of gauge- and gravitational fields .",
    "of course , for any gauge invariant regularization the axial current possesses an anomalous divergence in the quantized model .",
    "thus the normal @xmath21 ward identities in the un - gauged thirring model @xcite become anomalous when the fermions couple to a gauge field .",
    "the solution of the equations of motion is most easily presented by introducing auxiliary scalar- and pseudo - scalar fields , in terms of which the action takes the form    note that for later use we have allowed for different couplings of the fermionic currents to the scalar- and pseudo - scalar auxiliary fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the original thirring model is recovered for @xmath24 , since then    is classically and quantum - mechanically equivalent to ( [ t13 ] ) , after elimination of the multiplier field @xmath25 .    by decomposing the gauge field similarly as the @xmath25-field as    and choosing isothermal coordinates for which @xmath26 , the generalized dirac operator reads    hence , if @xmath27 solves the free dirac equation in flat minkowski space time",
    ", then    solves the dirac equation of the interacting theory on curved space - time .",
    "the vector currents are related as @xmath28 the same relation holds for the axial vector current .",

    "the momentum densities @xmath37 conjugate to the @xmath38-fields are given by functional left - derivatives .",
    "a simple calculation yields the following momenta @xmath39    in the following sections we are lead to consider the _ euclidean version _ of the model .",
    "then one must replace the lorentzian @xmath40 and @xmath41 by their euclidean counterparts .",
    "for example , with our conventions the relation ( [ t3 ] ) becomes @xmath42 and the generalized dirac operator in euclidean space - time becomes    ( see ( [ t5 ] ) for the definition of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , instead of ( [ t5 ] ) .",
    "also , to recover the euclidean thirring model as particular limit of ( [ t1 ] ) we must set @xmath45 .",
    "in this section we analyze the quantum theory corresponding to the classical action ( [ t1 ] ) without gauge fields , in flat and curved space - time .",
    "the gauged model is then considered in the next section . here",
    "we calculate the _ partition function , ground state energy , equation of state _ and determine the _ conformal structure _ of the un - gauged model .    to allow for a non - vanishing u(1)-charge we couple this",
    "conserved charge to a chemical potential @xmath46 .",
    "for the finite temperature model the imaginary time must vary from zero to the inverse temperature @xmath47 and the bosonic and fermionic fields must obey periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "we enclose the system in a spatial box with length @xmath48 to avoid infrared divergences .",
    "we shall determine the dependence of the partition function and correlators on the metric .",
    "this provides us with an alternative approach to the conformal structure and its relation to finite size - effects .",
    "also , it enables us to study the effect of non - minimal coupling to gravity in section @xmath6 .",
    "hence we allow for an arbitrary metric or @xmath11-bein @xmath49 with euclidean signature",
    ". we can choose ( quasi ) isothermal coordinates and a lorentz frame such that    where @xmath50 is the teichmueller parameter and @xmath51 the gravitational liouville field .",
    "space - time is then a square of length @xmath48 and has volume @xmath52 .",
    "we allow for the general twisted boundary conditions for the fermions    the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent _ vectorial and chiral twists _ , respectively .",
    "we could allow for twisted boundary conditions for the ( pseudo ) scalars as well @xcite , e.g. @xmath55 .",
    "however , to recover the thirring model for equal couplings we must assume that these fields are periodic .",
    "for @xmath56 , @xmath57 in which case @xmath58 , and for @xmath59 the partition function has the usual thermodynamical interpretation .",
    "its logarithm is proportional to the free energy at temperature @xmath60 .",
    "twisted boundary conditions as in ( [ t518 ] ) require some care in the fermionic path integral .",
    "the subtleties are not related to the unavoidable ultra - violet divergences but to the transition from minkowski- to euclidean space - time . to see that more clearly let @xmath61 denote the space of fermionic fields in _ minkowski space - time _ with chirality @xmath62 . since both the commutation relations and the action do not connect @xmath63 and @xmath64 we can consistently impose different boundary conditions on @xmath63 and @xmath64 . on the other hand , in the _ euclidean path - integral _ for the generating functional    the dirac operator @xmath65 exchanges the two chiral components of @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the situation in minkowski space the two chiral sectors are related in the action . of course , the eigenvalue problem for @xmath67 is then not well defined .",
    "this is the origin of the ambiguity in the definition of the determinant .",
    "it is related to the ambiguities one encounters when one quantizes chiral fermions @xcite .",
    "here we reformulate this problem in such a way that the determinant with chiral twists ( @xmath68 ) can be obtained by analytic continuation .",
    "the resulting determinants do not factorize into ( anti- ) holomorphic pieces . in appendix",
    "b we give further arguments in favour of our result by calculating the determinants in a different way .",
    "let us now study the generating functional for fermions in an external gravitational and auxiliary field .",
    "for that we observe that on the torus we must add a harmonic piece to the auxiliary fields to which the fermionic current couples in ( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , in the hodge - decomposition of @xmath25 in ( [ t1a ] ) contains a harmonic piece ,    more generally , allowing for arbitrary couplings of the various terms in ( [ help ] ) to the fermionic current , we are led to add a term @xmath69 to the action ( [ t1 ] ) .",
    "note , that in isothermal coordinates , for which the metric has the form ( [ t517 ] ) , the harmonics @xmath70 are constant . the constant @xmath70 couple to the harmonic part of the current and",
    "are needed to recover the thirring model in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "also , we shall see that the harmonic degrees of freedom are essential to obtain the correct thermodynamic potential.finally we introduce a _ chemical potential _ for the conserved @xmath19 charge . in the euclidean functional approach",
    "this is equivalent to coupling the fermions to a constant imaginary gauge potential @xmath72 @xcite.as a consequence of the above observations the scaling formula ( [ scal1 ] ) ( recall , that @xmath73 and @xmath74 when the electromagnetic interaction is switched off ) is modified to    this scaling property will enable us to relate the fermionic determinants and green s functions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the spin connection @xmath77 in ( [ t28 ] ) vanishes for our choice of the reference zweibein .",
    "the dependence of @xmath76 on the chemical potential @xmath46 and the constant harmonic field @xmath70 can not be gotten by the anomaly equation @xcite .",
    "it must be computed by direct methods .",
    "for this we expand the fermionic field in a orthonormal basis of the hilbert space    where @xmath78 are independent grassmann variables .",
    "a basis is given by    and the @xmath79 are the eigenvectors of @xmath80 . recall that @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent the vectorial- and chiral twists ( [ t518 ] ) respectively .",
    "the @xmath81 and @xmath82 must obey the @xmath83 and @xmath84 boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "these boundary conditions fix the admissible momenta @xmath85 in ( [ dett30 ] ) .",
    "since the dirac operator maps @xmath86 into @xmath87 the @xmath88 must then obey the same boundary conditions as the @xmath89 .",
    "thus @xmath90 is obtained from @xmath91 by exchanging @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it follows then that    with    here we have introduced @xmath94 . to continue we recast the infinite product for the determinant in the form    where @xmath95 is the inverse of the reference metric ( [ t517 ] ) and    the logarithm of the product ( [ inf ] ) can in turn be written as the derivative at zero argument of a generalized zeta function .",
    "indeed one easily verifies that for    we have ( formally )    however @xmath96 is divergent for @xmath97 .",
    "these divergences can be regularized as follows : we compute @xmath96 for @xmath98 and subsequently define its value for @xmath99 by analytic continuation.assume for the moment that @xmath100 is real or equivalently that there are no chiral twists @xmath101 and chemical potential @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath96 has a well defined analytic continuation to @xmath102 via a poisson resummation @xcite . indeed , writing @xmath96 as a mellin transform    the generalized poisson resummation formula    applied to the integrand in ( [ det5 ] ) yields after integration over @xmath103    the zero mode with @xmath104",
    "is eliminated because for @xmath105 it does not contribute .",
    "after this analytic continuation @xmath96 and @xmath106 are now regular at @xmath107 .",
    "more precisely @xmath108 and    here we made use of @xmath109\\es \\det[(i\\hat\\di)^2]$ ] , which follows from @xmath110.for complex @xmath100 the poisson resummation is not applicable and @xmath111 can not be calculated by direct means . to circumvent these difficulties",
    "we note that the infinite sum ( [ det34 ] ) defining the @xmath112-function for @xmath113 is a mereomorphic function in @xmath114 .",
    "thus we may first continue to @xmath102 for real @xmath100 and then continue the result to complex values . using the transformation properties of theta functions the resulting determinant can be written as    this is the main result of this section.it can be shown that this determinant is _ gauge invariant _ , i.e. invariant under @xmath115 , but not invariant under chiral transformations , @xmath116 , as expected .",
    "furthermore , it transforms covariantly under modular transformations @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in other words",
    ", @xmath119 is invariant under modular transformations if at the same time the boundary conditions are transformed accordingly .",
    "the exponential prefactor is needed for modular covariance and is not present in the literature @xcite .",
    "it correlates the two chiral sectors and will have important consequences . in appendix",
    "b we confirm ( [ t36 ] ) with operator methods .",
    "the last step in the calculation of the fermionic generating functional is the inclusion of the local contributions to the auxiliary- and metric field , i.e. the dependence of the determinant on @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath120 . for this",
    "we introduce the one - parameter family of dirac operators    we take the @xmath121-dependence of the metric as @xmath122 . with @xmath123 as defined in ( [ t28 ] ) , this family interpolates between @xmath76 and @xmath75 .",
    "the determinant of the full dirac operator is then obtained by integrating the corresponding anomaly equation @xcite :    where    is the _ liouville action . _ in deriving this result we assumed that @xmath124 .",
    "this constraint on the zero - mode of @xmath22 ( and similarly of @xmath23 ) will be discussed below .",
    "actually , for our reference metric the ricci scalar @xmath125 vanishes and the liouville action simplifies to @xmath126 .",
    "however , the above formulae hold for arbitrary reference metrics and arbitrary riemannian surfaces . furthermore , as expected for a gauge - invariant regularization , the function @xmath22 and thus the longitudinal part of @xmath25 does not appear in the determinant .    to complete the calculation of the generating functional we need to know the fermionic green - functions @xmath127 .",
    "using the scaling property of the dirac operator , eq .",
    "( [ t539a ] ) , it is easy to see that in an arbitrary background field @xmath127 is related to @xmath128 by @xmath129 together with the relation ( [ t543 ] ) and the explicit form ( [ t35],[t36 ] ) for @xmath119 this yields the fermionic generating functional    by using the scaling properties of the ricci - scalar and laplacian ( see appendix a ) the exponent can be written in a manifest diffeomorphism - invariant way as @xmath130 here we used that on the torus @xmath131 integrates to zero . on the sphere or higher genus surfaces",
    "the last formula is modified.the integration over the auxiliary fields then leads to the full generating functional of the thirring model .",
    "it contains all information about the thermodynamic- and conformal properties .",
    "this is the subject of the next two sections .      in this chapter",
    "we derive the grand canonical potential , equation of state and ground state energy for the thirring model . for this",
    "we need to compute the partition function    where @xmath132 is the fermionic generating functional ( [ t46 ] ) and @xmath133 the bosonic action    as it stands the partition function is still ill - defined unless we constrain the zero - modes artificially introduced in the hodge decomposition of @xmath25 in ( [ help ] ) .",
    "the choice of the constraints is restricted by the symmetries of the system .",
    "in particular translation invariance ( or rotation invariance on the sphere ) and covariance under modular transformations of the torus are symmetries which me may want to preserve by the zero - mode constraint .",
    "the constraint measure    ( and similarly for @xmath134 ) satisfies these requirements ( the normalization by the volume in the definition of @xmath135 is needed such that the constraints and hence the partition function are both dimensionless ) .",
    "for example , one finds the dimensionless partition function    for free bosons , where the prime indicates the omission of the zero - eigenvalue .",

    "the difference is due to the second term on the right in ( [ t99 ] ) .",
    "let us give two arguments in favour of our result : the discrepancy arises from the prefactor appearing in the fermionic determinant ( [ t36 ] ) . as discussed earlier",
    "this prefactor implies the breakdown of holomorphic factorization , a property which has been presupposed in @xcite .",

    "it shows that the thermodynamics of the thirring model is not just that of free fermions as has been claimed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the zero point pressure is multiplied by a factor @xmath192 .",
    "this modification arises from the coupling of the current to the harmonic fields .",
    "it is missed if only the local part of the auxiliary field is considered , which is the case if one quantizes the model in minkowski space and then replaces the @xmath193-integral in the green functions by the matsubara sum .",
    "this remark should also be taken seriously in four dimensions !",
    "furthermore , we see that the pressure @xmath142 is real only for @xmath191 , which is consistent with the finite temperature boundary conditions .      in the first part of this section",

    "these structures are derive here . when comparing the classical with the quantum results one should keep in mind that the roles of @xmath200 and @xmath201 are interchanged when one switches from minkowski to euclidean space - time . in coordinates adapted to the holomorphic structure of the torus @xmath202 the dirac operator and",
    "the corresponding greens function take the form @xmath203 where @xmath204 , and the chiral components of the energy momentum tensor and current are given by @xmath205 from the conformal ward identities    we obtain the central charges and conformal weights directly from the correlation functions .",
    "however , because on the flat torus the expectation value of @xmath206 is constant , we need to compute at least the @xmath207-point function to read off the conformal weights . as in the classical theory ( see ( [ t11 ] ) ) the symmetric energy momentum tensor measures the change of the effective action @xmath208 under arbitrary variations of the metric . on the torus",
    "there are two independent contributions .",
    "one being due to variations of the modular parameter @xmath121 and its conjugate @xmath209 which depend implicitly on the metric .",
    "the other is due to the variations of terms which depend explicitly on the metric .",
    "since the chiral component @xmath206 is gotten by contracting @xmath210 with @xmath211 it follows that @xmath212 when doing metric variations it is always understood that we take the flat space - time limit afterwards .",

    "the variation of @xmath220 can be found in appendix a. this yields    thus we have reproduced the classical results supplemented by additional @xmath221 and @xmath222 dependent quantum corrections . in the thirring model limit @xmath223 , these terms add up to give the known anomalous dimension appearing in the thirring model @xcite . furthermore , from ( [ t507 ] ) we may derive a condition on the couplings @xmath224 if we insist on unitarity , i.e. on @xmath225 .",

    "one may ask what happens if we introduce a local twist instead , that is    which should be interpreted as a modification of the charge neutrality condition .",
    "the computation of the fermionic determinant in the presence of such twists is similar to that for a weyl rescaling of the background metric ( [ t539a]-[t543 ] ) . integrating the corresponding anomaly equation",
    "we find    we will come back to the relation between the above determinant and charges at infinity at the end of this section . for the moment we use the analogy merely as a motivation to study the extension of the thirring model obtained by coupling the @xmath22-field non - minimally to the background geometry .",
    "that is we consider the model ( [ t1 ] ) again without gauge - interaction but with an extra coupling @xmath246 then @xmath247 in ( [ t14 ] ) is modified , @xmath248 the corresponding modification of the classical conformal transformations ( [ help1 ] ) generated by the modified generator @xmath249 are    whereas @xmath23 and @xmath250 remain primary fields , @xmath22 does not .",
    "this is in fact needed for consistency . indeed , since @xmath18 is not a scalar under conformal transformations generated by @xmath251 , the term @xmath252 in the action is only conformally invariant if @xmath22 transforms inhomogeneously like a spin connection .",
    "it may be surprising that the new symmetry transformations depend on the coupling constant @xmath253 which is not present in the flat space time lagrangian .",

    "one finds that the quantum corrections to ( [ help2 ] ) are identical to those of the minimally coupled model and thus are @xmath255-independent.to summarize , we have obtained the following virasoro @xmath256 kac - moody structure : central charge :    kac - moody level and charges : @xmath257 conformal weights :    here some comment about unitarity is in order .",
    "it can be shown that with respect to the standard scalar product @xcite reflection - positivity holds for any real @xmath253 @xcite .",

    "we give a more detailed discussion about unitary subspaces in section @xmath259 .",
    "when quantizing a conformal field theory on a space - time with finite volume one introduces a length scale .",
    "the presence of this length scale in turn breaks the conformal invariance and gives rise to finite size effects .",

    "for example , when one stretches space time , @xmath260 , then the change of the effective action is proportional to @xmath114 :    where @xmath261 is the euler number of the euclidean space time . in @xcite",
    "this conjecture has been proven for a wide class of conformal field theories on spaces with boundaries .",
    "the only important assumption has been that the regularization respects general covariance . in this subsection",
    "we shall see that the equivalence does hold only for a particular zero - mode treatment , which differs from ( [ 52 ] ) .",
    "the only global conformal transformations on the torus are translations which do not give rise to finite size effects .",
    "also , the euler number vanishes and according to ( [ t111 ] ) the finite size effects are insensitive to the value of @xmath114 . for that reason we quantize the un - gauged model ( [ t1 ] ) on the sphere where the global conformal group is the moebius group .    an effective method to compute finite size effects has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the following observation : any conformal transformation @xmath262 is a composition of a diffeomorphism ( defined by the same @xmath263 ) and a compensating weyl transformation @xmath264 with @xmath265 therefore , choosing a diffeomorphism invariant regularization one has @xmath266 the change of the effective action under weyl rescaling is @xmath267)\\ov \\int{\\cal d}(\\lam\\phi)\\det ( i{\\di}_{\\hat g})\\exp ( -s_b[\\hat g])}\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the bosonic action ( [ t48 ] ) . since on the sphere",
    "there are no harmonic vector fields the term @xmath268 in @xmath133 is not present . imposing the conditions ( [ 52 ] )",
    "we obtain    to evaluate ( [ t112 ] ) one introduces the @xmath254-parametric family of laplacians @xmath269 interpolating between @xmath270 and @xmath141 . integrating the corresponding anomaly equation @xcite we end up with    consider now a dilatation @xmath271 .",
    "then , the conformal angle is constant , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 .",
    "then the first term in ( [ t114 ] ) vanishes and the finite size effect does not depend on @xmath274 .",
    "it is given by @xmath275 and does not agree with ( [ t111 ] ) since @xmath114 in ( [ help3 ] ) depends on @xmath253 . on other riemannian surfaces one would find the same result .",
    "note that the finite size scaling comes from the middle term @xmath276 in ( [ t114 ] ) which is topological in nature , while the short - distance behaviour of the energy - momentum correlators is controlled by the remaining two terms in ( [ t114 ] ) which are insensitive to the topology . in that sense finite size scaling and the central charge",
    "are complementary .",
    "there is a way to match the two results by adding the term @xmath277 to the effective action . with this new effective action",
    "the short distance expansion of the energy - momentum correlators does not depend on @xmath253 any more and the corresponding central charge equals that obtained from the finite size scaling .",
    "however such a term would correspond to a non - local counter term to be added to the regularized action .      in this subsection",
    "we show how the equivalence between the central charge and finite size scaling can be restored , provided the partition function is replaced by an average over un - normalized expectation values of charges at infinity .",
    "in fact it turns out that the @xmath278-term , ie .",
    "the non - minimal coupling to gravity , itself can be given the interpretation of a charge at infinity if the zero - mode constraints ( [ 52 ] ) is replaced by a non - translation invariant sum over charges at infinity .",
    "the hint comes from inspecting the fermionic weights ( [ t107 ] ) , which shows that @xmath279 and @xmath280 have the same conformal weights .",
    "we can therefore consistently put a charge at infinity with a corresponding modification of the charge neutrality condition .",
    "the non - vanishing two - point function is now @xmath281 .",
    "it s coincidence limit @xmath282 is again a primary field with conformal weight @xmath283.on the other hand , including a charge at infinity into the definition of the partition function we have    to continue we need to determine the coincidence limit of the scalar greens function @xmath284 , i.e. to regularize the composite operator @xmath285 appearing in ( [ t591 ] ) .",
    "the normal ordering prescription    works well on the whole plane @xcite . on curved space",
    "we must be more careful when renormalizing this operator .",
    "the required wave function renormalization is not unique but it is very much restricted by the following requirements : first we take as reference system ( the denominator in ( [ t76 ] ) ) one with a minimal number of dynamical degrees of freedom since we do not want to loose information by our regularization .",
    "second , the renormalized operator should have a well - defined infinite volume limit .",
    "finally , the regularization should respect general covariance .",

    "generally we can define the functional integral as an average over all possible charges at infinity : assume @xmath253 imaginary .",

    "the middle term in the above integrand is the zero - mode part of @xmath133 .",
    "the zero - mode integration yields a delta function @xmath300 and thus the @xmath278-term itself acquires the interpretation of a charge at infinity , due to the presence of the zero mode .",
    "the extra charges @xmath301 assure the charge neutrality of the partition function . for the general n - point function ( [ t555 ] )",
    "the @xmath297- integration yields @xmath302 where the sum of the @xmath19-charges of the operators in ( [ t555 ] ) enters .",
    "in particular , for neutral states , for which ( @xmath303 ) , @xmath233 must be zero and no extra charge at infinity is present.finally , using @xmath304 the averaging over all possible charges can also be written as    it is easy to verify that if the action has translation invariance in the target space , then the constraints ( [ t666 ] ) and ( [ 52 ] ) are equivalent and the correlation functions do not depend on the chosen base - point @xmath305 . however , in the present case ( [ t666 ] ) clearly breaks translation invariance ( or rotation invariance on @xmath295 ) and the zero - modes constraints are inequivalent .",
    "although we have assumed an imaginary @xmath253 , our results apply for any @xmath253 .",
    "for particular values we recover the ( unitary ) minimal models , provided screening charges @xcite are included for the @xmath306-point function with @xmath307 .",
    "in particular for @xmath308 and @xmath309 we obtain the ising model with @xmath310 .",
    "in this section we extend the model by gauging the global @xmath19-symmetry .",
    "contrary to what one might think , many aspects of the gauged model are actually simpler as compared to the ungauged model .",
    "in particular the thermodynamical properties are independent of external conditions like chemical potentials and twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the reason is that the model is closely related to the schwinger model , for which the spectrum consist solely of a neutral , massive particle . on the other hand ,",
    "the gauge interaction complicates the analysis , because the @xmath19- bundle over the torus allows for gauge field configurations with winding number , so called instantons .",
    "these , in turn , imply fermionic zero - modes which trigger a chiral symmetry breaking and therefore a non - vanishing condensate .",
    "this is the subject of the second part of this section . in the first part",
    "we discuss the partition function to which only topologically trivial configurations contribute .    to see how the fermionic generating functional ( [ t46 ] ) is modified , we decompose a general gauge potential on a torus as",
    "where the last @xmath207 terms correspond ( as for the auxiliary field @xmath25 ) to the hodge decomposition of the single valued part of @xmath35 in a given topological sector , that is the harmonic- , exact- and co - exact pieces .",
    "the role of the toron fields @xmath311 has recently been emphasized within the canonical approach @xcite . in the hamiltonian formulation",
    "they are quantum mechanical degrees of freedom which are needed for an understanding of the infrared sector in gauge theories .",
    "also , in @xcite it has been argued that the @xmath312-phases of hot pure yang - mills theories @xcite should correspond to the same physical state if the toron fields are taken into account .",
    "the first term in ( [ t520 ] ) is an _ instanton potential _ which gives rise to a non - vanishing quantized flux .",
    "as noted above configurations with non - vanishing flux do not contribute to the partition function due to the associated fermionic zero modes .",
    "we can therefore assume @xmath313 for the moment .",
    "the fermionic generating functional is obtained from ( [ t36 ] ) by simply shifting @xmath314 which leads to    with @xmath315 .    to compute the _ partition function _",
    "we must switch off the sources @xmath316 and @xmath317 in ( [ t636 ] ) so that    where now    note that we have kept the non - minimal coupling of the @xmath22-field to gravity as in section @xmath6 . since @xmath133 and the fermionic determinants are both gauge invariant and thus independent of the pure gauge mode @xmath318 in ( [ t520 ] ) , it is natural to change variables from @xmath17 to @xmath319 .",
    "this transformation is one to one , provided    in contrast to the auxiliary harmonic fields @xmath70 in ( [ help ] ) , the toron fields @xmath320 and @xmath321 with integer @xmath322 are to be identified , due to gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the measures are related as    in expectation values of gauge invariant and thus @xmath318-independent operators the @xmath318-integration cancels against the normalization .",
    "this simply expresses the fact that in @xmath323 the ghosts decouple in the lorentz gauge.as we shall see shortly it is advantageous to integrate first over the toron fields . by using the series representation of the theta functions one computes",
    "since the result appears always together with the @xmath316-function factor in ( [ t46 ] ) it is convenient to introduce @xmath324 in the following expressions .",
    "the result ( [ t55 ] ) does not depend on the @xmath179-field and hence the @xmath179-integration in ( [ t54 ] ) becomes gaussian and yields a factor @xmath325 so that    where we inserted the explicit expression ( [ t50 ] ) for the jacobian .",
    "now we see why we did well integrating over the toron fields first .",
    "it has washed out the dependence on the boundary conditions and chemical potential in ( [ t55 ] ) .",
    "the integral over @xmath22 , subject to the condition in ( [ 52 ] ) , decouples completely apart from the non - minimal coupling to gravity which modifies the liouville factor and yields one inverse square - root of the determinant of @xmath138 in ( [ t56 ] ) .",
    "thus    where we have used ( [ t58 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath23_-integration _ in contrast , leads to a finite renormalization of the dynamically generated photon mass    plays the same role as the @xmath326-mass in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the determinant obtained from the @xmath327 integration factorizes as @xmath328 this factorization property is not obvious since all determinants must be regulated .",
    "but it holds for commuting operators and in the zeta - function scheme .",
    "then the partition function simplifies to @xmath329 we can go further by using the scaling formula for the determinant of @xmath141 @xcite and the known result for the determinant of @xmath270 @xcite which together yield    thus we obtain the following partition function for the general model ( [ t1 ] ) on curved spaces :    again we have factored out the partition function @xmath330 for free auxiliary fields .",
    "the formula ( [ t63 ] ) shows explicitly that in the topologically trivial sector the theory is equivalent to a theory of free massless and massive bosons with mass @xmath241 , even in curved space - time @xcite.the appearance of @xmath241 in ( [ t60 ] ) should be interpreted as _ renormalization of the electric charge _ induced by the interaction of the auxiliary fields with the fermions . after summing over all fermion - loops",
    "this leads to an effective coupling between the photons and the @xmath23-field and in turn to a modified effective mass for the photons in ( [ t60 ] ) . in the limit @xmath331 this mass tends to the well - known schwinger model result , @xmath332 @xcite .",
    "we have already mentioned that the chemical potential coupled to the electric charge has completely disappeared from the partition function .",
    "this does not come as a surprise since the only particle in the gauged thirring model is a neutral boson .",
    "this has no charge which may couple to the chemical potential .",
    "also , if the partition function depended on @xmath46 then the expectation value of the charge would not vanish , in contradiction to the integrated gauss law .",
    "the result ( [ t63 ] ) provides therefore another test for our result ( [ t36 ] ) for the fermionic determinants with chemical potential .",
    "the final result is also independent of the chiral and non - chiral twists .",
    "the normal twists have been wiped out by the toron integration .",
    "in fact the chiral twists are equivalent to a chemical potential and therefore the above remarks concerning the chemical potential apply here as well .",
    "did we assume holomorphic factorization for the fermionic determinant @xcite then the partition function would depend on the chiral twists.we conclude this subsection by giving the explicit formula for the partition function on the flat torus",

    "in which case the partition function has the usual thermodynamical interpretation , the result reduces to one derived previously by ambjorn and wolfram @xcite .",
    "in addition , if @xmath48 approaches infinity we recover a result in @xcite .",
    "the free energy for @xmath337 and on flat space simplifies then to @xmath338 with @xmath111 from ( [ t64 ] ) and the particular choice for the parameters .",

    "in particular we found the dependence of the partition function on the chemical potential and the non - trivial boundary conditions for the fermions on the torus .",
    "for that a careful analysis of fermionic determinants has been crucial .",
    "we have found that the familiar chiral anomaly of the uv - regularized two point function is also seen in the ir - sector as a breakdown of holomorphic factorization .",
    "this fact , which has not been properly taken into account previously , together with the presence of harmonic contributions to the current , leads to a modification of the equation of state due to the current - current interaction .",
    "we believe that our results could also be obtained in the bosonized theory , provided the usual bosonization rules are modified to include scalar fields with winding numbers , i.e. scalar fields with values in a compactified target space.furthermore , we have deformed the conformal structure by allowing for different couplings in the transversal- and the longitudinal parts of the current - current interaction . this does not change the virasoro- and kac - moody algebra , but modifies the conformal weights of the primaries and in particular of the fermionic fields .",
    "not all values of the coupling constants belong to physical theories , since positivity of the scalar product imposes certain restrictions on them .",
    "our approach allows also for a non - minimal coupling of the longitudinal sector to gravity .",
    "while such a coupling may seem to be ad - hoc we gave some arguments that it might arise naturally when quantizing fermions in presence of a a background charge .",
    "we find that the central charge of the virasoro algebra is sensitive to the non - minimal coupling .",
    "in particular @xmath444 occurs for certain values of the coupling constant .",
    "however , we have not been able to derive constraints on this extra coupling without referring to the result by friedan , qiu and shenker .",
    "we believe that an independent derivation of their result within a fermionic model would be most welcome .",
    "we have also established that the central charge controls the finite size effects only for a particular treatment of the zero - modes of the auxiliary fields which is equivalent to an average over charges at infinity.finally we have considered the _ gauged thirring model _ in curved space - time .",
    "we find that the partition function is independent of vectorial as well as chiral twists and the chemical potential .",
    "this result , which technically is due to the harmonic contributions to the gauge - fields , is in fact expected as a consequence of gauss s law .",
    "furthermore , using the ( probably not so obvious ) factorization property of the zeta - function regularized determinants of commuting operators we find that the partition function can be expressed completely in terms of a single massive scalar field .",
    "the gauged thirring model shows a chiral symmetry breaking which originates in the existence of fermionic zero - modes and thus in configurations with winding number ( instantons ) .",
    "we have obtained explicit expressions for these instantons as well as the expectation value of the chiral condensate as a function of temperature and curvature .",
    "the condensate is exponentially suppressed for high temperatures and/or big curvature which is interpreted as an almost restoration of the chiral symmetry under these extreme conditions . although temperature and curvature have qualitatively the same effect they can not be identified . in particular the identification with the hawking temperature for free scalar fields in de sitter space does not hold in the present situation .",
    "it follows from general arguments that the chiral symmetry can not be restored for any finite temperature or curvature so an exponential suppression is most we can expect .",
    "in fact , it has been argued earlier , that the axial @xmath19-symmetry in @xmath9 dimensional @xmath10 also shows an almost restoration as a function of the temperature @xcite .",
    "our results on the curvature dependence could motivate a corresponding investigation in @xmath10 .",
