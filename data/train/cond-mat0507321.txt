    "piezoelectric material produces electrical charges when subjected to pressure , and stretches or contracts when an electrical field is applied , @xcite which has been widely used as acoustic transducers in telephones , musical instruments , and so on .",

    ", some researchers propose that the surfaces are not reconstructed , in stead about one - fourth charges transfer between them .",
    "@xcite however , theoretical calculation and experiments reveal that the reconstruction is preferable to charge transfer @xcite in reducing the surface energy .    after the discovery of zno nanobelts , @xcite kong and wang synthesized novel zno nanobelts , especially , nanorings and nanohelixes whose surfaces were dominated by polarized zn-(0001 ) and o-(0001 ) facets .",
    "@xcite they attributed the observed phenomena as a result of surface polar charges and explained that the formation of these nanostructures as a consequence of minimizing the total energy contributed by spontaneous polarization and elasticity .",
    "@xcite this model requires the ratio of the thickness @xmath3 to the radius @xmath4 of the nanorings to be smaller than a constant , and later more experimental data located in the green domain of fig.5a in ref .   supported this model .",
    "however , the optimal relation between the thickness and the radius of nanorings ( black line of fig.5a in ref .  ) in their concise model can not fit well the experimental data . to improve this relation , an elaborate theory considering more factors than their model but remaining its main spirit",
    "is needed .    additionally ,",
    "because of the symmetry of wurtzite structure , we know that there are 5 independent elastic constants for bulk zno that have been measured as @xmath5 gpa , @xmath6 gpa , @xmath7 gpa , @xmath8 gpa , @xmath9 gpa .",
    "@xcite from these experimental values , we see @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "that is , bulk zno can be roughly regarded as an isotropic material , and thus its young s modulus can be calculated as @xmath13 gpa from these experimental data .",
    "it is very surprising that young s modulus of zno nanobelt is measured experimentally only @xmath14 gpa , @xcite which is much smaller than that of bulk zno .",
    "one needs to understand what makes this large difference of young s modulus between bulk zno and the nanobelt .    in the present paper",
    "we try to address these issues .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - shape ] , we construct the shape formation energy of zno nanobelts that consists of elastic energy , spontaneous polarization - induced surface energy , volume energy , and defect - induced energy .",
    "and then we put forward necessary conditions of structure existence . in sec .",
    "[ sec - expl ] , we use necessary conditions of structure existence to explain nanorings and nanohelixes observed in experiments .",
    "we find that they are stable and energetically favorable structures . in sec .",
    "[ sec - sum ] , we give a brief summary and discussion .",
    "some detailed derivations are supplied in appendix .",
    "in order to quantitatively understand morphological problems of nanostructures in theoretical point view , such as helixes of multi - walled carbon nanotubes @xcite and cholesterol filaments , @xcite ou - yang and his co - authors proposed a concept that the shape formation energy determines the morphology of structures . their concept can be summarized and generalized as follows : a structure can exist if its shape formation energy is minimum and less than zero , provided that the thermal fluctuation can be neglected . we will define and construct the shape formation energy of zno nanobelts in this section , and then express explicitly the necessary conditions of structure existence .",
    "the synthesis process of zno nanobelts is briefly described as follows .",
    "@xcite when zno powders are heated to 1350 @xmath15c at a heating rate of 20 @xmath15c / min , they decompose into zn@xmath0 and o@xmath1 at low pressure @xmath16 torr . after a few minutes of evaporation and decomposition ,",
    "the ar carrier gas is introduced at a flux of 25 standard cubic centimeters per minute .",
    "the condensation products are carried to a temperature zone of 400@xmath17500 @xmath15c and deposit onto an alumina substrate under the ar pressure of 250 torr , where the end products  nanobelts are formed .",
    "this process can be simplified as a chemical  reaction \" : @xmath18    schematic energy landscape of the synthesis process of zno nanobelts is shown in fig .",
    "[ elandscape ] , where condensation products are regarded as a meso - phase .",
    "the shape formation energy @xmath19 is defined as the energy difference between zno nanobelt and condensation products with the same number of atoms .",
    "a zno nanobelt is a thin but long structure as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ frame ] .",
    "the symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent zn - terminated and o - terminated surfaces , respectively .",
    "the curve @xmath22 is its central line ; @xmath23 is the tangent vector of curve @xmath22 perpendicular to the cross section of the nanobelt ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( parallel to [ 0001 ] direction of zno ) are principal axes of the cross section .",
    "@xmath26 is the normal vector of @xmath22 that determines the bending direction of @xmath22 in 3-dimensional space , and @xmath27 the angle between @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath28 is the binormal vector of curve @xmath22 . @xmath29 and @xmath3 , the width and thickness of the nanobelt because of @xmath30 in experiments , @xcite",
    "represent the dimensions in @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions , respectively . because @xmath29 and @xmath3 are much smaller than the length of the nanobelt , the geometry of the nanobelt is determined uniquely by its central line @xmath22 and the angle @xmath27 . since the bending with @xmath31 is preferred to others because of @xmath32 , we concentrate on this case in this paper .",
    "the final form of the shape formation energy of the nanobelt should depend merely on geometric quantities of @xmath22 , such as the curvature @xmath33 and the torsion @xmath34 .",
    "we propose that it consists of elastic energy , surface energy , volume energy , and defect - induced energy as discussed below .",
    "the elastic energy per unit arc length can be written in an invariant quadratic form including infinitesimal displacements of the frame @xmath35 : @xmath36,\\label{elaseng}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the arc length element .",

    "@xmath50 , @xmath51 is in the range between 4/3 and 2 .    consider the geometric relations @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the frenet formula @xcite @xmath54 eq.([elaseng ] ) is simplified as @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 . especially , for @xmath31 , the elastic energy per unit arc length can be written as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 .    because the nanobelt has two large polar surfaces , we must take into account their surface energy .",
    "the surface energy per unit arc length is phenomenologically expressed as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a constant quantity with the dimension of energy per unit area .",
    "the volume energy comes from two sources : one is the gibbs free energy difference between the solid phase and the meso - phase ( condensation products ) ; another is the electric energy induced by the spontaneous polarization . the volume energy per unit arc length is phenomenologically expressed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant quantity with the dimension of energy per unit volume .      as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec - intro ] , the value of experimental young s modulus of nanobelts ( @xmath1750 gpa ) is less than half of bulk zno s value ( @xmath17 120 gpa ) . in order to compare the elastic constants of perfect zno thin films with bulk zno , we adopt a slab model and density functional theory ( dft ) method to calculate them .",
    "@xcite to reduce the computational task , we take the frozen - ion approximation and concentrate on the elastic constant @xmath63 .",
    "the computed ratio @xmath64/@xmath65 as a function of the slab thickness is shown in fig .",
    "[ c11fig ] .",
    "it is clear that the values of @xmath64/@xmath65 are close to 1 , which implies that the mechanical properties of perfect zno nanobelts have little difference from bulk zno .",
    "thus the nanobelts observed in experiments must contain defects that reduce young s modulus of nanobelts significantly .",
    "there are several clues for the existence of defects in real nanobelts .",
    "a direct one is high resolution images of nanobelts .",
    "for example , the nanoring shown in fig.4d of ref .",
    "is not an perfect , uniform structure .",
    "high - resolution transmission electron microscopy also reveals that planar defects exist in the nanobelts .",
    "@xcite    it is hard to write an exact expression of defect - induced energy .",
    "but if we only consider structures with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the defect - induced energy can be locally expanded up to the second order terms of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is expressed formally as @xmath70wt,\\label{defecte1}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constant quantities with dimension energy per unit volume . to avoid the symmetry breaking of chirality , the linear term of @xmath69 is not included in the above expression . comparing eq.([defecte1 ] ) with eqs.([elastice ] ) and ( [ volumee ] ) , we find that @xmath71 and @xmath72 play a similar role with the young s modulus while @xmath73 influences the value of volume energy density @xmath62 . the rest term can induce a local spontaneous curvature of nanobelts randomly .",
    "recently , the idea that defects induce a local spontaneous curvature has also been proposed to explain the cyclization phenomenon of short dna . @xcite      the final form of the shape formation energy is thus written as @xmath75w ds,\\label{shapeng}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the effective young s modulus and the volume energy density of zno nanobelts , respectively .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath76 can be taken as the experimental value 50 gpa .",
    "now we estimate the effect of thermal fluctuation on the shapes of nanobelts . considering the typical growth temperature @xmath78 k , the young s modulus @xmath79 gpa , the typical thickness @xmath80 nm , and the width @xmath81 nm in the experiments , @xcite we estimate the persistence length of nanobelts as @xmath82 cm , @xcite which is much larger than the typical length of nanobelts of several microns .",
    "thus the effect of thermal fluctuation can be neglected and the necessary conditions of structure existence can be expressed as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 represent the first and second order variations of the shape formation energy , respectively . if a structure satisfies the above three conditions , we call it stable and energetically favorable structure .    from eq.([detaf ] ) , we arrive at the following shape equations of nanobelts : @xmath86   + \\frac{\\chi \\tau^2}{t}-\\frac{(\\eta+\\xi t)\\kappa}{2t^3}=0,\\label{shap1}\\\\ & &   2\\kappa_{s}\\tau+\\kappa\\tau_{s }   + \\beta\\left [ \\tau_{s}\\tau^{2}-\\left ( \\tau\\kappa\\right )   _ { s}-\\left ( \\frac{\\tau_s}{\\kappa}\\right ) _ { ss}\\right ]   -\\frac{\\chi \\tau_s}{t}=0,\\label{shap2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 represents the derivative respect to @xmath91 .",
    "the detailed derivations of above two equations are shown in appendix .",
    "the necessary conditions of structure existence are transformed into eqs.([deta2f])([shap2 ] ) .",
    "now let us use eqs.([deta2f])([shap2 ] ) to explain nanorings and nanohelixes observed in experiments .      for nanorings with radius @xmath4 , one has @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "eq.([shap1 ] ) is transformed into @xmath94 while eq.([shap2 ] ) is trivial . by fitting this equation to the experimental data @xcite as shown in fig .",

    "any perturbation in the vicinity of a cycle with radius @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 @xmath100 are small constants .",
    "the second order variation is evaluated explicitly as @xmath101 under the validity of eq.([nanoringe ] ) .",
    "next , nanorings observed in experiments must satisfy condition ( [ fless0 ] ) .",
    "this requires @xmath102 to be valid for all experimental data .",
    "thus we can take the supremum of @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ tdr - overr ] as the value of @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath105 .      for a nanohelix with radius @xmath106 and pitch @xmath107 ,",

    "the curvature and the torsion are @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",

    "eq.([nanohelixe ] ) sets a relation between the thickness , the pitch angle and the radius of nanohelixes , from which we can estimate the thickness .",

    "@xcite    additionally , the shape formation energy can be calculated as @xmath112,\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the total length of the nanohelixes .",
    "its value is listed in table [ helixtab ] for three nanohelixes observed in the experiments using @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , we also found the matrix @xmath114 is positive definite for these nanohelixes .",
    "therefore , these nanohelixes are stable and energetically favorable structures .",
    "in the present work , we construct the shape formation energy of zno nanobelts that consists of elastic energy , spontaneous polarization - induced surface energy , volume energy , and defect - induced energy .",
    "we put forward the necessary conditions of structure existence and find that nanorings and nanohelixes of zno observed in experiments are stable and energetically favorable structures .",
    "we obtain an important result that nanorings and nanohelixes must satisfy eqs.([nanoringe ] ) and ( [ nanohelixe ] ) , respectively .",
    "we notice that it is easy to measure experimentally the values of the radius of nanorings or the pitch and radius of nanohelixes , while it is difficult to measure their thickness of about ten nanometers in high precision because the error of inlens detector is @xmath115 nm .",
    "@xcite eqs.([nanoringe ] ) and ( [ nanohelixe ] ) provide a way to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the present theory may also be developed to explain the recent synthesized superlattice - structured nanohelxes .",
    "@xcite    because of the influence of defects , young s modulus @xmath76 and volume energy density @xmath77 are quite different from the value of perfect and uniform nanobelts . for example , @xmath79 gpa is just half of the value of perfect nanobelts .",
    "@xmath77 is estimated as @xmath116 j / m@xmath117 by @xmath118 .",
    "this value departs largely from the cohesive energy @xmath119 j / m@xmath117 of zno .",
    "@xcite the surface energy density @xmath60 is estimated as @xmath120 j / m@xmath121 , which can not compare with the cleavage energy @xmath122 j / m@xmath121 for perfect zn-(0001 ) and o-(0001 ) surfaces obtained by _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "@xcite there is no theory on the parameter @xmath74 at present , which is expected to depend on the defect density and experimental conditions .",
    "we estimate its value @xmath123 j / m@xmath117 from the experiment published in ref .  .",
    "in the above discussion , we do not include flexoelectric effect @xcite of piezoelectric materials in nanoscale .",
    "this effect is too small for crystals @xcite to influence the above results in statics .",
