    "layered magnetic systems with coupled charge and spin degrees of freedom have received considerable attention recently owing to their rich phase diagram and intriguing transport properties . the layered system and its doped variant , recently studied by felser et al.@xcite and ryazanov et al.@xcite ,",
    "show significant magnetoresistance@xcite of about 60% at room temperature with a ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition temperature close to 300k@xcite .",
    "unlike the magnetoresistive manganites or their bilayer counterparts , there is no significant jahn - teller coupling in these systems and that enables one to study a purely electronic model , coupled to magnetic degrees of freedom , without the involvement of the lattice .",
    "in addition , is isostructural to the well - known dichalcogenides like 2h - tas@xmath0 , 2h - tase@xmath0 with hexagonal layered structure , but do not show any superconducting instability - in fact the resistivity rises at low temperatures .",
    "it has been pointed out recently@xcite that the large magnetoresistance in is primarily due to the freezing out of the spin disorder scattering of the conduction electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "there is indeed evidence for spin fluctuation coupled to charge degrees of freedom in the esr experiments@xcite .",
    "the broad resistivity anomaly at curie temperature ( t@xmath1 ) shifts towards higher temperatures with magnetic field . from susceptibility",
    "measurements@xcite a variety of regions with different degree of spin ordering have been proposed .",
    "the high - temperature ferromagnetic phase gives way to regions of frozen or short - range correlated spins at lower temperatures . at",
    "about 33% hole doping a sliver of spin glass phase appears at low temperatures ( @xmath2k ) changing over to a paramagnetic ( pm ) phase with doping .    in the rare earth gd ions have one electron in the @xmath3-band coupled to the localised gd @xmath4 electrons through ferromagnetic exchange in the configuration @xmath5 .",
    "the rare earth ions are arranged in a hexagonally coordinated layer structure , each gd ion has six nearest - neighbour gd ions .",
    "each such layer is separated from the next one by two layers of iodine atoms .",
    "this results in having the inter - layer coupling among the gd ions considerably weaker than the intra - layer one .",
    "lda band structure results indicate a spin splitting of the conduction band @xcite - the splitting is nearly complete in the lda+u results .",
    "the crystal field in the trigonal prismatic layered dichalcogenide is negligible and the @xmath6 orbitals are quite strongly mixed .",
    "band structure calculations ( see below ) indicate that there is one half - filled @xmath3-band that crosses the fermi level .",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction in the rare earth @xmath6 level is generally not very strong .",
    "but a single , half - filled narrow @xmath3-band crossing the fermi level and low dimensionality of the system make this repulsion quite relevant .",
    "the presence of short - range spin fluctuations and spin disordered phases already point to competing magnetic exchange interactions in the system . in the half - filled single @xmath3-band , even a small coulomb repulsion generates af fluctuations that will compete with the fm interaction mediated by the conduction band via the fm @xmath7 exchange ( similar to the zener double exchange ( de ) mechanism ) .",
    "it is also useful to note that the system never shows full saturation moment , predicted by the lda calculations .",
    "the ordered state has a moment of 7.33@xmath8 , less than the full saturation moment of 8@xmath8 out of which 7@xmath8 presumably comes from the @xmath4 core spins@xcite . hence the moment coming from the 5@xmath3 electron is considerably less than 1@xmath8 indicating that correlation effects ( beyond the density functional calculations ) and coupling of the spin and charge degrees of freedom are very relevant .",
    "also there is almost no literature on the study of a correlated de model on a non - bipartite lattice . on a triangular lattice",
    ", it is known that the nearest - neighbour ising af interactions are frustrated leading to a finite ground state entropy .",
    "indeed , the ground state of af heisenberg spin model or any correlated electronic model on a triangular lattice is not known . in the few studies that exist on frustrated itinerant systems @xcite ,",
    "the geometric frustration of the lattice has often been replaced by a random spin exchange . for a review on these and related issues ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref . .",
    "spin - polarized band structure calculations were performed for the experimental crystal structure of gdi@xmath0 @xcite within local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) using the lmto method @xcite in the atomic sphere approximation with the combined correction term taken into account .",
    "gd 4@xmath9 electrons were assumed to be completely localized and treated as quasi - core states .",

    "[ fig : fb ] ) .",
    "one can glean that the assumption@xcite of two lowest gd @xmath3 bands formed predominantly by a @xmath22 orbital is not confirmed by our calculation . except for the @xmath12 space region around the @xmath29 high symmetry direction ,",
    "the contributions of @xmath22 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 orbitals to the bands in question as well as to the two bands above the gap are comparable . thus , the gap appears as a result of a rather strong hybridization between the above orbitals in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "four highest gd @xmath3 bands are formed by @xmath31 states which are shifted towards higher energies due to the trigonal component of the ligand field .",

    "al.@xcite ( see text),title=\"fig:\",width=7 ]",
    "it is clear from the band structure calculations that the band crossing the fermi level is a mixture of primarily three d - orbitals , namely d@xmath32 , d@xmath33 and d@xmath34 .",
    "it is therefore not possible to obtain a one - parameter , tight - binding fit of this band with only nearest neighbour hopping@xcite .",
    "we fit this band using a three parameter ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 = -0.514 , 0.070 and 0.073 ev ) tight binding one ( fig .",
    "the band width is about 1ev and we assume the on - site repulsion to be close to or less than this . in any case , we treat this as a parameter in our calculation .",
    "the corresponding density of states ( dos ) is shown in fig . 3b along with the dos of the one - parameter nearest neighbour dos used by hanisch et al@xcite in their study of the hubbard model on a triangular lattice .",
    "the values of @xmath7 exchange have been estimated from the above band structure results assuming a mean - field description for the exchange and a classical description for the core spin .",
    "assuming further that the spin splitting is entirely due to @xmath7 exchange , the value @xmath38 then serves as an upper limit for the value of the exchange coupling ( @xmath39 is the @xmath4 core spin ) .",
    "based on the above arguments , a possible hamiltonian for the effective degrees of freedom can be written as    @xmath40    here @xmath41 is the exchange interaction between the localised 4f spins @xmath42 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the second term is the @xmath7 fm exchange coupling ( @xmath43 are the core and conduction spin , respectively ) while the third term represents the hopping of conduction electrons .",
    "the last term represents the hubbard interaction . in second - order perturbation theory",
    ", @xmath44 is due to the virtual exchange of conduction electrons between sites @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it turns out to be antiferromagnetic ( af ) .",
    "its magnitude is small for the parameters discussed above .",
    "away from half filling , the de mechanism favours an fm configuration of the core spins driven by the kinetic energy ( ke ) of the electrons , while the coulomb repulsion @xmath47 favours an antiferromagnetic arrangement .",
    "this leads to competing ground states tuned by filling , with additional richness coming from the intrinsic geometric frustration of an af state defined on a triangular lattice . in the following , we keep @xmath48 and study the magnetic phase diagram of the model .",
    "we treat core spins ( s=7/2 ) semi - classically and use mean - field theory for the coulomb repulsion @xmath47 .",
    "the effective 5d band at the fermi surface in the undoped system ( @xmath49 ) is half - filled i.e. , the electron density @xmath50 .",
    "hole ( electron ) doping , therefore , implies @xmath51 .",
    "doping of holes in the is effected by the insertion of hydrogen @xcite which localises electrons away from the band .",
    "this is taken care by suitably moving the fermi energy . in the limit of @xmath52 and with a nearest - neighbour tight - binding band ,",
    "this model represents the single band hubbard model on a triangular lattice studied within mean - field theory by several groups @xcite .",
    "these studies find a number of magnetically ordered phases , i.e. , the fm state , the nel state [ ferromagnetic rows coupled antiferromagnetically , the ordering wave vector @xmath53 , the afm state ( classical state , angle between spins 120@xmath54 ) and the linear spin - density wave state ( lsdw ) , containing zig - zag fm chains [ @xmath55 . for low @xmath47",
    "there is a region of no long range order ( paramagnetic phase ) even at half - filling , contrary to the square lattice where the band is particle - hole symmetric .",
    "disorder in this system plays a significant role in determining the resistivity and short - range order , particularly at low temperatures .",
    "in fact , the resistivity is too high - at 100k the minimum value is about 20@xmath56 , three orders of magnitude larger than the maximum metallic resistivity for this system ( about 10 @xmath57 , assuming a cylindrical fs and lattice constants @xmath58  along the plane )",
    ". it can not be only disorder that is responsible for this high resistivity in the metallic state , the interaction surely plays a major role . at the moment",
    "we do not take the disorder into account and look at the clean limit to investigate the possible magnetic orders that the model provides .",
    "the effects of disorder will be taken up in a separate calculation@xcite later .",
    "it is also useful to note that the @xmath4 levels are not very far from the fermi level and a small hybridisation @xmath59 between @xmath4 and @xmath6 electrons can not be ruled out completely on the basis of energetics alone from the band structure results .",
    "however , such a term should be very small owing to reasonably large @xmath60 and at most add a small af coupling between the @xmath3 and @xmath9 electrons effectively reducing @xmath61 only slightly .",

    "the physics of the model is controlled by competition between the fm double exchange and the af correlations coming from the coulomb repulsion @xmath47 .",
    "the geometric frustration of the af state on a triangular lattice adds to the number of possible ground states and their closeness in energy . in the limit @xmath63",
    ", one can project out the direction of conduction electron spins parallel to the local core spin by using the transformation @xmath64 .",
    "it operates on a two - component spinor and reduces to a system of spinless fermions ( the angles @xmath65 refer to the polar and azimuthal angle of the conduction electron spin with respect to @xmath42 ) .",
    "the on - site coulomb term , in that case , becomes irrelevant .",
    "in this situation the af superexchange term becomes important , though the de mechanism would lead to an fm state except close to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "however , the and systems are not really described by this limit and a finite @xmath61 is the relevant limit here .",
    "we treat the core spins classically and the coulomb interaction term in a mean - field approximation . to describe the different magnetic states in this approximation , we choose @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the wave vector corresponding to the chosen state described earlier .",
    "we choose the spin quantization axis in the @xmath70 plane .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian eqn.(1 ) then connects every @xmath12 point in the brillouin zone to @xmath71 and one has to diagonalise the hamiltonian on a k - grid in the hexagonal bz .",
    "the order parameter is obtained by minimising the free energy for a particular filling .",
    "for the present calculations we have chosen to investigate the following ordered phases known from previous investigations on triangular lattices .",
    "the fm phase , the nel state , the three - sublattice afm state and the lsdw state mentioned earlier .",
    "we use the three parameter tight - binding fit to the band appropriate for and systems for our calculations .",
    "as mentioned above , the coulomb interactions are generally not very strong in the @xmath6 level , though for the narrow band crossing the fermi level ( see fig.1 ) they may still be very important . since both @xmath7 exchange and @xmath72 contribute to the spin splitting of the conduction band , it is difficult to specify these two parameters .",
    "we therefore allow them to vary over a possible range , treat them as free parameters and draw the magnetic phase diagram .    in fig . 4 ( a)-(c )",
    "the phase diagrams for @xmath52 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are shown .",
    "the @xmath52 phase diagram can be compared with a similar phase diagram obtained by hanisch et al.@xcite with a nn tight - binding band dispersion @xmath75 .",
    "it is noticed that there are considerable differences between the two calculations . at half - filling ,",
    "@xmath50 , we observe the nel state for @xmath47 close to 0.4@xmath76 ( about @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the bandwidth ) .",
    "this continues all the way upto @xmath79 .",
    "the region of nel state is quite wide in our phase diagram around @xmath50 . for @xmath80",
    ", we obtain a paramagnetic phase all the way down .",
    "hanisch et al .",
    "report three - sublattice af phase at half - filling at @xmath81 ( @xmath82 for the triangular lattice , so that @xmath83 ) similar to what has been observed earlier@xcite .",
    "away from half - filling we get a small region of phase segregation ( ps ) followed by lsdw , afm , fm and finally another region of ps depending on the value of @xmath47 on the hole - doped side , while for @xmath84 there is a large region of phase separation from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the phase diagram changes dramatically with finite values of @xmath61 . as seen in fig .",
    "4(b ) the pm phase reduces to a region close to the empty ( @xmath66 ) and full ( @xmath67 ) bands . due to the asymmetry in the dos ,",
    "the regions of stability of the pm phase for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are very different , the latter being larger .",
    "the rest of the pm region becomes fm for finite @xmath7 exchange as expected .",
    "the afm region completely disappears while the nel region becomes narrow beyond @xmath79 .",
    "the lsdw phase also shrinks considerably . with increasing @xmath61",
    "the fm region takes over completely ( fig .",
    "two narrow pm regions survive at the ends owing to negligible ke contributions .",
    "it is obvious from the phase diagrams shown that the value of @xmath61 for systems should be very small but finite . in the model without disorder , the phases are extremely sensitive to changes in the @xmath7 exchange .",
    "this is suggestive of the fact that indeed in several phases appear very close by in energy . just as in other similar correlated systems with competing interactions , e.g. , the manganites@xcite and the double perovskites@xcite",
    ", a fine tuning of the model parameters is necessary to specify the phases of the system .",
    "such a situation leads to multiple phases with possible microscopic phase segregation as we observe in fig .",
    "the appearance of a multitude of phase segregated regions in the present case also has to do with the underlying frustration of the af states on a triangular lattice .",
    "the large entropy present in the ground state or very close to it make the ground states easily tunable .    in view of such sensitivity of the phases to @xmath61",
    ", we draw the phase diagram also in @xmath85 plane for a fixed value of @xmath86 . fig .",
    "5 reveals that in order to obtain multiple phases , @xmath61 should be less than about 17.5@xmath87 .",
    "there are the phases lsdw , nel , fm and pm present in the phase diagram with a region of phase separation coming from the first order transition between the nel and fm phases . for bigger values of @xmath61",
    "the entire phase diagram is ferromagnetic .",
    "such a low value for @xmath7 exchange indicates that the spin splitting in the @xmath88band is not due entirely to the @xmath7 exchange . instead",
    "a considerable part must come from correlations in the conduction band .",
    "plane for @xmath89,width=7 ]    the phase diagram presented in ryazanov et al.,@xcite does not seem to show regions of phase segregation or af spin order .",
    "on the other hand they do indicate the presence of a spin glass region ( or a mixture of fm and sg ) beyond @xmath90 as can be inferred from the broad susceptibility peak they observe .",
    "doping beyond @xmath91 suppresses long range magnetic order completely and leads to a broad paramagnetic region .",
    "the region @xmath92 showed large thermal hysteresis in the susceptibility data .",
    "there is a splitting between the field - cooled and zero field - cooled susceptibility at low temperature indicating disordered magnetic behaviour ( arising from domain rotations , magnetic clusters or superparamagnetic regions ) .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature is also very sensitive to the method of sample preparation and the measurement techniques .",
    "as reported by the authors@xcite , the data are quite noisy and the system appears to be intrinsically disordered , no matter how carefully prepared .",
    "the high value of resistivity in the metallic phase and the unsaturated magnetic moment deep inside the fm phase are suggestive of the presence of disorder as well as correlation .",
    "all this indicate a possible competition between different ground states , high degree of magnetic disorder and a possible microscopic phase segregations . as in the observed phase diagram",
    ", there is a predominance of the fm region close to half - filling that we also find , but there are other phases close by depending on the value of @xmath7 exchange coupling in the calculated phase diagram .",
    "the actual value of hole doping in for a given value of @xmath93 , is difficult to ascertain@xcite , though increasing @xmath93 is understood to have the effect of hole doping .",
    "it is expected from our calculations that there would be several different phases and microscopic phase segregations in this system too .",
    "the large magnetoresistance in has already been attributed @xcite to the quenching of spin disorder scattering of the conduction electrons . in a microscopically phase segregated system ,",
    "there is likely to be very large magnetic scattering across microscale ordered regions . in an aligning field such scattering is reduced drastically leading to a drop in resistivity . in the model , we had a superexchange interaction to begin with which we have neglected in the calculations that followed .",
    "the presence of such a term would increase af tendencies and thereby allow for a larger value of @xmath61 than we derived above . besides , the end regions of the phase diagram , @xmath94 will also become antiferromagnetic owing to the absence of itinerant electrons there .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied a model which , we believe , describes some of the features of the nearly two dimensional , triangular lattice magnetic system .",
    "the resulting phase diagram has some broad similarity with the experimental one , though it predicts much more structure in the ground state phases than has so far been observed .",
    "we hope to motivate more experiments in these directions in order to check on our predictions .",
    "we are indebted to r. k. kremer and m. ryazanov for communicating to us some of their results prior to publication and for clarifying some of the experimental points involved ."
