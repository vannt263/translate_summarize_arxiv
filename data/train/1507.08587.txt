    "nonclassical light plays a central role in quantum optics  @xcite and atom optics  @xcite leading to various applications in quantum technologies , including quantum cryptography and communication , and optical quantum information processing  @xcite .    in a sense ,",
    "all states of light are quantum , so which of them can be considered classical ? it is usually assumed that coherent states are classical .",
    "thus , also their mixtures ( e.g. , thermal states ) are classical .",
    "all other states of light are considered nonclassical ( or quantum ) .",
    "formally , this criterion can be given in terms of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath1  function  @xcite : a given state @xmath2 is nonclassical if and only if it is not described by a positive ( semidefinite ) function @xmath3 .",
    "thus , all finite superpositions ( except for the vacuum ) of arbitrary fock states are nonclassical .",
    "we note that this definition `` hides some serious problems '' , as discussed in , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "various methods and criteria have been devised to test whether a given state of light is nonclassical ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    ". however , with respect to the above definition , it seems much more interesting physically to quantify the nonclassicality of light rather than only to test ( detect ) it .",
    "for the last thirty years various measures of nonclassicality have been studied ( for reviews see refs .",
    "the most popular of them include entanglement potentials , nonclassical distance  @xcite , and nonclassical depth  @xcite . for a comparative studies of these measures",
    "see recent refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "other measures or parameters of nonclassicality were described in , e.g. , the recent refs .",
    "many studies have been devoted to the nonclassical volume  @xcite , which is the volume of the negative part of the wigner function of a given state .",
    "but it should be stressed that this nonclassical volume is not a good measure but only a parameter of nonclassicality , as it vanishes for some nonclassical states , including ideal squeezed states .    in this paper",
    "we solely analyze universal nonclassicality measures defined via entanglement potentials , which are closely related to standard entanglement measures . specifically , as introduced by asboth  @xcite",
    ", one can quantify the nonclassicality of a given single - mode state by measuring the entanglement generated from this state and the vacuum by an auxiliary balanced beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "this approach is operationally much simpler than other nonclassicality measures , including the mentioned nonclassical depth and distance .    to be more specific ,",
    "the nonclassicality of a single - mode state @xmath2 can be quantified , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , by the entanglement of the output state @xmath4 of an auxiliary lossless balanced bs with the state @xmath2 and the vacuum @xmath5 at the inputs , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , is the unitary transformation for a balanced bs , which can be given in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the input modes .",
    "this transformation @xmath13 is equivalent to that applied in ref .",
    "@xcite up to a local unitary transformation , which does not change the entanglement of @xmath4 , as quantified by any `` good '' entanglement measure .",
    "note that linear transformations ( like that performed by a bs ) do not change the nonclassicality of a given state",
    ". the output state @xmath4 is entangled if and only if the input state @xmath2 is nonclassical . in particular , for the input in an arbitrary finite - dimensional state , except for the vacuum state , the output state is entangled .",
    "it should be stressed that the standard entanglement potentials , as proposed ( and numerically verified ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , are based solely on the special case of @xmath4 for @xmath9 , i.e. , when the bs transmissivity is equal to 1/2 corresponding to a balanced ( 50/50 ) bs .    in this paper",
    ", we compare three standard entanglement potentials of a single - qubit input state @xmath2 corresponding to the entanglement measures of the two - qubit output state @xmath14 .",
    "the analyzed qubit is assumed to be in an arbitrary ( coherent or incoherent ) superposition of the vacuum and single - photon fock states , so it can be referred to as a photon - number qubit .",
    "we quantify the nonclassicality of @xmath2 by the negativity potential ( np ) , concurrence potential ( cp ) , and the potential for the relative entropy of entanglement ( reep ) : @xmath15 which are defined via the negativity @xmath16 , concurrence @xmath17 , and ree @xmath18 for @xmath4 .",
    "although these entanglement measures are well - known , for clarity , we give their definitions and operational interpretations in appendix  a. the reep is also referred to as the entropic entanglement potential in the original ref .",
    "we emphasize again that we refer to _ entanglement potential _ of a given state @xmath2 for _ any _ entanglement measure applied to the output @xmath14 .",
    "various entanglement potentials , which are based on this unified approach of measuring nonclassicality and entanglement , have been attracting increasing interest especially during the past year ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the ultimate goal of such studies is to demonstrate how nonclassicality can operationally be used as a resource for quantum technologies and quantum information processing .",
    "thus , one of the most natural and fundamental questions in this area addresses the relationship between entanglement and other types of nonclassicality .",
    "for example , the problem of faithfully converting single - system nonclassicality into entanglement in general mathematical terms was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the following conclusions : `` these results generalize and link convertibility properties from the resource theory of coherence , spin coherent states , and optical coherent states , while also revealing important connections between local and non - local quantum correlations . ''",
    "a conservation relation of nonclassicality and entanglement in a balanced beam splitter was found for some limited classes of gaussian states in ref .",

    "was described for gaussian states in ref .",

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the cp of a single qubit state @xmath2 can be interpreted as a hillery - type nonclassical distance , defined by the bures distance of @xmath2 to the vacuum , which is the closest classical state in the single - qubit hilbert space .",

    "@xcite by comparing the np and cp .    here",
    "we present a comparative study of these three entanglement potentials , to show that such quantified relative nonclassicality , i.e. , the nonclassicality of one measure relative to another , can be increased by damping and unbalanced beam splitting .",

    "@xcite we showed that both pure and completely - dephased single - qubit states can be considered the most nonclassical by comparing some nonclassicality measures . here",

    "equation  ( [ ncerhob2 ] ) clearly shows that the pdc can be used for one or both output modes .",
    "we can summarize that it is possible to increase the nonclassicality of an input state by the phase damping of the bs output state .",
    "specifically , one can increase the negativity for a given value of the ree @xmath118 in comparison to that predicted by the standard entanglement potentials using a balanced bs without damping .",
    "this increased nonclassicality is shown by the upper red crescent - shape region in fig .  2 , where the uppermost curve corresponds to the entanglement of the bell - diagonal states @xmath70 .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the entanglement and nonclassicality measures are not increased by the phase damping channels ( since they act locally on the output ) , but the possible ratios of different measures can be increased .",
    "specifically , we start from a highly nonclassical state and decrease its entanglement ( and nonclassicality ) via this phase damping in a such way that the final state has the entanglement , corresponding to the upper red region in fig .  2 , which can not be generated from a single - qubit state using a bs without damping .",
    "now we show that the nonclassicality quantified by the ree for a given value of the negativity , @xmath136 can be increased by amplitude damping . here",
    "we assume that the bs is balanced ( not tunable ) , but we place an amplitude - damping channel in both ( or even single ) output modes ( ports ) .",
    "an amplitude - damping channel ( adc ) for the @xmath119th qubit can be described by the following kraus operators  @xcite : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the amplitude - damping coefficient , and @xmath122 . as can easily be verified ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a pure state @xmath139 , given in eq .  ( [ psi_q ] ) , is changed by the adc into the mixed state @xmath140 which is the generalized horodecki state , given in eq .",
    "( [ rhogh ] ) for @xmath141 and @xmath142 $ ] .",

    "( [ rhoa ] ) .",
    "thus , we have shown that the nonclassicality of an input state can be increased by the amplitude damping of the bs output state in such a way that the ree for a given value of the negativity , @xmath148 , is increased in comparison to the maximum nonclassicality predicted by the standard entanglement potentials .",
    "this extra nonclassicality corresponds to the lower red crescent - shape region in fig .  2 , where the lower boundary corresponds to the optimal generalized horodecki states @xmath75 .",
    "analogously to the explanation in sec .",
    "v.a , it is important to clarify that the amplitude damping applied locally can not increase `` good '' entanglement measures , but it can increase the ratios of different measures .",
    "thus , by having a highly nonclassical state , one can decrease its entanglement via amplitude damping in a such manner that the final damped state has the entanglement corresponding to some point in the lower red region in fig .  2 , which can not be generated in the standard approach , i.e. , from a single - qubit state via a balanced lossless bs .",
    "the effect of amplitude damping can be simply modelled by a tunable lossless bs , as described by @xmath13 , given below eq .",
    "( [ rhoout1 ] ) but for @xmath149 .",
    "then , by assuming that the single - qubit @xmath2 is given by eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , the two - qubit output state is simply described by @xmath150 , \\label{rhooutt}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is the bs transmissivity and @xmath152 is the bs reflectivity .",
    "then , one can observe that @xmath153 for @xmath76 reduces to the generalized horodecki state @xmath154 , given in eq .",
    "( [ rhogh ] ) , i.e. , @xmath155 in analogy to the results of sec .",

    "( [ rhoa ] ) , as a special case of @xmath154 .",

    "thus , such high nonclassicality of @xmath2 can not be measured by applying the standard entanglement potentials .",
    "these results are summarized in table  i.",
    "this paper addressed the problem of quantifying the nonclassicality of an arbitrary single - qubit optical state in the unified picture of nonclassicality and entanglement using the concept of ( standard ) entanglement potentials introduced in ref .",
    "the basis states of the analyzed optical qubits are the vacuum and single - photon states . in this approach",
    ", the nonclassicality of a single - qubit state is measured by the entanglement , which can be generated by the light combined with the vacuum on a balanced lossless beam splitter .",
    "we applied the most popular three measures of two - qubit entanglement for the states generated with this auxiliary beam splitter .",
    "specifically , we used the following standard entanglement potentials of a single - qubit state based on the negativity ( n ) , concurrence ( c ) , and the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) .",
    "we presented a comparative study of these entanglement potentials showing a counterintuitive result that an entanglement potential , for a given value of another entanglement potential , can be increased by phase and amplitude damping , as well as unbalanced beam splitting .",
    "the goal of this work was to find the maximal nonclassicality , corresponding to the maximal value of one entanglement potential for a fixed value of another entanglement potential , for ( i ) arbitrary two - qubit states and ( ii ) those states which can be generated from a single - qubit state and the vacuum via a balanced lossless beam splitter .",
    "we found that the maximal relative nonclassicality measured by the ree potential for a fixed value ( such that @xmath158 ) of the negativity potential can be increased by the amplitude damping of the output state of the balanced beam splitter or , equivalently , by replacing this beam splitter by a tunable lossless one .",
    "we also showed that the maximal nonclassicality measured by the negativity potential for a given value ( except the extremal values 0 and 1 ) of the ree potential can be increased by phase damping ( dephasing ) .",
    "thus , we introduced the concept of generalized entanglement potentials in analogy with the standard potentials , but by allowing unbalanced beam splitting or dissipation .",
    "of course , the entanglement itself is not increased by these losses ( since they act locally on the output ) , but the possible ratios of different measures are affected .",
    "the physical or operational meaning of the standard and generalized entanglement potentials is closely related to the corresponding standard entanglement measures .",
    "so , let us recall the operational meaning of the entanglement measures :    \\(i ) the negativity is a monotonic function of the logarithmic negativity , which has an operational meaning as a ppt entanglement cost , i.e. , the entanglement cost under the operations preserving the positivity of the partial transpose ( ppt )  @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic negativity is an upper bound to the entanglement of distillation @xmath159  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath159 quantifies the resources required to extract ( i.e. , distill ) the maximum fraction of the bell states from multiple copies of a given partially - entangled state .",
    "the negativity is also a useful estimator of entanglement dimensionality , i.e. , the number of entangled degrees of freedom of two subsystems  @xcite .",
    "then , we can interpret both standard and generalized negativity potentials as the entanglement potentials for the ppt entanglement cost and for estimating the entangled dimensions of the light in the beam - splitter outputs .",
    "\\(ii ) the concurrence is monotonically related to the entanglement of formation , @xmath160  @xcite , which quantifies the resources required to create a given entangled state  @xcite .",
    "thus , both standard and generalized concurrence potentials can also be interpreted as the potentials for the entanglement of formation .",
    "we note that the concurrence potential of a single - qubit state @xmath2 can also be interpreted  @xcite as a hillery - type nonclassical distance  @xcite , defined by the bures distance of @xmath2 to the vacuum .",
    "\\(iii ) the ree @xmath18 is a convenient geometric measure of the distinguishability of an entangled state from separable states .",
    "thus , both standard and generalized ree potentials can be used as measures of distinguishability of a nonclassical state from classical states .",

    "( [ eof ] ) .",
    "thus , the ree potential @xmath165 is an upper ( lower ) bound for the potential of the entanglement of distillation ( formation ) .",
    "analogous conclusions can be drawn for the generalized reep .",
    "thus , the maximal nonclassicality measured by the standard negativity potential for a given value of the standard ree potential can be exceeded ( except the values 0 and 1 ) by the corresponding generalized potentials .",
    "this conclusion can be rephrased in various ways by recalling multiple physical meanings of these potentials and the corresponding entanglement measures , as explained above .",
    "by contrast to these results , we found that the maximal relative nonclassicality can not be increased if it is measured by ( i ) the concurrence potential for any given value of the negativity potential , and vice versa , ( ii ) the concurrence potential for any fixed value of the ree potential , and vice versa , or ( iii ) the ree potential for a fixed value @xmath166 of the negativity potential .",
    "this is because that , for these three cases , the generated entanglement in the standard approach of ref .",

    "@xcite : `` although we currently lack of a general proof , all examples we checked analytically and numerically indicate that the transmissivity of the optimal bs is 1/2 independent of the input state . ''",
    "our examples indicate that not only the transmissivity @xmath167 can lead to higher nonclassicality , but also adding dissipation increases relative nonclassicality .",
