    "the tetragonal material mnau@xmath0 is one of the oldest known spin - spiral materials @xcite , with a nel temperature of @xmath5 @xcite and a local mn moment of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic ground state consists of in - plane ferromagnetic mn layers with a screw - type pattern around the tetragonal @xmath1 axis , which can be described using the spiral angle @xmath2 [ this is equivalent to the wave vector @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "neutron diffraction measurements @xcite find that @xmath2 has a weak dependence on temperature , increasing slightly with increasing temperature [ @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the spiral state is known to collapse to a metamagnetic fan - like configuration when placed in a @xmath11 magnetic field at room temperature @xcite , which led to a revival of interest in mnau@xmath0 when it was found that this gives rise to a giant magnetoresistive effect @xcite .",
    "there are several microscopic mechanisms that can induce spin spirals . in itinerant systems ,",
    "both fermi surface nesting @xcite and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction @xcite can lead to spiral formation .",
    "the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite , which occurs in materials without an inversion center ( mnau@xmath0 has an inversion center , which rules it out as a possible mechanism ) , can also induce spirals and moment canting , but due to the interaction s relativistic origin it is more important in materials with heavy elements .",
    "it can still be competitive in lighter transition metals , such as mnsi @xcite , but the spirals will have a long wavelength due to weak relativistic effects",
    ". finally , frustration , which can be geometric or magnetic , can encourage noncollinearity and lead to the formation of spirals .",
    "the spin spirals in mnau@xmath0 are understood to be a consequence of magnetic frustration , which is commonly modeled using a one - dimensional heisenberg model with first and second neighbor interplanar couplings ( the @xmath12 model ) @xcite . in this model , the spiral state is stable when @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite . the validity of applying this model to mnau@xmath0 was confirmed using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the origin of the magnetic frustration was traced to a competition between two exchange mechanisms , nearest - neighbor superexchange and a transferred rkky - like interaction , and electronic correlations were found to play an essential role in suppressing the rkky - like interaction , which is necessary to satisfy the @xmath15 inequality @xcite .",
    "the spiral angle @xmath2 is sensitive to pressure , with neutron diffraction measurements determining that @xmath16 decreases with applied pressure [ @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) decreasing to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) at a temperature of 295 k ( 77 k ) ] @xcite .",
    "measurements of the critical magnetic field @xmath21 for the spiral - to - ferromagnetic transition as a function of pressure , when extrapolated to zero external field , implied that the spiral state should collapse to ferromagnetism at @xmath22 kbar @xcite .",
    "the pressure - induced spiral - to - ferromagnetic transition was confirmed by subsequent experiments using inductance measurements @xcite , electrical resistivity measurements , and measurements of @xmath21 @xcite , although the two reports disagreed on the order of the phase transition . in ref .  , the transition is of the second kind and occurs over a pressure range of 12 - 20 kbar , while in ref .",
    "it is of the first kind and occurs at 13 kbar .",
    "this contradiction was never resolved and remained an open question .",
    "the @xmath12 heisenberg model , which can explain the stability of the spiral state , predicts that the transition must be of the second kind .",
    "however , general investigations of the classical one - dimensional heisenberg model show that including the third nearest - neighbor term @xmath23 leads to regions of parameter space with first order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "further neighbors , such as @xmath24 , change the area of parameter space where first - order transitions occur @xcite .",
    "it follows then that if a system were to sit near the boundary in parameter space separating first- and second - order phase transitions , then variations in material quality could shift the system towards one region or the other .",
    "we argue that this is the case for mnau@xmath0 .",
    "we support this claim using dft calculations to simulate the effects of pressure , charge doping , and variation in the strength of electronic correlations via a hubbard - like @xmath3 .",
    "we calculate the magnetic energies and fit them with a classical , one - dimensional heisenberg model with coupling between the first four nearest - neighbor mn planes .",
    "we confirm that ideal , stoichiometric mnau@xmath0 sits close to a boundary separating first- and second - order phase transitions , and that varying the pressure and doping shifts mnau@xmath0 across this critical boundary .",
    "this suggests that the two pressure experiments are not in conflict , but instead the mnau@xmath0 samples from each are located in two separate portions of phase space .",
    "the spiral angle @xmath2 is also found to be responsive to applied pressure and doping , which holds promise for integration of mnau@xmath0 into spintronic devices .",
    "we employed dft to solve the electronic structure of mnau@xmath0 and calculate the total energy of magnetic configurations . to perform these calculations",
    ", we used the all - electron code elk @xcite , which is an implementation of the full - potential linear augmented planewave method , and also projector augmented wave potentials implemented in the code vasp @xcite .",

    "do not find changes in the crystal structure prior to the spiral - to - ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "for this reason , we only investigate tetragonal unit cells and do not consider whether other structures become competitive at higher pressures , since they will not impact the phase transition .",
    "] we then fixed the volume and performed structural relaxations in vasp to optimize the @xmath39 ratio and the internal parameter @xmath40 .",
    "after the relaxation , we performed total energy calculations in vasp with the tetrahedron method and calculated the pressure using the formula @xmath41 .",
    "we then imported the relaxed structures into elk for calculating the magnetic energies .",
    "we employed two methods to simulate charge doping , ( 1 ) adding electrons directly to the system along with a uniform positive charge background ( hereafter referred to as `` charge dosing '' ) , and ( 2 ) using the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) .",
    "the vca involves replacing the au ions with fictitious ions of fractional charge in order to add electrons or holes to the system .",
    "we used the experimental lattice parameters of mnau@xmath0 in our doping calculations , while for calculations with simultaneous charge doping and applied pressure we used the relaxed cells obtained with vasp .",
    "we used the spin spiral method implemented in elk to calculate the total energy as a function of the spiral angle .",
    "this method defines a wave vector @xmath42 that is applied to a primitive cell to simulate spirals . in our previous study of mnau@xmath0 @xcite",
    ", we found good agreement between the calculated energies obtained via this method and noncollinear calculations of spirals in supercells . in this study ,",

    "we then used @xmath44 to convert the wave vector to an angle .",
    "convergence for the spin spiral calculations was carefully checked in the primitive cells , and the following parameters were necessary to achieve convergence : k - mesh = @xmath45 , nempty = 8 , rgkmax = 8.0 , gmaxvr = 12 , lmaxapw = 8 , and the smearing function width was set to 0.0001 ha .",

    "what has not been appreciated in previous studies of mnau@xmath0 is that this model can not explain how the turn angle could collapse under pressure in a first - order transition , as measured in ref .  .",
    "including the third nearest - neighbor coupling yields the @xmath53 model , which can be solved analytically ( see supplemental material @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath2 for this model as a function of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : heisenberg_model](b ) .",
    "there are two regions in the parameter space , the ferromagnetic region in the lower left and the spiral region in the rest of the diagram , with the contour plot corresponding to the magnitude of @xmath2 .",
    "the phase boundaries separating the two regions are @xcite : @xmath56 importantly , this model contains both first- and second - order phase transitions , which are distinguished by the kind of degeneracy that occurs on the borders in eq .  .",
    "a first - order phase transition occurs when there is a degeneracy between the ferromagnetic solution ( @xmath57 ) and a finite angle ( @xmath58 ) , while the second order phase transition corresponds to a smooth , continuous connection between ferromagnetic and spin - spiral regions , and is found by taking a second - order maclaurin series expansion of eq .   and equating it with the ferromagnetic solution in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "second - order transitions correspond with the @xmath60 result and are depicted as the thick white line in fig .",
    "[ fig : heisenberg_model](b ) , while first order transitions correspond to the @xmath61 result and are depicted as the thick black line . from this , it is clear that a small ferromagnetic coupling between third - neighbor planes ( relative to @xmath62 ) can change the order of the phase transition .",
    "the analysis is more complicated for four or more neighbor couplings since an analytic solution for @xmath2 is not available . despite this ,",
    "some properties can still be analytically solved ( see supplemental material @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "the phase boundary for second order transitions is @xmath63 .",
    "the criterion for a first order phase transition is @xmath64 note that the expression for the second order phase boundary and eq .",
    "are valid when @xmath65 .",
    "if one of the parameters is negative , then the expressions still hold as long as the antiferromagnetic couplings dominate @xcite , such as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "what s clear is that a relatively small fourth neighbor coupling can have a dramatic effect on the location of the first order and second order phase boundaries . to illustrate this",
    ", we numerically calculate the phase diagram for the @xmath4 model with @xmath69 , which we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : heisenberg_model](c ) . comparing panels ( b ) and ( c )",
    ", we clearly see that the length of the second order phase boundary ( white line ) has changed , despite the relative weakness of the fourth neighbor coupling .",
    "we also calculate the exchange parameters for ideal , stoichiometric mnau@xmath0 with @xmath27 , which are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath69 , and indicate where mnau@xmath0 sits with the white circle .",
    "the material sits very close to the first order transition , and a small variation in @xmath55 would drive the system towards ferromagnetism .    in fig .",

    "the contour plot shows the surface in @xmath74 , @xmath55 , @xmath75 space that separates ferromagnetic and spiral order .",
    "for example , if you calculate the exchange parameters for mnau@xmath0 and those parameters place the system `` inside '' the surface @xmath76 , then the ground state magnetic order is ferromagnetic .",
    "if instead the parameters place mnau@xmath0 on or outside the surface @xmath77 , then the magnetic order will be a spiral state .",
    "note that the light yellow region corresponding to @xmath78 means that the system has spiral order for all @xmath73 .",
    "finally , if you can tune the parameters , such as by applying pressure or adding holes / electrons , then the system can cross the surface and undergo a phase transition .    as we saw in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : heisenberg_model ] , phase transitions can either be first or second order . the parameters @xmath79 , @xmath75 control the kind of phase transition that occurs when you cross the surface depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : heisenberg_model](d ) .",
    "the red line separates the first- and second - order transition regions .",
    "if you cross the surface while north of the line , then the phase transition is second order ; if you cross the surface while south of the line , then the phase transition is first order .",
    "having established this , it is now instructive to indicate where ideal , stoichiometric mnau@xmath0 sits in @xmath79 , @xmath75 space for @xmath27 ( red star ) and @xmath80 ( white star ) . for both systems , @xmath81",
    ", so they have spiral order .",
    "what is striking here is how close mnau@xmath0 sits to the dividing line , especially when @xmath27 .",
    "this shows that changes in the exchange parameters induced through pressure , doping , or impurities could place the system north of the red line . since the system sits close to the dividing line , this could explain the discrepancy in experimental pressure studies discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "one final point to note is that this analysis assumed that the local moments always have an in - plane orientation .",

    ", it is less clear what would happen on the first order transition boundary , where zero and finite angle configurations are degenerate .",
    "we checked this possibility by considering conical solutions .",
    "we added a canted angle @xmath85 and a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy term to eq .  , @xmath86.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in this expression , the angles @xmath2 and @xmath85 remain decoupled and the solutions for @xmath2 are unaffected by canting and simple uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "if we now restrict ourselves to the first - order phase transition boundary , the energy difference between the conical spirals and the ferromagnetic configuration is @xmath87\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy there is a continuous degeneracy of the canting angle .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy term , although we should note that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameter is small , @xmath88 , and since the pressure experiments @xcite were performed at temperatures of 77 k and at room temperature , it is possible for the ferromagnetic orientation to align along the @xmath1 axis .",
    "it could also be used as a continuous pathway to make @xmath2 drop to zero ( at finite @xmath2 the moments can align parallel to @xmath1 while on the first - order boundary , and then as you move away from the boundary they can drop back to being in - plane with @xmath57 ) .",
    "this means that the phase transition may not be truly first order .",
    "however , it should be noted that such a transition entails a rapid change in the canting angle , which would be difficult to distinguish from a first - order transition in experiment . for the rest of the discussion",
    ", we will continue to refer to this as a first - order transition with the caveat that it may correspond to a rapid change in the canting angle .",
    "regardless , it remains distinct from the second - order transition , where @xmath2 continuously decreases to zero .",

    "charge dosing and vca doping have a stronger effect , where @xmath103 becomes more ferromagnetic with hole doping ( for @xmath80 , the coupling becomes enhanced at the large hole doping of -0.05 electrons per au ) and turns antiferromagnetic with electron doping .",

    "the arrows with text indicate the direction that the parametric curves evolve , so following the curve from the reference point in panel ( a ) shows how the parameters change with increasing pressure , in panels ( b ) and ( c ) one direction is electron doping and the other is hole doping , and for panel ( d ) @xmath3 decreases along the curve . if , while following the curve , the marker symbol changes from a star to a circle , this corresponds to a phase transition .",
    "if this change in symbols happens while south of the red line , then the phase transition is first order , and if it happens north of the red line , then it is a second order .    the parametric path for mnau@xmath0 under pressure in fig .",
    "[ fig : criticalparams](a ) shows that the spiral - to - ferromagnetic transition is first order for both values of @xmath3 .",
    "so , for ideal , stoichiometric mnau@xmath0 samples , we expect the pressure - induced phase transition to be of first order , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "decreasing @xmath3 at ambient pressure also induces a first order phase transition .",
    "in contrast , for our considered doping levels mnau@xmath0 does not collapse to the ferromagnetic state . doping with holes stabilizes the spiral state and drives the system deeper into the first - order parameter region , while doping with electrons moves mnau@xmath0 closer to ferromagnetism and also towards a second - order phase transition .",
    "also , the stronger the correlations , the more dramatic the shifts in parameter space with doping . for both @xmath27 and @xmath28 an electron doping of 0.05 electrons per au places the system at the dividing line between first and second order , and it would be expected that the application of pressure for this system would induce a second order transition .",
    ".values of the fitted exchange parameters for the simultaneous pressure and charge dosing calculations .",
    "results are for a charge dosing value of 0.07 electrons per au and @xmath27 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we check the prediction of inducing a second order phase transition by calculating the pressure dependence of mnau@xmath0 with @xmath27 and a charge dosing level of 0.07 electrons per au .",
    "the exchange parameters obtained from these calculations are reported in table [ tab : charge_pressure_exchange_parameters ] and the scaled exchange parameters , pressure dependence of @xmath2 , and a parametric plot of the exchange parameters are plotted in fig .",

    "[ fig : charge_and_dosing](c ) shows that the charge - dosed pressure - dependent path in exchange parameter space is north of the dividing line , confirming the prediction that applying pressure to electron doped mnau@xmath0 can induce a second - order phase transition .",
    "we can use the result that applying pressure to electron - doped mnau@xmath0 induces a second order phase transition to resolve the contradiction in the pressure experiments . in ref .",
    ", where the authors found a second order phase transition for mnau@xmath0 , they reported that there were trace amounts of mnau in their sample , such that the system was 34.3% mn and 65.7% au .",
    "this excess of mn in their sample can lead to an effective electron doping .",
    "let us assume that the excess mn atoms are also in the @xmath113 ionic charge state , and that the extra electrons they donate are spread homogeneously over the system .",
    "this would mean that each unit cell of mnau@xmath0 would have @xmath114 , or an excess of 0.03 electrons per au .",
    "assuming that @xmath27 yields a @xmath115 and a critical transition pressure @xmath116 , in reasonable agreement with experiment . ] and comparing with the electron dosing curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : criticalparams](b ) , an extra 0.03 electrons per au would shift the sample near the second order transition region of the parameter space , which as we ve seen can lead to a second order phase transition upon application of pressure . while the mnau domains are not likely to uniformly dope the material , we see how the variations in sample quality can influence the kind of phase transition .",
    "this both stresses the importance of controlling for impurities in mnau@xmath0 , and that the magnetic properties are also amenable to tuning .",
    "we studied how the magnetic exchange in mnau@xmath0 changes upon application of pressure and doping using a series of dft calculations , as well as varying the electronic correlations with a hubbard - like @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the proper model for these interactions is the one - dimensional heisenberg model with coupling between the first _ four _ mn planes ( the @xmath4 model ) , which contrasts with previous studies that only considered interactions between the first two planes . within this model ,",
    "transitions between the ferromagnetic and spiral phases can be either first or second order , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 control the order of the phase transition .",
    "our analysis finds that ideal , stoichiometric mnau@xmath0 sits near a dividing line in @xmath117 space that separates first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "applying pressure collapses the spiral state as expected , and for ideal , stoichiometric mnau@xmath0 the transition is first order .",
    "hole doping the material further stabilizes the spiral and the tendency towards a first - order transition .",
    "in contrast , electron doping the material makes the spiral less stable and moves the system in @xmath117 space closer to a second - order transition .",
    "we confirm with additional dft calculations that applying pressure to electron - doped mnau@xmath0 will induce a second - order phase transition .",
    "therefore , impurities that provide an effective electron doping , such as excess mn , can cause the spiral - to - ferromagnetic phase transition to become second order under pressure .",
    "these results indicate that mnau@xmath0 is tunable , where the kind of phase transition can be set and the spiral angle controlled through both pressure and doping , which can include gate voltages .",
    "the ability to control the spiral angle holds promise for integration of mnau@xmath0 in spintronics devices , such as in a spin valve . attaching a thin film of mnau@xmath0 to the free magnetic layer of a spin valve and then applying a gate voltage could allow for a current - free manipulation of the relative orientation between the free and pinned magnetic layers , which would reduce joule heating and could help in developing smaller - scale electronics devices",
