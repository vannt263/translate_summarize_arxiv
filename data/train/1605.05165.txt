    "there are two commonly used real time formalisms to describe a quantum field theory at finite temperature .",
    "the closed time path formalism @xcite uses the path integral method while thermofield dynamics @xcite has its origin in an operatorial description of thermal quantum field theory . unlike the imaginary time ( matsubara ) formalism @xcite , there is a doubling of field degrees of freedom in the real time formalisms @xcite which leads to a @xmath2 matrix structure for the propagator .",
    "thus , for example , the causal green s function ( the propagator without the factor of @xmath3 ) for a real , massive klein - gordon field has the momentum space representation in closed time path of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes the bose - einstein distribution function .",

    "the components have the explicit forms @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes the inverse temperature in units of the boltzmann constant .",
    "even though the off - diagonal parts of the green s functions in and have different forms in the two formalisms , they are known to lead to equivalent results for physical ensemble averages in thermal equilibrium .",

    "[ 1 ] where @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the path can be generalized even further , in principle , by adding pairs of alternating forward and backward moving real time branches , but it has been shown @xcite that such paths are equivalent to the general path shown in fig . [ 1 ] . when @xmath14 , the path is associated with the imaginary time ( matsubara ) formalism @xcite . on the other hand , for real time formalisms where time takes continuous values between @xmath15 ,",
    "one takes the limiting values @xmath16 and , for any allowed value of the parameter @xmath17 , the path leads to a real time description of the thermal field theory .",
    "when @xmath18 , we have the closed time path description discussed above while thermofield dynamics is associated with @xmath19 .    for any value of @xmath17 in the allowed range @xmath20 , there is a thermal field theory description and the @xmath2 matrix green s function has the form in the momentum space given by @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 where we have introduced @xmath23 we want to emphasize here that conventionally the two real branches of the path are labelled as @xmath9 for any nontrivial value of @xmath17 . only for @xmath24 ,",
    "namely , for the closed time path formalism , they are labelled as @xmath7 .",
    "even though for different values of @xmath17 the green s functions ( propagators ) are different , in thermal equilibrium they lead to equivalent physical results for any @xmath25 ( or @xmath17 ) @xcite as we will also show in a simple manner in appendix * a*.    thermal field theories defined on any one parameter ( @xmath17 ) family of paths can be given a diagrammatic ( path integral ) description .",
    "however , thermofield dynamics , corresponding to @xmath26 , also has an operator description .",
    "( in fact , thermofield dynamics has its origin in an operator description as we have already pointed out . )",
    "therefore , a natural question arises as to whether for other values of @xmath17 , we can also have an operator description of the theory in parallel to thermofield dynamics .",
    "( for example , an operator description of theories on the closed time path does not exist yet . )",
    "this has been a question of general interest since the work of umezawa _ et al _ @xcite . in spite of several attempts to find an operator description ,",
    "this remains an open question . in this paper , we study this question systematically and show that an operator description for any other value ( other than @xmath19 ) does exist indeed , with a modified inner product ( different from the standard dirac inner product ) for the thermal hilbert space .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a free massive klein - gordon theory in this study , but generalization to other theories is straightforward .    our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "* ii * , we recapitulate briefly the essential ideas of thermofield dynamics and describe the well studied bogoliubov transformation operator which takes the zero temperature ( doubled ) vacuum state to the thermal vacuum ( vacuum state in the thermal hilbert space ) .",
    "we also point out how this bogoliubov transformation leads to the green s function ( propagator ) in a factorizable matrix form . in section * iii * , we point out various symmetry properties of the green s function for an arbitrary ( allowed ) value of @xmath17 as well as its factorization which is quite useful in our attempt to construct the bogoliubov transformation relating the thermal vacuum to the zero temperature vacuum .",
    "in fact , in section * iv * , we use these features to construct the bogoliubov transformation ( operator ) for the arbitrary parameter @xmath12 which leads to the thermal hilbert space description of the theory .",
    "we point out how the inner product of the thermal space changes for @xmath27 and we show , in particular , in section * v * , how this description leads to the @xmath2 matrix green s function ( propagator ) for the klein - gordon theory in a factorized manner for an arbitrary parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in section * vi*. in appendix * a * , we give a simple derivation of the @xmath25 ( or @xmath17 ) independence of physical ensemble averages ( in thermal equilibrium ) in the operator formalism and point out various other features . in appendix * b * , we give a brief alternative ( but equivalent ) operator description leading to the green s function - .",
    "the main idea behind thermofield dynamics @xcite is the desire to define a thermal vacuum ( and a thermal hilbert space ) so that the ensemble average of any product of operators can be written as a thermal vacuum expectation value of the operators .",
    "namely , if there exists a state @xmath28 denoting the thermal vacuum state , then we should be able to write @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the dynamical hamiltonian for the system under study and @xmath31 stands for the partition function of the system . in this case , one can naturally develop a perturbative expansion much like at zero temperature .    with a little bit of analysis @xcite , it is realized that such a state can not be constructed if one restricts to the original hilbert space of the theory .",
    "rather , one needs to double the hilbert space of the theory by adding fictitious particles known as  tilde \" particles .",
    "let us illustrate this with the simple example of the one dimensional bosonic harmonic oscillator whose annihilation and creation operators are denoted by @xmath32 and satisfy the nontrivial commutation relation @xmath33 = \\mathbbm{1}.\\ ] ] for simplicity we assume that the hamiltonian of the oscillator corresponds to the one with vanishing zero point energy so that the discussion will naturally generalize to second quantized field theories .",
    "( having a nonvanishing zero point energy does not change the discussion . )",
    "namely , the hamiltonian for the system has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the natural frequency of the oscillator .",
    "next , we double the theory by adding  tilde \" degrees of freedom through the annihilation and creation operators @xmath36 which satisfy the same commutation relations as the original oscillator degrees of freedom , namely , @xmath37 = \\mathbbm{1}.\\ ] ] furthermore , the two degrees of freedom are assumed to be independent so that the  tilde \" operators commute with the original operators .",
    "the hamiltonian for the combined theory is denoted by @xmath38    in this doubled theory , the hilbert space is a product space of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 denote the energy states of the two harmonic oscillator systems ( namely , eigenstates of @xmath41 respectively ) .",
    "one can construct the thermal vacuum state in this doubled space in the form @xmath42 which is normalized by construction and leads to ensemble averages as thermal vacuum expectation values as desired ( see ) .",
    "the thermal vacuum @xmath28 can be shown to be related to the vacuum @xmath43 of the doubled space through a bogoliubov transformation @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the real parameter of the bogoliubov transformation @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 since the generator of the bogoliubov transformation is anti - hermitian @xmath48 it follows that the bogoliubov transformation is unitary , namely , @xmath49 it also follows from and that @xmath50 = 0,\\label{qprop3}\\ ] ] implying that the bogoliubov transformation defines a symmetry of the doubled theory .",
    "one can naturally define a thermal hilbert space built on the thermal vacuum state ( or ) .",
    "this is done by defining thermal annihilation and creation operators through the bogoliubov transformation in the following way .",
    "let us define a doublet of operators @xmath51 then , with the standard commutation relations it can be derived that the bogoliubov transformation leads to the thermal doublet of operators @xmath52 where the @xmath2 matrix @xmath53 mixes up the original and the  tilde \" operators under the bogoliubov transformation and defines the thermal operators which act on the thermal hilbert space .",
    "we note that @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the third pauli matrix .",
    "we note here that the thermal vacuum is annihilated by the thermal annihilation operators @xmath56 which leads to @xmath57 explicitly , and imply that the thermal vacuum satisfies @xmath58 which is known as the thermal state condition .",
    "all of these ideas from the simple example of the harmonic oscillator can be generalized to quantum field theories .",
    "the annihilation and creation operators as well as the transformation parameters simply become functions of momentum and one needs to integrate over the momentum where necessary . thus , for the free massive klein - gordon theory described by the field variable @xmath59 , we introduce the  tilde \" field degrees of freedom described by @xmath60 .",
    "( the  tilde \" conjugation rules @xcite in constructing the action for the doubled field , which we do not go into , not only replace the fields by the  tilde \" fields but also complex conjugate any coefficient . ) in this case , generalizes to @xmath61 where we have identified @xmath62    with the generator of bogoliubov transformation ( see - ) @xmath63 we can now define the thermal vacuum in the doubled space as @xmath64 where the parameters of transformation are given by @xmath65 we note here that the generator of the bogoliubov transformation is anti - hermitian so that @xmath66 is formally unitary @xmath67 furthermore , @xmath50 = 0,\\label{qprop3_1}\\ ] ] as in the harmonic oscillator case so that the bogoliubov transformation is a symmetry of the hamiltonian of the doubled system .    the unitary operator @xmath66 allows us to construct the thermal operators in the following way . if we define a doublet of the klein - gordon fields",
    "@xmath68 then with the tilde conjugation rules we can separate them into positive and negative frequency parts as @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( in the exponent ) and @xmath71 under a bogoliubov transformation , it can be checked that ( see , for example , and ) @xmath72 where the 2@xmath73 2 matrix @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 as in , we note that @xmath76 this shows that the matrices @xmath77 in and @xmath74 in belong to the group @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore , the thermal state condition generalizes in this case to @xmath79    using all these relations , the thermal @xmath2 matrix green s function ( propagator ) of thermofield dynamics can now be obtained as the expectation value in the thermal vacuum @xmath80 in fourier transformed space this leads to @xmath81 where the zero temperature green s function in thermofield dynamics has the simple form @xmath82 and @xmath74 is the @xmath2 matrix defined in .",
    "equation is an important result .",
    "it shows that the existence of a bogoliubov transformation leading to a thermal vacuum results in the factorization of the @xmath2 matrix green s function at finite temperature .",
    "in trying to construct a thermal vacuum for an arbitrary path ( @xmath17 arbitrary ) , various properties of the propagator can offer helpful clues . we have already noted the form of the green s function in and .",
    "the components of the @xmath2 matrix in @xmath83 have the explicit forms @xmath84 and as we have noted in , @xmath85 .",
    "we note from the forms of the components in that while @xmath86 for any arbitrary ( allowed ) @xmath17 , the off - diagonal elements , in general , satisfy @xmath87 only for @xmath19 ( or @xmath88 ) , the off - diagonal matrix elements are also symmetric under @xmath89 .",
    "thermofield dynamics , therefore , enjoys a very special status in that all the components of the propagator are symmetric under the reflection of the energy - momentum four vector .",
    "we will see later that this symmetry ( or lack of it ) is reflected in the structure of the thermal hilbert space of the theory .    as in the case of thermofield dynamics ( see and ) , the matrix @xmath90 can also be factorized @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , however , the factorizing matrix now depends on two parameters @xmath91 .",
    "namely , it can be checked that we can write @xmath92 where @xmath93 as we have noted in the last section , the existence of a bogoliubov transformation leading to a thermal vacuum results in the factorization of the propagator .",
    "therefore , from we feel that there should exist a thermal vacuum for an arbitrary @xmath17 which can be obtained from the ( doubled ) zero temperature vacuum through a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "however , from the form of the factorizing matrix , we note that , while the corresponding matrix in thermofield dynamics is symmetric ( under transposition ) , here we have @xmath94 as a result , it follows that , for an arbitrary @xmath17 , the factorizing matrix satisfies @xmath95 where @xmath55 is the third pauli matrix .",
    "this can be compared with and suggests that the bogoliubov transformation taking us to the thermal vacuum , if we can determine , may have some unusual features .",
    "the factorizing matrix @xmath96 in can be further factorized as @xmath97 where @xmath98 can be a @xmath2 matrix either in the diagonal form @xmath99 or in the off - diagonal form @xmath100 .",
    "we note that , in either case , we can write @xmath101 .",
    "this factorization in is very interesting because it points to the fact that the bogoliubov transformation leading to the thermal vacuum may involve a product of operators unlike the case in thermofield dynamics .    with all this information",
    ", we are ready to construct the bogoliubov transformation which naturally leads to the thermal vacuum of the theory and to discuss the resulting properties of the theory in the next section .",
    "the ensemble average of a product of operators @xmath102 in thermal equilibrium is defined as ( see , for example , ) @xmath103 where , as we have noted earlier , @xmath11 represents the inverse temperature in units of the boltzmann constant and @xmath31 is the partition function for the system .",
    "`` tr '' stands for trace over a complete set of states and @xmath30 denotes the dynamical hamiltonian of the system .    to introduce an operator description for a theory defined on the one parameter family of paths , we use the cyclicity of the trace to write @xmath104 where @xmath25 is defined in .",
    "( we note here that the cyclicity of the trace has been used earlier @xcite to introduce an arbitrary parameter into the ensemble average in a different context .",
    "the description in such a case has been called a non - hermitian representation of thermofield dynamics . )",
    "we note from and that the ensemble average of a product of operators can be written as the ( thermal ) vacuum expectation value in thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) @xmath105    at this point there are two equivalent ways of proceeding .",
    "we can either keep the doubled operators of thermofield dynamics and look for a modified thermal vacuum state that depends on the parameter @xmath25 in addition to @xmath11 ( temperature ) such that the ensemble average in can be written as an expectation value of the product of operators @xmath102 in this thermal vacuum .",
    "this would be the closest in spirit to thermofield dynamics . or ,",
    "alternatively , we can keep the thermal vacuum of tfd unmodified and look for new operators to describe the doubled theory to represent the ensemble average as an expectation value of the product of new operators in the tfd vacuum .",
    "this will be closer in spirit to having two real branches of the time path with an arbitrary separation of the imaginary argument .",
    "in the main text of the paper , we will follow the first approach in detail while in appendix * b * we will discuss briefly the alternative approach .    using the definition of the thermal vacuum in tfd , @xmath28 , in",
    "( see also ) , we can write the ensemble average also as @xmath106 where we have used the property @xmath107 .",
    "equation suggests that we can define a new bogoliubov transformation operator , @xmath108 , which depends on two parameters and is related to the unitary operator @xmath66 of tfd by a similarity transformation as @xmath109 this is quite reminiscent of the factorization in and so , in principle , one can define a thermal vacuum depending on two parameters ( for the theory on the arbitrary path ) through this operator @xmath108 , namely , @xmath110 however , there seems to be a problem with this in that the operator @xmath108 is not naively unitary ( as we would expect for a bogoliubov transformation to be ) , namely , since from @xmath111 it follows that @xmath112 as a result , the ensemble average in can not be written as a thermal vacuum expectation value as in thermofield dynamics ( see ) .",
    "however , we also note from the definition in that @xmath113 which is reminiscent of .",
    "the resolution of this problem can be understood as follows and occurs in several areas of physics , most recently in the study of @xmath114 symmetric theories @xcite and in pseudo - hermitian systems @xcite .",
    "basically , properties such as hermiticity and unitarity are defined with respect to the inner product of a hilbert space .",
    "the conventional adjoint @xmath115 of an operator @xmath116 is defined with respect to the standard dirac inner product @xmath117 . on the other hand , with a modified inner product defined as @xcite @xmath118 the modified adjoint @xmath119",
    "is defined through the similarity transformation @xcite @xmath120    therefore , if we choose @xmath121 to correspond to the reflection operator @xmath122 we have @xmath123 similarly from we note that the adjoint with respect to the modified inner product leads to @xmath124 so that ( see ) @xmath125 namely , the bogoliubov transformation is formally unitary , as it should be , but with respect to the modified inner product in .",
    "it follows now that @xmath126 so that the thermal vacuum is indeed normalized with respect to the modified product . furthermore , the ensemble average can indeed be written as a thermal vacuum expectation with this modified product , @xmath127 this brings out a very important feature of the thermal hilbert space . namely , when @xmath128 , the thermal hilbert space develops a natural modified inner product different from the standard dirac inner product . only for @xmath129 ( or @xmath26 )",
    ", namely , only for thermofield dynamics does the hilbert space coincide with the one with a standard dirac inner product . in this sense",
    "thermofield dynamics enjoys a very special status in an operatorial description .",
    "since the bogoliubov transformation @xmath108 is formally unitary with respect to the modified inner product ( see ) , operators transform under such a transformation preserving their commutation relations .",
    "thus , for example , if we consider the free massive klein - gordon theory described by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is defined in .",

    "the bogoliubov transformation leading to the thermal vacuum and the thermal hilbert space can be written in a closed form for the free massive klein - gordon theory in the following way .",
    "let us denote @xmath137 where @xmath30 is given in , @xmath138 is the generator of the bogoliubov transformation for thermofield dynamics noted in and @xmath139 denotes the generator of the bogoliubov transformation for an arbitrary @xmath17 .",
    "the three exponents in can be combined using the baker - cambell - hausdorff formula leading to @xmath140 it is clear that the generator @xmath139 is manifestly anti - hermitian with respect to the modified product , namely , @xmath141 so that ( or ) follows .",
    "furthermore , it also follows from that ( see also ) @xmath142 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the hamiltonian for the doubled theory given in .    as in",
    "- we can decompose the doublet of fields into positive and negative frequency parts as @xmath144 where the positive and negative frequency wave functions ( solutions of the klein - gordon equation ) are given by @xmath145 with @xmath70 in the exponent and @xmath146 it is now straightforward to check that they transform under a bogoliubov transformation as @xmath147 where @xmath148 it follows from that the thermal state condition , in this case , has the form @xmath149    the @xmath2 matrix has the same form as , which appears in the factorization of the propagator , except that the off - diagonal exponent has @xmath150 instead of @xmath151 which can be positive as well as negative ( there is no @xmath151 dependence , only dependence on @xmath152 on the left hand side in ) .",
    "this is different from the case of thermofield dynamics ( see , for example , and ) .    to see how arises let us calculate the thermal @xmath2 matrix propagator as a thermal vacuum expectation",
    "let us recall that @xmath153 we recall from that @xmath154 as well as @xmath155 .",
    "furthermore , introducing a factor of unity , @xmath156 , between @xmath157 and @xmath158 , we can use the relations derived in .",
    "finally , we can use the identities involving the positive and negative frequency wave functions , namely , @xmath159 which brings in the @xmath151 dependence into the calculation .",
    "with all these relations as well as the vacuum state conditions @xmath160 a straightforward calculation yields @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the propagator ( green s function ) in the momentum space which has the naturally factorized matrix form ( as in thermofield dynamics ) @xmath163 with @xmath96 given in . basically , the relation changes the matrix @xmath164 in to @xmath165 in .",
    "we also point out here that , with the modified inner product , relation implies that the matrix @xmath166 belongs to the group @xmath78 just like the factorizing matrix in thermofield dynamics .",
    "in this paper we have shown systematically that an operator description for a theory defined on a real time path with an arbitrary @xmath17 does indeed exist .",
    "we have constructed the bogoliubov transformation which connects the doubled vacuum state at zero temperature to the generalized thermal vacuum .",

    "the factorizing matrix , @xmath96 , belongs to the group @xmath78 , but only with the modified inner product .",
