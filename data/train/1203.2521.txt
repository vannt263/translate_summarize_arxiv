    "the role played by short - range repulsive interactions has been revived more recently , with a series of experiments discussing the possible onset of a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state in two - component ultracold fermi gases . in an initial work , jo _ et al . _",

    "@xcite , the existence of a ferromagnetic transition in the same system is ruled out , arguing that very fast molecule formation leads to local heating and to a pairing instability , destroying the ultracold nature of the gas .",
    "they even conclude that short range repulsive interactions with fermionic species can possibly not be realized in nature .",
    "the existence of a ferromagnetic phase in dilute , ultracold fermi gases interacting through short - range repulsive forces has also been discussed in recent theoretical works , triggered by the previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "positive scattering lengths can be achieved by moving along the upper branch of a feshbach resonance associated to an attractive short - range interaction once a bound state is formed , or by increasing the range of an overall repulsive potential .",
    "these two mechanisms lead to different physical situations , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , when a description based only on the scattering length is not enough .",
    "however , in both cases it can be argued that when the system is so dilute that the scattering length and the range of the potential are small compared to the interparticle distance , only @xmath2-wave scattering processes are relevant . under these conditions ,",
    "all higher order partial waves can be discarded in the description of the many - body syste . in any case and motivated by the previous experiments , the question of whether a ferromagnetic transition takes place in ultracold fermi gases has achieved revived interest recently .",

    "@xcite the authors find that a transition exists in different systems of harmonically trapped repulsive fermions , while similar conclusions regarding infinite systems are reported in refs .",
    "in other works , the existence of a transition is either ruled out or argued to depend on the details of the system analyzed  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we address this problem again and analyze the possible onset of a ferromagnetic transition in a system of fermions interacting through purely repulsive , short ranged forces .",
    "we believe that the question of weather a system of repulsive fermions can undergo a ferromagnetic transition is still relevant even though in actual experiments the high @xmath7 limit is usually reached by moving along the upper branch of a feshbach resonance .",
    "in the case of a fully polarized fermi system , @xmath2-wave scattering is forbidden by the pauli principle , and thus the total energy equals the corresponding kinetic energy of the underlying fermi sea if the density is low enough . in a non - polarized medium , @xmath2-wave scattering between particles with the same spin orientation",
    "is also suppressed but not between atoms of different spin .",
    "all that information can be collected in the following , effective opposite - spin - channel ( osc ) hamiltonian @xmath8 with @xmath9 the mass of each of the @xmath10 atoms , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the number of particles with spin up and spin down , respectively .",
    "the stoner model  @xcite corresponds to a mean - field approach to this hamiltonian when the interaction is replaced by a two - body pseudopotential with a coupling constant proportional to the @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath3 .",
    "as commented above , this model has been taken as the starting point in recent theoretical analysis of the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "contact interactions in standard monte carlo simulations of dilute quantum gases are usually replaced by model potentials of finite range tuned to reproduce the desired values of scattering parameters .",
    "one of the fully - repulsive potential models commonly used to study low - density properties of degenerate quantum gases is the hard - sphere interaction , @xmath13 with an @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath3 equal to the core diameter @xmath14 , which been used recently in refs .",

    "when a finite range potential is explored , higher order partial waves produce contributions that show up when the diluteness condition of the gas is not fulfilled . in this case the osc model , which explicitly restricts this possibility , shows its limitations . when applied to the experiment with @xmath4li atoms of ref .",

    "we study the possible onset of a ferromagnetic transition in a spin 1/2 fermi gas of hard spheres ( i.e. a two - component fermi gas ) using existing low - density expansions of the energy per particle and a variational approach in the framework of the fermi hypernetted chain equations ( fhnc )  @xcite . as we do not restrict the analysis to the weakly interacting regime , we allow for the contribution of scattering in all partial waves by adopting a more general hamiltonian of the form @xmath17 where indexes @xmath18 and @xmath19 label spin - up and spin - down particles , respectively .",
    "we stick to the case where the two - body interaction does not distinguish between different spin configurations , but explicitly include interactions between spins with the same orientation , in contrast to the osc model .",

    "it is however possible to obtain a prediction for the osc model if the leading terms in the expansion are renormalized accordingly .",
    "the osc model discards interactions between particles with the same spin orientation , which in a first approximation can be thought as forming pairs in a triplet state of total spin @xmath57 .",

    "accordingly , one may conclude that the low density expansions given above are valid in the whole range of @xmath7 values considered , and that both @xmath2- and @xmath38-wave scattering processes contribute significantly to the total energy per particle when @xmath7 increases .",
    "assuming then that the above low density expansions provide a good description of the energy per particle of the polarized and unpolarized systems at @xmath61 , one can draw several conclusions from the different curves in fig .",
    "[ figstefano ] .",
    "for instance , one sees from the figure that the @xmath52 terms add important contributions to @xmath62 . adding only @xmath52 terms to the @xmath2-wave rises the energy per particle slightly , but the most significant effect appears when the @xmath38-wave contributions are added , bringing the violet dotted line into the black solid line corresponding to the prediction for the full model of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian_full ] ) . therefore , adding @xmath42wave effects is more important than dressing the @xmath41wave contributions by including the effective range terms .",
    "furthermore , the good agreement between the monte carlo predictions and the properly modified low - density expansion for the osc model , indicates that while @xmath38-wave contributions are important , no higher order partial waves contribute significantly , as these are not included in the expansion .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath2- and @xmath38-wave processes are the only ones that contribute significantly .",
    "it is also apparent from fig .",
    "[ figstefano ] that the universal behavior , where all predictions yield essentially the same , ceases to be valid already at @xmath63 , quite below the value @xmath61 where the simulations based on the osc model predict the transition to the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the figure also indicates that the energy per particle of the polarized gas starts to deviate from the constant prediction , valid when only @xmath2-wave scattering is considered , at about the same value @xmath64 . once again , at @xmath61 @xmath38-wave contributions introduce significant corrections that can not be neglected .",
    "we thus conclude that , at least for the hard - sphere fermi gas , the low density expansions set the limit of validity of the osc model at @xmath65 .    knowing the limits of the osc model , the next step in our discussion is to analyze the results provided by the full hamiltonian @xmath58 of eq .",

    "on the one hand , it is remarkable the fact that while the low density expansion for the unpolarized system is everywhere close to the full many - body calculations , this is not the case for the polarized system , which overestimates the total energy per particle of the gas when @xmath77 .",
    "on the other , while the low density expansion predictions do not cross in the range of densities analyzed , our many - body calculations show that the energy per particle of the polarized system decreases at a higher rate than the corresponding one for the unpolarized gas .",
    "it is also remarkable to notice that the total energy per particle of both systems noticeably depends on the quality of the wave function employed .",
    "as expected , the one including backflow correlations provides lower variational estimations . in any case , the inclusion of backflow correlations not only lowers the energies , but also pushes the ferromagnetic transition to a higher density , identified by the point in the figure where the energy of the paramagnetic state equals that of the ferromagnetic phase ( a sufficient condition that determines a point @xmath78 where the ferromagnetic phase is preferred ) .",
