    "recent experimental demonstrations of bose - einstein condensation in dilute low - temperature trapped alkali gases @xcite rapidly stimulated detailed theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of the lowest - lying normal modes .",
    "these latter experiments confirmed the essential applicability of the bogoliubov approximation @xcite , which assumes that most of the particles remain in the self - consistent condensate for temperatures well below the bose - einstein condensation temperature .",
    "although bogoliubov s original work described only a uniform system , the formalism was soon extended to a vortex line @xcite and other more general nonuniform configurations @xcite .    in a harmonic trap with anisotropic frequencies @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) ,",
    "an ideal - bose - gas condensate would have characteristic dimensions @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the atomic mass .",

    "the kinetic energy of a particle in the condensate is negligible relative to the trap potential energy and the repulsive interparticle potential energy , leading to the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation for the condensate density @xcite .",
    "this limit occurs when the condensate number @xmath11 is much larger than the ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the effective @xmath14-wave interatomic scattering length ( typically @xcite @xmath15 a few @xmath16 , @xmath17 a few nm , and the experimental value @xmath18 amply satisfies the tf criterion that @xmath19 ) . in the tf regime ,",
    "the expansion ratio is given by @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the normal modes of a nonuniform condensate can be described with either the pair of quantum - mechanical quasiparticle amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 that obey the coupled bogoliubov equations @xcite , or the equivalent hydrodynamic amplitudes for the fluctuations @xmath23 in the particle density and @xmath24 in the velocity potential @xcite . in the tf limit ,",
    "the latter description simplifies considerably for the low - lying normal modes , allowing accurate predictions of lowest eigenfrequencies of an axisymmetric trapped condensate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the creation and detection of a vortex in a trapped bose condensate remains relatively unexplored .",
    "the condensate density for a vortex line on the axis of an axisymmetric harmonic potential has been evaluated both numerically @xcite and with the tf approximation @xcite . using the bogoliubov equations in the tf limit",

    ", the vortex core radius @xmath27 is small compared to both the mean oscillator length @xmath28 and the mean dimension @xmath9 of the condensate .",
    "the resulting hydrodynamic equations then yield a perturbative treatment of the normal - mode eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions for the density fluctuations , in which the vortex s circulating velocity splits the degenerate unperturbed eigenfrequencies with azimuthal angular momentum @xmath29 by a relative amount of order @xmath30 , largely confirming sinha s conclusion @xcite based on the bogoliubov equations ( for @xmath0 , however , we find additional terms which ensure that the shift vanishes for the lowest dipole mode ) .",
