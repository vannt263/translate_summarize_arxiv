    "the possibility to cancel the linear absorption in resonant atomic systems by means of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite lead in recent years to fascinating new developments in nonlinear optics @xcite . for example coherently driven , resonant atomic vapors under conditions of eit allow for complete frequency conversion in distances short enough , such that phase matching requirements become irrelevant @xcite .",
    "furthermore the large nonlinearities of these systems may lead to a new regime of nonlinear quantum optics on the few - photon level @xcite with potential applications to single - photon quantum control @xcite and quantum information processing .",
    "one particularly interesting nonlinear process based on eit is the resonantly enhanced 4-wave mixing in a double-@xmath0 system with counter - propagating pump modes @xcite .",
    "it has been shown experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite that this system can show a phase transition to mirrorless oscillations for rather low pump powers .",
    "close to the threshold of oscillation an almost perfect suppression of quantum fluctuations of one quadrature amplitude of a combination mode of the generated fields occurs @xcite . also sufficiently above threshold light fields with beat - frequencies",
    "tightly locked to the atomic raman - transition and extremely low relative bandwidth are generated @xcite .",
    "all previous studies of resonantly enhanced 4-wave mixing were done in the perturbative regime of small amplitudes of the generated fields . in the present paper",
    "i want to discuss the case of arbitrary amplitudes .",
    "using a simplified open - system model i will derive stationary propagation equations for the field amplitudes and present analytic solutions of these equations .",
    "it will be shown that in an ideal case complete conversion can be achieved within a relatively small interaction length .",
    "i here consider the propagation of four electromagnetic waves in a medium consisting of double-@xmath0 atoms ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "these waves include two counter - propagating driving fields with equal frequencies @xmath1 and rabi - frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and two probe fields ( anti - stokes and stokes ) described by the complex rabi - frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with carrier frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the ground - state frequency splitting .",
    "the fields interact via the long - lived coherence on the dipole - forbidden transition between the metastable ground states @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the driving field @xmath11 is in resonance with the @xmath12 transition , whereas the second driving field @xmath13 has a detuning @xmath14 from the @xmath15 transition . in this case",
    "linear losses of the fields due to single - photon absorption processes are minimized .",
    "configuration interacting with two driving fields ( @xmath16 ) and two generated fields ( @xmath17 ) ]    due to coherent raman - scattering the pump fields generate counter - propagating anti - stokes and stokes fields . for a sufficiently large density - length product of the medium and for a certain pump field",
    "intensity , the system shows a phase - transition to self - oscillations @xcite . the feedback mechanism required for an oscillation is provided here by the gain medium",
    ": a stokes photon spontaneously generated on the @xmath18 transition propagates in the @xmath19 direction and stimulates the generation of an anti - stokes photon .",
    "this anti - stokes photon has a different frequency but a fixed relative phase and propagates in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "it stimulates the generation of another stokes photon upstream .",
    "the second stokes photon will be in phase with the first one , provided that the system is approximatly phase matched and that there has been no decay of the raman coherence . the phase - locked emission of the second stokes photon then closes the feedback loop .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that phase - matching enforces a strong pulling of the beat - note of generated and pump fields to the atomic raman transition .",
    "i will therefore assume here that both @xmath0 systems are in perfect two - photon resonance .    in order to calculate the medium response to the fields",
    ", one would have to solve the atomic density matrix equations to all orders in all fields taking into account all relaxation rates .",
    "although this is in principle possible it leads to extremely involved expressions .",
    "instead i here use a simplified open - system model which allows to derive rather compact expressions for the atomic susceptibilities .    since the effects of spontaneous emission are negligible in the present system , we may model all relaxations out of the excited states @xmath21 and @xmath22 by rates @xmath23 out of the system . in thermal equilibrium , i.e. in the absence of all fields , both lower states @xmath9 and @xmath10 are equally populated .",
    "i therefore assume  within the open - system approach  that the atoms are pumped into states @xmath9 or @xmath10 with 50% probability respectively .",
    "the corresponding rate is denoted as @xmath24 and will later be determined by the requirement that the total probability to find an atom in any of the states is unity .",
    "the finite lifetime of the lower - level coherence will here be described by a decay out of all states with rate @xmath25 .",
    "thus the open - system model corresponds to the experimentally relevant situation of an atomic beam or a finite - temperature vapor with time - of - flight broadening . in this case",
    "the system can be described by generalized schrdinger - equations for field amplitudes instead of density - matrix equations .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of an atom at position @xmath26 with the fields can be written in the form @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we denote the state vector of the atom as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the energies of the corresponding states , we find the following equations of motion of the slowly - varying state amplitudes for an atom at position @xmath26 @xmath30 here i have introduced the rates @xmath31 and @xmath32 to distinguish the cases of pumping into @xmath9 ( @xmath33 ) and into @xmath10 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that simultaneously setting @xmath35 corresponds to a _",
    "coherent _ preparation of the atoms in a 5050 superposition of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in order to describe an _",
    "incoherent _ preparation in these levels one has to consider the two cases separately and add the density matrix elements following from both cases .    solving ( [ a1][b2 ] ) in steady state for the case of injection into @xmath9 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath36 and @xmath37 one finds @xmath38 where i have used that @xmath39 and have kept only the leading terms .",
    "similarly one finds for injection into @xmath10 , i.e. for @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 taking into account only the leading order contribution in the above expressions is essentially equivalent to assuming an infinitely long lived ground - state coherence between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in vapor cells with coated walls or by using buffer gases , lifetimes of hyperfine coherences in alkali vapors in the millisecond regime",
    "are possible . hence neglecting contributions from finite values of @xmath25",
    "seems justified .",
    "however , in this case also linear absorption losses are neglected .",
    "as a consequence the threshold condition becomes independent on the pump intensity and an arbitrarily small flux of pump photons is sufficient to maintain oscillations @xcite .",
    "if on the other hand a small but finite ground - state dephasing rate is taken into account , the threshold condition does depend on the pump intensity leading to a lower limit of the pump - photon flux . in the present paper",
    "i am interested only in the analytic behavior of the fields in the ideal limit and therefore the small but finite linear losses associated with the ground - state dephasing will be ignored .",
    "the pump rate @xmath24 can be determined from the normalization condition @xmath43 .",
    "one finds @xmath44.$ ] with this one obtains for the non - diagonal density matrix elements @xmath45 : @xmath46 the first terms in these expressions describe the nonlinear coupling between the modes and the second ones ac - stark shift induced changes in the refractive indices .",
    "it should be noted that there are no imaginary linear susceptibilities , i.e. there is no linear dissipation despite the fact , that @xmath11 and @xmath4 are in single - photon resonance .",
    "in slowly - varying amplitude and phase approximation , the field amplitudes obey the following equation of motion @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the free - space wavenumbers of the generated and pump fields , @xmath51 is the atomic number density and @xmath52 are the dipole moments of the corresponding transitions , which have been assumed to be equal for simplicity . since the wavenumbers of the fields differ only slightly , one may approximate the coupling parameter in all equations by @xmath53 . introducing field amplitudes which are slowly varying in space , @xmath54 and",

    "one easily verifies that the set of differential equations has always the trivial solution @xmath62 , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "as has been discussed in detail in @xcite , the phase mismatch is easily compensated in an optically dense vapor by a small detuning from the two - photon resonance .",
    "oscillation occurs at frequencies such that the phase - matching condition is automatically fulfilled .",
    "i therefore set this term equal to zero in the following .",
    "the field equations have the following constants of motion . from the energy - momentum conservation follow the manley - rowe relations @xmath65 which state that each photon taken out of the pump fields @xmath11 or @xmath13 is put into the anti - stokes and stokes fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "furthermore one finds that the total intensity of the pump field is constant in space @xmath66 the same is true for the generated fields , which however follow already from the above constants of motion . @xmath67 without the phase terms in ( [ e1][o2 ] ) , which represent contributions due to ac - stark shifts , also the quartic expression @xmath68 $ ] would be a constant of motion .",
    "in fact the boundary conditions for the generated fields imply that @xmath68\\equiv 0 $ ] . it will be shown later on that @xmath68 $ ] is in any case to a very good approximation a constant of motion .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the field equations in terms of amplitudes and phases . introducing @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 )",
    "one obtains @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the relative phase between the fields .",

    "let me now consider the case of equal input intensities of both pump fields , i.e. @xmath75 . making use of the constants of motion one can write @xmath76 with the output amplitude of the generated fields @xmath77 and the mixing angle @xmath78 as the only remaining variables .",
