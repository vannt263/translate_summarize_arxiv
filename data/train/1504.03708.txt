    "we here present a first - principles study of the conformational preferences of their basic building blocks  specifically , as summarized in figure  [ fig : aa_scheme ] : 20 proteinogenic amino acids and dipeptides , with different possible protonation states , and the conformational space changes resulting from attaching six divalent cations , i.e. , ca@xmath0 , ba@xmath0 , sr@xmath0 , cd@xmath0 , pb@xmath0 , and hg@xmath0 . in past studies , a wide range of different approximate electronic structure methods has been applied to some of these proteinogenic amino acids  see , for example , references @xcite .",
    "these studies have deepened our understanding of the conformational basics of individual building blocks , but a systematic comparison of properties of the different building blocks is complicated when relying on data from different sources . on the one hand",
    "this is due to the molecular models that may differ in protonation states and backbone capping . on the other",
    ", the simulations can differ in several ways :    * different sampling strategies or methods to generate conformers may have been used .",
    "search - dependent settings , like energy cut - offs , can also have a significant impact on the results . *",
    "the levels of theory that have been applied range from semi - empirical to hartree - fock ( hf ) to density - functional theory ( dft ) up to coupled - cluster calculations @xcite .",
    "* numerical settings , e.g. , basis sets , can differ substantially and might lead to different results .    a further point that limits a quantitative comparison is the accessibility of the data from different studies .",
    "energies , for example , often have to be extracted from table footnotes and/or the structural data is not always accessible in the supporting information of the respective articles , sometimes even only accessible as figures in the manuscript .",
    "the data set presented here overcomes such limitations by covering a comprehensive segment of chemical space exhaustively , using a large scale computational effort .",
    "this study treats 20 proteinogenic amino acids , their dipeptides and their interactions with the divalent cations ca@xmath0 , ba@xmath0 , sr@xmath0 , cd@xmath0 , pb@xmath0 , and hg@xmath0 ( see figure  [ fig : aa_scheme ] for an overview ) on the same theoretical footing .",
    "the importance of peptide cation interactions may be highlighted by the fact that about 40% of all proteins bind cations@xcite .",
    "especially ca@xmath0 is important in a multitude of functions , ranging , for example , from blood clotting@xcite to cell signaling to bone growth@xcite .",
    "such calcium mediated functions can be disturbed by the presence of alternative divalent heavy metal cations like pb@xmath0 , cd@xmath0 , and hg@xmath0@xcite .",

    "the empirical force field opls - aa @xcite was employed , followed by dft - pbe+vdw relaxations of the energy minima identified in the force field .",
    "the identified set of structures was then subjected to a further first - principles refinement step , _ ab initio _ replica - exchange molecular dynamics ( remd ) .",
    "an overview of the procedure is given in figure  [ fig : workflow ] and the steps are described in more detail below .",
    "force - field based ( opls - aa ) @xcite * global conformational searches ( step  1 ) * were performed for all dipeptides and amino acids ( i ) without a coordinating cation and ( ii ) with ca@xmath0 .",
    "these searches employed a basin hopping search strategy@xcite as implemented in the tool `` scan '' , distributed with the tinker molecular simulation package @xcite .",

    "the search terminates when the relaxations of input structures do not result in new minima .",
    "after that , * pbe+vdw relaxations ( step  2 ) * were performed with the program fhi - aims @xcite .",
    "fhi - aims employs numeric atom - centered orbital basis sets as described in reference @xcite to discretize the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "different levels of computational defaults are available , distinguished by choice of the basis set , integration grids , and the order of the multipole expansion of the electrostatic ( hartree ) potential of the electron density . for the chemical elements relevant to this work ,",

    ". starting geometries for the replicas were taken from the lowest energy conformers resulting from the pbe+vdw relaxations in step 2 .",
    "remd parameters for the individual systems , i.e. the number of replicas , acceptance rates for exchanges between replicas , the frequency for exchange attempts , and the temperature range , are summarized in table s1 of the supporting material .",
    "conformations were extracted from the remd trajectories every 10th step , i.e. every 10fs of simulation time . in order to generate a set of representative conformers ,",
    "these structures were clustered using a @xmath5-means clustering algorithm@xcite with a cluster radius of 0.3 as provided by the mmstb package@xcite .",
    "the resulting arithmetic - mean structures from each cluster were then relaxed using pbe+vdw with `` light '' computational settings .",
    "the obtained conformers were again clustered and cluster representatives were relaxed with pbe+vdw ( `` tight '' computational settings ) to obtain the final conformation hierarchies .",
    "the refinement step by remd is essential , as shown in figure  [ fig : howmany ] , which separately identifies the number of distinct conformers found in step  2 and , subsequently , the number of additional conformers found in step  3 .",
    "after step 2 , a total of 17,381 stationary points was found for the amino acids and dipeptides in isolation and in complex with ca@xmath0 .",
    "the refinement procedure in step 3 increases this number to a total of 21,259 structures .",
    "initial structures for the ba@xmath0 , cd@xmath0 , hg@xmath0 , pb@xmath0 and sr@xmath0 binding amino acid and dipeptide systems were then obtained by replacing the ca@xmath0 cation in the amino acid and dipeptide structures binding a ca@xmath0 cation .",
    "these structures were subsequently relaxed with pbe+vdw employing `` tight '' computational settings and a tier-2 basis set .",

    "the conformational coverage for the amino acid alanine is validated by comparing to a recent study by maul _ _ et al.__@xcite . in that reference ,",
    "10 low energy conformers of alanine were reported , spanning an energy range of approximately 0.26ev between the reported lowest and highest energy conformers .",
    "the level of theory used by maul _",
    "_ was dft in the generalized gradient approximation by means of the perdew - wang 1991 functional@xcite .",
    "in our case , the force field based search step with subsequent pbe+vdw relaxations yields 5 conformers .",
    "the following _ ab initio _ remd simulations increase the number of conformers to 15 within an energy range of 0.43ev .",
    "the respective conformational energy hierarchies after global search and after remd - refinement are shown in figure  [ ala_example]a .",

    "nine of the ten conformers identified by maul _",
    "_ can be confirmed .",
    "the single conformer that is missing ( highlighted by an x in figure  [ ala_example]a ) is not a stationary point of the pbe+vdw potential energy surface .",
    "conformers 14 and 15 are classified as saddle points by analysis of the vibrational modes .    in order to further quantify the reliability of the dft - pbe+vdw level of theory for peptides , beyond earlier benchmark work@xcite and especially with divalent cations ,",
    "benchmark calculations were performed at the level of mller - plesset second - order perturbation theory ( mp2 ) @xcite using the electronic structure program package orca @xcite .",
    "single - point energy calculations were performed for all fixed stationary - point dft - pbe+vdw geometries in our data base for the amino acids alanine ( ala ) and phenylalanine ( phe ) with neutral n and c termini in isolation as well as in complex with a ca@xmath0 cation .",
    "phe was selected to represent a `` difficult '' example , i.e. , the interaction of the cation with a larger aromatic side chain .",
    "the mp2 calculations did not include any frozen - core treatment ( including semicore states is essential for ca@xmath0 ) and were performed using dunning s correlation - consistent polarized core - valence basis sets ( cc - pcvnz ) , with n = t / q/5 denoting the triple - zeta , quadruple - zeta , and quintuple - zeta basis sets respectively @xcite . the calculated scf ( hartree - fock ) and mp2 correlation energies",
    "were then individually extrapolated to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit as follows : for scf energies , we used the extrapolation strategy proposed by karton and martin @xcite : @xmath6 + @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the cbs - extrapolated energy @xmath9 are parameters determined from a least - squares fitting algorithm applied individually for each conformer . for the mp2 correlation energies , an extrapolation scheme proposed by truhlar @xcite was applied : @xmath10 + again , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the cbs - extrapolated energy @xmath13 are parameters determined from a least - squares fitting algorithm as before .",
    "a detailed account of all numbers is given in the supporting material ( table s5 ) .",
    "mean absolute errors between the density - functional approximation ( dfa ) relative energies and the basis - set extrapolated mp2 relative energies were calculated as follows : @xmath14 + where the index @xmath15 runs over all @xmath16 conformations of a given data set . @xmath17 in principle",
    "denotes the energy difference between conformer @xmath15 and the lowest - energy conformer of the set .",
    "the adjustable parameter @xmath18 is used to shift the mp2 and dfa conformational hierarchies versus one another to obtain the lowest possible mae , rendering the reported mae value independent of the choice of any reference structure .",
    "figure  [ mp2bench]a shows the corresponding obtained mean absolute errors ( mae ) and maximal errors ( @xmath19 ) of different dfa calculations  performed with the fhi - aims code  with respect to benchmarks on the mp2 level obtained as described above . within fhi - aims , the accuracy of integration grids and of the electrostatic potential was also verified by comparing `` tight '' and `` really_tight '' numerical settings , giving virtually identical results .",
    "the dfa level of theory of pbe+vdw shows a mae well within _ chemical accuracy _ of @xmath20 for both structural sets of ala and phe ; for phe , the maximal error is @xmath21 .",
    "we next applied a different long - range dispersion treatment , a recent many - body dispersion model based on interacting quantum harmonic oscillators denoted as mbd,@xcite showing no significant improvement for the isolated amino acids . in line with ref .",
    "@xcite , applying the more expensive pbe0 @xcite hybrid exchange correlation functional reduces the maximum deviation for phe to @xmath22 , i.e. , 1.3kcal / mol . for ala and phe with neutral end caps in complex with a ca@xmath0 cation ,",
    "figure  [ mp2bench]b compares the same set of dfas to mp2 benchmark energy hierarchies .",
    "however , obtaining basis - set converged total energies of the same accuracy as for the isolated peptides by straightforward cbs extrapolation proved remarkably more difficult when ca@xmath0 was involved .",
    "the reason is traced to the significant and slow - converging correlation contribution of the ca@xmath0 semicore electrons , which leads to large and conformation dependent basis set superposition errors ( bsse ) .",
    "this problem was verified for mp2 calculations in the fhi - aims and orca codes , with several different basis set prescriptions @xcite , and for ccsd(t ) calculations .",
    "standard dfas , if sufficiently accurate , have a significant advantage in this respect since they are not subject to comparable numerical convergence problems .",
    "to yet arrive at reliable cbs - extrapolated mp2 conformational energy differences , we thus subjected the scf and correlation energies of each ca@xmath0 coordinated conformation to a counterpoise correction@xcite to minimize the effect of bsse on the ca@xmath0 correlation energy contribution , prior to performing cbs extrapolation as described above .",
    "for the example of ala+ca@xmath0 and assuming rigid conformers , the bsse is estimated as :    @xmath23    @xmath24 represents the energy of ala evaluated in the union of the basis sets on ala and ca@xmath0 , @xmath25 represents the energy of ala evaluated in the basis set on ala , _ etc .",
    "_ the individual bsse errors are then subtracted from the scf and correlation energy respectively .",
    "phe+ca@xmath0 is treated equivalently .",
    "complete numerical details are given in the supplementary material ( table s6 ) .",
    "following this procedure , the mae and maximal error values of various dfas compared to mp2 are well within 1kcal / mol for ala+ca@xmath0 .",
    "the pbe+vdw mae for phe+ca@xmath0 amounts to just above @xmath21 .",
    "the contributions from both the many - body dispersion and the hybrid pbe0 functional improve the mae to just above @xmath26 at to pbe0+mbd * level of theory .",
    "the maximum errors in the energy hierarchies between individual conformers are correspondingly larger .",
    "overall , this assessment shows that our data base of conformer geometries constitutes , e.g. , an excellent starting point for more exhaustive future benchmark work of new electronic structure methods for cation - peptide systems .",
    "for example , it would be very interesting to explore how f12 approaches , which address the correlation energy convergence problem explicitly , fare for a broad range of different ca@xmath0 containing conformations of our peptides . as a final validation",
    ", we compare the correlation of calculated gas - phase amino acid - ca@xmath0 binding energies to the binding energy hierarchy found experimentally in a study by ho _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "we calculate binding energy at the pes level as @xmath27 energies @xmath28 denote the pbe+vdw born - oppenheimer potential energies , including @xmath29 of the lowest - energy conformers of the isolated amino acid and @xmath30 of the same amino acid in complex with a ca@xmath0 ion .",
    "experimentally @xcite , the gas - phase ca@xmath0 affinities of 18 proteinogenic amino acids were determined by fragmenting ca@xmath0 complexes with a combinatoric library of tripeptides at @xmath31330  k , recording the mass spectrometric peak intensities of different fragmentation products .",
    "quantitative average relative binding energies of @xmath32 to different amino acids were thus inferred and can be compared to our findings , albeit with several important experiment - theory differences : ( i ) entropy effects @xcite should affect the specific complexes probed experimentally but can not be included into the calculated numbers in the exact same way , ( ii ) structural differences ( e.g. , protonation , dimerized amino acids ) between the fragments recorded in experiment and the amino acids covered here , ( iii ) experimental @xmath32 affinities are not given for asp and glu because their gas - phase acidities , needed for data conversion , are not known .",
    "figure  [ be_exp ] compares the experimentally and theoretically inferred @xmath32 binding affinities qualitatively .",
    "the @xmath33-axis reflects the experimental binding affinity energy hierarchy , arranging amino acids from left to right in order of decreasing binding affinity .",
    "the @xmath34 axis shows calculated binding energies according to eq .",
    "[ ebind ] . perfect correlation of the experimental and calculated hierarchies would imply a strictly monotonic decrease of calculated @xmath35 values from left to right .",
    "this monotonic trend is not obeyed exactly ; however , in view of the significant differences ( i ) and ( ii ) above , the qualitative agreement is quite striking .",
    "normalized correlation coefficients between the experimental ( 1 ) and calculated ( 2 ) binding affinity data were calculated following the formula : @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the covariance of data sets and @xmath38 being the standard deviations of data sets @xmath15=1,2 .",
    "the result , correlation coefficients of @xmath39=0.979 or 0.909 for uncapped amino acids or dipeptides , respectively , also point to an overall remarkably good agreement .",

    "<S> we present a structural data set of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids and their amino - methylated and acetylated ( capped ) dipeptides . different protonation states of the backbone ( uncharged and zwitterionic ) were considered for the amino acids as well as varied side chain protonation states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we studied amino acids and dipeptides in complex with divalent cations ( ca@xmath0 , ba@xmath0 , sr@xmath0 , cd@xmath0 , pb@xmath0 , and hg@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the database covers the conformational hierarchies of 280 systems in a wide relative energy range of up to 4ev ( 390kj / mol ) , summing up to an overall of 45,892 stationary points on the respective potential - energy surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> all systems were calculated on equal first - principles footing , applying density - functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation corrected for long - range van der waals interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we show good agreement to available experimental data for gas - phase ion affinities . </S>",
    "<S> our curated data can be utilized , for example , for a wide comparison across chemical space of the building blocks of life , for the parametrization of protein force fields , and for the calculation of reference spectra for biophysical applications .    </S>",
