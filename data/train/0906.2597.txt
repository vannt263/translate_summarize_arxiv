    "although the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) was discovered about 50 years ago first through its prompt @xmath1-ray emission , large uncertainties still remain in understanding the prompt emission site , namely , the distance of the emission site from the explosion centre @xmath0 , with controversial evidence .",
    "there are three possible sites discussed in the literature .",
    "one is the standard internal - shock site which depends on the fluctuation time scale @xmath7 seen in grb light curves ( e.g. , rees & mszros 1994 , see piran 2005 , mszros 2006 for reviews ) .",
    "it can have a large range of @xmath8 cm because @xmath7 and @xmath2 vary largely from burst to burst .",
    "the second is the photospheric radius at @xmath9 cm at which the prompt emission arises as a combination of the photosphere thermal emission and a comptonized component above it , the latter being induced by some energy dissipation process below and above the photosphere ( e.g. rees & mszros 2005 ; ryde et al .",
    "2006 ; thompson et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the third one is a large radius ( @xmath10 cm ) as is supported by the swift xrt data ( lazzati & begelman 2005 ; lyutikov 2006 ; kumar et al .",
    "2007 ) and fermi data of grb 080916c ( abdo et al . 2009 ; zhang & peer 2009 ) , possibly due to magnetic dissipation ( e.g. , lyutikov & blandford 2003 ) .    the rapidly responding ability of a few grb - dedicated ground or space based optical telescopes , e.g. , rotse ( akerlof et al . 2003 ) , raptor ( vestrand et al . 2002 ) , tortora ( racusin et al . 2008 ) and the uvot ( roming et al .",
    "2005 ) on aboard the swift satellite , has enabled the time - resolved detection of bright prompt optical emission before the @xmath1-rays die off , for about a dozen of grbs .",
    "five of these grbs , i.e. , 041219a ( vestrand et al . 2005 ) , 050820a ( vestrand et al .",
    "2006 ) , 051111 ( yost et al .",
    "2007a ) , 061121 ( page et al .",
    "2007 ) and 080319b ( racusin et al . 2008 ) , show a temporal correlation between the strongly variable optical flux and the @xmath1-ray pulses , which suggests that the optical emission most likely shares the same dynamical process that is responsible for the highly variable @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "while the other four bursts have optical flux densities below or marginally consistent with the extrapolations from the low - energy power law of the @xmath1-ray spectra , the optical flux density in grb 080319b exceeds the @xmath1-ray extrapolation by 4 orders of magnitude ( racusin et al .",
    "2008 ; kumar & panaitescu 2008 ) , suggesting that for this burst alone the optical emission has a spectral origin different from that of the @xmath1-rays .    in this paper , for the four grbs - 041219a , 050820a , 051111 and 061121 - we assume that the prompt optical and the @xmath1-ray emissions are components belonging to the same synchrotron radiation continuum of a group of hot electrons . based on this assumption ,",
    "the self - absorption frequency of the synchrotron electrons , @xmath11 , which causes a break in the long - wavelength part of the continuum , can be determined or constrained by studying the optical - to-@xmath1-ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to interpret the diversity in the prompt optical / @xmath1-ray temporal correspondence . ] . since @xmath11 is dependent on the properties of the prompt emission source , such as the distance of the emission site from the explosion centre @xmath0 , the bulk lorentz factor ( lf ) @xmath2 and the magnetic field @xmath3 of the source , from @xmath11 we can determine or make constraints on @xmath0 for these bursts , using information on @xmath2 and @xmath3 obtained in other ways .",
    "this is the main goal of this paper . since the prompt optical and @xmath1-ray components in grb 080319b are most likely of different spectral origins because of its peculiar sed shape , our approach is not applicable to this burst .",
    "on the other hand , for some other long grbs the rapid response of the dedicated rotse telescope has returned only upper limits of the optical flux density during the prompt phase ( yost et al .",
    "another goal of this paper is to get constraints on @xmath0 for these optically `` dark '' bursts and to study whether the prompt optical non - detection is caused by a heavier self - absorption due to a closer emission site to the explosion centre .    in this paper , we first derive analytically @xmath11 in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the emission properties in sec .",
    "the arguments that support our assumption of one synchrotron continuum component for both optical and @xmath1/x - ray are given in sec .",
    "we derive in sec .",
    "4 the constraints on @xmath0 through @xmath11 explicitly , by determining the location of @xmath11 in the optical - to-@xmath1-ray sed and considering all possible spectral regimes . we apply this method to a prompt optical detection grb sample and a prompt optical non - detection sample which are described in sec .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "6 . finally the conclusion and discussions are given in sec .",
    "the grb high energy emission spectrum is characterized by a smoothly joint broken - power - law form ( band et al . 1993 ) .",
    "thus the relativistic electrons responsible for the grb prompt emission due to either synchrotron or synchrotron self - inverse compton ( ssc ) radiation are in a piece - wise two - power - law energy distribution :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is such defined that @xmath14 is the number density of electrons with energy in the interval of @xmath1 to ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 is the minimum energy of these relativistic electrons ( for convenience we omit the factor @xmath17 in the electron energy @xmath18 throughout the text when electron energy is mentioned ) .",
    "note that although this distribution set - up is phenomenologically based on the two - power - law shape of the high energy radiation spectrum observed in grbs , it has specific physical meanings . within the shock acceleration scenario , newly accelerated electrons with a minimum energy @xmath19 and a power - law energy distribution",
    "are continuously injected .",
    "these electrons lose energy through radiative cooling , and the instantaneous electron spectrum steepens above a critical energy @xmath20 .",
    "all the electrons with energy larger than @xmath20 radiate away their energy within a time shorter than the dynamical time . when @xmath21 , our notation corresponds to @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 , the cooling causes a flatter power law between @xmath20 and @xmath19 , even though the newly accelerated electrons are injected in the energy range above @xmath19 . for this case one",
    "has @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in summary within the shock acceleration scenario one has @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "more generally , one can also have a scenario that invokes continuous heating and cooling of electrons ( e.g. that envisaged in the reconnection models ) , and @xmath29 then reflects the intrinsic break in the steady state electron spectrum . in any case , our treatment is generic , which does not depend on the concrete particle acceleration mechanism and the origin of @xmath29 .",
    "the broken power - law electron energy spectrum naturally gives rise to a piece - wise power law photon spectrum as commonly observed : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the observed flux density ( in units of mjy ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the observed characteristic emission frequencies of the electrons with energy @xmath16 and @xmath29 , respectively , and @xmath33 is usually the peak frequency of the @xmath34 spectrum .",
    "the low - energy power law @xmath35 does not extend to low frequency indefinitely . without synchrotron self absorption ,",
    "the spectral index below @xmath32 changes to 1/3 , regardless of whether @xmath21 or @xmath24 . below a certain frequency @xmath36 ,",
    "the synchrotron self absorption starts to play a significant role  at frequencies lower than @xmath11 the emitted photons are thermalized with the electrons .",
    "the self - absorption frequency @xmath11 is such defined that at this frequency the self - absorption optical depth @xmath37 .",
    "let us determine @xmath11 for an emitting grb ejecta moving with a lorentz factor ( lf ) @xmath2 at a distance @xmath0 from the center of the explosion . in the ejecta comoving frame",
    "( hereafter the quantities measured in this frame are marked with the prime sign ) , @xmath38 can be determined by equating the un - absorbed source surface flux density , @xmath39 , at @xmath38 to a blackbody surface flux density with temperature @xmath40 in the rayleigh - jeans regime ( see appendix for the derivation ; also see sari & piran 1999 , li & song 2004 , mcmahon , kumar & piran 2006 ) : @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the energy of electron whose characteristic emission frequency is @xmath38 , and @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant . the numerical factors @xmath46 and @xmath47 are functions of @xmath48 only whose values range from 1.2 to 4.5 and from 1.2 to 7.0 , respectively , for the range of observed @xmath48 values , but they have been neglected in previous works while we include them here .    transforming the frequency to that measured in the observer s frame gives @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the redshift of the grb host galaxy . measuring in the host comoving frame , the source has an isotropic luminosity of @xmath51 .",
    "this luminosity is also given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the luminosity distance of the grb and @xmath54 is the observed peak flux density .",
    "thus we have @xmath55 $ ] . after applying these relations ,",
    "( 3 ) becomes @xmath56    after substituting the electron s energy @xmath1 using the following relation between @xmath1 and the photon frequency @xmath57 , @xmath58 the self - absorption frequency is calculated as : for synchrotron @xmath59 @xmath60 and , for ssc @xmath59 @xmath61 in the results above , the flux density , e.g. , @xmath54 , is in units of mjy , @xmath62 and the convention @xmath63 , e.g. , @xmath64 hz and @xmath65 gauss , is used for other quantities ; the same notations will be used in the rest of the paper . in the following",
    ", our discussion will be based on the synchrotron radiation only .",
    "but for the use of reference the expression of @xmath11 for ssc is also given here .",
    "in this paper , we make an assumption that for the two samples ( see sec .",
    "5 for a description of the sample selection criteria ) studied , the optical and @xmath1/x - ray photons belong to a same synchrotron continuum spectrum generated by a same group of hot electrons .",
    "this assumption is based on the following three considerations .",
    "first , grb prompt @xmath1/x - ray emission is often interpreted as synchrotron radiation of a group of non - thermal electrons .",
    "if that is the case , the synchrotron spectrum _ must _ have a continuum extending to the low - frequency regime up to the optical band , presumably with a gentle slope of @xmath66 unless it has a self - absorption break .",
    "secondly , the optical flux density is expected to always lie below or near the extrapolation from the @xmath1-ray spectrum .",
    "this is generally consistent with observations in our sample ( see sec .",
    "5 below and fig .",
    "2 ) . finally",
    ", a temporal correlation between the optical flux variation and the @xmath1-ray lc is observed for the 4 grbs in the our sample , suggesting the two components likely have the same dynamical origin .",
    "this is the major supporting evidence for our assumption .",
    "we notice that there are other scenarios on prompt @xmath1/optical emission that have been discussed in the literature .",
    "these include the synchrotron + ssc model ( kumar & panaitescu 2008 ; racusin et al .",
    "2008 ) , the models invoke different emission radii for optical and @xmath1-ray emissions ( li & waxman 2008 ; fan , zhang & wei 2009 ) , and the model invokes two shock regions at a same emission radius ( yu , wang & dai 2009 ) .",
    "these models are relevant to grb 080319b , which clearly requires a separate spectral component to interpret the prompt optical emission . for most other bursts studied in this paper ,",
    "although these models are not ruled out , they are not demanded by the data .",
    "our simple one - component model is adequate to interpret these bursts , and we will hereafter adopt this one - component assumption .",
    "let us consider the synchrotron emission as the prompt emission mechanism . depending on the locations of @xmath32 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the ratio of the optical flux density to the flux density at @xmath33 is given for four different spectral cases by @xmath67 @xmath68    fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_case ] illustrates these four spectral cases .",
    "there is also a variation of case ( iii ) ( let us call it case iii.5 ) : @xmath69 , for which the flux density ratio is @xmath70 .",
    "we will come back to this case later and show that it is almost exactly the same as case ( iii ) .",
    "in some grbs simultaneous observations of prompt x - ray and @xmath1-ray emissions are made .",
    "the x - ray spectrum corrected for the photo - absorption in the soft end always nicely matches the power law extrapolated from @xmath1-ray spectrum below @xmath33 , without a need to invoke a break ( e.g. cenko et al .",
    "2006 ; romano et al .",
    "2006 ; page et al .",
    "this requires that both @xmath11 and @xmath32 be smaller than @xmath71 0.3 kev , the lower end of the swift xrt band pass .",
    "we take this as a constraint in our analyses .",
    "we aim to constrain @xmath0 based on the spectral information , such as @xmath54 , @xmath72 and @xmath48 , using @xmath11 as a proxy . we know from sec .",
    "2 that @xmath11 is expressed in terms of @xmath54 , @xmath32 and @xmath0 .",
    "so for each spectral case , we substitute the appropriate @xmath11 expression into the flux density ratio equation or into the constraint on @xmath11 implied by the definition of that spectral case ( eq .",
    "8) , and then get the @xmath0 constraints .    for case ( i )",
    ", substituting @xmath11 and letting @xmath73 hz ( for r band ) , we have @xmath74 there is also a justification criterion due to the case definition @xmath75 , where @xmath11 is directly determined from the flux density ratio in eq .",
    "( 8) by @xmath76    for case ( ii ) , the flux density ratio does not depend on @xmath11 and hence on @xmath0 .",
    "one justification criterion for this case is that the spectral slope from the optical to the x- or @xmath1-rays has to be consistent with @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "another criterion due to the case definition is @xmath78 .",
    "substituting with the expression of @xmath11 , the latter gives @xmath79 @xmath80    for case ( iii ) , when substituting the appropriate @xmath11 expression in eq .",
    "( 6 ) into the flux density ratio relation , it gives the expression of @xmath0 in @xmath81 we find for case ( iii.5 ) that the @xmath0 expression  obtained by substituting the appropriate @xmath11 expression into eq.(8 )  is exactly the same as eq .",
    "( 12 ) except that @xmath46 is replaced with @xmath47 .",
    "we find the ratio @xmath82 lies in the range of ( 1 , 1.6 ) for @xmath83 ( see in appendix ) .",
    "according to the definition of case ( iii ) , @xmath84 . plugging this constraint of @xmath32 into eq .",
    "( 12 ) and its counterpart equation for case ( iii.5 ) , it gives @xmath85 @xmath86 note that in writing this constraint we already combined the one for case ( iii ) with the one for case ( iii.5 ) .",
    "it is done by using @xmath46 in the lower limit and @xmath47 in the upper limit , such that the combined constraint is conservative . from now on we expand the case ( iii ) definition to be @xmath87 so that it includes case ( iii.5 ) .",
    "two last pieces of constraining information for case ( iii ) are from @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90 , where we use the expressions for @xmath11 given in eq .",

    "the second constraint gives @xmath95 @xmath96^{\\frac{1}{2/3 - 2\\b_1 } } f_{\\nu_{opt}}^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\frac{d_{l,28}}{(1+z)}.\\ ] ] here the constraint @xmath75 gives a lower limit of @xmath0 , contrary to what is inferred from the conventional relation between @xmath11 and @xmath0 .",

    "this is because the @xmath11 expression in both cases contains @xmath0 and @xmath32 , but in case ( iii ) @xmath32 is a strong function of @xmath0 , @xmath100 , while in case ( iv ) @xmath32 is a function of the flux density ratio only .",
    "thus in case ( iii ) the @xmath0-dependence is reversed between two sides of the inequality relation @xmath75 .    to summarize , the overall constraints on @xmath0 are : eq .",
    "( 9 ) for case ( i ) , eq . ( 11 ) for case ( ii ) , eq .",
    "( 13 - 15 ) for case ( iii ) and eq .",
    "( 17 ) for case ( iv ) .",
    "in addition , when they are available , the calculated @xmath11 or @xmath32 must satisfy the case definitions .",
    "if the optical flux density has only an upper limit , the above @xmath0-constraints must be taken with a conservative point of view wherever @xmath72 is involved .",
    "let @xmath72 represent the measured upper limit . for case ( i ) , eq .",
    "( 9 ) will give an upper limit for @xmath0 .",
    "for case ( ii ) , eq .",

    "( 16 ) gives a lower limit of @xmath32 which can be used to justify the case definition ; eq .",

    "( 17 ) is obtained by substituting the @xmath32 expression into the definition constraint @xmath98 . here , instead of using the @xmath32 expression",
    ", we plug in the upper boundary of @xmath32 : @xmath101 , then a new lower limit of @xmath0 is obtained for case ( iv ) : @xmath102 @xmath103",
    "now we turn to the real grb data to which our method developed above can be applied .",
    "first we construct a small sample of grbs whose prompt optical emission is not only detected but is also variable and temporally correlated with the @xmath1-rays . excluding grb 080319b that requires a new spectral component for optical emission , we identify four of grbs in the sample , all belonging to the long - duration class .",
    "three of them show complex fluctuations in their prompt @xmath1-ray and optical lcs while the fourth is a single , smoothly peaked event , so we utilize multiple time intervals for each of the three .",
    "the emission properties of each time interval are listed in tab . 1 .",
    "grb 041219a is a very long ( @xmath104 500 s ) burst and has multiple peaks in @xmath1-ray lc .",
    "it has three optical detection intervals ; the first two are correlated with the first @xmath1-ray peak and the third with the second @xmath1-ray peak ( vestrand et al . 2005 ) .",
    "grb 050820a is a similar one except that it has denser optical temporal coverage .",
    "its optical lc is decomposed into two components : a smooth component with fast rise and power - law decay , and a strongly variable component superposed on it ( vestrand et al .",
    "the smooth component is well accounted for by the early afterglow due to the grb outflow interacting with the ambient medium .",
    "the variable component is found to correlate with the @xmath1-ray peaks , suggesting it has the same origin as the @xmath1-rays . in tab .",
    "1 the optical emission properties for this burst are for the residual optical component after subtracting the smooth component .",
    "grb 051111 has a single fred ( fast rise and exponential decay ) peak in @xmath1-rays lasting @xmath105 90 s. the first optical observation starts at 30 s after the burst trigger when the @xmath1-ray lc began to decay ( yost et al .",
    "the prompt optical lc ( before the @xmath1-rays die off ) decays more steeply than that of the later optical afterglow emission .",
    "the prompt optical emission has an excess above the back extrapolation of the later optical afterglow component .",
    "it has a decay slope statistically compatible with that of the @xmath1-ray lc , and its flux density is also compatible with the spectral extrapolation of the @xmath1-rays ( yost et al .",
    "this is good evidence that the prompt optical excess has the same origin as the @xmath1-rays .",

    "the break(s ) could be @xmath11 , @xmath32 , or both .",

    ", we use the interval which has the smallest measurement error in the @xmath1-ray flux density @xmath54 - usually the interval that has the brightest @xmath1-ray flux .",
    "the only exception is grb 061222a , for which three time intervals are used .",

    "they all have small errors in @xmath54 , and the instantaneous @xmath1-ray spectral index @xmath48 are available for all three intervals .",
    "the motivation of selecting this sample is the following : even if there is no direct detection of prompt optical emission , one can speculate the existence of a prompt optical emission component that tracking the @xmath1-ray lcs , which is the spectral extension of the prompt @xmath1-ray spectrum into the optical band .",
    "the flux level of this component must be fainter than the upper limit set by the rotse observations .",
    "we want to check whether inferred @xmath0 constraints of this sample is consistent with the sample with optical detection , and whether the non - detection of optical emission of this sample is due to stronger synchrotron self absorption associated with a smaller @xmath0 .",

    "in addition , here we present some attempts to estimate @xmath2 for each grb in our first sample ( with optical detections ) using three independent arguments , which suggests that the choice of @xmath117 is reasonable .",
    "\\(1 ) the variability time scale argument . for the standard scenario",
    "in which the variability time scale is that of the central engine and that the ejecta form a conical jet with opening angle much larger than @xmath118 , the observed variability time scale should be at least the angular spreading time .",
    "this gives the constraint @xmath119^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the observed variability time scale , defined as the rising or decaying time scale of the pulses in the lc .",
    "from the data we find that @xmath120 is @xmath121 1 - 15 s for our sample .",
    "the @xmath2-constraint from this argument is rather weak compared with the other two constraints described below .",
    "\\(2 ) the photon annihilation opacity argument .",
    "a grb releases a huge amount of energy ( @xmath122 erg isotropically ) in terms of high energy photons from a small volume , which are subject to the photon - photon annihilation ( e.g. baring & harding 1997 ; lithwick & sari 2001 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath123 is the maximum photon energy detected in the burst , the fact that a single power - law or a piece - wise power - law spectrum is detected for most grbs up to @xmath123 implies that the optical depth of photon - photon pair production @xmath124 for the photons of energy @xmath123 is smaller than unity .",
    "@xmath124 is related to the total number of photons and the size of the emission region , the latter of which can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath120 within the internal shock model .",
    "thus this requirement can impose a lower limit on @xmath2 within the internal shock model .",
    "more generally the opacity argument can give a constraint in the @xmath125 space ( gupta & zhang 2008 ; murase & ioka 2008 ; zhang & peer 2009 ) .",
    "our following treatment applies to the internal shock model that is commonly discussed in the literature .",
    "the minimum photon energy at which the photons are able to annihilate with photons of energy @xmath123 is : @xmath126 the power - law form spectrum just below @xmath123 is described as in @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the detected photon energy , @xmath129 - in units of @xmath130s@xmath131@xmath132mev@xmath133 $ ] - is the number of photons detected per unit time per unit area per unit energy at @xmath128 , @xmath134 is equal to @xmath129 at @xmath135 mev , and @xmath136 is the photon index .",
    "we followed the formulae of lithwick & sari ( 2001 ) in their limit a case to calculate the lower limit of @xmath2 due to @xmath137 for our optical detection sample .",
    "the results , as well as the observational properties that are used , are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : opa ] .",
    "note that for all bursts in the sample , @xmath138 for reasonable values of @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xmath139 ) . thus our calculation has implicitly assumed that the power - law form spectrum detected below @xmath123",
    "would actually extend well beyond @xmath123 and up to @xmath140 , which is usually below the detector s limited bandpass .",
    "more rigorous calculations require the knowledge of the spectral shape below peak energy of the spectrum ( gupta & zhang 2008 ) . however , the optical depth is much more sensitive to @xmath141 than the spectral indices , and the derived @xmath2 constraint is not significantly modified by performing the more rigorous treatment .",
    "the above treatment is adequate to serve our purpose .",
    "\\(3 ) the deceleration time constraint . in the well established external shock model for grb afterglows ( e.g. , mszros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; chevalier & li 2000 ;",
    "see piran 2005 for a review ) , the onset of afterglow marks the time , as known as the deceleration time @xmath142 , when one half of the total kinetic energy of the grb outflow @xmath143 is deposited to the shocked circumburst medium .",
    "the afterglow light curve should rise before @xmath142 and decay in a power law with time after @xmath142 ( e.g. , molinari et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the deceleration time @xmath142 is determined by @xmath143 , outflow bulk lf @xmath2 and the density of the circumburst medium , either a constant density medium ( ism ) or a wind - like medium [ @xmath144 : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the proton number density of the ism medium , and @xmath147 g cm@xmath131 is the wind medium density normalization parameter .",
    "the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy @xmath149 can be related to the isotropic energy release in @xmath1-ray radiation @xmath150 by an energy conversion efficiency factor @xmath151 .",
    "the afterglow observations ( x - rays and optical ) for our sample show either a power law decay starting from the earliest observation interval or , a long - lasting shallow decay followed by a normal power law decay .",
    "it suggests that the afterglow onsets should be earlier than the start of the single power law decay or the start of the shallow decay .",
    "one can use the first observation data in the decaying afterglow phase to constraint the deceleration time to be earlier than the observational epoch ( e.g. , zhang et al . 2006 ) . from the data",
    ", we find the deceleration time @xmath152 s for grb 041219a , and @xmath153 100 - 500 s for the other 3 grbs ( 050820a , 051111 , 061121 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath154 , @xmath155 @xmath156 and @xmath157 , we find : for ism , @xmath158 for 041219a , @xmath159 for the other 3 grbs ; for wind , @xmath160 for 041219a , @xmath161 for the other 3 .",
    "the results are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : dec ] .",
    "we have checked of the compliance with closure relationships predicted by the external shock models for these bursts during the afterglow phase .",
    "it turns out that two ( grb 050820a and 061121 ) out of the 4 grbs are consistent with and in favour of the ism environment scenario , while the other two are consistent with both scenarios and can not discriminate between them .    to summarize , with the available data , one can only constrain but can not determine @xmath2 of the grbs in our sample . on the other hand ,",
    "all three constraints derived from the data are consistent with @xmath162 adopted in our calculations . in particular , the @xmath2-constraint derived from the argument ( 3 ) , which is the most stringent one among the three arguments , indicate that the assumed value of @xmath162 is reasonable .      the @xmath3 value in the emission region is a function of @xmath0 .",
    "there are two possible origins of the magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "the first component is the global magnetic field entrained by the ejecta from the central engine .",
    "let s assume @xmath163 g at the central engine , a typical value for a fast rotating magnetar or a fast rotating black hole accretion disk system - the two most plausible grb central engine candidates .",
    "the @xmath3 value drops as @xmath164 with @xmath0 up to the light cylinder , and then drops as @xmath165 thereafter ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) .",
    "given that the central rotating source has a radius of @xmath166 cm and a rotation period of @xmath167 ms , at a radius @xmath168 cm , the field that is carried within the outflow has a strength of @xmath169 g.    the second @xmath3 component is a random field generated _ in - situ _ in the emission region , likely in a relativistic shock via the weibel instability ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "this random field also follows the same @xmath0-dependence and is of the same order as the engine - related @xmath3 component if @xmath170 - the ratio of the post - shock magnetic energy density to the total energy density - is not too small ( zhang & mszros 2002 ) .",
    "one can also briefly estimate the local field strength by relating the grb @xmath1-ray peak photon energy , typically @xmath171 mev , with the synchrotron characteristic frequency , @xmath172 , where @xmath1 is the typical energy of electrons . in the internal - shock model , @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the ratio of the electron energy density over the total thermal energy density in the post - shock fluid ,",
    "@xmath175 and @xmath176 is the electron energy spectral index .",
    "the parameter @xmath177 is the fractional energy gain of a proton passing the shock which depends only on the relative lf between the fluids downstream and upstream . for internal shocks",
    ", @xmath177 is _ not _ dependent on the shell bulk lf @xmath2 and is of the order of unity . for @xmath178 and @xmath179",
    ", we have @xmath180 .",
    "thus the required @xmath3 value can be estimated as @xmath181 g.    the three crude estimates are marginally consistent with each other .",
    "we have taken @xmath182 g as the typical value throughout the text .",
    "of course a large uncertainty exists due to our lack of understanding on the field properties , but it is reconciled by the very weak dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 ( 1/4 power ) .",
    "kumar & mcmahon ( 2008 ) developed a general method of modelling grb s @xmath1-ray emission properties .",
    "their method considers the synchrotron and the ssc emission , respectively , as the radiation mechanism , takes into account the radiative cooling of electrons , and uses observed emission properties ( such as the peak flux density and the pulse duration ) to search for the allowed space of the model parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "here we also apply their method for the synchrotron case to our optical detection sample using their code , and compare the results with ours . we add a new constraint into the module that controls the allowed model parameter space , which is that the optical flux density calculated from the model has to match the observed one within a @xmath183% range .",
    "to use this detailed modelling method , we have to specify which standard synchrotron spectral regime a grb emission interval is in . the spectral indices ( @xmath48 ) of the optical detection sample in tab .",
    "1 have a variety of values around -1/2 , based on which we classify the sample into 4 categories and apply the detailed modelling method accordingly .",
    "( 1 ) for those time intervals that are most probably consistent with the @xmath184 regime ( 051111 and 061121 int .",
    "1 ) , this method gives @xmath185 cm .",
    "( 2 ) for those possibly consistent with both @xmath184 and @xmath186 where @xmath187 ( 041219a int . 3 and 050820a int .",
    "3 ) , the method in the @xmath184 regime gives @xmath5 cm , while in the @xmath186 regime it gives no allowed @xmath0-space  but if we relax the @xmath72 constraint , it gives @xmath188 cm .",
    "( 3 ) for those possibly consistent with both @xmath184 and @xmath186 where @xmath189 ( 041219a int .",
    "2 , 050820a int . 1 and 2 ) , the method in the @xmath184 regime gives @xmath5 cm ; however , the code provided by the authors is not applicable when @xmath190 .",
    "( 4 ) the last category are those inconsistent with @xmath184 but probably consistent with @xmath186 if @xmath189 ( 041219a int . 1 and 061121 int .",
    "2 ) for which the code is not applicable .    overall , we find that for the major part of the optical detection sample where the detailed modelling method ( kumar & mcmahon 2008 ) is applicable the allowed spaces for @xmath0 from this method are about @xmath191 cm .",
    "this is approximately consistent with the findings from our approach that @xmath0 is @xmath192 ( a few @xmath193 cm for most of the intervals in the sample , and @xmath194 cm for the remaining two intervals in the sample .",
    "based on the assumption that the prompt optical and @xmath1-ray emissions belong to the same synchrotron continuum of a group of hot electrons , we make constraints on the location of the prompt emission site for a sample of grbs whose prompt optical emission is detected to temporally tracking the @xmath1-ray lcs , by determining the location of @xmath11 in their sed .",
    "our analysis shows that for most of the intervals in this sample the distance of the prompt emission site from the explosion centre @xmath0 is @xmath192 ( a few @xmath195 cm , and for the remaining two intervals , the emission site is @xmath196 cm away from the explosion centre .",
    "the dependence of the distance constraint on the grb outflow lf @xmath2 is not negligible . on the other hand , various indirect observational constraints on @xmath2 point to @xmath197 ( e.g. molinari et al . 2007 ; and even @xmath198 for grb 080916c , abdo et al . 2009 ) . the derived observational constraints on @xmath2 for bursts of this sample ( sec .",
    "[ sec : gam - b ] ) are consistent with such an inference . in our paper , we take @xmath162 as a typical value .",
    "a higher @xmath2 would only make the above distance constraint even larger .",
    "our knowledge of the local magnetic field strength @xmath3 is less certain , although the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath3 is weak .",
    "several crude estimates of @xmath3 based on the synchrotron radiation mechanism for grb prompt emission suggest @xmath199 g at @xmath200 cm . this typical value has been adopted in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath0-constraint we obtained is inconsistent with the photospheric emission model in which the prompt emission arises at the photosphere radius of @xmath201 cm ( rees & mszros 2005 ; ryde et al . 2006 ; thompson et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this result alone can not discriminate between the fireball internal shock model and the magnetic outflow model . by comprehensive modeling the grb prompt @xmath1-rays and early x - rays , kumar et al .",
    "( 2007 ) concluded a prompt emission site of @xmath202 cm , which is supported by their further general modeling of the @xmath1-ray emission properties ( kumar & mcmahon 2008 ) .",
    "a large @xmath0 is derived for grb 080916c through the pair opacity constraint ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 ; zhang & peer 2009 ) , the inference of @xmath0 in abdo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is based specifically on the internal shock model while zhang & peer ( 2009 ) gave a more model - independent constraint on @xmath0 . ] and for grb 080319b through the synchrotron self - absorption constraint ( racusin et al .",
    "2008 ) and the ssc scattering optical depth constraint ( kumar & panaitescu 2008 ) . in summary ,",
    "a large prompt emission distance from the central engine seems to be supported by three independent approaches , respectively , i.e. in @xmath1/x - rays ( e.g. , lazzati & begelman 2005 ; lyutikov 2006 ; kumar et al .",
    "2007 ) , in gev @xmath1-rays ( abdo et al . 2009",
    "; zhang & peer 2009 ) , and in the optical band ( this paper ) .",
    "we have also studied a sample of grbs with prompt optical non - detections . applying the same technique ,",
    "we do _ not _ find any inconsistency between their @xmath0 constraints and those of the optical detection sample .",
    "this result is inherited from the findings by yost et al .",
    "( 2007b ) that no distinction in distributions of @xmath48 and @xmath203 can be drawn between the optically dark grbs and the grbs with optical detections .",
    "however , this is only because the currently limited instrumental sensitivity prevents a distinction from being drawn .",
    "deeper observations in the future in the optical band would provide further information regarding whether the optical deficit is due to a heavier synchrotron self - absorption in these bursts .",
    "if multi - color photometry near the optical band exists for the same time interval during the prompt phase , it would provide the local spectral index near the optical band ( provided that the extinction correction is properly made ) .",
    "this would be helpful to identify the spectral case the data satisfy .",
    "for example , the spectral indices near optical differ by @xmath204 between the cases ( iii ) and ( iv ) , and by @xmath205 between the cases ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "unfortunately , this kind of observational information is unavailable for all the time intervals of the optical detection sample we have considered in tab .",
    "the hope is that future multi - band prompt optical detections may be able to break the spectral case degeneracy and to tighten the @xmath0-constraint .",
    "our method is based on the assumption that the optical emission is emitted from the same group of electrons that produce the @xmath1-rays in the same site via the same synchrotron radiation .",
    "this _ one component _",
    "assumption has some supports ( see sec . 3 ) but certainly is not conclusive .",
    "there are three other scenarios that have been discussed in the literature ( mostly motivated by interpreting grb 080319b ) .",
    "the first one invokes two emission zones for optical and @xmath1-rays .",
    "for example , in the internal - shock - model based residual collision scenario proposed by li & waxman ( 2008 ) , the shells with high lf contrast in a grb outflow collide first and merge at smaller radii , producing the @xmath1/x - rays . later those merged shells with low lf contrasts would collide mildly at later times and larger radii , giving rise to optical emission .",
    "alternatively , if the outflow is neutron rich , the proton shells tend to collide at smaller radii to power @xmath1/x - rays , while the free neutrons only decay at large radii and the decay products would be collided by later injected faster proton shells and power optical emission at larger radii ( fan et al .",
    "2009 ) . in both scenarios",
    ", it is expected that the observed optical pulse peak emission time is delayed by @xmath206 with respect to the @xmath1-ray pulse peak emission time , which may be in principle tested if the data quality is high .",
    "these models however do not naturally predict a smooth extension of @xmath1-ray spectrum to the optical band without distinct spectral features .",
    "although they can not be ruled out by the data in our sample , they are more complicated than our one - zone model .    secondly , our analysis is not applicable in the following scenario ( yu et al .",
    "2009 ) : a pair of shocks ( reverse shock and forward shock ) arise when two shells collide in the internal - shock model ; different populations of electrons are accelerated in each of the two shocks and the two populations have different typical electron energies and different shock - generated magnetic strengths .",
    "the characteristic synchrotron frequencies are different - the forward shock produces the optical emission , while the reverse shock produces the @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "these two emissions are two spectrally independent components but are temporally correlated because the heating of the two electron populations arises from the same dynamical process .",
    "although this model may interpret the peculiar sed shape of grb 080319b whose prompt optical flux density exceeds the extrapolation from the @xmath1-ray spectrum by 4 orders of magnitude , it is unclear whether it can work properly for the bursts in our optical detection sample .    finally , the synchrotron + ssc scenario ( kumar & panaitescu 2008 ; racusin et al .",
    "2008 ) has been proposed to interpret grb 080319b . for our sample",
    ", there is no need to introduce a second distinct spectral component .",
    "we consider only pure synchrotron radiation in deriving constraints on @xmath0 , although we have given the @xmath11 estimation for ssc radiation whose value is similar to @xmath11 for synchrotron . in principle",
    ", it is possible that the observed emission from optical to @xmath1-rays is dominated by ssc .",
    "if this is the case , our approach of constraining @xmath0 by calculating @xmath11 may give results somewhat different from the synchrotron case for the same sample of bursts .",
    "we did not carry out the analysis for the ssc case because the detailed shape of the ssc spectra is much more complicated than the synchrotron one .",
    "note that our approach assumes that the optical and the @xmath1-rays are from the same group of electrons due to the same radiation mechanism . in the ssc scenario",
    "this approach is applicable only if the ssc component dominates a large spectral band from the @xmath1-ray down to the optical and the synchrotron component has to lie well below the optical band .",
    "this is usually not expected in the ssc models ( e.g. piran , sari & zou 2009 ) . in any case , if ssc is involved in interpreting any part of the spectrum in our sample , then our analysis is no longer applicable .",

    "the synchrotron radiation spectrum , or specific radiation power , of an electron with lf @xmath1 gyrating in a magnetic field @xmath3 with a pitch angle @xmath136 is @xmath215 where @xmath128 is the electron charge and @xmath216 is the characteristic photon frequency of the electron .",
    "the function @xmath217 has the asymptotic form @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the gamma function of argument 1/3 , and it reaches the maximum @xmath220 at @xmath221 . one integral property of the function @xmath222 is @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the gamma function of argument @xmath225 .",
    "we will use this property later .",
    "the self - absorption coefficient for any radiation mechanism is given ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) by @xmath226},\\ ] ] where @xmath227 is the single electron s specific radiation power , and @xmath14 is the number density of electrons with energy in the interval from @xmath1 to ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in the case of grb , @xmath13 has a two - power - law form and was described in sec . 2 of the paper .",
    "we rewrite it here as @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the normalization constant .",
    "note that this distribution set - up is phenomenologically based on the two - power - law shape of the high energy radiation spectrum observed in grbs ; in the context of some specific particle acceleration scenario , e.g. , shock acceleration , where two characteristic electron energies , i.e. , the injection energy @xmath19 and the cooling energy @xmath20 , are involved , there will be @xmath27 and @xmath230 .",

    "if @xmath237 , then @xmath222 falls in the @xmath239 asymptotic regime .",
    "one can transform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ al_fx ] ) for the variable @xmath1 into the integral for the variable @xmath240 .",
    "notice the contribution from the second integral part in eq .",
    "( [ al_fx ] ) is unimportant , as long as @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "thus it gives @xmath243    if @xmath238 , then @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "after the transformation of the variable @xmath1 into the variable @xmath240 , the first integral part in eq .",
    "( [ al_fx ] ) is in effect integrating over the @xmath240-range from @xmath246 to @xmath247 , thus we can use eq .",
    "( [ int_fx ] ) to calculate it . for the second integral part of eq .",
    "( [ al_fx ] ) , @xmath248 , but its contribution is unimportant as long as @xmath241 and @xmath242",
    ". therefore it gives @xmath249    to calculate @xmath38 from @xmath250 , one has to know the exact information about @xmath251 and its instantaneous distribution over the width of the emitting source along the line of sight , which are always subject to uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , in their attempts to calculate @xmath38 , some authors have calculated @xmath251 by assuming all electrons swept up by the shock are accelerated to relativistic energies either in the blastwave model for grb afterglows ( granot , piran & sari 1999 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; peer & waxman 2004 ) or in the internal - shock model for prompt emissions ( li & waxman 2008 ) .",
    "we warn that the reality in nature may be that _ not all _ but only a small fraction of the electrons encountered by the shock can be heated to relativistic energies and radiate , as was suggested by bykov & mszros ( 1996 ) and daigne & mochkovitch ( 1998 ) ( also see kumar & mcmahon ( 2008 ) for an idea of repeated acceleration of a group of electrons ) , and this will introduce the biggest uncertainty to @xmath251 hence to this `` conventional '' approach of calculating @xmath38 . in general , this conventional approach over - estimates the number of emitting ( and absorbing ) electrons and , hence , over - estimates @xmath11 . in the literature , it is usually suggested that @xmath11 is slightly below the x - ray band . according to our corrected calculation ,",
    "@xmath11 is typically lower and can extend to close to the optical band in a wide parameter range .",
    "our new approach here is to express @xmath252 in terms of @xmath253 , both of which contain the term @xmath254 but the latter one is directly observable - it is just the specific intensity at the source surface .",
    "therefore the new approach can avoid the uncertainties associated with partial acceleration and inhomogeneity over the source radial width .",
    "the ratio of @xmath214 over @xmath211 , also called the source function , is @xmath257 which does not have dependence on @xmath251 .",
    "it shows that , for synchrotron radiation , the power - law index of the optical thick ( to the self absorption ) part of the emergent spectrum below @xmath258 is 2 , while the power - law index of the optical thick spectrum above @xmath258 is 5/2 .    from the definition of the self - absorption frequency @xmath259",
    ", we have @xmath260 .",
    "since @xmath261 does not depend on @xmath251 and its distribution over the source width , it can be taken out of the integral .",
    "thus we have @xmath262 , where @xmath39 is the specific flux at the source surface in the asymptotic optically thin regime at @xmath38 . rewriting the expression for @xmath263 ( eq . [ source_func ] ) at @xmath264 and using the photon frequency vs. electron energy relation @xmath265 for synchrotron radiation",
    ", we get @xmath266 where @xmath44 is the energy of the electron whose characteristic photon frequency is @xmath38 , and the correction factor @xmath267    if we assume a temperature @xmath268 then the last equation is @xmath269 where for practical uses the correction factor @xmath270 is changed to @xmath271 using the relation @xmath272 , and so @xmath273 in the samples presented in the main body of the paper , @xmath48 is among -1.4 to 0 , so the ranges for the correction factor are @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "therefore eq . ( [ kt_f ] ) shows that , within a factor of a few , at @xmath38 the un - absorbed source surface flux density is equal to the flux density of the rayleigh - jeans part of the blackbody spectrum with a temperature corresponding to the lowest energy of those electrons that are barely affected by the self absorption .",
    "this equation is used to calculate @xmath38 in the main body of the paper where the correction factor @xmath271 is taken into account ."
