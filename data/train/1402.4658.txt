    "we obtain tilings with symmetry group @xmath48 ( translations only , see figure [ pict : only - transl ] ) .    in order to see that these examples do actually have the claimed symmetry groups , it is instructive to consider how certain isometries act on the symbolic sequence @xmath38 . here",

    "it remains to rule out tilings with symmetry groups @xmath27 in the cases considered here , i.e. , in the six families of tilings that may have non - crystallographic symmetry groups .",
    "since these tilings consist of the layers discussed above , any possible reflection mapping the tiling to itself has to map the layers to themselves .",
    "thus its mirror axis is either parallel to the layers , or orthogonal to the layers .",
    "a reflection orthogonal to the layers maps a layer @xmath53 to a layer @xmath76 , resp .",

    "in the first case , the reflection would switch a symmetric layer ( @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) with a non - symmetric layer ( @xmath51 or @xmath11 ) , hence it is not a symmetry of the tiling . in the second case",

    "hence the axis of any glide reflection is parallel to the layers . by the same reasoning as above",
    ", it must be the central axis of a layer @xmath50 consisting of rectangles .",
    "it remains to show that there is no `` original '' such glide reflection , in terms of group generators .",
    "i.e. , we have to show that any such glide reflection is a combination of a reflection @xmath79 and a translation @xmath80 that are already symmetries of the tiling .",

    "thus its length is an integer multiple of the length of one edge of the rectangles in layer @xmath50 . but",
    "a translation by just one edge length of the rectangles already maps the tiling to itself .",
    "thus for any possible glide reflection @xmath81 which translational part shifts by @xmath0 rectangles , there is a translation @xmath80  shifting by @xmath82 rectangles  such that @xmath83 is a proper reflection that maps the tiling to itself .",
    "hence a group @xmath27 can not occur as symmetry group of a monocoronal tiling .",
    "now we will establish all possible symmetry groups of 1-periodic monocoronal tilings .",
    "first we will give examples as sequences of layers of rectangles and parallelograms as before ( sequences of 0 s and 1 s ) .",

    "for the group @xmath85 we can use the sequence @xmath86 which is infinity with 0 s in one direction and 1 s in the other . and for the group @xmath31 we can use the sequence @xmath87 with only one 1 .    the group @xmath88 can occur as a symmetry group of tiling with layers of isosceles triangles and parallelograms with sequence @xmath86 which is infinity with 0 s in one direction and 1 s in the other . here the axis of the glide reflection is in the middle line of layers of triangles between 0 and 1 .",
    "all other three frieze groups @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 can not be realized as symmetry group of @xmath92-periodic monocoronal tiling because they contain a mirror symmetry in the direction orthogonal to layers which is impossible for both types of non - symmetric layers .",
    "in the last section we have seen that monocoronal tilings up to rigid motions are always 2-periodic , whereas monocoronal tilings in general are either 1-periodic or 2-periodic .",
    "thus one may ask for the possible dimensions of the translation group of a monocoronal tiling in higher dimension @xmath93 .",
    "trivially , the maximal dimension is always @xmath16 , realised for instance by the canonical face - to - face tiling of @xmath8 by unit hypercubes .",

    "this latter layer is 1-periodic , but in a direction orthogonal to the period of the first layer .",
    "hence the union of all three layers is non - periodic .        proceeding in this manner yields a tiling of @xmath107 such that even layers consist of unit cubes , odd layers consist of unit cubes and triangular prisms .",
    "it is clear that any vertex corona consists of four unit cubes from some even layer , two unit cubes from an adjacent odd layer , and three prisms .",
