    "iridium - based compounds@xcite have spurred considerable interest because the interplay of strong atomic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , electronic correlations , crystal field effects , and sizable orbital overlaps in these compounds have been shown to give rise to exotic states of matter ranging from topological insulators to weyl semimetals and quantum spin liquids.@xcite drawing significant attention is the a@xmath4iro@xmath5 family of layered honeycomb iridates@xcite : these materials were first described by the kitaev model@xcite and later by the heisenberg - kitaev ( hk ) model@xcite , both of which hosts a @xmath6 quantum spin - liquid ground state first discovered in the context of kitaev s exactly solvable spin-1/2 model.@xcite subsequently , similar exactly solvable spin models on several other two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattices were investigated.@xcite    experimentally , the sodium honeycomb iridate  na@xmath4iro@xmath5has been shown to order magnetically in the zigzag phase@xcite , while the lithium counterpart ",
    "li@xmath7iro@xmath8is believed to also order magnetically but in a different ground state.@xcite the quest to find an appropriate minimal model that can explain the observed orders , low energy excitations , as well as bulk thermodynamic properties has been actively pursued . to address these points , localized pseudospin models involving exchanges in addition to the heisenberg and kitaev couplings",
    "have been considered , including the symmetry - allowed off - diagonal exchange@xcite , further neighbour exchanges@xcite , and distortion - induced anisotropies@xcite .",
    "electronic band structure calculations@xcite have also been investigated to further our understanding of these compounds .",
    "indeed , a suitable minimal model may predict the behaviour of these layered honeycomb iridates under a variety of perturbations and may direct us to the discovery of exotic physics , including the illusive quantum spin liquid phase .",
    "recently , two three - dimensional polymorphs of the layered honeycombs with chemical formula li@xmath7iro@xmath8 have been discovered , fuelling intrigue over the family of honeycomb - based iridate compounds .",
    "curiously , these two materials  the hyperhoneycomb ( @xmath9)@xcite and harmonic - honeycomb ( @xmath2)@xcite behave rather similarly : they have the same stoichiometry as the layered honeycomb with analogous three - dimensional crystal structures , they order magnetically with no net moment at similar temperatures ( @xmath10 ) , and their magnetization curves behave non - linearly at low fields . furthermore , thermodynamic measurements@xcite suggested that both 3d iridates might order unconventionally in a non - collinear fashion and recent single - crystal resonant magnetic x - ray diffraction experiments@xcite find a complex incommensurate structure with non - coplanar and counter - propagating moments in both iridates . indeed , with the discovery of these two 3d honeycomb compounds and to build on past work in both the intermediate - coupling regime@xcite and localized@xcite limits , the search for a relevant minimal model to describe the family of honeycomb iridates has now become more fascinating .",
    "can the same minimal model describe both the 2d and 3d honeycomb iridates while capturing the similarities and heterogeneity amongst these compounds ? in this work , driven by the fact that these compounds have similar local structures , we suggest that the nearest - neighbor @xmath11 model , which was recently used to describe the layered honeycomb iridates@xcite , is a good starting point in the discussion of this family of compounds , especially in regards to the magnetic order .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattices ] , by discussing the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices , drawing special attention to the similarities and differences between these three - dimensional analogues of the honeycomb lattice . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the minimal effective model of @xmath0 pseudospins that describes the low - energy physics of the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices in the mott insulating limit . the presence of the off - diagonal exchange term , @xmath1 , along with the familiar heisenberg and kitaev terms , is shown to be necessary from a strong - coupling expansion of the underlying , multi - band electronic model . following this , in sec .",
    "[ sec : pd ] we present the classical phase diagram of these models using a combination of luttinger - tisza approximation , single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization , and simulated annealing .",
    "we show that the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices have similar phase diagrams , but differ from the phase diagram of the 2d honeycomb iridates in important ways .",
    "in addition to analogues of the ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , zigzag , and stripy phases of the hk model , we find a number of non - coplanar , counter - propagating spiral phases , multiple-@xmath3 states , as well as phases that have no direct analogues in the hk - limit .",
    "we expound these phases and their static structure factors in sec .",
    "[ sec : orders ] , thus providing results that can be compared with experiments . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the relevance of our results to the newly discovered 3d - li@xmath7iro@xmath8 compounds .",
    "the ideal iridium ion ( ir ) network in the hyperhoneycomb ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hhc_lattice ] ) and @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : har_lattice ] ) lattices share many common features but also have some important differences . in this section",
    ", we highlight these main points and introduce conventions relevant to the description of the magnetic phases explored in sec .",
    "[ sec : orders ] .",
    "the conventional unit cells of both hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices are orthorhombic with the former being face - centered@xcite and the latter being base - centered@xcite .",
    "the hyperhoneycomb primitive unit cell has four ir while the @xmath2 primitive unit cell has eight ; hence , the conventional unit cell of hyperhoneycomb contains four primitive units while in the @xmath2 , there are two . in our chosen coordinate system , the conventional lattice vectors of both hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices",
    "are given by the orthorhombic set @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "all the ir sites reside in their respective oxygen octahedra and these octahedra share edges between nn ir sites .",
    "the ir sites are three - fold coordinated , with the three nn bonds labelled as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : hhc_lattice ] and [ fig : har_lattice ] . in the coordinate system that we have chosen ,",
    "the label represents the direction to which the bond is normal . for example , the sites joined by an @xmath15-bond form either the vector @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "we will see that this labelling scheme is also used in describing the low - energy hamiltonian of these lattices in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the hyperhoneycomb ( also known as the @xmath9 ) and @xmath2 lattices have been described as strips of layered honeycombs joined in an abab fashion along the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the a and b strips are mirrored copies of each other and are hence related by glide planes.@xcite in the @xmath21 notation , @xmath22 refers to the number of rows of hexagons in the each of the honeycomb strips . for the hyperhoneycomb lattice",
    ", @xmath23 indicates that no complete hexagons are present . for the @xmath2 lattice ,",
    "each honeycomb strip is one row in width . despite the difference in the topology of the ir network , the projection along the conventional planes ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 planes ) are identical between the two lattices .",
    "we define a _ honeycomb - plane _ associated with every site : it is the plane that is spanned by the site s three nn bonds . alternatively",
    ", it can be defined as the plane that contains the honeycomb strip to which the site belongs .",
    "since the honeycomb strips are related by glide planes , there are only two orientations that honeycomb - planes can take .",
    "the honeycomb - planes are important when discussing the magnetic orders in sec .",
    "[ sec : orders ] , especially for the spiral phases .",
    "all ir are symmetry - equivalent in the hyperhoneycomb lattice , but in the @xmath2 lattice , there are two inequivalent sets .",
    "these two inequivalent sets of ir in the @xmath2 lattice can be classified by considering whether the site shares the same honeycomb - plane with all its nns .",
    "we denote the sites that do nt share the same honeycomb - plane with all its nns as _ bridging - sites _ since they connect the a and b honeycomb strips .",
    "consequently , we call the @xmath17-bonds that connect bridging - sites _",
    "bridging-@xmath17-bonds _ , while the other symmetry - inequivalent @xmath17-bonds _ non - bridging-@xmath17-bonds_. this terminology is used in the discussion of the spin patterns in several of the magnetic orders .",
    "in compounds containing @xmath28 ions residing in oxygen octahedral crystal fields , the combination of large atomic spin - orbit coupling and strong electronic correlations can result in low - energy physics describable by highly anisotropic @xmath0 pseudospin models ( hereafter , we will use _ spin _ and _ pseudospin _ interchangeably for brevity).@xcite when the bonds are comprised of edge - shared octahedra , such as the nn bonds found in both the hyperhoneycomb and the @xmath2 lattices , a symmetric off - diagonal exchange term  denoted by @xmath1is generically present in addition to the heisenberg and kitaev exchange terms.@xcite as such , a minimal hamiltonian that describes the low - energy physics of these systems can be written as @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the @xmath0 pseudospin at site @xmath31 , the summation is over nn bonds @xmath32 labelled by @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is shorthand for @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 sign in front of @xmath1 is a reminder that , unlike the @xmath37 and @xmath38 terms , the @xmath1 term can have relative minus signs on different bonds .",
    "the sign structures of @xmath1 for both the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sign_lattice ] ( see appendix [ app : sign ] for details on the choice of the @xmath1 sign structure ) .",
    "the exchange interactions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath1 can be obtained microscopically via a strong coupling expansion of a @xmath39 multi - band tight - binding model with on - site interactions and large atomic soc .",
    "the details can be found in appendix [ app : model ] and ref . .",
    "here we summarize the exchange interactions dependence on the parameters of the multi - band hubbard model , which include coulomb repulsion @xmath40 , hund s coupling @xmath41 , spin - orbit coupling @xmath42 , and three @xmath39 hopping amplitudes denoted by @xmath43 through @xmath44 @xmath45\\nonumber \\\\",

    "furthermore , the signs of the exchange interactions sensitively depend on relative magnitudes and signs of @xmath43 through @xmath44 , which themselves are functions of slater - koster amplitudes@xcite that parametrize @xmath39 orbital overlaps and oxygen - iridium orbital overlaps ( details can be found in appendix [ app : model ] and ref . ) .",
    "generically , this sensitivity implies that all the phases we find are potentially experimentally relevant to the 3d - li@xmath7iro@xmath8 compounds .",
    "the nn @xmath0 pseudospin hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eq : ham ] describes the local , low - energy physics of the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices in the strong soc and electron correlation limit . unlike the 2d honeycomb iridates , both the hyperhoneycomb and the @xmath2 lattices are three - dimensional , thus making numerical techniques for quantum spin models , such as exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group , challenging to implement",
    "this is further exacerbated by the large unit cells in these 3d lattices : compared to the two ir ions in the 2d - honeycomb lattice s primitive unit cell , there are four and eight ir ions in the primitive unit cell for the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices , respectively .    although these numerical issues in the quantum analysis are difficult to overcome , a classical understanding of these three - dimensional pseudospin models is both important and relevant insomuch that the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 iridates are believed to be magnetically - ordered.@xcite a classical analysis may be sufficient since , in the 2d - honeycomb pseudospin model , the classical phase diagram well - approximated the magnetic phases found via exact diagonalization.@xcite furthermore , quantum fluctuations  the key ingredient in generating exotic , non - classical phases  are generally believed to be suppressed in 3d systems compared to 2d systems . to this end",
    ", we analyze the @xmath0 pseudospin hamiltonians of both hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 lattices in the classical limit using a combination of the luttinger - tisza approximation@xcite , single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization , and classical monte carlo simulated annealing .      in the luttinger - tisza approximation ( lta),@xcite",
    "the local constraint of @xmath46 is relaxed to a global constraint @xmath47 .",
    "the lowest energy configuration satisfying the global constraint can be easily solved in momentum space .",
    "this configuration is then checked against the local constraint : if it is satisfied , then the lta succeeded in finding the exact classical ground state ; otherwise , the lta failed but has instead found a lower bound of the ground state energy . in the parameter regions",
    "where lta failed , we implemented a combination of single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization and classical monte carlo simulated annealing to find the classical ground state configuration .    in the single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization , an upper bound to the classical energy",
    "is determined variationally by a trial spin configuration of the form @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the pseudospin on sublattice @xmath50 in the ( conventional ) unit cell @xmath51 , @xmath52 is an orthonormal set of vectors defining a local frame for sublattice @xmath50 , @xmath53 is the canting angle for sublattice @xmath50 , and @xmath3 is the @xmath3-vector common to all sublattices .",
    "the energy of this ansatz is minimized to find a variational bound to the classical ground state energy .",
    "since the wavevectors @xmath3 and @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is a reciprocal lattice vector ) parametrize the same set of spin configurations , we can restrict the domain over which minimization of @xmath3 is performed to the first brillouin zone .",
    "classical simulated annealing using the single - spin metropolis algorithm and periodic boundary conditions was performed in conjunction with the single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization .",
    "simulated annealing has the advantage over single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization in that it can access states that are characterized by multiple @xmath3-vectors and is less prone to being trapped by local minima in energy . on the other hand , although simulated annealing can access single-@xmath3 states given by eq .",
    "[ eq : singleqansatz ] , the allowable @xmath3-vectors must be commensurate with the finite system sizes chosen in our simulations . a saw - tooth like temperature annealing profile was used to better traverse the spin - configuration space and a minimum of @xmath56 sweeps ( updates per spin )",
    "were used for each simulation .    over 8000 @xmath57 parameter points for each lattice",

    "in addition , a minimum of @xmath62 single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization runs were also performed per parameter point .",
    "the minimum energy amongst these simulated annealing and single-@xmath3 ansatz minimization runs is deemed the variational bound of the ground state energy and the corresponding pseudospin configuration is used to characterize the magnetic order of the ground state at that parameter point .      before delving into the details of the classical magnetic ground states of eq .",
    "[ eq : ham ] , we first examine some general features of the hyperhoneycomb and @xmath2 phase diagrams , which were obtained via the methods outlined in sec .",

    ", we notice that the zigzag region has reduced in size and the spiral phases have become more prevalent .",
    "in particular , the 120@xmath75 phase of the 2d model is now a spiral phase in the two 3d models .    on the outer edges of the two phase diagrams ,",
    "@xmath1 vanishes and the hamiltonians reach the isotropic hk limit . with increasing @xmath65",

    "the centers of the phase diagrams are the @xmath1-only points .",
    "these points , much like in the 2d - honeycomb case , possess highly degenerate ground state manifolds.@xcite therefore , similar to the kitaev points , small perturbations can drive different magnetic orders . as a result , we see that a number of phases converge at these highly - degenerate points .",
    "the effects of a finite @xmath1 is most pronounced near the kitaev points where the highly degenerate classical ground state manifolds can be lifted by small perturbations . as a result ,",
    "finite @xmath1 in these regions generates new magnetic orders that are not continuously connected with those found along the hk limit .",
    "of the eight new magnetic orders , four are incommensurate spiral phases ( sp@xmath80 , sp@xmath81 , sp@xmath82 , and sp@xmath83 ) , two are multiple-@xmath3 states ( mq@xmath84 and mq@xmath4 ) , one is an antiferromagnetic state ( af - sz@xmath85 ) , and one has finite net moment ( fm - sz@xmath85 ) .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experiments , we consider a generic spin model in the @xmath0 basis for the hyperhoneycomb and harmonic - honeycomb iridates . based on microscopic considerations , the effect of an additional bond - dependent anisotropic spin exchange interaction ( @xmath1 ) beyond the heisenberg - kitaev model is investigated </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the magnetic phase diagrams of the hyperhoneycomb and harmonic - honeycomb ( @xmath2 ) lattices via a combination of the luttinger - tisza approximation , single-@xmath3 variational ansatz , and classical monte carlo simulated annealing . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagrams on both systems show the existence of incommensurate , non - coplanar spiral magnetic orders as well as other commensurate magnetic orders . </S>",
    "<S> the spiral orders show counter - propagating spiral patterns , which may be favorably compared to recent experimental results on both iridates . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter regime of various magnetic orders and ordering wavevectors are quite similar in both systems . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our work to recent experiments and also compare our results to those of the two dimensional honeycomb iridate systems . </S>"
