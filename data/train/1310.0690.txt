    "some relatively recent strategies in nonlinear analysis techniques are based on the mapping of time series into graphs according to different algorithms and criteria ( see for instance @xcite ) and on the subsequent study of the associated graphs .",
    "topological features of the associated graphs are then related to dynamical aspects of the systems that generated the series and these methods are used for feature classification based analysis of complex signals . + amongst them , the so called horizontal visibility algorithm ( hva ) @xcite can be distinguished from others by being capable of distilling time series , condensing classes of them into a single graph whose structural properties represent the basic common dynamical properties of the series .",
    "the method uncovers structural features and forms sets of time series with the same feature by their representative hv graph ensemble , excluding from the ensemble those that lack that feature .",
    "the kernel dynamics in each case is well captured by the associated graphs , such that when the hv method is applied to a time series of unknown source , inspection of the resulting graph provides basic information about its underlying dynamics",
    ". some relevant applications of this approach include the discrimination of reversible from irreversible dynamics @xcite , the characterization of chaotic and stochastic signals @xcite or , in general , applications to series classification problems where the hv is used as the feature extraction method ( see @xcite for a recent review )",
    ". however , from a theoretic point of view , the method is still in its infancy and graph - theoretical descriptions of nontrivial dynamics are in general open problems .",
    "this is specially important within this methodology , which has been proved to be simple enough to be addressed analytically instead of being yet another ( black box ) classification method , while at the same time being accurate and powerful for series classification .",
    "+ in the context of low - dimensional chaos , two of the canonical routes to chaos ( feigenbaum scenario and quasiperiodic route ) have been studied from this perspective and complete sets of graphs that encode the dynamics of their corresponding classes of iterated maps have been introduced and characterized @xcite .",
    "the third canonical route to chaos is the so called pomeau - manneville or intermittency route @xcite . under the generic term intermittency several dynamical behaviours with a common feature",
    "can be considered .",
    "the common feature is the alternation of ( pseudoperiodic ) laminar episodes with sporadic break - ups or bursts between them called intermissions .",
    "intermittent behaviour can indeed be observed experimentally in many situations such as belousov - zhabotinski chemical reactions , rayleigh - benard instabilities , or turbulence @xcite and has been deeply studied in the context of nonlinear sciences . as a result of this ,",
    "a characterization of the onset mechanisms and main statistical properties of intermittency have been described and typified : from the classification of types i , ii and iii intermittency by pomeau and manneville @xcite to other more recent types such as on - off intermittency @xcite or ring intermittency @xcite .",
    "+ the theoretical description of type - i intermittency from a horizontal visibility perspective has been advanced recently @xcite . in the present contribution",
    "we extend the hv description to type - ii intermittency and present the structural , scaling and entropic properties of the graphs obtained when the hv formalism is applied to the type - ii intermittency case , further advancing the hv theory .",
    "we recall here that type - ii as described by pomeau and manneville in their seminar paper @xcite is not only of theoretical interest , but indeed constitutes a physical mechanism which has been experimentally identified , for example , in coupled nonlinear oscillators @xcite or hydrodinamic systems @xcite .",
    "+ in the following we first recall in section ii the key aspects of type - ii intermittency .",
    "in section iii we outline the basic methodology defined as the horizontal visibility algorithm and apply it to the study of trajectories generated by iterated maps close to a neimark - sacker bifurcation , where type - ii intermittency takes place .",
    "an heuristic derivation of an analytical expression for the degree distribution @xmath0 of this kind of graphs is performed .",
    "this graph measure encodes the key scaling property of type - ii intermittency : the mean length @xmath1 of the laminar episodes with @xmath2 manifests in network realm as a comparable scaling with the same variable of the second moment @xmath3 of the degree distribution @xmath4 . in turn , the scaling of lyapunov exponent @xmath5 is recovered in network space , via pesin - like identity , from shannon block entropies @xmath6 over @xmath7 , whose block-@xmath8 entropy @xmath9 is only a first order approximation . in section",
    "iv we recast the family of hv graphs generated by intermittent series into a graph - theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) framework and determine the rg flows close to and at the bifurcation point .",
    "as in other transition - to - chaos scenarios @xcite , we find two trivial fixed points of the rg flow ( akin to the high and low temperature fixed points in thermal phase transitions ) which are the attractors of regular and chaotic dynamics respectively , together with a nontrivial fixed point associated to critical ( null lyapunov exponent ) dynamics .",
    "for definiteness we chose the case of type - ii intermittency @xcite as it develops for nonlinear iterated maps in the vicinity of a neimark - sacker bifurcation .",
    "as a canonical example of a discrete system exhibiting this type of dynamics let us consider the iterated complex map : @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "if we rewrite the variable @xmath13 in its polar form @xmath14 , we can decompose the dynamics of the system in a rotation of its argument @xmath15 and a nonlinear dynamics in its modulus @xmath16 .",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the modulus @xmath16 , which is where intermittency appears : @xmath17 with a choice of @xmath18 for simplicity . +",
    "this one dimensional iterated map has an unstable fixed point in @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "if no additional constraints were imposed the map would diverge for initial conditions larger than zero , however , we can bound the phase space by introducing a modular congruence in the definition of this map @xmath21 the trajectories of this map are monotonically increasing functions up to a certain value @xmath22 that fulfills @xmath23 . then",
    ", the modular congruency reinjects it _ somewhere _ in the vicinity of the unstable fixed point @xmath24 , where they remain for a _",
    "certain _ time ( a certain number of iterations ) @xmath25 until they escape , go beyond @xmath26 and are reinjected once again ( see figure [ series ] for a graphical illustration ) .",
    "reinjections close to the unstable fixed point take long journeys to depart from its neighborhood , and are experimentally seen as pseudoperiodic ( laminar ) phases .",
    "chaotic bursts are actually concatenation of short trends generated out from reinjections far from the unstable fixed point ( see in figure [ series ] the alternation between long laminar phases and chaotic bursts , governed by the location of the reinjection value ) .",
    "+ note that there is also a second value @xmath27 very close to @xmath8 that fulfills @xmath28 from which the trajectories are also reinjected in the vicinity of @xmath29 . as a numeric guide , for @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this map densely fill the phase space [ 0,1 ] and evidence sensitivity to initial conditions for @xmath33 , regular dynamics for @xmath34 @xcite and criticality at @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath2 actually determines the distance of the system to the bifurcation .",
    "+        a paradigmatic feature of type - ii intermittency is the scaling of the mean length of the laminar trends @xmath36 .",
    "this scaling is suggested by assuming the laminar trends to start at a @xmath37 close enough to the fixed point of our map ( @xmath24 ) , such that @xmath38 this lead us by recurrence to @xmath39x_0\\approx(1+\\epsilon\\ell ) x_0\\ ] ] with @xmath40 the value at which we can consider the laminar trend is over . from the former expression we get : @xmath41 and averaging @xmath42 for different initial values @xmath43 of the trend , we get @xmath44 \\left(\\left\\langle{x_0^{-1}}\\right\\rangle x_{\\ell}-1\\right)\\epsilon^{-1},\\ \\left\\langle{x_0^{-1}}\\right\\rangle=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{x_{0_i}}. % \\sim \\epsilon^{-1}.\\ ] ] +        however , note that the definition of a laminar trend is somewhat ad - hoc , as we shall define what we consider to be such a phase , that is , when do we consider that the trajectory has escaped laminarity . accordingly , the mean length of laminar trends @xmath45 is not a variable that directly contains information particularly relevant from the point of view of the graph theoretical description as we shall later see .",
    "a more objective measure is the time @xmath25 between reinjections ( or its mean value @xmath46 ) .",
    "an expression for this variable @xmath25 as a function of the initial value @xmath47 can be found by taking the continuous limit and traducing our map to a flow : @xmath48 assuming a relatively small initial time ( @xmath49 ) this integration is straightforward and lead us to the following expression : @xmath50 where @xmath47 is the initial or so called reinjection value ( see fig .",
    "[ t_x0_fig ] ) .",

    "[ t_x0 ] we have that @xmath55 in absence of a more detailed description , we may assume in a first approximation that @xmath53 is reasonably uniformly distributed in the interval [ 0,1 ] which takes the role of the phase space of our system ( @xmath56\\rightarrow f(x_0)=1 $ ] ) .",
    "this yields the following density : @xmath57\\left|\\frac{dx_0(t)}{dt}\\right|=a\\epsilon^{3/2}\\frac{e^{2\\epsilon t}}{(ae^{2\\epsilon t}-1)^{3/2}}\\approx \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\frac{a\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{2}t^{-1},\\ t_m \\gg t \\\\",

    "note that , if we expand our interval of initial conditions in the reinjection to the whole phase space @xmath71 $ ] , we recover @xmath25 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the horizontal visibility ( hv ) algorithm @xcite assigns each datum @xmath73 of a time series @xmath74 to a node @xmath75 in its associated hv graph ( hvg ) , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are two connected nodes if @xmath77 for all @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting are outerplanar graphs connected through a hamiltonian path @xcite whose structural properties capture the statistics enclosed in the associated series @xcite .",
    "a relevant measure is the degree distribution @xmath80 , that accounts for the probability of a randomly chosen node to have degree @xmath81 , which has been showed to encode key dynamical properties such as fractality , chaoticity or reversibility to cite some @xcite .",
    "+        for illustrative purposes , in figure [ cartoon ] we represent a sketch of a type - ii intermittent series along with its associated hv graph . at odds with the phenomenology of type - i intermittency , whose mapping consisted of several repetitions of a @xmath82-node motif ( periodic backbone of period @xmath82 associated to the ghost of the period 3 series ) linked to the first node of the following laminar trend and interwoven with the chaotically connected nodes associated to the chaotic bursts between laminar trends @xcite ,",
    "the case of type - ii lacks any periodic backbone or chaotic burst , and consists of nodes associated to reinjections and nodes linked to the last node of the previous reinjection .",
    "that is , the method naturally distinguishes reinjections from each other and do not include the ( nonetheless ambiguous ) distinction between laminarity and burstiness .",
    "accordingly , we can classify nodes in three different categories ( see fig . [ cartoon ] ) : + a ) nodes located just before a reinjection @xmath83 , whose degree distribution will be later discussed in detail , + b ) nodes located just after a reinjection @xmath84 , with a trivial degree distribution ( @xmath85 ) and + c ) the rest of the nodes @xmath75 , whose degree distribution is also trivial ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "+ based on these observations , in what follows we derive some topological properties of these graphs and will show that they indeed incorporate the main statistical properties of type - ii intermittency .",
    "consider the degree distribution @xmath80 , that describes the probability that a randomly chosen node of a graph has @xmath81 links ( degree @xmath81 ) .",
    "the previous features allow us to decompose the degree distribution of type - ii intermittency graphs as a weighted sum of the aforementioned contributions : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the reinjection fraction @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the number of reinjections that have occurred up to time @xmath78 .",
    "on the other hand , the degree of the nodes before a reinjection can be decomposed in two different contributions @xmath91 .",
    "the first term @xmath25 consists on the visibility the node has over the following laminar trend up to the next reinjection and it is distributed like @xmath92 .",
    "the second term @xmath93 comes from the visibility the node has over the rest of the reinjections and its distribution can be supposed to be the characteristic exponential distribution found in hvg s that come from stochastic / chaotic processes like a reinjection : @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "we have one further consideration : by construction , the degree of these nodes has an additional restriction : @xmath95 . as an approach",
    ", we can assume @xmath96 or , equivalently , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the degree distribution for these nodes turns out to be : @xmath98 in figure [ p_k_fig ] we plot in log - log the approximate theoretical expression for the degree distribution @xmath4 , for a concrete value of @xmath30 , along with the numerics .          in this section",
    "we are going to verify our previous hypothesis @xmath100 by deducing an expression for the mean value of the degree distribution @xmath101 , and we are going to analyze how the second order moment of the distribution @xmath102 inherits the scaling of @xmath103 .",
    "let us start with the mean degree @xmath101 .",
    "recall that hv graphs associated to generic aperiodic series tend , as size increases , to a constant mean degree @xmath104 @xcite and that hvgs are , by construction , connected graphs where node @xmath105 has degree @xmath106 ( they have a hamiltonian path ) . then , @xmath107 this expression tell us that the mean value of the connectivity of the nodes before reinjetion @xmath108 behaves as the inverse of the reinjection fraction @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , we can express the reinjection fraction as : @xmath110 for which we have assumed that the number of nodes between reinjections is quite the same as the number of reinjections multiplied by the mean value of the reinjection time ( @xmath111 ) , which gives a compact expression @xmath112 that indicates the behaviour of @xmath113 and @xmath52 coincides up to first order , and that @xmath88 goes to zero as @xmath114 .",
    "+ if we now move to the second order moment , we get : @xmath115 and following our hypothesis we can approximate @xmath116 @xmath117 where the last formula requires small values of @xmath2 and @xmath118 .",
    "as @xmath119 for small values of @xmath2 , in this low limit we have a leading order of @xmath120 which reproduces the expected scaling ( see figure [ t_l_var_k ] for a comparison with numerics ) .",
    "we conclude that the scaling of the mean length of laminar phases with @xmath2 is inherited in network space by a similar scaling in the variance of the degree distribution .",
    "the second paradigmatic feature of type - ii intermittency is the scaling of the lyapunov exponent @xmath121 ( which for a map @xmath122 reads @xmath123 ) with respect to the distance to criticality @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "note that lyapunov exponents characterize a purely dynamical feature and , although some graph - theoretical extensions of these exponents have been recently advanced @xcite , it is not evident at all how to cast this dynamical behaviour into a graph - theoretical realm .",
    "however , note that pesin identity relates positive lyapunov exponents of chaotic trajectories with kolmogorov - sinai rate entropy in dynamical systems . based on this identity ,",
    "a relation between lyapunov exponents of maps and shannon - like entropies over the degree distribution of the associated visibility graphs has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the block-@xmath8 graph theoretical entropy @xmath9 @xcite is defined as @xmath125 and block-@xmath126 entropies take into account of higher order statistics of blocks @xmath127 .",
    "+ an approximate leading order calculation for @xmath9 can be performed assuming @xmath128 and recalling that the rest of the terms in @xmath80 only contribute for @xmath129 .",

    "let us pay attention to the last integral , which can be evaluated by a time scale separation for short ( @xmath132 ) and long times ( @xmath60 ) as in ( [ g_t ] ) :    @xmath133    @xmath134    after a brief inspection , we conclude that for small values of @xmath2 , the leading term of @xmath9 is not exactly @xmath135 but @xmath136 , what should yield an approximate scaling albeit with a smaller exponent . in figure [ lyap_h1 ]",
    "we plot in log - log the numerical results of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath2 , together with the numerics of @xmath5 in the same range ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath9 shows a reasonably similar scaling , although with a slightly smaller exponent ( the numerical fit is @xmath138 ) .",
    "+ if we now proceed as in @xcite and we increase the size @xmath126 of the block in the graph - theoretical entropy @xmath6 : @xmath139 we numerically observe a tendency in the scaling behaviour @xmath140 that suggests @xmath141 and therefore points towards a graph theoretical pesin identity @xmath142 numerical evidence for these latter results are shown in figure [ lyap - h_n ] .",
    "as in previous works @xcite , we can define a renormalization group ( rg ) transformation @xmath143 on the hv graphs @xmath144 as the coarse - graining of every couple of adjacent nodes where at least one of them has degree @xmath145 into a block node that inherits the links of the previous two nodes .",
    "in other words , the operation removes form the graph every node of degree @xmath145 along with its two links . assuming infinitely long series ( in order to avoid the rescaling procedure in standard rg ) , in what follows we argue that the flow induced by iteratively performing this rg operation classifies dynamics coming from above and below transition , although the phase portrait turns to be very different from the one found in type - i intermittency @xcite .",
    "* when @xmath34 , trajectories are damped and rapidly converge to a constant series @xmath146 , so after a transient the associated hvg @xmath147 will be a chain graph with @xmath145 for all nodes @xcite . a graph which is indeed the rg attractor of regular dynamics , invariant under renormalization @xmath148 @xcite and represents a minimum for the entropy functional @xmath149 .",

    "the analogous flow in graph space slowly converges towards @xmath151 , the universal hv graph associated to an uncorrelated series , which constitutes a stable fixed point of the rg flow @xmath152 @xcite . as it has been proved that @xmath151 is a maximally entropic hv graph @xcite",
    ", we conclude that the rg flow @xmath153 increases the entropy of the system as it breaks correlations .",
    "* at the bifurcation ( @xmath35 ) the trajectories are monotonically increasing series bounded at @xmath154 by a large value ( the ghost of the intermittent regime ) , which maps into a hv graph which is itself indeed invariant under renormalization @xmath155 ( see figure [ rg ] for a graphical illustration ) .",
    "its degree distribution can be described for a graph of @xmath156 nodes ( where the limit @xmath157 will be taken afterwards ) as @xmath158 , yielding also a null entropy @xmath149 in the limit of diverging sizes .",
    "this constitutes the third fixed point of the rg flow .",
    "note that this fixed point is different from @xmath159 , nonetheless , they both share the same entropy .",
    "the reason is that there is no actual parsimonious trajectory connecting @xmath160 to @xmath161 , once you apply an infinitisemal perturbation making @xmath34 , after a ( large transient ) you reach the stationary damped solution @xmath162 , whose associated hvg is directly @xmath159 .",

    "any positive perturbation in @xmath2 is amplified in the rg flow , taking the graph to @xmath151 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath160 is an unstable fixed point of the rg flow .",
