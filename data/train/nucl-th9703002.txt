    "during the past few years a large number of experimental and theoretical investigations of @xmath0 meson photoproduction on nucleon and nuclei has been undertaken .",
    "because of the isoscalar nature of the @xmath0 meson , these reactions yield unique information concerning the properties of baryon resonances with isospin t=1/2 .",
    "most of the past theoretical work was devoted to the study of the @xmath3 resonance and its properties in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this resonance has a dominant contribution in @xmath0 production on the nucleon near threshold because of its strong coupling to the @xmath8 channel . as a consequence ,",
    "the observation of other resonances and of the nonresonant terms is possible only via their interference with the dominant @xmath3 excitation amplitude .",
    "therefore , theoretical predictions about their properties extracted from the @xmath9 analysis depend considerably on the @xmath3 parameters which are not well known yet . this problem may be solved by studying @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei which can be used as spin - isospin filters allowing one to investigate the individual parts of the elementary amplitude .    in this spirit , the coherent @xmath0 photoproduction on spin - isospin saturated nuclei is of special interest , because in these processes the @xmath3 resonance is suppressed , and thus the corresponding cross sections are sensitive to the `` small '' parts of the elementary photoproduction operator . on the other hand , a disadvantage of such reactions is the difficulty of their experimental isolation due to the smallness of the coherent cross section compared to the background quasifree process @xmath10 . as a consequence , rather little effort has been devoted to their theoretical study .",
    "this situation will probably change in the near future with new measurements of @xmath0 photoproduction on nuclei with c.w .",
    "electron machines , like for example , on @xmath1he with mami @xcite . in anticipation of such experiments , we present here theoretical results for @xmath0 photoproduction on spin - isospin saturated nuclei , for which we have chosen as specific examples @xmath1he and @xmath2c .",
    "an early , rather detailed study of these processes was performed by bennhold and tanabe @xcite .",
    "their elementary model , based on a coupled channel approach , gave a satisfactory description of the at that time available data on the @xmath11 reaction , which , however , were not very precise .",
    "their approach is a pure isobar model and does not include any background terms . on the other hand , such terms _ a priori _",
    "give nonnegligible contributions to the elementary amplitude and their role in coherent reactions may be important .",
    "therefore , with the appearance of new precise @xmath12 data @xcite it is interesting to review the theoretical results for @xmath0 photoproduction on such nuclei by including such background terms .",
    "our treatment of the elementary process follows the effective lagrangian approach used for the analysis of meson photoproduction by many authors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 amplitude is obtained by means of second - order feynman diagrams for the nucleon pole and vector mesons exchange as well as for the resonant states which are expected to give significant contributions to @xmath0 photoproduction in the near - threshold region .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it gives a production operator valid for an arbitrary frame in a rather simple analytical form which is convenient for the implementation into the nuclear @xmath14 process .",

    "this question will be addressed in the next section .    the spin - dependent amplitude @xmath68 , which is dominated by the @xmath3 excitation , plays a major role in @xmath0 photoproduction on a free nucleon .",

    "the functional form ( [ fhe ] ) allows also a simple analytic expression for the momentum space representation @xmath131 which is needed for the explicit evaluation of the fermi motion in the integral of ( [ 7f ] ) .",
    "we begin the discussion of our results with the total cross sections for the coherent reactions @xmath1he@xmath132he and @xmath2c@xmath133c which are shown in fig .",
    "[ figtot ] .",
    "one readily notes that the coherent cross section on @xmath134 nuclei is very small in magnitude , of the relative order of @xmath135 , compared to the incoherent process ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the suppression of the in the elementary reaction dominant @xmath3 resonance .",
    "another reason is that the coherent nuclear transition amplitude via the body form factor falls off rapidly at the high momentum transfers associated with the @xmath0 production .",
    "although the coherence factor @xmath136 is nine times bigger for @xmath2c compared to @xmath1he , the cross section for @xmath2c is considerably smaller because of the much faster fall - off of the body form factor with momentum transfer @xmath137 .",
    "the contributions of the individual terms of our elementary @xmath9 model are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ c12_1 ] for the differential cross section of @xmath2c . as mentioned before , the @xmath3 resonance has some influence on the non - spin - flip part of the elementary operator .",
    "but as one can see on the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ c12_1 ] , this effect remains negligible , since the isoscalar part of the @xmath3 amplitude , used in our calculation , is rather small ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "it is obvious that of the vector mesons only the isoscalar @xmath6 meson contributes to the amplitude here .",
    "in fact , one can see on the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ c12_1 ] that this term dominates the nuclear cross section , while the isoscalar part of the nucleon pole terms gives also an insignificant contribution .    as for the @xmath4 resonance , we have taken into account a possible modification of its properties in a nuclear environment .",
    "experimental results on total photoabsorption @xcite as well as @xmath139 photoproduction on light nuclei @xcite show a strong depletion of the resonance structure in the region of the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "this effect may be attributed to a strong shortening of the @xmath4 lifetime in a nucleus , where additional absorption channels , involving inelastic @xmath140 collisions , increase the resonance width .",
    "we have simulated such effects in our calculations by simply replacing the free resonance width by an effective one , i.e. , @xmath141 .",
    "the value @xmath142 mev for the @xmath4 was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the analysis of total photoabsorption on @xmath143be and @xmath2c .",
    "a questionable point of this treatment is that the parameters , extracted from @xmath143be and @xmath2c data , may not be appropriate for such a light nucleus like @xmath1he .",
    "however , we believe that the possible error is not dramatic and does not lead to a qualitative change of the results . this medium modification of the @xmath4 width leads to a noticable damping of its contribution to the cross section , as is demonstrated in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ c12_1 ] . in summary",
    ", our calculation shows a clear dominance of @xmath6 exchange in the coherent cross section for spin - isospin saturated nuclei , while the role of the nucleon pole terms as well as of the resonances is not important .",
    "another remark about the role of the @xmath4 resonance is concerned with the fact , that @xmath6 exchange contributes to the real part of the @xmath0 production amplitude only , while the real part of the amplitude of the @xmath4 , located near the @xmath0 production threshold , is relatively small .",
    "for this reason , we find very little interference between these amplitudes in the nuclear cross section .",
    "this is in marked contrast to a very recent result of @xcite where a strong constructive interference between vector meson exchange and @xmath4 excitation increases the cross section of the coherent reaction on @xmath144ca substantially .",
    "the reason is not clear to us .",
    "now we turn to the discussion of the exact treatment of the nuclear fermi motion . in the explicit evaluation of the integral in ( [ 7f ] ) ,",
    "one faces the problem of fixing the invariant mass of the @xmath34 subsystem @xmath145 in fact , this question is connected with the choice of the energy of the active bound nucleon in the off - shell region , where @xmath146 . the analogous problem for the coherent process on the deuteron",
    "has already been discussed in ref .",
    "there it was shown that various prescriptions for @xmath7 lead to significantly different results .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the @xmath0 photoproduction on the deuteron is dominated by the @xmath3 resonance , and thus the corresponding amplitude depends directly on @xmath7 appearing in the resonance propagator .",
    "in addition , the choice of @xmath7 has a large influence on the width @xmath147 to which the cross section is also very sensitive .    on the other hand , in view of the dominant @xmath5-channel @xmath6 exchange for the coherent @xmath14 processes considered here",
    ", one would expect that the cross section will be rather insensitive to the different assumptions on @xmath7 . in order to investigate this question ,",
    "we have considered for the @xmath1he@xmath132he reaction the following alternative prescriptions for @xmath7 in the @xmath148he c.m .",
    "system : @xmath149^{1/2 } , \\\\ w_{\\gamma n}^{(2 ) } & = & \\big[(k_0+\\sqrt{p^2+m^2})^2- ( \\vec{k}+\\vec{p } ) ^2\\big]^{1/2},\\label{11g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the @xmath1he c.m .",
    "energy in the initial state .",
    "the first choice ( [ 11f ] ) corresponds to the assumption , that all nucleons share equally the total energy of @xmath1he in its rest system @xmath150 in the second expression ( [ 11 g ] ) , the active nucleon is taken on - shell before the production process .",
    "this case has also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath151he@xmath152h reaction .",
    "our results , corresponding to the different choices of @xmath7 are shown in fig .",
    "the only term , which can be significantly affected by the value of @xmath7 and which can have some noticeable influence on the cross section , is the @xmath4 excitation term in our model .",
    "we note that in the whole region of nucleon momentum @xmath102 one has the relation @xmath153 because the binding energy of the nucleon , which is taken into account in ( [ 11f ] ) , decreases its total energy .",
    "thus the different choices for @xmath7 lead to different results for the magnitude and position of the @xmath4 resonance in the nuclear cross section . however , since the resonance contribution is small , the influence of this uncertainity in @xmath7 is not significant as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ w ] .    in this figure",
    "we also display the @xmath1he@xmath132he angular distribution obtained within the factorization approximation ( [ 8f ] ) , where the elementary amplitude is taken on - shell . the rather small difference between the corresponding curves shows , that the exact treatment of fermi motion differs little from the factorization approach which might not be so surprising after all , because of the dominance of @xmath6 exchange .",
    "therefore , we use this approximation in the following calculations .",
    "the study of @xmath0 photoproduction on the free nucleon indicates , that the role of @xmath6 exchange in this reaction is relatively small , because of the small radiative coupling @xmath154 to the @xmath155-channel . as a result ,",
    "the elementary cross section is rather insensitive to the uncertainities in the @xmath6 parameters .",
    "however , from our analysis of the coherent @xmath14 process on @xmath79 nuclei , where the @xmath6 exchange dominates , it is expected that these uncertainities will be reflected in the nuclear cross section .",
    "we therefore have also investigated the sensitivity of the @xmath1he@xmath132he reaction to the choice of the vector coupling constant @xmath156 for which one finds a significant variation of values in the literature @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we have used @xmath157 which is close to the quark model prediction @xmath15811.5 @xcite . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite a value @xmath156=17.5 has been chosen in order to reproduce the near - threshold @xmath159 data .",
    "the resulting cross section using this value of @xmath156 is shown in fig .",
    "as one can see , with the larger coupling constant the cross section increases by about a factor of 3 , which is roughly the square of the ratio of the coupling constants .",
    "in principle , this high sensitivity to the @xmath6 exchange makes it possible to determine the value of the @xmath160 coupling constant by a precise measurement of coherent @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath79 nuclei provided that neglected two - body effects are small indeed .",
    "we have furthermore checked the frame independence of the calculation by comparing the c.m .",
    "differential cross section obtained directly in the c.m .",
    "frame with the one evaluated first in the lab frame according to ( [ 5fl ] ) and then transformed with the help of the jacobian ( [ jac ] ) to the c.m .",
    "the resulting cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ figlabcm ] for @xmath1he .",
    "indeed , the differences are very small indicating that c.m .",

    "finally , we compare in fig .",
    "[ bennh ] our results for @xmath1he@xmath132he with those obtained by other authors .",

    "the isoscalar @xmath161 multipole from the @xmath4 resonance plays a dominant role in @xmath1he@xmath132he reaction , while the nonresonant terms were omitted .",
    "this is quite contrary to our conclusion , that @xmath6 exchange gives the major mechanism of coherent @xmath14 processes on @xmath134 nuclei .",

    "furthermore , as was discussed above , we have taken into account the broadening of the @xmath4 resonance in a nuclear environment , reducing further its contribution to @xmath14 reactions .",

    "the elementary production operator was obtained in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "two resonances , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as well as nucleon pole terms and vector meson exchange in the @xmath5-channel were included .",
    "one main point of this work was to investigate the influence of these different contributions on the coherent @xmath14 reaction on nuclei with zero spin and isospin , where the dominant contribution from the @xmath3 resonance is suppressed .",
    "our calculations show that the reaction is dominated by the @xmath6 exchange in the @xmath5-channel , while the role of the @xmath4 resonance and other terms is rather small .",
    "such `` nonresonant '' character leads to some peculiarities of the nuclear cross section .",
    "for example , we see little sensitivity of the theoretical results to the different assumptions about the invariant mass of the @xmath34 subsystem in the off - shell region .",

    "this is in contrast to its small contribution to the @xmath11 reaction .",
