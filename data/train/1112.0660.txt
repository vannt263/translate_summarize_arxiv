    "atom traps combining magnetic and optical potentials have been used since the achievement of the first bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in 1995  @xcite .",
    "they take advantage of the large trapping volume offered by magnetic quadrupole traps which facilitate the loading of a large atom number from magneto - optical traps ( mots ) .",
    "moreover , they allow for efficient evaporative cooling dynamics thanks to the initial linear shape of the confinement , while still offering large trapping frequencies at the end of the evaporation .",
    "furthermore , they prevent the trapped atoms from undergoing majorana spin flips  @xcite , relying on the dipole force induced by a laser beam to push the atoms outside the low - magnetic - field region where these losses are the highest .",
    "while solutions relying on red - detuned lasers have been demonstrated  @xcite , an alternative consists in using a blue - detuned laser as an optical plug at the center of the magnetic quadrupole trap ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : plugged_trap ] .",
    "the latter strategy has the advantage of minimizing resonant scattering processes responsible for atom losses and heating .",
    "a widespread choice for the design of the optical plug consists in using standard lasers at 532 nm .",
    "these lasers indeed commonly reach several watts of power and have long demonstrated their stability and reliability .",
    "this design is particularly well suited for @xmath1na ( sodium ) atoms , given the vicinity of the @xmath2 lines at 589 nm .",
    "it has hence recently allowed for the fast preparation of large @xmath1na becs  @xcite .    here",
    "we show that the same setup can also be used to efficiently obtain @xmath0rb ( rubidium ) becs despite the large detuning of the optical plug laser from the @xmath0rb main transition at 780 nm .",
    "indeed , we are able to keep at all times a high collision rate while minimizing majorana losses by modifying the trap shape during the evaporative cooling ramp .",
    "we typically obtain @xmath3 atoms in a quasi - pure bec after a total evaporation time of 20s .",

    "[ fig : plugged_trap ] .",
    "when the plug beam is centered exactly at the magnetic field zero , we are able to derive analytical expressions for the trap position and its corresponding oscillation frequencies , as well as to quantify the sensitivity of these quantities to the relevant experimental parameters .",
    "these results are generalized to the case of a slightly off - centered plug beam .",
    "this study allows us to infer the dependence of the trap characteristics on the experimental parameters and in turn to estimate the heating rate due to their fluctuations , in particular regarding beam pointing stability .",
    "as stated in the introduction , optically plugged quadrupole traps result from the combination of a quadrupole magnetic field with a blue detuned laser beam focused near the symmetry center of the quadrupole , where the magnetic field is zero .",
    "taking into account the gravitational field as well , the corresponding potential can be written @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the magnetic component of the potential , @xmath8 its optical component , @xmath9 the atomic mass , and @xmath10 the gravity acceleration .",
    "depending on the relative choice of the quadrupole magnetic field s orientation to the plug beam direction , different trap configurations are possible : there can be a single minimum  @xcite , a pair of minima  @xcite or an infinite number of degenerate minima spread over a circle  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will consider only the case of a plug beam propagating along one of the horizontal axes of a magnetic quadrupole field of vertical symmetry axis , which corresponds to our experimental configuration ( see fig .",

    "nevertheless , our main conclusions remain valid if the plug beam is slightly off centered , the trap positions and the corresponding oscillation frequencies being only weakly affected .",
    "symmetries of the potential @xmath31 allow us to make a few general statements about the trap geometry .",
    "first of all , the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath4 is restricted to the term @xmath20 , even in @xmath4 , which imposes the requirement that all the potential minima ( and saddle points ) should belong to the @xmath33 plane .",

    "the two saddle points belong to the @xmath35 plane , and the two trap minima are symmetric with respect to this plane . in the following",
    "we will hence concentrate on the minimum located on the right side @xmath36 .",
    "because of gravity , the trap depth is limited by the lower saddle point belonging to the @xmath11 axis , at position @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .    minimizing eq .",

    "the first relation is usually verified since with typical experimental parameters gravity is small compared to the magnetic field gradient .",

    "we now perform a harmonic approximation of the potential at the position of the minimum @xmath36 and derive the corresponding oscillation frequencies :    @xmath55    [ eq : freq_osc ]    the frequency @xmath56 appears as the natural frequency scale of the trap and is generally the smallest one . interestingly , from eqs .   and",
    ", we see that @xmath56 is completely determined by the value of the magnetic field at the trap minimum , @xmath49 , and the magnetic field gradient @xmath15 through the relation @xmath57 .    the two largest frequencies @xmath58 and @xmath59 correspond to the eigenaxes @xmath60 and @xmath61 which are rotated with respect to the @xmath34 and @xmath11 axes by the angle @xmath30 , defined by @xmath62 ( see also fig .

    "the coordinates of the center of the trap are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the positions of the saddle points as well as the trap depth can also be calculated analytically .",
    "the exact expression is somewhat complicated .",
    "however , we notice that the distance of the saddle point from the center is of the same order as the distance @xmath39 or @xmath50 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath66 is then about the same at both positions , whereas the contribution of @xmath20 is twice as large at the saddle point , due to the larger gradient along @xmath11 .",
    "including the effect of gravity , we can thus estimate the trap depth to be @xmath67 .        from eq .   and setting @xmath68",

    ", we can estimate the maximum allowed density power spectrum of relative fluctuations of @xmath15 , @xmath25 and @xmath21 that ensure a linear heating rate @xmath74 and an exponential heating rate @xmath75 below an arbitrary given threshold .",
    "as the trap minimum always lies in the plane @xmath33 , fluctuations in the parameters do not change this coordinate and the contribution of the @xmath4 direction to dipolar heating is zero  @xcite . on the other hand , as @xmath65 for a centered plug beam , the relative fluctuations of @xmath25 and @xmath21 do not induce dipolar heating along @xmath61 .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath15 do change @xmath76 because of a change in the angle @xmath30 , through @xmath77 .",
    "however , even for @xmath15 , the dominant contribution to dipolar heating is along the direction @xmath60 .    for a threshold at @xmath78nk@xmath79s@xmath80 , we find that the maximum power spectral density of relative fluctuations should be @xmath81db@xmath79hz@xmath80 , @xmath82db@xmath79hz@xmath80 , and @xmath83db@xmath79hz@xmath80 for @xmath15 , @xmath25 , and @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "all three directions have to be taken into account . if the noise spectrum at frequencies @xmath84 ( @xmath73 ) is the same as the one given above at @xmath71 , the parametric heating rate due to the fluctuations in the three parameters remains very small , @xmath85s@xmath80 .",
    "parametric heating should thus not be the dominant heating mechanism in the trap .",
    "finally , we discuss the sensitivity of the trap to the beam pointing stability .",
    "when the plug beam is focused exactly in the center of the magnetic trap , the two minima are symmetrically placed with respect to the @xmath86 plane and present the same trap depth .",
    "however , small displacements in the plug position of the order of a few micrometers unbalance the depths and consequently the populations of the trap minima .",
    "they also modify the positions of the minima and the oscillation frequencies inside them . for large displacements ,",
    "one of the minima can even disappear .",
    "we first remark that the symmetry with respect to the @xmath5 plane is still preserved with an off - centered beam , which implies that the trap minima always satisfy @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the expression of the oscillation frequency @xmath56 as a function of the gradient @xmath15 and the magnetic field @xmath49 at the trap minimum still holds . for displacements small as compared to @xmath21 , we can estimate the shift induced on the position of the minimum in the @xmath5 plane and on the oscillation frequencies .",

    "the eigenaxes , given by the angle @xmath30 , can thus be significantly tilted for @xmath93 .",
    "the deviation @xmath94 of the eigenaxes depends more on @xmath95 than on @xmath89 , and reads : @xmath96    the dependence of the oscillation frequencies on the plug position is also calculated analytically at first order .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the highest frequency @xmath58 does not depend on the plug position at first order in @xmath89 , @xmath95 .",
    "this makes this frequency particularly stable .",
    "the frequency @xmath97 depends only on @xmath89 , as does @xmath50 .",

    ".    we can evaluate the dipolar and parametric heating rates from this analysis .",
    "we find again that dipolar excitation dominates .",

    "the heating of the gas can be intuitively understood as an anti - evaporation process : the coldest atoms of the gas are indeed the closest to the quadrupole magnetic field zero and thus more likely to undergo a spin flip .    in order to check the validity of this model and determine the value of @xmath108 for our setup , we performed the following experiment : after evaporatively cooling the atomic cloud down to @xmath118k in a bare quadrupole trap with @xmath119  g@xmath79cm@xmath80 , corresponding to the maximal value of the magnetic gradient in our setup , we decompress the trap in 50  ms to a final value of the magnetic gradient @xmath121 and keep the cloud in the trap for various holding times .",

    "the beam position determines the magnetic field @xmath49 at the bottom of the trap , the oscillation frequencies , and the population ratio between the two potential minima on both sides of the laser . in this section",
    ", we give a series of measurements that allow a full characterization of the trap parameters , and compare them to calculations of the potential .",
    "first , we recall that the oscillation frequency @xmath56 , given by the expression , depends only on the magnetic gradient @xmath15 and the magnetic field at the trap bottom @xmath49 .",
    "the gradient @xmath15 is known by both a calibration of the quadrupole coils with a hall probe and a direct measurement with a cold cloud ; see appendix  [ sec : overview ] .",
    "a measurement of @xmath49 would thus allow a prediction of the frequency @xmath56 .",
    "the frequency @xmath168 corresponds to the rf frequency at which all the atoms are evaporated from the trap .",
    "@xmath49 can thus be estimated directly from the evaporation procedure .",
    "however , the rf amplitude used for evaporative cooling is large enough to ensure an adiabatic deformation of the magnetic level , and thus shifts the bottom frequency . to get a precise value of the rf frequency at the bottom of the trap , we perform radio - frequency spectroscopy of trapped condensates .",
    "we use an additional radio - frequency field linearly polarized along the @xmath4 axis to resonantly probe the trapped atoms .",
    "this induces spin flips between the @xmath103 , @xmath104 trapped state and the @xmath103 , @xmath169 state in which the atoms are pushed away by the combination of the plug potential and gravity .",
    "we extract from the spectroscopy data the resonant rf field at the trap bottom .",
    "we calibrate the rf probe by monitoring the atom number decay for small rf amplitudes at resonance .",
    "the decay rate is found to scale quadratically with the rf rabi frequency , as expected from a fermi golden rule estimation .",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to compute the decay rate as a function of the trap parameters .",
    "although the purely magnetic trap used in ref .",
    "@xcite is completely different from ours , the trap shape presents similarities .",
    "indeed , in ref  @xcite , the vertical trapping frequency is so small that the entire atomic cloud is displaced by the gravitational field to a region where the atoms experience a magnetic field gradient .",

    "@xcite is still valid in our setup , even if the predicted spectrum width is more complicated to estimate , given the tilt of the eigenaxes .",

    "the uncertainty on @xmath176 mainly comes from the uncertainty on the magnetic gradient ; see table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "the most straightforward method of reliably measuring the oscillation frequencies of a harmonic trap consists in exciting dipolar and/or parametric oscillations of the trapped cloud . in the case of an optically plugged trap",
    "this can be achieved by modulating the current @xmath177 in the coils which produce the magnetic quadrupole . in this way , both the cloud position and the trap frequencies are modulated  @xcite .    in our experiment",

    "the experimental setup can be decomposed into three main parts as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "a first vacuum chamber is filled with a hot vapor of @xmath0rb atoms heated in an oven to @xmath215c .",
    "this sets the @xmath0rb partial pressure to @xmath216 mbar .",
    "the atoms are collected by a bi - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( 2d mot )  @xcite .",
    "an additional laser beam pushes the atoms into a second vacuum chamber where they are captured by a three - dimensional magneto - optical trap ( 3d mot ) .",
    "we typically load about @xmath217 atoms in the 3d mot in 5s , these numbers being mostly sensitive to the power and direction of the pushing laser beam .",
    "thanks to a differential pumping tube the partial pressure in the 3d mot chamber can be kept of the order of @xmath218 mbar , as deduced from the 3d mot lifetime of 30s  @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of our setup comes from the water - cooled 3d mot quadrupole magnetic field coils which are held on a motorized translation stage that can be displaced at will along the @xmath34  axis  @xcite . after the transfer of the atoms from the 3d mot into a quadrupole magnetic trap made with the same coils",
    ", the translation stage is moved along a 28.5 cm path , bringing in turn a fraction of the atoms into a @xmath219mm@xmath220 inner - size science glass cell ( starna ) with very good optical access .",
    "the cell walls have a width of 1.25 mm and are anti - reflection coated on their external sides at 532 nm and between 650 and 1100 nm . during the transport in the moving trap ,",
    "the atoms pass through a 4-mm - diameter , 94-mm - long tube , which ensures an ultrahigh - vacuum environment in the final chamber .",
    "the atoms are finally transferred into a second quadrupole magnetic trap induced by a pair of water - cooled conical coils made of @xmath221 loops of hollow copper tubes each . there",
    "the loss rate @xmath112 due to collisions with the background gas corresponds to a lifetime @xmath222s .",
    "the calibration of the magnetic gradient is done directly with an ultracold cloud , in the following way .",
    "the magnetic field is suddenly switched off for a short duration , such that the atomic cloud starts to fall in the gravitational field .",
    "it is then switched on again , and the atoms oscillate along the @xmath11 vertical fiber axis in both the quadrupole and gravitational fields .",
    "the two gradients add when the cloud is above the magnetic zero and subtract below . from a parabolic fit to the data and the knowledge of @xmath10 , we infer a calibration of the imaging system and the value of the magnetic gradient .        for cooling and pushing rb atoms in the 2d and 3d mots , we built an agile and powerful 780 nm laser source relying on frequency doubling of an amplified telecom laser  @xcite .",
    "a fiber - pigtailed , 2mw , distributed - feedback laser diode ( fitel ) emitting at 1560 nm feeds a 40-db erbium doped fiber amplifier ( keopsys ) , with a maximum output power of 10w .",
    "the second harmonic is generated in a @xmath223mm@xmath195 periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) crystal ( hc photonics ) .",
    "the quasi - phase matching condition is met by regulating the temperature of the crystal at @xmath224c with a home - made oven .",
    "the 1560 nm beam has a 70@xmath147 m waist to maximize the doubling efficiency according to the boyd - kleinman model  @xcite . in single pass ,",
    "we obtain a maximum of 2w of linearly polarized light at 780 nm in a tem00 mode .",
    "the frequency control of the doubled laser is made by beat note locking with a reference laser .",
    "this reference laser is a 780 nm , 70mw , narrow linewidth external cavity laser ( radiantdye ) locked by the saturated absorption technique .",
    "its free linewidth has been measured to @xmath225khz and its linewidth when locked has been estimated at around @xmath226khz . the beat note between the reference laser and the doubled laser is frequency locked to an rf signal of adjustable frequency around 270mhz .    by tuning the beat - note frequency",
    "we are able to sweep the doubled laser frequency over a large span from @xmath227 to @xmath228 around the @xmath229 cycling transition of the @xmath0rb @xmath230 line , where @xmath231 is the transition linewidth , without altering the output intensity . the intensity is independently controlled or switched off by an acousto - optic modulator .",
    "the doubled light is then split into four beams injected into polarization maintaining fibers .",
    "two transverse cooling beams and a weak pushing beam , with a total power of 120mw , seed the 2d mot .",
    "the last one is used for the 3d mot and is coupled to one of the two input ports of a @xmath232 fiber cluster ( schfter+kirchhoff ) .    at the cluster output ,",
    "each of the six fibers is connected to a compact three - lense collimator system ( syrte labs design ) .",
    "the collimated beams are clipped to a diameter of 1 in . by a quarter - wave plate directly set at the collimator output to produce the required circularly polarized light .",
    "the total intensity of the six cooling beams is 41mw@xmath79@xmath233 .",
    "the repumper laser is a 70mw sanyo laser diode , frequency locked to the @xmath234 transition of the @xmath230 line .",
    "it is superimposed onto the 2d mot transverse beams before their injection into the fibers , while it is mixed with the 3d mot beams through the second input of the fiber cluster .",
    "the repumper laser is not present in the pushing beam , which limits the 2d mot atomic beam velocity and improves the recapture efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the plug beam originates from a high - power diode - pumped laser at 532 nm ( spectra physics millennia x ) with an output power reaching 10w in a tem@xmath235 spatial mode . to control the laser intensity and allow for the fast switching of the beam",
    ", we use an acoustic - optic modulator with a center frequency of 110mhz . at the position of the atoms , the optical plug power is about 6w for a waist of @xmath236 m .",
    "the beam position is controlled by two piezoelectric actuators on a mirror mount .    the power spectrum density of intensity fluctuations of the laser beam amounts to @xmath237db@xmath79hz@xmath80 at the trap frequencies , which corresponds to a calculated heating rate of about 1nk@xmath79s@xmath80 ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] . using a quadrant photodiode",
    ", we characterized the pointing stability of the plug beam .",
    "the long - term beam pointing stability is rather good , with a drift below @xmath167 m over 1 week .",
    "we also recorded the power spectrum of beam pointing fluctuations .",
    "we find @xmath238db@xmath100m@xmath239hz@xmath80 over the trap frequency range .",
    "this value agrees with a measured heating rate of 80nk@xmath79s@xmath80 in the optically plugged quadrupole trap .",
    "this figure could be improved if necessary by actively locking the plug position to a reference measured with the quadrant photodiode .",
    "finally , the waist fluctuations typically take place at very low frequencies , linked to thermal effects in the laser cavity .",
    "we did not quantify this level , but we expect an extremely low value at the trap frequencies , with negligible contribution to the heating rate .      before the transfer of the atoms from the 3d mot to the quadrupole magnetic trap , the 3d mot is first compressed by progressively increasing the magnetic field gradient from 9.5 to 45g@xmath79cm@xmath80 and increasing the 3d mot laser beams detuning from @xmath240 to @xmath241 .",
    "the laser beams are then turned off and the magnetic field axial gradient is linearly increased from 45 to 200g@xmath79cm@xmath80 in 250ms , allowing the capture in the magnetic field quadrupole trap of about @xmath242 atoms in the @xmath243 state .",
    "the displacement of the quadrupole trap from the 3d mot chamber to the science glass cell relies on a motorized translation stage ( parker 404-xr ) whose maximal velocity , acceleration , and jerk are controlled by built - in software . during the first half of the transportation the maximal acceleration of the translation stage is set to 0.8m@xmath79s@xmath244 and its jerk to 50m@xmath79s@xmath245 .",
    "it hence reaches a maximal velocity of 1m.s@xmath80 .",
    "the second half of the transfer corresponds to the mirrored image of the first half .",
    "finally the transfer efficiency is about @xmath246 and is mostly limited by the free evaporation of the hottest atoms against the walls of the small tube during the displacement of the translation stage .",
    "as soon as the atoms have reached the science glass cell , the current in the transfer magnetic field coils is ramped down to zero while the current in the conical magnetic field coils is ramped up from zero in order to keep the magnetic field gradients constant .",
    "up to @xmath247 atoms with a temperature of @xmath248k are loaded in the final magnetic field quadrupole trap .",
    "the current is provided by a delta elektronika power supply , which has a low relative current noise , @xmath249db@xmath79hz@xmath80 at most , and the associated dipolar heating is negligible . in order to increase the collision rate ,",
    "the axial magnetic field gradient is finally adiabatically ramped up to 432g@xmath79cm@xmath80 , the radial gradient thus being @xmath119g@xmath79cm@xmath80 . in this trap",
    "the atom lifetime is larger than 120s at the initial temperature of @xmath250k .",
    "the plug is then switched on and the rf - induced evaporation starts .",
    "the plug alignment proceeds as follows .",
    "we first leave the plug on during the time of flight and absorption imaging which allows us to image the plug as a depression in the expanding gas density profile . in this way , we are able to roughly match the plug position to the magnetic trap center ( known from _ in situ _ absorption imaging ) .",
    "then , at lower temperatures ( typically at 20@xmath251k ) , the plug position is optimized to obtain a symmetric expansion of the cloud due to initial acceleration induced by the plug during the time of flight .",
    "once this optimization is done , we proceed with the evaporation sequence and the adiabatic trap opening discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : evaporation ] .",
    "finally we switch off the plug and the magnetic trap simultaneously and optimize the plug position on the peak density after a given time of flight .",
    "we repeat this for lower and lower rf frequencies , until the expanded cloud density p rofile starts to deviates from a pure gaussian . at this point",
    "bec is observed on further lowering of the rf frequency .",
    "eventually we finely tune the plug position to place the bec on a given magnetic isopotential .",
    "both the rf field applied for evaporation and the probing rf field are linearly polarized along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the evaporation field is generated by the rear panel output of a direct digital synthesizer ( dds ) ( taborelec ww1072 ) , going through a @xmath252w amplifier ( kalmus ) and roughly impedance matched to a 10-mm - radius 20-loop coil , to avoid any unwanted resonance in this frequency range .",
    "the overall circuit length , including rf switches , is much smaller than the shortest wavelength to avoid high - frequency resonances .",
    "the frequency is ramped from 50 down to 4mhz with a piece - wise linear time dependence , in order to keep efficient evaporation dynamics in 13.5s .",
    "at this point we have about @xmath253 atoms at @xmath166k .",
    "the trap is then adiabatically opened to a 55.4g@xmath79cm@xmath80 gradient in 50ms , which results in a cloud temperature of @xmath151k .",
    "after the trap opening , the evaporation is carried on with a second antenna ( 30 mm radius , 20 loop coil , about 30 mm away from the trap center ) , producing a rf field linearly polarized along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "this antenna is fed directly by a stanford ds345 function generator , producing a logarithmic ramp from 2mhz to 300khz in 5s .",
    "the probe antenna for radio - frequency probing the condensate is a 30-mm - radius 20-loop coil , directly fed by another stanford ds345 .",
    "we use absorption imaging to measure the density distribution of the atoms once released from the optically plugged quadrupole trap .",
    "the probe beam is derived directly from the reference laser , its waist at the atoms position is @xmath254 mm for a total power of @xmath255w .",
