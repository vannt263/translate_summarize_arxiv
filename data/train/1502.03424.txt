    "the environment objectively encodes pointer - state information for any quantum systems embedded in it in a way that is both uniform and massively redundant , making this information equally accessible to the many mutually non - interacting observers , each of whom can obtain the encoded information without disrupting either the systems themselves or the encodings accessed by other observers .",
    "other than that they each interact only with their own local fragment of the environment , no physical restrictions are placed on the observers in this picture ; in particular , they are not restricted in either their location with respect to the observed systems or the resolution with which they interact with the environment .",
    "the resolution with which the environment encodes pointer - state information about any particular system depends only on the system - environment interaction and does not , in particular , depend in any way on any of the observer - environment interactions .",
    "decoherence is routinely ( e.g. @xcite among others ) but by no means universally ( e.g. @xcite ) invoked in cosmological settings to explain both unidirectional time evolution and apparently classical values for degrees of freedom such as center - of - mass positions or velocities .",
    "however , the question of how decoherence makes the _ same _ information about center - of - mass positions , velocities or any other effectively classical degrees of freedom available to multiple , independent observers  the question of encoding redundancy raised by quantum darwinism  has yet to be addressed explicitly . the fact that human observers currently obtain all information about center - of - mass positions , velocities and other properties of objects of cosmological interest through interactions with the ambient photon field is consistent with both primary assumptions of quantum darwinism : that pointer - state information is redundantly encoded by states of the same environment that is responsible for decoherence and that observers obtain such information solely by interacting with local fragments of the decohering environment .",
    "we assume , therefore , that the ambient photon field is the environment @xmath31 responsible for decoherence throughout the human - observable universe @xmath34 from the photon decoupling time if not earlier , and that the ambient photon field encodes the decohered center - of - mass positions , velocities and other observable properties of objects of cosmological interest with sufficient redundancy to allow their detection by multiple observers .",
    "two epochs of decoherence by the ambient photon field can be distinguished : an initial epoch in which the matter in @xmath34 consists solely of populations of identical particles , and a second , later epoch in which at least some matter is gravitationally bound into distinct , individually - identifiable , effectively - classical macroscopic systems such as stars . in the former epoch , global states of the universe are symmetric under swaps of one particle for another within a single population , e.g. swaps of one electron for another electron or of one h atom for another h atom . during this epoch of swap - symmetric global states ,",
    "the ambient photon field encodes information about the instantaneous spatial distribution of particles within each population , but no information about which particular particle , e.g. each particular electron or h atom , occupies which position . in the latter epoch ,",
    "this swap symmetry is broken ; indeed `` classicality '' can be defined by the twin requirements of unidirectional time evolution and the presence of distinct , non - swappable `` objects '' that maintain their individual identities through time while changing their states . during this second epoch ,",
    "the ambient photon field encodes information not only about the instantaneous spatial distribution of systems , but also about which particular system occupies which position .",
    "this non - swap - symmetric epoch can be taken to have begun at least by the time of earliest star formation , and it continues to the present .",
    "it is only in this epoch that comparisons between records kept by different observers are possible  observers and recordings are distinct entities and hence are not swap - symmetric  and hence only here that the encoding redundancy required by quantum darwinism is relevant .",
    "quantum darwinism is concerned only with pointer - state encodings that are sufficiently redundant that any observer can access the encoded information by interacting with a local fragment of the environment . while many encodings may be redundant over small scales , e.g. redundant for human observers on earth , encodings of cosmological interest",
    "must be redundant over cosmological scales .",
    "for the present purposes , we regard an encoding of pointer - state information in the ambient photon field of @xmath34 as `` sufficiently redundant '' to be of cosmological interest if any observer @xmath35 located anywhere within @xmath34 can access the encoded information by interacting with a local fragment of the ambient photon field of her own observable universe @xmath36 .",

    "systems with center - of - mass position encodings that are sufficiently redundant in this sense are considered to be systems or `` objects '' of cosmological interest .",
    "informally , this requirement of a sufficiently redundant center - of - mass position encoding corresponds to the requirement that systems of cosmological interest have `` ontic '' or `` objective '' center - of - mass positions that are independent of the locations of or spatial coordinate systems used by observers anywhere within our observable universe .",
