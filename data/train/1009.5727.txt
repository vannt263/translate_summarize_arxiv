    "inflation ( for the general review , @xcite ) is perhaps the most popular model for the very early universe .",
    "it solves many problems of the hot big bang model and could provide the seeds of structure formation from quantum fluctuations in an inflating background .",
    "however , a big question for inflation is what is the inflaton field and how does it connect to particle physics . without knowing this",
    ", we do not even know how to reheat the universe , hence recover the conventional hot big bang .    among the many inflation models , chaotic inflation may be the most successful model for dealing with the initial condition of inflation .",
    "inflation started immediately from planck scale when the baby universe was created from quantum gravity .",
    "there is no need for a thermal equilibrium state before inflation in order to start inflation from phase transition .",
    "in addition , chaotic inflation predict a self reproducing process of the universe ( or multiverse ) which is called eternal inflation . it is almost becoming a common sense that we can not have a model of inflation in the framework of standard model ( sm ) and we have to go beyond it .",
    "the most popular approach may be supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "chaotic inflation can be builded in susy by using right - handed sneutrino as the inflaton @xcite .",
    "however currently the real experimental evidences that we should go beyond the standard model is from neutrino oscillation which strongly indicates that neutrino has a small mass . in order to explain neutrino mass ,",
    "seesaw mechanism is introduced .",
    "there are basically three types of seesaw mechanism . in type ii",
    "seesaw , a higgs triplet is introduced .",
    "the triplet scalar field can be implemented naturally in several contexts of physics beyond the sm .",
    "for example , in the left - right symmetry electroweak theory  @xcite the gauge symmetry @xmath0 breaks to the sm symmetry due to a right - triplet @xmath1 .",
    "in @xmath2 grand unified theory a triplet scalar consisted in the fundamental representation * 5 * which breaks the sm to @xmath3 .",
    "the minimal littlest higgs model  @xcite in which the triplet higgs scalar arises from the breaking of global @xmath2 down to @xmath4 symmetry as one of the goldstone bosones . in this paper",
    ", we show that higgs triplet can play the role of inflaton for chaotic inflation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] , we discuss type ii seesaw and the constraints relevant to our model . in section",
    "[ 3 ] , we present the inflation model by using higgs triplet as the inflaton . in section [ 4 ] , we discuss leptogenesis happens after inflation .",
    "section [ 5 ] is our conclusion .",
    "the type ii seesaw mechanism enlarges the higgs sector [ @xmath5 of the standard model with an isospin triplet , @xmath6 , of complex @xmath7 scalar fields with hypercharge @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "a majorana mass for the observed neutrinos can be generated by a gauge - invariant yukawa interaction of the left - handed lepton doublets with the scalar @xmath6 without the introduction of the heavy right - handed neutrinos , the yukawa reads @xmath9 where the yukawa couplings @xmath10 is a @xmath11 symmetric complex matrix , @xmath12 is the left - handed lepton doublet with flavor index @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the charge conjugation operator , and @xmath15 is the pauli matrix . the matrix representation of the triplet can be written as @xmath16 and the most general scalar potential is given by @xmath17 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda_{3}tr(\\delta^{\\dag}\\delta)^2 + \\lambda_{4}h^{\\dag}\\delta\\delta^{\\dag}h \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( \\mu h^{t}i\\tau_{2}\\delta^{\\dag}h + { \\rm h.c.}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 to ensure the spontaneous breaking pattern of the sm via @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the mass term of the triplet scalars . in the limit of @xmath21 the symmetry of the model is enhanced , which leads to spontaneous violation of lepton number for @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting massless scalar ( so - called majoron , j ) will contribute to the invisible width of @xmath23 boson , and it is phenomenologically unacceptable as was excluded at lep .",
    "hence the simultaneous presence of the yukawa interaction in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) and the trilinear term @xmath24 with dimensionful parameter @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) will explicitly break lepton number and eliminate the majoron .",
    "the @xmath25-term may arise from the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar singlet field  @xcite or in the scenario of extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "therefore the breaking of lepton number associated is communicated to the lepton sector through the vev of the triplet scalar @xmath26 .",
    "one expects that the majorana mass term of neutrinos will be proportional to @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we consider a heavy triplet scalar , @xmath28 , so we will neglect the contributions from the terms involving @xmath29 .",
    "the value of the triplet vev , @xmath30 can be calculated from the minimum condition of the potential @xmath31 , the results are @xmath32 the neutrino mass matrix can be generated via the eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) @xmath33 which can be realized the seesaw structure if we take @xmath34 .",
    "the upper bound on the triplet vev @xmath30 can be obtained from the effect on @xmath35-parameter ( @xmath36 )  @xcite , @xmath37 which is predicted to be @xmath38 in the sm .",
    "the experimental limit  @xcite leads to @xmath39 gev . on the other hand , the present absolute neutrino masses are constrained through the electron energy spectrum from the end - point in the nuclear beta decays ( i.e. the tritium decay , @xmath40 ev )  @xcite and the cosmological observations , @xmath41 ev ( 95% cl )  @xcite . as a result",
    "we have a lower bound of @xmath42 ev if we take the perturbative criterion for yukawa coupling @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ numass ] ) .",
    "consequently we obtain the range by using eq .",
    "( [ minimum ] ) @xmath44 in the limit of @xmath34 and @xmath45 gev the mass of triplet scalar is bounded in the range of @xmath46",
    "we assume the expectation value of @xmath6 plays the role of the inflaton field @xmath47 with @xmath48 during inflation .",
    "the potential energy of @xmath47 can be read off from eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) as @xmath49 due the the large expectation value of @xmath47 during inflation , the effective mass of @xmath50 becomes very large from the last term in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "therefore the expectation value of @xmath50 is driven to zero and we can neglect the last term in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the quartic term is assumed to be negligible and we will consider its possible role later . hence during inflation we have @xmath51 this potential is ideal for chaotic inflation .",

    "the situation is similar to sneutrino inflation @xcite , but no susy is required in our setup .",
    "the spectral index @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 the tensor to scalar ratio is @xmath62 this may be detectable from analysis of b - mode polarization of cmb data from planck satellite @xcite , the ground - based detectors quiet+polarbear @xcite , or kek s future cmb satellite experiment , litebird @xcite .    for the last term in eq .",
    "( [ inflation ] ) to be negligible at @xmath55 , we need to have @xmath63 . for the case @xmath64 , we can actually have a successful chaotic inflation driven by the quartic term . in this case",
    ", @xmath65 can be smaller than @xmath66 gev",
    ". however , chaotic inflation driven by a quartic term is on the verge of being ruled out @xcite .",
    "there are several channels that the inflaton @xmath47 can decay into , such as @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , with the decay widths given by @xmath69 here we neglect the mixings between @xmath50 and @xmath70 . for estimate",
    ", we may assume the total decay rate of the inflaton is @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the reheating temperature @xmath72 is @xmath73 for an inflation model based on susy , this value may be too high to cause gravitino problem .",
    "however , since we do not impose susy , we do not have gravitino problem .",
    "now we discuss the baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis via the triplet scalar decay . in what follows",
    "we consider the decay final states of 2-lepton and 2-scalars . since the appearance of @xmath25-term in the potential ( eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) ) the lepton number is explicitly violated due to the coexistence of the decays @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "cp violation will occur if there are extra contributions to the neutrino masses , such as with additional heavy fermion singlets  @xcite or with another higgs triplets  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the later case and hence the scale of lepton number violation is the same as the mass of the triplet higgs scalars .",
    "we write down the terms which are relevant to the leptogenesis        @xmath76    the cp asymmetry @xmath77 is defined as @xmath78 with @xmath79 represents the processes violate lepton number by two units and @xmath80 is the thermally averaged decay width of @xmath81 .",
    "cp asymmetry arises in the interferece of the tree with the one - loop self - energy diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : leptogenesis ] and will induce the off - diagonal mass matrix corrections . here",
    "we assume @xmath82 , so we can identify @xmath83 as the inflaton @xmath47 in our scenario . due to the large expectation value of @xmath84 during inflation , the field value of @xmath85",
    "is driven to zero by a term @xmath86 , therefore it plays no role ( such as a curvaton or two - field inflation ) during inflation . after reheating",
    "when the temperature of the universe cooled down to below @xmath87 , most of @xmath83 would decay away .",
    "however , the lepton asymmetry will be erased by the thermal equilibrium processes via the interactions of @xmath81 .",
    "so the asymmetry of the universe can only be generated by the subsequent decay of @xmath81 at the temperature around @xmath88 . in order to have a successful leptogenesis , the @xmath25 terms in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) has to exist during the reheating process terms arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking of some scalar fields , those fields must already sit on their vevs .",
    "we assume this is the case .",

    "we can interpret the leptogenesis as well as cp violation are created from the triplet scalar @xmath81 `` oscillate '' into inflaton @xmath83 and decay .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the supersymmetric limit the masses of @xmath81 and @xmath83 are degenerate , then the soft supersymmetry breaking terms may provide the necessary mass splitting and cp violation for the resonant leptogenesis . however , in this case we may have to worry the gravitino problem as considering the reheating temperature produced after inflation is estimated to be roughly @xmath66 gev .",
    "one may worry about that quantum corrections may destroy the flatness of the scalar potential when @xmath123 , however since slow roll conditions ensure an approximate shift symmetry to the potential , the quantum corrections is logarithmic and negligible @xcite .",
