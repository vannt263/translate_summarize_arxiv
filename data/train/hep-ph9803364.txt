    "in this study , we wish to approach the theory of high energy collisions of heavy ions based on a minimal number of first principles instead of using the elaborate technique of factorization - based scattering theory @xcite .",
    "our ultimate goal is to provide a description of the transition process which converts two initial - state composite systems ( the stable nuclei in the `` normal '' nonperturbative vacuum ) into the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is a dense system of quarks and gluons with a perturbative vacuum as its ground state .",
    "this scenario was suggested by shuryak 20 years ago @xcite and it is our basic assumption that this phenomenon does indeed take place .",
    "our main result is that this dense system can be formed only _ in a single quantum transition_. this transition is similar to the process described by the evolution equations of deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) and differs from it only by the scale parameter inherent to the final state .",
    "the limit of resolution for the emission process in dis is connected with the minimal mass of a jet , while in the case of the qgp final - state , the scale is much smaller and defined by the screening properties of the qgp itself .    to pose this essentially quantum  mechanical problem properly ,",
    "one ( ideally ) needs an exact definition of two main elements : the initial state of the system and the observables in the expected final state .",
    "we know very little about the initial state , and thus must rely on the following phenomenological input only : the nuclei are stable bound states of qcd and therefore , their configuration is dominated by the stationary quark and gluon fields .",
    "the nuclei are well shaped objects ; the uncertainty of their boundaries does not exceed the typical yukawa interaction range . in the laboratory frame , both nuclei are lorentz contracted to a longitudinal size @xmath0 .",
    "the tail of the yukawa potential is contracted in the same proportion .",
    "the world lines of the nuclei are the two opposite generatrices of the light - cone that has its vertex at the interaction point .",
    "therefore , no interaction between the nuclei is possible before they overlap geometrically .",
    "the final state is defined more accurately .",
    "we believe that single - particle distributions of quarks and gluons at some early moment after the nuclei have intersected , describe it sufficiently .",
    "thus , we may rely on a reasonably well - defined quantum observable .",
    "the corresponding operator should count the number of final - state particles defined as the excitations above the perturbative vacuum . to develop the theory for this transition process we have to cope with a binding feature that the `` final '' state has to be defined at a finite time .",
    "this may look disturbing for readers well versed in scattering theory .",
    "is it possible to compute the quantum - mechanical average of the operator that counts the final - state particles without precise knowledge of the wave function of the initial state ?",
    "we prove that this is indeed possible , provided we have the data from a much simpler process , like _ e  p _ dis .",
    "moreover , we argue that this is possible even without constructing any model for the proton or colliding nuclei like , _",
    "e.g. _ , the parton model .",
    "such a possibility is provided solely by the inclusive character of the measurements in both cases .",
    "indeed , the measurement of one - particle distributions is as inclusive as the measurement of the distribution of the final - state electron in dis .",
    "the key to our proof and to the suggested algorithm is the principle of causality in the quantum - mechanical measurement which has two major aspects .",
    "first , any statement concerning the time ordering must be in manifest agreement with the light cone boundaries .",
    "this is always guaranteed in the theory based on the relativistic wave equations .",
    "second , the process of measurement physically interrupts the evolution of a quantum system , and any dynamical information about the quantum - mechanical evolution reveals itself only after the wave function is collapsed . in order to implement these principles in a practical design of a theory",
    ", one has to start with a space - time description of the measurement , _",
    "i.e. _ , the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics .    to give a flavor of how the method works practically ,",
    "let us start with a qualitative description of the inclusive _ e - p _ dis measurement ( for now , at the tree level without discussion of the effects of interference ) . in this experiment ,",
    "the only observable is the number of electrons with a given momentum in the final state . something _ in the past _ has to create the electromagnetic field that deflects the electron . _ before _ this field is created , the electromagnetic current , which is the source of this field , has to be formed .",
    "since the momentum transfer in the process is very high , the current has to be sufficiently localized .",
    "this localization requires , in its turn , that the electric charges which carry this current must be dynamically decoupled from the bulk of the proton _ before _ the scattering field is created ( to prevent a recoil to the other parts of the proton which could spread the emission domain ) .",
    "such a dynamical decoupling of a quark requires a proper rearrangement of the gluonic component of the proton with the creation of short - wave components of a gluon field . by causality",
    ", corresponding gluonic fluctuation must happen before the _ current _ has decoupled , _ etc .",
    "_ thus we arrive at the picture of the sequential - dynamical fluctuations which create an electromagnetic field probed by the electron .",
    "it is very important that the picture of the fluctuation is dynamical .",
    "the short - wave fourier components of the quark and gluon fields are more typical of free propagation with high momentum , than for a smooth static design of a stable proton .",
    "the lifetimes of these fluctuations are very short and they all _ coherently _ add up to form a stable proton , unless the interaction of measurement breaks the proper balance of phases .",
    "this intervention freezes some instantaneous picture of the fluctuations , but with wrong `` initial velocities '' which results in a new wave function , and collapse of the old one .",
    "an example of such a fluctuation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where the arrows point to the later moments of time .",
    "this qualitative picture has been described many times and with many variations in the literature , starting with the pioneering lecture by gribov @xcite , and including a recent textbook @xcite ; however , the sequential temporal ordering of the fluctuations has never been a key issue .",
    "we derive this ordering as a consequence of the heisenberg equations of motion for the observables .",
    "the ordering appears to be universal only _ at the born level_. in general , the interference effects break the sequential temporal ordering , unless the measurement prohibits the interference itself .",
    "we eventually arrive at a time - ordered picture which resembles the picture used by lepage and brodsky @xcite .",
    "the difference is that they applied time ordering exclusively in connection with the light - cone hamiltonian dynamics , while our picture holds in any dynamics as long as the expansion in terms of two - point correlators makes sense .",
    "qualitative arguments supporting the strong time ordering in fast hadrons were put forward earlier by gribov @xcite . for our practical goals ,",
    "such an ordering is significant for several reasons .",
    "first , it makes the whole picture of the evolution causal and clearly indicates that the inclusively measured fluctuations are independent of the nature of the inclusive probe .",
    "second , the causality allows one _ to prove _ important dispersion relations .",
    "these relations provide a tool for the renormalization which is also subjected to causality , _ viz .",
    "_ , there can not be radiative corrections to a stable proton ( or nucleus ) configuration .",
    "this condition is physical and fully equivalent to the on - mass - shell renormalization of the asymptotic states in a standard scattering theory .",
    "thus , we do not treat the intermediate quark and gluon fields as fundamental fields that have certain states . only hadrons ( in dis ) or collective modes ( in dense matter )",
    "can be the states of emission .",
    "third , the causality in the inclusive measurement requires that the quark and gluon fields , which might exist after the measurement , _ are fully developed _ as the virtual fluctuations _ before the measurement_. this is true both for freely - propagating hard quarks and gluons and for their final - state hadronic equivalents ( jets ) .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations have to satisfy the condition of emission .",
    "this condition requires that ( i ) the field of emission exists as a detectable state , and ( ii ) that two different states can be resolved .",
    "unlike qed , qcd has an intrinsic criterion of resolution which requires that the states of emission in the physical vacuum must be hadrons .",
    "e.g. _ , there can not be a quark or gluon emission which carries away an invariant mass @xmath1 less than several hadronic masses .",
    "in other words , the modes with wave - length @xmath2 can not propagate .",
    "the process of formation of the final - state jets has to be fully accomplished in a few @xmath3 .",
    "this general rule , however , must be changed if a quark or gluon becomes a part of a dense system , like the qgp , where the boundary of the soft ( and hopefully still perturbative ) dynamics is determined by a parameter similar to the plasmon mass ( or the debye screening length ) and not a hadronic scale @xcite",
    ". this condition selects fluctuations that are materialized as the qgp after the coherence of the nuclei is broken .",
    "fourth , our analysis , based on the causal picture of the evolution , indicates that the only scale that may appear in the theory is connected to the physical properties of the final states .",
    "this scale penetrates into the theory only in connection with the infra - red ( collinear ) problem but _ not _ in connection with ultra - violet renormalization .",
    "this observation allows one to outline the scenario of formation of the dense matter at the first 1_fm _ of a nuclear collision as follows : the nuclei probe each other locally at all scales which are consistent with the spectrum of the allowed final states .",
    "the most localized interactions create the final - state fields with the highest @xmath4 which are the least sensitive to the collective properties of the final state .",
    "( a similar process takes place in dis at sufficiently high @xmath5 . )",
    "these states are formed as ( quasi- ) particles by the time @xmath6 . in this domain ,",
    "the structure functions and their rates of evolution must be very similar for both nuclear collisions and dis .",
    "therefore , the dis data obtained with precise control of the momentum transfer may serve as an input for the calculation of the nuclei collision .",
    "the states with lower @xmath4 are formed at later times .",
    "this does not much affect the qcd evolution in dis , where the phase - space of the final states is almost unpopulated and only the shape of the jets may lead to the power corrections . in the case of nuclei collisions",
    "this is not true , as the low@xmath4 states are formed in a space which is already populated with the earlier formed ( virtually decoupled ) fast particles .",
    "these fast particles produce screening effects .",
    "the process of the formation of the new states saturates at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an effective mass of partons in the ( highly non - equilibrium ) collective system formed by the time @xmath9 . to quantify this scenario one has to derive evolution equations that respect specific properties of the final states in the qgp .",
    "a draft of such a derivation is given in the last two chapters of the paper .",
    "to conclude , the standard inclusive _ e - p _ dis delivers information about quantum fluctuations which may dynamically develop in the proton .",
    "we do not need to know the `` proton s wave function '' ( since the proton is a true fundamental mode of qcd , this notion is not even well defined ) .",
    "the theory can be built on two premises : causality , and the condition of emission .",
    "the latter is also known as the principle of cluster decomposition which must hold in any reasonable field theory . what the `` resolved clusters '' are is a very delicate question .",
    "these states should be defined with an explicit reference as to how they are detected .",
    "conventional detectors deal with hadrons and allow one to hypothesize about jets .",
    "qgp turns out to be a kind of collective detector for quarks and gluons .",
    "a vast search for a scale in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions has been undertaken by mclerran _",
    "_ this study started with the formulation of the _ model _ for a large nucleus as a system of valence quarks moving at the speed of light ( mclerran  venugopalan model @xcite ) .",
    "the original idea of this approach was that the scale is associated with the density of valence quarks , that is , with the parameters of the initial state of the nuclear collision .",
    "the model was gradually improved ( see @xcite , and references therein ) by the accounting for the radiative corrections with emphasis on the domain of small @xmath10 and a derivation of the bfkl equation , which is known to have no scale parameter .",
    "the idea that screening effects should be taken into account , even at the earliest moments of a collision of two nuclei has been articulated earlier and with different motivations by shuryak and xiong @xcite and by eskola , muller and x .-",
    "n . wang @xcite . in ref.@xcite , the cut - off mass ( expressed via the temperature )",
    "was introduced to screen the singularities of the cross - section of the purely gluonic process , @xmath11 , in the chemically non - equilibrated plasma , @xmath12 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the non - equilibrium debye screening was introduced in order to prevent the singular infrared behavior of the hard part of the factorized cross - section of the mini - jet production .",
    "the expression for the screening mass in @xcite is very similar to our equation ( [ eq : s1.14 ] ) .",
    "however , in all of these papers , the origin of the structure functions of the colliding nuclei is not discussed , and there still remains an uncertainty connected with the choice of the factorization scale .",
    "we go one step further and prove that the screening parameters of the collective system determine the collinear cut - off self - consistently ; these screening parameters are _ already in the evolution equations _ for the structure functions of individual nucleons ( and therefore , in the nuclear structure functions ) .",
    "the qcd evolution equations are the main focus of this study .",
    "historically , their development started along two qualitatively different lines which eventually merged into what is currently known as the dglap equations . despite their common name , there are still certain concerns whether the marriage is happy .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between the dgl @xcite and the ap @xcite equations is evident only at the born level ( without the virtual radiative corrections ) .",
    "a discussion of what happens in the higher orders and particularly , what the argument of the running coupling is , still continues ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "the variations appear due to _ ab initio _ different approaches .",
    "while the ap equations re - interpret the equations of the operator product expansion ( ope ) based on the factorization and the renormalization group ( rg ) for _ e - p _ dis , the dgl equations are derived as a probabilistic picture of the multiple process .",
    "the ap equations just _ accept _ the running coupling of the rg for the exclusive feynman amplitudes , while in the dgl scheme one has to calculate the radiative corrections as constituents of a real process explicitly and assemble them into an effective quantity ( the running coupling ) .",
    "the first claim about a closer correspondence between the dgl and the ap equations , at least in one loop beyond the born approximation , was made in ref .",
    "@xcite ( widely known as ddt ) almost 20 years ago .",
    "the ultimate goal was to recover the running coupling in the natural environment of the qcd evolution ladder by collecting various radiative corrections into an effective form - factor instead of relying ( as does the ope method ) on the rg for the feynman amplitudes of the s - matrix scattering theory .",
    "this program was a success only for one subgroup of ladder diagrams , _ vis .",
    "_ , when the gluon is an offspring of the fermion line and the dynamics is driven solely by the splitting kernel @xmath13 .",
    "this was a smart choice , and success was almost predetermined by the well known fact that in physical gauges the renormalization of the coupling is fully defined by the gluon propagator . nevertheless , the ddt study did mighty battle with the double - logarithmic terms which naturally appear in radiative corrections .",
    "it was a formidable task to show that the running coupling depends on the highest transverse momentum in the splitting point .",
    "neither ddt , nor anybody else since that time , attempted to do the same for other types of splittings , though it is not obvious if the same result can be obtained for the coupling constant which accompanies the kernel @xmath14 ( when a single gluon line carries the lowest of three transverse momenta ) .",
    "we intend to bridge this gap and assemble the running coupling constant of all other kernels .",
    "the kernel @xmath15 ( when all three lines are gluons ) is of extreme interest since one may expect competition between three gluon self - energies with all different momenta .",
    "the case of pure glue - dynamics provides an ultimate test for the understanding of the dynamics of qcd evolution .",
    "we address it first , and use it later as a touchstone for all the tools we design .    for the sake of completeness , we begin in sec .  [ sec : sne ] with the basics of the so - called keldysh - schwinger technique  @xcite , in the form adjusted for the calculations of the inclusive observables  @xcite .",
    "the net yield of this section is summarized in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q1.33 ] ) for the fixed - order two - point field correlators .",
    "this equation shows that the correlator @xmath16 has two contributions : from the initial data , @xmath17 , and the source , @xmath18 , acting at an _ earlier _ time . in sec .  [",
    "sbsec : sbe3 ] we discuss the connection between eq .",
    "( [ eq : q1.33 ] ) and the spectral representation of field correlators and explain why the initial data can be dropped . in sec .",
    "[ sec : snto ] these equations are used to derive the equations that lead to the picture in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] and prove that the photon of _ e - p _ dis must be treated as part of the proton .",
    "we also examine ( in sec .  [",
    "sec : snto ] ) what types of fluctuation are active in the _ e - p _ dis which is inclusive with respect to a quark jet ( without observation of the final - state electron ) . in this problem",
    ", the photon `` belongs '' to the initial - state electron and the measurement is affected both by qed and qcd fluctuations which may develop in the initial - state electron .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : sne1 ] we derive the evolution equations of glue - dynamics yet without the radiative corrections .",
    "even at this level , we discover the second _ independent _ element of the evolution , _ vis .",
    "_ , the longitudinal fields , which are absent both in the dgl and the ap equations .",
    "the reason is that , in our derivation , the evolution equation naturally appear in a tensor form ( [ eq : e1.3 ] ) .",
    "projecting this equation onto the normal modes we obtain _ two _ interconnected evolution equations , ( [ eq : e1.10 ] ) and ( [ eq : e1.11 ] ) , for the transverse and longitudinal ( static , non - propagating ) gluon modes .",
    "this should not be considered a surprise .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the photon on the top of the evolution ladder ( just proved to be a part of the proton ) has transverse and longitudinal polarizations which are probed by the structure functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "it is not clear , _ a priori _ , why the gluon field should be only transverse . if the longitudinal field is eliminated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e1.10 ] ) and ( [ eq : e1.11 ] ) by a fiat , the remaining single equation is exactly the dglap evolution equation of glue - dynamics .",
    "its kernel is singular , and it is common to regulate it with the aid of the @xmath21-prescription . in ref.@xcite",
    "this prescription which incorporated self - energy corrections ( in the fixed coupling approximation ) was derived . for a similar singularity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1.11 ] ) this method does not work .",
    "moreover , it is not clear what kind of coupling accompanies the transition between the longitudinal and transverse fields in the evolution equations .",
    "potential consequence of this new - type of infrared divergence might be a disaster since the standard remedies of scattering theory are not designed to handle any problems related to the longitudinal fields . in scattering theory the latter are never treated as observables .",
    "the specifics of heavy - ion collisions are different because the observables must be defined at a finite time of evolution .",
    "unlike scattering theory , the longitudinal fields can not be absorbed into the definition of the final states . before looking for a cure",
    ", we must make sure that this is not a false alarm , _",
    "e.g. _ perhaps the infrared divergences do not cancel between the different rungs of the emission ladder .",
    "thus , we need to study the full set of radiative corrections in the order @xmath22 .",
    "a full set of radiative corrections includes different types of diagrams .",
    "two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] are virtual vertex corrections .",
    "their vertex loops are formed by three @xmath23-ordered propagators , @xmath24 , in @xmath25 ( diagram ( a ) ) and three @xmath26-ordered propagators , @xmath27 , in @xmath28 ( diagram ( b ) ) . even though all propagators which are connected to these vertices are retarded , the vertex loops have _ a priori _ arbitrary ordering of their space - time arguments .",
    "this may hurt the nice causal picture of the lowest order approximation .",
    "our main observation is that the net yield of the sum of these two diagrams does not change if the vertex @xmath25 is replaced by the retarded vertex @xmath29 ( diagram ( c ) ) and the vertex @xmath28 is replaced by the advanced vertex @xmath30 ( diagram ( d ) ) . in this formulation ,",
    "the picture of the evolution remains totally causal even in the order @xmath22 .",
    "the retarded properties of the new vertex functions in coordinate space can be translated into the analytic properties in momentum space . to comply with the light - cone dynamics and the light - cone gauge @xmath31",
    ", we must treat the coordinate @xmath32 as the temporal variable .",
    "the conjugated variable is the light - cone energy @xmath33 .",
    "we prove that the vertex function @xmath34 is analytic in the upper half - plane of complex @xmath33 .",
    "the light - cone energy @xmath33 corresponds to the latest momentum @xmath35 resolved in the course of the evolution ( which has the lowest component @xmath36 of the light - cone momentum and is , in fact , probed in the inclusive measurement ) .",
    "these results are obtained in sec .",
    "[ sbsec : sbe2b ] and appendix  1 . knowing the analytical properties of the vertex function we are able to prove the dispersion relations which allow one to find the real part of the vertex via its imaginary part .",
    "it occurs that all singularities which may affect the final answer are collinear and already appear in the calculation of the imaginary part which is connected with real processes .",
    "thus , these singularities are physical and do not change in the course of a calculation of the dispersion integrals . besides",
    ", they are always connected with emission into the final states and never with the absorption from the initial states .",
    "the dispersive method provides a tool for the uv - renormalization of the vertex function , _ viz .",
    "_ , the subtractions in dispersion relations .",
    "these subtractions must be made at a value @xmath37 of the light - cone energy in the domain were the imaginary part is zero .",
    "this domain occurs to be limited to a finite segment ( [ eq : e2.28 ] ) of the real axis in the complex plane of @xmath33 .",
    "the position @xmath38 of the subtraction point can be transformed into the value of @xmath39 ,  _ vis .",
    "_ , @xmath40 . under the assumption of strong ordering of the transverse momenta , @xmath41",
    ", the allowed values of @xmath42 are @xmath43 .",
    "even though this limitation is a direct consequence of causality , it may seem abnormal from the rg point of view .",
    "indeed , we can not take an asymptotically high renormalization point in @xmath39 .",
    "however , in a causal picture of gradually increasing resolution along the line of evolution , this limitation is absolutely natural .",
    "_ it is illegal to renormalize what is not yet resolved ! _",
    "if we proceed with renormalization at an arbitrary scale @xmath42 , then the calculation of the vertex function leads to the terms @xmath44 along with @xmath45 .",
    "the double - logarithms find no counterparts among either virtual loops or real emission processes .",
    "therefore , we immediately undermine the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) in which the dglap equations are derived ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : e3.6 ] ) ) . besides",
    ", in order to have @xmath46 one should choose a very low renormalization scale @xmath42 which would contradict all beliefs about perturbative qcd .",
    "these problems compel us to look for a physically - motivated condition for the renormalization .",
    "surprisingly , this condition is readily found at the opposite end of the allowed interval .",
    "if we take @xmath47 which corresponds to the subtraction point at @xmath48 , then all of the above problems miraculously disappear .",
    "the vertex function , as well as all retarded self - energies ( also calculated via dispersion relations ) , become free of logarithms , @xmath49 , which originate from ultraviolet renormalization ( where they are most expected to come from ) .",
    "technically , the toll is that we have to look for the large logarithms in real processes .",
    "however , from the physical point of view , this is a gain rather than a loss , since we get rid of the logarithms which are just an artifact of the renormalization prescription .",
    "in fact , we can promote the status of the running coupling ; instead of being a formal attribute of the renormalization group it may become a dynamical form - factor due to the real processes . before we search for these large logarithms ,",
    "let us try to understand why the subtraction point @xmath48 is a natural physical point for the renormalization .    according to the principle of causality",
    ", the full picture of the qcd evolution develops _ before _ the measurement .",
    "thus , the system of fields must be coherent .",
    "it represents , at most , virtual decomposition of a hadron in terms of an unnatural set of modes which emerge as propagating fields only after the interaction happens .",
    "therefore , the radiative corrections to the propagation of fields should not cause any phase shifts along the line of hadron propagation and hence , the real part of virtual loops should vanish for the state of free propagation .",
    "this is exactly what is achieved by the on - mass - shell renormalization of the asymptotic states in scattering theory .",
    "if the hadron is assumed to move along the light cone , the real parts of the vertices and self - energies should vanish at @xmath48 .",
    "contributions ( [ eq : e3.9 ] ) and ( [ eq : e3.10 ] ) of the retarded gluon self - energy and vertex ( both renormalized at the point @xmath48 ) to the evolution equation are double - logarithmic with respect to the collinear cut - off @xmath50 .",
    "this cut - off already appears in the imaginary parts of the self - energy and vertex .",
    "therefore , it is connected with real processes .",
    "even if the divergent terms do cancel , one still has to understand why .",
    "the physical mechanism of this cancelation can only be due to interference , and it has to work even at the classical level .",
    "the collinear divergence is both a classical effect and an artifact of theoretical model with massless charged particles .",
    "therefore , it should not be treated as an artificial phenomenon caused by spurious poles of a special gauge .",
    "indeed , the physical mechanism of the collinear divergence can be easily translated into the language of space - time .",
    "consider a charged particle that instantaneously changes its velocity from @xmath51 to @xmath52 at a time @xmath53 . at some later time",
    "@xmath54 , the picture of the field is as follows . outside the sphere of radius @xmath55 , there is an unchanged static proper field of the initial - state particle .",
    "inside this sphere , there is the newly created proper field of the final - state particle .",
    "the field of radiation ( which has the old and the new static fields as the boundary conditions ) is located on the sphere itself . if @xmath56 then the charge is inside the sphere and decoupled from the radiation field . at @xmath57 ,",
    "the charge never decouples from the radiation field and this leads to the divergence in the integration over the time of the interaction .",
    "thus , assigning a finite mass @xmath58 to the field is a test for true collinear divergence .",
    "this is also a cure , since then @xmath56 and the problem disappears .",
    "alternatively , one may provide at least a single interaction with a third body which interrupts the emission process after some time @xmath59 . in both cases , we encounter a dimensional physical parameter which regulates the time - length of interaction between the charge and the radiation field . if @xmath60 , then the smallest of two quantities , @xmath59 and @xmath61 , is the physical cut - off for the emission process .",
    "let us assume that some mass @xmath1 can be introduced as a collinear cut - off . if this cut - off cancels in the full assembly of diagrams in any given order , then the theory has no single dimensional parameter .",
    "this is exactly the case of pqcd where the parameter @xmath62 establishes , at most , an absolute boundary of its validity .",
    "all practical calculations are possible only for momenta higher than some @xmath63 .",
    "all the divergences , including soft and collinear , are usually removed by means of the dimensional regularization with reference to the kln theorem ; however , this is not the case we address .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : sne4 ] , we calculate contributions of real emission processes to the causal qcd evolution . the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig7]a and [ fig : fig7]b , with the unitary cut through the vertex , and the interference diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]c , do not lead to terms with @xmath64 .",
    "they , however , include many terms with the collinear cut - off which eliminates a part of phase - space which does not satisfy the emission criterion . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sne5 ] we study the radiative corrections in the lt - transition mode .",
    "they confirm the general trend .",
    "thus , we have proved that in the time - ordered picture of evolution the uv - renormalization should be performed in such a way that radiative corrections do not affect the initial state and bring no scale into the problem .",
    "the scale is brought in by the emission process and is defined by parameters of the final state that emerge after the collision .",
    "the most important conclusion that follows from this observation is that the evolution equations must be modified , _ viz .",
    "_ , the universal running coupling that accompanies splitting kernels in the dglap equations must be exchanged for the form - factors which depend on the type and scale of the emission process .",
    "this is required by causality of the inclusive measurement .",
    "it is high time to understand why we need a theory with a physical cut - off of the collinear emission and why we can not rely on the standard approach of pqcd .",
    "the latter was constructed as a theory of the s - matrix at asymptotic energies .",
    "the concept of asymptotic freedom is formulated precisely in this context .",
    "the running coupling is always introduced as a certain assembly of radiative corrections regardless of whether the perturbation series is divergent . in pqcd , the way to assemble vertices and self - energies is defined by the structure of feynman amplitudes of exclusive processes , and it is very important that the collinear ( mass ) singularities are , at any price , removed from this assembly .",
    "the most popular technical tool to do this is based on dimensional regularization of the feynman amplitudes .",
    "this method does not distinguish between uv- , ir- , and mass - singularities , despite the different physical nature of these divergences .",
    "sometimes , one may trace that cancelations of certain divergences , are due to interference of various partial amplitudes .",
    "in other cases , one may observe that the soft amplitudes exponentiate and die out in the quantities like total cross - sections .",
    "the underlying calculations always implicitly rely on the structure of the space of states , which includes _ arbitrarily soft _ states of emission ( otherwise , the exponentiation makes no sense ) .",
    "such a space of states is completely physical in qed but not in realistic qcd .",
    "usually , the collinear singularities are forced to cancel with the aid of the kln theorem which redefines the states of scattering by admixing a probabilistic distribution of soft ( collinear ) states .",
    "the proof of the kln theorem is intimately connected with the definition of the states , _ vis . _",
    ", it is sensitive to the parameter of resolution , which is hidden in the definition of the degenerate states .",
    "once again , the theorem was derived under the influence of qed where even very soft photons can be resolved in the asymptotic states , provided a sufficiently long time is allowed for the measurement . to approach this idealized regime in qcd",
    ", one has to limit the theoretical analysis to exclusive processes with very energetic final - state jets ( insensitive to several additional soft hadrons which might simulate the emission of extra soft gluons ) .",
    "however , even in qed there are cases when the recipe of kln is not supposed to work . for instance , in the qed plasma , the space of states is populated , and we are not free to assign arbitrary statistical weights to the collinear states .    in nuclear collisions , the space of states has a quite different structure . unlike a scattering problem",
    ", the states must be defined at a finite time of evolution .",
    "furthermore , the longitudinal fields can not be absorbed into the definition of stable charged particles ( by means of on - mass - shell renormalization ) and are not geometrically separated from the fields of emission .",
    "nevertheless , the technical problems are not frightening , since the normal modes in dense and exited ( hot ) nuclear matter ( to the first approximation ) can be computed perturbatively . in sec .  [",
    "sec : ss1 ] , we compute the mass of a transverse plasmon ( a collective mode ) , which is now the final state for the emission in the qcd evolution process .",
    "the distribution of gluons that induce a plasmon mass is defined by the process of multiple - gluon production , and the plasmon mass is the function of the time of the distribution measurement .",
    "the result of this calculation clarifies the correspondence between the two approaches .",
    "it is summarized by eq .",
    "( [ eq : s1.12 ] ) : the larger the transverse momentum @xmath4 of the emission is , the earlier it is formed as the radiation field , the less it is affected by the interaction with other partons , and the smaller its effective mass is .",

    "it turns out that the dispersive part of the retarded self - energy is always proportional to @xmath39 and may contribute only to the renormalization of the propagator . at first glance",
    ", the non - dispersive part seems to be capable of generating the effective mass of the plasmon .",
    "however , even in the case of a finite density of emitted gluons , the non - dispersive part remains quasi - local because of the singular nature of longitudinal fields in the null - plane dynamics , and it vanishes in the course of renormalization .",
    "we conclude that it is impossible to generate an effective mass of a quasi - particle in the null - plane dynamics .    in order to smooth out the geometry of the longitudinal fields , we had to choose another hamiltonian dynamics which is described in sec .",

    "the physical mechanisms of the screening effects ( like the generation of the plasmon mass ) are known to be localized in a finite space - time domain .",

    "the net yield of this paper is as follows .",
    "the interaction between the two ultrarelativistic nuclei switches on almost instantaneously .",
    "this interaction explores all possible quantum fluctuations which could have developed by the moment of the collision and freezes ( as the final states ) only the fluctuations compatible with the measured observable .",
    "these snapshots can not have an arbitrary structure , since the emerging configurations must be consistent with all the interactions which are effective on the time - scale of the emission process .",
    "in other words , the modes of the radiation field which are excited in the course of the nuclear collision should be the collective excitations of the dense quark - gluon system .",
    "this conclusion is the result of an intensive search of the _ scale _ inherent in the process of a heavy - ion collision .",
    "we proved that the scale is determined only by the physical properties of the final state .",
    "eventually , the scenario for the ultra - relativistic nuclear collision promises to be more perturbative than the standard pqcd",
    ". it will be free from the ambiguities of the standard factorization scheme inherent in the cascade models .",
    "this approach is novel for the field of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions , but the underlying physics is not new .",
    "quantum transitions in solids always excite collective modes , like photons in the medium , phonons , or electrons with effective masses and charges ( polarons ) .",
    "similar phenomena are known in particle and atomic physics .",
    "for example :    _ 1_. let an electron - positron pair be created by two photons . if the energy of the collision is large , then the electron and positron are created in the states of freely propagating particles and the cross - section of this process accurately agrees with the tree - level perturbative calculation . however ,",
    "if the energy of the collision is near the threshold of the process , then the relative velocity of the electron and positron is small , and they are likely to form positronium .",
    "it would be incredibly difficult to compute this case using scattering theory .",
    "indeed , one has to account for the multiple emission of soft photons which gradually builds up the coulomb field between the electron and positron and binds them into the positronium .",
    "however , the problem is easily solved if we realize that the bound state _ is _ the final state for the process .",
    "we can still use low - order perturbation theory to study the transition between the two photons and the bound state of a pair @xcite .    _",
    "2_. let an excited atom be in a cavity with ideally conducting walls .",
    "the system is characterized by three parameters : the size @xmath73 of the cavity , the wave - length @xmath74 of the emission , and the life - time @xmath75 of the excited state .",
    "the questions are , in what case will the emitted photon bounce between the cavity walls , and when will the emission field be one of the normal cavity modes .",
    "the answer is very simple .",
    "if @xmath76 , the photon will behave like a bouncing ball .",
    "when the line of emission is very narrow , @xmath77 , the cavity mode will be excited .",
    "it is perfectly clear that in the first case , the transition current that emits the photon is localized in the atom . in the second case it is not . by the time of emission , the currents in the conducting walls have to rearrange charges in such a way that the emission field immediately satisfies the proper boundary conditions .",
    "we thus have a collective transition in an extended system .    from a practical point of view , these two different problems are united by the method of obtaining their solutions . a part of the interaction ( coulomb interaction in the first case , and the interaction of radiation with the cavity walls in the second case )",
    "is attributed to the new `` bare '' hamiltonian which is diagonalized by the wave functions of the final state modes .",
    "this allows one to reach the solution in a most economical way .",

    "one can consistently introduce the distribution only in connection with the procedure of its measurement . throughout this paper , we concentrat on the inclusively measured one - particle distribution and argue that the full final state of the collision is always prepared as a fluctuation before the moment of the inclusive measurement ( and that the measurement only excites the system of the allowed final states . ) below , supporting this idea , we construct the basis of states that naturally complies with the lorentz contraction of the incoming objects and includes both strongly and weakly localized field modes . in terms of this basis , a snapshot of a virtual fluctuation before a collision ( with as of , yet , coherently balanced phases ) already looks like a distribution of hard particles ( with high @xmath4 ) moving through the slowly - varying fields ( with low @xmath4 ) .",
    "the interaction just freezes this fluctuation with the wrong phases and converts it into the true distribution , in which the slow fields are immediately screened by the interaction with the hard particles .",
    "thus , even at a very early time after a collision of two nuclei , the emerging final state is rather a system of plasmons , than an ensemble of free partons .      the qcd evolution in high - energy processes is always described in the null  plane dynamics , which is the only one where the standard variable of evolution equations , the feynman @xmath227 , is unambiguously defined .",
    "it is tempting to try to compute the screening effects staying within framework of these dynamics .",
    "the procedure seems to be straightforward .",
    "one has to compute the retarded propagator ( [ eq : e1.8 ] ) for the field of emission , @xmath403 accounting for the effects of the final - state interaction ( collective nature of the final states ) in the invariants @xmath404 and @xmath405 of the gluon self - energy . in this formula ,",

    "thus , we can draw two conclusions .",
    "( i ) the mass of a plasmon with momentum @xmath310 is generated by the amplitude of the forward scattering of a gluon on some distribution of states only , if the gluon field between the two successive interactions is longitudinal , or if the interaction is contact .",
    "( ii ) in the null - plane dynamics , these interactions are local in @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , they are incapable of producing any screening effects , which are genuinely _ non - local_. in order to incorporate screening effects into the evolution equations , we have to exchange the null - plane hamiltonian dynamics for another dynamics in which the fields would behave in a less singular way .",
    "it was explicitly demonstrated that it is impossible to adequately describe the basic process of forward scattering , which is responsible for the generation of the plasmon mass , in the null - plane dynamics .",
    "the problem arises due to the singular behavior of the field pattern which is defined as the static field with respect to the time @xmath32 .",
    "this singular behavior shows that the choice of the hamiltonian dynamics and proper definition of the field states is highly nontrivial and important .",
    "the problem we encounter in connection with screening is even more general .",
    "indeed , a search for the qgp in heavy - ion collisions is , in the first place , a search for evidence of entropy production . before the collision",
    ", the quark and gluon fields are assembled into two coherent wave packets ( the nuclei ) , and therefore , the initial entropy equals zero",
    ". the coherence is lost , and entropy is created due to the interaction .",
    "though one may wish to rely on the invariant formula @xmath412 , which expresses the entropy @xmath194 via the density matrix @xmath413 , at least one basis of states should be found explicitly .",
    "thus , it is imperative to find a way to describe quarks and gluons of both nuclei as well as the products of their interaction using _ the same hamiltonian dynamics_. an appropriate choice for the gluons is always difficult because the gauge is a global object ( as are the hamiltonian dynamics ) and both nuclei should be described using the same gauge condition .",
    "quantum field theory has a strict definition of _ dynamics_.",
    "this notion was introduced by dirac @xcite at the end of the 1940 s in connection with his attempt to build a quantum theory of the gravitational field .",
    "every ( hamiltonian ) dynamics includes its specific definition of the quantum mechanical observables on the ( arbitrary ) space - like surfaces , as well as the means to describe the evolution of the observables from the `` earlier '' space - like surface to the `` later '' one .",
    "the primary choice of the degrees of freedom is effective if , even without any interaction , the dynamics of the normal modes adequately reflects the main physical features of the phenomenon .",
    "the intuitive physical picture clearly indicates that the normal modes of the fields participating in the collision of the two nuclei should be compatible with their lorentz contraction . unlike the incoming plane waves of the standard scattering theory , the nuclei have a well - defined shape and",
    "the space - time domain of their intersection is also well - defined .",
    "of the ten symmetries of the poincar group , only rotation around the collision @xmath414-axis , boost along it , and the translations and boosts in the transverse @xmath227 and @xmath228-directions survive .",
    "the idea of the collision of two plane sheets immediately leads us to the _ wedge form _ ; the states of quark and gluon fields before and after the collision must be confined within the past and future light cones ( wedges ) with the @xmath415-collision plane as the edge .",
    "therefore , it is profitable to choose , in advance , the set of normal modes which have the symmetry of the localized interaction and carry quantum numbers adequate to this symmetry .",
    "these quantum numbers are the transverse components of momentum and the rapidity of the particle ( which replaces the component @xmath416 of its momentum ) . in this",

    "the states of free quark and gluon fields are defined ( normalized ) on the space - like hyper - surfaces of the constant proper time @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",

    "on the other hand , after the collision , this gauge simulates a local ( in rapidity ) temporal - axial gauge . this feature provides a smooth transition to the boost - invariant regime of the created matter expansion ( as a first approximation ) . particularly , addressing the problem of screening , we will be able to compute the plasmon mass in a uniform fashion , considering each rapidity interval separately and using the ( local ) temporal axial gauge .",
    "the feature of the states to collapse at the interaction vertex is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the collision .",
    "a simple optical prototype of the wedge dynamics is the _ camera obscura _ ( a dark chamber with the pin - hole in the wall ) . amongst the many possible",
    "_ a priori _ ways to decompose the incoming light , the camera selects only one .",
    "only the spherical harmonics centered at the pin - hole can penetrate inside the camera .",
    "the spherical waves reveal their angular dependence at some distance from the center and build up the image on the opposite wall . here",
    ", we suggest to view the collision of two nuclei as a kind of diffraction of the initial wave functions through the `` pin - hole '' @xmath418 in @xmath419-plane .",
