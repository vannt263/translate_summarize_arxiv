    "numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on a lattice predict a phase transition ( or crossover ) from hadronic matter to deconfined , chirally symmetric matter at sufficiently large energy densities  @xcite .",
    "the critical energy density calculated is typically @xmath3",
    "gev/@xmath4 , approximately 5 times the density of normal nuclear matter .",
    "the primary goal of high energy heavy ion physics is to achieve such a transition and to study this new state of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in order to better understand fundamental properties of qcd . with the new collider rhic",
    ", the field has recently reached a new energy regime , which will be a milestone in the endeavor to attain this goal .    the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    "is located at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) on long island , new york .",
    "rhic has provided au+au collisions at @xmath5  gev ; au+au collisions at @xmath2  gev ; and au+au , d+au , and p+p collisions at @xmath1  gev . at these energies ,",
    "hard scattering is expected to contribute significantly to particle production .      in order to understand the complicated dynamics of a heavy ion collision",
    ", one needs a calibrated , understood probe .",
    "this can be provided by hard - scattered partons , for which the fragmentation dominates particle production at high @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", it is known that the fragmentation of partons into jets dominates the production of hadrons above @xmath6  gev / c  @xcite in p+p collisions .",
    "for the hard - scattered partons to serve as a probe of heavy ion collisions , a baseline for high @xmath0 particle production , at the same @xmath7 , must first be established from p+p collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum_pp ] shows the neutral pion production cross section measured in p+p collisions at @xmath1  gev by the phenix experiment  @xcite .     measured in p+p collisions at @xmath1  gev by the phenix experiment  @xcite .",
    "comparisons are shown to nlo pqcd calculations with two different fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_pp ] _ , width=340 ]    the production cross section is well described by nlo pqcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the measurement in p+p collisions can provide a baseline for measurements in au+au collisions .    in heavy ion collisions , the boundary between where hard and where soft production dominates the measured hadron yields is affected by flow  @xcite and possibly parton coalescence  @xcite .",
    "this complicates the high @xmath0 region between 2 and 4 gev / c .",
    "however , in run  ii at rhic ( @xmath1  gev ) , hadrons have been measured up to @xmath8  gev / c in au+au collisions  @xcite . at such large transverse momenta",
    ", interactions are expected to be incoherent even in heavy ion collisions , and perturbative qcd calculations can reliably be used as a baseline for hadron production  @xcite .",
    "thus , at sufficiently high transverse momenta , we still have a calibrated probe for heavy ion collisions",
    ". hard scatterings provide a particularly valuable probe , in fact , because they occur early in the collision , leaving the hard - scattered partons sensitive to the properties of the collision medium .",
    "a hard scattering occurs on a timescale of @xmath9 , which for @xmath10  gev is approximately 0.1  fm / c .",
    "this is smaller than the time it takes for the system to equilibrate  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hard - scattered partons experience the entire space - time of the system and serve as a probe of the produced medium .",
    "it has been predicted that the hard - scattered partons will reinteract in a deconfined medium of free color charges , losing much of their energy  @xcite .",
    "this would result in a suppression of the high transverse momentum tail of the hadron spectrum , where the hadrons are likely to be the leading particles of jets , and is known as `` jet quenching . ''      in a au+au collision , the properties of the produced medium depend on the centrality of the collision . at large impact parameter , the overlap region between the two nuclei ( or system size )",
    "is small ; and at small impact parameter , the system size is large .",
    "heavy ion collisions are generally binned into centrality selections .",
    "such selections can be classified according to their geometry , with a class of events having a mean number of participating nucleons @xmath11 and a mean number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath12 determined by a glauber  @xcite model simulation .",
    "the maximum @xmath11 possible for a au+au collision is 394  ( 2x197 ) , and @xmath12 exceeds 1000 for the most central events .",
    "physics observables are presented as a function of centrality , from the most peripheral selection , corresponding to the events with the least amount of overlap between the nuclei , to the most central selection , corresponding to the events with the most overlap .",
    "centrality is expressed as a percentage of the total inelastic cross section .",
    "at large transverse momenta , where the cross sections are small and particles are expected to undergo incoherent interactions , a heavy ion ( a+a ) collision can be viewed simply as a superposition of binary nucleon - nucleon ( n+n ) collisions .",
    "the scaling between systems of different sizes is the number of sources for hard parton scatterings .",
    "therefore , to compare au+au collisions with p+p collisions , the scaling is the mean number of nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath12 , or alternately the glauber nuclear overlap function @xmath13 .",
    "we quantify the effects of the nuclear medium by the nuclear modification factor @xmath14 , which is the fraction of yields at high @xmath0 measured in a+a collisions to those measured in p+p collisions scaled by @xmath12 ( eq .  [ eq : raa_nbinary ] ) or @xmath13 ( eq .  [ eq : raa_taa ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 at low @xmath0 , where soft production dominates the measured yields , @xmath14 is less than one because soft production is expected to scale with the number of participants @xmath11 , rather than @xmath12 . at transverse",
    "momenta sufficiently large to be in a hard - scattering regime and in the absence of any nuclear effects , @xmath14 is expected to be equal to unity ; in which case a a+a collision can be described as a superposition of binary n+n collisions . a deviation from unity at high @xmath0 is a measure of the effect of the nuclear medium .",
    "previously measured nuclear effects include the `` cronin '' effect  @xcite , an enhancement in the yields relative to binary scaling ( @xmath16 ) attributed to @xmath17 broadening due to initial state multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "the predicted energy loss due to the dense medium , or jet quenching , is a suppression in the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "the suppression persisting up to @xmath27  gev / c , observed in run ii for @xmath1  gev , was successfully predicted by theoretical calculations that invoke an energy loss proportional to the energy of the parton combined with shadowing and initial - state @xmath17-broadening  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "the most recent measurement at @xmath2  gev from run iv is also included in the figure and shows a similar suppression for @xmath28  gev / c .",
    "due to the high multiplicity environment , jets can not be directly observed in a heavy ion collision .",
    "when interpreting the modification of the particle spectra at high @xmath0 as an effect of the medium on the hard - scattered partons , one assumes that the hadrons measured at high @xmath0 emanate from jets .",
    "a method to detect the presence of jets in high multiplicity environment is via two - particle angular correlation measurements . to extract the jet signal from the correlation distributions , other sources of correlation , such as flow and resonance decays , and the combinatorial background",
    "need to be disentangled from the correlations due to jets .",
    "the star experiment has made such a measurement  @xcite and found that the away - side jet disappears in central au+au collisions .",
    "this is shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dau ] .",
    "the `` near - side '' correlations are those at @xmath29 , and the `` away - side '' are at @xmath30 .",
    "since the near - side contains the trigger particle , the correlation function can be understood as a conditional probability .",
    "when triggering on a high @xmath0 particle , the near - side correlation looks very similar to the correlation due to jets measured in p+p collisions ( black histogram ) ; but there is no jet correlation seen on the away - side in central au+au events , contrary to what is measured in p+p collisions .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the hadrons that we measure at high @xmath0 in central au+au collisions come from hard scatterings near the surface of the system .",
    "this would allow one jet to escape the medium ; while the corresponding jet must traverse the dense medium where it could interact , lose much its energy , and become lost in the low @xmath0 soft part of the spectrum .",
    "although both observations that were made in central au+au collisions at rhic ( the suppression in the hadron yields at high @xmath0 and the disappearance of the away - side jet ) seem to indicate that the hard - scattered partons lose energy in the dense medium , the effect of the `` cold '' nuclear medium ( p+a or d+a collisions ) is essential to rule out initial - state nuclear effects .",
    "in run  iii at rhic , high @xmath0 particle production was studied in d+au collisions . to distinguish initial - state effects from final - state effects on the suppression observed in central au+au collisions ,",
    "d+au collisions provide a good comparison experiment with only initial - state nuclear effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : dau ] shows the results from all 4 rhic experiments @xcite .     vs. @xmath0 , and",
    "the bottom right panel shows the angular correlation measurement due to jets .",
    "the upper left shows @xmath14 for neutral pions and charged hadrons measured in d+au collisions by phenix @xcite .",
    "the upper right shows @xmath14 for charged hadrons measured in different centrality selections in d+au collisions by phobos @xcite , where the most central in d+au collisions is compared to the measurement in central au+au collisions ( the red line ) .",
    "the lower left is @xmath14 in d+au collisions compared to central au+au collisions measured by brahms @xcite .",
    "the lower right is the jet correlation signal measured in p+p collisions , d+au collisions , and central au+au collisions by star @xcite.__,width=491 ]    from these results , the consistent conclusion is that the suppression observed in central au+au collisions is not observed in d+au collisions .",
    "similarly , the disappearance of the away - side jet ( bottom right panel ) is also not observed in d+au collisions .",
    "this indicates that the novel phenomena observed in central au+au collisions at rhic are due to effects of the medium produced in these collisions , rather than initial - state nuclear effects .",
    "the measurements of high @xmath0 hadron production in au+au and d+au collisions have been compared with theoretical calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : raa_theory ] shows the model prediction for @xmath14 in central au+au events ( lower red line ) , which includes the effect of energy loss of hard - scattered partons .",
    "it is in good agreement with the data . for the comparison to the measurement in d+au collsions ,",
    "the predictions from the same model include only initial - state effects , shown by the different lines ( for varying initial - state effects ) near and above @xmath31 .",
    "the model results for d+au collisions are also in reasonable agreement with the data .     as a function of @xmath0 compared with theoretical predictions for central au+au collisions  @xcite and d+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "the boxes around the data points indicate the systematic errors correlated in @xmath0 , and the shaded grey band at 1 indicates the percent normalization error . [",
    "fig : raa_theory ] _ , width=491 ]    this supports the conclusion that a final - state nuclear medium effect , such as parton energy loss , is necessary to describe the suppression observed in central au+au collisions .",
    "at rhic , one of the most significant observations thus far is the depletion of high @xmath0 hadrons in central au+au collsions .",
    "such a suppression is consistent with predictions in which hard - scattered partons lose energy in a dense medium .",
    "complementing this observation is the discovery of the disappearance of the away - side jet in central au+au collisions , which can also be explained by interactions of the hard - scattered partons in a dense medium . as a reference for the effect of cold nuclear matter on hadron spectra at high @xmath0 and on correlations due to jets , the same measurements were made in d+au collisions .",
    "the charged hadron and neutral pion spectra were found not to be suppressed relative to the binary - scaled spectra measured in p+p collisions , and the away - side jet was found not to disappear .",
    "the measurements of @xmath14 are in agreement with theoretical predictions both for central au+au and for d+au collisions .",
    "the model includes the effect of energy loss in a dense medium , as well as initial - state nuclear effects , in central au+au collisions , and only initial - state effects in d+au collisions .    both the results from d+au collisions and the comparisons to theory support the conclusion that the suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons is an effect due to the produced medium in central au+au collisions .",
