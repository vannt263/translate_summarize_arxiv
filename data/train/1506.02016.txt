    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) anderson model , first introduced in 1958  @xcite , remains the focus of active research .",
    "the analysis of this model showed that all eigenstates are exponentially localised for infinitely large samples ( see , e.g. , the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "for the case of weak and uncorrelated disorder , thouless derived the expression for the localisation length that now bears his name  @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations , however , revealed that thouless expression fails at the band centre , where the actual localisation length was numerically found to be different from the expected value  @xcite . as was understood by kappus and wegner  @xcite ,",
    "this discrepancy is due to the failure of the born approximation ; with the use of a quite sophisticated method , kappus and wegner derived an approximate expression which explained the numerical data reported in ref .",
    "later on , using a different approach , derrida and gardner showed  @xcite that this anomaly is a resonance effect that emerges at the band centre , @xmath0 .",
    "they also found another anomaly for @xmath1 and suggested that similar anomalies should appear for other resonant energies defined by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are integer number .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were subsequently extended to a whole neighbourhood of the band centre  @xcite ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the interest in the anomalies of the anderson model was raised significantly after these anomalies were linked to the so - called single - parameter scaling theory ( sps ) .",
    "the sps theory was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and was based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the phases of the scattered waves . in the 1d case",
    ", the sps theory can be reduced to the statement that all moments of the transmission coefficient through a random barrier can be expressed in terms of the first two moments . as a result",
    ", the whole distribution of the transmission coefficient is expected to depend on the ratio between the localisation length and the size of the random chain .",
    "however , it was numerically shown long ago  @xcite that the rpa fails at the band centre of the anderson model .",
    "thus , the band centre anomaly ( as well as the other resonances ) can serve as a touchstone for the study of the sps hypothesis . as was recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sps hypothesis is violated also for the resonance at @xmath1 ( see also the discussion in refs .",
    "since the phase distribution is not flat whenever the energy lies in a whole neighbourhood of the resonant values , one can expect that the sps hypothesis should not be rigorously valid in the whole energy band of the 1d anderson model with weak disorder .",
    "this `` anti - sps '' hypothesis is still not proved ; the study of the anomalies of the anderson model for @xmath0 and @xmath1 can provide a way to test the validity of this conjecture .    the works on the band - centre anomaly mentioned so far considered the anderson model with _ uncorrelated _ disorder .",
    "in the literature , almost no attention has been given to the case of correlated disorder , the main exception being ref .",
    "@xcite which , however , was focused on specific cases of very short - ranged correlations .",
    "only very recently the effects of correlated disorder on the localisation of the band - centre states have begun to be investigated , in the wake of the discovery that the band - centre anomaly can be strongly reduced if the site energies exhibit exponentially decaying , positive correlations  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we derive analytical results that show how the band - centre anomaly is modified when disorder possesses _ arbitrary _ correlations .",
    "the general expressions that we obtained allow us to treat the correlations considered in  @xcite as a particular case and to show how , in general , different kinds of disorder correlations can either enhance or suppress the anomaly at the centre of the energy band . to derive an analytical expression for the localisation length in a neighbourhood of the band centre",
    ", we relied on the hamiltonian map formalism  @xcite and we replaced a map for the angle variable with its continuum limit . in order to do so ,",
    "we had to establish a rigorous correspondence between random maps with intercorrelated coloured noises and stochastic differential equations with the same features . this led us to derive a discrete integration scheme for stochastic differential equations with self- and cross - correlated noises .",
    "this scheme is another important result of the present paper .    to analyse the band - centre anomaly we considered the behaviour of the localisation length and that of the probability distribution for the angle variable ( which is equivalent to the scattering phase ) .",
    "our analytical results show that disorder correlations shape the localisation length in a twofold way : on the one hand , the modulation of the phase distribution causes a deviation of the actual lyapunov exponent from the value predicted by the expression first derived by izrailev and krokhin  @xcite , which generalises thouless formula to the case of correlated disorder .",
    "this discrepancy is a resonance effect and represents the `` anomaly '' in the presence of correlated disorder . on the other hand ,",
    "disorder correlations modify the localisation length via the power - spectrum factor which is already present in the formula obtained by izrailev and krokhin in ref .",
    "@xcite . by manipulating this factor",
    ", one can produce very strong localisation or effective delocalisation of the band - centre states .",
    "the modulation of the phase distribution close to the band centre is the hallmark of the anomaly that occurs there .",
    "our analytical expressions show that positive , exponentially decaying correlations of the disorder flatten the invariant distribution , thereby reducing the anomaly , as observed in  @xcite .",
    "the opposite effect occurs when correlations decrease exponentially in magnitude but oscillate between positive and negative values .",
    "such correlations strongly enhance the band - centre anomaly . to complete the picture",
    ", we consider a third type of correlations , which describe a lattice formed by two statistically independent and physically interpenetrating sublattices . we show that these correlations do not alter the modulation of the invariant distribution with respect to the case of uncorrelated disorder",

    "this entails that the anomaly at the band centre becomes unstable as @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , although at the exact band centre the invariant distribution keeps the form  ( [ bcrho_uncor ] ) , the fact that @xmath267 implies that the rescaled parameter  ( [ res_kappa ] ) grows very quickly for any infinitesimal deviation of the energy from the band centre . therefore the invariant distribution becomes uniform very fast when the energy moves away from the band centre .",
    "we can conclude that , depending on the value of the power spectrum at the band centre , correlations satisfying condition  ( [ twolat ] ) can either strengthen or weaken the band centre anomaly .",
    "they do not enhance or suppress the modulation of the invariant distribution , but they can widen or shrink the neighbourhood of the band centre where the invariant distribution is significantly non - uniform .",
    "in this paper we have studied the band - centre anomaly in the 1d anderson model with weak _ correlated _ disorder .",
    "our perturbative analysis used two essential tools : the hamiltonian map approach and the continuum limit .",
    "the hamiltonian map approach interprets the spatial structure of the electronic states in terms of the time evolution of a classical parametric oscillator .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the angle variable of this oscillator is dictated by the random map  ( [ fourth ] ) .",
    "replacing this map with a corresponding stochastic differential equation is a crucial step that allowed us to derive our analytical results and that required the elaboration of the specific integration scheme  ( [ scheme3 ] ) .",
    "we obtained analytical expressions for the invariant distribution of the phase variable and for the localisation length .",
    "these results are valid for weak disorder with arbitrary correlations and generalise the formulae obtained in  @xcite for the case of uncorrelated disorder .",
    "when disorder is uncorrelated , the invariant distribution of the phase variable , which is uniform for non - resonant values of the energy , becomes modulated for energies lying in a neighbourhood of the band centre .",
    "this modulation , in turn , generates a deviation of the inverse localisation length from the values predicted by thouless formula . in qualitative terms",
    ", this picture holds also when disorder displays spatial correlations . from a quantitative point of view ,",
    "however , the _ size _ and _ extension _ of the resonance effect can be dramatically altered .",
    "two extreme cases are discussed in sec .",
    "[ exp_dec ] and  [ oscexpdec ] .",
    "in the first case , the site energies exhibit positive correlations which decay exponentially with the distance between sites . in this case",
    "the resonance effect is suppressed upon increasing the correlation length @xmath13 . in the second case",
    ", the correlations between site energies also decrease exponentially in magnitude , but oscillate between positive and negative values . in this case",
    ", increasing the correlation length @xmath13 strongly enhances the modulation of the invariant measure , which tends to a sum of four delta peaks for @xmath200 . correspondingly , the difference between the inverse localisation length and the value predicted by the formula derived by izrailev and krokhin increases with @xmath13 .",
    "the specific long - range correlations analysed in sec .",
    "[ longrangedcor ] do not alter the modulation of the invariant distribution with respect to the case of uncorrelated disorder , but can strengthen or weaken the anomaly in a different way , i.e. , they can enlarge or restrict the interval of the energy in which the resonant effect is relevant .    in conclusion , we have shown that correlations of the disorder can alter the band - centre anomaly very strongly and in a variety of ways .",
    "in particular , specific correlations can suppress or magnify the resonance effect at the centre of the energy band .",
