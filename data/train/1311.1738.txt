    "over the last decades , the availability and widespread diffusion of network data on typically very large scales have created the impetus for the development of new theories for modeling and describing the properties of large random networks . nonetheless , and despite the vast and rapidly growing body of literature on network analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , the study of the asymptotic behavior of network models has proven rather difficult in most cases . indeed , because the limiting properties of many such models remain hard to determine , methodologies for carrying out fundamental inferential tasks such as parameter estimation , hypothesis and goodness - of - fit testing with provable asymptotic guarantees have yet to be developed for most network models .",
    "exponential random graph models @xcite form one of the most prominent families of statistical models for random graphs , but also one for which the issue of present lack of understanding of their general asymptotic properties is particularly pressing .",
    "these rather general models are exponential families of probability distributions over graphs , whereby the natural sufficient statistics are virtually any functions on the space of graphs that are deemed to capture the features of interest .",
    "such statistics may include , for instance , the number of edges or copies of any finite subgraph , as well as more complex quantities such as the degree sequence or degree distribution , and combinations thereof . as a result , these models are able to capture a wide variety of common network tendencies by representing a complex global structure through a set of tractable local features .",
    "they are especially useful when one wants to construct models that resemble observed networks as closely as possible , but without going into details of the specific process underlying network formation . due to their flexibility and modeling power ,",
    "exponential random graph models are among the most widespread models in network analysis , with countless applications in multiple disciplines , including social sciences , statistics and statistical mechanics .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "being exponential families with finite support , one might expect exponential random graph models to enjoy a rather simple asymptotic form .",
    "though in fact , virtually all these models are highly nonstandard : as the size of the network increases , they exhibit properties that can not be described using traditional tools of asymptotic parametric statistics for i.i.d . data , but require instead more sophisticated analysis .",
    "indeed , even for the @xmath0 model of @xcite , which postulates independent edges and is perhaps the simplest kind of exponential random graph model ( of which the erds - rnyi model is an easily handled instance ) , consistency and normality of the maximum likelihood estimator have been established only recently with non - trivial efforts @xcite , while goodness - of - fit testing still remains an open problem @xcite .",
    "for general random graph models which do not assume independent edges , very little was known about their asymptotics ( but see @xcite and @xcite ) until the groundbreaking work of chatterjee and diaconis @xcite . by combining the recent theory of graphons with a large deviation result about the erds - rnyi model established in @xcite",
    ", they showed that the limiting properties of many exponential random graph models can be obtained by solving a certain variational problem in the graphon space ( see section [ graphon ] for a summary of this important contribution ) .",
    "such a result has provided a principled way of resolving the large sample behavior of exponential random graph models and has in fact led to many other novel and insightful results about this class of models .",
    "still , the variational technique in @xcite often does not admit an explicit solution and additional work is required .",
    "in this article we further advance our understating of the asymptotics of exponential random graph models by giving a complete characterization of the asymptotic extremal properties of a simple yet challenging @xmath1-parameter exponential random graph model . in more detail , for @xmath2 , let @xmath3 denote the set of all labeled simple ( i.e. , undirected , with no loops or multiple edges ) graphs on @xmath4 nodes .",
    "notice that @xmath5 .",
    "for a graph @xmath6 with @xmath7 vertices and a graph @xmath8 with @xmath9 vertices , the density homomorphism of @xmath8 in @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the number of homomorphisms from @xmath8 to @xmath10 , i.e. , edge preserving maps from @xmath9 to @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 is just the probability that any mapping from @xmath9 into @xmath7 is edge - preserving .    for each @xmath4 , we will study the exponential family @xmath14 of probability distribution on @xmath3 which assigns to a graph @xmath15 the probability @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a single edge , @xmath18 is a pre - chosen finite simple graph ( say a triangle , a two - star , etc . ) , and @xmath19 is the normalizing constant satisfying @xmath20 although seemingly simple , this model is well known to exhibit a wealth of non - trivial features ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and challenging asymptotics ( see @xcite ) . the two parameters @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 allow one to adjust the relative influence of different local features  in our case , the edge density and , more importantly , the density of the subgraph @xmath18 . in statistical physics , we commonly refer to the density of edges as the particle density and the density of subgraph @xmath18 as the energy density .",
    "positive @xmath22 thus represents a high energy density , i.e. , a probability distribution that assigns comparatively larger mass to graphs with high homomorphism density of @xmath18 , while negative @xmath22 is associated with a low energy density , whereby graphs with a large number of @xmath18 subgraphs have a smaller likelihood of being observed .",
    "correspondingly we say that the model ( [ pmf ] ) is `` attractive '' if the parameter @xmath22 is positive , and we say that it is `` repulsive '' if the parameter @xmath22 is negative . when @xmath22 is zero , the @xmath1-parameter exponential model reduces to the well - studied erds - rnyi random graph .    when studying the model , a natural question to ask is how different values of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 would impact the global structure of a typical random graph @xmath10 drawn from this model for large @xmath4 . chatterjee and diaconis @xcite showed that , as @xmath23 , when @xmath22 is positive or negative but with small magnitude , a random graph @xmath10 from would  look like \" an erds - rnyi random graph with high probability ( in a sense made precise in section [ graphon ] ) .",
    "they further demonstrated that , as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the model will begin to exhibit a peculiar extremal behavior , in the sense that a typical random graph from such a distribution will be close to a random subgraph of a complete multi - partite graph with the number of classes depending on the chromatic number of @xmath18 ( see section [ vertical ] for the exact statement of this result ) .",
    "below we will generalize the extremal results of @xcite and complete an exhaustive study of all the extremal properties of the exponential random graph when @xmath26 , i.e. , when @xmath18 is a triangle , which we will refer to as the edge - triangle model . identifying the extremal properties of the edge - triangle model is not only interesting from a mathematical point of view , but it also gives broad and fundamental insights into the expressive power of the model itself . in our framework , which is an extension of the one in @xcite , we will simultaneously let the size of the network @xmath4 grow unbounded and the natural parameters @xmath27 diverge along generic _ straight _ lines . in our analysis",
    "we will elucidate the relationship between all possible directions along which the natural parameters can diverge and the way the model tends to place most of its mass on graph configurations that resemble complete multi - partite graphs for large enough @xmath4 . as it turns out ,",
    "looking just at straight lines is precisely what is needed to categorize all extremal behaviors of the model .",
    "we summarize our contributions as follows .",
    "* we will extend the variational analysis technique of @xcite to show that the limiting set of the boundary of all extremal distributions of the edge - triangle model in our double asymptotic framework consists of degenerate distributions on all infinite dimensional turn graphs .",
    "we will further exhibit a partition of all the possible half - lines or directions in @xmath28 in the form of a collection of cones with apexes at the origin and disjoint interiors , so two sequences of natural parameters diverging along different half - lines in the same cone will yield the same asymptotic extremal behavior .",
    "we refer to this result as an asymptotic quantization of the parameter space of the edge - triangle model .",
    "we will finally identify a distinguished countable set of critical directions along which the extremal behaviors of the edge - triangle model can not be uniquely resolved . * in the second part of the paper , we will present a completely different technique of analysis that relies on the notion of closure of exponential families . within this second approach ,",
    "the extremal properties of the model correspond to the asymptotic boundary of the model in the total variation topology .",
    "the main advantage of this characterization is its ability to resolve the model also along critical directions .",
    "specifically , we will demonstrate that , along each such direction , the model undergoes , asymptotically , an unexpected phase transition , which we characterize as an asymptotic discontinuity in the natural parametrization .",
    "in contrast , in non - asymptotic regimes the natural parametrization is always continuous , even on the boundary of the total variation closure of the model . *",
    "a central ingredient of our analysis is the use of simple yet effective geometric arguments .",
    "both the quantization of the parameter space and the identification of critical directions stem from the dual geometric property of a bounded convex polygon with infinitely many edges , which can be thought of as an asymptotic mean value parametrization of the edge - triangle exponential model .",
    "we expect this framework to apply more generally to other exponential random graph models .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ limit ]",
    "we provide some basics of graph limit theory , summarize the main results of @xcite and introduce key geometric quantities . in section",
    "[ attractive ] we investigate the asymptotic behavior of `` attractive '' 2-parameter exponential random graph models along general straight lines . in section [ vertical ] we analyze the asymptotic structure of `` repulsive '' 2-parameter exponential random graph models along vertical lines . in sections",
    "[ jump ] and [ ale ] we examine the asymptotic feature of the edge - triangle model along general straight lines .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "all the proofs are in the appendix .",
    "below we will provide some background on the theory of graph limits and its use in exponential random graph models , focusing in particular on the edge - triangle model .",
    "a series of recent and fundamental contributions by mathematicians and physicists have led to a unified and elegant theory of limits of sequences of dense graphs , or graphons .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and the book @xcite for a comprehensive account and references .",
    "see also the related work on exchangeable arrays , where some of those results had already been derived : @xcite . the graphon framework has provided a new set of tools for representing and studying the asymptotic behavior of graphs , and has become the object of intense research in multiple fields , such as discrete mathematics , statistical mechanics and probability .",
    "here are the basics of this beautiful theory . according to the original definition of @xcite , a sequence @xmath29 of graphs , where we assume @xmath30 for each @xmath4 ,",
    "is said to converge when , for every simple graph @xmath8 , the limit as @xmath23 of the sequences of density homomorphisms of @xmath8 into @xmath10 exists , i.e. , when @xmath31 for some @xmath32 .",
    "the main result in @xcite is a complete characterization of all limits of converging graph sequences , which are shown to correspond to the functional space @xmath33 of all symmetric measurable functions from @xmath34 ^ 2 $ ] into @xmath34 $ ] , called _",
    "graph limits _ or _",
    "graphons_. specifically , the graph sequence @xmath35 converges if and only if there exists one graphon @xmath36 such that , for every simple graph @xmath8 with vertex set @xmath37 and edge set @xmath38 , @xmath39^{k}}\\prod_{\\{i , j\\}\\in e(h)}f(x_i , x_j)dx_1\\cdots dx_k.\\ ] ] intuitively , we may think of each graphon @xmath40 as arising in the following manner : the interval @xmath34 $ ] can be thought of as a continuum of vertices , and @xmath41 is the probability that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are connected by an edge .",
    "indeed , any finite graph @xmath10 has a natural representation as a graphon of the form @xmath44 in particular , for each finite simple graph @xmath8 , @xmath45 by definition .",
    "the theory of graph limits also covers sequences of random graphs , where the notions of convergence in probability and of weak convergence are well defined , as shown in @xcite .    among the main advantages of the graphon framework",
    "is its ability to represent the limiting properties of sequences of graphs , which are discrete objects , with an abstract functional space that is not only highly interpretable but also enjoys nice analytic properties .",
    "for example , for a sequence of erds - rnyi random graphs with constant edge probability @xmath46 , the limiting graphon is the function that is identically equal to @xmath46 on @xmath34 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "similarly , the sequence of turn graph with @xmath47 classes converges to a graphon that takes the value @xmath48 everywhere except along @xmath47 diagonal squares , where it is zero ( see ) .",
    "more importantly perhaps , lovsz and szegedy @xcite have shown that the space of graphons can be endowed with a particular metric , called the _ cut metric _",
    ", such that convergence of subgraph densities is equivalent to convergence in the cut metric . formally , for any two graphons @xmath40 and @xmath49 , define on @xmath33 the cut distance as @xmath50}\\left|\\int_{s\\times t}\\left(f(x , y)-g(x , y)\\right)dxdy\\right|,\\ ] ] where the supremum is over all measurable subsets @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "a non - trivial technical complication is the fact that the topology induced by the cut metric is well defined only up to measure preserving transformations ( and up to sets of lebesgue measure zero ) , which in the context of finite graphs can be thought of as vertex relabeling .",
    "the solution is to work instead on an appropriate quotient space @xmath53 .    to that end , define on @xmath33 the equivalence relation @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 if @xmath56 for some measure preserving bijection @xmath57 of @xmath34 $ ]",
    ". let @xmath58 denote the closure of the orbit @xmath59 of @xmath49 in @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath61 is invariant under @xmath57 , one can then define the natural distance @xmath62 between graphons by @xmath63 , where the infimum ranges over all measure preserving bijections @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( the infimum is always achieved : see theorem 8.13 in @xcite ) . with some abuse of notation we will also refer to @xmath62 as the cut distance .",
    "finally , the metric space @xmath66 is obtained by identifying two graphons @xmath40 and @xmath49 such that @xmath67 .",
    "lovsz and szegedy @xcite have showed that convergence of all graph homomorphism densities is equivalent to convergence in @xmath66 : a sequence of ( possibly random ) graph @xmath68 converges to a graphon @xmath40 if and only if @xmath69 where @xmath70 is defined in . the space @xmath66 enjoys many nice properties that are essential for the study of exponential random graph models . in particular , it is a compact space and homomorphism densities @xmath71 are continuous functionals on it .    as a final but important remark",
    ", it is worth emphasizing that graphons describe limits of _ dense _ graphs , i.e. , graphs having order @xmath72 edges .",
    "in particular , graphons can not describe or discern any graph property in the sequence that depends on a number of edges of order @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , for instance , sequences of graphs with order @xmath73 edges will trivially converge to the identically zero graphon . by the same token",
    ", any sequence of graphs that differ from another sequence converging to the graphon @xmath40 by @xmath73 edges will also converge to the same graphon .      in a recent important paper , diaconis and chatterjee",
    "@xcite examined the properties of the metric space @xmath66 in order to describe the asymptotic behavior of exponential random graph models . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "two results from @xcite are particularly significant . the first result , which is an application of a deep large deviation result of @xcite , is theorem 3.1 in @xcite .",

    "then , the quotient image @xmath79 of a random graph @xmath10 drawn from ( [ pmf ] ) must lie close to @xmath78 with probability vanishing in @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath80    due to its complicated structure , the variational problem ( [ setmax ] ) is not always explicitly solvable , and so far major simplification has only been achieved when @xmath22 is positive or negative with small magnitude .",
    "it has been discovered in chatterjee and diaconis @xcite that for @xmath22 lying in these parameter regions , @xmath10 behaves like an erds - rnyi graph @xmath81 in the large @xmath4 limit , where @xmath82 is picked randomly from the set @xmath83 of maximizers of a reduced form of ( [ setmax ] ) : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of edges in @xmath86 .",
    "( there are also related results in hggstrm and jonasson @xcite and bhamidi et al . @xcite . )",
    "some features of the exponential random graph models that remain unexplored are their extremal asymptotic properties , i.e. , their large sample behaviors when the natural parameters are large in magnitude . for the @xmath1-parameter exponential random graph models , chatterjee and diaconis @xcite studied the case in which @xmath17 and @xmath18 is arbitrary",

    "as we remarked in the discussion following theorem [ thm.at ] , our method of proof , largely based on and inspired by the results in @xcite , does not seem to suggest a way of clarifying this issue . in the next section we will consider an alternative asymptotic framework yielding different types of converge guarantees that will not only conform to the results of theorem [ main ] , but",

    "in the remainder part of this paper we will present an alternative analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the edge - triangle model using directly the properties of the exponential families and their closure in the finite @xmath4 case instead of the variational approach of @xcite . though the results in this section are seemingly similar to the ones in section [ mei ] , we point out that there are marked differences . first",
    ", while in section [ mei ] we study convergence in the cut metric for the quotient space @xmath53 , here we are concerned instead with convergence in total variation of the edge and triangle homomorphism densities .",
    "secondly , the double asymptotics , in @xmath4 and in the magnitude of @xmath215 , are not the same . in section [ mei ] , the system size @xmath4 goes to infinity first followed by the divergence of the parameter @xmath22 to positive or negative infinity .",
    "in contrast , here we first let the magnitude of the natural parameter @xmath215 diverge to infinity so as to isolate a simpler  restricted \" edge - triangle , and then study its limiting properties as @xmath4 grows .",
    "though both approaches are in fact asymptotic , we characterize the latter as  finite @xmath4 \" , to highlight the fact that we are not working with a limiting system and because , even with finite @xmath4 , the extremal properties already begin to emerge . despite these differences , the conclusions we can derive from both types of analysis are rather similar .",
    "furthermore , they imply a nearly identical convergence in probability in the cut topology ( see sections [ sec : cut.to.cut ] and [ sec : var.to.cut ] ) .",
    "besides giving a rather strong form of asymptotic convergence , one of the appeals of the finite @xmath4 analysis consists in its ability to provide a more detailed categorization of the limiting behavior of the model along critical directions using simple geometric arguments based on the dual geometry of @xmath99 , the convex hull of edge - triangle homomorphism densities .",
    "specifically , we will demonstrate that , asymptotically , the edge - triangle model undergoes phase transitions along critical directions , where its homomorphism densities will converge in total variation to the densities of one of two turn graphons , both of which are realizable .",
    "in addition we are able to state precise conditions on the natural parameters for such transitions to occur .",
    "we begin by reviewing some of the standard theory of exponential families and their closure in the context of the edge - triangle model .",

    "the interpretation of the parameter @xmath4 is immediate : it specifies the size of the network . while it may be tempting to regard @xmath4 as a surrogate for an increasing sample size , this would in fact be incorrect .",

    "indeed , for fixed @xmath4 , determining the limiting behaviors of the family @xmath225 along sequences of natural parameters @xmath231 for each unit norm vector @xmath227 and each @xmath215 is the main technical ingredient in computing the total variation closure of @xmath225 .",

    "this paper shows that asymptotically the `` repulsive '' edge - triangle exponential random graph model exhibits quantized behavior along general straight lines .",
    "as we continuously vary the slopes of these lines , a typical graph drawn from this model jumps from one complete multipartite graph to another , and the jumps happen precisely at the normal lines of a polyhedral set with infinitely many facets .",
    "there are two limit processes being considered here .",
    "first , the number of vertices of the random graph is tending to infinity , since it specifies the size of a large network .",
    "second , the energy parameter is tending to negative infinity , suggesting that the system is near the energy ground state .",
    "our results thus depict a large system that progressively transitions through finer and finer crystal structure at low energy density .    to verify these results ,",
    "we take two different approaches .",
    "the first one is a variational approach as in @xcite . in this approach",
    "we take the system size @xmath4 as infinite and examine the limiting behavior of the model as the energy parameter @xmath22 goes to negative infinity .",
    "this gives us the desired results along generic directions ( non - normal lines of the polytope ) , but is not quite as powerful along critical directions ( normal lines of the polytope ) , where it predicts that a typical graph is not unique but rather chosen by some unspecified distribution from two complete multipartite graphs .",
    "we then resort to a second approach , the finite @xmath4 analysis .",
    "we interchange the order of limits in this approach : the parameter @xmath228 ( which quantifies the magnitude of @xmath22 ) goes to infinity first followed by the growth of the system size @xmath4",
    ". even though the asymptotics considered in these two approaches are not exactly the same , the findings are almost identical , except that the first approach leaves some ambiguity over the smoothness of the transition along critical directions due to the unspecified limiting probability distribution ( as per theorem 3.2 in @xcite ) , while the second approach provides a deterministic result along critical directions and shows that the limiting behavior of the model depends on the natural parametrization in a discontinuous manner .",
    "we have adopted different notations for these two approaches . in the variational analysis",
    ", we take the straight line as @xmath370 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are fixed constants ( corresponding to slope and intercept of the line , respectively ) and @xmath22 decays to negative infinity . in the finite @xmath4 analysis",
    ", we represent the straight line in vector format @xmath371 , where @xmath215 and @xmath227 are fixed vectors in @xmath372 and @xmath228 diverges to infinity .",
    "the slope - intercept form is well suited for the infinite dimensional calculation ( see section [ mei ] ) , and the vector format is more natural for the finite dimensional calculation ( see section [ ale ] ) , where the geometry plays a bigger role in the proofs , so we keep them separate .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to point out that there is a natural correspondence between these two formulations : the slope @xmath148 corresponds to the direction @xmath227 and the intercept @xmath149 corresponds to the initial value @xmath215 .",
    "for both infinite and finite dimensional calculations , the structure of the graph is mainly determined by @xmath148 . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath148 is associated with generic directions ( non - normal lines ) , or equivalently , @xmath201 ( see theorem [ main ] ) , @xmath149 does not matter ( see theorem [ thm : main.2 ] ) .",
    "but when @xmath148 is associated with critical directions @xmath135 ( normal lines ) , or equivalently , @xmath196 ( see theorem [ main ] ) , @xmath149 plays a critical role .",
    "@xmath373 corresponds to @xmath215 in @xmath374 or @xmath279 , and so a typical graph is @xmath200-partite , while @xmath163 corresponds to @xmath215 in @xmath375 , and so a typical graph is @xmath202-partite ( see theorem [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "we see that finite dimensional analysis ( though only completely rigorous for certain @xmath4 s ) provides supporting evidence for the variational analysis .",
    "our focus is on the `` repulsive '' 2-parameter exponential random graph model , but the quantized behavior discovered in the repulsive region may be extended to the attractive region also . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the `` attractive '' 2-parameter exponential random graph model contains a continuous curve across which the graph exhibits jump discontinuity in density . for large and positive values of @xmath22",
    ", this curve asymptotically approaches the straight line @xmath174 . as @xmath22 varies from below the curve to above the curve , the model transitions from being a very sparse graph to a very dense ( nearly complete ) graph , completely skipping all intermediate structures .",
    "theorems [ thm.at ] and [ thm : main.3 ] capture this intriguing behavior .",
    "lastly , we would like to state that we do not actually need the exact expressions of the lower boundary of homomorphism densities ( the razborov curve ) to derive our results , all we need is its strict concavity . according to bollobs @xcite",
    ", the vertices of the convex hull @xmath99 for @xmath89 and @xmath376 , not just @xmath89 and @xmath90 as in the edge - triangle case , are given by the limits of complete @xmath47-equipartite graphs .",
    "more general conjectures of the limiting object @xmath99 may be found in @xcite .",
    "similar asymptotic quantization phenomenon is thus expected for more generic `` repulsive '' models .",
