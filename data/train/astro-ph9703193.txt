    "a few supernovae have been detected as sources of soft x - ray emission in the first decades after the supernova event ( canizares kriss & feigelson 1982 ; tanaka 1989 ; gorenstein , hughes & tucker 1994 ; bregman & pildis 1992 ; ryder _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; zimmerman , _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; tanaka 1993 ; fabian & terlevich 1996 ) .",
    "all of the detected sources are associated with type ii supernovae and , judging from radio observations , the most x - ray luminous of these appear to have had extensive circumstellar winds ( schlegel 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the interaction between the shock wave generated by the supernova with a dense circumstellar environment is expected to produce both soft x - ray emission and synchrotron radio emission ( chevalier 1982 ; chevalier & fransson 1994 , hereafter cf ) .",
    "there are two competing models for the production of this soft x - ray emission ; here we present observations that help to discriminate between the two models and define the constraints for further model development .",
    "type ii supernovae are associated with massive stars that , during their supergiant phase , drove slow , dense winds prior to the supernova event .",
    "if the wind material is smoothly distributed , the exploded star will drive a fast high temperature shock ( the blast shock ) into the wind , with velocities of 10,000 - 20,000 @xmath2 and temperatures of @xmath3 .",
    "also , a relatively slow shock ( the reverse shock ) propagates back into the stellar envelope at a velocity of 500 - 1000 @xmath2 relative to the expanding ejecta .",
    "this relatively mild shock - deceleration of the stellar envelope produces @xmath4 gas that can account for the soft x - ray emission detected with x - ray telescopes .",
    "little x - ray radiation emerges from the dilute @xmath3 gas behind the blast shock , although particle acceleration in the shocked shell can produce non - thermal radio emission ( chevalier 1982 ; cf ) .    the situation can be substantially different if either the circumstellar wind material or the exploded stellar envelope is highly clumped .",
    "the case of a highly clumped circumstellar wind has been studied by chugai ( 1993 ) and applied to sn 1986j .",
    "his study was motivated by the observation of narrow balmer emission lines ( @xmath5 ; leibundgut et al .",
    "1991 ) in the optical spectrum of sn 1986j .",
    "this observation was surprising since hydrogen emission lines are usually identified with the outer part of the exploded star , which for sn 1986j , is expanding at @xmath610,000 @xmath2 ( based upon its age and radio vlbi size ; bartel , rupen , and weiler 1989 ) .",
    "chugai ( 1993 ) proposed that the progenitor wind was clumpy and that the narrow emission lines and the soft x - ray emission originate in the wind clumps or clouds . in this model ,",
    "the reverse shock is too weak to produce observable soft x - rays .",
    "rather , it is the pressure in the strongly shocked wind that crushes the embedded clouds , driving shocks into the clouds .",
    "the observed soft x - rays are produced by radiative cooling of shocked cloud material , and the balmer emission is produced when these soft x - rays are reprocessed in the cooler cloud material .",
    "the inertia of the clouds is so great that they are not accelerated outward when the blast shock passes over them , so the fwhm of the optical emission lines reflects only the speed of the shock driven into the clouds . because the reverse shock model predicts x - ray lines of order 10,000 @xmath2 wide , the line widths of the x - ray emission lines , which can be observed with _",
    "asca _ , can be a powerful discriminator between the reverse shock model and model of chugai ( 1993 ) .",
    "x - ray emission in young supernovae has been observed in only a few cases ( sn 1978k , 1980k , 1986j , 1987a , 1988z , 1993j , and 1995n ) , and of these , only two are bright enough to obtain both spectra and fluxes : sn 1986j and 1993j .",
    "sn1986j , in the nearby edge - on spiral galaxy ngc 891 , was first discovered in the radio ( rupen et al .",
    "1987 ) and is one of the closest recent supernovae . because of its large radio luminosity , sn1986j is thought to have had a progenitor red supergiant star with an unusually dense wind ( weiler , panagia , and sramek 1990 ) and was predicted to be luminous in soft x - rays ( chevalier 1987 ) .",
    "an august 1991 _ pspc _ observation ( bregman and pildis 1992 ) confirmed that it is x - ray luminous .",
    "based on this _ pspc _ observation , the x - ray emission was characterized by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and an absorbing column of @xmath9 .",
    "because of the high absorption column , most of the photons were removed from the low energy band of the _ rosat _  _ pspc _ so that the received x - ray photons fell into a very limited energy range ( 0.7 - 2 kev ) , and the temperature and luminosity were poorly determined .",
    "nevertheless , these _ pspc _ measurements , when combined with radio data , gave a consistent fit to the reverse shock model ( cf ) .",
    "four new observations were obtained during the past five years : a second _ rosat _ _ pspc _ observation , a _",
    "rosat _ _ hri _ observation , and two _ asca _ observations .",
    "the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations provide clear evidence of dimming while the _ asca _ observations determine the abundance , temperature , and line width of the x - ray emitting material . here ,",
    "we present these recent observations and compare these new results with the theoretical expectations for the competing models .",
    "the first observation of sn 1986j , obtained on august 18 , 1991 ( as part of ao1 ) , consists of 24.9 ksec of live time data , which included some periods where the background was more than twice the modal background level ; nearly all of the higher background levels are identified with scattered solar x - rays .",
    "we discarded observing periods when the background exceeded 1.7 times the modal background value , which yielded a remaining live time of 17.1 ksec . in the initial analysis of these data ( bregman and pildis 1992 ) ,",
    "no data were discarded , but the difference in spectral fits and fluxes between the two types of analysis are insignificant .",
    "the second observation of sn 1986j was obtained 23 months later , during the period july 8 - 27 , 1993 ( as part of ao4 ) , and consists of 31.5 ksec of useful observing time .",
    "there are no periods during which the background became high relative to the modal value of the background , so no data were excluded .",
    "the background , as well as being better behaved than the 1991 observations , has a lower mean value , so low intensity features , such as those associated with the diffuse galactic emission , are seen at a higher signal - to - noise level ( bregman & houck 1996 ) .    at the resolution of the _ pspc _ , the emission from sn 1986j is contaminated by a weaker nearby source and by the diffuse galactic emission .",
    "this weaker source is visible in the _ pspc _ image in that it causes a distortion in the shape of the emission from sn 1986j ( fig .",
    "[ pspc - images]a , [ pspc - images]b ) , but in the _ hri _ image ( fig .",
    "[ hri - image ] ) , the two sources are clearly separated , with the weaker source 27.7 to the north and 0.4 to the east ( this source will be referred to as xnorth in the tables ) . in the extraction of _ pspc _ fluxes for sn 1986j , we fit point sources to the data , where the point spread function ( psf ) is approximated by a gaussian profile and the relative source separation is given by the _",
    "hri _ positions .",
    "the amplitude of the two gaussians was varied until the remaining residuals were similar to those expected from photon noise and where the emission from the underlying galaxy was approximately continuous ( the galaxy contribution is small ) .",
    "the resulting count rates for sn 1986j and source xnorth are listed in table [ rosat - table ] .",

    "this background includes the diffuse emission from the galaxy , which should improve the accuracy of the resultant spectra , although the number of background photons is not large in the 25 diameter aperture .",
    "the 25 aperture used encircles 91% of photons from the supernova ( at 1 kev ) , and the use of larger apertures lowered the s / n of the spectrum ( the background was increased ) without changing the results of the spectral analysis .",
    "a single - temperature thermal plasma model ( a `` raymond - smith '' plasma ) provides a successful fit to the data .",
    "based solely on the _ pspc _ data , there are two regions of temperature-@xmath16 space that produce equally acceptable spectral fits , a low temperature ( 0.2 - 1 kev ) high @xmath16 region ( log @xmath16 = 22.0 - 22.5 ) and a higher temperature ( 1 - 10 kev ) lower @xmath16 region ( log@xmath16 = 21.5 - 21.9 ) .",
    "this degeneracy is broken by the _",
    "asca_data , which reveal that the lower column , higher temperature solution is the correct one , and this is the one that will be discussed .",
    "the pulse - height spectra from the two periods are quite similar and there was no statistically significant change in the acceptable spectral fits .",
    "however , there is an indication that @xmath16 has decreased between 1991 and 1993 , as seen in the @xmath17 grids ( fig .",
    "[ conf - contours]a and fig . [ conf - contours]b ) . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we adopted two spectral models that give good fits to the two spectra in order to make comparisons of flux and luminosity .",
    "the two fits have cosmic abundance and log@xmath16 = 21.7 , t = 2.0 kev , which is within the 1% contour for each model ( table [ rosat - table ] ) , and log@xmath16 = 21.65 , t = 5.0 kev , which is about at the 95% confidence contour , and represents a higher temperature case .",
    "however , the difference in the absorption corrected flux and the luminosity ( columns 6 and 7 in table [ rosat - table ] ) were insignificant so only the results of the 2 kev model are shown in table [ rosat - table ] .",
    "the _ hri _ observations were obtained during 26 jan 1995 to 4 feb 1995 for a total useful exposure time of 97.17 ksec .",
    "the background was well - behaved during the observation and the image clearly shows the supernova and the source to the north ( fig .",
    "[ hri - image ] ) . other lower - level emission due to the galaxy can be extracted from the data and are discussed in bregman & houck ( 1996 ) .",
    "the count rate was determined within a circle of 13 radius , which encircles 90% of the photons from a point source ; a 10% correction was applied to compensate for the scattered photons . for the determination of the flux and luminosity",
    ", we adopted the same spectrum used for _ pspc _ spectral analysis ( log@xmath16 = 21.7 , t = 2.0 kev ) .",
    "the clearest difference between the observations is that there has been a significant decrease in the count rate , flux , and luminosity over a three and a half year period .",
    "the supernova event probably occurred in the last half of 1982 or the first few months of 1983 , so if we assume that the event occurred in 1983.0 , then the first _",
    "observation occurred 8.63 years after the sn event , the second _ pspc _ observation occurred 10.61 after the sn and the last _ rosat _ observation was obtained when the remnant was 12.08 years old .",
    "the time variation is decreasing approximately as @xmath18 , based upon these three measurements ( fig .",
    "[ light - curve ] ) , although with only three points , the form of the dimming is not well - established .",
    "sn1986j was observed by _ asca _ during 1994 january 21 - 22 and again during 1996 january 30 - 31 .",
    "standard criteria were used to exclude data taken during high noise conditions , especially those taken in close proximity to the south atlantic anomaly and other regions of low geomagnetic rigidity , and those taken when the line of sight to the supernova lay too close to the limb of the earth .",
    "we excluded _ gis _",
    "data taken while the ambient magnetic rigidity was less than 6 gev / c and when the elevation angle above the limb of the earth was less than 5 degrees . for the _ sis _ instruments , the cutoff values were 6 gev / c and 10 degrees ( 20 degrees for the bright earth ) , respectively .",
    "charged particle events were excluded from the _ sis _ data by retaining only _ sis _ events with grade 0,2,3 and 4 .",

    "based on a crude model for the radio light curves of sn 1986j , chevalier ( 1987 ) estimated a value of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the progenitor mass loss rate in units of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the wind velocity in units of 10 @xmath2 , and an explosion date in late 1982 .",
    "this model led to the prediction of x - ray emission from the reverse shock front with a luminosity @xmath74 and a temperature of @xmath75 k. these predictions were roughly verified by bregman & pildis ( 1992 ) . a more detailed model for the radio emission by weiler , panagia , & sramek ( 1990 ) led to @xmath76 and an explosion time in late 1982",
    "however , this model did involve assumptions about a mixed absorbing / emitting region and the temperature of the surrounding wind is a factor in determining the circumstellar density from the radio light curves ( lundqvist & fransson 1988 ) , so this value for @xmath77 is uncertain .",
    "cf present details for 2 circumstellar interaction models with @xmath78 at an age of 10 years .",
    "the red supergiant model has @xmath79 , but a temperature of only @xmath80 k because of the steep density gradient ; the shock wave is radiative . the power law model ( @xmath81 )",
    "has a lower luminosity by a factor of 2 , but the temperature is about @xmath82 k ; the shock wave became adiabatic at an age of 0.1 yr .",
    "in the first case , the luminosity scales roughly as @xmath83 and the second as @xmath84 provided the adiabatic assumption remains applicable .",
    "the observed temperature suggests that something like the power law case ( i.e. a relatively flat density profile ) is more relevant to sn 1986j , but with a higher value of @xmath83 .",
    "the current x - ray observations point to a value of @xmath77 of a few .",
    "a problem with the reverse shock model was raised by chugai ( 1993 ) , who noted that the vlbi observations of bartel , rupen , & shapiro ( 1989 ) imply an average velocity of 13,000 km s@xmath85 .",
    "the problem is that an object with typical supernova parameters expanding into the dense medium discussed above would be decelerated to considerably lower velocities .",
    "although chugai ( 1993 ) considers a particular supernova density profile with @xmath81 , it seems that the argument is widely valid .",
    "the 2 models of cf discussed above have peak ejecta velocities of 4300 km s@xmath85 and 5000 km s@xmath85 , respectively , at an age of 10 years . with the higher circumstellar density inferred for sn 1986j",
    ", the velocities would be even lower . however , the vlbi image produced by bartel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) in late 1988 shows that the source has a complex structure ; it is made up of an incomplete shell with several protrusions .",
    "the angular diameter across the peak brightness of the shell is about 1.6 milliarcsec . at an age of 6 years",
    ", this corresponds to a radial velocity of 6,300 km s@xmath85 .",
    "the origin of the protrusions is not certain , but the simulations of blondin , lundqvist , & chevalier ( 1996 ) show that protrusions can develop if there is an angular density gradient in some direction .",
    "protrusions would develop most naturally along one axis , which is not the case for sn 1986j , but the simulations do show the possibility of forming the required protrusions .",
    "to be more specific , we consider the power law density profile models discussed in section 2 of cf .",
    "we take @xmath76 ( weiler et al . 1990 and the above discussion of x - ray luminosity ) and @xmath86 in order to maximize the reverse shock gas temperature . the reference density , @xmath87 , is defined to be the density at a velocity of @xmath88 and age of 1 year , and can be @xmath89 for a low mass explosion .",
    "then , at @xmath90 yr , the outer shock velocity is @xmath91 , which corresponds to an average shock velocity of @xmath92",
    ". the average velocity in the shell would be somewhat lower than this and in accord with the vlbi shell velocity . at @xmath93 yr ( late 1992 )",
    ", the outer shock velocity is @xmath94 , which leads to a post - reverse shock temperature of @xmath95 k. this temperature is somewhat lower than the observed one , but the outer shock should have a temperature of @xmath96 k. this component should have a lower luminosity than the cool component , although nonequilibrium effects could give rise to enhanced line emission .",
    "it is also possible that the supernova density profile is complex and the shock front is in a particularly flat section .    in this model ,",
    "the reverse shock makes a transition from radiative to non - radiative at an age of about 2 years . at the time of the observations",
    ", the x - ray luminosity should tend to decrease as @xmath97 .",
    "the observed decline is steeper than this ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the steeper decline can be produced if the circumstellar density drops more rapidly than @xmath98 ( fransson , lundqvist , & chevalier 1996 ) .",
    "the very high circumstellar density deduced for sn 1986j suggests that it may be associated with a short - lived mass loss event prior to the supernova explosion .",
    "the circumstellar column density outside the outer shock front is @xmath99 at an age of 10 yr . because of the transition to an adiabatic shock wave and the low value of @xmath100 , the column density of cool gas behind the reverse shock front is probably less than this .",
    "the ability of this gas to absorb is further reduced by hydrodynamic instabilities . when the above value is compared to the observed values of @xmath16 , it is plausible that the circumstellar medium is a significant contributor to the total column density to the the supernova . in this model ,",
    "the circumstellar @xmath16 declines as @xmath101 .",
    "the reverse shock model is thus able to account for the general features of the observed x - ray emission , although it fails to reproduce some specific features .",
    "we have not pursued extensions of the model , such as the possibility of a density gradient dropping more rapidly than @xmath98 , because of the limited data that are available .",
    "in the alternative model of chugai ( 1993 ) , the x - ray emission is from shocked clouds .",
    "there is possible evidence for a clumpy circumstellar medium in that sn 1986j shows narrow hydrogen emission ; the fwhm of the h@xmath102 line corresponds to an expansion velocity of @xmath103 ( rupen et al .",
    "1987 ; leibundgut et al 1991 ) .",
    "however , the observed x - ray temperature requires a shock velocity of about @xmath104 , so that the same clouds can not be responsible for the optical and x - ray emission .",
    "the cloud model has many free parameters ( the cloud filling factor , density contrast , size , and the variation of these with radius ) , so it is likely that a model fit can be obtained ; it is the uniqueness of the model that is in question .",
    "there is the possibility of observationally distinguishing the models because the cloud model involves expansion velocities about a factor 3 smaller than those in the reverse shock model . in both cases ,",
    "the emission from the receding gas is absorbed by the supernova , so that the observed emission is primarily blueshifted .",
    "our measurement of the gaussian line width @xmath105 corresponds to a 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath106 fwhm .",
    "unfortunately , this limit is too weak to distinguish between the two models , but future x - ray missions , such as _ axaf _ , may be able to provide an answer .",
    "although our x - ray light curve so far has only a few points , the light curve is the least ambiguous piece of evidence because the high resolution observations give us a high degree of confidence that the light curve is not seriously contaminated by emission from nearby x - ray sources .",
    "in contrast , the interpretation of the _ asca _ spectra is somewhat unclear because of the significant level of contamination from other sources of x - ray emission in the field of view , and in particular from point sources in the disk and diffuse emission from the halo of ngc891 . despite the lack of information on the spectral characteristics of the contaminating sources",
    ", we can estimate the relative contributions from each source .",
    "the diffuse emission from the x - ray halo is quite soft , with @xmath107 , and contributes around 40% of the flux below about 1 kev . while the spectra of the point sources in the disk are unknown , the change in 2 - 10 kev flux observed from 1994 jan to 1996 jan is consistent with the supernova dominating the emission in this band .",
    "x - ray bright supernovae like sn1986j appear to be relatively rare ( houck & bregman 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , this object represents an excellent opportunity to study the physics of an extreme example of the interaction of a supernova with a dense circumstellar environment and we hope to continue monitoring x - ray emission from sn1986j as long as possible . despite the relatively rapid decline in x - ray luminosity , future high spatial resolution observations with _",
    "rosat _ and _ axaf _ should allow us to track the light curve and to follow changes in the spectrum for several years to come",
    ". observations with _",
    "should be particularly useful for providing high quality spectra and , thus , line widths .",
    "we would like to thank keith arnaud , ken ebisawa , and the _ asca_-_gof _ for their assistance with the _ asca_data analysis . financial support for this work was provided by nasa grants nagw-2135 , nagw-4448 , nag5 - 2732 , and nag5 - 3057 ."
