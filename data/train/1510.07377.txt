    "fractional diffusion models received considerable attention over the last two decades from both practical and theoretical point of view .",
    "researchers have found numerous porous media systems in which some key underlying random motion conform to a model where the diffusion is not classical , it is instead anomalously slow ( fractional subdiffusion ) or fast ( super - diffusion ) .",
    "for example , the fractional diffusion problem captures the dynamics of some subdiffusion processes , where the growth of the mean square displacement is slower compared to a gaussian process , see podlubny ( 1999 ) for more detail .",
    "the modeling of this problem is actually based on continuous time random walks and master equations with power law waiting time densities ( henry & wearne ( 2000 ) ) , where @xmath14 represents the probability density function for finding a particle at location @xmath20 and at time @xmath21 ( with waiting time and the jumps that are statistically independent ) .",
    "fractional diffusion models have been successfully used to describe diffusion in several phenomena including media with fractal geometry ( nigmatulin ( 1986 ) ) , highly heterogeneous aquifer ( adams & gelhar ( 1992 ) ) , and underground environmental problem ( hatano & hatano ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "many authors have proposed various techniques for approximating the solution @xmath14 of , however obtaining sharp error bounds under reasonable regularity assumptions on @xmath14 has proved challenging .",

    "the error analyses in most of these papers typically assume that the solution @xmath14 is sufficiently smooth , including at @xmath22 .",

    "variable time steps were employed to compensate the singular behavior of @xmath14 , and consequently maintain optimal order rates of convergence .",
    "our main aim is to propose and analyze a method using exact integration in time and finite volume ( fv ) method for the space discretization for the two - dimensional fractional model .",
    "then , we combine the fv scheme in space with a piecewise - linear time - stepping dg scheme which will then define a fully - discrete scheme .",
    "compared to finite differences and finite elements , fv method is easier to implement on structured as well as unstructured meshes and offers flexibility in tackling domains with complex boundaries .",
    "further , it ensures local conservation property of the fluxes which makes this method more attractive in applications .",
    "the approach followed here is to formulate the problem in the petrov - galekin frame using two different meshes to define the trial space and test space , see bank & rose ( 1987 ) , cai ( 1991 ) and sli ( 1991 ) for some earlier results in this direction .",

    "the major contribution of the present article can be summarized as follows .",
    "we first prove that , under certain regularity assumptions on @xmath14 of problem , the error of the fv approximation to the solution @xmath14 in the @xmath1-norm ( that is , @xmath25-norm ) converge with order @xmath26 , where @xmath4 is the maximum diameter of the elements of the spatial mesh ; see theorem [ h2 ] .",
    "the imposed regularity conditions on @xmath14 can be satisfied by imposing some compatibility conditions on the given data taking into consideration that the derivative of @xmath14 is not bounded near @xmath27 , see the discussion after theorem [ h2 ] .",
    "in addition , under more restrictive regularity assumptions , we show errors of order @xmath26 in the stronger @xmath28-norm , see theorem [ sup - conv-2 ] . since in the limiting case @xmath29 the problem reduces to the classical heat problem , these convergence results extend those obtained in chatzipantelidis et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2009 ) and chou & li ( 2000 ) for the heat equation .",
    "this extension is indeed not straightforward , we make the full use of several important properties of the fractional derivative operator and also use clever steps ( see for instance the proof of lemma [ sup - conv-1 ] ) to achieve our goal . in the second part of the paper",
    ", we derive the error from the fully - discrete scheme ( dg in time and fv in space ) for .",
    "in the @xmath1-norm , we show convergence of order @xmath30 ( that is , suboptimal in time ) where @xmath5 is the maximum time step - size . proving this rate of convergence in the stronger @xmath28-norm is beyond the scope of the paper due to several technical difficulties .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the numerical results demonstrate optimal convergence rate in both time and space in the @xmath28-norm , and also shows that the regularity conditions on @xmath14 are pessimistic . in this regard ,",
    "the approach used in the time - stepping dg error analysis in mustapha ( 2015 ) might be beneficial to prove a better convergence rate in time , @xmath31 instead of @xmath32 .",
