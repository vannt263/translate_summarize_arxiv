    "these calculations have been done by changing every time the parameters of the force ( [ sofin ] ) to reproduce the 6.3 mev splitting between the protons 1p levels in @xmath57o .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 was fixed to the arbitrary value of 1.2 @xmath66 and the fit of the splitting was obtained by changing @xmath67 .",

    "the three interactions do not differ very much as it is shown in the panel i of the figure .",
    "this result indicates that the largest contribution from the spin ",
    "orbit force is coming from the @xmath62 factor of the direct term .",
    "since the other terms are small we have explored the possibility of avoiding their explicit calculation by simulating their effects with a readjustment of the force parameters .",
    "this is the reason why each type of calculation has been done with a different parametrization of the force , each of them reproducing the same empirical quantity .    in tab .",
    "[ be ] we compare the binding energies obtained with our calculations with the experimental ones @xcite . in spite of the fact that we handle with a non  linear problem , the spin  orbit terms acts on the binding energies as expected .",

    "clearly those nuclei where not all the spin ",

    "the splittings obtained with the zero range interaction @xmath55 become larger than those obtained with finite range interaction as the mass number of the nucleus increases .",
    "the results obtained with zero  range skyrme interaction do not present this effect . in the skyrme interaction",
    "there are velocity dependent terms generating spin  orbit like contributions which add to those produced by the genuine spin  orbit term .",
    "these velocity dependent terms simulate the effects of the finite range .",
    "we observe that the value of the splittings obtained with the skyrme iii interaction are comparable with those obtained with our finite range interactions .",

    "[ tz1 ] and [ tz2 ] we infer information on the role of the terms @xmath24 in eq .",

    "the inclusion of @xmath24 increases the splitting for all the nuclei considered but the magnitude of this increase is rather different for the various nuclei .",
    "we should not consider in our analysis the nucleus @xmath57o since it has been used to fit the interaction .",
    "we notice that the addition of @xmath24 produces quite small differences in the splitting of @xmath58ca and @xmath60pb nuclei while they are remarkable in @xmath56c and @xmath59ca .",
    "these results can be understood by considering that @xmath24 is related to the nuclear spin density , eq .",
    "( [ lsden ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the radial wave functions @xmath71 are the same for spin  orbit partners levels , the contribution of these two levels to the spin density is exactly zero . in real calculations these wave functions are slightly different , but",
    "the contribution to the spin density remains small .",
    "this explains the small increase of the splitting in @xmath58ca and the relatively large modifications produced in @xmath56c and @xmath59ca .",
    "one should remark that only the unoccupied levels contribute to the spin density .",
    "for this reason the effect of @xmath24 is relatively large with respect to that of @xmath72 in @xmath56c and @xmath59ca where the number of single particle levels is relatively small . in a heavy nucleus like @xmath60pb",
    "there are many levels contributing in @xmath73 and the effects of @xmath24 produced by a single level is relatively small .",
    "the contribution of the exchange term can be seen by comparing the results of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 columns .",
    "the variations with respect to the calculations done with only the direct terms can be as big as 10 - 15% , but not all of them have the same sign .",
    "it seems that for all the @xmath74 states the splitting is reduced when the exchange term is considered , but it is increased in the @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 states .",
    "the situation for the @xmath63 states is even more complicated , since the splitting is reduced for the @xmath78 states in @xmath60pb but it has increased for all the other @xmath63 states .",
    "the contribution of the exchange term can not be taken into account in calculations with the direct term only by modifying the force parameters .",
    "the values of the splittings produced by the urbana ( u ) , and argonne v@xmath79 interactions are comparable with those of our interactions , while the argonne v@xmath80 ( a14 ) generates smaller values .",
    "the radial dependence of the spin ",
    "orbit terms of these interactions are shown in the panel ii of the figure .",
    "it is remarkable that the results of u and a18 are similar in spite of the large difference in the depth .",
    "the depth value of a14 is intermediate between those of the previous two forces , but its splittings are smaller .",
    "th u and a18 forces have similar range , while that of a14 is smaller .",
    "these facts indicate that our calculations are more sensitive to the range of the interaction than to its minimum value .",
    "in effect we recall that , in our calculations , a zero  range interaction does not produce any splitting .",
    "the calculations done with the microscopic interactions include both spin  orbit and spin  orbit isospin terms . in order to study the importance of the isospin part of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction we have repeated each calculation leaving out this terms .",
    "the differences of the results obtained with the full interaction and those without the isospin part are very small . in order to avoid a long list of numbers we give in tab .",
    "[ d3 ] , for each nucleus under investigation , the minimum , the maximum and the average difference , in absolute value , between the calculated splittings .",
    "it appears clear the relatively small importance of this term of the interaction .",
    "this fact can be understood considering that the major contribution to the spin ",
    "orbit interaction is coming from the direct @xmath23 term .",
    "for the spin - orbit isospin term of the interaction , the case @xmath81 , the @xmath23 term contains a function which is given by the difference between the proton and neutron density distributions , eq .",

    "in this article we have presented a formalism to treat finite range spin  orbit interactions in hf calculations .",
    "the finite range of the interaction generates additional terms with respect to the usual shell model expression .",
    "one of these is the contribution to the exchange fock ",
    "dirac term in the hf equation ( [ hf6 ] ) .",
    "also in the direct ( hartree ) term of this equation there is a new part : the @xmath82 piece of eq .",
    "( [ dls ] ) .",
    "the major goal of our work was the investigation of the effects produced by these new components .",
    "this has been done by adding different type of spin  orbit terms to a fixed interaction active only in the four central channels .",
    "we have used a spin  orbit interaction of a gaussian form whose parameters have been fixed to reproduce the energy splitting of the proton @xmath83 levels in @xmath57o .    we have shown that the largest part of the spin  orbit effects in hf calculations is produced by the traditional shell model term , @xmath84 in eq .",

    "the role of the exchange term is more complicated : its inclusion in the calculations modifies by a maximum of 15% the values of the spin  orbit splittings .",
    "the complication arises because these modifications do not have the same sign for all the nuclei studied . in calculations done with only the direct terms , it is not possible to simulate the exchange effects by simply readjusting the parameters of the interaction .    forcing our formalism to handle zero ",

    "traditional hf calculations use spin  orbit zero  range terms of skyrme type @xcite .",
    "these expressions produce contributions to the hamiltonian which are related to the derivative of the density distribution , while our expressions depend directly from the density distribution .",

    "we have done calculations with spin - orbit terms taken from microscopic interactions @xcite and we have obtained splittings close to those produced by our effective spin  orbit interactions .",
    "this would indicate that the medium does not affect the spin - orbit term of the realistic interaction , in agreement with the findings of g - matrix calculations @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out , however , that the observables we have investigated are more sensitive to the global properties of the spin - orbit potential than to its details .",
