    "parametric down - conversion is an important and versatile source of light .",
    "its applications span from amplification of laser pulses to creation of strictly quantum states in the form of entangled photon pairs and squeezed vacuum .",
    "as optical parametric amplifiers rely on nonresonant nonlinear interaction , they can be utilized to amplify extremely wide bandwidth pulses .",
    "one of the most appealing applications of this phenomenon is the optical parametric chirped pulse amplifier ( opcpa ) @xcite in which ultrashort pulses are stretched , amplified and then compressed again .",
    "the gain medium is typically pumped by a nanosecond second harmonic pulse from a q - switched laser .",
    "such amplifiers can provide a few femtosecond long multi - terawatt pulses @xcite .",
    "one of the most important and fundamental problems with this type of amplifiers is the presence of spontaneous parametric fluorescence , which unavoidably accompanies useful gain and compromises the pulse contrast ratio .",
    "this issue is central in many applications and has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "although the numerical results provided in @xcite are very accurate , they are based on langevin noise equations @xcite developed for a cavity parametric amplifier .",
    "consequently , the noise parameter has to rely on an experimental calibration .",
    "furthermore , their numerical character does not give direct guidelines for noise reduction .",
    "in this paper , we develop a simple analytical model of a 3d noncollinear optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) .",
    "we assume type - i noncollinear phase matching in a second - order nonlinear crystal pumped with a monochromatic gaussian beam . as a consequence , we are able to calculate the intensity of parametric fluorescence for any given signal gain , as well as its spatial and spectral distributions . moreover , we find the optimal seed mode and pump waist for which spontaneous fluorescence is minimal .",
    "our model is built around the bloch - messiah reduction @xcite of an optical parametric amplifier operated without pump depletion .",
    "it is a theorem which allows us to find a set of orthogonal , characteristic modes ( or eigenmodes ) of the amplifier and their respective gains . in the case of monochromatic pumping ,",
    "the modes are the input and output beam shapes of the signal and idler fields at any pair of frequencies matching up to the pump .",
    "the main feature of the reduction is that if the amplifier is seeded with a beam matching its characteristic input mode , then this beam is amplified by the associated gain factor and assumes the output characteristic shape on the other end of the amplifier .",
    "in addition , spontaneous parametric fluorescence is produced in all of the characteristic output modes and the number of photons scattered into each of those modes is equal to the gain of that mode . in particular ,",
    "the immediate conclusion from the reduction is that the optimal signal to parametric noise ratio is obtained when the seed beam has the shape of the fundamental input mode .",
    "the output of the amplifier may be spatially filtered to reject as many of the higher other modes as possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents general theory of parametric down - conversion , with emphasis on the 3d crystal pumped by a monochromatic wave .",
    "we introduce the bloch - messiah reduction theorem and discuss its general consequences .",
    "in section 3 we derivate the characteristic modes and their gains for two particular settings - noncollinear with no walk - off and noncollinear with a significant walk - off .",
    "section 4 summarizes the results of the analytical reduction . in section 5",
    "we compare analytical results with precise numerical calculations and discuss the accuracy of the approximations assumed .",
    "section 6 describes behavior of the parametric gain in the intense pumping regime , provides estimation of the fluorescence noise in practical situations and gives solutions for the noise reduction .",
    "finally , section 7 concludes the paper and gives insight into possible applications and extensions .",
    "we aim at investigating the properties of a 3d parametric amplifier pumped by a strong , monochromatic laser beam of frequency @xmath0 and diameter @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the signal and the spontaneous fluorescence fields are always so weak that they can not influence the evolution of the pump . within this approximation ,",
    "the nonlinear interaction with the pump field couples pairs of conjugate frequencies , commonly called signal @xmath2 and idler @xmath3 .",
    "let us note that any two adjacent frequencies @xmath4 evolve completely independently thanks to narrowband pumping . therefore , amplification of a broadband seed pulse can be calculated separately for each of its monochromatic components , which may enter the crystal at different angles @xcite . throughout the paper , we will analyze the interaction of a particular pair of frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath5 with the pump .",
    "we choose a coordinate system where the @xmath6 axis lies along the central @xmath7-vector of the pump @xmath8 and the crystal faces are perpendicular to this axis .",
    "then , it is most convenient to follow the convention of describing the evolution of the system as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "we expand the electric field of each of the interacting waves in the basis of monochromatic plane waves parameterized by frequency @xmath9 and perpendicular components of the wave vector @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath6-dependent frequency - space amplitude of the wave . with the above normalization @xmath14 is the photon density .      before analyzing a bulk amplifier let us briefly recall the basic concepts for a waveguide amplifier which can be reduced into a 2-mode amplifier for a defined signal frequency .",
    "this simple system will help in the comprehension of a full - fledged 3-d amplifier .",
    "later on , the bloch - messiah decomposition will allow us to simplify the 3-d amplifier to a set of independent 2-mode amplifiers .",
    "the pump field undergoes only dispersive evolution and its amplitude along the @xmath6 axis is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the pump wavenumber and @xmath17 is the initial amplitude .",
    "the evolution of the signal amplitude @xmath18 and the idler amplitude @xmath19 is described by the equations of motion @xcite @xmath20 the wave vectors for the signal and the idler are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is responsible for linear propagation .",
    "the second one describes the nonlinear interaction with the coupling constant @xmath23 .    for a waveguide which starts at @xmath24 and ends at @xmath25",
    "one can obtain the following input - output relations : @xmath26 the upper indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote positions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "phase terms with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 depend on wave vector matching and we skip their explicit form for brevity .",
    "the intensity gain of the amplifier equals @xmath35 , where the gain parameter @xmath36 is proportional to the pump amplitude @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to the amplified signal , the interaction produces spontaneous fluorescence .",
    "quantum - mechanical considerations @xcite show that the average number of photons generated this way equals @xmath37 .",
    "this system is called a 2-mode or nondegenerate parametric amplifier @xcite .",
    "if one needs to calculate the amplification of a realistic laser pulse , the pulse has to be decomposed into monochromatic waves via fourier transform , amplified as in ( [ eq : squeeze2mode ] ) and composed back .",
    "let us now switch to a bulk crystal with the length @xmath38 in the @xmath6 direction and infinite in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions .",
    "the pump @xmath41 , the signal @xmath42 and the idler @xmath43 amplitudes have spatial freedom which is encoded in their dependence on the spatial wave vector @xmath44 .",
    "the infinite transversal size of the crystal allows interaction only of those signal and idler components for which transverse wave vectors sum up to the pump s .",
    "therefore in each slice of the crystal with given @xmath6 only those interactions can take place , which preserve both the energy @xmath45 and the perpendicular components of the momentum @xmath46 using these principles , an equation of motion for the waveguide amplifier can be extended as follows @xmath47 as in the waveguide , the first term on the right hand side represent the dispersive propagation .",
    "the second term is responsible for nonlinear interactions involving all the possible planewave components fulfilling .",
    "the above equations are linear in the signal and idler amplitudes , and so are the input - output relations for the amplifier . formally , they can be written down using input - output relations with integral kernels ( or green functions ) @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 since the integral kernels describe a reversible process , they turn out to be interdependent .",
    "the bloch - messiah theorem @xcite relates their singular value decompositions ( svd ) : they have common modes and gain parameters , that is @xmath53 above , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the input signal modes , the output signal modes , the input idler modes and the output idler modes , respectively , while @xmath58 are their gain parameters .",
    "mathematically , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are four different sets of orthonormal functions .",
    "physically , they represent characteristic beam shapes in the far field .",
    "modes with different @xmath59 indices do not couple .",
    "more precisely , the input - output relations given by   can be brought to the canonical bloch - messiah form if we decompose the signal and the idler amplitudes in the bases of their characteristic modes @xmath60 substituting the above into and using we find that the whole opa can be decomposed into a set of independent 2-mode amplifiers @xmath61 where @xmath59 indexes subsequent independent modes , conventionally sorted by their gains .",
    "note that the above equations have the same form as the input - output relation for the waveguide 2-mode amplifier given in .",
    "similarly , the intensity gain of the @xmath59-th mode equals @xmath62 and the average number of the photons spontaneously scattered into that mode equals @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we are interested in finding the characteristic beam shapes @xmath54 , @xmath55 and gain parameters @xmath58 , as this will provide the complete information .",
    "in particular , seeding the amplifier with its fundamental mode @xmath64 would give us an advantage of obtaining maximal possible gain @xmath65 .",
    "the idea of the decomposition is illustrated in fig .",

    "in particular it allows us to deduce all the characteristic mode functions from the svd of @xmath51 .",
    "even though in and out modes are similar , the behavior inside the crystal may be complex .",
    "our description says nothing about what happens between the surfaces - we have only the input - output relations .",
    "the shape of the modes and their amplification vary in a number of parameters , including the crystal length @xmath38 .      in general the integral kernels defined in ( [ eq : squeezespatialmodes ] )",

    ", we need to integrate over @xmath75 with the zero - order approximation ( [ eq : freepropagation ] ) substituted on the right hand side . comparing the result to the definition of the integral kernels , we obtain @xmath76 in the first - order approximation the above functions describe only linear propagation . however , the remaining two kernels @xmath77 describe down - conversion and give us insight into the characteristic modes of the bloch - messiah reduction .",
    "we call @xmath78 the scattering kernel , as it describes amplitudes with which the incident signal creates the scattered idler beam .",

    "we know that the number of photons scattered into mode @xmath218 at a frequency of @xmath2 is equal to @xmath219 .",
    "when we observe the output of the amplifier through an aperture , the contributions of distinct modes should be added incoherently .",

    "with such a formulation , the pump intensity and the number of fluorescence photons emitted per unit time @xmath222 can become slowly varying time dependent quantities . however , let us focus on the simplest way of minimizing the total noise represented by the integral , that is minimizing the noise power at each frequency @xmath224 independently .",
    "we consider achieving this goal by spatial filtering of the output of the amplifier with an aperture .    as one",
    "my find in the gain parameters @xmath225 form geometric series with respect to both @xmath59 and @xmath226 as @xmath227 . for typical data ,",
    "@xmath158 is small and modes with @xmath228 can be neglected . on the other hand , @xmath186 is often close to 1 and spatial filtering in the angular direction can become necessary .",
    "this can be accomplished by imaging the crystal onto a suitably oriented slit .",

    "another approach to reducing fluorescence contained in high order modes is reducing angular gain decrement @xmath186 .",
    "our simplified model predicts that it would approach zero when the following relation holds between the crystal length and the pump beam waist @xmath237 naturally the above relation should be considered approximate , because it relies on the numerical factor used in sinc approximation .",
    "fortunately , even a rough fit to the ( [ eq : optimalpumpwidth ] ) should suffice .",
    "we have developed a simple analytical model of a noncollinear parametric amplifier pumped with a focused monochromatic beam and utilizing type i phase matching .",
    "we found an approximate bloch - messiah reduction for a low - gain parametric amplifier for an arbitrary pair of signal and idler frequencies .",
    "the final result was expressed in a closed form in two special cases : zero walk - off of the pump beam or total walk - off of the order of the beam size .",
    "characteristic modes of the first setting are optical vortices .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the typical experimental situation and we find that the characteristic modes are elliptic hermite - gaussian beams .",
    "we checked the validity of the approximations assumed during the derivation by comparing the analytical result to the numerical calculations for a typical range of parameters .",
    "finally , we scaled the results of the reduction to a high gain regime using the results of our previous work @xcite and we discussed how to calculate the gain and fluorescence intensity .    in particular , we have calculated the fundamental mode of the amplifier , which has turned out to be elliptic gaussian . seeding the amplifier with a beam matching this mode yields the highest possible amplification .",
    "the output of the parametric amplifier contains both the amplified seed beam and optical noise due to parametric fluorescence .",
    "the bloch - messiah reduction allows us to directly calculate the amount of parametric fluorescence emitted by the amplifier .",
    "further analysis shows that it can be reduced by either suitable spatial filtering of high - order modes or adjusting the pump beam diameter so that that those modes are suppressed .",
    "the results of our approximated model will never be as accurate as numerical simulations based on tracing the evolution of quasi - probability distributions @xcite , but they can be instantly calculated for various configurations of parametric amplifiers using the mathematica 6 script we provide online @xcite , and thus may provide valuable insight in the applications .    our results may be also used as a starting point for numerical code modeling opcpa with pump depletion .",
    "this would be accomplished by dividing the amplifier longitudinally into two parts : the front one , in which a gain of @xmath238@xmath239 is reached without depleting the pump , and the rear one , where saturation occurs . in the first part , quantum phenomena play a role , while in the second part spontaneous fluorescence can be treated as classical noise .",
    "the front part can be treated with our model . this way the optimal input seed beam shape and spatially resolved intensity of the parametric fluorescence",
    "can be obtained .",
    "the latter can serve as an initial condition for the numerical code solving the classical evolution of the fields in the rear part of the amplifier .",
    "the model developed in this paper may be also helpful for optimizing photon pair sources , since it represents an alternative approach to the problem of finding spatial modes of the parametric fluorescence and optimal fiber coupling @xcite ."
