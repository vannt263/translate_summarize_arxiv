    "the field of topological insulators is progressing extremely fast on both theoretical and experimental fronts and in the past few years it attracted an unprecedented attention from the condensed matter community .",
    "this expedited but self - contained review is concerned with a less studied aspect of the field , namely the effect of strong disorder on topological materials .",
    "a material is called topological insulator if it behaves like an insulator when probed deep into the bulk and as a metal when probed near any edge or surface cut into the material @xcite .",
    "this behavior is not triggered by any externally applied field and , instead , it is an intrinsic property of the material . for a topological insulator ,",
    "the metallic character of the edges or surfaces is robust against smooth deformations of the material , as long as the insulating character is maintained in the bulk of the material .",
    "examples of topological insulators are the chern and quantum spin - hall ( qsh ) insulators which will be extensively discussed later .    the idea behind this review was to bring the attention to a set of analytic tools developed for the integer quantum hall - effect ( iqhe ) by bellissard and his collaborators in the late 1980 s , reviewed in the excellent paper from 1994 @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , these analytic tools can be applied quite directly to many classes of topological insulators @xcite , therefore providing a natural theoretical framework to analytically treat the effect of strong disorder in topological materials ( for alternative approaches we point the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite ) . is the work by bellissard et al relevant to the field of topological insulators ?",
    "we think it is more than ever , at both conceptual and practical levels .",
    "it is important at the conceptual level because the main claim in the field of topological insulators is the robustness of the topological properties against disorder .",
    "this is a huge claim , holding a lot of promises as most of the newly envisioned applications are based on it .",
    "but to date , we are still missing the hard evidence for it , counting experiment , numerics and theory all together .",
    "the transport experiments on hgte / cdte quantum wells @xcite , the only 2d qsh insulator discovered to date , consistently showed a decrease of the conductance with the increase of separation between the ohmic contacts .",
    "the quantization of the conductance , as predicted by theory , was observed only for short contact distances of less than 1 micron ( one should be aware that hgte and cdte materials are extremely difficult to work with so it is hard to pinpoint the cause of this behavior ) . for 3d samples",
    ", angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements for disordered surfaces @xcite seem to indicate robust topological extended surface bands , but these conclusions need to be confirmed by transport measurements .",
    "the transport measurements in 3d topological samples have been notoriously difficult @xcite because of a metallic bulk .",
    "recent characterizations also showed that band bending near the crystal s surface can trap conventional 2d electron states that coexist but also mix with the topological surface states @xcite , making the experiments even harder .",
    "but most recently , high quality single crystals grown by molecular beam epitaxy have been reported @xcite ( see also the important new development in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . when properly doped , these crystals display insulating bulk @xcite and accurate transport measurements of the surface can be recorded .",
    "unfortunately , the first such transport measurements indicate that the topological surface states are slightly localized ( the localization is believed to be induced by inelastic scattering processes ) .",
    "@xcite also reported arpes measurements , which look very similar to the previously reported data @xcite , despite the fact that the surface states are localized .",
    "the character of the surface states has been also probed by stm measurements @xcite , which gave evidence that at short scales ( the  field of view \" of the stm is less than 1 @xmath0m@xmath1 ) the states are extended despite the presence of strong defects .",
    "shubnikov - de haas oscillation measurements , which allow one to map the fermi surface ( if any ) , gave an inconclusive picture so far , with few studies @xcite reporting clear signal coming from a metallic surface and another study @xcite , done with ultra high - quality crystals , reporting no significant contributions from the surface , implying an extremely low surface conductivity .",
    "the conclusion here is that the experimental measurements are converging to a point where the robustness against disorder can be rigorously tested but we do nt have yet the experimental confirmation of this property .    the number of existing numerical simulations for disordered topological insulators is quite small compared with the number of simulations done in the 80 s and 90 s for the anderson localization .",
    "until recently , there was only one short numerical study @xcite on the robustness of the bulk extended states in qsh insulators .",
    "this study used the transfer matrix analysis and was completed for small quasi - one dimensional samples .",
    "recently , the transfer matrix analysis was repeated for much larger systems in ref .",
    "@xcite , re - confirming the existence of robust extended bulk states against disorder in qsh insulators .",
    "this study seems to contain the most accurate computations to date .",
    "the transfer matrix analysis was also adopted in @xcite for a representative network model in the symplectic class , with emphasis on the critical exponents at the mobility edges .",
    "the properties of the bulk states in a 2d qsh insulator were also probed in ref .",
    "@xcite by computations of certain topological invariant in the presence of disorder ( the systems considered in this study are extremely small ) .",
    "same method was adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite for a 3d qsh insulator with disorder ( probably the first simulation in 3d ; also very small ) . ref .",
    "@xcite presented a level statistics analysis for chern insulators and computations of the chern number in the presence of disorder .",
    "the robustness of the edge states against disorder was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite by computing the landauer conductance for a disordered ribbon connected to clean leads .",
    "all these three studies worked with @xmath2 conserving models and were limited to small systems ( the length of the ribbons was about 200 lattice sites ; this number was @xmath3 in the transfer matrix computations of ref .",
    "@xcite ; we also want to mentioned that the theory of the edge states in @xmath2 conserving models with disorder is firmly established @xcite ) .",
    "but despite all these fine numerical simulations , we are still lacking systematic studies that combine more than one method and where the numerical convergence is rigorously analyzed . from our experience , we can attest that , no matter how elaborate these numerical experiments are , there will always be a margin of doubt about the localization - delocalization issues , until an analytic proof will be available .",
    "the non - commutative methods have also a great practical value . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the non - commutative formulas of the invariants can lead to extremely efficient numerical algorithms , allowing computations of the invariants in the presence of disorder for system sizes that are orders of magnitude larger that what was possible with more traditional methods @xcite .",
    "developing accurate and efficient methods for mapping the phase diagram of disordered topological insulators is extremely important for practical applications especially that , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the phase diagram of a topological insulator can be strongly deformed by the presence of disorder .",
    "there are additional reasons for writing this review . by its very nature",
    ", the field of topological insulators can lead to an unprecedented cross fertilization between condensed matter physics and various fields in pure mathematics with tremendous potential benefits for both fields .",
    "we have already seen applications from classic topology @xcite , chern - simons theory @xcite , conformal field theory , k - theory @xcite , random matrix theory and nonlinear @xmath4-models @xcite .",
    "one hope is that we will see many more contributions of this sort from theoretical condensed matter physicists and from pure mathematicians .",
    "for this reason , we have tried to keep the presentation pedagogical and appealing to a wide audience , especially to the undergraduate and graduate students looking for good projects , to the theoretical condensed matter researchers who like to compute things explicitly , and to specialists in non - commutative geometry looking for exciting applications of their field .",
    "the targeted audience is quite broad and choosing the style of the exposition was not easy .",
    "our final choice might not satisfy all readers , but at least we want to let the readers know that a great deal of effort was spent on this issue .",
    "our discussion is restricted only to the bulk properties of topological insulators in two dimensions .",
    "although the current and broadly accepted definition of a topological insulator highlights only the robust metallic character of the edge or surface states , every known topological insulator seems to display extended bulk states that are robust against disorder .",
    "this is an extraordinary behavior , especially in two dimensional models .",
    "when an edge or a surface is cut in a sample of topological insulator , the emerging edge / surface states seem to be connected to these bulk states .",
    "in fact , the edge / surface states can be viewed as these extended bulk states terminating at boundary .",
    "for this reason , understanding the bulk and the edge / surface properties of the topological insulators is equally important .",
    "we will present several numerical experiments , involving straightforward applications of classic techniques such as level spacing statistics .",
    "we will follow the standard interpretation of the numerical outputs , which will show a clear difference between the behavior of a normal and a topological insulator in the presence of disorder .",
    "this together with a detailed introduction of two models of topological insulators will occupy the first part of the review .",
    "we also describe here how to define a robust spin - chern invariant for @xmath2 non - conserving models ( that is , systems that do not decouple into independent copies of chern insulators ) .",
    "several interesting questions will emerge , which will set the direction for the rest of the review .",
    "the analytic part of the review presents a brisk account of the non - commutative theory of the chern number developed by bellissard , van elst and schulz - baldes @xcite .",
    "we have reworked certain parts to give the exposition a more ",
    "calculatoristic \" flavor , so that condensed matter physicists who like to compute could easily follow the arguments .",
    "we have complemented the proofs with discussions and remarks , and tried to keep the reader informed at all times about where the calculation or the argument is heading and why do we need to go there . we summarize the arguments before each lengthy proof to provide more guidance .",
    "we decided to collect the important statements in theorems , lemmas and propositions , something to the taste of the mathematicians but that could easily irritate other people .",
    "one reason for why we chose to do so was to alert the reader that these statements have a rigorous proof and that they can be applied with absolute confidence .",
    "another reason was that , by doing so , we can state in one place the result and the conditions when the result is valid .",
    "the last part is especially important for our subject because our main goal is precisely to find the most general conditions that assures the quantization and invariance of the topological numbers .",
    "the review includes a presentation of a numerical technique to evaluate the chern @xcite and spin - chern numbers in the presence of disorder .",
    "this technique steams directly from ncg theory and allows one to compute the invariants for finite systems without imposing the traditional twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the finite size formulas converge exponentially fast to the thermodynamic limit , given by the ncg theory .",
    "the technique allows us to compute the chern and spin - chern numbers for large lattice systems and large number of disorder configurations ( at least one order of magnitude over what is currently available in the published literature ) .",
    "the review has a section devoted entirely to applications .",
    "the class of chern insulators was chosen as the  control case , \" because they closely resemble the integer quantum hall - effect , already extremely well understood . in this case",
    ", the ncg theory gives a full account of all the effects seen in the numerical experiments on chern insulators , presented at the beginning of the review .",
    "calculations of the chern number will allow us to witness explicitly its quantization when the fermi level is located inside the localized part of the energy spectrum , and the failure of such quantization when the fermi level is located inside the delocalized part of the energy spectrum . for quantum spin - hall insulators ,",
    "we define the non - commutative spin - chern number , following ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss the conditions when its quantization occurs .",
    "explicit calculations of the spin - chern number indicate again quantization when the fermi level is located in the localized part of the energy spectrum .",
    "this will be a brief account , indeed .",
    "the reason we kept it short is because there are now several reviews surveying the evolution of the field and its current status , from both theoretical and experimental point of views @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , through this brief account we want to let the readers know about the impetuous advances that are happening right now in the field of topological insulators .",
    "it is probably a good idea to start from the integer quantum hall effect , ( iqhe ) which is now extremely well understood . discovered at the beginning of the 1980 s @xcite , iqhe revealed a truly spectacular manifestation of ordinary matter , displayed in the quantization of the hall conductance and the emergence of dissipationless charge currents flowing around the edges of any finite iqhe sample .",
    "the intellectual activity spurred by this effect has led to some of the greatest leaps in condensed matter theory . working with a clean periodic system and using kubo s formula for the hall conductance @xmath5 , thouless , kohmoto , nightingale and",
    "den nijs made the famous connection between @xmath5 and a topological invariant now known as the tknn invariant . using general charge - pumping arguments ,",
    "the hall conductance was also linked to the classic chern number ( see avron in physics today 2003 ) .",
    "but it was already clear from the early works @xcite that impurity states are essential for explaining the hall plateaus seen in the iqhe experiments .",
    "the quest for an analytic theory of iqhe that includes the disorder has led bellissard , van elst and schulz - baldes @xcite to one of the most amazing applications of a new and exciting branch of mathematics called non - commutative geometry @xcite . this work gives an explicit optimal condition that assures the quantization and invariance of the bulk hall - conductance in the presence of strong disorder .",
    "further homotopy arguments for quantization and invariance of the bulk hall - conductance were developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the progress about the edge physics of iqhe satarted with the works by hatsugai , who established in 1993 a fundamental result @xcite saying that the number of conducting edge channels , forming in an energy gap of the landau hamiltonian due to the presence of an edge , is equal to the total chern number of the landau levels below that gap .",
    "the technique developed by hatsugai can deal only with clean systems , rational magnetic flux and homogeneous edges with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it was only about 10 years later when , using the methods of non - commutative geometry , kellendonk , richter and schulz - baldes established @xcite a new link between the bulk and edge theory , which ultimately allowed them to generalize hatsugai s statement to cases with weak random potentials , irrational magnetic flux and general boundary conditions .",
    "the equality between bulk and edge hall conductance was also demonstrated by elbau and graf @xcite , soon after the publication of ref .",
    "@xcite , this time using more traditional methods .",
    "further progress was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , which treated continuous magnetic schrdinger operators and potentials that can assume quite general forms , in particular , they can include strong disorder .",
    "a similar result was established for discrete schrdinger operators in ref .",
    "we mentioned that some of these ideas were formalized in an abstract setting in ref .",
    "@xcite and applications to the edge states problem in topological insulators were given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the iqhe can be observed only in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field . in 1988 , haldane presented a model of a condensed matter phase that exhibits iqhe without the need of a macroscopic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the systems that behave like the one described by haldane are now called chern insulators .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry in these systems is broken like in the iqhe , but it is broken by the presence of a net magnetic moment in each unit cell rather than by an external magnetic field , as it is the case for iqhe .",
    "as we shall see , the techniques developed for iqhe can be directly applied to chern insulators , whose bulk and edge physics @xcite is very well understood now .",
    "the chern insulators were never found experimentally , even thought there is not one known physical reason for this not to happen one day .",
    "the haldane model truly describes the first topological insulator , but because of the lack of the experimental evidence , the field of topological insulators took off many years after the work of haldane .",
    "the interest for a related phenomenon , the spin - hall - effect , was picking up in the mid 2000 s .",
    "the effect was predicted decades ago @xcite , and says that a bar made of a semiconductor with strong spin - orbit interaction will display spin - polarized edge states when an electric charge current is forced through it .",
    "the effect was finally observed in 2004 - 2005 @xcite . the search for a quantized version of the spin - hall - effect started at the time when the results on the classical spin - hall - effect were making the news @xcite , but at that time nobody could imagine that there are samples displaying a quantized spin - hall - effect in the absence of externally applied fields .",
    "this changed after the discovery of graphene @xcite , which inspired kane and mele to propose an explicit model @xcite displaying topological edge modes carrying a net spin current around the edges .",
    "the emergence of the spin - carrying edge states is triggered solely by the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction and the flow of the spin current is protected by the time reversal symmetry of the model .",
    "all materials that are not magnetically ordered display the time - reversal symmetry , and there is a large number of materials with strong spin - orbit interaction that are not magnetically ordered .",
    "therefore , the chance of observing the quantum spin - hall - effect in real materials is quite high .",
    "the materials exhibiting this effect are now called quantum spin - hall ( qsh ) insulators and their hallmark is a dissipation - less spin current flowing along the edges of the samples , an effect due to the non - trivial topological properties of the bulk @xcite .",
    "the original calculations suggested that the newly discovered graphene could be a qsh insulator .",
    "unfortunately , the spin - orbit interaction is very weak in graphene and that makes the experimental detection of the effect very difficult .",
    "nevertheless , the race for the discovery of the first qsh insulator was on .",
    "hgte / cdte quantum wells were predicted to display qsh - effect in 2006 @xcite and confirmed experimentally in the following year @xcite .",
    "the first qsh insulator was discovered and a new field emerged @xcite , that of topological insulators defined as materials that are insulators in the bulk but metallic along any edge or surface that is cut into the material .",
    "unfortunately , the hgte quantum wells remain the only two dimensional qsh insulators discovered to date . in three dimensions ,",
    "the list of confirmed qsh insulators is quite impressive @xcite and the experimental characterization of these materials is vigorously underway @xcite ( see also the references cited in the introduction ) .",
    "additional classes of topological insulators are expected to emerge in the future @xcite .",
    "a chern insulator is a periodic band insulator with broken time reversal symmetry , with the distinct property of having a net charge current flowing around the edges of any finite sample .",
    "the time reversal symmetry is broken not by an externally applied magnetic field , but by some intrinsic property of the material , such as the occurrence of a net magnetic moment in each unit cell . in the following",
    ", we will use an explicit model to exemplify some of the most important features of these materials .    the first model of a chern insulator",
    "was introduced by haldane in 1988 @xcite , who worked with the honeycomb lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice1 ] . the honeycomb lattice can be viewed as a triangular lattice with two sites per unit cell ( see the shaded region in fig .  [ lattice1 ] ) .",

    "[ lattice1 ] , which will play a certain role later .",
    "the haldane model involves spinless electrons and assumes only one quantum state ( orbital ) per site , denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the linear combinations of these states generate a hilbert space @xmath10 , which is equipped with the scalar product @xmath11 .",

    "a more detailed analysis of the ldos will reveal that the right / left moving bands are localized on the lower / upper edges of the ribbon , respectively ( the correspondence will switch if we change the sign of @xmath43 ) .",
    "of course , there is a hybridization between two edge bands and a tiny energy gap is opened at the apparent band crossing , but this hybridization becomes exponentially small as the width of the ribbon is increased . for the ribbon considered in fig .",
    "[ chernspectrum ] , this hybridization can be practically ignored .",
    "in fact , if we keep one edge at the origin and send the other edge to infinity , that is , we consider a semi - infinite sample , we will observe just one edge band crossing the insulating bulk gap .    if @xmath28 is in the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ chernphaseboundary ] , the ribbon is in a metallic state , while if in the non - shaded region the ribbon remains in an insulating state .",
    "the edge bands seen in fig .",
    "[ chernspectrum](b ) are called chiral because they connect the valance and the conduction states . due to this feature and provided the bulk insulating gap remains open , those bands will not disappear when the hamiltonian is deformed by either changing the existing coupling constants or by turning on additional interaction terms .",

    "a clear spectral gap near the origin remains visible in all the plots and the spectrum closer to the origin was found to be localized . owing to the ncg theory of the chern number , we can state the following fact .     at @xmath67=5 and various strengths of the rashba potential , computed on lattices of increasing size .",
    "the other parameters were fixed at @xmath43=0.6 , @xmath42=0 and the fermi level was pinned at the origin.,width=377 ]    [ ncgspin - chern ] the spin - chern number is well defined and takes quantized values as long as the spectrum of @xmath546 near the origin is localized .",
    "the invariance of @xmath147 can be also established if some additional assumptions are considered , similar to those of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main issue now is to establish under what conditions is the spectrum of @xmath546 localized near the origin .",
    "the following simple argument will show that the localization lengths of the projectors @xmath545 diverge whenever the localization length of the full projector @xmath475 diverges .",
    "this shows that the phase defined by @xmath147=1 is contained within the boundaries defined by the metallic phase established in fig .",
    "[ qshlevelstatistics ] . here is the argument : @xmath583 which gives , @xmath584 therefore , whenever @xmath585 diverges to @xmath586 the localization lengths of @xmath587 ( which are equal due to the time - reversal symmetry ) will be forced to diverge to @xmath586 .",

    "the mid panels show the spectrum of @xmath546 with the fermi level pinned at the vertical marks , and the variance of the level spacings .",
    "the upper panels show the numerical values of the spin - chern number for many disorder configurations , corresponding to the same fermi levels indicated by the vertical marks .",
    "the computations was completed on a 40@xmath3540 lattice and for 1000 disorder configurations.,width=491 ]    the bulk theory of our qsh insulators will be completed if we can establish that the phase defined by @xmath147=1 actually extends all the way to the metallic phase inferred from fig .",
    "[ qshlevelstatistics ] . for this",
    "we need to establish that the localization length of the full projector @xmath475 diverges whenever the localization lengths of @xmath545 diverge .",
    "this will not only show that the @xmath147=1 phase extends all the way to the metallic phase , but will also imply the existence of such metallic phase surrounding the qsh phase .",
    "in other words , we will be able to establish the phase diagram of the qsh model in a manner similar to what was presented for chern insulators .",
    "this , unfortunately is a highly technical issue and falls beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the ncg statement from proposition  [ ncgspin - chern ] , the inequality of eq .  [ loclengths ] and the numerical technique for evaluating the spin - chern number , have given us the ground to study the remaining issue via numerical means .    in fig .",
    "[ seig40x40w3 ] , we show what happens when we lower the fermi level and cross the spectral region containing the extended states .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows the energy spectrum of @xmath62 at @xmath67=3 , together with the variance of the level spacings .",
    "the mid panels show the spectrum of @xmath546 with @xmath475 computed for the marked fermi levels .",
    "the upper panel shows the numerical value of the spin - chern number .",
    "the calculation was performed on a 40@xmath3540 lattice , for the qsh model with @xmath42=0 , @xmath43=0.6 and @xmath122=0.3 .",
    "we can see that , when the fermi level is away from the spectral region containing the delocalized states , the spectrum of @xmath588 displays a gap near the origin , and the variance of the level spacings for this spectrum indicates that the spectrum near the origin is localized .",
    "similarly , the spin - chern number takes quantized values whenever the fermi level is away from the energy region of delocalized states .",
    "this behavior was seen in all our numerical experiments , suggesting that indeed the @xmath147=1 phase extends all the way to the metallic phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that the variance in the mid panels collapses entirely onto the value 0.178 when the fermi level is in the region of extending states , suggesting that @xmath546 becomes a stereotypical gaussian random matrix when @xmath475 becomes delocalized .",
    "the discussion we just concluded dealt with two simple but fundamental questions for the field of topological insulators : how to define quantized topological invariants in the presence of strong disorder and what are the physical properties protected by such invariants ?",
    "these two questions are of absolute importance for most of the newly envisioned technological applications of these materials . in the same time , these questions are extremely difficult to deal with both analytically and numerically .",
    "progress in this direction , even if minuscule , is extremely valuable at this stage .",
    "we showcased two applications of the non - commutative theory of the chern invariant , which gave us a glimpse of the methods of non - commutative geometry and what can be achieved by such methods . for chern insulators ,",
    "the analysis gave quite explicit and satisfactory answers : we could spell out the most general conditions that assures the quantization and invariance of the non - commutative chern number , we were able to conclude the existence of protected extended bulk states and even to draw the phase diagram of our simple chern insulator model . for quantum spin - hall insulators",
    ", we defined the non - commutative spin - chern number and again were able to spell out the most general conditions that assures its quantization and invariance , even if in a formal way , and to give some simple explicit physical situations , the weak disorder regime , where the quantization and invariance of the spin - chern number can be firmly established .",
    "we have argued that the non - commutative spin - chern number is an effective tool for mapping the topological phase of the model with strong disorder .",
    "the numerical simulations indicated that the spin - chen number also protects the extended bulk states of the qsh insulator .",
    "the construction of the non - commutative spin - chern number can be repeated for many other situations .",
    "there is a firm belief among the condensed matter scientists that every discrete symmetry has an associated topological insulator and a topological invariant that classifies its topological phases and the efforts towards identifying new classes of topological insulators are already underway @xcite .",
    "we believe that novel topological phases can be found by looking for analogs of @xmath589 , that is , @xmath590 operators such that the spectrum of @xmath591 splits in distinct spectral islands that carry non - zero chern numbers .",
