    "recent experimental studies of weakly doped cuprates have revealed a novel enigmatic state : the nodal metal.ando01,zhou03,dumm03,yslee04,taillefer03 this state is realized with only few holes introduced in parent antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulators where doped materials still show af ordering or the so - called spin - glass regime at low temperatures and extends throughout the notorious pseudogap region .",
    "spectroscopic signatures of this electronic state include a drude - like response in the optical conductivity@xcite and a quasiparticle ( qp ) peak on the nodal fermi arc  seen in the photoemission data.@xcite the electronic mobility and the fermi velocity of nodal qp , as well as their optical effective mass , remain virtually unchanged as doping progresses to much higher carrier density where superconductivity is optimized.ando01,zhou03,padilla04 all of these observations contradict a common characterization of the af - ordered region of phase diagram as antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "carrier dynamics in the nodal metal is strongly influenced by unidirectional spin and/or charge self - organization effects commonly referred to as stripes.@xcite unambiguous manifestations of stripes can be found through experiments probing the anisotropy of conductivity within the nearly square cuo@xmath1 planes.@xcite infrared ( ir ) experiments carried out with polarized light reveal the enhancement of optical conductivity along the spin stripes  direction in la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( lsco)@xcite and along the ripples of the electron density in the cuo@xmath1 planes in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco).@xcite    the carrier density @xmath7 in the nodal metal varies linearly with doping : a result that became established shortly after the discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductors@xcite and detailed in more recent studies.ando01,segawa04,ando04 an important consequence of the @xmath8 relationship is a dramatic suppression of the resistivity probed with currents along the cuo@xmath1 plane as one proceeds from antiferromagnetically ordered phases to over - doped metals .",
    "it is rather surprising that dynamical characteristics of charges including the electric mobility,@xcite the nodal fermi velocity,@xcite or quasiparticles optical mass @xmath9@xcite reveal negligible changes throughout the phases diagram .    in this paper",
    "we report on a detailed study of the nodal metal state in ybco : a prototypical high-@xmath0 superconductor carried out using untwinned single crystals for ten different dopings between @xmath10 = 6.28 and @xmath10 = 7.00 .",
    "these new results unveil the evolution of the electromagnetic response as doping progresses from af - ordered phase to superconducting materials .",
    "new data allow us to comprehensively test and re - examine common approaches to analyze the electrodynamics of cuprates .",
    "we show that the ir signatures of the nodal metal involve a two - component conductivity : the drude mode at low energies followed by a resonance in mid - ir .",
    "the drude component can be attributed to the response of coherent qp residing on the fermi arcs ; the microscopic origin of the mid - ir band is yet to be thoroughly understood .",
    "the two - component conductivity extends to the pseudogap boundary in the phase diagram at @xmath11 .",
    "we find similar trends in the response of the lsco system and conclude that the nodal metal state is a hallmark of the electrodynamics of the pseudogap regime . in order to narrow down the range of possible microscopic interpretations of the mid - ir structure we have carried out studies of the @xmath10 = 6.65 single crystal in high magnetic field ( * h * ) .",

    "indeed , the negative slope ( or peak structure ) of the 1/@xmath20 at high frequencies is inconsistent with a single - component description of the electromagnetic response .",
    "this statement become readily apparent , for example , after a brief inspection of the allen@xmath25s formula developed within the framework of the electron - boson scattering : allen71,shulga91 @xmath26where @xmath27 is the electron - boson spectral function and @xmath28 is the impurity scattering . because of the integral relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath27 the slope of the scattering rate spectrum can not be negative .",
    "therefore , the non - monotonic dependence of 1/@xmath20 at low dopings clearly indicates a breakdown of the edm analysis ( or single component analysis ) to the heavily underdoped samples .",
    "this is hardly surprising given the fact that for the latter materials the two distinct absorption features are readily detected in the @xmath29 spectra . as the doping increases ,",
    "the peak structures in the 1/@xmath20 spectra are suppressed and shift to higher frequencies . at doping @xmath30",

    "we will now demonstrate that the gross features of both @xmath32 and 1/@xmath20 spectra described above can be qualitatively reproduced with a two - component scenario for the electromagnetic response .",

    "only a minute @xmath22-dependence of 1/@xmath20 at frequencies above 500 @xmath21 is accounted for by the mid - ir band which is essentially independent of temperature .",
    "we wish to emphasize nearly linear frequency dependence of the modeled 1/@xmath38 spectra in fig .",
    "this frequency dependence is often regarded as one of the most anomalous features of the normal state response of of high-@xmath0 superconductors .",

    "we are capable of measuring the absolute values of reflectivity in the magnetic field.@xcite for @xmath10 = 6.65 system we found that the field - induced changes of the reflectivity are negligibly small either under zero - field cooling or under in - field cooling conditions .",
    "the same instrument was successfully used to monitor transitions between the landau levels in graphite which produce only weak changes of @xmath74 comparable to anticipated effect in ybco.@xcite we also repeated measurements for @xmath10 = 6.50 crystal and did not detect significant field - induced changes of reflectance in mid - ir .",
    "these results call for a revision of the prominent role of magnetic excitations in qps dynamics .",
    "the key experimental finding of this work is that the gross features of the low - temperature electrodynamics in ybco are adequately described within the two - component model ( eq .  2 ) .",
    "this simple description holds throughout an extended region of the phase diagram from af - ordered phases to @xmath51-wave superconductor .",

    "the net result of these effects is that the two contributions merge and can no longer be separated beyond a certain doping level ( @xmath76 6.75 in ybco and @xmath77 0.125 in lsco ) .",

    "it is therefore imperative to take into account this other contribution before inquiring into the role of self - energy in the coherent component of the conductivity .    as a note of caution",
    "it must be stressed that marked effects are not necessarily expected if the magnetic resonance broadens in the applied field .",
    "since it is the integrated weight of the magnetic mode that is relevant for self - energy a simple smearing of the resonance is unlikely to significantly modify ir data . in this context",
    "we stress that ins results of dai _",
    "et al_. suggest a reduction of the intensity of the mode and not its broadening.@xcite if this latter behavior is confirmed by future neutron studies , our observed behavior is incompatible with the spin exciton interpretation of the ins resonance mode .",
    "we investigated the electromagnetic responses of a prototypical high-@xmath0 cuprate ybco in a broad region of the phase diagram from the af to the pseudogap state ( @xmath10 = 6.28 - 6.75 ) .",
    "we focused on the analysis of the nodal metal phase that is characterized by a clear energy separation between the low - energy electronic states responsible for drude conductivity and higher energy excitations producing mid - ir structure in the optical data .",
    "we emphasized close parallels in the ir data for ybco and lsco systems and concluded that the two - component characteristics may be generic for high-@xmath92 cuprates . at least in the case of lsco ,",
    "the two - component nature of the electronic excitations is also consistent with both the arpes and transport results .",
    "a combination of transport and ir experiments has allowed us to identify several hallmarks of the fermi liquid in the properties of the nodal metal .",
    "interestingly , this rather conventional electronic behavior characterized with the high electronic mobility@xcite and relatively low effective mass@xcite extends to af ordered phases .",
    "these latter findings clearly show that the transition from a nodal metal to a mott insulator is of vanishing carrier number.imada98 the above experiments also suggest that transport in nodal metals may be governed by excitations topologically compatible with an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "many of the doping trends reported here are consistent with the projected wave functions approach.@xcite one conjecture reconciling anomalous trends seen in weakly doped cuprates is that the local environment of mobile charges in these systems remains unaltered with doping and it is only the phase space occupied by hole rich regions that is progressively increasing .",
    "we show that the pseudogap state in the generic phase diagram is associated with a crossover from the two - component conductivity of a nodal metal to the single component response at @xmath93 . in the vicinity of the pseudogap boundary",
    "the effective number of charge carriers contributing to transport and optics is enhanced.@xcite this indicates that the functional form of the dc resistivity of cuprates @xmath94 is governed not only by the relaxation processes but also by temperature dependent number of carriers .",
    "even though the mid - ir band is contributing to transport at high temperature , the low - temperature properties of cuprates are dominated by nodal quasiparticles . in superconducting crystals the vast majority of the superfluid spectral weight",
    "is produced by condensation of nodal quasiparticles .",
    "high - field magneto - optics experiments pose challenges for the interpretation of the ir spectra in terms of fermionic self - energy effects prompted by coupling of quasiparticles to a neutron resonance . in view of the two - component response documented here",
    "it is imperative to take into account the mid - ir contribution before the low - frequency data is employed to search for strong coupling effects .",
    "however , this task is connected with ambiguous procedures to remove the mid - ir contribution from the data .",
    "we therefore have not attempted this analysis here .",
    "we note that the success of a simple drude+lorentzian description of the data ( fig .",
    "6 ) indicates that the self - energy effects in optics may be rather weak .",
    "it is therefore of interest to re - examine the self - energy correction in the results obtained with other spectroscopies .",
    "measurements in magnetic field are of high interest in this context .",
    "while it may be impossible to carry out such experiments in the case of photoemission studies , tunneling measurements appear to be well suited for this task .",
