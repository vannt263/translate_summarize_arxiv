    "scalar field cosmology is of importance in the study of the early universe and particularly in the investigation of inflation ( during which the universe undergoes a period of accelerated expansion @xcite ) .",
    "one particular class of inflationary cosmological models are those with a scalar field and an exponential potential of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants .",
    "models with an exponential scalar field potential arise naturally in alternative theories of gravity , such as , for example , scalar - tensor theories , and are currently of particular interest since such theories occur as the low - energy limit in supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "a number of authors have studied scalar field cosmological models with an exponential potential within general relativity .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models were first studied by halliwell @xcite using phase - plane methods .",
    "homogeneous but anisotropic models of bianchi types i and iii ( and kantowski - sachs models ) were studied by burd and barrow @xcite in which they found exact solutions and discussed their stability .",
    "bianchi models of types iii and vi were studied by feinstein and ibez @xcite , in which exact solutions were found .",
    "an analysis of bianchi models , including standard matter satisfying various energy conditions , was completed by kitada and maeda @xcite .",
    "they found that the well - known power - law inflationary solution is an attractor for all initially expanding bianchi models ( except a subclass of the bianchi type ix models which will recollapse ) when @xmath3 .    the governing differential equations in spatially homogeneous bianchi cosmologies containing a scalar field with an exponential potential reduce to a dynamical system when appropriate normalised variables are defined ;",
    "this dynamical system was studied in detail in @xcite . in a follow - up paper",
    "@xcite the isotropisation of the bianchi vii@xmath4 cosmological models possessing a scalar field with an exponential potential was further investigated ; in the case @xmath5 , it was shown that there is an open set of initial conditions in the set of anisotropic bianchi vii@xmath4 initial data such that the corresponding cosmological models isotropise asymptotically .",
    "hence , spatially homogeneous scalar field cosmological models having an exponential potential with @xmath5 can isotropise to the future .",
    "the bianchi type ix models have also been studied in more detail @xcite .",
    "recently , cosmological models which contain both a perfect fluid and a scalar field with an exponential potential have come under heavy analysis @xcite .",
    "one of the exact solutions found for these models has the property that the energy density due to the scalar field is proportional to the energy density of the perfect fluid , hence these models have been labelled scaling cosmologies @xcite .",
    "these scaling solutions , which are spatially flat isotropic models , are of particular physical interest .",
    "for example , in these models a significant fraction of the current energy density of the universe may be contained in the scalar field whose dynamical effects mimic cold dark matter . in @xcite the stability of these cosmological scaling solutions within the class of spatially",
    "homogeneous cosmological models with a perfect fluid subject to the equation of state @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is a constant satisfying @xmath8 ) and a scalar field with an exponential potential was studied .",
    "it was found that when @xmath9 , and particularly for realistic matter with @xmath10 , the scaling solutions are unstable ; essentially they are unstable to curvature perturbations , although they are stable to shear perturbations .",
    "curvature scaling solutions @xcite and anisotropic scaling solutions @xcite are also possible .",
    "in particular , in @xcite homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with non - zero spatial curvature were studied .",
    "clearly it is of interest to study more general cosmological models , and in this paper we shall comprehensively study the qualitative properties of the class of self - similar spherically symmetric models with a barotropic fluid and a non - interacting scalar field with an exponential potential .",
    "self - similar spherically symmetric perfect fluid models with a linear equation of state have been much studied in general relativity @xcite .",
    "carr & coley @xcite have presented a complete asymptotic classification of such solutions and , by reformulating the field equations for these models , goliath _ et al _ @xcite have obtained a compact three - dimensional state space representation of the solutions which leads to another complete picture of the solution space .",
    "recently , these models have been further studied in a combined approach @xcite .",
    "the present analysis can be thought of as a natural extension of this recent work @xcite .",
    "the kantowski - sachs models appear as a limiting case of the class of spherically symmetric models under investigation , and hence this analysis complements recent analyses of spatially homogeneous bianchi models @xcite .",
    "models with _ positive spatial curvature _ have attracted less attention than bianchi models with _",
    "zero spatial curvature _ or _ negative spatial curvature _ since they are more complicated mathematically .",
    "however , the properties of positive - curvature frw models @xcite and kantowski - sachs models @xcite have been studied previously .    in the next section",
    "we shall describe the governing equations of the class of models under investigation . in section [ sec : sss ] ,",
    "compact variables are defined and the resulting dynamical system is derived in the case of spatial self - similarity . a monotone function is obtained .",
    "the equilibrium points and their local stability is discussed in section [ sec : ssseq ] .",
    "the timelike self - similar case is then considered in sections [ sec : tss ] and [ sec : tsseq ] .",
    "the special equilibrium points for values of `` extreme tilt '' are discussed separately in section [ sec : extreme ] .",
    "the global results and a discussion is given in section [ sec : global ] .",
    "applications in the absence of a barotropic fluid and in the further subcase of a massless scalar field are discussed , respectively , in sections [ sec : fluidvac ] and [ sec : massless ] , partially to illustrate the early - time and late - time behaviour of the models .",
    "we shall consider spherically symmetric similarity solutions in which the source for the gravitational field is a perfect fluid and a non - interacting scalar field with an exponential potential in which the total energy - momentum tensor is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 the perfect fluid obeys the equation of state @xmath13 where @xmath7 is a constant satisfying @xmath14 .",

    "this implies that the matter fields must be of a particular form .",
    "thus , a barotropic fluid must have an equation of state of the form ( [ eq : eos ] ) @xcite",

    "when the similarity variable is timelike , we will use the notation @xmath23 .",
    "the homothetic vector then is spacelike , and we denote this as the _ spatially self - similar _ case . when the homothetic vector is timelike , we have the _ timelike self - similar _ case , for which @xmath24 .",
