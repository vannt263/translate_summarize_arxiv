    "an understanding of the mechanism controlling the early x - ray afterglow emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been one of the most debated issues since the launch of the _ swift _ satellite .",
    "the canonical x - ray afterglow can be classified into three phases : the steep - decay phase  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the shallow - decay ( or plateau ) phase and the normal - decay phase  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the shallow - decay phase is difficult to explain by the standard external forward shock ( fs ) model  ( see reviews , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "numerous models have been proposed so far to explain it .",
    "most frequently discussed models are modified external shock models .",
    "one of the most popular interpretations involves either a continuous energy injection into the external fs , where the long - lasting central engine energy output has a smooth decline @xmath1 , or short - lived central engine ejects shells with a steep power - law distribution of bulk lorentz factors which can explain the shallow - decay emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another version invokes a time - dependent microphysical scenario in the fs model , where changing parameters such as @xmath2 lead to the observed shallow - decay emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dermer ( 2007 ) showed that the shallow decline may be explained if ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays are efficiently produced , by the recovery of an adiabatic relativistic blast wave after its radiative phase due to efficient photomeson losses and particle escape .",
    "the external reverse shock ( rs ) may also account for the shallow - decay emission , with an appropriate @xmath3 distribution of the ejecta , if the rs emission dominates over the fs emission in the x - ray band  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , some authors have suggested explanations based on two- or multi - component jet scenarios .",
    "panaitescu ( 2008a ) showed that upscattering of fs photons by a relativistic shell can outshine the standard fs emission .",
    "recently , yamazaki ( 2009 ) proposed an alternative interpretation , where x - ray light curves are explained by the difference between the x - ray onset time and the burst trigger time . among geometrical models , two co - aligned jets with different opening angles , i.e. , wide and narrow jets ,",
    "can also lead to the shallow - decay emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while a multiple - sub - jets model was also proposed as one of the explanations  @xcite .",
    "another attractive interpretation is that x - ray emission is attributed to long - lasting internal dissipation  @xcite .",
    "this long - lasting dissipation or late prompt emission model can explain the chromatic behavior , which is not so easy to explain in modified external shock models where the optical flux would presumably track trends of the x - ray flux .",
    "this model is viable in the sense that the shallow - decay phase is not ubiquitous and some grb afterglows are explained simply by the standard fs model when the late prompt emission is weak .",
    "especially , some of the grbs such as grb 070110 have a plateau and a following steep decline , which strongly suggests that x - rays originate from the late internal dissipation rather than the fs emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this late internal dissipation model may also be consistent with the existence of x - ray flares in the early afterglow phase  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the situation is still inconclusive and unclear .",
    "for example , the lack of spectral evolution across the transition from the plateau to the normal - decay phase and the compliance of the closure relations in the normal - decay phase after the transition may rather suggest fs models  @xcite .    on the other hand , recent novel results from the _ fermi _ satellite have provided us with interesting clues for the mechanisms of grbs .",
    "especially , the onboard large area telescope ( lat ) has detected high - energy ( @xmath4 gev ) gamma rays from a fraction of grbs  @xcite .",
    "those detections have provided not only clues to the prompt emission mechanism but have also provided the first detailed data about the high - energy afterglow emission , which had been expected for many years  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , late - time high - energy gamma - ray emission from grbs such as 080916c , 090510 , and 090902b has been attributed to afterglow emission rather than the prompt emission  @xcite .",
    "various theoretical possibilities for the high - energy emission mechanism have also been discussed by numerous authors .",
    "the most widely discussed mechanisms are synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission  ( see review , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the external inverse - compton ( eic ) emission has been considered in some cases where seed photons come from flares or prompt emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if protons and nuclei are accelerated up to very high energies , hadronic gamma - ray afterglows are also expected via the photomeson production and ion synchrotron radiation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite recent progress in observations of high - energy gamma rays , the link between grbs with shallow - decay emission and grbs whose high - energy emission is detected by _",
    "fermi _ is uncertain , since due to the scarcity of simultaneous detections with _ swift _",
    "it is unclear whether grbs detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat do have the shallow - decay phase or not . also , the detectability with",
    "_ fermi _ is limited at late times so that it is not easy to distinguish among the various models for shallow - decay emission . in this sense",
    ", cherenkov detectors such as magic and veritas may be more important .",
    "although detections of @xmath5  gev photons from distant grbs become difficult because of the attenuation by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , cherenkov telescopes could provide many more photons than _ fermi _ when a nearby and/or energetic burst occurs .",
    "although very high - energy photons from grbs have not been firmly detected so far , the future cta and agis arrays would significantly increase the chances to observe high - energy grb emission .    given a high enough detection rate of high - energy photons by such observatories",
    ", high - energy gamma rays would provide very useful probes of the origin of shallow - decay emission .",
    "for example , murase et al .",
    "( 2010 ) demonstrated that eic emission would be important to diagnose the prior emission model  @xcite , which is one of the two - component ( early and late ) jet models . in this work , motivated by the above prospects",
    ", we discuss theoretical possibilities of late internal dissipation scenarios and investigate the associated high - energy emission .",
    "first , we review various late prompt emission scenarios , such as the late internal shocks , dissipative photosphere , and magnetic dissipation scenarios .",
    "second , we analytically study the high - energy gamma - ray emission expected in the internal dissipation model .",
    "in particular , we numerically calculate the eic emission in detail , which plays an important role in two - component jet models such as the late prompt emission model . throughout this work ,",
    "cosmological parameters are set to @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , and we adopt the conventional notation @xmath9 .",
    "observationally , a good fraction of grb afterglows show shallow - decay emission from @xmath10  s to @xmath11  s  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be expressed as @xmath12 here @xmath13  s is the break time when the shallow - decay phase ceases , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "many grbs show the chromatic behavior , where optical and x - ray afterglows evolve in different ways , which tempts one to consider a two - component interpretation , i.e. , x - ray and optical emissions come from different emission regions .",
    "some authors argued that the shallow - decay x - ray emission may be attributed to emission caused by internal dissipation similar to that of the prompt emission , while the normal - decay optical emission is interpreted as an external fs component  @xcite .",
    "for example , ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2009 ) successfully fitted x - ray and optical afterglows of various bursts in this picture .",
    "the isotropic radiation energy of late prompt emission , @xmath16 , is typically @xmath17  erg , where @xmath18 is the isotropic radiation energy of prompt emission .",
    "such an interpretation seems strongly supported for a fraction of bursts .",
    "some grb afterglows show even a plateau rather than a shallow decay .",
    "for example , grb 070110 has the plateau , @xmath19 , and the following sudden decline , @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "such a behavior is very difficult to explain in the context of modified external shock models , which rather reflect variable activities of the long - lived central engine , although some of the issues can be solved if the emission is anisotropic in the comoving frame  @xcite .",
    "then , the late prompt emission would presumably be attributed to long - lasting internal dissipation .",
    "this interpretation seems consistent with the existence of flares , which are observed in about @xmath21  % of grbs  @xcite , and flares may be attributed to accidental events of stronger internal dissipation , in the late internal dissipation scenario  @xcite .",
    "the duration of flares @xmath22 is shorter than the observation time @xmath23 and its flux enhancement is striking ( the energy fluence is about 10  % of prompt emission ) , which suggests that they originate from temporarily strong late internal dissipation by the long - lasting central engine  @xcite .",
    "one puzzling point is that the pulse width of flares increases linearly with time  @xcite , while those of prompt emission have various durations , showing no increasing pulse width during the burst .",
    "possibly , this may reflect the behavior of the central engine .",
    "in the late internal dissipation model , one may expect some time variability in the apparently smooth x - ray light curve of the shallow - decay emission , where it may also include some information on the central engine .",
    "however , at present , it is difficult to measure well even if the emission consists of numerous events of small internal dissipation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the shallow - decay emission originates from long - lasting internal dissipation , what activity of the central engine could be responsible for it ?",
    "for the central engine of grbs , two possibilities have been most frequently discussed , accretion of matter onto a black hole  @xcite or a fast rotating magnetar  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter scenario ,",
    "the break time @xmath24 can be attributed to the spin down time .",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spin down luminosity . in this scenario ,",
    "the outflow would initially be poynting - dominated .    in the former scenario ,",
    "the shallow - decay behavior is attributed to the activity of the system of a black hole with an accretion disk , e.g. , mass fall back accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "the break time @xmath27 can be interpreted as the end time of mass fall back .",
    "kumar et al .",
    "( 2008b ) proposed that prompt emission is associated with the accretion of the innermost region of the progenitor star , whose angular velocity is small , while the outer envelope with the larger angular velocity is responsible for the shallow - decay emission .",
    "the outflow luminosity is expected to be proportional to the mass accretion rate , and then the temporal index @xmath28 is related to its behavior .",
    "after @xmath24 , we expect  @xcite @xmath29}^{-\\frac{4(s+1)}{3}}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the accretion timescale and @xmath31 .",
    "the above expression can explain both the rapid decline ( when @xmath32 ) and smooth transition",
    "( when @xmath33 ) at @xmath34 .",
    "there is also another interpretation of the behavior after @xmath35 and the origin of @xmath35 .",
    "if the late jet continuously decelerates , one expects a jet break in observed light curves when @xmath36 becomes @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "note that the late internal dissipation could also explain the steep - decay emission just after the prompt emission phase , although it is usually attributed to the high - latitude prompt emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , in the collapsar scenario , kumar et al .",
    "( 2008b ) suggested that the accretion of gas from the `` transition '' region between the core and the envelope , where the density has a steep decline , may lead to the steep - decay emission .",
    "however , such possibility that x - ray tails reflect the dying history of the central engine totally depends on models of the central engine , and the present situation is unclear since the apparent spectral evolution is also affected by the intrinsic spectrum of the prompt emission  @xcite .",
    "at present , it is difficult to discriminate among these possibilities from observations .",
    "therefore , for the discussions below , we treat the temporal indices @xmath28 and @xmath38 as just parameters determined from observations .",
    "also , we assume that the long - lasting internal dissipation occurs according to equation  ( 1 ) without specifying the central engine .      in the classical scenario , the prompt emission",
    "is explained by electromagnetic radiation from electrons accelerated at internal shocks that occur in the optically thin relativistic outflow  @xcite .",
    "flares may also be explained similarly , where x - ray and/or ultraviolet photons are produced by relativistic electrons accelerated at late internal shocks  @xcite .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor responsible for flares is often thought to be smaller than that of prompt emission  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and then , applying this scenario to late prompt emission , the typical collision radius is estimated as @xmath39 .",
    "( however , in some models such as the fast rotating magnetar model  @xcite , the bulk lorentz factor of the late jet may be much larger . )",
    "let us consider the two - shell collision between fast and slow shells with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the relative lorentz factor between the shells is @xmath42 and the average lorentz factor of random internal motions is @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( where the lorentz factor of the merged shell is @xmath46 ) .",
    "then , the electron injection lorentz factor is obtained as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fraction of the internal energy transferred to non - thermal electrons and @xmath49 is a number fraction of accelerated electrons . introducing @xmath50 which is the fraction of the internal energy transferred to the magnetic field , the comoving magnetic field is estimated as @xmath51}^{1/2 } { \\epsilon}_{b,-1}^{1/2 } l_{k,49}^{1/2 } r_{i,15}^{-1 } { ( \\gamma_{\\rm lp}/5)}^{-1}$ ] , and then the observed synchrotron peak energy is @xmath52 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & f_{e,-1}^{-2 } \\epsilon_{e,-1}^2 \\epsilon_{b,-1}^{1/2 } l_{k,49}^{1/2 } r_{i,15}^{-1 } { ( 1+z)}^{-1}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the observed x - ray emission shows a hard spectrum in the x - ray band , @xmath53 , which is attributed to synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons with the spectral index of @xmath54 . accelerated electrons are expected to be in the fast cooling regime .    in the case of prompt emission , the classical scenario has several problems in explaining observations .",
    "one of them is that , if the radiation mechanism is synchrotron emission , explaining the low - energy spectral index of @xmath55 is not easy  ( but see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but , since the spectrum in the far - ultraviolet range is not observed , it is uncertain whether the late internal shock scenario suffers from the same issue .",
    "another one is the efficiency problem that energy transferred to prompt emission often seems larger than the afterglow kinetic energy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiency seems worse due to weaker collisions in the late internal shock model , but it is observationally unclear whether the shallow - decay emission has the same problem .      in the previous subsection , we discussed the late internal shock model based on the analogy to the prompt emission .",
    "however , the prompt emission mechanism itself is still under debate , and many possibilities have been suggested .",
    "another popular scenario of the prompt emission is the photospheric emission model , where quasi - thermal emission comes from around the photosphere ( @xmath56 )  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although there are various versions  ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we here consider the dissipative photosphere scenario  @xcite , where internal dissipation ( via e.g. , internal shocks or magnetic reconnection ) occurs around the photosphere . for the late jet making late prompt emission ,",
    "the photospheric radius is written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the ratio of the radiation energy to the kinetic energy carried by cold baryons , and @xmath59 is the ratio of the number of electrons to the number of baryons , taking into account the possibility of copious pair production via internal dissipation .",
    "the photospheric radius thus obtained would generally be above the typical radius of a wolf - rayet star .",
    "also , especially when the late jet is baryon - rich compared to that for prompt emission , the photospheric radius is likely to be located above the coasting radius .",
    "the comoving temperature at the photospheric radius is @xmath60 and the observed typical energy is @xmath61 the observed x - ray emission shows a hard spectrum in the x - ray band , @xmath53 , which requires some process such as comptonization by nonthermal electrons produced via internal dissipation around the photosphere . in this scenario , the variability timescale would be relatively short , @xmath62 , although dissipation itself may last for a longer time .",
    "as mentioned before , flares would also be caused by activities of the long - lasting central engine .",
    "however , it might not be easy to explain flares in this scenario .",
    "flares seem to be caused by occasional larger dissipation of relativistic outflows but those with lorentz factors whose values are larger than the values of prompt emission but may be smaller than the values of late prompt emission , @xmath63  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "light curves of flares often show the exponential decay after the peak , which suggests relatively large emission radii of @xmath64 , if the decay of pulses is attributed to high - latitude emission .",
    "the typical radii seem above the photospheric radius , unless the jet is largely pair dominated . here",
    ", one should keep in mind that the photospheric scenario and other scenarios are not mutually exclusive .",
    "for example , internal shocks may occur well above the photospheric radius as well as around the photospheric radius  @xcite .",
    "magnetic reconnection is also one of the possibilities .",
    "relativistic jets launched by the central engine may be initially poynting - dominated .",
    "if the outflow is still poynting - dominated at the emission radii , without significant conversion into the kinetic energy , magnetic dissipation rather than shock dissipation of the bulk kinetic energy may lead to production of nonthermal particles .",
    "although detailed scenarios for this are still unavailable due to lack of our knowledge on mechanisms of magnetic dissipation and associated particle acceleration , prompt and/or late prompt emission may be produced by internal dissipation of a significant fraction of the magnetic energy in the outflow .",
    "for example , lyutikov ( 2006 ) argued that magnetic dissipation may occur around the radius where the mhd approximation breaks down , if the outflow is extremely magnetized . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic fields are distorted by internal shocks at @xmath65  cm , which may eventually lead to efficient magnetic reconnection  @xcite .",
    "in this work , just for demonstrative purposes , we apply the jets - in - a - jet model  @xcite for the late prompt emission . in this scenario ,",
    "the magnetic reconnection in a jet leads to many mini - blobs with relative lorentz factors of @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , radiation from such mini - blobs can reproduce highly variable light curves of prompt emission , though there remain potential problems  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the late jet has @xmath67 with the magnetization parameter of @xmath68 , the dissipation radius is estimated as @xmath69 .",
    "the typical electron lorentz factor is estimated as @xmath70 the magnetic field in the downstream blob can be @xmath71 ( note that it does not have to be poynting dominated since a significant fraction of the magnetic energy is dissipated there ) .",
    "then , the typical synchrotron peak energy is estimated as . ]",
    "@xmath72 which seems consistent with observations",
    ". a hard spectrum , @xmath53 , may be attributed to synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons accelerated at shocks caused by mini - blobs .",
    "note that electrons are typically in the fast cooling regime , since @xmath73 ( of course , the actual electron lorentz factor should be larger than unity ) . here",
    ", the lower bulk lorentz factor with the lower magnetization is assumed for the late jet compared to the case of prompt emission , but it may not be the case in some models such as the fast rotating magnetar model  @xcite . in order to have the synchrotron peak of @xmath74  kev , not only large radii but also low values of @xmath2 might be required in this scenario .",
    "for example , if @xmath75 and @xmath76  cm , @xmath77 and the short variability time are expected , depending on the scenario .",
    "next , we consider consequences of the late internal dissipation model for high - energy emission . one can consider two possibilities of high - energy emission .",
    "one is eic emission produced by electrons accelerated at the external shock caused by the early jet , which is responsible for the prompt emission and the observed standard afterglow component .",
    "late prompt photons from inner radii are naturally upscattered in the late internal dissipation model , and predictions are not sensitive to details of late internal dissipation models . in this paper ,",
    "we especially discuss this possibility in detail ( see the next section ) .",
    "the other is the high - energy emission from the emission radius at which internal dissipation occurs , e.g. , ssc emission from the late jet .",
    "obviously , predictions of high - energy emission depend on each scenario . this possibility is also discussed in this section .",
    "first , we discuss eic emission caused by interactions with late prompt photons and electrons accelerated at the external shock of the early jet producing prompt emission . as demonstrated below",
    ", this eic emission is useful as a test of the late internal dissipation model .",
    "we here give analytical considerations , but more detailed results with numerical calculations are provided in the next section .",
    "we can think that one of the two components is the standard afterglow component from the early jet . for an adiabatic relativistic blast wave expanding into the interstellar medium ( ism )  @xcite",
    ", we obtain the bulk lorentz factor as @xmath78 and the external shock radius is estimated as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the isotropic kinetic energy of the ejecta and @xmath81 is the ism density .",
    "electrons would be accelerated at the external fs .",
    "the injection lorentz factor of electrons is estimated as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the spectral index of fs electrons . here",

    "those parameters are indicated from late - time observations but not exact ones for explaining long - lasting gev emission , since implied @xmath234 is smaller than those used in kumar & barniol duran ( 2010 ) .",
    "in fact , liu & wang ( 2010 ) showed that the gev emission may rather be explained by an additional jet component ( although the two - component jet model used there is different from that considered here ) . here , we are not pursuing possibilities to explain the long - lasting gev emission with the late internal dissipation model , so these parameters are suitable enough for the present purpose .",
    "as can be seen , for our parameters on late prompt emission , the eic component is dominant over the ssc one at late times .",
    "the eic component is especially important at high energies of @xmath281  gev . at lower energies , the synchrotron component dominates over the others , although the curve shown is fairly optimistic ( since @xmath282 is used assuming that the upstream magnetic field is the downstream one and @xmath283 ) .",
    "as is demonstrated in figure  16 , the eic emission induced by late prompt emission can typically be important in very high energies only at relatively late times , so that our results on high - energy afterglow emission are compatible with the _ fermi _ observations .",
    "on the other hand , high - energy late prompt emission could potentially be relevant in the gev range .",
    "one may expect that it shows the shallow - decay behavior when the shallow - decay emission comes from the late internal dissipation .",
    "however , the observational situation is currently unclear since simultaneous detections by _ fermi _ and _ swift _ are required .",

    "the attenuation by pair creation both inside and outside the source is taken into account . ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the possibility that the shallow - decay or plateau emission originates from late internal dissipation in the late jet driven by the long - lasting central engine ( e.g. , mass fall back onto a black hole or rotational energy loss of fast rotating magnetars ) .",
    "we have discussed various theoretical scenarios of the emission mechanism , late internal shock , magnetic dissipation , and photospheric scenarios .",
    "there are few clues to the origin of the late prompt emission , and all the three scenarios seem compatible with observations at present .    we have also investigated the associated high - energy emission in the late internal dissipation model and discussed two possibilities : high - energy late prompt emission and high - energy afterglow emission .",
    "the former comes from internal dissipation in the late jet , and the predictions depend on the specific scenarios .",
    "for example , in the photospheric scenario , high - energy emission may be produced by the ic process but @xmath4  gev emission is not expected in the one - zone case due to the large pair - creation opacity around the photosphere . on the other hand ,",
    "the late internal shock and magnetic dissipation scenarios may lead to @xmath215  gev gamma rays by the ssc mechanism , which are important for _ fermi_. as demonstrated in this work , detections by _ fermi _ and",
    "possibly cta are expected for nearby and/or energetic grbs , which would be useful for revealing the mechanism of late prompt emission .",
    "the latter possibility includes the ssc and eic emissions produced by electrons accelerated at the external shock , which will be especially relevant in the very high energy range .",
    "especially , the eic emission , which is high - energy afterglow emission induced by late prompt photons , is not so sensitive to details of models and should be useful as a test of the existence of late internal dissipation during the shallow - decay phase . in this work",
    ", we have investigated the eic emission both analytically and numerically and demonstrated that the eic flux may become larger than the ssc flux around the end time of the shallow - decay phase .",
    "the eic peak is typically expected at @xmath291  gev , and the eic emission typically has a steeper light curve than in the x - ray one , but a shallower one when the x - ray light curve shows a sudden decline .",
    "hence , it would be possible to distinguish it from the other possibilities such as ssc components from the early and late jets .",
    "we also expect that it is easier for the synchrotron and ssc components to dominate at very earlier times .",
    "although the detectability depends on the parameters and on the ebl , ground - based gamma - ray observatories , such as magic , veritas , hess , cta and hawc , would be important tools in the search for such signals .",
    "very high energy gamma rays from grbs have not been firmly observed so far  @xcite and the event rate of nearby bursts is not large .",
    "( for example , the rate of grbs occurring at within @xmath292 is estimated as @xmath293  a few events per year  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . ) nevertheless , once sufficiently fast follow - up observations are successful for nearby events , cherenkov telescopes with a low - energy threshold ( @xmath168  gev ) may allow us to have good photon statistics thanks to their high sensitivities",
    ". theoretical predictions of the eic emission are testable once parameters are specified from observations , and the strategy for testing the model is as follows .",
    "first , one determines the relevant standard afterglow parameters for the early flow . when afterglows are well observed at optical ( and/or x - ray )",
    "bands , the parameters such as @xmath294 , @xmath84 , @xmath93 and @xmath85 are determined in the context of the standard external fs theory . at the same time , parameters on the late prompt emission , such as @xmath295 and @xmath135 and @xmath35 , can also be determined from observations at x - ray ( and/or optical ) bands . with those parameters , both the eic and ssc emissions",
    "are calculated and can be compared to high - energy observations . even non - detections would provide useful constraints on the models , especially for grbs with a strong plateau or shallow - decay emission .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that grb afterglows seem to be fairly diverse   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although grbs with a shallow - decay emission may be explained by a late jet from the long - lasting central engine , some grbs do not show the shallow decay and can be explained by the standard afterglow model , where the synchrotron or ssc emission is expected to be dominant .",
    "for this reason , multi - wavelength observations from radio to gamma rays are important for comprehensive studies of grb afterglows .",
