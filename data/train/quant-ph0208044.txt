    "vitanov and stenholm @xcite investigated the effect of raman detuning on the final state population in stirap starting from one of the two lower states .",
    "they used two delayed gaussian pulses for this purpose .",
    "they found that , as the detuning increases , the final state population decreases .",
    "@xcite used two contemporary chirped pulses and investigated how the final state population varies with the chirp rate of the pulses .",

    "[ relphase ] , we have shown the time - dependence of @xmath51 . clearly , the phase at the long time limit becomes constant .",

    "note that for intermediate times , the level @xmath3 gets populated .",
    "thus the atomic system initially in the state @xmath52 no longer remains confined in the two - dimensional hilbert plane of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "rather , it travels through the three - dimensional hilbert space of the levels @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and finally comes back to the initial space of states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but with a _ different composition _ of them .    from the above discussions , one can infer that the amount of rotation can be suitably controlled by the one - photon detuning parameter @xmath48 . for example , for @xmath53 , one can prepare an equal superposition state of the levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 with phase @xmath54 ( see inset , fig .  [ detune ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that for @xmath55 , the level @xmath3 remains populated at large times .",
    "so large values of the detuning @xmath48 are needed for proper qubit rotation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the time separation @xmath32 between the pulses affects the qubit rotation as shown in fig .",
    "[ time ] which depicts the variation of populations in @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath32 .",

    "( [ dotequ ] ) , putting @xmath56 @xmath14 @xcite . however , all these solutions are for @xmath49 . for @xmath57 ,",
    "as discussed in the present section , it is very difficult to obtain the solution analytically .",
    "the relative amplitude of the two pulses is expected to determine the final state of the atom .",
    "we continue to keep both the pulses equally detuned by an amount of @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "[ amplia ] , we show the long time behavior of populations in the levels @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 as functions of the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "we present results for both the cases when the atom starts in the state @xmath1 and the state @xmath52 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that the population in the level @xmath3 is negligible for large times .",
    "the population is redistributed in the levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , a different superposition is created at the end of evolution .",
    "the composition varies if one changes the ratio @xmath58 .",
    "for example , for @xmath59 , one gets an equal superposition of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , for @xmath46 .",
    "it is thus clear that the ratio of the amplitudes of the two pulses can serve as a control parameter for producing rotation of a qubit .",
    "note that for @xmath49 and @xmath60 only orthogonal rotation of the qubit is possible for all values of @xmath61 [ see fig .",
    "[ amplib ] ] .",
    "we will now discuss how the amount of qubit rotation can be controlled by the relative phase @xmath33 between the two pulses .",
    "we work under the two - photon resonance condition and take the pulses to have equal amplitudes .",
    "the periodic dependence of the populations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on @xmath33 in the long time limit for the initial condition ( [ condi ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "thus the relative phase of the input pulses can be used as an useful control parameter for the qubit rotation .",
    "it should be mentioned here that , if @xmath49 , i.e. , if the atom is initially prepared in the state @xmath1 , then there is no @xmath33-dependence of the populations in the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the eqs .",
    "( [ dotequ ] ) can be redefined with an extra complex phase term in the probability amplitudes .",
    "for example , the replacements @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 keep the form of the equations unchanged .",
    "thus @xmath33 does not show up in the square moduli of these amplitudes .",
    "however , the wave functions would be different for different values of @xmath33 and the probability amplitudes become different .",
    "thus , if the atom is initially in the state @xmath1 , then a change in @xmath33 can not produce arbitrary rotation of @xmath1 .",
    "we write the state orthogonal to @xmath52 [ eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) ] as @xmath65 when the detuning @xmath48 of the pulses becomes much larger than the pulse amplitudes , then one can ignore the time variation of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "( [ dotequ ] ) in the ( @xmath67 ) basis can be written as @xmath68 where , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "thus the three - level atomic system can be approximated as a two - level system with effective rabi - frequency @xmath72 and effective detuning @xmath73 [ eq .  ( [ twolev ] ) ] .",
    "it is well - known that in a two - level atomic system , if detuning of the pulse is much larger than the pulse amplitude , then the induced polarization of the atom follows the time - evolution of the population term @xcite .",
    "this is referred to as adiabatic following .",
    "similarly , if @xmath74 , then , adiabatic following occurs in a three - level system also .",
    "we present the exact and two - level approximated results for the variation of the populations in @xmath1 and @xmath2 in figs .",
    "[ new4a ] and [ new4b ] for different values of @xmath48 . clearly , for smaller values of @xmath48 , the two - level approximation is not valid .",
    "but still _ rotation of the qubit occurs_. only when @xmath75 , exact numerical result and two - level approximated result match , as we stated earlier .",
    "this is because , in this case , the level @xmath3 is hardly populated during the evolution and the system thereby keeps itself confined in the hilbert plane of @xmath76 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus the rotation of a qubit can be obtained even for values of @xmath48 for which two - level approximation is not valid .",
    "we further address the question of nonadiabaticity .",
    "the evolution of a quantum system is called adiabatic , if the populations of the adiabatic states ( which are the eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian ) remain constant during the evolution .",
    "this condition requires that the nonadiabatic coupling between the adiabatic states is much smaller than their energy difference @xcite . to attain this",
    ", the hamiltonian should be smoothly varying with time . in a three level @xmath0 system ,",
    "if one uses two smoothly varying pulses with large amplitudes in counterintuitive sequence , then the complete transfer of population occurs between the two lower lying levels of the system and also the evolution of the system becomes adiabatic @xcite .",
    "one has to use the pulses in raman resonance .",
    "even when the pulses are one - photon resonant , then for large enough values of the pulse amplitudes the evolution becomes adiabatic . in this light",
    "we examine the nonadiabaticity of the process of rotation described here .",
    "the hamiltonian ( under the conditions @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) can be written in the ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) basis as @xmath77 the eigenstates ( or the adiabatic states ) of @xmath78 are given by ,    @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 the state ( [ adiaa ] ) is the well - known coherent population trapping state .",
    "it is independent of the two - photon detuning .",
    "we have shown the temporal variation of the populations in these adiabatic states in fig .",
    "[ explain ] .",
    "it is clear that during the course of evolution , transfer of population occurs between the states , namely @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus the nonadiabatic coupling is no more small enough to keep the process adiabatic .",
    "clearly the system evolves nonadiabatically in the chosen parameter domain .",
    "note that even when @xmath49 , for larger @xmath48 the evolution becomes nonadiabatic [ fig .",
    "[ detuneb ] ] for a constant value of @xmath61 .",
    "if the system were to stay in the adiabatic state defined by @xmath84 , then the final state population would be independent of the detuning .",
    "the @xmath48-dependence of the population in fig .",
    "[ detuneb ] implies that the dynamics of the system does not remain confined to the adiabatic state @xmath82 only .",
    "further note that for a given value of @xmath48 , large values of @xmath61 are required to make the evolution adiabatic .",
    "[ amplib ] supports the adiabatic result at large @xmath61 ( @xmath85 ) for @xmath55 , i.e. , the system remains essentially in the state ( [ adiaa ] ) .",
    "so far we have discussed how the one - photon detuning of the pulses can be used to produce rotation of the qubit .",
    "we now consider use of the chirped pulses for obtaining arbitrary qubit rotation .",
    "we also examine the simultaneous effects of chirping and one - photon detuning .",

    "we put @xmath44 , @xmath46 , and @xmath59 .",
    "we have seen from the temporal variation of populations in the levels @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( results not shown ) that populations in @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the long time limit becomes constant at a value depending on @xmath88 whereas the level @xmath3 remains unpopulated .",
    "therefore by changing the chirping rate @xmath88 , we produce arbitrary rotation to the state @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "[ linchirpa ] we show the variations of populations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the long time limit with the chirping parameter @xmath88 for different values of @xmath48 .",

    "[ linchirpa ] , it is also clear that for a constant value of @xmath88 , one can have different rotation for different values of detuning parameter @xmath48 .",
    "thus by varying either @xmath48 [ or @xmath88 ] while keeping @xmath88 [ or @xmath48 ] constant , one has a way to achieve arbitrary rotation to the qubit state @xmath52 .",

    "clearly , in this case also , rotation occurs irrespective of relative sign of @xmath94 s and @xmath48 .",
    "however , if relative sign changes , amount of rotation also changes .",
    "we note that , for @xmath55 , both kinds of chirping do not provide any rotation to a general superposition state of the qubit @xmath95 .",

    "in conclusion , we have examined how one can produce a general rotation of the qubit in a superposition of the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 by using the nonadiabatic evolution .",
    "two delayed pulses in two - photon resonance have been employed for this purpose . we have found that each of the parameters - one - photon detuning , amplitudes , phases , and chirpings of the two pulses can provide proper control of the qubit rotation .",

    "<S> we show how one can perform arbitrary rotation of any qubit , using delayed laser pulses through nonadiabatic evolution , i.e. , via transitions among the adiabatic states . </S>",
    "<S> we use a double-@xmath0 scheme and use a set of control parameters such as detuning , ratio of pulse amplitudes , time separation of the two pulses for realizing different rotations of the qubit . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the effect of different kinds of chirping , namely linear chirping and hyperbolic tangent chirping . </S>",
    "<S> our work using nonadiabatic evolution adds to the flexibility in the implementation of logic gate operations and shows how to achieve control of quantum systems by using different types of pulses .    2 </S>"
