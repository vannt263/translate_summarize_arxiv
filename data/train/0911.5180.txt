    "one distinct property of quantum entanglement from other classical correlations is its restricted sharability . for instance , if a pair of parties in a multipartite quantum system share maximal entanglement , then they can share neither entanglement  @xcite nor classical correlations  @xcite with the rest .",
    "this is known as the _ monogamy of entanglement _  ( moe )  @xcite , and it has been shown that this restricted sharability of quantum entanglement can be used as a resource to distribute a secret key which is secure against unauthorized parties  @xcite .    whereas moe is a restricted property of entanglement in multipartite quantum systems , the sharability itself is about the bipartite entanglements among the parties in multipartite systems . in other words , it is inevitable to have a proper way of quantifying bipartite entanglement for a good description of the monogamy nature in multipartite quantum systems .",
    "for this reason , certain criteria of bipartite entanglement measure were recently proposed for a good description of the monogamy nature of entanglement in multipartite quantum systems  @xcite ; that is ,    * _ monotonicity _ : the property that ensures entanglement can not be increased under local operations and classical communications . *",

    "furthermore , although moe in multi - qubit systems is mathematically well - characterized in terms of concurrence , it is not generally true for other entanglement measures such as _ entanglement of formation _  ( eof )  @xcite . in other words , moe does not have ckw - type characterization in terms of eof , and this exposes the importance of the choice of a bipartite entanglement measure to characterize moe even in multi - qubit systems .",

    "thus , the conjecture we claimed here is highly reasonable because it has both numerical and analytical reasons .",
    "multipartite entanglement is known to have many inequivalent classes , which are not convertible to each other under _ stochastic local operations and classical communications _ ( slocc )  @xcite .",

    ", the existence of inequivalent classes of multipartite entanglement implies that the states from different classes are hardly comparable to each other in such a way of comparing a single parameter that quantifies their entanglement .",
    "this is one of the main difficulties in the study of multipartite entanglement .",
    "whereas the interconvertibility of quantum states under slocc gives us an operational way to classify multipartite entanglement , entangled states from different classes can also reveal different characters with respect to their monogamy and polygamy properties .",

    "its dual inequalities are saturated by w - class states , while the differences between terms in the inequalities can assume their largest values for ghz - class states .",
    "in other words , monogamy and polygamy of multipartite entanglement can also be used for an analytical characterization of entanglement in multipartite quantum systems .",
    "the class of monogamy and polygamy inequalities of multi - qubit entanglement we provided here consists of infinitely many inequalities parameterized by @xmath0 , and each inequality is based on the distinct character of rnyi-@xmath0 entropy with respect to @xmath0 .",
