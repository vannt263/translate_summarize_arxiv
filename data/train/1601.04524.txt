    "the concept of dark matter is attracting the attention of many people .",
    "some scholars are fascinated by the dark matter , but bewildered by the concept at the same time .",
    "we do not know what the dark matter is , how it is generated , where it exists in , and whether it is one particle .",
    "there is neither the effective theory with practical guidance , nor the systematic observational and experimental methods yet . until recently the appearance of the electromagnetic and gravitational theories describing with the complex octonion replies to some of these puzzles .",
    "according to this field theory , a few features of dark matter are able to be predicted , including the origin , particle category , existence region , and force and so forth .    in 1932 , jan oort postulated it was possible that one ` non - visible form of matter ' might exist in the galaxy @xcite , accounting for the orbital velocities of stars in the milky way . in 1933",
    ", fritz zwicky inferred that there might be one ` missing mass ' in the galaxy cluster @xcite , by means of the observation on the velocities of galaxies in clusters . in 1939 , in his ph.d .",
    "thesis , horace w. babcock reported the measurements of the rotation curve for the andromeda nebula .    in the late 1960s and early 1970s ,",
    "vera rubin measured a lot of galactic rotation curves , attributing the anomalous observations to the existence of dark matter .",
    "the observations and calculations of vera rubin and kent ford showed that most galaxies contain about six times as much mass of ` dark matter ' as that of ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "subsequently many observations of other astronomers corroborate the presence of dark matter in the universe @xcite . by the 1980s",
    ", the observation of galactic rotation curves has been collecting over the decades , providing the robust observational evidence for the existence of dark matter @xcite . as a result",
    ", most astrophysicists accepted the viewpoint of the existence of dark matter eventually @xcite .      in recent years , the astronomers make a survey of dark matter on a large scale , achieving a number of observations .",
    "meanwhile the alternative approaches are increasing continuously . at present , the observation approach to the detection of dark matter consists of the gravitational lensing @xcite , the galactic rotation curve of the spiral galaxy @xcite , the velocity dispersions of galaxies in the galaxy cluster ( or stars in the galaxy ) @xcite , the x - ray hot gas hydrostatic @xcite in the galaxy or cluster , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect of the cluster @xcite and so forth .",
    "those observation approaches make numerous and conclusive measurements , resulting in more and more scholars to accept the view point related to the existence of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the observational achievements in the astronomy empower the scholars to undertake some correlative investigations in the laboratory , attempting to discover dark matter on the microscopic scale .",
    "presently the experiments to detect dark matter in the lab can be divided into two classes : direct detection experiments , and indirect detection experiments .",
    "( 1 ) direct detection experiment .",
    "the majority of present experiments mainly use one of two detectors : cryogenic detectors , and noble liquid detectors .",
    "some with the cryogenic detector embody cdms @xcite , cresst @xcite , ededweiss @xcite , and eureca @xcite and so on .",
    "some others with the cryogenic detector contain zeplin @xcite , xenon @xcite , deap @xcite , ardm @xcite , warp @xcite , darkside @xcite , lux @xcite , and pandax @xcite and so forth .",
    "other detection experiments include simple @xcite and picasso @xcite and so on .",
    "( 2 ) indirect detection experiment .",
    "the most experiments search for the products ( the gamma rays and particle - antiparticle pairs and so on ) of dark matter annihilation or decay .",
    "they cover pamela @xcite and ams @xcite on the international space station and so on .",
    "however there is a big difference between the observation and experiment .",
    "by contrast with the achievement that there are a lot of astronomic observations , the experiments in the laboratory have not made compelling and robust measurements up to now .",
    "similarly there is not the physics or astronomic theory capable of practical guidance to the detection experiments deal with dark matter either .",
    "we are still only at the foothills of pursuing the effect theory of dark matter .      for the observations of galaxies and clusters ,",
    "some alternative theories proposed to account for ` missing mass ' can be divided into two classes : modified theories , and dark matter theories .",
    "\\(1 ) modified theory .",
    "these theories claim that it is possible to modify or extend the existing theories , explaining the galaxy observations without the need for a large amount of undetected matter .",
    "these main theories are as follows .",
    "( i ) modified newtonian dynamics .",
    "most of these theories deem that the gravitational theories established by i. newton and a. einstein are not perfect enough , so it is necessary to modify the laws of gravity @xcite , solving the problem about the galactic rotation curves and so forth .",
    "( ii ) quantum gravity .",
    "these theories attempt to unify the gravitational theory and the quantum theory and so on , including the loop quantum gravity @xcite , superstring theory @xcite , and m - theory @xcite and so on .",
    "( iii ) quantum vacuum . in the quantum vacuum @xcite , under certain conditions , the virtual gravitational dipoles can produce the extra gravity attributing to the dark matter usually .",
    "( iv ) topological defeats .",
    "the topology of quantum fields may possess some primordial defects , containing the energy and therefore additionally gravitating towards the galaxy @xcite .",
    "( v ) mass in extra dimension . in certain multidimensional theories",
    "@xcite , the gravitational force is the unique force capable of effects across all the various extra dimensions , but the forces of other fundamental fields ( electromagnetism , strong interaction , and weak interaction ) would not be able to cross into extra dimensions .",
    "( vi ) quantised inertia .",
    "the theory reckons that the inertia is assumed to be due to the effect of horizons on unruh radiation , resulting in the galaxy rotation @xcite without dark matter .",
    "unfortunately these categories of modified theories did not successfully explain the observations of galaxy cluster up to now .",
    "\\(2 ) dark matter theory .",
    "these theories believe that there may be the undetected matter at the moment , including the dark matter and dark energy @xcite and so on . at present , the categories of these theories are most widely accepted , playing a central role in the explanation of the anomalies in observed galactic rotation .",
    "there are three kinds of main theories as follows .",
    "( i ) dark matter theory .",
    "the dark matter is still one unsolved puzzle in essence . according to the moving velocity",
    "refer to the particles , dark matter can be approximately divided into three classes : cold , warm , and hot dark matter . in the dark matter theory ,",
    "the most widely discussed model is based on the cold dark matter hypothesis , and the corresponding particle is one weakly interacting massive particle @xcite .",
    "( ii ) grand unification theory .",
    "the axion @xcite is one hypothetical elementary particle , trying to figure out the strong cp problem in the quantum chromodynamics .",
    "a part of axions may possess a low mass within a specific range , forming an additional structure at the galactic scale , and attempting to explain the dark matter puzzle .",
    "( iii ) supersymmetric theory .",
    "the supersymmetric theory is the foundation of supergravity theory and of superstring theory .",
    "its hypothetical particle , sterile neutrino @xcite , is not able to interact via any of the fundamental interactions except gravity , and is one candidate of dark matter particles .",
    "moreover a few scholars applied the quaternion and octonion to study various properties of dark matters .",
    "j. c. maxwell was the first to use the quaternion to study the physics properties of electromagnetic field .",
    "undoubtedly it inspires other scholars to apply the quaternion and octonion to explore the electromagnetic and gravitational theories , and even the field theory relevant to the dark matter . in some described theories ,",
    "the coordinates of quaternion or of octonion can even be complex numbers @xcite . at the moment ,",
    "they are called as the complex quaternion or octonion respectively .",
    "a few scholars study the physics properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields by means of the complex quaternion and octonion .",
    "t. anastassiu @xmath0 . explored the electromagnetic feature with the complex quaternion @xcite .",
    "k. morita studied the quaternion field theory @xcite .",
    "f. a. doria used the complex quaternion to depict the gravitational theory @xcite .",
    "v. majernik deduced the modified maxwell - like gravitational field equations with the complex quaternion @xcite .",
    "m. gogberashvili applied the complex octonion to research the electromagnetic field equations @xcite . v.",
    "l. mironov @xmath0 . described the electromagnetic field equations and related features by the algebra of octonions @xcite .",
    "s. demir made use of the octonion to discuss the gravitational field equations and relevant properties @xcite .",
    "further a part of scholars explore the physics properties of dark matter by means of the quaternion and octonion .",
    "s. p. brumby @xmath0 . presented some global consequences of a model quaternionic quantum field theory , making the quaternionic structure a dynamical quantity naturally leads to the prediction of cosmic strings and non - baryonic hot dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "taking the complex nature of quantum mechanics , which observed as a low energy effect of a broken quaternionic theory , the authors @xcite explored the possibility that dark matter may arise as a consequence of the underlying quaternionic structure to the universe .",
    "v. majernik @xcite described a model of the universe consisting of a mixture of the ordinary matter and a so - called cosmic quaternionic field , investigating the interaction of the quaternionic field with the ordinary dark matter , and exerting a force on the moving dark matter which might possible create the dark matter in the early universe .",
    "s. furui expressed equivalently a dirac fermion as a 4-component spinor @xcite , which is a combination of two quaternions . and",
    "the latter can be treated as an octonion .",
    "the octonion possesses the triality symmetry , which relates three sets of spinors and two sets of vectors",
    ". if the electromagnetic interaction is sensitive to the triality symmetry ( i.e. em probe selects one triality sector ) , electromagnetic signals from the 5-transformed world would not be detected , and be treated as the dark matter . reconstructing a left - handed fermion and a right - handed fermion in terms of the quaternion in the yang - mills lagrangian , the author @xcite discussed the axial anomaly and the triality symmetry of octonion . according to the triality selection rules of octonions ,",
    "the pauli spinor is treated as a quaternion , and the dirac spinor is treated as an octonion .",
    "therefore the author @xcite assumed the dark matter may be able to be interpreted as matter emitting photons in a different triality sector , rather than that of electromagnetic probes in the world .",
    "b. c. chanyal @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the role of octonions in various unified field theories associated with the dyon and dark matter , reconstructing the field equations of hot and cold dark matter by means of split octonions .      making a detailed comparison and analysis of preceding studies , a few primal problems of these theories",
    "are found as follows .",
    "( 1 ) common origin . up to now",
    ", the existing theories have not unified the dark matter and ordinary matter into one single field theory , and not found the common origin of dark matters and ordinary matters yet .",
    "however in the paper , the electromagnetic field accompanies with one adjoint - field ( in section 3 ) , which feature is partly similar to that of gravitational field .",
    "if the electromagnetic adjoint - field is chosen as the dark matter field , the dark matter and ordinary matter possess the same integrating function of field potential .",
    "in other words , for the complex octonion integrating function of field potential , the dark matter and ordinary matter have one common origin , simplifying the theoretical model of dark matter significantly .",
    "( 2 ) additional contribution .",
    "so far the existing theories can not deduce the contribution of dark matter to the field equations , linear momentum , angular momentum , energy , torque , force , and power and so forth .",
    "but in the paper , the emergence of the dark matter is accompanied by the existence of electromagnetic field . in case",
    "there are both electromagnetic and gravitational fields , it is capable of inferring the field theory related to the dark matter , measuring and calculating the additional contribution of dark matter field in the complex quaternion space .",
    "( 3 ) particle category .",
    "the existing theories are not able to determine the particle category of dark matter until now . in the paper ,",
    "the dark matter particle is independent of the ordinary matter particle . and it is able to predict that the dark matter has only three sorts of particles , for the double - source particles .",
    "the first sort of dark matter particle carries the mass ; the second carries the electric charge ; the third carries neither the mass nor the electric charge .    making use of the complex octonion space and the complex quaternion operator , it is propitious to describe the physics properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "when the operator is extended from the complex quaternion operator to the complex octonion operator , the paper is appropriate for exploring not only the electromagnetic and gravitational fields , but also the electromagnetic and gravitational adjoint - fields .",
    "the electromagnetic adjoint - field possesses a part of physics properties of gravitational field , and can be chosen as one competitive candidate of dark matter field .",
