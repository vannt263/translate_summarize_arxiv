    "it is widely accepted that a galactic bar will trigger a rearrangement of the stellar and gaseous disk , but the bar s effect on the dark halo is more controversial .",
    "linear hamiltonian perturbation theory suggests that the transfer of angular momentum drives post - formation galaxy evolution , and is mediated by orbits that are in resonance with quasi - periodic perturbers . in the case of a barred galaxy , substantial amounts of angular momentum are transferred from the bar to the halo via resonant interactions between the bar pattern speed and the orbits of dark matter particles in the inner halo ( lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 , tremaine & weinberg 1984 , athanassoula 2000 ) . the bar is a huge , organized source of angular momentum , and the transfer of this angular momentum from the bar to the disk  halo system causes the galaxy to evolve .",
    "the coupling between the bar and halo , and the subsequent evolution of both components , in particular the central dark matter density profile , has been conclusively shown in idealized numerical experiments ( weinberg & katz 2002 , hereafter paper i , weinberg & katz 2003 , hereafter paper ii ) .    unfortunately , attempts to study bar - halo interactions using fully self - consistent n - body simulations have lead to wildly different conclusions .",
    "for example , one robust prediction of this mechanism is that the bar pattern speed slows as it loses angular momentum to the halo , if the bar moment of inertia remains constant ( tremaine & weinberg 1984 , weinberg 1985 ) . while the bar does appear to slow in most n - body simulations ( athanassoula 2000 , hernquist & weinberg 1992 , sellwood 2002 , debattista & sellwood 2000 ) , in others it does not ( valenzuela & klypin 2002 , hereafter vk ) .",
    "the discrepancy could be caused by differences in the numerical techniques , some of which might be incapable of following the important physical processes , or to differences in the disk and halo models .",
    "these could affect either the transfer of angular momentum from the bar to the halo , the evolution of the bar moment of inertia , or both .    even for simulations that produce a slowing bar ,",
    "the effect on the dark matter halo remains a point of contention .",
    "we have argued that resonant coupling between the bar and halo can flatten central dark matter density cusps ( hernquist & weinberg 1992 , paper i , paper ii ) . the inner halo orbits gain enough angular momentum to move them to larger time - averaged radii , which slowly removes the central density cusp .",
    "this causes the center to lose gravitational support and accelerates the flattening .",
    "however , these results rely on idealized n - body simulations , and to date there has been only one fully self - consistent simulation that has explicitly shown the decrease in the halo central density due to this process .",
    "such evolution can be seen in figures 8 and 12 of athanassoula ( 2003 ) although not mentioned in the text , but other published simulations show that the central density either remains unchanged ( vk ) or increases ( sellwood 2002 ) .",
    "this has led many dynamicists to incorrectly conclude that resonant interactions are unimportant in realistic galaxy evolution , even though resonant dynamics has been shown to be crucial for bar formation ( athanassoula 2002 ) .",
    "clearly , one needs to verify the predictions of linear hamiltonian perturbation theory and those of idealized n - body simulations using realistic , high - resolution , fully self - consistent n - body simulations .",
    "this paper is one in a series designed to study bar - induced halo evolution using realistic initial conditions and a state - of - the - art n - body code that minimizes small scale noise and fully resolves the galaxy disk .",
    "paper i ( weinberg & katz 2002 ) applied the concept of bar - halo interactions to the evolution of the halo density profile using idealized n - body simulations .",
    "( weinberg & katz 2003 ) deals with common misconceptions about resonant dynamics and conducts experiments to show that the predictions of linear hamiltonian perturbation theory pertain to idealized rigid bar and halo simulations . in this work ( paper iii ) , we attack the fully self - consistent problem and demonstrate that resonant dynamics still applies to this regime .",
    "we show that resonant interactions between the bar pattern speed and orbits in the halo are critical to the evolution of a fully self - consistent n - body experiment .",
    "our fiducial simulation has a bar length of about one disk scale length .",
    "this bar length is comparable to those of recent bar - formation simulations ( vk , sellwood 2002 , athanassoula 2003 ) .",
    "using our low noise n - body approach , we hope to better understand the large differences among published self - consistent n - body simulations .",
    "while it is difficult to definitively determine the cause of the differences without direct access to either their initial conditions or numerical codes , we argue that where differences exist , they are attributable to subtle numerical artifacts that destroy the important resonant dynamical processes .",
    "these processes are well described by linear perturbation theory , but the effect can be underestimated either by compromising the resonant potential through numerical noise , by having insufficient phase space coverage near the resonance , or by artificially scattering the resonant orbit reservoir . we address the problems inherent to using any n - body technique to track resonant dynamics in general , and discuss the probable shortcomings of a few recent self - consistent simulations in the discussion section .    correctly following",
    "the physics on the ` microscopic ' level of an individual orbit response can have effects on a galactic scale with cosmological implications .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos in every mass regime are thought to form with a characteristic density profile , expressed as @xmath0 ( navarro et al 1997 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "while disagreements remain on the precise value of the central slope , @xmath1 , which range between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( moore et al 1998 , power et al 2002 ) , there is a consensus that primordial dark matter halos are universally cuspy .",
    "this prediction is testable using the rotation curves of galaxies . by determining the radial portion of the gravitational potential , rotation curves when combined with light profiles",
    "can constrain both luminous and dark matter density profiles .",
    "though this technique suffers from degeneracies in interpretation , many real dark matter halos appear to be much less cuspy than those predicted by standard cdm ( de blok et .",
    "2001 , mcgaugh 2000 , swaters et .",
    "al . 2002 ) , and some are even consistent with a flat central profile , or density core.    if the resonant dynamic processes described above occur in real galaxies and if bars are a ubiquitous phase of early galaxy evolution , the cusp  core controversy could be reconciled through subsequent bar - halo interactions . in this scenario ,",
    "primordial disks form in a cuspy dark matter halo .",
    "this proto - galactic disk is dynamically cold , making it very susceptible to bar formation .",
    "such young galaxies are subject to repeated satellite encounters ( tth & ostriker 1992 , steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) , and the first substantial one will likely excite a large bar in the disk ( binney & tremaine 1987 , walker , mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "the length of the bar will depend on the mass and distance of the satellite , i.e. the torque applied by an external quadrupole .",
    "the typical bar induced by this process will be much larger than those formed through internal disk instabilities , perhaps even encompassing the entire disk .",
    "the number of halo orbits commensurate with the bar pattern speed increases as the bar size increases ; for a massive primordial bar , the reservoir of resonant halo orbits stretches from deep inside the halo cusp to well outside the disk , allowing a broad range of radii to accept angular momentum via resonant exchange . in idealized calculations ,",
    "the torque from a primordial bar can destroy an nfw cusp out to as much as half the bar radius ( paper i , paper ii ) .    in this paper",
    "we emphasize moderate strength , scale - length - sized bars , so our results set a @xmath4 @xmath5 to the halo evolution that would be induced by tidal encounters in proto - disks .",
    "present - day galaxies have smaller , weaker bars than those studied here and hence the present - day effects could be smaller .",
    "however , sellwood ( 2002 ) argues that both at high and low red shift , bar sizes are restricted to the rising part of the rotation curve ; this limits bar sizes to be less than a disk scale length , thus invalidating the primordial scenario outlined above .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that this is not true if the bars are triggered externally by forming a long lived bar over four disk scale lengths in size .",
    "in addition , athanassoula ( 2003 ) also forms bars of this size without having to resort to external triggers .",
    "furthermore , jogee et al ( 2002 ) show that the lengths of even local bars are severely underestimated , and can extend to beyond the disk scale length .",
    "therefore , the scenario we outlined above remains a valid one .",
    "we find that a bar with sizes of a disk scale length @xmath6 remove dark matter cusps out to nearly 1/3 of the initial disk scale length using simulations with 5 million equal mass dark matter halo particles within the virial radius .",
    "the orbits in the central regions of the halo gain enough angular momentum to remove the cusp .",
    "we demonstrate the robustness of this result by obtaining the same result with a simulation that uses 10 million particles .",
    "furthermore , in agreement with the predictions of linear hamiltonian perturbation theory , both these fully self - consistent simulations show that low - order resonances are responsible for the transfer of angular momentum from the bar to the halo .",
    "we explicitly show that the angular momentum is deposited at discrete resonances in phase space , which counters some claims that resonant dynamics is only important in idealized situations . for our self - consistent field ( scf )",
    "code , we find that simulations using only 1 million particles have insufficient phase space resolution ( paper ii ) and too much discreteness noise to resolve the important resonances , and hence can not follow the relevant bar - halo physics correctly",
    ". the required number of particles may be even higher for other numerical n - body techniques , which have more small scale noise .",
    "interactions with satellites and more distant group members can also drive resonant angular momentum exchange , but are more complicated since they involve more disparate time scales .",
    "it is likely that such simulations would require many more particles than the simple bar perturbation case studied here .",
    "we organize this paper as follows .",
    " 1 describes the models ,  2 reviews the important physical processes ,  3 outlines our n - body technique , how we realize our initial conditions and the specific set of experiments we perform .",
    "we present our results in  4 , where we describe the bulk changes to the system , discuss the angular momentum exchange , identify the resonant interactions responsible for the halo evolution , and discuss the effect on the both the halo and disk density profiles .",
    " 5 investigates whether our results are effected by numerical artifacts : we confirm that the system is stable against centering instabilities , explore the effect of the bar formation mechanism , and discuss the effect of particle number .",
    "we present the implications of our results in  6 , where we detail to what extent our final evolved halos resemble observed galaxies , and discuss the reasons for any disagreements with past work .",
    " 7 summarizes and outlines future work .",
    "here we outline the physical processes and numerical considerations important to the study of bar interactions . a much more detailed discussion can be found in  2 of paper ii . in a near - equilibrium galaxy ,",
    "a global and lasting change in any conserved quantity can only occur at resonances , integer commensurabilities between orbital frequencies and a perturbation frequency .",
    "a bar is a natural rotating disturbance that resonantly exchanges angular momentum with both halo and disk orbits . to an observer sitting on the bar ,",
    "these commensurate orbits describe closed , non - axisymmetric figures .",
    "because the figures are non - axisymmetric , they will be torqued by the bar .",
    "orbits that are slowly precessing in the bar frame , on either side of the commensurability , can also receive a torque for a finite time .",
    "but no matter how slowly an orbit processes , if one waits long enough in a fixed potential with a constant bar pattern speed , the slow precession of the orbit eventually will describe an axisymmetric figure and would produce zero net torque . however , this time will be longer than times of interest in galaxy evolution , so in a practical sense , many orbits will be torqued .",
    "in addition , the bar pattern speed and gravitational potential are slowly evolving and , therefore , a precessing orbit may become closed and begin precessing in the opposite direction in response to this slow change .",
    "such an orbit has _",
    "passed through the resonance .",
    "_ at the point that the orbit is closed , adiabatic invariance is broken and the orbit is sensitive to the gravitational attraction of the bar through the potential associated with the resonance .",
    "only those orbits that pass through the resonance irreversibly change their actions .",
    "the galaxy equilibrium as a whole then slowly evolves owing to these changes , and this brings fresh orbits through the resonance to continue the evolution .",
    "the fractional change in the angular momentum of an individual orbit is antisymmetric about location of the resonance .",
    "unless there is a gradient in phase space , as the resonance sweeps through the system orbits will pass through the resonance in both directions , and the sum of these individual changes over the ensemble of orbits containing the resonance will cancel ( e.g. weinberg 2001 ) .",
    "a phase space gradient causes an incomplete cancellation that gives rise to a net torque .",
    "the total angular momentum gains and losses at a given time for individual orbits are first order in the bar amplitude , while the net change in the halo s angular momentum is second order and results from the near cancellation of this first order effect .",
    "the specific net change , therefore , is much smaller than the average change for an individual orbit .",
    "a minimum requirement to accurately model resonant dynamics is that the resonant potential is well - populated by particle orbits . since the change in any individual orbit as it passes through the resonance depends on the phase of the orbit , an accurate result relies on a dense sampling in phase . for a given resonant potential",
    ", there is a critical number of particles , @xmath7 , required to resolve the region near the resonance such that the response is represented by contributions from orbits at many phases . as explained in the previous paragraph ,",
    "the change in the actions of any one orbit is first order in the bar amplitude , but these changes must cancel over the ensemble of orbits , leaving only the smaller second - order contributions that are responsible for long - term halo evolution .",
    "if phase space is incompletely sampled , the first - order changes will _ not _ cancel , but will produce random fluctuations and the real resonance - driven evolution will not occur .",
    "even when the resonance potential is well - resolved by particle orbits , it may still be rendered ineffective if potential fluctuations caused by the finite - number of particles swamp the resonant potential .",
    "it is possible to determine the power in the poisson noise at any scale by fourier analysis , or more generally from any orthonormal basis expansion that satisfies the poisson equation in an axisymmetric coordinate system ( weinberg 1998 ) . to resolve the resonance potential in the basis expansion , we require that the power in the coefficients of the halo response be greater than the power in the noise .",
    "since a basis expansion is at the heart of our potential solver , we can use this signal - to - noise criterion to determine the critical number of particles needed to resolve the resonance potential for any expansion term used in our n - body simulation ( see paper ii ) .",
    "noise on interparticle scales scatters orbits from their original trajectories and leads to a diffusion time scale that is unphysically short .",
    "if the diffusion time is shorter than the time that potentially resonant orbits would need to pass through a resonance driven by the slow evolution of the galaxy , the resonance will cease to exist . without these stable , resonant orbits ,",
    "the exchange of angular momentum through this mechanism can not take place .",
    "this diffusion on interparticle scales , i.e. _ two - body relaxation _ , is astronomically negligible for our bar  halo simulations , but can be a significant problem for other studies due to the numerical noise present in many n - body potential solvers . since the phase - space width of the resonance is proportional to the strength of the bar perturbation , the time scale for drifting across the resonance can be a small fraction of the two - body relaxation time scale . however , direct summation , tree , and grid - based codes are all particularly prone to generating small - scale noise and are thus quite susceptible to rapid orbit diffusion .",
    "the only remedy is to increase the particle number while keeping the resolution fixed , thereby pushing the simulation toward the collisionless limit .",
    "expansion codes still suffer from relaxation that will diffuse orbits in principle , but the _ small - scale _ noise is removed by truncating the expansion .",
    "the disk and dark matter halo are evolved using a 3-dimensional self - consistent field ( scf ) code ( weinberg 1999 ) . in most n - body methods ,",
    "it is either the gravitational softening introduced to decrease two - body scattering , or the grid cell size that determines the spatial resolution . in such codes , the number of spatial resolution elements within the simulation volume determines the effective number of degrees of freedom , typically a very large number .",
    "scf codes ( earn & sellwood 1995 , clutton - brock 1972 , 1973 , kalnajs 1976 , polachenko & shukmann 1981 , friedman & polyachenko 1984 , hernquist & ostriker 1992 , hernquist , sigurdsson , & bryan 1995 , brown & papaloizou 1998 , earn 1996 , allen , palmer , & papaloizou 1990 , saha 1993 ) limit the number of degrees of freedom to decrease the small - scale noise , making this class of code ideal for the simulation of the long term evolution caused by resonant dynamics .",
    "our potential solver exploits properties of the sturm - liouville equation to generate a numerical bi - orthogonal basis set whose lowest order basis function matches the equilibrium model ( weinberg 1999 ) .",
    "many important physical systems in quantum and classical dynamics reduce to the sturm - liouville ( sl ) form , @xmath8 -q(x ) \\phi(x ) } =   { \\lambda \\omega(x)\\phi(x)},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a constant and @xmath10 is a known function , called either the density or weighting function .",

    ". however , an abrupt truncation of the density profile at the virial radius leads to a poor equilibrium , given our assumed isotropic velocity distribution . to generate a better equilibrium , we compute a phase - space distribution function with an isotropic velocity distribution by eddington inversion ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) for the truncated halo and spherically averaged disk system combined .",

    "the existence of a bar in such an initially cuspy system is a relatively new result ; the large central mass of a cuspy halo can provide a barrier that prevents @xmath106 orbits from passing through the center ( binney & tremaine 1987 , polyachenko & polyachenko 1996 ) . by removing such a major bar orbit family ,",
    "this spherical potential barrier was thought to prevent the growth of a weak bar instability .",

    "as anticipated from the results of papers i and ii , the bar mediates this angular momentum transfer , both from the bar to the outer disk and from the disk to the halo .",
    "the bar loses @xmath137 over the course of the simulation , with about half being transferred to the remaining disk and half to the dark halo .",
    "figure [ fig : angmomdisk ] shows that most of the angular momentum loss within the disk occurs inside the radius of corotation , @xmath138 . however , this is less than the @xmath137 lost by the bar , which approximately extends out to the corotation radius .",
    "hence , the material not in the bar but within corotation gains about @xmath139 .",

    "is gained within corotation , @xmath143 between corotation and olr , and @xmath144 beyond olr .",
    "this qualitative behavior follows the expectations of linear theory .",
    "strong resonances in the outer disk and halo are responsible for most of the angular momentum exchange from the bar . in detail , however , things could more complicated .",
    "angular momentum could be exchanged between different parts of the halo and disk in addition to those processes implied by the simple angular momentum accounting above .",
    "for example , regions in the halo well beyond olr actually lose angular momentum , implying that some additional angular momentum exchange must occur .",
    "as described in  2 , near a resonance , the fractional change in the angular momentum of an individual orbit is first order in the perturbation , and the sign of the first - order changes are antisymmetric about the location of the resonance .",
    "the total angular momentum gains and losses at a given time for individual orbits are large , but the net change in the halo s angular momentum is second order , and results from the near cancellation of this first order effect .",
    "figure [ fig : angmomhalogain ] shows both the large instantaneous gains and losses of angular momentum by individual halo orbits versus time and the much smaller gains in angular momentum made by the entire halo , confirming these theoretical ideas .",
    "if an n - body system has the correct numerical characteristics to properly follow the important physical processes , linear perturbation theory predicts that angular momentum exchange will take place @xmath145 at confined islands in phase space , the regions that correspond to halo - bar resonances ( as described in  2 and paper ii ) .",

    "the resonant condition therefore describes a curve in @xmath152@xmath153 space .",

    "the main participants in this exchange are the corotation resonance ( @xmath161 ) , the outer lindblad resonance ( @xmath162 ) , and resonances at @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "figure [ fig : resplot ] shows the phase - space locations that dominate the angular momentum lost by the bar and are important for bar slowing .",
    "however , since halo orbits have differing amounts of angular momentum , the @xmath158 contours shown in figure [ fig : resplot ] are not useful for gauging the effects of angular momentum exchange on individual orbits or on the structure of the halo itself . in figure",
    "[ fig : resplotrel ] , we plot the relative change in angular momentum over the same time period as in figure [ fig : resplot ] .",
    "we quantified the relative angular momentum change by @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the initial total angular momentum of an orbit .",
    "the largest relative change in angular momentum takes place within the central region , and the bulk of this change can be attributed to the inner lindblad resonance ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the large relative gain in angular momentum by these central orbits causes the disruption of the halo cusp .      to interpret the effect of the bar on the halo",
    ", we must first assess the stability of the halo profile in the @xmath168 of a bar .",
    "figure [ fig : c5prof ] shows the change in the density profile for the 5.5 million particle , fixed disk potential experiment ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "there is no appreciable change in the halo density profile over 3 time units ( 3.9 gyr , 6.60 gyr ) .",
    "when a bar is induced via an external quadrupole ( @xmath170 ) , the halo density profile changes dramatically , as shown in figure [ fig : f5prof ] .",
    "after @xmath171 ( 1.3 gyr , 2.2 gyr ) , the halo profile begins to deviate from an nfw profile at @xmath172 virial units ( 97 pc , 500 pc ) , quickly flattening to a @xmath173 cusp . at @xmath174 ( 58 pc , 300 pc ) , the central halo density has decreased to half its original value .",
    "the bar - induced flattening continues to the end of the simulation at @xmath175 ( 2.93 gyr , 4.95 gyr ) , producing a core of about @xmath176 ( 170 pc , 900 pc ) .",
    "our experiments agree with the predictions of linear perturbation theory and with the idealized simulations of paper ii .",
    "these simulations investigate the halo evolution driven by the monopole and quadrupole terms of a rotating ellipsoidal bar with the same size , mass , and elongation as the the time average of the f series of experiments , in which the bar parameters remain fixed .",
    "the final density profile of this idealized simulation agrees with the fully self - consistent simulation ( @xmath170 ) , as plotted in figure [ fig : f5prof ] , which should be no surprise . since the torque is applied to the halo orbits by the gravitational potential of the bar , as long as the quadrupole part of this potential in the n - body simulation is well - represented by the form of the quadrupole used in paper ii , the evolution and net angular momentum exchange will be similar .",
    "although the core radii for the idealized simulation and @xmath170 _ are _ similar , the central density of the idealized experiment is about 1.7 times smaller than in @xmath170 .",
    "the increased flattening occurs in the idealized run because the quadrupole is fixed over the entire experiment , while in the fully self - consistent simulation , the quadrupole strength is negligible until @xmath177 ( 0.26 gyr , 0.44 gyr ) .",
    "the self - consistent bar structure changes only gradually after its initial formation , growing slightly more massive and more elongated as the galaxy evolves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bulkbar ] ) .",
    "the final rotation curve for this simulation , plotted in figure [ fig : rotcurve ] , shows that the disk density profile also evolves , becoming much more centrally concentrated as it responds to the loss of angular momentum .",
    "we plot the disk density profile explicitly in figure [ fig : evoldiskprof ] .",
    "the inner disk becomes more dense as the scale length shrinks by @xmath126 in response to angular momentum loss by the bar .",
    "now that we have presented our basic results , it is necessary to determine their numerical robustness .",
    "if the disk were pinned to the initial origin of the simulation , as in the idealized simulations in paper i , the evolution becomes sensitive to @xmath101 instabilities .",
    "as the halo evolves , random fluctuations produce a small offset between the halo and the disk . this offset adds linear momentum to the halo , further increasing the offset , and leading to a rapidly saturating instability that artificially amplifies the halo cusp evolution .",
    "paper i studied bar - induced halo evolution using an nfw halo and an external quadrupole designed to mimic a rigid rotating bar that was pinned to the origin throughout the simulation .",
    "this experiment had rapid halo evolution , although some fraction of it was a consequence of this centering artifact ( sellwood 2002 , paper ii ) .",
    "paper ii shows that including a consistent response of the external quadrupole to the halo removes this artifact and the rapid halo evolution persists .",
    "the mutual response of the disk and halo in our fully self - consistent simulations should @xmath179 act to damp this centering instability .",
    "each component of the system responds to off - center density perturbations , which conserves total linear momentum .",
    "hence , the fully self - consistent adjustment of the halo and disk centers prevents an @xmath101 instability that artificially arises from a fixed center . to be certain that the evolution is not affected by this numerical artifact , we reran our fiducial simulations excluding the @xmath101 term , i.e. including only @xmath180 .",
    "if our evolution were effected by centering , these experiments would show less evolution than our fiducial runs .",
    "figure [ fig : l1prof ] demonstrates that the halo evolution is similar to our fiducial @xmath170 experiment , giving us confidence that the halo evolution we see is unaffected by this centering - driven instability .",
    "figure [ fig : dencut ] compares the projected density profiles of noise - triggered and external quadrupole - driven bars and shows that the initial bar length and strength are nearly independent of the triggering mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , neither bar has surface density profiles that are as flat as those observed in strongly barred galaxies ( kormendy 1982 , elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) ; this is a common problem for bars produced in collisionless n - body simulations ( sparke & sellwood 1987 ) .",
    "however , a more realistic bar would have an even greater impact on the dark halo given its larger quadrupole .",
    "figure [ fig : quadpot ] compares the potential in the @xmath107 component of the disk at @xmath171 ( 1.3 gyr , 2.2 gyr ) , long after the application of the external trigger , to the analytic potential provided by the quadrupole in equation ( [ eq : quadpot ] ) for integer values of @xmath76 between 1 and 5 .",
    "while the form of the potential used to trigger the bar initially is a centrally shallow @xmath80 , the bar quickly evolves into one with a steeper potential .",
    "hence , the bar evolution is independent of the precise form of the triggering potential .",
    "furthermore , this comparison shows that the homogeneous ellipsoid is a reasonable choice to model the quadrupole potential of a self - consistent bar , as we do in papers i and ii .    when we allow the disk to form an approximately scale length - sized bar through noise - driven instabilities , the halo profile is flattened at nearly the same rate and to nearly the same radius as the quadrupole - induced bar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : s5prof ] ) .",
    "this similar behavior from two very different bar - formation mechanisms shows that the response of the halo does not strongly depend on the bar triggering mechanism .      even in state - of - the - art n - body simulations ,",
    "the number of dark - matter particles is still _ many _ orders of magnitude smaller than those found in real galaxies .",
    "the errors introduced when the potential is realized in such a coarse manner can be significant .",
    "this leads to three possible sources of error : there may be an insufficient number of particles to allow the necessary first - order cancellation to take place near the resonance , the poisson noise fluctuations from the discretely realized phase space can overwhelm the resonant potential , and the small - scale noise can scatter orbits so that they diffuse past the resonance , completely obliterating the resonant response . to properly resolve the slow evolution of a galaxy with an n - body experiment ,",
    "it is critical to use enough particles to ensure that resonant orbits both exist in the model and are stable for astrophysically interesting time scales .",
    "naturally , the minimum number of particles needed to accurately track the dynamics depends on both the problem addressed and on the noise characteristics of the n - body code , so it is difficult to provide a universal particle number requirement . with current n - body technology",
    ", however , long - term evolution seems to require at least several million particles to fully resolve low order resonant interactions ( kandrup & sideris 2002 , paper ii ) .    here",
    ", we empirically determine the critical particle number required to minimally resolve the resonant physics important for our problem , and elaborate on the problems faced when too few particles are used .",
    "in addition , we compare the particle number requirements derived here to theoretical criteria derived through perturbation theory analysis and using idealized n - body experiments in paper ii .    to ensure that the 5.5 million particle experiments are accurately resolving the dynamics , we compare both the evolution of 1.1 and 10 million particle simulations , @xmath181 and @xmath182 respectively , to the fiducial 5.5 million particle run .",
    "experiment @xmath182 yields a nearly identical density evolution to that of our fiducial experiment , @xmath170 , implying that 5.5 million particles are sufficient for our numerical technique to resolve the dynamics of the bar  halo interactions responsible for driving cusp evolution .",
    "[ fig : f10prof ] ) .",
    "therefore , we consider the halo evolution observed in our 5.5 million particle simulations to be a robust estimate of true resonant dynamics between a bar and halo .",
    "conversely , the relative lack of density evolution in experiment @xmath181 , as evidenced figure [ fig : f1prof ] , implies that 1 million equal mass particles within the virial radius is not enough to properly resolve the dynamics .",
    "as we demonstrate b elow , the @xmath181 experiment appears to have been plagued both by insufficient particle number at the crucial resonances and by global potential fluctuations .",
    "these both act to severely underestimate the true density evolution of the halo .    as discussed in",
    " 2 , any experiment designed to simulate resonant dynamics must have a well - populated resonance potential .",
    "this is the fundamental criterion , @xmath7 , derived in paper ii .",
    "for example , runs @xmath170 and @xmath182 show that the ilr is the most important resonance for increasing the angular momentum of the inner halo .",
    "the resonance potential for the ilr is global and extends from the center of the halo out to a significant fraction of the bar radius ( see fig . 3 of paper ii ) .",
    "at least a million particles are required to adequately sample the outer part of the resonant ilr potential , while approximately 10 million particles are needed to fully sample the innermost part of the resonance , which is crucial to the flattening of the halo cusp ( paper ii ) . from this consideration alone , it is apparent that 1 million particle simulations will be unable to follow the halo evolution physics correctly .",
    "in fact , even our @xmath182 experiments only minimally sample the entire ilr",
    ". it would be prudent to repeat all of these simulations with 10 times more particles to better sample the inner part of the ilr resonance , though this is beyond our current capabilities .",
    "however , even when the resonance potential is well - sampled , poisson noise from the finite - particle realization of the potential can overwhelm the resonant potential .",
    "an appeal to poisson statistics demands that the @xmath181 run suffers from larger potential fluctuations .",
    "we can see the effect that these potential fluctuations have on the quadrupole component of the disk in figure [ fig : relpower ] , which compares the power in the @xmath183 harmonic for runs @xmath181 and @xmath170 .",
    "the @xmath181 run features far less power in the @xmath107 mode for both the disk and the dark matter halo ( not plotted ) . despite being triggered with the same bar strength",
    ", the the @xmath181 bar fails to grow as strongly as in the @xmath170 simulation .",
    "we believe the excess non - physical noise in the 1 million particle simulation has damped the quadrupole wake in the halo .    using the formalism developed in paper ii , we can compare the power in the noise to the power in potential from our basis expansion .",
    "we find that a simulation that resolves up to @xmath184 radial terms requires approximately 3.5 million particles to prevent poisson noise from overpowering the signal of the resonant response .",
    "this critical number is similar to the signal - to - noise threshold derived in paper ii for 10 radial basis terms .",
    "our use of orthogonal functions to estimate the power at particular scales is no different than any fourier - based power spectrum : the maximum number of radial terms corresponds to smallest spatial scale .",
    "other potential solvers , such as direct summation or tree algorithms , typically resolve many more length scales and consequently have many more degrees of freedom .",
    "our estimate based on @xmath184 radial basis terms will place a lower limit on the particle requirement for these other methods .    using these criteria ,",
    "the reason for the lack of evolution in the @xmath181 experiment is clear : it is impossible for 1 million particles to simulate the resonant dynamics .",
    "the agreement between the simulation results presented here and the predictions of both linear perturbation theory ( lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 , tremaine & weinberg 1984 ) and idealized halo  rigid bar n body simulations ( papers i & ii ) provides us with a firm physical foundation to interpret our results . we have demonstrated",
    "microscopically that resonances mediate the angular momentum transfer and drive the structural evolution , a point recently emphasized by athanassoula ( 2003 ) in studies pertaining to bar growth .",
    "differences with other recent studies may be explained either by differences in the bar shape or by noise effects owing to insufficient particle number as described in  2 and  5.3 , or both .    in these recent studies ,",
    "the halo is represented as an approximation of a smooth system , yet approximately @xmath185 of the mass within a dark matter halo is contained within clumps between @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( moore et al .",
    "1999b , font et al .",
    "this substructure noise spectrum provides large , low frequency fluctuations and weinberg ( 2001ab ) shows that resonance driven evolution does occur in the presence of this real astronomical noise .",
    "in contrast , _",
    "n - body _ discreteness noise generates high spatial frequency fluctuations that drive evolution by local diffusion .",
    "a sufficiently rapid drift in orbital frequencies decouples orbits from any resonances and diminishes or eliminates the torque",
    ". therefore , noise on interparticle scales has very different consequences than large - scale dark matter substructure . although astrophysical noise is most certainly an important contribution to galaxy evolution , astrophysical and numerical noise sources have different effects on the evolution studied here .",
    "astrophysical noise causes the location of resonances to slowly change while numerical noise causes them to disappear .",
    "we have presented two particle number criteria necessary for resonances to be effective ( see paper ii for details ) and have tested them empirically . for equal mass halo particles ,",
    "at least 5 million particles are required within the virial radius to fully resolve the resonant physics .",
    "a third criterion requires a sufficient particle number so that an orbit does not diffuse away from resonances ; we defer development of this to a later paper .",
    "this orbit diffusion criterion is not critical for our scf n - body method , but might prove to be the most restrictive for direct summation , tree or grid based techniques .",
    "spatially adaptive codes such as direct summation , multigrid or tree codes can resolve acceleration from structures on many scales .",
    "this is a great advantage when simulating large - scale structure , but unfortunately also allows noise to appear at all scales . at small scales ,",
    "this noise is dominated by finite particle sampling rather than astronomical structure . in contrast",
    ", our scf expansion method selectively filters the small poisson - dominated scales , reducing the small scale noise by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "even though the small scale noise is reduced , our choice of expansion parameters still allows us to fully resolve the resonances themselves .",
    "any further increase in spatial resolution runs the risk of adding to the numerical noise and removing the resonances .    even though the resonances responsible for slowing the bar occur at large radii and are , therefore , easier to accurately resolve , we suspect that the noise characteristics of many widely - used potential solvers have suppressed the torque in those studies that find little evidence for bar slowing .",
    "the numerical criteria for accurately evolving the cusp are more stringent , both because the resonances responsible for the cusp evolution extend to much smaller radii where there are fewer particles and because the resonance responsible has a much weaker , more shallow potential .",
    "we suspect that many studies that fail to find cusp evolution are not adequately resolving the central resonances .",
    "we show in paper ii that the bar slow down rate and the change in the halo density profile depend sensitively on the shape , amplitude , and size of the bar .",
    "bars with a smaller amplitude take longer to slow , have less effect on the cusp , and are more numerically difficult to evolve correctly due to the shallower resonance potential .",
    "although the size of the bar does not greatly effect the slow down rate , a highly centrally concentrated bar has a larger fraction of the power in the m=0 mode , and with less m=2 power it is less capable of driving cusp evolution .",
    "smaller bars are also more numerically difficult to evolve accurately since the resonances lie at smaller radii .",
    "these numerical and physical effects combine to make simulating the evolution of galaxies with small , weak bars particularly subtle .",
    "for example , vk perform simulations of bars using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) potential solver ( kratzov , klypin & khokhlov 1997 ) , allowing the bar to form through local instabilities and following its evolution .",
    "they find that a bar forms with a radius about equal to that where the rotation curve stops rising , that the bar does not slow appreciably , and that the central dark matter cusp is not removed .",
    "all of their differences with our results can be easily explained by their inability to properly follow the resonant dynamics .",
    "it prevents their bar from secularly growing and it remains small . since resonances mediate the angular momentum exchange between the halo and the bar , the bar will not slow and the cusp will not evolve if the resonances are removed .",
    "their simulation with the largest particle number , @xmath188 particles within the virial radius , satisfies our necessary criteria for populating the resonances in phase space .",
    "this number of particles is also enough to suppress fluctuations on the scale of the resonant potential , though more particles are required due to their higher spatial resolution .",
    "their multimass technique partly but not entirely mitigates the problem by concentrating more particles in the central region , making their particle number equivalent to @xmath189 .",
    "however , this and any mesh - based n - body technique suffers from numerical artifacts that artificially decrease the 2-body relaxation time scale ( gneidin & bertschinger 1996 , dehnen 2001 ) .",
    "the short diffusion time scale may scatter orbits too rapidly for resonant angular momentum coupling to take place . although we can not determine the diffusion time scale in the vk experiments without their initial conditions and code , previous comparisons of the noise characteristics of tree and expansion codes",
    "indicate that about 2 - 4 times more particles are required for a tree code to achieve the same diffusion time scale as an equally - smoothed scf code ( hernquist & ostriker 1992 , barnes 1997 ) , implying that a 20 million particle simulation would be required to achieve stable orbits in the halo for a standard grid based code with our spatial resolution .",
    "vk also have extremely high spatial resolution , which further exacerbates the small scale noise problem and would require even more particles , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "furthermore , the orbit diffusion problem is even more acute in the art code .",
    "adaptive refinement serves to better resolve regions of high density , making this a excellent technique to model the halo cusp .",
    "however , if the mesh used to determine the potential is not adjusted often enough to respond to the changing system , as in the simulations of vk , the particles can experience unnaturally large accelerations across mesh boundaries that are unrelated to the true potential ( jessop et al 1994 , anninos , norman , & clarke 1994 , kravtsov , klypin , & khokhlov 1997 ) .",
    "vk choose to regrid only after many particles enter a grid cell to reduce run time .",
    "particles within a grid cell are free to drift relative to one another until regridding occurs . if particles have drifted close together , when regridding occurs , they will suffer artificially large fermi accelerations that will scatter the orbits and pump energy into the system",
    ". this will greatly increase the orbit diffusion and swamp the resonant bar - halo interactions . hence",
    ", the lack of inner halo evolution and the comparatively smaller overall bar  halo torque reported by vk might be partly caused by their technique .",
    "sellwood ( 2002 ) also studied the formation and evolution of bars that formed through local instabilities using a grid based approach .",
    "he forms a bar that is both weaker and more centrally concentrated than those in our simulations ( e.g. @xmath190 ) .",
    "it slows , but does not affect the central dark matter cusp .",
    "his largest simulations contain 21 million particles , enough to satisfy both of our criteria for properly evolving resonant dynamics but perhaps not enough to sufficiently reduce orbit diffusion .",
    "he also uses different initial conditions than either us or vk .",
    "he uses a hernquist profile instead of an nfw profile and , more importantly , instead of starting with an equilibrium model he grows the disk adiabatically .    to investigate the effect of sellwood s disk growth procedure",
    ", we adiabatically grew an @xmath190 disk in an initially @xmath190 halo ( see table [ tab : barparams ] ) , allowing the bar to form by instability .",
    "the surface density profile of the resulting bar is sharply centrally peaked , shown in figure [ fig : dencut ] , as it also appears to be in figure 6 of sellwood ( 2002 ) .",
    "the self - consistent bar in the sellwood study is unlike both the fiducial bar in our work and observations of most strong bars , which have constant surface density profiles ( kormendy 1982 , elmegreen et al .",
    "such a highly centrally concentrated bar is less capable of driving cusp evolution .",
    "in addition , the bar appears to be much weaker than in @xmath190 .",
    "our adiabatically formed disk is 1.5 times hotter than the one in our equilibrium initial conditions , and sellwood s use of a rather low disk to dark halo mass ratio of 0.05 further raises the q value ; local instability triggered bars in hot disks are smaller and weaker .",
    "since halo evolution scales with the bar mass , we believe the lack of halo evolution is likely a consequence of an anomalously weak quadrupole . finally , since it is more numerically challenging to evolve smaller , weaker bars",
    ", sellwood s simulation might not be able to resolve the inner resonances responsible for the cusp evolution but still be able to resolve those responsible for slowing the bar .",
    "athanassoula ( 2003 ) presents self - consistent n - body simulations of a forming and evolving bar using a direct summation approach implemented with grape .",
    "her bars form through local instabilities and many of her results are consistent with our findings .",
    "most of her bars slow and she shows that angular momentum transfer to the halo , mediated by resonances , determines the slow down rate . although not discussed in the text , her figures 8 and 12 clearly indicate a reduction in the central dark matter density .",
    "her halo profile is an isothermal sphere with a core truncated at about 1/9 the virial radius . in her typical experiment ,",
    "she uses 2 million particles , which would be equivalent to about 10 million particles if she simulated an nfw profile that extended to the virial radius .",
    "in addition , she uses a multimass technique that further increases her effective particle number to at least 25 million .",
    "once again , this is enough particles to satisfy both of our particle number criteria for properly evolving the resonant dynamics but perhaps not enough to sufficiently reduce orbit diffusion in a direct summation code .",
    "however , in her run that best matches our fiducial simulation , mhh2 , the change in the bar pattern speed was about 3.5 times smaller than ours .",
    "this run features a more extended halo , based on set of initial conditions that add a second component with larger extent and a larger core .",
    "she finds that bar slow down rate decreases with increasing halo extent and attributes this trend to a higher velocity dispersion in the more extended halos .",
    "although this could in theory explain her results , athanassoula s experiment does not represent a fixed profile successively truncated at smaller radii .",
    "she increases the extent of her initial halo by adding a component with a larger core radius",
    ". this new profile increases @xmath191 not only in the outer parts but at all radii , which not only changes the velocity dispersion , but also changes the dark - matter gravitational potential and , hence , the orbital frequency distribution near the bar . in paper",
    "ii we perform simulations using our idealized bar model with nfw profiles truncated from @xmath192 to @xmath193 . in all cases ,",
    "the bars slow down at roughly the same rate and the velocity dispersions at the bar radius do not measurably change .",
    "the velocity dispersion only changes significantly near the truncation radius .    moreover , athanassoula s extended halos modify the stability of the disk , i.e. the dispersion relation , by contributing additional gravitational support , thereby modifying the length and shape of the forming bar .",
    "in fact , the bars that formed in her multicomponent halo systems are smaller and weaker than those in the single component halos ( athanassoula 2003 , her fig . 8) .",
    "the shape of the bar s quadrupole critically determines the strength of the coupling with the halo as a function of radius ( see paper ii ) .",
    "this both explains the differing torque estimates and suggests that the trends reported in athanassoula ( 2003 ) may depend sensitively on both the bar shape and halo profile .",
    "in addition , smaller bars require a larger number of particles to adequately resolve the resonances and too few particles could systematically diminish the torque .",
    "bars form through the secular growth of features either triggered by local instabilities or externally , e.g. by satellite encounters .",
    "resonant angular momentum exchange with both the dark halo and the outer disk facilitates this secular growth ( athanassoula 2003 ) .",
    "hence , to accurately simulate bar growth one must properly simulate resonant dynamical processes , requiring the simulation to meet all the numerical criteria discussed above .",
    "the size and strength of bars that form through local instabilities depend on the stability of the disk , i.e. disks with lower toomre q values will form stronger bars than those with larger q values .",
    "since the formation of a local instability triggered bar depends on the existence of an ilr , the initial bar sizes are restricted to the rising part of the rotation curve .",
    "however , secular growth can further increase the bar size well into the flat part of the rotation curve . in the simulations of athanassoula ( 2003 ) ,",
    "bars form through local instabilities that are two to four times larger than the radius where the rotation curve becomes flat .",
    "in contrast , when bars form due to an external trigger , even their initial size is not restricted to the rising part of the rotation curve .",
    "the large imposed quadrupole potential from the tidal trigger overwhelms the `` donkey star '' growth criterion ( lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 ) based on the underlying potential alone .",
    "similarly , a tidal trigger nullifies formation arguments based on swing amplified instabilities ( e.g. mayer & wadsley 2003 ) . to demonstrate this",
    ", we perform a simulation ( @xmath194 ) where we externally trigger and form a large stable bar using our fiducial simulation ( @xmath170 ) parameters , but with a quadrupole scale length that is twice as large . the bar forms with a radius of @xmath195 ( 2.3 kpc , 12 kpc ) after @xmath196 ( 2.0 gyr , 3.3 gyr ) , as shown in figure [ fig : bigbar ] .",
    "remember that the disk had an initial scale length of @xmath197 ( 580 pc , 3 kpc ) and that the rotation became flat at @xmath198 ( 580 pc , 3 kpc ) .",
    "our n - body experiments demonstrate that an initially corotating , scale - length sized bar will generate a core in the density profile that extends out as far as @xmath200 ( 170 pc , 900 pc ) .",
    "current rotation curve decompositions of high surface brightness spirals ( salucci & burkert 2000 ) suggest halo core radii of at least @xmath195 ( 2.3 kpc , 12 kpc ) .",
    "the dynamics of the gas and stellar components may overwhelm the dark matter signal in these systems , however .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) are thought to be dark matter dominated and can , therefore , be used to obtain a cleaner dark matter signal from the rotation curve .",
    "typical halo core radii for low - surface - brightness galaxies range from 0.001 ( 60 pc , 300 pc ) to 0.02 ( 1.2 kpc , 6 kpc ) .",
    "hence scale - length - sized bars , like those studied here , can not produce cores this large in cuspy @xmath199cdm density profiles .    however , the lengths of _ tidally - triggered _ bars can be over 10 times larger than those in our fiducial simulations .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous section , we form a bar four times our fiducial length through an external trigger ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bigbar ] ) . since",
    "linear perturbation theory suggests that the destruction of the halo cusp scales with the size of the perturbing quadrupole ( paper i , paper ii ) , we expect that larger primordial bars will generate proportionately larger cores .",
    "a second possible solution invokes multiple epochs of bar formation and destruction during the hierarchical assembly of the galaxy , which is characterized by relatively quiescent periods punctuated by mergers .",
    "since conservation of phase space density suggests that the merger of two halos with a core also forms a halo with a core , the cores will persist as long as one or more bar phases occur sometime during the hierarchical assembly process .",
    "it is plausible that a new disk equilibrium is established after each merger event and that the quadrupole of the merger remnant will externally trigger a large bar .",
    "minor mergers will also trigger bars without disrupting the disk .",
    "a larger core at the end of each merger - punctuated epoch facilitates the formation of a larger bar and subsequently a larger core .",
    "taken more generally , our bar  halo mechanism predicts an intrinsic dispersion in galaxy properties owing to differences in evolutionary history : the present - day morphology will depend on whether or not a large bar was triggered , whether or not a standard bar is excited by astrophysical noise sources , and the overall merger history .",
    "this dependence can lead to galaxies with varying degrees of cusp flattening and disk scale - length evolution .",
    "since most of the evidence against central dark matter cusps in galaxies concerns low surface brightness dwarfs , one might not expect strong bars to form in such systems and , hence , for the mechanism proposed here not to have much relevance .",
    "however , the same analysis used to indicate the lack of a central dark matter cusp also shows that these low surface brightness galaxies are three or four times more baryon deficient than normal galaxies ( van den bosch & swaters 2001 ) .",
    "if a strong bar forms in a gas rich disk of a dwarf galaxy , much of the gas will lose substantial amounts of angular momentum , be driven towards the center , undergo a strong starburst and , due to the shallow potential well of the dwarf galaxy , much of the gas could be expelled as a supernova - driven wind ( dekel & silk 1986 ) . the work done on",
    "the galaxy during this process will cause further expansion of the core .",
    "the remaining galaxy would be one of low surface brightness , possessing a core in its dark matter distribution .",
    "our bar mechanism , therefore , not only provides a natural explanation for the existence of dark matter cores , but for the existence of low surface brightness dwarfs as well ; those dwarf galaxies that had the strongest bars will have the largest cores and the lowest surface brightness .",
    "furthermore , holley - bockelmann , katz , & weinberg ( 2003 ) show that even low surface galaxies can form bars and remove their dark matter cusps .",
    "regardless of the scenario , we have set a lower limit to the size of the core generated by early bar  halo interactions .",
    "this lower limit already has implications that are astrophysically relevant .",
    "for example , gondolo & silk ( 1999 ) have argued that the cusps of dark matter halos may produce a neutrino signal from particle dark matter annihilation , though this requires that the cusp continues inward to 1 pc .",
    "our experiments show that these neutrino signatures will not exist for any galaxy that has gone through a barred phase , unless a supermassive black hole has subsequently induced a cusp ( ullio et al 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , spiral structure can also couple to the dark - matter halo with the same mechanism .",
    "although spiral arms are weaker than bars , it is likely that modest spiral structure in the inner disk would be capable of affecting cusps at the parsec scale .",
    "bars are ubiquitously produced in galaxy simulations either through local instabilities or tidal interactions ( barnes & hernquist 1992 , noguchi 1996 , steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) .",
    "recent cosmological simulations designed to track the morphological evolution of galaxies predict that the bar phase is a natural byproduct of galaxy evolution ( steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) .",
    "an @xmath201 sb galaxy at @xmath202 should have experienced a large bar by @xmath203 , and this should be observable with ngst . both the higher galaxy gas fraction ( somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) and the higher interaction rate ( le fvre et al 2000 , kolatt et . al .",
    "2000 ) should enhance high redshift bar formation . despite all this theoretical prejudice , the high redshift bar fraction of sb galaxies is claimed to be smaller than the local bar fraction : @xmath204 for @xmath205 versus @xmath127 in the local universe ( van den bergh et al .",
    "2002 , abraham et al .",
    "this might be a selection effect .",
    "for example , the identification of high redshift bars might be hampered by low sensitivity ( van den bergh et al .",
    "moreover , the classification technique used to identify high redshift bars may misclassify bars undergoing strong starbursts ( jogee et al .",
    "2002 ) , a characteristic event for a newly - formed bar in a gas rich environment ( friedli & benz 1993 , sheth et al .",
    "in fact , recent nicmos data have revealed that there is no significant evidence for a decrease in the fraction of barred spirals out to @xmath206 ( sheth et al 2003 ) .",
    "answers to this mystery will help define the epoch of bar formation , constrain the `` duty cycle '' of bars and specify the role of bars in driving galaxy evolution through the mechanisms proposed in this paper .",
    "based on linear perturbation theory and idealized n - body simulations for the evolution of a rotating bar in a cuspy dark - matter halo , weinberg & katz ( 2002 ) predicted that the bar slows as it loses angular momentum to the halo and that the dark matter cusp flattens as it gains angular momentum .",
    "resonant interactions between halo orbits and the orbiting bar perturbation causes this angular momentum transfer . we have performed high - resolution , self - consistent n - body simulations of realistic stellar disks embedded in nfw dark matter halos and have verified each of these predictions .",
    "our overall specific conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "the bar mediates significant angular momentum transfer in the galaxy , driving evolution in the disk and halo .",
    "approximately @xmath127 of the initial bar angular momentum is lost to the halo and outer disk after @xmath207 ( 3.5 gyr , 6 gyr ) .",
    "the inner halo cusp is flattened to @xmath200 ( 170 pc for a dwarf , 900 pc for the milky way ) and the inner disk scale length shrinks by @xmath126 for our @xmath208 ( 870 pc , 4.5 kpc ) bar . during this time , the disk transfers @xmath209 of its initial total angular momentum to the halo through resonant interactions",
    "we empirically demonstrate the need for at least 5 million equal mass particles within the virial radius to correctly represent resonant dynamics using an expansion ( scf ) n - body technique .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , with too few particles , poisson fluctuations in the gravitational potential can overwhelm the resonance potential .",
    "this is particularly important for the innermost ilr - like resonance that drives the cusp evolution .",
    "as the particle number decreases , the resolved portion of this resonant potential lies further out in the halo , and the cusp evolution is suppressed .",
    "second , the resonant torque is an ensemble effect , and therefore requires many particles near the resonance in phase space .",
    "paper ii presents explicit numerical criteria for both conditions that agree with our empirical findings .",
    "these particle number criteria are likely to be lower limits for potential solvers such as direct - summation , grid , or tree codes .",
    "these criteria also ignore the effects of orbit diffusion , which would further increase the required particle number for these methods .",
    "a similarly shaped bar forms after stimulation by an external trigger or through an internal instability .",
    "the gravitational potential of either bar is well - represented by that of a homogeneous ellipsoid .",
    "the shape and amplitude of the bar s quadrupole determines the radial scale over which resonant coupling can occur .",
    "a bar with a more gradual profile , such as that used by hernquist & weinberg ( 1992 ) and by sellwood ( 2003 ) , provides a quadrupole thirty times smaller than that found here and than that used in weinberg & katz ( 2002 ) , explaining the negligible evolution and slow down reported by sellwood ( see paper ii for details ) .",
    "we agree with some aspects of previous simulations of bar formation and evolution .",
    "we attribute the differences to either the use of unrealistic initial conditions or to small - scale numerical noise that artificially removes the dynamically important resonances .",
    "we have shown that a tidal interaction can induce strong bars to form , grow , and persist at many disk scale lengths , well beyond the rising part of the galaxy s rotation curve",
    ". hence , the formation of large bars are compatible with flat rotation curve galaxies .",
    "bars , and other more general excitations , may reshape the halo structure for both high- and low - surface brightness galaxies and may affect a galaxy s morphological history .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of present - day rotation curves as probes of the primordial dark matter halo distribution .",

    "<S> the evolution of a stellar bar transforms not only the galactic disk , but also the host dark matter halo . </S>",
    "<S> we present high resolution , fully self - consistent n - body simulations that clearly demonstrate that dark matter halo central density cusps flatten as the bar torques the halo . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is independent of the bar formation mode and occurs even for rather short bars . </S>",
    "<S> the halo and bar evolution is mediated by resonant interactions between orbits in the halo and the bar pattern speed , as predicted by linear hamiltonian perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the bar lengthens and slows as it loses angular momentum , a process that occurs even in rather warm disks . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the bar and halo response can be critically underestimated for experiments that are unable to resolve the relevant resonant dynamics ; this occurs when the phase space in the resonant region is under sampled or plagued by noise . </S>"
