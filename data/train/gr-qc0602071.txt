    "the purpose of this paper is to study some aspects of the relative motion of free test particles in the gravitational field of a rotating astronomical source .",
    "imagine , for the sake of concreteness , a free mass @xmath2 in orbit about the central source of mass @xmath3 and angular momentum @xmath4 , where @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "let @xmath6 be the proper time along the orbit of mass @xmath2 and @xmath7 be a local orthonormal tetrad system that is parallel transported along this path . here @xmath8 is the four - velocity vector of @xmath2 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , are unit spacelike gyro directions that determine the local spatial frame of @xmath2 .",
    "we employ units such that @xmath11 throughout ; moreover , the signature of the metric is @xmath12 in our convention .",
    "suppose that at @xmath13 a probe is launched from @xmath2 and for some time @xmath14 the motion of the probe is closely monitored by observers comoving with @xmath2 . to study relative motion in an invariant manner within the context of general relativity , the quasi - inertial fermi normal coordinate system @xcite is indispensable as it most closely corresponds to actual observations .",
    "let @xmath15 be the fermi coordinates of the probe at an event @xmath16 , then there exists a unique spacelike geodesic of length @xmath17 that connects @xmath16 orthogonally to the path of @xmath2 at an event @xmath18 with proper time @xmath6 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the unit vector at @xmath18 that is tangent to the spacelike geodesic at @xmath18 and orthogonal to the worldline of @xmath2 .",
    "the metric in fermi coordinates is given by @xmath22 to second order in the distance away from @xmath2 that permanently lies at the spatial origin of the fermi coordinates by construction and has fermi coordinates @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 which is the projection of the riemann curvature tensor on the tetrad frame @xmath26 along the reference worldline .",
    "the theoretical equation of motion of the probe relative to mass @xmath2 can be described by the reduced geodesic equation  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fermi velocity of the probe relative to @xmath2 .",
    "the four - velocity of the probe is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 can be determined from @xmath31 since @xmath32 is a timelike unit vector .",
    "the fermi coordinates are geodesic coordinates based on an orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath33 that is parallel propagated along the orbit of @xmath2 .",
    "they are admissible within a cylindrical region of radius @xmath34 along the worldline of @xmath2 ; that is , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a certain radius of curvature of spacetime .",
    "the nature of @xmath36 has been discussed in detail in our recent paper on explicit fermi coordinates  @xcite .    for the sake of simplicity , we limit our considerations to @xmath37 .",
    "a general feature of the reduced geodesic   is that it contains a critical speed given by @xmath38 , especially in the case of one - dimensional motion .",
    "the notion of critical speed in gravitational motion has been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "we are particularly interested in the role that the critical speed @xmath39 plays in the motion of the probe ; therefore the probe can be launched from @xmath2 at any initial speed @xmath40 , but  for simplicity  we concentrate on its motion only when it is relatively close to the reference particle @xmath2 . to first order in @xmath41",
    "is the generalized jacobi equation  @xcite @xmath42 which describes the timelike motion of the probe when @xmath43 for @xmath44 , we can drop all velocity - dependent terms in equations   and ; then , the inequality in   is satisfied and reduces to the jacobi equation @xmath45    suppose that the worldline of the probe can be determined in the fermi coordinate system on the basis of equations   and  ; then , it is in principle possible to find the representation of this worldline in the background coordinate system using the explicit coordinate transformation between the two systems of coordinates . in practice , however , it is not possible in general to find explicit expressions for fermi coordinates in terms of the background coordinates and therefore one has to resort to approximation schemes ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a general discussion of this problem .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to recognize that once @xmath46 is determined from the generalized jacobi equation ( or the jacobi equation ) , the worldline of the probe is completely characterized .",
    "that is , if in the background coordinate system the worldline of @xmath2 is given by @xmath47 , then the worldline of the probe is @xmath48 , where    @xmath49    and we have replaced the fermi temporal coordinate @xmath50 by @xmath6 in the argument of @xmath51 .",
    "this relation follows from the definition of fermi coordinates and the fact that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , since the ( generalized ) jacobi equation is linear in the distance away from the reference trajectory .",
    "alternatively , @xmath48 may be viewed as a perturbed geodesic orbit . depending upon whether @xmath51 is determined from the jacobi or the generalized jacobi equation , the results of this approach may be interpreted respectively in terms of the linear or nonlinear perturbations of geodesic orbits in the background gravitational field .    regarding the source of the gravitational field and the reference trajectory , we assume that @xmath2 is on a stable equatorial circular geodesic orbit about a kerr source .",
    "this choice for the orbit to some extent complements our previous work on the motion of astrophysical jets  @xcite , where the reference trajectory is a radial geodesic along the rotation axis of a kerr source .",
    "the geodesics of kerr spacetime have been discussed by a number of authors ; see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the characteristics of the source and the reference trajectory will be described in detail in the next section .",
    "various aspects of tidal dynamics in black - hole spacetimes have been discussed in a number of papers ; see , for instance  @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "furthermore , we treat free - particle orbits for the sake of simplicity ; a corresponding discussion of black - hole accretion disks  @xcite is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "section  [ s3 ] is devoted to the solution of the jacobi equation .",
    "we show in section  [ s4 ] that a rotation introduced in section  [ s3 ] leads to a complete transformation of the generalized jacobi equation to an autonomous form . this equation",
    "is then analyzed in detail .",
    "finally , section  [ s5 ] contains a brief discussion of our results .",
    "the spacetime region of interest is the exterior kerr domain with the metric @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the specific angular momentum of the source .",
    "here @xmath56 are the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates and @xmath57 the reference trajectory is assumed to be a stable circular orbit of fixed radius @xmath58 in the equatorial plane @xmath59 ; in terms of @xmath58 , such orbits exist from infinity all the way down to the last stable circular orbits given by @xmath60 throughout this paper , the upper ( lower ) sign refers to orbits where @xmath2 rotates in the same ( opposite ) sense as the source . for @xmath58 less than the solution of",
    ", there are unstable circular orbits that end at the null circular orbits given by @xmath61    it is useful to define the keplerian frequency for the orbits under consideration here as @xmath62 let us note that in the orbital equations and , a prograde orbit becomes retrograde and vice versa when @xmath63 ; this circumstance explains why the combination @xmath64 usually appears in orbital equations .",
    "we assume that @xmath65 throughout ; therefore , the sign of @xmath66 indicates the sense of the orbit .",
    "it follows from the geodesic equation that along the reference worldline @xmath67 where @xmath68 is such that the null circular orbits are solutions of @xmath69 and we have assumed in that @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "the constants of the motion for the reference worldline are the specific energy @xmath72 and orbital angular momentum @xmath73 , associated respectively with the timelike and azimuthal killing vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and are given by @xmath76    to determine the orthonormal tetrad @xmath77 , let us first consider the tetrad @xmath78 carried by the fundamental static observers in the exterior kerr spacetime . in the equatorial plane and in terms of @xmath79 , the natural orthonormal tetrad of these observers along the coordinate directions is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 next , we subject this tetrad to a lorentz boost with speed @xmath82 , @xmath83 , such that @xmath84 is the unit vector tangent to the worldline of the reference particle @xmath2 .",
    "the new orthonormal tetrad along the orbit of @xmath2 is @xmath85 , \\quad   \\tilde{\\lambda}^\\mu _ { ( 1 ) } = \\lambda^\\mu _ { \\hspace{\\myspace } ( 1)},\\\\ \\label{eq19}\\tilde{\\lambda}^\\mu_{\\hspace{\\myspace}(2 ) } = \\lambda^\\mu _ { \\hspace{\\myspace}(2 ) } , \\quad \\tilde{\\lambda}^\\mu_{\\hspace{\\myspace } ( 3 ) } = \\tilde{\\gamma } [ \\lambda^\\mu_{\\hspace{\\myspace } ( 3 ) } + \\tilde{\\beta } \\lambda^\\mu_{\\hspace{\\myspace}(0 ) } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the lorentz factor corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "we find from @xmath87 that the lorentz pair @xmath88 is given by @xmath89    clearly , @xmath90 is positive ( negative ) for prograde ( retrograde ) orbits ; moreover , @xmath91 diverges at the null orbits ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the spatial triad of @xmath92 is along the spherical polar coordinate directions , which are the radial , normal and tangential directions with respect to the orbit , and therefore needs to be rotated back such that the resulting tetrad would then be parallel propagated along the orbit as illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "thus @xmath93 it follows from the vanishing of the covariant derivative of @xmath94 along the orbit that @xmath95 where we have chosen the integration constant such that @xmath96 at @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath97 , which , to first order in @xmath98 and @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 that is , the difference between these angles is due to a combination of geodetic and gravitomagnetic precessions . the final result for the tetrad frame in @xmath101 coordinates is then @xmath102    finally , we need to compute the projection of the riemann tensor along the orbit on this tetrad frame as in equation  .",
    "the result may be expressed as a @xmath103 matrix @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are indices that belong to the set @xmath107 .",

    "let us note that for the orbits under consideration and @xmath125 , @xmath126 $ ] ; that is , @xmath127 is positive ( negative ) for a prograde ( retrograde ) orbit and far from the source ( @xmath128 ) , @xmath129 , so that @xmath130 as @xmath131 , then @xmath132 monotonically increases from zero to @xmath133 at the last stable circular orbits .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath134 , @xmath127 is always negative for retrograde orbits , but it is not always positive for prograde orbits ; in fact , @xmath127 vanishes for a prograde orbit with radius @xmath135 .",
    "these curvature components can now be used in equations and to study the motion of the probe relative to @xmath2 .",
    "it should be mentioned that our results for the tidal tensor @xmath109 are consistent with the work of marck  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the solution of the jacobi equation  . for simplicity , we use instead of the fermi coordinates @xmath136 , the _ dimensionless _ fermi coordinates @xmath137 , @xmath138 where @xmath139 .",
    "the jacobi equation then takes the form    @xmath140 = s \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x\\\\ z\\end{array}\\right ] , \\qquad s=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 3\\gamma^2 \\cos ^2\\eta-1 & 3\\gamma^2 \\sin \\eta \\cos \\eta \\\\",

    "we note that @xmath155 , since @xmath156 so that for @xmath125 , @xmath157 ranges from zero to unity ; that is , it decreases monotonically from unity at @xmath144 to zero at the last stable circular orbits .",

    "it is interesting to note that terms that appear in the solution of the jacobi equation in equations   and   with proper frequency @xmath164 have frequency @xmath165 with respect to the coordinate time @xmath166 ; to lowest order in @xmath167 and with @xmath168 , the deviation of this frequency from the keplerian frequency corresponds to the einstein precession frequency for an orbit of vanishing eccentricity , while the first - order correction in @xmath169 corresponds to the de sitter - lense - thirring precession frequency  @xcite .",
    "finally , a remark is in order here regarding the boundary condition that @xmath170 at @xmath171 , which corresponds to our assumption that the probe is initially launched from @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , it is only necessary that the probe be near the reference particle @xmath2 , so that @xmath41 must be initially very small compared to @xmath34 ; for the sake of simplicity , we choose @xmath172 throughout this paper .",
    "this means that in terms of @xmath173 , we always assume that @xmath174",
    "the reduction of the jacobi equation to the autonomous system is basically due to the fact that @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is a constant matrix . system then takes the form @xmath177 = d\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\xi\\\\ \\zeta \\end{array}\\right ] , \\ ] ] which is equivalent to system .",
    "the transformation from @xmath178 to @xmath179 involves a rotation from a local inertial frame to rotating axes ; therefore , in equation   we note the presence of coriolis and centripetal terms on the left - hand side of this system .",
    "moreover , this transformation is related to hill s contributions to the classical three - body problem @xcite ; indeed , system in the newtonian limit @xmath180 is equivalent to a limiting form of the hill system discussed in ref .",

    "@xcite with @xmath181 .",
    "it can be shown , after much algebra , that under the same rotation as in equation , the nonlinear generalized jacobi equation can be rendered autonomous as well .",

    "however , the results of such a perturbation scheme , based on the small parameter @xmath189 , should be used only in conjunction with the higher - order tidal terms  that is , terms that have been neglected in the expansions of the gravitational potentials in equations   and would result in terms in the equation of motion   that go beyond the linear order in @xmath41 .",
    "it follows from equations  ,  , and   that the trajectory of the probe in boyer - lindquist coordinates , @xmath190 , is given by @xmath191 using @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 from the ( generalized ) jacobi equation and replacing @xmath195 by @xmath196 , we can determine the path of the probe in the standard kerr coordinate system .",
    "this is due to the fact that the generalized jacobi equation is linear in the distance @xmath197 away from the reference geodesic ; therefore , @xmath198 may be viewed as a generalized jacobi field that is defined along the reference geodesic .",
    "it turns out that for small - amplitude perturbations @xmath199 ) , the radial ( @xmath200 ) and vertical ( @xmath159 ) motions in general contain the basic proper epicyclic frequencies @xmath201 and @xmath202 , respectively .",
    "the autonomous system of equations  naturally splits into equations for the vertical and equatorial motions .",
    "that is , if the probe is launched vertically in the @xmath159 direction , then its motion will be confined to the @xmath159 direction according to the generalized jacobi equation .",
    "similarly , if the probe is launched in the orbital @xmath203 plane , then the probe will remain in this plane throughout its motion .",
    "if the probe is launched in the purely vertical direction relative to the reference orbit , then @xmath204 for all @xmath147 and hence the equations of motion reduce to @xmath205 the vertical motion is simply uniform for @xmath206 ; that is , equation   exhibits the critical speed @xmath207 beyond which the character of the motion is opposite to the low - speed limit that agrees with newtonian expectations .",
    "if the probe is launched with @xmath208 , then it will begin to decelerate in agreement with newtonian gravity .",
    "however , for @xmath209 , the probe will accelerate , as treated in detail in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the vertical motion can be described exactly  @xcite , since equation   implies that @xmath210 whose solution can be determined by quadrature .",
    "this solution represents timelike geodesic motion if the following condition is satisfied @xmath211 for @xmath212 , condition   is always satisfied and it follows from   that the motion of @xmath159 is periodic and confined to the interval @xmath213 $ ] , where @xmath214 on the other hand , for @xmath215 the particle is accelerated to ( almost ) the local speed of light . in this way",
    ", the particle gains enormous tidal energy . according to condition",
    ", the range of @xmath159 over which this happens monotonically shrinks to zero as @xmath189 approaches unity .",
    "the question of the admissibility of fermi coordinates in such a case is a difficult one ; an unsuccessful attempt to answer such a question is contained in our recent work  @xcite .",
    "it is essential  for astrophysical applications  to connect these local results to what distant observers would measure  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the gravitational tidal energy of particles within the fermi coordinate system can be transferred to the outside world ( i.e. beyond the fermi system ) through collisions with other particles or emission of radiation .    in our previous work involving tidal dynamics",
    "about a reference escape trajectory along the axis of rotation of the central source  @xcite , we found that for relative speeds above the critical speed @xmath216 , tidal _ deceleration _ occurs in a cone of angle @xmath217 measured from the rotation axis , where @xmath217 is given by @xmath218 and corresponds to an angle of about @xmath219 , while tidal _ acceleration _ occurs outside this cone , i.e. within the complement of the critical - velocity cone involving latitudes from @xmath220 to @xmath221 , where @xmath222 and corresponds to an angle of about @xmath223 .",
    "based on these previous results , we expect that in the present situation the phenomenon of tidal acceleration for speeds above the critical speed may not be restricted to the vertical axis alone . to investigate this issue in the case under consideration , we have integrated the full system of equations   with initial conditions  .",
    "our results indicate that vertical acceleration  either parallel or antiparallel to the kerr rotation axis ",
    "occurs when the probe is launched with @xmath224 in a direction @xmath225 , where for a given @xmath226 , @xmath227 is restricted to a certain interval , namely , @xmath228 .",
    "to clarify the situation analytically , let us first note that if @xmath229 is a solution of equations  ",
    ", then so is @xmath230 .",
    "in particular , equation   is clearly invariant under the parity transformation @xmath231 ; therefore , vertical motion is expected to occur symmetrically with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "for this reason , we limit our considerations to @xmath232 , which corresponds to motion antiparallel to the kerr axis in our convention ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , let us note that with initial conditions  , vertical acceleration vanishes initially , i.e. @xmath233 at @xmath234 ; therefore , it proves useful to compute @xmath235 using equation  .",
    "it turns out that @xmath236 where @xmath237 is a quadratic function of @xmath238 given by @xmath239 here @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 are defined by @xmath243 for @xmath244 , @xmath235 is positive for @xmath224 ; in fact , this is the case for an extended domain about the kerr axis .",
    "the boundary of this domain is characterized by @xmath245 , i.e. @xmath246 given by @xmath247 and @xmath248 ( i.e. @xmath249 ) , where @xmath235 vanishes , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:1.5 ] , where @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "let us recall that for a prograde reference orbit of radius @xmath58 about a kerr black hole , @xmath127 increases monotonically from zero at @xmath252 to @xmath253 at the last stable circular orbit . for a fixed @xmath254",
    "$ ] and @xmath209 , the tidal - acceleration domain expands as @xmath255 . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath256 ,",
    "the acceleration domain in figure  [ fig:1.5 ] remains practically the same as @xmath257 .",
    "for @xmath130 , however , the shape of the domain changes significantly .",
    "in fact , for @xmath258 , it follows from equation   that @xmath259 , where @xmath260 defined by @xmath261 is a positive constant such that @xmath262 .",
    "therefore , the acceleration domain in this case is within the intersection of the vertical strip defined by @xmath263 , where @xmath264 and @xmath265 , and the circle of unit radius centered at the origin of @xmath266 coordinates .",
    "though we have considered a simple circular equatorial orbit as the reference trajectory in this paper , it is not difficult to imagine that the tidal acceleration process described above  within the context of the physics of an accretion disk about the source  could possibly contribute to the formation of astrophysical jets .",
    "moreover , tidal acceleration occurs symmetrically with respect to the equatorial plane of the kerr source .",
    "this feature would be consistent with the observed occurrence of double jets , namely , a pair of relativistic outflows in opposite directions along the rotation axis of the central source .",
    "if @xmath267 for all @xmath147 , then the motion is confined to the @xmath268 plane and represents a timelike geodesic if @xmath269 a solution of the generalized jacobi equation ( gje ) in the @xmath270 plane is characterized by the parameters @xmath127 , @xmath189 and @xmath271 . for @xmath189 extremely small",
    "compared to unity , the solution of the gje is given essentially by the corresponding solution of the jacobi equation as in the previous section .",
    "in general , as @xmath189 slowly increases toward unity , the influence of the nonlinear terms in the gje can not be ignored .",
    "in fact , since @xmath272 in the jacobi case contains a secular term , namely , @xmath273 with @xmath274 , the solution of the gje in general grows rapidly and leaves the admissible region of the fermi coordinate system .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided , however , in the case of the purely radial variations with @xmath275 or @xmath276 ; in either case , the jacobi equation has periodic solutions corresponding to the stability of the circular reference orbit under small radial perturbations .",
    "the solution of the gje may then contain quasi - periodic oscillations exhibiting a complex beat phenomenon involving several frequencies as demonstrated in figure  [ fig:2 ] . however , such oscillations appear to occur only for @xmath277 , in which case equations   are generally not adequate physically , since higher - order tidal terms of comparable magnitude have been neglected in our analysis",
    ". even if a quasi - periodic oscillation of the type illustrated in figure  [ fig:2 ] survives the inclusion of relevant higher - order tidal terms , the amplitude of the effect may not be large enough to be of any physical significance in connection with the observed quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos )  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the generalized jacobi equation for a circular reference geodesic orbit in the equatorial plane of the exterior kerr spacetime .",
    "this equation has been reduced to an autonomous system ; the corresponding tidal dynamics can then be naturally divided into vertical and equatorial motions relative to the circular orbit . in connection with vertical motion ,",
    "we have clarified the role of the critical speed @xmath207 in the character of the solutions of the generalized jacobi equation .",
    "the general approach developed in this work may be of interest in connection with relativistic physics inside a space station , the tracking of artificial earth satellites as well as satellite - to - satellite doppler tracking .",
    "moreover , in connection with the relativistic astrophysics of accretion disks around ( rotating ) astronomical sources , our results may be relevant for the gravitational aspects of the complex plasma physics that would be involved in the formation of high - energy jets  @xcite .",
    "that is , the vertical acceleration phenomenon explored in this work may be related to how relativistic jets get started above and below an accretion disk around a kerr black hole .",
    "once the flows are magnetically confined to regions near the axis of rotation of the central source , the results of previous investigations  @xcite involving tidal dynamics of ultrarelativistic particles would have to be taken into account for the parallel and antiparallel flows along the kerr rotation axis .",
