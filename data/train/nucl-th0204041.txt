    "recently , information on the excited states of light unstable nuclei has increased rapidly @xcite . in the excited states of",
    "light unstable nuclei , an exotic molecular structure of light unstable nuclei is one of the attractive subjects in experimental and theoretical research .",
    "for example , molecular structure has been suggested to appear in neutron - rich nuclei , such as @xmath4be and @xmath5be @xcite .",
    "w. von oertzen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a kind of exotic clustering structure with a @xmath6 configuration in the excited states of @xmath0be .",
    "however , there have been few microscopic studies on the excited states of @xmath0be .",
    "needless to say , @xmath3-cluster cores are very important in the ground and excited states of @xmath0be as well as in @xmath7be and @xmath4be .",
    "however , we should not forget the breaking of @xmath3-clusters in @xmath0be because there are many valence neutrons around the @xmath3-clusters .",
    "the experimental data concerning the @xmath8-decay strength are very useful to estimate the breaking of the 2@xmath3 clustering structure in be isotopes , because gamow - teller transitions from li to be are not allowed if the @xmath3-cluster cores in the daughter state of be are completely ideal ones with a simple @xmath9 configuration .",
    "it is very interesting that the recently measured @xmath8-decay strength from @xmath0li to @xmath0be indicates significant breaking of @xmath3-clusters in the excited states of @xmath0be @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to also study the breaking of @xmath3-clusters due to the surrounding neutrons as well as the development of clustering in @xmath0be .",
    "we should point out another interesting feature in @xmath0be .",
    "abnormal parity of the ground state in @xmath0be has been known for a long time .",
    "namely , the spin parity of the ground state is @xmath10 , which seems to be inconsistent with the ordinary shell - model picture in which @xmath0be with 7 neutrons may have a @xmath11 state as the ground state .",
    "it has long been a problem why parity inversion occurs in @xmath0be . as possible reasons for this parity inversion , such effects as the halo structure ,",
    "a core deformation , clustering and paring are suggested .",
    "for example , the energy gain of a positive parity state of @xmath0be is discussed in refs @xcite .",
    "however , the ground - state structure has not been sufficiently studied by fully microscopic calculations without such assumptions as the existence of core nuclei .",
    "although the clustering structure must be important in be isotopes , it is difficult for mean - field approaches to describe developed clustering structures . with a theoretical method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics , dot et al .",
    "have studied the abnormal parity ground state of @xmath0be without assuming cores or the stability of the mean field . however , in their work@xcite , the effects of angular - momentum projections and three - body forces were approximately estimated by perturbative treatments .    our aim is to make a systematic research on the structure of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be based on the microscopic calculations .",
    "an important point is that the theoretical approach should be free from such model assumptions as stability of the mean field , and the existence of inert cores or clusters .",
    "first of all , traditional mean - field approaches are not useful to study the developed clustering structure in be isotopes . with cluster models , the clustering structure of the excited states of @xmath7be and @xmath4be has been successfully explained @xcite by assuming 2-@xmath3 cores and surrounding neutrons . since the assumption of 2 @xmath3-cluster cores is not appropriate to discuss the breaking of @xmath3-cores , these cluster models are not sufficient for investigations of @xmath0be with many valence neutrons . in fact , it is difficult to use them to directly calculate the experimental data of the @xmath8-decay strength from @xmath0li . with these models it may not be possible to describe the recently discovered excited state at 8.04 mev with the strong @xmath8 transition strength from @xmath0li .",
    "we have applied a theoretical approach of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) .",
    "the amd method has already proved to be useful for studying the structures of light nuclei @xcite . within this framework",
    ", we do not need such model assumptions as inert cores , clusters , nor axial symmetries , because the basis wave functions of a nuclear system are written by slater determinants where all centers of the gaussian - type spatial part of single - particle wave functions are free parameters . in amd studies of neutron - rich nuclei , we investigated the structures of be isotopes @xcite . in amd calculations ,",
    "many kinds of experimental data for nuclear structure have been reproduced . due to the flexibility of the amd wave function , we have succeeded to describe the structure changes between shell - model - like states and clustering states with an increase in the neutron number . in previous studies @xcite on",
    "be isotopes , the excited states of @xmath0be were not studied in detail because the calculations are based on the variation before a total - angular - momentum projection .",
    "recently , the amd framework has been developed to be an extended version based on variational calculations after a spin - parity projection(vap ) , which has already been confirmed to be powerful for studying the excited states of light nuclei .",
    "the method has been applied to a stable nucleus @xmath5c @xcite , and to unstable nuclei : @xmath4be , @xmath5be and @xmath12be@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be were studied by performing vap calculations using the amd method . in the next section ( sec .",

    "@xmath19 is the intrinsic spin function parameterized by @xmath24 , while @xmath20 is the isospin function which is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) in the present calculations .",

    "@xmath26 are the centers of gaussians for spatial parts and the parameters @xmath24 s determine the directions of intrinsic spins of the single particle wave functions .",
    "if we consider a parity eigenstate projected from an amd wave function , the total wave function consists of two slater determinants , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a parity projection operator . in the case of a total - angular - momentum projection(@xmath29-projection ) , the wave function of a system is represented by the integral of the rotated states , @xmath30 where the function @xmath31 is the well - known wigner s d function and @xmath32 stands for the rotation operator with euler angle @xmath33 .    in principal the total wave function",

    ", we start vap calculations for the normalized energy expectation value @xmath58 with the adopted @xmath55 quantum from the initial state . in general",
    ", the direction of the approximately principal @xmath54-axis is automatically determined in the energy variation because the shape of the intrinsic system can vary freely .",
    "the approximately principal axis can deviate from the @xmath53-axis in the vap procedure with a given @xmath57 .",
    "that is to say that the optimum state @xmath34 obtained after the variation may contain so - called @xmath59-mixing ( @xmath60 ) components .",
    "however , the deviation of @xmath54-axis from the @xmath53-axis is found to be small in many cases .",
    "it means that the obtained states do not contain @xmath59-mixing components so much , and @xmath55 well corresponds to the @xmath59 quantum .    concerning the states in the lowest band with each parity , we can obtain appropriate initial wave functions by simple vbp calculations as mentioned above .",
    "for the highly excited states , in order to obtain initial wave functions and appropriate @xmath55 quanta for vap calculations we make vbp calculations with a constraint on amd wave function .",

    "the structures of the excited states of @xmath0be are studied based on the vap calculations in the framework of amd . in this section",
    "we present the theoretical results concerning the energy levels , the @xmath13 transitions , and the @xmath8 transitions , which should be directly compared with the experimental data .",
    "more detailed discussions of the intrinsic structures are given in the next section .",
    "we adopt two sets of the interaction parameters .",
    "one parameter set ( 1 ) is @xmath77 , @xmath78 for majorana , bartlett and heisenberg terms in the central force and @xmath79 mev for the strength of the spin - orbit forces , which have been used in the previous study on the excited states of @xmath4be .",
    "we also try another set ( 2 ) with weaker spin - orbit forces as @xmath80 mev .",

    "we make vap calculations for the spin - parity projected amd wave function with the fixed intrinsic spin directions as 3 spin - down protons , one spin - up proton , 4 spin - down and 4 spin - up neutrons .",
    "the obtained wave function for the @xmath89 state is dominated by a component of total - intrinsic spin @xmath110 for protons .",
    "we superpose the wave functions to calculate the final wave functions by diagonalizing hamiltonian and norm matrixes simultaneously .",
    "we should notice that all possible excited states are not exhausted in the present calculations .",
    "in this work we perform vap calculations basically for the rotational states which can be known from vbp calculations with or without constraint .",
    "for the higher excited states we must extend the vap calculations with orthogonal condition to the lower states by superpositions as the previous studies @xcite . above the states shown in the present results , there should exist other excited states which may be obtained with the extended vap calculations .",
    "the theoretical binding energies of @xmath0be are 58.2 mev in the case ( 1 ) and 54.4 mev in the case ( 2 ) , both of which underestimate the experimental value 65.48 mev",
    ". the binding energy can be reproduced by choosing a interaction parameter such as @xmath111 of the majorana term .",
    "however unfortunately it is difficult to reproduce all the features of nuclear structures such as binding energies , energy levels , radii , deformations and so on with one set of interaction parameters . since we study the excited states taking care about the excitation energies and the intrinsic structures , we adopt the case(1 ) interaction which reproduces well the features of the excited states of @xmath4be@xcite except for the binding energy .",
    "with this interaction the spin - parity @xmath10 of the ground state of @xmath0be can be described in the present calculations .",
    "we also use another interaction case ( 2 ) with the weaker spin - orbit forces to be compared .",
    "the improvement of effective interactions is one of the important problems in nuclear studies .",
    "here we comment on the stability of amd wave functions above threshold energies .",
    "since the single particle wave functions are written by gaussians in amd calculations , the relative motion between particles in a system is restricted by a gaussian or a linear combination of gaussians . because of the limitation of the model space , continuum states nor out going waves can not be represented in the present model . even if the energy of a nucleus is above the threshold energies of particle decays , the particles can not necessarily go away in the present framework . in this sense ,",
    "the system is treated in the bound state approximation .",
    "the widths for the particle decays should be discussed carefully by other frameworks such as the method with reduced width amplitude or the complex scaling method beyond the present amd framework .",
    "= 0.4    = 0.45    the energy levels of @xmath0be are shown in fig.[fig : be11spe ] .",
    "there are many low - lying levels in the experimental data .",
    "the abnormal spin parity @xmath10 of the ground state has been known , although the normal spin parity of @xmath0be is @xmath11 in the simple shell - model picture . the calculations with the case(1 )",
    "interaction reproduce the parity inversion between @xmath10 and @xmath11 states . in the theoretical results , the rotational bands @xmath83 and @xmath88 start from the band head @xmath10 and @xmath11 states , respectively .",
    "also in the results with the case(2 ) interaction , the @xmath10 state is lowest in the @xmath83 band , however , it is slightly higher than the negative parity @xmath11 state by 1.4 mev . as a result",
    ", the abnormal parity of the ground state can not be reproduced by the case ( 2 ) interaction which the spin - orbit forces are weaker than those in the case ( 1 ) .",
    "we should not conclude the calculations with the case(1 ) interaction are better than those in the case ( 2 ) , because the neutron halo effect on the energy gain of @xmath10 state is not taken into account in the present calculations .",
    "the details of the reproduction of parity inversion with the case(1 ) interaction are described in the later section .    in both results in the case ( 1 ) and the case ( 2 ) , there exist some rotational bands in the low energy region . by classifying the calculated excited states we can obtain three rotational bands @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 which are dominated by @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath6 neutron configurations , respectively . in fig.[fig : be11rot ]",
    ", we show the excitation energies of the rotational bands as a function of total spin @xmath117 .",
    "we find a new eccentric band @xmath114 which starts from the second @xmath89 state at about 4 mev .",
    "the excited states in the @xmath114 band are dominated by @xmath6 excited configurations with 2 particles and 3 holes in neutron shells .",
    "the @xmath114 band is constructed by a well - deformed intrinsic state with a developed clustering structure .",
    "the rotational band indicates large moment of inertia and it reaches the high spin states about 20 mev .",
    "the highest spin is @xmath118 in the case ( 1 ) and @xmath119 in the case ( 2 ) . in vap calculations with further high spins",
    ", we can not obtain any stable states since an @xmath3 particle escapes far away in the variational calculations .",
    "it means that the energy of the relative motion between clusters is beyond the classical barrier due to the coulomb and centrifugal forces .",
    "since the barrier hight is very sensitive to the binding energy , we examine the highest spin of the @xmath114 band with another set of the interaction parameters taking care of the binding energy of @xmath0be .",
    "if we change the majorana exchange term of case ( 1 ) to @xmath111 , we can make the system bound as deeply as the experimental binding energy .",
    "then a @xmath120 state is obtained as the highest spin state .",
    "w. von oertzen et al . suggested some candidates for the states belonging to this new negative parity band in the experimental data observed in the 2 neutron transfer reactions , @xmath7be(@xmath121c , @xmath0c)@xmath0be @xcite .",
    "although they suggested a possibility of @xmath122 state , the present results are negative to such a high spin state as @xmath122 in the rotational @xmath114 band , because @xmath120 is the highest spin made from the @xmath123-@xmath124 configurations .",
    "it should be noticed that the present work is the first microscopic calculation which predicts the @xmath106 band with the well - developed clustering structure . since @xmath0be is a loosely bound system , further studies taking account of widths of the excited states are necessary to determine the band terminal .",
    "we find a excited @xmath89 state at about 10 mev ( fig [ fig : be11spe ] ) . in this state ,",
    "the proton structure is quite strange comparing with the other excited states of @xmath0be . in most of the states of @xmath0be",
    ", we find @xmath1 cores as well as other be isotopes : @xmath125be , @xmath7be and @xmath4be .",
    "however , in the @xmath89 state at 10 mev , only one @xmath3-cluster is formed .",
    "the other 2 protons do not form a @xmath3-cluster but couple to be totally @xmath126 with aligned intrinsic spins .",
    "it is analogue with the structure of the first @xmath127 state with the unnatural spin parity in @xmath5c .",
    "we consider that this @xmath89 state must be the newly measured state at 8.04 mev @xcite to which the @xmath8-decay transition from @xmath0li is strong .",
    "although its excitation energy is overestimated in the present calculations , it is easily improved by changing parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 of the bartlett and heisenberg terms .",
    "for example the parameters @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 gives 2 mev lower excitation energy of the @xmath89 state than the one with @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath77 .",
    "here we fit the majorana parameter @xmath64 as to give the same @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction as the case ( 1 ) .",
    "the change of parameters gives no significant effect on the excitation energies of the other states with 2-@xmath3 clusters .",
    "the results indicate that the bartlett and heisenberg terms should be taken into consideration in the detailed study of the energy levels though they have been often omitted in the traditional works on stable nuclei .",
    "data concerning the @xmath8-decay strength are very useful to investigate structures of excited states .",
    "there are many experimental data concerning the @xmath135 and @xmath136 decays into the excited states of @xmath0be .",
    "the strength of the @xmath135 decays from @xmath0li has been measured recently @xcite . for",
    "the @xmath136 decays , the strength of gamov - teller(gt ) transitions has been deduced from the charge exchange reactions @xmath0b@xmath137he)@xmath0be @xcite . in the gt transitions from @xmath0li@xmath138 and @xmath0b@xmath138 , the allowed daughter states are @xmath11 , @xmath89 or @xmath90 states . in table",
    "[ tab : be11beta ] the experimental log@xmath139 values are presented comparing with the theoretical results . in order to calculate the log(@xmath140 ) values of gt transistions into the excited states of @xmath0be we prepare the parent states @xmath0li@xmath138 and @xmath0b@xmath138 by vap calculations in the same framework .",
    "the experimental log(@xmath140 ) values are reproduced well by the theoretical calculations .",
    "it is easily understood that the decays into the excited states in @xmath114 band are weak because these states have the ell - developed clustering structures with dominated @xmath6 components which make the overlap of a gt operator with the parent state of @xmath0b to be small .",
    "on the other hands , we consider that three levels at 0.32 mev , 2.69 mev and 3.96 mev measured in the @xmath136 transitions correspond to the states @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 in the @xmath113 band because the experimental data indicate the significant @xmath136 strength as log@xmath139 @xmath144 5.0 , which consistent with the theoretical results .",
    "what is important in the @xmath135 decays from @xmath0li is that the strength is very sensitive to the breaking of 2 @xmath3-cluster cores in @xmath0be .",
    "if the daughter state of @xmath0be poses 2 ideal @xmath3-cluster cores with @xmath9 configurations , the gt transitions from @xmath0li are forbidden completely because of pauli principle . in another word ,",
    "the strength of gt transitions from @xmath0li indicates the degree of the @xmath3-cluster breaking in the daughter states of @xmath0be . from this point of view ,",
    "one of the reasons for the weak @xmath135 transitions as log@xmath139=5.67 to the lowest @xmath11 state at 0.32 mev is the 2@xmath3-cluster structure in @xmath0be(@xmath11 ) .",
    "another reason for the weak @xmath135 transitions has been suggested to be the effect of the halo structure in @xmath0li by t. suzuki et al . @xcite .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0li is known to have the neutron halo structure which originates from @xmath145-orbits .",
    "the mixing of the @xmath145-orbits causes weak @xmath135 transitions to the normal states of @xmath0be . since the halo structure of @xmath0li",
    "can not described in the present amd wave function , the possible halo effects on the @xmath135 decays are not included in the present results .",
    "if we suppose the mixing ratio of @xmath145-orbits in the ground @xmath0li state as to be 50 % , the theoretical log@xmath139 values concerning the @xmath135 decays into @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 is expected to be increased by log(2)@xmath146 due to the mixing . even if we add 0.3 of the halo effect by hands to the present log(@xmath140 ) values for @xmath142 and @xmath143 states , the log(@xmath140 ) values in case(1 )",
    "are still smaller than 5.0 , because of the sufficient cluster breaking .",
    "they are consistent with the experimentally measured rather small log@xmath140 values for the decays to @xmath0be(2.7 mev ) and @xmath0be(3.9 mev ) . in another word ,",
    "the experimental data indicates the significant breaking of 2 @xmath3-cluster cores in these states(2.7mev and 3.9mev ) which we consider as the excited states @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    ".    in the recent experiments of the measurements of @xmath135 decays , a new excited state at 8.04 mev with strong @xmath135 transitions has been discovered .",
    "the calculated log@xmath139 values for the @xmath89 state of @xmath0be at about 10 mev well corresponds to this newly observed state at 8.04 mev .",
    "the transition is strong because the 2@xmath3-cluster structure disappears completely in this state .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : be11beta ] , the experimental data concerning the strength of @xmath135 decays have been systematically reproduced in the present calculations .",
    "considering the increases of log@xmath140 due to the halo effect of @xmath0li , the theoretical values of log@xmath140 for @xmath135 calculated with the case ( 1 ) interaction well agree to the experimental data .",
    "the reason for the good reproduction is because the significant breaking of 2-@xmath3 clusters in @xmath0be is described in the present calculations .",
    "it is the same reason as the previous studies of @xmath5c in which the experimental data concerning the strength of @xmath135 and @xmath136 decays have been well reproduced .",
    "the quantitative discussion of the 2@xmath3-core breaking will be given in the next section .    in table [ tab : be11be2 ] , we show the theoretical @xmath147 values .",
    "it has been proved that amd calculations reproduce well @xmath147 values of light neutron - rich nuclei . as shown in the previous studies @xcite , the experimental @xmath148-moments and @xmath147 values of various nuclei",
    "have been reproduced well by using the bare charges in the amd framework because of the advantage of the amd method which can directly describe proton deformations .",
    "also in the present results , the features of proton - matter deformations in the intrinsic states are reflected in the theoretical @xmath147 values . in the lowest negative parity band @xmath88 , the intrinsic system deforms",
    "because of 2 @xmath3-cluster cores although the development of clustering is smallest comparing with the other bands .",
    "@xmath147 values are larger in the ground @xmath83 band which has the developed clustering structure with a large deformation .",
    "the @xmath147 values are enhanced between the states in the second negative parity band @xmath106 with an extremely large deformation due to the clustering development .",
    ".[tab : be11beta ] log(ft ) values of the @xmath8 transitions .",
    "the theoretical values are obtained from the gamow - teller transition strength .",
    "the experimental data of @xmath8 decays from @xmath0li are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "log@xmath140 values concerning the gamow - teller transition from @xmath0b are deduced from the charge exchange reactions @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     comparing with the previous amd studies of low - lying states of @xmath0be @xcite , another improvement in the present framework is treating the intrinsic spin functions as variational parameters . in the table[tab : be11vbp ] , the effect of the flexible intrinsic spins are seen in the difference between ( c ) the vap calculations with the fixed intrinsic spins and ( d ) the vap calculations with the variational intrinsic spins .",
    "the treatment of flexible intrinsic spins gives an important effect on the parity inversion of @xmath0be .",
    "it reduces @xmath149 to a 1.1 mev smaller value in ( d ) than that in the calculations ( c ) .",
    "the importance of the flexible intrinsic spins in @xmath150 shell - closure states has been already argued in the studies of @xmath5c @xcite by one of the authors . in the case of @xmath0be , it is natural to consider that the @xmath150 sub - shell effect is one of the reasons for the parity inversion because the @xmath151-orbit sould be raised relatively higher than @xmath152-orbits .",
    "unfortunately , the simple amd method with the fixed intrinsic spins describe the sub - shell effects insufficiently .",
    "this is one of the advantages of the present framework which can describe well both aspects of the clustering and shell effects .    regarding the other reasons of parity inversion , sagawa et al .",
    "@xcite and dot et al .",
    "@xcite suggested the paring effects in the neutron @xmath153-shell . in the present framework ,",
    "a part of the paring effects in @xmath153-shell should be included automatically by the spin - parity projections and the superpositions .    as mentioned above , the clustering effects , the three - body forces , the @xmath150 sub - shell effects",
    "are included in the present calculations .",
    "the paring effects are expected to be partially contained .",
    "the other effect which should be important for parity inversion is the neutron - halo effect@xcite . according to the study in ref.@xcite , the effect due to the neutron halo structure",
    "is estimated as 0.6 mev reduction of @xmath149 .",
    "however the halo effect is not taken into account in the present calculations .",
    "we think that this halo effect and the residual paring effect are contained effectively in the strength parameter @xmath154 mev of the spin - orbit force which is slightly stronger that the parameter @xmath155 mev adopted in ref.@xcite .",
    "the halo structures should be important only for the loosely bound states with low - spin orbits such as @xmath145-orbits and @xmath153-orbits at most .",
    "the present strong effective spin - orbit force in case(1 ) may artificially reduce too much the theoretical excitation energies of the other states in @xmath112 band except for the @xmath10 state . before concluding the relative position of the energies between @xmath113 and @xmath156 bands we should more detailed researches by taking the remained effects such as the halo structure into consideration .",
    "we studied the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be with vap calculations in the framework of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics .",
    "various kinds of excited states with the clustering structures and also the non - clustering structures were discovered in the theoretical results .",
    "we predicted many excited states .",
    "most of the states belong to three rotational bands : @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which are dominated by @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath6 configurations , respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out that the formation of 2 @xmath3-cluster cores is seen in many excited states of @xmath0be in the the present resutls in spite of no assumption of the existence of clusters .",
    "the interesting point is that an eccentric rotational band @xmath114 with the mostly developed clustering structure starts from the @xmath157 state at about 4 mev and reaches high spin states .",
    "the experimental data concerning the @xmath136-decay and @xmath135-decay strength were reproduced well .",
    "we also argued that the cluster breaking plays an important role to allow the @xmath8 decays from @xmath0li .",
    "the significant breaking of 2-@xmath3 cores in the states in @xmath113 band has been seen in quantitatively estimating the breaking of clusters .",
    "we discovered a non - clustering state at about 10 mev .",
    "one of the characteristics of this state is the strong @xmath8 decays from @xmath0li , which well corresponds to the new excited states at 8.04 mev found in the @xmath135-decay measurements .    by analyzing the single - particle wave functions in the intrinsic states",
    ", it was found that the molecular @xmath158-orbits surrounding 2-@xmath3 cores play important roles in the clustering structures of @xmath0be . in the ground band @xmath112",
    ", one neutron occupies the @xmath158-orbits . in the newly predicted @xmath114 band",
    "is dominated by @xmath6 configurations with two neutrons in the @xmath158-orbit .",
    "when the surrounding neutrons occupy the @xmath158-orbits , the clustering development is enhanced so as to gain their kinetic energy . in another word ,",
    "one of the reasons for the parity inversion and the low - lying @xmath6 states is the energy gain of the @xmath158-orbits with the developed clustering structures .",
    "concerning the mechanism of the parity inversion , we described the importance of molecular neutron orbits in the developed clustering structure and also mentioned about the @xmath150 sub - shell effect . although the spin parity of the ground state is described with a set of interaction parameters case ( 1 ) , we need more detailed researches taking the halo structures of the ground state into account .",
