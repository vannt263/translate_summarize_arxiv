    "semiempirical models for metallic binding have had a long and successful history in computer modelling .",
    "the most significant development came in the mid eighties with the implementation of ` embedded atom ' potentials @xcite based loosely on density functional theory @xcite and ` n - body ' potentials @xcite based on the tight binding second moment approximation @xcite .",
    "although the rationale for these potentials suggests applicability to free - electron and transition metal systems respectively , the implied functional form is similar in each case .",
    "a large number of successful parameterisations of the functional forms suggested by these methods have been used , and they have established themselves as the standard method for modelling metallic systems .    in the second moment",
    "approximation to tight binding , the cohesive energy is proportional to the square root of the bandwidth , which can be approximated as a sum of pairwise potentials representing squared hopping integrals . assuming atomic charge neutrality , this argument can be extended to all band occupancies and shapes @xcite . for simplicity , consider a rectangular @xmath0-band of full width w centred on the atomic energy level @xmath1 .",
    "the energy for this band relative to the free atom ( the _ bond energy _ ) is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the occupation of the band and @xmath4 the capacity ( for @xmath0-bands n=10 , for @xmath5-bands n=2 ) .",
    "the band width is defined as the square root of the second moment of the density of states .",
    "if we project the density of states onto each atom , and assume that each atom is charge neutral then the energy becomes : @xmath6 and the second moment of the density of states can be calculated as the sum of the squares of the hopping integrals to nearest neighbours .",
    "this latter operation can be written as a sum of pair potentials , @xmath7 the enormous success of finnis - sinclair ( and embedded atom - type ) potentials arises from their extreme computational efficiency : essentially they are no more computationally expensive than a conventional pair potential .",
    "this allows them to be applied to extremely large scale simulations , addressing complex geometries and phenomena which are intractability with more accurate quantum mechanical models .",
    "the computational simplicity follows from the formal division of the energy into a sum of energies per atom , which can in turn be evaluated locally .",
    "here we follow a similar philosophy , seeking to incorporate as much of the relevant physics as possible , without increasing computational cost .",
    "the alkali and alkaline earth metals appear at first glance to be close packed metals , forming fcc , hcp or bcc structures at ambient pressures .",
    "however , compared with transition metals they are easily compressible , and at high pressures adopt more complex `` open '' structures ( with smaller interatomic distances ) .",
    "the simple picture of the physics here is of a transfer of electrons from an @xmath5 to a @xmath0 band @xcite , the @xmath0-band being more compact but higher in energy .",
    "hence , at the price of increasing their _ energy , u _ , atoms can reduce their _ volume , v _ , and since the stable structure at 0k is determined by minimum _",
    "enthalpy , h = u+pv _ at high pressure this transfer becomes energetically favourable .",
    "the net result is a metal - metal phase transformation characterised by a large reduction in volume ( and often also in conductivity ) , the crystal structure itself is not the primary order parameter , and in some cases the transition may even be isostructural .",
    "the mechanism of the phase transition is unknown .",
    "although it is obvious that an isostructural phase transition is accompanied by an instability of the bulk modulus , the onset of this instability may occur after that in the shear modulus .",
    "thus the mechanism may involve shearing rather than isostructural collapse , particularly if a continuous interface between the two phases exists , as in a shockwave @xcite .",
    "the finnis sinclair formalism has been successfully used to study a large variety of systems . however , we are interested in systems in which electrons change from one type of orbit to another and in particular , from an @xmath5-type orbital to a @xmath0-type orbital as the sample is pressurised .",
    "consider therefore two rectangular bands of widths @xmath8 and @xmath9 as shown in figure  [ fig : twobands ]     schematic picture of dos in rectangular two band model .",
    "shaded region shows those energy states actually occupied . ]    with widths evaluated using equation  [ eqn : phisum ] .",
    "the bond energy of an atom may be written as the sum of the bond energies of the two bands on that atom as in equation  [ eqn : ui ] , and a third term giving the energy of promotion from band 1 to band 2 ( see equation  [ eqn : e_promo ] ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the capacities of the bands and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the numbers of electrons in each band on the @xmath15 atom .",
    "for an element , enforcing charge neutrality , the sum of the numbers of electrons is necessarily constrained to be equal to the total number of electrons on an atom , @xmath16 the difference between the energies of the band centres @xmath17 and @xmath18 is assumed to be fixed .",
    "the values of @xmath19 correspond to the appropriate energy levels in the isolated atom .",
    "thus , @xmath20 is the excitation energy from one level to another . for alkali and alkaline earth metals",
    ", the free atom occupies only @xmath5-orbitals , so the promotion energy term is therefore simply @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "thus the band energy can be written as a function of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the bandwidths ( evaluated at each atom as a sum of pair potentials , within the second moment approximation ) . defining : @xmath23 and using equation  [ eqn : tot ] we can write :    @xmath24    although this expression looks unwieldy , it is in fact computationally efficient , requiring for its evaluation only two sums of pair potentials for @xmath25 ( see equation  [ eqn : phisum ] ) and a minimisation _ at each site independently _ with respect to @xmath26 . since they are local variables , it is possible to write closed form expressions for @xmath26 which minimise the total energy ( see equation [ eqn : n_options ] ) .",
    "in addition to the bonding term , the finnis - sinclair form includes a pairwise repulsion between the ions , which is due primarily to the screened ionic charge and orthogonalisation of the valence electrons . in the present case",
    ", this pair potential should be a function of @xmath26 . in keeping with maintaining locality of the energy we write the pairwise contribution to the energy in the intuitive form , as the sum of two terms , one from each `` band '' , proportional to the number of electrons in that band",
    "@xmath27 we rearrange this to give the energy as a sum over atoms @xmath28\\ ] ]    the total energy is now simply @xmath29 this depends on @xmath26 , but as described above the @xmath26 take the values which minimise the energy and one can solve : @xmath30 explicitly for @xmath31 independently at each atom , whence    @xmath32 \\,.\\ ] ]    depending on the number of electrons in the system it may not be possible to realise this .",
    "charge neutrality requires that @xmath33 can not be greater than the total number of electrons @xmath34 per atom .",
    "the fixed capacities of the bands ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) can also prohibit the realisation of @xmath31 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to limit the values which @xmath26 may have : @xmath35 where @xmath31 is given by equation  [ eqn : mu0 ] .",
    "the expressions for @xmath26 involves only constants and sums of pair potentials , and can be evaluated independently at each atom at a similar computational cost to a standard many - body type potential .",
    "since the energy is variational in @xmath26 within this model , we have @xmath36 and the force on the @xmath37 atom is @xmath38 hence the force is simply the derivative of the energy at fixed @xmath39 .",
    "basically , this is the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite which arises here because @xmath39 is essentially a single parameter representation of the electronic structure .",
    "this result means that , like the energy , the force can be evaluated by summing pairwise potentials .",
    "hence the model is well suited for large scale molecular dynamics .",
    "the force derivation is somewhat tedious ( see appendix  [ appendix - force ] ) , the result being : @xmath40\\hat{\\bf r}_{ij } \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 and where the numbers of electrons in each band , @xmath42 , have been calculated analytically using equations [ eqn : mu0 ] , [ eqn : n_options ] and [ eqn : distdef ] .",
    "the contribution to the force from each neighbour acts along the direction of the vector between the atoms .",
    "one application of the model is to simulate the pressure - induced isostructural phase transition in materials such as caesium . here",
    "the transformation arises from electronic transition from the @xmath5 to the @xmath0-band .",
    "caesium adopts the bcc structure ( cs i ) at ambient pressure , transforming under slight additional pressure to fcc ( cs ii ) and under further increase transforming isostructurally to fcc ( cs iii ) @xcite .",
    "here we seek to represent the volume collapse cs ii @xmath43 cs iii transition .",
    "to make a usable potential , the functional forms of @xmath44 and @xmath45 must be chosen .",
    "although this is somewhat arbitrary , the physical picture of hopping integral and screened ion - ion potential suggests that both should be short ranged , continuous and reasonably smooth .    in the present case , we are interested in the gross features of the model , so we adopt simple forms fitted to the cohesive energies and volume of the high and low pressure polytypes of caesium . for more complex applications",
    ", it may be necessary to fit other properties .    following finnis and sinclair , we choose for the hopping integral @xmath46 and for the pairwise part , following lennard - jones @xmath47 where @xmath48 labels the band .",
    "we select the promotion energy @xmath1 to be that required to promote an electron from the @xmath49 level into the @xmath50 level of an isolated atom  @xcite .",
    "the band capacities are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the total number of electrons per atom is @xmath53 . the cutoff radii @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "are chosen to be between the second and third nearest neighbours and between the first and second nearest neighbours respectively .",
    "the remaining four parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) are available for fitting .    _",
    "ab initio _ calculations using pseudopotentials , plane waves and the generalized gradient approximation  @xcite show that the energy - volume relations for bcc and fcc caesium are almost degenerate , so we have fitted the remaining parameters to the atomic volumes of cs  i ( 115.9 @xmath60/atom ) , cs  ii ( 67.5 @xmath60/atom ) and cs  iii ( 48.7 @xmath60/atom ) @xcite as well as the transition pressure between phases ii and iii ( 4.3 gpa ) @xcite and the cohesive energy of phase i ( -0.704 ev ) . the cohesive energy is the sum of the heat of formation and the heat of vaporisation  @xcite .",
    "initial estimates for the parameters were determined using a symbolic mathematics package .",
    "the final parameters were arrived at by an iterative process : least squares , conjugate gradients and _ ab oculo _ minimisation techniques were used to determine the best parameters for particular cutoff radii .",
    "the cutoff radii were then adjusted by hand to improve the fit .",
    "this process was repeated until the optimum fit was achieved .",
    "the final parameters are given in table  [ table : tb - params ] .",
    ".[table : tb - params]parameters for the two band model , obtained by fitting to phases ii and iii of caesium . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in principle , the current formalism should be applicable to @xmath0-band metals .",
    "we do not intend to refit the potentials here , but by applying the parameters fitted for caesium with appropriate scaling for ionic charge , and simply varying the total number of electrons we recover the parabolic behaviour of the cohesive energy and bulk modulus which characterises the transition metal series .",
    "considering that there are no fitting parameters , the agreement with experimental results is extraordinarily good .",
    "moreover , the volume collapse phase transition exists only for n=1 and n=2 ( consistent with experiment ) .",
    "however , since no information about band shape is included , the sequence of crystal structures can not be reproduced , so we consider here only the fcc structures , calculating their `` experimental '' values from the experimental density .    while the extrapolated potentials do not represent the optimal parametrisation for specific transition metals , the recovery of the trends across the group lends weight to the idea that the two - band model correctly reproduces the physics of this series .",
    "extrapolation of model to various 6s5d - band materials .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are taken from the fit to caesium , with the lengths being scaled according to the fermi vector ( @xmath61 ) and the energies by ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the lattice parameters are shown by the solid line ( calculated ) and circles ( experiment ) and the cohesive energies by dashed line ( calculated ) and squares ( experiment ) .",
    "calculations are actually done at integer values of @xmath34 and lines join these points . ]",
    "we have presented a model to describe @xmath63 transfer within the framework of the empirical second - moment tight binding model . with a very simple parametrisation",
    ", our model describes the isostructural phase transition and associated @xmath63 transfer in cs and allows study of the elastic instabilities which occur under pressure and uniaxial stress . throughout",
    ", our formalism is guided by the principle of retaining as much electronic detail as possible within the constraint of the computational complexity of short - ranged pair potentials    our potential form involves evaluation of sums of pair potentials , and minimisation of the energy with respect to band occupation . in the approximation of local density of states evaluated at each atom ,",
    "it becomes possible to formally write the energy of each atom in terms of the local band occupation , a single parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this variational parameter can be explicitly eliminated from the energy and force expressions , meaning that energies and forces can be evaluated by summing pair potentials .    to our knowledge",
    ", the present potential represents the most sophisticated energy function which has first derivatives which are analytic pair potentials , and the first exploitation of the hellman - feynman theorem in empirical potentials to achieve this .",
    "it is thus uniquely well suited for exploitation in standard molecular dynamics codes .",
    "extension of the formalism to transition metals is straightforward , and the caesium parametrisation gives a surprisingly good description across the group . while providing impressive proof of concept ,",
    "this may not be of enormous practical use , however , since once there is a significant partial occupation of the @xmath0-band under all conditions the model is similar to the standard many - body potentials which are known to do a good job in describing transition metals .",
    "the precise stable crystal symmetry depends on the shape of the band structure , and is not therefore correctly described in this rectangular band model .",
    "many - body potentials never contain the correct physics to describe phase transitions , except in the martensitic case of freezing in soft phonons @xcite .",
    "however , the crystal structure which has the lowest energy can be determined by judicious choice of functions @xmath45 and @xmath44 . here",
    "the simple use of power law repulsion and cubic attraction leads to close packed structures .",
    "the two - band formalism can be easily combined with alternate parameterisations to get effective band shapes , and could be applied to ferromagnetic systems where the two bands represent separate spins , and the atomic @xmath1 term is replaced by a term which favours maximum spin .",

    "there is a degree of confusion in the literature regarding the definition of elastic constants under pressure .",
    "to some extent this arises because of various definitions of strain ( lagrangian , eulerian , volume conserving ) .",
    "here we lay out the definitions in terms of energy .",
    "one important point to note is that under pressure the moduli which correspond to long wavelength phonons are volume conserving , while those corresponding to crystal stability are not . at finite pressure , this means they are different .    at pressure ,",
    "the important quantity for stability in energetic terms is the gibbs free energy @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 where p is an externally applied hydrostatic pressure .",
    "@xmath67 is the helmholtz free energy f. the change in the gibbs energy due to a distortion of the crystal is @xmath68 if the hydrostatic pressure is applied by an external mechanism then @xmath69 is zero .",
    "therefore @xmath70    any arbitrary change in the unit cell be expressed in terms of the strain tensor @xmath71 . using voigt notation ,",
    "the matrix representation of the strain tensor is written as @xmath72    if we write the equilibrium cell as a matrix comprising the three lattice vectors @xmath73 , then any arbitrary strain give a new unit cell : @xmath74    if the volume of the original cell is @xmath75 , then the volume of the new cell is @xmath76    which can be expressed concisely in standard strain notation ( @xmath77 representing cartesian directions ) as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the kroneker delta and the usual implicit sum convention for tensors applies . the change in the gibbs free energy",
    "may then be written @xmath80    we define @xmath81 as the second order derivatives of the helmholtz free energy with respect to the voigt strains . and @xmath82 as the second order derivatives of the gibbs free energy with respect to the voigt strains .",
    "the limiting case of long wavelength phonons is related to @xmath81 which can be calculated from the dynamical matrix @xcite , the crystal stability criteria are related to the @xmath82 @xcite . in the standard notation : @xmath83 in voigt notation : @xmath84    the born elastic stability criteria restrict what values various moduli may have if the crystal is to be stable  @xcite . in the case of external pressure the relevant free energy is @xmath65 and the relevant moduli are @xmath82 . due to the voigt symmetry , the elastic constant tensor has in general , only 21 independent components . in cubic crystals",
    "however this number is further reduced by symmetry to 3 , namely @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , there are three common stability criteria which impose lower bounds on the bulk , shear and tetragonal shear moduli of cubic crystals .",
    "these may be written in voigt notation : @xmath88 whence the generalised born stability criteria for the elastic constants of cubic crystals at pressure become : @xmath89 where @xmath90      in this paper we evaluate the elastic moduli by applying finite strain and measuring the change in total energy @xmath91 .",
    "the finite strain method has the advantage over analytic differentiation of automatically compensating for non - isotropic movement of the atoms . at zero temperature @xmath91",
    "is the same as the classical helmholtz free energy @xmath92 . at finite pressure , however , the system is not at a minimum of @xmath91 with respect to strain .    when applying strain to a system under pressure , the first order term in the gibbs free energy vanishes : @xmath93 but the first order term for helmholtz does not .",
    "for a cubic crystal , one can find @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 directly at any volume by simple distortions and measurement of @xmath92 .    for bulk modulus we apply a pair of voigt strains , with @xmath97 , the other elements being zero .",
    "assuming we make a pair of small distortions about a volume v , the difference @xmath98 equivalently , using the helmholtz free energy @xmath99    for @xmath95 , the relevant distortion , volume conserving to first order , is @xmath100 and @xmath101    for @xmath102 , the relevant distortion is @xmath103 and @xmath104",
