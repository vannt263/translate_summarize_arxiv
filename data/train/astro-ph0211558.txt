    "lmc  x@xmath04 is an eclipsing high - mass disk - fed accretion - powered binary x - ray pulsar in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "a spin period of 13.5 s was discovered in lmc  x@xmath04 by kelley et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and x - ray eclipses with a 1.4 day recurring period was discovered by li et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and white ( 1978 ) .",
    "the x - ray intensity varies by a factor of @xmath1 60 between high and low states with a periodic cycle time of 30.5 day ( lang et al . 1981 ; paul & kitamoto 2002 ) .",
    "flux modulation at super - orbital period in lmc  x@xmath04 is believed to be due to blockage of the direct x - ray beam by its precessing tilted accretion disk , as in the archetypal system her  x@xmath01 . flaring events of duration ranging from @xmath1 20 s to 45 minutes ( levine et al . 1991 and references therein )",
    "are seen about once in a day during which the source intensity increases by factors up to @xmath1 20 .",
    "broad band spectroscopy using ginga and rosat data shows that the continuum can be modeled with a high energy cut - off power - law ( woo et al .",
    "the spectrum also shows a soft excess and a broad iron emission line .",
    "the soft excess detected with rosat was modeled as combination of thermal bremsstrahlung and very soft black - body by woo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , while the same observed with beppo - sax ( la barbera et al .",
    "2001 ) was modeled as black - body emission from accretion disk at magnetoshperic radius comptonized by moderately hot electrons .",
    "la barbera et al . ( 2001 ) also reported the presence of a cyclotron absorption line at @xmath1 100 kev .",
    "in this paper we present the spectral variations of lmc  x@xmath04 during the 30.5 day long period using the archival data from rxte observations .",
    "to study the super - orbital phase dependence of various spectral parameters , we have analyzed 43 rxte / pca observations of lmc  x@xmath04 at different phases of the 30.5 day third period .",
    "the data used for analysis are out - of - eclipse and free from the the flaring state .",
    "energy spectra in 129 channel were generated from the standard 2 mode pca data .",
    "the standard procedures for data selection , and response matrix generation were followed .",
    "background estimation was done using both bright and faint models of rxte / pca according to different intensity states of the source at different phases .",
    "we restricted our analysis to 3 @xmath0 25 kev energy range .",
    "data from all five pcus are added together .",
    "we have fitted the energy spectrum of the source using a model consisting of blackbody , power law and a high energy cutoff as model components .",
    "we have included a gaussian line near the expected k@xmath2 emission from iron and absorption edge due to iron .",
    "the value of equivalent hydrogen column density n@xmath3 was set to have a lower threshold of 0.055 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 which is the galactic column density towards this source .",
    "the blackbody temperature was kept fixed at kt @xmath7 0.2 kev , while the center and width of the iron emission line was fixed at 6.4 kev and 0.65 kev respectively with free normalization .",
    "the variation in 3 @xmath0 25 kev source flux during the rxte / pca observations are shown in the left panel of figure 1 whereas the right panel of figure 1 shows the energy spectrum for one of the observations at high intensity state .",
    "the variation of iron line flux and iron equivalent width with the source flux in 7@xmath025 kev energy range are shown in the left and right panels of figure 2 respectively .",
    "the results obtained from this work are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the iron emission line flux is found to be directly correlated with the source flux in 7 @xmath0 25 kev energy range .",
    "\\(ii ) the source spectrum is found to be flat with power - law photon index in the range 0.5 @xmath0 0.7 during low intensity state ( source flux @xmath8 3 @xmath4 10@xmath9 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath10 at 3@xmath025 kev energy range ) whereas during high intensity state , the spectrum is steep with power - law photon index in the range 0.7 @xmath0 0.9 .",
    "\\(iii ) equivalent width of the iron emission line is found to be highly variable in the range 0.25 @xmath0 1.1 kev during low intensity state ( source flux @xmath8 2 @xmath4 10@xmath9 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath10 in 7@xmath025 kev energy range ) , whereas it remains almost constant ( 0.2 @xmath0 0.35 kev ) during the high intensity state with source flux @xmath11 2 @xmath4 10@xmath9 ergs @xmath6 s@xmath10 in 7@xmath025 kev energy range .",
    "according to the results of the present work , it is observed that iron intensity correlates very well with the continuum intensity in 7 @xmath0 25 kev energy range .",
    "the equivalent width of the iron emission line is very high at low luminosity .",
    "similar thing was found in vela x@xmath01 ( becker et al .",
    "1979 ; white et al . 1983 ) .",
    "in vela x@xmath01 , it can be due to increase in absorption caused by the stellar wind of the primary .",
    "nagase et al .",
    "( 1986 ) studied the change in equivalent widths of iron emission line against the column density of matter in the line of sight for vela  x@xmath01 .",
    "similar studies were done for gx  301@xmath02 by makino et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and for her  x@xmath01 by makishima ( 1986 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the column density averaged over the whole direction does not change appreciably , whereas the absorption column density along the line of sight changes drastically with time and orbital phase .",
    "inoue ( 1985 ) and makishima ( 1986 ) estimated the equivalent widths of the fluorescence iron line emission from neutral matter in a sphere surrounding the x - ray source using a power law type incident spectrum .",
    "they found that , if the matter is located between the x - ray source and the observer , the continuum spectrum is absorbed by the matter resulting in increasing the equivalent width monotonically with the column density as observed in gx  301@xmath02 ( makino et al .",
    "however , when the x - ray source is hidden by some thick material , the equivalent width remains almost constant ( @xmath1 1 kev ) ( as observed from vela  x@xmath01 during the eclipse ; nagase et al .",
    "1984 ) . in case of accretion powered x - ray pulsars ,",
    "if the compact object is hidden from direct view by the accretion disk and only x - rays scattered into the line of sight by an accretion disk corona or wind are visible , the iron equivalent width can be higher .",
    "this may explain the higher value of iron equivalent width during the low intensity states of lmc  x@xmath04 .",
    "work of sn is partially supported by the kanwal rekhi scholarship of the tifr endowment fund .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
