    "the coupling of randomness with algebraic or arithmetic structures can lead to beautiful combinatorial results .",

    "recently , lam studied markov chains that can be represented geometrically as random walks on a regular tessellation of a vector space on which an affine weyl group acts @xcite . when this weyl group is a symmetric group , the stationary distribution of the chain displays remarkable combinatorial properties that were further explored by lam and williams , leading to various conjectures @xcite .",
    "the markov chain studied in @xcite is equivalent to a multi - species exclusion process with inhomogeneous transition rates as shown by ayyer and linusson in a very recent publication @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the powerful techniques that were developed in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics to analyze the asymmetric exclusion process @xcite should be relevant to this more mathematical problem . indeed , ayyer and linusson conjectured that the stationary state can be obtained by generalizing the elegant graphical algorithm , invented by ferrari and martin @xcite to solve the homogeneous @xmath0-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( @xmath0-tasep ) ; in @xcite , they generalized ferrari and martin s algorithm and explored the consequences for lam and williams conjectures .    in the present work ,",
    "we solve the @xmath0-tasep with inhomogeneous transition rates by using a generalized matrix product ansatz .",
    "more precisely , we show that a suitable deformation of the homogeneous algebra studied in @xcite allows us to calculate the stationary state of the inhomogeneous @xmath0-tasep .",
    "we also show that our matrix product solution is equivalent to the algorithm conjectured in @xcite .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section [ sec : def ] , the model is defined . in section [ sec : mpa ] , we give a matrix product solution to the stationary state . in section [ sec :",
    "fmalalgo ] , we explain the graphical construction of the stationary state conjectured by ayyer and linusson , and we show that this construction is equivalent to the matrix product solution . we give concluding remarks in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider an @xmath1-site periodic chain in which each site takes a non - negative integer value @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( this is called the _",
    "n - species _ problem ) .",
    "each pair of nearest neighbor sites exchanges their values according to the following continuous time stochastic dynamics : @xmath4 the special case @xmath5 for all @xmath6 corresponds to the _ homogeneous _",
    "@xmath0-tasep @xcite .",
    "when the transition rates @xmath7 s are not equal to each other , we say that this dynamics is _ inhomogeneous _",
    "( although one could consider even more complicated or general transition rules ) .",
    "when @xmath8 , and there is exactly one particle of each species in the system , the process is equivalent to lam and williams process on the symmetric group @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous @xmath0-tasep is governed by the master equation @xmath10 for the vector @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the probability of finding the system in a configuration @xmath13 .",
    "the generator matrix ( markov matrix ) @xmath14 is the summation of local operators @xmath15 that acts on the spaces corresponding to @xmath16th and @xmath17st sites of the chain : @xmath18    we write @xmath19 for the sector that contains @xmath20 particles of type @xmath21 . because of the conservation of the number of particles of each type",
    ", we have the decomposition @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we consider _ basic sectors _ , i.e. @xmath23 . since the identification of local states @xmath24 maps the @xmath0-species dynamics to the @xmath25-species dynamics , we have the spectral inclusion : the spectrum of the sector @xmath26 contains that of the sector @xmath27 .",
    "this inclusion relation indicates that there exists a `` conjugation matrix '' @xmath28 such that @xmath29 this matrix allows one to lift states that belong to the @xmath25-species sector @xmath30 and to construct eigenstates for the @xmath0-species sector @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , the stationary state of the @xmath0-tasep ( the kernel of @xmath14 ) can be constructed recursively if one knows the sequence of the conjugation matrices .",
    "the idea of the matrix product ansatz is to express the probability of finding each configuration @xmath13 as a trace over a suitable algebra @xmath32 with a normalization constant @xmath33 .",
    "the operators @xmath34 s must satisfy suitable algebraic relations , which are usually infinite dimensional @xcite .",
    "for the homogeneous @xmath0-tasep , the operators @xmath34 were constructed recursively @xcite as tensor products of four fundamental operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 that act on an infinite dimensional space @xmath37 as @xmath38 one can easily verify that the following quadratic relations are satisfied : @xmath39 in @xcite , the stationary state for the homogeneous @xmath0-tasep has been expressed as a matrix product form , using an algebraic interpretation of ferrari and martin s algorithm @xcite .",
    "more recently the matrix product ansatz technique was generalized to obtain a conjugation matrix that satisfies `` conjugation relation '' ( [ eq : conjugation - relation ] ) between systems having different numbers of species @xcite .",
    "we now explain how the same ideas can be adapted to the inhomogeneous case .",
    "the stationary state for @xmath40 case is trivial , i.e. all the possible states in each sector are realized with a same probability .",
    "this can be regarded as one dimensional representation of the matrices @xmath41 .      for @xmath42 ,",
    "a matrix product stationary representation has been known , even in the inhomogeneous case @xcite .",
    "one possible choice for the algebra is @xmath43 defining an operator - valued vector @xmath44 , we observe that the following decomposition exists @xmath45 where we have set @xmath46 and the matrices @xmath47 satisfy  ( [ eq : dehp ] ) .",
    "this decomposition can be written more formally as the product of two rectangular operator - valued matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 of sizes @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively @xmath52 where the symbol @xmath53 means that we perform tensor products amongst the elements of the matrices @xmath49 and @xmath48 .",
    "more generally , for matrix - valued matrices @xmath54 , it represents the product @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 and @xmath57 are scalars here , the tensor product reduces to the ordinary product .",
    "finally , we observe that the matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 satisfies @xmath58 where @xmath59 since @xmath60 , equation ( [ intertw1 ] ) is the relation in the usual matrix product ansatz @xcite .",
    "the relation ( [ intertw2 ] ) implies that the matrix @xmath28 whose elements are given as @xmath61 intertwines the dynamics of the sectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 , i.e. it satisfies equation ( [ eq : conjugation - relation ] ) .",
    "formally we write the stationary state for the sector @xmath30 as @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "then the stationary state for the sector @xmath31 can be rewritten as @xmath66 .    for a simple nontrivial example",
    ", the stationary state of the sector @xmath67 is given as @xmath68      we now explain the generalized matrix product ansatz for general values of @xmath0 ( see @xcite for more details ) . reversing the construction in the last subsection , we start with the following relation that we call `` hat relation '' : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are operator - valued matrices of size @xmath72 .",
    "we write their elements as @xmath73 , @xmath74 . we know that , if we can construct a couple @xmath75 ( for the general integer of @xmath0 ) that satisfies , the matrix @xmath28 defined as @xmath76 satisfies the conjugation relation ( [ eq : conjugation - relation ] ) . here",
    "the configurations @xmath77 and @xmath78 belong to the sectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the stationary state of the sector @xmath31 can be written by the product of conjugation matrices @xmath81 if all of them are nonzero ( we note that the conjugation matrix @xmath82 lifts up other eigenstates from lower sectors as well ) .",

    "is given by @xmath85 the difference from the homogeneous case appears in @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",

    ", one can show that equations ( [ eq : rep1 ] ) , ( [ eq : rep2 ] ) give a representation to the algebra defined by the hat relation ( [ eq : hat ] ) i.e. @xmath91 it is straightforward to prove that the above relations are satisfied simply by substituting equations ( [ eq : rep1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rep2 ] ) .",
    "in appendix , we prove the first identity ( [ eq : alg1 ] ) as an example . for @xmath92 and 4 ,",
    "the result can be written explicitly as @xmath93 @xmath94    we now generalize the form ( [ decompx2 ] ) or ( [ formaldecompx2 ] ) .",

    "this specificity is because the numbers of @xmath96 s and @xmath97 s are different in the matrix product , see @xcite for details . ] .",

    "this implies that the matrix product is transformed into a tensor product of the form @xmath111 multiplied by a monomial of @xmath112 s ( by applying the relation ( [ eq : dehp ] ) and @xmath113 ) , otherwise it is 0 . since @xmath114 ,",

    "we first review the algorithm that a. ayyer and s. linusson devised @xcite to calculate the stationary weights by defining an inhomogeneous extension of the seminal algorithm by ferrari and martin@xcite .",
    "then we show that the solution to the matrix product ansatz of the previous section is equivalent to ayyer and linusson s construction .      the algorithm of ayyer and linusson @xcite constructs the stationary state of the @xmath0-species sector @xmath99 from the @xmath25-species sector @xmath115 .",
