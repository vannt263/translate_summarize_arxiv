    "<S> the dirac carriers are heated by metallic free carrier absorption @xcite , where the peak electronic temperature is determined by the pump fluence @xcite .    here , we introduce a new mechanism , active when an infrared optical field is made resonant with a vibrational mode that modulates the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> we show that anomalous heating of the dirac carrier distribution occurs when the e@xmath0 phonon mode of bilayer graphene @xcite is driven to large amplitudes with a coherent mid - infrared field . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is particularly interesting as it exhibits a pronounced fano profile and large oscillator strength in the conductivity spectrum , originating from an anomalously strong coupling to electronic interband transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , the e@xmath0 motion of the two triangular lattice units ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) is expected to periodically open and close a band gap at the k - point @xcite , a prospect of general interest for the physics of graphene . finally , the frequency of the mode is fast compared to the electron - phonon scattering time , resulting in a breakdown of the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation as proposed in the context of raman scattering experiments for monolayer graphene @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the resulting non - equilibrium dirac carrier distributions were tracked with tr - arpes as a function of pump - probe time delay using extreme ultra - violet ( xuv ) femtosecond pulses at 31ev photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were performed at 30k base temperature .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we present snapshots of the carrier distributions ( upper panel ) of bilayer graphene , along with the pump - induced changes of the photocurrent ( lower panel ) for different pump - probe delays after excitation of the e@xmath0 lattice vibration at @xmath11@xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements were taken along the @xmath6k - direction , where only two of the four @xmath7-bands are visible due to photoemission matrix element effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> zero time delay was set to the peak of the pump - probe signal .    </S>",
    "<S> consistent with previous measurements performed in the free carrier absorption regime @xcite , we observe a broadening of the fermi edge due to an increase in electronic temperature , without signature of population inversion . </S>",

    "<S> the time evolution of the fermi width ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) is found to follow a double exponential decay , generally ascribed to the emission of optical ( @xmath13 ) and acoustic phonons ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments for different excitation wavelengths were performed at a constant pump fluence of f = 0.26mj/@xmath15 ( see @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> comparison with monolayer graphene ( see @xcite ) , where the in - plane lattice vibration is not infrared active and hence can not be excited with light @xcite , clearly indicates that the anomalies observed in the bilayer system are not present . </S>",
    "<S> this is most obvious in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d , where we added the @xmath13 values for monolayer graphene ( black data points ) which are found to be independent of pump wavelength .    the data presented above points then to important differences between excitation on and off resonance with the in - plane lattice vibration , which is interpreted in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of free carrier absorption @xcite , the excitation is a result of periodic acceleration and deceleration of the carriers along the direction of light polarization , @xmath17 ( @xmath6m - direction , green arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> carrier heating occurs in this case because the dirac carriers scatter during this oscillatory motion .    </S>",
    "<S> when excitation is resonant with the e@xmath0 phonon , in addition to this time dependent polarization , one expects a modulation of the band structure , as the motion of the atoms makes the hopping between sites time dependent . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , one can think of the motion of the atoms in real space directly translating into an oscillatory displacement of the dirac cone itself @xcite . note that this motion of the dirac cone occurs along @xmath18 ( @xmath6k - direction , blue arrows fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) , that is , perpendicular to the free carrier absorption occurring along @xmath17 . crucially , since the atomic motion </S>",
    "<S> is fast compared to the electron - phonon scattering time , the electrons do not follow the motion of the atoms promptly and experience a complex motion that breaks the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the physics at hand more quantitatively , we calculate the changes in the band structure for a static lattice distortion along the normal mode coordinate . for a pump field of </S>",
    "<S> approximately 1mv / cm , as employed in our experiments , we estimate atomic displacements of @xmath195pm , @xmath192% of the equilibrium lattice constant ( see @xcite ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b , we report calculated band structures for different lattice distortions along the e@xmath0 normal mode coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> dramatic changes are induced by the vibration , with a momentum - splitting of the @xmath7-bands at the k - point and a huge shift of the @xmath20-bands at the @xmath6-point towards the fermi - level ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory motion of the dirac cone known from the monolayer ( fig . [ fig4]a ) affects the upper and lower layer of the bilayer in opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> together with the interlayer coupling this leads to a splitting of the @xmath7-bands along @xmath6 km that increases with increasing distortion ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non - equilibrium occupancy of the transient electronic states is determined by the complex non - adiabatic motion sketched in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a .    to describe the experimental results we consider how the dynamical changes in the density of states ( see fig . 4 in @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> are expected to affect the electronic temperature . in order to approximately estimate the change in peak electronic temperature due to the e@xmath0 lattice distortion </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that during the lattice distortion both the electron number n(dos,@xmath21,t@xmath12 ) and the entropy of the system s(dos,@xmath21,t@xmath12 ) are conserved ( for further details see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential and the peak electronic temperature in the absence of a lattice distortion are known from off - resonance tr - arpes data ( @xmath22mev , @xmath23k ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on the dos in fig . 4 in @xcite , we obtain @xmath24mev and @xmath25k for an atomic displacement of 3% of the lattice constant , an estimate that can be reconciled with the data . </S>",
    "<S> one may speculate further that the changes in electronic dos affect the electron - phonon coupling constant and result in faster carrier relaxation .    in summary , we have excited monolayer and bilayer graphene at mir wavelengths between 4@xmath1 m and 9@xmath1 m , both on- and off - resonance with the in - plane e@xmath0 mode in bilayer graphene , and probed the response of the electronic structure with tr - arpes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the peak electronic temperature as well as the relaxation rate are significantly perturbed when the excitation is made resonant with the e@xmath0 mode , an effect that is absent in monolayer graphene , in which light can not couple to the in - plane lattice vibration . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the data by discussing the dynamical band structure changes combined with a non - adiabatic temporal response , a genuinely new type of carrier excitation for the solid state . </S>",
    "<S> similar concepts may be extended beyond graphene , for example to the transition metal dichalcogenides , opening up new avenues for electronic structure control with light . </S>",
    "<S> the complex circular motion of the electrons throughout momentum space , which involves ultrafast manipulation of the electronic structure of the system over very few femtoseconds , may be interesting for applications in optoelectronics at very high bit rates . </S>"
