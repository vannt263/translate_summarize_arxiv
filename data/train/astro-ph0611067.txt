    "the understanding of the role played by the environment on galaxy evolution still remains a major issue . a key aspect to understanding the evolution of galaxies in clusters is the knowledge of their star formation ( sf ) history , intimately related to their morphology and gas content .",
    "indeed , it has been reported that the global star formation rates of spiral galaxies located in the innermost regions of nearby and intermediate redshift clusters appear strongly depressed as compared to the results found for similar galaxies at larger clustercentric radii ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "less information is available in the literature with respect to the evolution of the sf activity of the population of dwarf galaxies in clusters . to date , only a handful of works have dealt with the study of the sf activity in the population of star - forming dwarf and irregular galaxies in nearby clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several physical mechanisms have been invoked to explain the influence of the cluster environment on the evolution of star - forming galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "gas - rich late - type galaxies falling for the first time into the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of a rich cluster can suffer compression of their interstellar medium by ram pressure , triggering star formation bursts ; this process can be followed by the stripping of their external gaseous component , thus inducing a quenching of their star formation activity .",
    "in addition , gravitational interactions could give rise to different kinds of tidal interactions : with other galaxies , with the cluster potential , `` harassment '' @xcite .",
    "other important processes include `` starvation '' of galactic gas component and `` preprocessing '' of galaxies in falling groups into clusters @xcite .",
    "overall , sf activity is expected to be more efficient in high velocity objects at the periphery of the clusters , as shown by numerical simulations @xcite . from the observational point of view , it is not yet clear if the sf activity of cluster dwarf irregulars may vary along the clustercentric radius .",
    "it seems clear that dwarf galaxies and large spirals should show different responses to the action of cluster tidal fields as a physical consequence of their different mass concentrations @xcite . to date , there is not enough observational information available on the evolution of star - forming dwarf galaxies in clusters , mostly a consequence of the magnitude - limited searches .",
    "isolated intergalactic hii regions have been recently found in the vicinity of cluster spirals , thus providing evidence for their origin in tidal interactions and from previously processed material @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a population of intergalactic planetary nebulae ( pn ) has been reported to exist in virgo @xcite and in coma @xcite clusters .",
    "obviously the luminosity contrast of the emission lines of hii regions and pn and their relative compactness has allowed them to be detected in nearby clusters , but not in more distant ones given their low luminosities .    a new class of ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucdgs ) in the nearby clusters fornax @xcite and virgo @xcite has been recently discovered .",
    "these galaxies show extremely compact surface brightness profiles and sizes slightly larger than those of stellar clusters , a few tens of pc , with absolute b magnitude -13 @xmath5 -11 @xcite , and typically also present spectra lacking emission - lines .",
    "two explanations for the nature of these galaxies have been proposed : either they are the successors of tidally stripped des , or they have originated from merged young massive clusters of tidal origin @xcite . up to now ,",
    "the typical ucdgs reported in clusters do not appear to show recent star formation activity , thus the possibility of analogous star - forming ucdgs in the cluster environment could shed light on the nature and evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a rather unexplored possibility is the search for very compact , actively star - forming dwarf galaxies in clusters .",
    "these galaxies should show emission lines with high equivalent widths , as shown by pn and hii regions , though their expected intrinsic luminosity would be much larger than in the cases of pn and hii regions , thus favouring their detection in clusters .",
    "besides the work on virgo @xcite and fornax @xcite , there is recent evidence for `` missing '' compact galaxies in the local field , i.e. galaxies that have been misclassified as stars due to their compactness by standard star - galaxy separation techniques , in the millennium galaxy catalogue @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report on the detection and properties of two very compact strong starbursts that have been found associated to the clusters of galaxies abell  539 and abell  634 .",
    "these two objects were discovered by visual inspection of some h@xmath0 frames covering approximately 1@xmath6 1@xmath7 on the basis of their compactness and strong h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the parent clusters are approximately at the same distance ( @xmath8 ) and show rather different properties : whereas abell  539 is a rich x - ray luminous cluster , abell  634 is a poor , disperse cluster , for which only an upper limit in x - ray by rosat is available , probably indicating an ongoing galaxy assembling from the cluster outskirts .",
    "the adopted heliocentric velocities ( velocity dispersions ) for a539 and a634 are 8514  km  s@xmath9 ( @xmath10  km  s@xmath9 ) and 7945  km  s@xmath9 ( @xmath11  km  s@xmath9 ) respectively @xcite . thus assuming standard cosmology with @xmath12  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the distances to the clusters adopted throughout this paper are 124.2 ( abell  539 ) and 115.7  mpc ( abell  634 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  2 describes the observations and data handling .",
    "section  3 enumerates the main observational properties of the two galaxies and in section  4 we discuss their main properties , origin and evolutionary stage .",
    "finally , in section  5 we present our conclusions and final remarks about the relative importance of these kinds of objects for the sfr budget of nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "h@xmath15continuum imaging of the two starburst sources drp - a539a and drp - a634a , were obtained with the wide field camera ( wfc ) attached to the prime focus of the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) , at the observatorio de el roque de los muchachos ( orm ) , la palma , spain , in december 2002 and 2003 , and february 2003 .",
    "the wfc consists of an array of four thinned ar coated eev @xmath16 devices , plus a fifth used for autoguiding .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.33 arcsec pixel@xmath9 , which gives a total field of view of about @xmath17 .",
    "given the particular arrangement of the detectors , a squared area of about @xmath18 is lost in the top right corner of the field .",
    "given the redshift of these objects , an on - band narrow filter ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) to isolate the h@xmath0 emission and an off - band narrow filter ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) to measure the continuum emission corresponding to the redshifted h@xmath0 line were used .",
    "at least four different exposures , slightly dithered to remove cosmic rays , were obtained for each position with each filter .",

    ", the counts of the off - band frames were scaled so that the counts of ( non saturated ) field stars were the same in on - band and off - band frames .    on - band observations of the spectrophotometric standard stars g191-b2b , pg0934 + 554 , pg0834 + 546 , bd+33 2642 , feige 56 and feige 67 were taken to perform the flux calibration of our objects .",
    "the accuracy of the zero point was 0.05 mag .",
    "the photometry of the on - band and off - band sources was performed with the iraf task qphot , and consisted of circular aperture photometry until convergence of the growth curve was achieved .",
    "both objects , drp - a539a and drp - a634a , appear very compact and much brighter in on - band than in off - band , as shown in figs [ a539 ha ] and [ a634 ha ] .",
    "while drp - a539a appears to be an isolated source , a diffuse low surface brightness structure has been detected extending north east from drp - a634a .",
    "hereafter , the compact source will be referred to as drp - a634a , whereas the diffuse low surface brightness structure will be named lsb - a634a .",
    "some knotty faint h@xmath0 emission can be seen at the northern tip of lsb - a634a , which will be referred to as lsb - a634a_knot .",

    "long slit spectroscopy of drp - a539a , drp - a634a and lsb - a634a was obtained with the alhambra faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) attached to the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) at the orm on 19th november 2004 and 9th december 2004 .",

    "a total of 3@xmath241800  s exposures for each spectral range of drp - a539a were taken with the slit oriented along the parallactic angle .",
    "finally , a 600 s exposure using grism # 8 was performed in order to observe the extended emission of lsb - a634a ; in this case , the slit was centered on drp - a634a and was carefully oriented at an angle of 54@xmath7 ( from north to east ) . due to an increase in the humidity , this exposure was stopped after 600  s. table  [ spectra_log ] shows the log of spectroscopic observations .",
    "data reduction was performed using iraf , following the standard procedure of bias correction , flat - fielding and wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "1-d spectra of drp - a539a and drp - a634a were extracted by adding the flux in the spatial sections along the slit which maximize their signal to noise ratios .",
    "a total of 10 and 7 pixels were added for drp - a539a and drp - a634a respectively .",
    "the same procedure was followed to extract a 1-d spectrum for lsb - a634a . as a consequence of its low surface brightness only a faint emission line , spatially corresponding to lsb - a634a_knot , was obtained after adding a total of 21 pixels .",
    "as indicated below , this emission line was identified as h@xmath0 .",
    "both nights were only partially photometric , so an absolute spectrophotometric flux calibration was not attempted .",
    "however , the spectrophotometric standard star hiltner  600 was observed before and after each object with each grism , thus a relative calibration of the spectra in physical units was performed .",
    "the spectra corresponding to the red grism were scaled to the blue ones by using the continuum level and the flux of the [ hei]@xmath235876  line , present in the blue and red spectra .",

    "given the low continuum shown by both objects , no correction for underlying absorption was performed .",
    "radial velocities were computed from a sigma - weighted average of the redshifts corresponding to the individual emission lines . after applying the heliocentric corrections , values of @xmath31  km  s@xmath9 and @xmath32  km  s@xmath9",
    "were found for drp - a539a and drp - a634a respectively .",

    "figure  [ profiles ] shows the radial profiles of drp - a539a and drp - a634a , derived from our sharpest images .",
    "the first is marginally different from the typical stellar profile , showing a radius at half maximum @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "these effective radii are lower than most values presented for misclassified compact galaxies in the millennium galaxy catalogue @xcite and resemble the values typically shown by ucdgs in nearby clusters @xcite .    as concerns lsb - a634a ,",
    "the length of its major axis from our continuum image was estimated to be @xmath41 . at the distance of drp - a634a this length corresponds to 16  kpc .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the dimensions of edge - on disc galaxies .",
    "the angular size of the system argues against it being a high redshift object . if , for example , the emission line reported in section  2.2 was one of the [ oiii ] lines , the redshift would be @xmath42 , and the corresponding diameter of the system at such a distance would be 138  kpc , which is highly unlikely for an edge - on galaxy .",
    "for the same reason , we can discard the possibility of this system being located at larger distances .",
    "broad band magnitudes can be derived for drp - a634a since sdss frames are available .",

    "the broad band magnitudes of the composite system lsb - a634a@xmath27drp - a634a were also derived , obtaining @xmath45  mag and @xmath46  mag . since drp - a539a",

    "the magnitudes derived for drp - a539a and drp - a634a are brighter than those typical of early - type ucdgs in clusters @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the starburst99 model @xcite predicts that the optical magnitudes of an instantaneous burst of star formation can fade by more than 3 magnitudes in about 10@xmath50 yr .",
    "these results together with the limits to the sizes of drp - a539a and drp - a634a , open the possibility of them being the progenitors of early - type ucdgs recently found in nearby clusters .",
    "the equivalent widths of the most conspicuous balmer emission lines of our two objects are relatively high : ew(h@xmath28 ) ( 77 and 280  for drp - a539a and drp - a634a respectively ) are in fact above the median value ( @xmath51 ) reported for the sample of hii galaxies of @xcite and also for the sample of hi - rich dwarf galaxies in the hydra cluster of @xcite .",
    "in addition , ew(h@xmath52[nii ] ) ( 510 and 1290   respectively ) are several times larger than the corresponding values of star forming dwarf galaxies reported in other clusters such as fornax @xcite , virgo @xcite , coma @xcite and a1367 @xcite .",
    "when comparing with the ucbds of @xcite we find that the equivalent width of drp - a539a is among the typical values of this sample , but drp - a634a remains an extreme case .",
    "the high equivalent widths shown by our two galaxies reveal very strong and young star formation activity . the ages and stellar mass of the recent star formation episodes can be estimated from the luminosities and equivalent widths of the balmer lines . by assuming an instantaneous burst of star formation , and using starburst99 @xcite for a kroupa imf with @xmath53  m@xmath4 and @xmath54  m@xmath4 and the padova agb tracks , we find that the ages predicted are 5.8 and 4.5  myr ( 5 and 4 myr using geneva high tracks ) for drp - a539a and drp - a634a respectively .",
    "the corresponding masses which are being converted into stars are 2.0 and 2.2  10@xmath55m@xmath4 respectively , with an uncertainty of 15% flux and corresponding error ( derreddening error is included ) . ] .",
    "this computation assumes the approximation that all lyman continuum photons are absorbed by the gas .",
    "figure  [ mb_z ] shows the luminosity - metallicity relation for dwarf galaxies ( after @xcite ) , including the points for drp - a539a and drp - a634a , with @xmath56 mag and @xmath57 mag respectively . @xmath58",

    "contours corresponding to the x - ray emission and to the surface density of galaxies ( from 2mass ) of a539 are overlaid .",
    "it can be seen that the maxima of surface density of galaxies and x - ray are coincident .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a539 is 6.7 @xmath61 erg  s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "its velocity dispersion was estimated to be 629  km  s@xmath9 , thus giving a total dynamical mass for the cluster of @xmath62  m@xmath4 ( struble & rood 1999 ) . the projected distance of drp - a539a from the center of a539 is 300  kpc , which corresponds to @xmath63 .",
    "this short distance together with the measured radial velocity of drp - a539a , ensures that this object is well within the region defined by the caustic of the cluster ( see figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of such an active star forming object at such a short distance from the center of a cluster is unusual and opens several questions about its nature and origin .",
    "one possibility is that this object could be a tidal dwarf galaxy , resulting from a galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "these kinds of objects have been previously reported in different environments such as clusters @xcite , groups @xcite or just pairs of interacting galaxies @xcite .",

    "we analyzed the isophotes of this galaxy and did not find any distortion or abnormal twist of the isophotes that could be taken as a signature of interaction .",
    "moreover , no diffuse emission was detected around this galaxy in the direction of drp - a539a .",
    "in addition , as shown in figure  [ mb_z ] , drp - a539a follows the mean luminosity - metallicity relation derived for a large sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "based on these arguments , we can discard drp - a539a as being a tdg .",
    "another possibility is that drp - a539a is the product of icm - induced efficient star formation in gas clouds drifting into the cluster @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the star formation activity results from the compression of molecular clouds stripped from spiral galaxies through galaxy - galaxy or galaxy - tidal field interactions .",
    "isolated intra - cluster hii regions have already been reported in the virgo cluster @xcite . however , these hii regions are more than one order of magnitude less luminous than drp - a539a .",
    "it should be noted that the objects studied in @xcite are located close to the two bright spirals vcc  836 and vcc  873 , which are probably their progenitors .",
    "nonetheless , drp - a539a does not appear to be associated to any gas - rich bright galaxy , suggesting that either the parent molecular cloud is the result of an ancient episode of gas stripping , where the stripped galaxy is already far away , or rather we are facing a star forming dwarf galaxy ( sfdg ) falling for the first time into the cluster core .",
    "theoretical models predict that sfdgs lose their external gas very rapidly when they enter the cluster potential well , due to the ram pressure exerted by the icm @xcite and also , according to @xcite , the timescale for transformation of gas into stars due to icm pressure is of the order of 10  myr ; for this reason we argue that drp - a539a is in the very early stages of the infall process .",

    "the non detection of x - ray emission means that this cluster is probably in the process of formation and therefore a virialized core is not yet in place .",
    "nevertheless , the smoothed surface density contours from 2mass show a dense central aggregate of galaxies showing the galaxy cluster location and shape .",
    "we must note that the cluster center as indicated by the 2mass - contours , @xmath67:@xmath68:@xmath69 , @xmath70:@xmath71:@xmath72 , is about 12 arcmin away from the center quoted in @xcite .",

    "the heliocentric velocity measured for drp - a634a differs from the cluster heliocentric velocity by @xmath73 km  s@xmath9 , and this object is located at a projected distance of 398  kpc from the cluster center .",
    "both values , heliocentric velocity and projected distance , would place drp - a634a within the caustic of every galaxy cluster presented in @xcite , at the @xmath74 confidence level ; especially in the case of a194 , a cluster presenting velocity dispersion and extension in the sky very similar to those of a634 .",
    "the non detection in x - ray of a634 together with the substantial distance of drp - a634a to the cluster center , may weaken the hypothesis that the strong star formation activity shown by this object could be the result of compression of molecular clouds due to the pressure exerted by the icm .",
    "nonetheless , we must bear in mind that the lack of detection of x - ray emission in a634 does not necessarily mean it is devoid of a significant icm .",
    "the comparable radial velocities measured for drp - a634a and lsb - a634a , and their close position in the sky could be indicative of both objects being physically related .",
    "the optical morphology of the lsb - a634a@xmath27drp - a634a system may suggest an edge - on , late - type , low surface brightness galaxy , with an off - center very bright knot accounting for most of the optical light .",
    "in this scenario , would this system be anywhere close to the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation ? to answer this question ,",
    "first we have assumed that the difference between the radial velocities of drp - a634a and lsb - a634a_knot provides an estimation of the internal velocity of the system , giving @xmath75 km  s@xmath9 .",

    "( see their figure  6 ) to our value of @xmath84 , their tf relation predicts @xmath85  mag , nearly 3  mag fainter than the value of @xmath77 estimated above for the whole system . in the optical , several papers on the tf relation for low luminosity galaxies have appeared recently .",
    "the tf relation for local discs and irregular galaxies from @xcite would predict a value of @xmath86 mag for our @xmath87 km  s@xmath9 , about 2 mag fainter than the value measured for our system . according to @xcite ( figure 13 ,",
    "page 117 ) , galaxies with absolute magnitudes fainter than @xmath88 systematically fall below a straight line tf relation .",
    "this fact has been highlighted by @xcite pointing out the different evolutionary stage of gas - rich dwarfs with respect to spiral discs .",
    "more recently @xcite concluded that dwarf galaxies form a distinct sequence , being more diffuse than disc galaxies .",
    "to summarize , the predictions of the tf relation for galaxies with internal velocity of order @xmath87 km  s@xmath9 yield luminosity values much fainter than that determined here for this system . on the other side , as mentioned in sect",
    "3 this integrated system separates from the luminosity - metallicity relation being too luminous for its metallicity . according to these findings",
    ", the object formed by lsb - a634a@xmath27drp - a634a is not proven to be a single galaxy .    even though the lsb - a634a@xmath27drp - a634a system is not likely to be a single galaxy , still both objects could be physically related . under this assumption , we propose that the strong star formation activity shown by drp - a634a is the result of the encounter between these objects .",
    "in fact , examples of recent star formation bursts associated to small groups of galaxies which are falling into a cluster have already been reported in the literature @xcite , and are thought to be associated to the so - called preprocessing of galaxies before entering the cluster environment .",
    "this mechanism could account for a non negligible fraction of the evolution of galaxies in dense environments .",
    "further observations of this intriguing system are needed in order to fully understand its nature and evolutionary state .",
    "we have reported two examples of extreme star forming objects in nearby clusters with different properties and at different evolutionary phases .",
    "the observations show that albeit they do not share the same origin , both compact and young starbursts show a very intense star formation activity , even when compared to similar objects in other nearby clusters or in less dense environments .",
    "the origin of the two starbursts reported in this paper are probably associated to different physical mechanisms : drp - a539a is directly associated to the dense and hot icm which compresses intergalactic clouds and induces star formation episodes in a short timescale , before ram pressure is able to sweep the external gas .",
    "the case of drp - a634a can be related to the so - called `` preprocessing '' of galaxies before they enter the cluster environment . in this case , the aggregates of galaxies whose final fate is to fall into the cluster inner regions , are the environments where secondary evolution is taking place .",
    "two questions arise from these considerations : what is the relative importance of such compact and extreme starbursts with respect to the global sfr of nearby clusters ? and",
    ", is there any evolutionary link between them and the early - type ultracompact dwarf galaxies already reported in the literature ?",
    "@xcite to answer the first question , a detailed search based on h@xmath0 surveys is required .",
    "we note that an extensive spectroscopic survey of abell 539 devoted to studying the star formation in cluster galaxies has been carried out by @xcite , but drp - a539a was not selected there because their sample of galaxies was nir - magnitude limited .",
    "the same would have happened with drp - a634a if the cluster a634 had been surveyed under the same conditions .",
    "these non detections are naturally explained by the fact that these objects are dwarfs and very young .",
    "however , they show up very easily in wide field h@xmath0 imaging surveys despite their size and small stellar content . these kinds of surveys are required to carry out a detailed census of compact starbursts in clusters of galaxies . in this way ,",
    "their relative contribution to the total sfr budget of nearby clusters will definitely be determined . as concerns the second question , several explanations have already been proposed for the origin of ucdgs ( see @xcite for an interesting review ) , although the discussion remains open .",
    "we propose that compact and strong starbursts like the ones presented in this paper could evolve to early - type dwarf galaxies after cessation of star formation and , if stripping is efficient as the galaxy approaches the innermost regions of the cluster , become ucdgs like the ones reported in virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "a complete census of compact starbursts in clusters , with accurate projected positions and surface densities will also help to answer this question .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her useful comments and suggestions .",
    "we also want to thank steve donegan for his careful revision of the english expression in this paper .",
