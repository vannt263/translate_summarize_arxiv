    "we shall study the ground - state phase diagram of this system using the grand - canonical formalism , i.e. we consider @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the chemical potentials of electrons and ions , respectively .",

    "particle transformation for electrons , i.e. @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is equal to @xmath17 on the even sublattice , and @xmath19 on the odd one ) , and the hole  particle transformation for ions , one finds that if @xmath40 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath55 , then @xmath56 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath57 .",

    "<S> we consider the model of strongly - correlated system of electrons described by an extended falicov  kimball hamiltonian where the stability of some axial and diagonal striped phases was proved . </S>",
    "<S> introducing a next - nearest - neighbor hopping , small enough not to destroy the striped structure , we examine rigorously how the presence of the next - nearest - neighbor hopping anisotropy reduces the @xmath0-rotation degeneracy of the diagonal - striped phase . </S>",
    "<S> the effect appears to be similar to that in the case of anisotropy of the nearest - neighbor hopping : the stripes are oriented in the direction of the weaker next - nearest - neighbor hopping . </S>"
