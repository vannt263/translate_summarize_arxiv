    "recently , an intriguing possibility was suggested by raghavan @xcite that the resonant absorption reaction @xcite @xmath6 with simultaneous capture of an atomic orbital electron can be dramatically enhanced .",
    "the key idea is to use monochromatic @xmath7 beam with the energy 18.6 kev from the inverse reaction @xmath8@xmath9 , by which the resonance condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "( see @xcite for earlier suggestions . )",
    "he then suggested an experiment to measure @xmath1 by utilizing the ultra low - energy monochromatic @xmath7 beam .",
    "though similar to the reactor @xmath1 experiments @xcite , the typical baseline length is of order 10 m due to much lower energy of the beam by a factor of @xmath10150 , making it doable in the laboratories .",
    "the mechanism , in principle , would work with more generic setting in which @xmath11 and @xmath12 in ( [ res - abs ] ) are replaced by nuclei a(z ) and a(z-1 ) .",
    "the author of ref .",
    "@xcite then went on to even more aggressive proposal of enhancement by a factor of @xmath13 by embedding both @xmath11 and @xmath12 into solids @xcite by which the broadening of the beam due to nuclear recoil is severely suppressed by a mechanism similar to the mssbauer effect @xcite .",
    "then , the event rate of the @xmath1 experiment is enhanced by the same factor , allowing extremely high counting rate .",
    "thanks to the ultimate energy resolution of @xmath14 enabled by the recoilless mechanism , he was able to propose a table top experiment to measure gravitational red shift of neutrinos , a neutrino analogue of the pound - rebka experiment for photons @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we examine possible physics potentials of the @xmath1 experiment proposed in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the experiment , which clearly marks the difference from the reactor @xmath1 measurement , is the use of monochromatic beam apart from the shorter baseline by a factor of @xmath10150 .",
    "then , the most interesting question is how accurately @xmath0 can be determined .",
    "note that even without recoilless setting , the beam energy width is of the order of @xmath15 , and it can be ignored for all practical purposes .",
    "it is also interesting to explore the accuracy of @xmath1 measurement .",
    "in addition to possible extremely high statistics , the baseline as short as @xmath1610 m should allow us to utilize the setting of continuously movable detector , the one which once proposed in a reactor @xmath1 experiment @xcite but the one that did not survive in the ( semi- ) final proposal .",
    "the method will greatly help to reduce the experimental systematic uncertainties of the measurement .",
    "we will show in our analysis that the accuracies one can achieve for @xmath0 and @xmath1 determination by the recoilless resonant absorption are enormous . at @xmath3 , for example , the fractional uncertainty in @xmath0 determination is 0.6% ( 2.4% ) and the uncertainty of @xmath2 is 0.002 ( 0.008 ) both at 1@xmath4 cl under an optimistic ( pessimistic ) assumption of systematic error of 0.2% ( 1% ) .    what is the scientific merit of such precision measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ? with a 1% level precision of @xmath0 , the method for determining neutrino mass hierarchy by comparing between the two effective @xmath17 measured in reactor and accelerator ( or atmospheric ) disappearance measurement @xcite would work , opening another door for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "it is also proposed @xcite that the @xmath5 octant degeneracy can be resolved by combining reactor measurement of @xmath1 with accelerator disappearance ( appearance ) measurement of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath20 , for a given set of measurement of @xmath21 disappearance , @xmath22 and @xmath23 appearance probabilities , and the octant ambiguity of @xmath5 is among them .",
    "the nature of the degeneracy may be characterized as the intrinsic degeneracy of @xmath1 and @xmath20 @xcite , which is duplicated by the unknown sign of @xmath0 @xcite and the octant ambiguity of @xmath5 for a given @xmath24 @xcite . for an overview ,",
    "see e.g. , @xcite . ]",
    "( see @xcite for earlier qualitative suggestions . )",
    "the results of the recent quantitative analysis @xcite , however , indicate that the resolving power of the method is limited at small @xmath1 primarily because of the uncertainties in reactor measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the highly accurate measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which is enabled by using the resonant absorption reaction should help resolving the mass hierarchy and the @xmath5 degeneracies .    in sec .",
    "[ concept ] , we discuss `` conceptual design '' of the possible experiments . in sec .  [ method ] , we define the statistical method for our analysis . in sec .",

    "we give preliminary discussions on which kind of setting is likely to be the best one for experiment to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 with use of ultra low - energy monochromatic @xmath7 beam . in this section ,",
    "we rely on the one - mass scale dominant @xcite ( or the two - flavor ) approximation of the neutrino oscillation probability @xmath25 , though we use the full three - flavor expression in our quantitative analysis performed in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] .",
    "it reads @xmath26 where the neutrino mass squared difference is defined as @xmath27 with neutrino masses @xmath28 ( @xmath29 = 1 - 3 ) measured in @xmath23 disappearance and @xmath21 disappearance channels , one has to be careful about the definition of @xmath17 which enter into the survival probabilities @xcite . while keeping this point in mind",
    ", we do not try to elaborate the expressions of @xmath17 in this paper by just writing it as @xmath0 in @xmath23 disappearance channel which may be interpreted as @xmath30 in @xcite . ] and @xmath31 is a distance from a source to a detector . with @xmath32 kev , the first oscillation maximum ( minimum in @xmath25 )",
    "is reached at the baseline distance @xmath33 while the current value of @xmath0 which comes from the atmospheric @xcite and the accelerator @xcite measurement has large uncertainties , it should be possible to narrow down the value thanks to the ongoing and the forthcoming disappearance measurement by minos @xcite and t2k @xcite experiments .",
    "furthermore , the experiment considered in this paper is powerful enough to determine both quantities accurately at the same time , if detector locations are appropriately chosen .",
    "the whole discussion of the @xmath1 experiment must be preceded by the test measurement at @xmath1610 cm or so to verify the principle , namely to demonstrate that the mechanism of resonant enhancement proposed in @xcite is indeed at work . at the same time , the flux times cross section must be measured to check the consistency of the monte carlo estimate .",
    "then , one can go on to the measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and possibly other quantities .",
    "because of the expected high statistics of the experiment it is natural to think about using spectrum informations",
    ". in the case of monochromatic beam it amounts to consider measurement at several different detector locations .",
    "let us estimate the event rate .",
    "although the precise rate is hard to estimate , the numbers displayed below will give the readers a feeling on what would be the time scale for the experiment .",
    "the @xmath7 flux from @xmath34h source with strength @xmath35 mci due to bound state beta decay is given by @xmath36 where the ratio of bound state beta decay to free space decay is taken to be @xmath37 based on @xcite .",
    "the rate of the resonant absorption reaction can be computed by using cross section @xmath38 and number of target atoms @xmath39 as @xmath40 . without the mssbauer enhancement",
    "the cross section is estimated to be @xmath41 @xcite based on @xcite .",
    "then , the rate with target mass @xmath42 without neutrino oscillation is given by @xmath43 an improved estimate in @xcite entailed a factor of @xmath44 enhancement of the cross section by the mssbauer effect after the source and the target are embedded into solids . assuming the enhancement factor , @xmath45 and the rate becomes @xmath46 therefore , one obtains about @xmath47 events per day for 1 mci source and 100 g @xmath34he target at a baseline distance @xmath48 m. if the enhancement factor is not reached the running time for collecting the same number of events becomes longer accordingly .",
    "thus , once the @xmath34he ( and much easier @xmath34h ) implementation into solid is achieved , the event rate is sufficient .",
    "the real issue for high sensitivity measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath2 is whether the produced @xmath34h can be counted directly without waiting for decaying back to @xmath34he by emitting electron .",
    "it is because the long lifetime of 12.33 year @xcite of @xmath34h makes it impossible to identify which period the decayed @xmath34h was produced , resulting in the errors of the event rate in each detector location .",
    "possibilities of real - time counting and direct counting by extracting @xmath34h atoms are mentioned in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we assume that at least one of such methods works , and it offers opportunity of direct counting of events . note that the detection efficiency need not to be high because of huge number of events . what is important is the time - stable counting rate which allows relative systematic errors between measurement at different detector locations small enough .",
    "in this section , we define the statistical procedure for our analysis to estimate the sensitivities of @xmath0 and @xmath2 to be carried out in the following sections",
    ". we aim at illuminating general properties of the @xmath49 under the assumption of the small uncorrelated systematic errors compared to the correlated ones .",
    "we consider measurement at @xmath50 different distances @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) from the source .",
    "then , the appropriate form of @xmath53 which is suited for analytic study @xcite and is simply denoted as @xmath49 hereafter , is as follows : @xmath54 ^ 2}{n^{exp}_{i } + ( \\sigma_{usys , i } n^{exp}_{i})^2 }   +   \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_{c } } \\right)^2   \\label{chi2_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the number of events computed with the values of parameters given by nature , and @xmath56 is the one computed with certain trial set of parameters .",
    "@xmath57 is the systematic error common to measurement at @xmath50 different distances , the correlated error , whereas @xmath58 indicate errors that can not be attributed to @xmath57 , the uncorrelated errors .",
    "the example of the former and the latter errors are as follows :    * @xmath57 ( correlated error ) : uncertainties in number of target @xmath34he atoms , errors in counting the number of produced tritium nuclei , errors in calculating resonant absorption cross section , errors in estimating the efficiency of counting tritium nuclei * @xmath58 ( uncorrelated error ) : possible time dependences of number of decaying tritium nuclei and detection efficiency of events    since we consider moving detector setting the list of the thinkable uncorrelated systematic errors is quite limited .",
    "if the near detector with the identical structure with a movable far detector exists the error can , in principle , be vanishingly small .",
    "one may think of the errors of the order of 0.1%-0.3% .",
    "it is because the flux times cross section can be monitored in real time by a near detector .",
    "in fact , the similar values for uncorrelated systematic error are adopted in sensitivity estimate of some of the reactor @xmath1 experiments such as the braidwood , the daya bay , and the angra projects @xcite . in near future experiments ,",
    "somewhat larger values are taken , 0.6% in double - chooz project @xcite and 0.35% in kaska @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it may not be so easy to control the correlated systematic error @xmath57 .",
    "the number of @xmath34h nuclei may be measured when they are implemented into solid . the number of target nuclei times the resonant absorption cross section may be measured in a research and development stage with a near detector .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the largest error may come from uncertainty in counting rate of the produced @xmath34h nuclei .",
    "of course , reliable estimate of systematic errors @xmath57 and @xmath59 requires specification of the site to estimate the background caused by n@xmath34h reaction etc .",
    "but , it can be experimentally measured by the source on and off procedure , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "lacking definitive numbers for @xmath57 at the moment , we use a tentative value @xmath60% throughout our analysis .",
    "we have checked that the results barely change even if we use more conservative number @xmath61% .",
    "if the direct counting of @xmath34h atoms does not work , we may have to expect much larger systematic errors , because one has to extract event rate at each detector location only by fitting the decay curve . in this case ,",
    "determination of baseline dependent event rates would be more and more difficult for larger number of detector locations .",
    "probably , the better strategy without the direct counting would be to place multiple identical detectors ( or of the same structure ) at appropriate baseline distances . even in this case",
    ", it is quite possible that the uncorrelated systematic error @xmath59 can be controlled to 1% level , as expected in a variety of reactor @xmath1 experiments @xcite .      by eliminating @xmath62 through minimization",
    "the @xmath49 can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is defined as @xmath65 .",

    ", the @xmath49 depends upon @xmath58 and @xmath69 only through this combination .",
    "therefore , the particular case that will be taken in the next section , in fact , includes many cases with different event number but with the same @xmath70 .    under the approximation @xmath71 , @xmath66 simplifies ; @xmath72 the remarkable feature of ( [ vinv_corrdom ] ) is the `` scaling behavior '' in which @xmath49 is independent of the correlated error @xmath57 , and the sensitivity to @xmath73 and @xmath0 can be made higher as the uncorrelated systematic errors as well as the statistical error become smaller .",
    "it may be counterintuitive because the leading term of the error matrix @xmath74 is of order @xmath75 .",
    "( see appendix [ appendix1 ] . )",
    "it is due to the singular nature of the leading order matrix , as noted in @xcite .",
    "we now examine the sensitivities of @xmath0 and @xmath2 achievable by the recoilless resonant absorption of monochromatic @xmath23 enhanced by the mssbauer effect .",
    "the numerical estimate of the sensitivities in this section will be followed by the one by the analytic method in sec .",
    "[ analytic ] .",
    "the setting of movable detector and the expected high statistics of the experiment make it possible to consider the situation that an equal number of events are taken in each detector location .",
    "of course , the far a detector from the source , the longer an exposure will take . in the following analysis ,",
    "the number of events are assumed to be @xmath76 in each detector location . given the rate in ( [ enhancedr ] ) , and assuming that the direct counting works , it is obtainable in @xmath1610 days for 100 g @xmath34he target even if the detector is located at the second oscillation maximum , @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of events @xmath76 is sufficient for our purpose because it is unlikely that the uncorrelated systematic errors can be made much smaller than 0.1% .",
    "we take a `` common - sense approach '' to determine the locations of the detectors and postpone the discussion of the optimization problem .",

    "we have confined ourselves to the problem of optimal setting of distances under the constraint of equal number of events at each location . to minimize running time for a given sensitivity , we have to address the problem of optimal detector locations and exposure times for a given total running time .",

    "<S> we discuss , in the context of precision measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , physics capabilities enabled by the recoilless resonant absorption of monochromatic antineutrino beam enhanced by the mssbauer effect recently proposed by raghavan . under the assumption of small relative systematic error of a few tenth of percent level between measurement at different detector locations , </S>",
    "<S> we give analytical and numerical estimates of the sensitivities to @xmath0 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracies of determination of them are enormous ; the fractional uncertainty in @xmath0 achievable by 10 point measurement is 0.6% ( 2.4% ) for @xmath3 , and the uncertainty of @xmath2 is 0.002 ( 0.008 ) both at 1@xmath4 cl with the optimistic ( pessimistic ) assumption of systematic error of 0.2% ( 1% ) . the former opens a new possibility of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by comparing the measured value of @xmath0 with the one by accelerator experiments , while the latter will help resolving the @xmath5 octant degeneracy .    </S>",
