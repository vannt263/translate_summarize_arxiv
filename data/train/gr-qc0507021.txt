    "however , the most significant advantage of the form ( [ hongteometric ] ) is that the range of @xmath81 is bounded by roots which correspond to @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and this ensures that closed timelike lines do not appear near the conical singularities on the axis  a property that is usually associated with a non - zero value of the nut parameter .",
    "this confirms that the correct `` spinning @xmath0-metric '' without any nut - like behaviour occurs when @xmath98 ( i.e. @xmath137 ) as argued by hong and teo @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also obtain in this case that @xmath148 so that the deficit angle of the string pulling the black holes toward infinity , or the excess angle of the strut between them , is obtained immediately using ( [ def0 ] ) or ( [ defpi ] ) respectively .",
    "let us now consider the complementary case with no kerr - like rotation in which @xmath102 , but @xmath1 remains non - zero . in this case @xmath120 and @xmath121 vanish , and we can use the scalings ( [ scaling ] ) to set the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that @xmath75 and @xmath149 . the remaining freedom",
    "can then be used to set @xmath150 , and ( [ epsilon ] ) and ( [ n ] ) become @xmath151    n= l\\,\\big(-k+\\alpha m -\\alpha^2(e^2+g^2+kl^2)\\big ) ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 for the general case in which @xmath153 , this yields a fairly complicated relation between the parameter @xmath2 and the nut parameter  @xmath1 .",
    "we now have @xmath154 , and the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) becomes @xmath155 where @xmath156 the only non - zero components of the curvature tensor are given by @xmath157   { \\displaystyle \\phi_{11}= { 1\\over2}\\,(e^2+g^2)\\,{(1-\\alpha r)^4\\over(r^2+l^2)^2 } , }    \\end{array}\\ ] ] from which it can be seen that there are no curvature singularities provided @xmath125 , and we may generally take @xmath110 as defined above .    the metric ( [ a=0metric ] ) appears to contain the arbitrary parameter @xmath17 .",
    "for the case in which @xmath53 , we obtain @xmath158 and   @xmath159 .",
    "this is precisely the ( charged ) nut metric @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to initially interpret the metric ( [ a=0metric ] ) as a general accelerating nut solution .",
    "however , this is not the correct interpretation for this particular case .",
    "it may first be observed that the deficit angles vanish on the entire axis  @xmath160  in this case in which @xmath161 ; i.e. there is nothing to `` cause '' an acceleration .",
    "more specifically , the transformation @xmath162 alters the metric ( [ a=0metric ] ) to the form @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 this is exactly the charged nut solution ( when @xmath166 , it is the usual form of the reissner ",
    "nordstrm metric ) .",
    "but the familiar mass parameter is now @xmath167 , and this is related by equation ( [ mm ] ) to the plebaski  demiaski parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the parameters @xmath168 and @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the nut parameter is now given by @xmath168 , and this is related to @xmath17 and @xmath1 as in ( [ a=0trans ] ) and hence to the plebaski ",
    "demiaski parameter @xmath2 which is given by ( [ n ] ) .",
    "it may also be observed that , in the above transformation , @xmath169 so that @xmath145 corresponds to spacelike infinity in the line element ( [ a=0metric ] ) .",
    "but , particularly , it must be concluded that @xmath17 is a redundant parameter in the metric ( [ a=0metric ] ) that can be removed by the above transformation for this case in which @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the metric ( [ a=0metric ] ) does not represent a new `` accelerating '' nut solution .",
    "on the other hand , the general metric ( [ newmetric ] ) does represent a pair of accelerating sources with a non - zero nut parameter since it does explicitly contain the @xmath0-metric . and , just as the accelerating and rotating solution with no nut features is obtained by putting and not @xmath170 , so it may be appropriate to look for an accelerating nut solution with no rotational features by considering some non - zero value of @xmath55 rather than putting @xmath161",
    ". however , such a solution has to date neither been identified nor proved not to exist .",
    "we have presented , in a most convenient form , the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) which explicitly represents the complete family of accelerating and rotating black holes with a generally non - zero mass , charge ( electric and magnetic ) and nut parameter .",
    "the general structure of this family of solutions is indicated in figure  1 .",
    "the metric has been obtained after first re - expressing the plebaski ",
    "demiaski metric in a more convenient form which explicitly includes the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which respectively represent the acceleration of the sources and the twist of the repeated principal null congruences ( and hence the rotation of the sources and/or the effects of the nut parameter ) .",
    "the form ( [ newmetric ] ) excludes the cases of the plebaski ",
    "demiaski solution for which the spacelike 2-surfaces spanned by @xmath35 and @xmath49 have zero or negative curvature , as these do not represent black hole - like solutions in any limit .    in presenting this form of the metric",
    ", we have clarified the physical meaning of the arbitrary parameters involved . as can be seen from the maxwell field components ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are unambiguously the electric and magnetic charges of the sources .",
    "the twist of the repeated principal null congruences is proportional to the parameter @xmath18 , and this is related to both the kerr - like rotation parameter @xmath55 and the nut parameter @xmath1 .",
    "provided @xmath171 , @xmath17 is the acceleration of the sources . in particular",
    ", we have found an explicit relationship between the parameter @xmath1 and the plebaski ",
    "demiaski parameter @xmath2 given in ( [ n ] ) .",
    "however , the nut parameter is only identified as @xmath1 for the non - accelerating case in which @xmath53 . when @xmath153 , it may be more appropriately taken as @xmath168 which is related to @xmath1 by ( [ a=0trans ] ) .",
    "but even this is only valid when @xmath161 .",
    "thus the all - encompassing physical representation of the nut parameter when @xmath17 and @xmath55 are both non - zero , is still to be determined .",
    "it is also difficult to physically determine the `` correct '' mass parameter . when @xmath170 , the gravitational strength of the singularity is proportional to @xmath21 , but otherwise it is proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "however , when @xmath91 , the space - time is nonsingular and the `` mass '' of the source is only determined in certain limits . when @xmath53 , @xmath21 is still the familiar mass parameter of the kerr ",
    "nut metric .",
    "however , when @xmath161 , the usual mass parameter of the charged @xmath0-metric is @xmath167 , which given by ( [ mm ] ) .",
    "thus , as for the nut parameter , the physically significant mass parameter is still to be determined when @xmath17 , @xmath168 and @xmath55 are all non - zero .",
