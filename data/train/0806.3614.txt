    "@xcite a perfect detector of the qubit state should perform projective measurement , @xcite which means that it should have two possible outcomes : 0 and 1 ( corresponding to the qubit states @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , the probabilities of these outcomes should be equal to the corresponding matrix elements of the qubit s density matrix ( traced over other entangled qubits ) , and after the measurement the pre - measured quantum state should get projected onto the subspace , corresponding to the measurement result .",
    "realistic detectors of course do not realize the perfect projective measurement . in this paper",
    "we discuss efficiency of a realistic detector , assuming for simplicity the measurement of only one qubit ; in other words , we neglect physical coupling with other entangled qubits in the process of measurement , so that the many - qubit measurement problem can be reduced to the one - qubit measurement .    we will consider a detector with binary outcome : 0 or 1 ( such detector can also be called a dichotomic or threshold detector ) . in a realistic case",
    "the outcome does not perfectly correspond to the qubit state .",
    "for example , for a qubit in the state @xmath0 the probability @xmath2 of the result 0 is typically less than 100% ( we will call @xmath2 a `` measurement fidelity '' for the state @xmath0 ) . similarly , for a qubit in the state @xmath1 the probability @xmath3 to get result 1 is usually also less than unity .",
    "( the fidelities @xmath2 and @xmath3 fully determine the outcome probabilities for a general qubit state because of the linearity of the quantum mechanics . ) in such situation the measurement is surely non - projective , and the post - measurement state should be analyzed using a more general formalism . in this paper",
    "we discuss the quantum efficiency ( ideality ) of binary - outcome detectors , which is defined via decoherence of the post - measurement state .",
    "we emphasize that the quantum efficiency is _ not _ related to the measurement fidelities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and therefore is not directly related to the fidelity of a quantum computer read - out .",
    "however , quantum efficiency is an important characteristic of a detector with imperfect fidelity , because for example , quantum - efficient detectors can be used for implementation of non - unitary quantum gates,@xcite quantum feedback,@xcite quantum uncollapsing,@xcite etc .",
    "quantum efficiency ( ideality ) of solid - state qubit detectors has been well studied for linear detectors .",
    "@xcite in this case it has been defined @xcite as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the qubit ensemble decoherence rate due to measurement and @xmath6 is the so - called `` measurement time '' : @xcite the time after which the signal - to - noise ratio becomes equal to unity .",
    "notice that the inequality @xmath7 ( leading to the bound @xmath8 ) can be easily derived @xcite from the classical bayes formula and inequality @xmath9 for the matrix elements of the qubit density matrix @xmath10 ( this derivation is within the framework of the quantum bayesian theory @xcite describing individual realizations of measurement ) ; it has been also derived using the framework of the ensemble - averaged theory of linear quantum detectors .",
    "@xcite it is important to mention that an equivalent definition of the quantum - limited linear detector has been discussed more than two decades ago @xcite in terms of the ratio between the effective energy sensitivity and @xmath11 . in a simple model , @xcite the detector nonideality ( @xmath12 ) can be caused by an additional coupling of the qubit with dephasing environment which increases the back - action noise , or by additional output noise ( i.e.  amplifier noise ) , or by both contributions . correspondingly , the detector efficiency @xmath13 can be interpreted as a ratio @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the `` informational '' limit on decoherence , determined by a given rate of information acquisition , or as a ratio @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the maximum possible rate of information acquisition for a given value of back - action strength @xmath5 .",
    "particular interpretation as well as the real physical reason of the nonideality are irrelevant from the point of view of qubit measurement .",
    "an ideal linear quantum detector ( @xmath18 ) causes no decoherence of the measured qubit in each realization of the measurement ( i.e.  for each measurement outcome ) in the sense that initially pure qubit state remains pure in the process of measurement ; an example of such detector is the quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "@xcite moreover , a detector with @xmath18 should not introduce any change of the phase between amplitudes of the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , except due to possible constant shift of energy difference between the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the proof of the last statement is rather simple:@xcite if the phase change would depend on the detector outcome , then averaging over the outcomes would lead to strict inequality latexmath:[$|\\langle",
    "\\rho_{01}\\rangle | < \\langle    however , there is a class of linear detectors , for which the qubit state does not decohere for any measurement outcome , but nevertheless there is an outcome - dependent phase shift between the states @xmath0 and @xmath1.@xcite an example is an asymmetric qpc : in this case each electron passing through the qpc shifts the phase between the qubit states by a small constant.@xcite for such detectors@xcite @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the output noise and @xmath22 is the properly normalized factor @xcite describing the correlation between the output and back - action noises .",
    "such detectors are non - ideal by the above definition ( @xmath12 ) ; however , they are ideal in another sense : for example , they still can be used for perfect quantum feedback , quantum uncollapsing , etc .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to introduce a different definition of the quantum efficiency which takes into account noise correlation @xmath22 , for example , as@xcite @xmath23 or as @xmath24 ( here we exchanged the definitions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 compared to refs . ) .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss various definitions of quantum efficiency for binary - outcome detectors , using the reviewed above methodology developed for the linear detectors .",
    "we start with discussion of an arbitrary binary - oucome detector and show that in general its quantum efficiency can be described by 18 parameters , that is surely impractical .",
    "then we focus on the class of detectors , which do not affect qubit in the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( we call them quantum non - demolition@xcite ( qnd ) detectors ) .",
    "quantum efficiency of the qnd detectors can be described by only 2 parameters .",
    "we introduce several definitions of quantum efficiency for the qnd detectors and calculate the quantum efficiencies for several detector models .",
    "let us start with the general description of the binary - outcome measurement of a qubit , using the povm ( `` positive operator - valued measure '' ) theory of measurement.@xcite for an ideal detector ( which transforms a pure qubit state into a pure state ) the measurement can be described by two linear operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 , corresponding to two measurement results 0 and 1 . for the qubit with initial density matrix @xmath10",
    "the probability of the result 0 is @xmath29 and the normalized post - measurement state for this result is @xmath30 [ quite often the non - normalized post - measurement state @xmath31 is considered in order to preserve the linearity of transformation ] .",
    "similarly , the probability of the result 1 is @xmath32 and then the post - measurement state is @xmath33 .",
    "the measurement operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 should obey the following conditions:@xcite the hermitian operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 should be positive ( i.e.  having only non - negative eigenvalues ) and satisfy the completeness relation @xmath36 .",
    "( the projective measurement is a special case in which @xmath27 and @xmath28 are projectors onto mutually orthogonal axes . )",
    "let us count the number of degrees of freedom ( real parameters ) describing such an ideal binary - outcome detector .",
    "a linear operator @xmath27 acting in complex two - dimensional space can be described by 4 complex numbers , i.e.  8 real parameters ; however , one parameter is the overall phase , so that there are 7 physical parameters .",
    "similarly , operator @xmath28 can be described by 7 parameters .",
    "the completeless relation gives 4 equations ( two for diagonal elements and two for the complex off - diagonal element ) .",
    "therefore , the measurement by an ideal binary - outcome detector can be described by 10 real parameters ( which include , in particular , fidelities @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "a general ( non - ideal ) binary - outcome detector can be thought of as an ideal detector with many possible outcome values , which however are unknown to us , so that we know only if the outcome value belongs to the group 0 or group 1 ( this trick can obviously describe information loss in an environment ) .",
    "then the measurement can be described by two groups of measurement operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 with an extra index @xmath39 numbering operators within each group .",
    "the probability of the result 0 in this case is @xmath40 and the corresponding post - measurement density matrix is @xmath41 .",
    "similar formulas can be written in the case of result 1 .",
    "the completeness relation in this case is @xmath42 .",
    "since separation into measurement operators within each group is not unique , it is better to deal with linear superoperators @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( a superoperator transforms an operator into an operator , i.e.  a matrix into a matrix ) defined as @xmath45=\\sum_k m^{(0)}_k\\rho m^{(0)\\dagger}_k$ ] and @xmath46=\\sum_k m^{(1)}_k\\rho m^{(1)\\dagger}_k$ ] . in this language",

    "now let us count the number of parameters describing a general ( non - ideal ) binary - outcome measurement of a qubit .",
    "following the methodology of the quantum process tomography,@xcite we can characterize the superoperator @xmath43 by the result of its operation on the state @xmath0 ( 4 parameters , since the resulting density matrix is non - normalized ) , the state @xmath1 ( 4 more parameters ) , and operation on the non - physical density matrix , for which one off - diagonal element is unity , while all other elements are zero ( this gives 8 more parameters , since resulting matrix is not hermitian ) .",
    "overall this gives 16 parameters for @xmath43 and similarly 16 parameters for @xmath44 .",
    "the completeness relation gives 4 equations , therefore the total number of remaining parameters is 28 .    comparing this number with 10 parameters for an ideal detector",
    ", we see that quantum efficiency ( or non - ideality ) of a general binary - outcome qubit detector should be described by 18 parameters .",
    "this is surely impractical , and below we limit our discussion by a narrower subclass of detectors , which can be described by a more reasonable number of parameters .",
    "a general description of a detector attempted above does not make any assumptions regarding the mechanism of measurement and is based only on the linearity of the quantum mechanics . in particular , this approach allows evolution of the qubit by its own in the process of measurement ( e.g.  hamiltonian evolution or energy relaxation ) .",
    "let us now make a restrictive assumption that the qubit can not not evolve by itself in the process of measurement .",
    "in particular , we assume absence of coupling ( infinite barrier ) between the measured states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , so that coupling with the detector can only affect the energy difference between states @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( in other words , we assume only @xmath48-type coupling ) . in this case",
    "the qubit initially in the state @xmath0 necessarily remains in the state @xmath0 after the measurement .",
    "similarly , the qubit in the state @xmath1 can not evolve also .",
    "such a detector is often called a qnd detector ( the author does not quite like this terminology because it somewhat differs from the original meaning of the quantum non - demolition,@xcite but it will still be used here because of absence of a better well - accepted terminology ) .",
    "first , let us consider an ideal qnd detector , which transforms a pure qubit state into a pure state .",
    "in the framework of the methodology discussed in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we can characterize such detector in the following way . in the case of result 0 the initial qubit state @xmath49 ( here @xmath50 ) is transformed into the non - normalized state @xmath51 ( normalization is trivial ) , while in the case of the result 1 it is transformed into @xmath52 .",
    "the probabilities of these results are , correspondingly , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so that the measurement fidelities are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the completeness relation requires total probability of unity for any initial state : @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are real numbers .",
    "overall , we have 4 parameters to characterize an ideal qnd detector : two fidelities ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and two phases ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , so that in the case of result 0 the wavefunction is transformed as @xmath62 while in the case of result 1 the transformation is @xmath63 where @xmath64    a non - ideal qnd detector in general transforms a pure state into a mixed state . because of the linearity of superoperators @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the formalism discussed above , the only possible modification of eqs .",
    "( [ transf0 ] ) and ( [ transf1 ] ) is an extra decoherence between the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
