    "the modeling of spiral galaxies to match photometric and dynamical measurements is a time - honoured endeavor .",
    "a complete and accurate characterization of the structural and kinematical properties of galaxies is necessary to understand the diversity of galactic dynamical behaviour and the origin of galaxies in the current cosmological paradigm .",
    "this paper presents a new set of models for the phase - space distribution functions ( dfs ) of axisymmetric disk galaxies .",
    "the models consist of an exponential disk , a hernquist model bulge @xcite , an nfw halo @xcite , and a central , supermassive black hole .",
    "they are defined by a large number of parameters which permit detailed modeling of real galaxies by fitting to observational constraints .",
    "though the models represent self - consistent equilibrium solutions to the coupled poisson and collisionless boltzmann ( cb ) equations , they are subject to both local and global nonaxisymmetric instabilities and are therefore suitable as initial conditions for numerical studies of galactic dynamics .    the standard practice in modeling disk galaxies has been to assume simple functional forms for the space density and gravitational potential of the disk , bulge , and halo and then fit to a wide range of observational data . for the milky way galaxy ,",
    "optimal structural parameters for these `` mass models '' are found primarily from surface brightness photometry , local stellar kinematics , the circular rotation curve , and observations of dynamical tracer populations such as globular clusters , the magellanic clouds and the dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "these observational constraints have been used to determine the best - fit model parameters based on @xmath0-minimization techniques .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite . )    for external galaxies , the problem is somewhat simpler because of the advantage of an outside view and the smaller number of observational constraints .",
    "optical and infrared de - projected surface brightness profiles of the stellar distribution are combined with rotation curves measured from hi gas kinematics to build mass models .",
    "the standard method is to perform a bulge - disk decomposition of the surface brightness profile usually into an @xmath1-law surface density profile for the bulge and a radial exponential profile for the disk .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein for a discussion of bulge - disk decomposition with the more general srsic law for the bulge . )",
    "the halo model parameters are inferred by fitting multi - component mass models to the rotation curve data assuming values for the mass - to - light ratios of the disk and bulge stars . for nearby galaxies such as m31 ,",
    "kinematic data for the globular cluster , planetary nebulae and satellite systems are used to refine the models @xcite",
    ".    there has also been parallel work in developing realistic n - body realizations of galaxy models for numerical experimentation in disk stability and galaxy interactions and mergers . to generate an n - body realization ,",
    "it is necessary to model the full dfs for the multi - component system , in principle by solving the coupled poisson and cb equations .",
    "owing to the complexity of these equations , various approximation schemes have been used . early work on disk galaxy simulations set up initial conditions by estimating the velocity dispersion for a stable disk model with toomre parameter @xmath2 and then assuming a locally gaussian distribution for the velocities ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite built 3-component models by adiabatically growing a disk potential within a live halo model and then adding an n - body disk with initial conditions generated as above .",
    "@xcite presented a simpler approximate presciption for 3-component disk - bulge - halo models where the bulge and halo velocity distributions are assumed to be maxwellian , truncated at the local escape speed and with dispersions estimated from the jeans equations . these methods , while convenient , produce models that are slightly out of equilibrium and so require some relaxation time to damp out transients .",
    "moreover , the models readjust to a state different from the one proposed ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    as numerical methods and resolution",
    "improve it has become necessary to develop more sophisticated techniques to generate initial conditions . toward this end , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kd ) presented a set of semi - analytic models for the dfs of disk galaxies consisting of an exponential disk , a centrally concentrated bulge , and an extended halo .",
    "the dfs are constructed from integrals of motion and represent equilibrium solutions to the poisson and cb equations to a very good approximation and they have been used extensively to study different aspects of galaxy internal dynamics and interactions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "fitting models to actual galaxies requires one to `` observe '' the model and compare with real observations . by providing the full dfs ,",
    "the kd models enable one to add a level of realism to these pseudo - observations that is not possible with simple mass models .",
    "for example , a mass model rotation curve is constructed directly from the potential rather than from model line - of - sight velocities . with the kd models it is possible to construct the stellar rotation curve",
    "directly from stellar velocities and thereby incorporate asymmetric drift .",
    "gravitational microlensing experiments provide another example where improved pseudo - observations are possible since the full df allows for a self - consistent calculation of the predicted event rate distribution @xcite .",
    "the bulge and halo of the kd models are characterized by a constant density core . since their development",
    "it has become widely accepted from numerous cosmological simulations that dark halos have cuspy centers @xcite",
    ". detailed analysis of the central surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of early type galaxies and bulges suggest that these systems are also cuspy at their centres and furthermore contain supermassive black holes . we are therefore motivated to develop a new set of axisymmetric disk galaxy models with cuspy halos and bulges that also allow for the self - consistent addition of a supermassive central object .",
    "these models have many purposes .",
    "they provide the gravitational potential and mass and velocity distributions from the sphere of influence of the central black hole in the inner few parsecs out to the virial radius of the model galaxy .",
    "circular velocity curves , rotation curves incorporating asymmetric drift , velocity ellipsoids , line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) , and surface density ( brightness ) profiles can be generated easily .",
    "the large parameter space permits a wide range of models for comparison to real galaxies and the good quality of the initial equilibria make them ideal for studying subtle dynamical processes such as bar formation and disk warping and heating .",
    "the dfs are described in section 2 .",
    "examples that match photometric and dynamical data for the milky way and m31 are presented in section 3 .",
    "this section also presents results from numerical experiments on the stability of these models as well as a brief discussion of an m31 model that incorportates a supermassive black hole .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a summary and a discussion of possible applications of the models .",
    "the phase - space dfs for the disk , bulge , and halo of the kd models are chosen analytic functions of the integrals of motion . by jeans",
    "theorem , any such df yields a steady - state solution of the cbe in any potential that respects these integrals @xcite .",
    "a self - consistent self - gravitating model is one in which the potential and space density also satisfy the poisson equation .",
    "the kd models are , by design , axisymmetric with two known integrals of motion , the energy @xmath3 and the angular momentum about the symmetry axis @xmath4 .",
    "kd choose the king model df for the bulge which , in isolation , yields a system that is spherically symmetric and has a density profile characterized by a constant density core , an @xmath5 fall - off at intermediate radii , and a finite `` tidal '' radius where the density vanishes . for the halo , kd use the df of a lowered evans model which also exhibits a constant density core , power law intermediate region , and tidal radius .",
    "( we denote the tidal radius of the halo , which represents the outer edge of the system as a whole , as @xmath6 . )",
    "the configuration and velocity space distributions of the king and lowered evans models are modified once they are incorporated into a multi - component model .",
    "recall that for a system of collisionless particles in a static potential , any @xmath7 ( i.e. , any df that is a function only of the energy ) yields a steady - state solution of the cbe whose velocity distribution is isotropic @xcite .",
    "for an isolated self - gravitating system , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are necessarily spherically symmetric .",
    "( for a proof , see @xcite . ) in the presence of an aspherical external potential , an @xmath7 will yield an aspherical mass distribution through the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath9 .",
    "however , the velocities remain isotropic so long as @xmath10 does not depend on angular momentum or some other integral of motion . for the multi - component models considered here and in @xcite ,",
    "the disk potential causes a slight flattening of the bulge and halo .    in this section",
    "we describe new models that have an nfw halo , a hernquist bulge , and a central supermassive black hole .",
    "we begin by presenting dfs for the bulge and halo taken in isolation and then describe how these dfs are modified for composite models .",
    "@xcite found that the density profiles of dark matter halos in their cosmological simulations have a `` universal '' shape ( the so - called nfw profile ) of the form    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the scale radius , @xmath13 is a characteristic density , and @xmath14 is a characteristic velocity dispersion .",
    "( here and throughout we set newton s constant @xmath15 . )",
    "in contrast with the profile of the evans model halo , @xmath16 has an inner @xmath17 cusp and an extended @xmath18 outer halo .",
    "the gravitation potential for this profile is    @xmath19    our strategy is to use a df that , in the absence of a disk or bulge , yields a spherically symmetric nfw halo .",
    "we assume that the velocity dispersion is isotropic so that the df depends only on the energy @xmath3 .",
    "( formally , @xmath3 is the energy per unit mass . ) for a given density profile , the df can then be calculated through an abel transform @xcite a procedure that has been carried out for the nfw profile by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we write the df as a function of the relative energy @xmath20",
    "@xmath21    for the dimensionless df @xmath22 we use the analytic fitting formula    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a fourth - order polynomial with @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the nfw profile is infinite in extent and mass . for model building",
    "it is desireable to have a finite halo and so , following @xcite , we introduce an energy cutoff @xmath27 and replace @xmath28 with    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    @xmath31 corresponds to a full nfw profile while @xmath32 yields a truncated profile . examples with @xmath33 and various values of @xmath34 are shown in figure  [ fig : isolatedhalo ] .",
    "note that the truncation radius can be varied independent of the characteristic density and scale radius .",
    "when building models a natural choice for the truncation radius is the cosmologically - motivated virial radius , @xmath35 ( see below ) .",
    "after the inner properties of a model galaxy are set , a value of @xmath34 that gives @xmath36 can be easily found .",
    "in contrast , for the king and lowered evans models a change in the truncation radius results in a significant change in the inner profile making model building more cumbersome and less intuitive .",
    "the df as written above is symmetric under @xmath37 and therefore generates a model with no net rotation . by spitting the df into parts with positive and negative @xmath4 ( @xmath38 ) and recombining them with a suitable coefficient",
    ", one can generate a model with arbitrary amounts of rotation .",
    "formally we write    @xmath39    where @xmath40 controls the amount of rotation ( @xmath41 implies no rotation )",
    ".      bulges are commonly modelled as the de vaucouleurs @xmath42 law @xcite in projection and the hernquist model is a simple density - potential pair which closely mimics this behaviour @xcite .",
    "we therefore model the bulge using a hernquist df modified by a energy cutoff @xmath43 to truncate the profile in a fashion similar to what was done for the halo .",
    "the standard hernquist model has a density profile and potential given by    @xmath44    and    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the scale length , characteristic density , and characteristic velocity of the bulge . while the total mass is finite the density distribution is infinite in extent with @xmath49 at large radii .",
    "we modify the hernquist df by incorporating an energy cutoff :    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the infinite - extent hernquist model df ,    @xmath54    as with the halo , rotation is introduced through an additional parameter @xmath55 .",
    "it is straightforward to use other models for the bulge .",
    "for example , the potential and df for the density profile @xmath56 are analytic and the associated surface density profile provides a somewhat better match to the de vaucouleurs law than the surface density profile of the hernquist model @xcite .",
    "the disk is assumed to be axisymmetric with space density @xmath57 and quasi - maxwellian df taken directly from the kd models which , in turn , were based on the 2-d model by @xcite and extensions by @xcite .",
    "this df is a function of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the latter being an approximate third integral of motion that corresponds to the energy in vertical oscillations .",
    "an implicit assumption in the formulation of this df is that the velocity dispersions are small so that the epicyclic approximation is valid in the treatment of disk star orbits .",
    "this assumption limits the application of the models to cool disks .",
    "the df can be tuned to yield a space density of a desired form . as in kd , we assume that the surface density profile of the disk is exponential in the radial direction with scale radius @xmath60 and truncation radius @xmath61 .",
    "the vertical structure is given approximately by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the vertical scale height .",
    "in all , five parameters define the space density of the disk : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 , the mass @xmath64 , and a profile `` shape '' parameter @xmath65 which governs the sharpness of the truncation .",
    "the `` stars '' of the kd disks have nonzero velocity dispersions in the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions .",
    "the dispersion in the radial direction , @xmath66 , is assumed to be exponential : @xmath67 . for simplicity , we set @xmath68 in accord with observations by @xcite .",
    "the dispersion in the azimuthal direction is related to @xmath69 through the epicycle equations @xcite while the dispersion in the vertical direction is set by the vertical potential gradient and the vertical scale height .    in total , the dfs for the three components are characterized by fifteen parameters which we collect for convenience in table 1 .      an isolated model halo is constructed by solving poisson s equation self - consistently for the gravitational potential    @xmath70    together with the integral relation between the df ( eq.[eq : nfw_df2 ] ) , the density , and the relative potential @xmath71 :    @xmath72    @xcite . for a disk - bulge - halo model , eq.[eq : poisson ]",
    "is replaced by    @xmath73    where    @xmath74    is the total density .",
    "the dfs in this expression depend on the energy ( as well as other integrals of motion ) which in turn depends on @xmath75 . since @xmath75 is the total gravitational potential , the density fields of the different components are inter - related in a complicated way .",
    "in fact the components of a disk - bulge - halo model constructed from eq.6 of kd and eqs.[eq : nfw_df2 ] and [ eq : bulgedf ] may bare little resemblance to the corresponding isolated components , a situation that is cumbersome for model building .    to alleviate this problem , we proceed as follows .",
    "the df for an isolated halo is nonzero over the energy range @xmath76 .",
    "qualitatively , we may expect the energy range of halo particles in the multi - component system to be extended to @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the depth of the disk potential .",
    "these arguments suggest that we replace @xmath79 of eq.[eq : fhalo ] by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a function that maps the energy of a particle in the composite system ( @xmath82 ) to the energy of a particle in the would - be isolated halo ( @xmath83 ) . in what follows",
    ", we assume    @xmath84    by construction , at low binding energies @xmath85 , @xmath86 whereas @xmath87 as @xmath88 . for the bulge",
    ", we replace @xmath89 with @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "these mappings are by no means unique and , apart from the conditions discussed above , are not motivated by any particular physical model .",
    "indeed other mappings can be shown to yield similar and equally acceptable models .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] we show an example of the density profile and rotation curve for a typical disk - bulge - halo model .",
    "( the model parameters are given in table 2 . )",
    "also shown is the halo profile that results assuming the same values of the @xmath12 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 if the disk and bulge are not included .",
    "it is important to stress that the `` isolated halo '' in figure [ fig : figure2 ] is not meant to represent the progenitor for the halo in the final composite model .",
    "indeed , the structure of dark halos in fully developed disk galaxies can be determined only through detailed modeling of galaxy formation .",
    "according to the standard structure formation paradigm at early times baryons and dark matter are well - mixed .",
    "disks form when the ( collisional ) baryons lose energy ( but not angular momentum ) and settle to the bottom of the dark halo potential well .",
    "the halo in turn reponds to the change in the gravitational potential and therefore a pristine nfw halo will readjust to a new configuration .",
    "simulations of galaxy formation which include gasdynamics and star formation are still relatively crude and computationally expensive .",
    "an alternative is to treat the effect of baryon infall on dark halos as an adiabatic process @xcite . if changes in the potential are slow compared with the orbital time of dark halo particles , then for each particle , there is a set of quantites known as adiabatic invariants which remain approximately constant even as the orbit changes .",
    "knowledge of the adiabatic invariants allows one to determine the final df from the initial df without having to model the evolution of the system explicitly .    under a rather restrictive set of assumptions",
    ", the adiabatic theorem leads to the following simple relation :    @xmath94    @xcite . in this formula",
    ", @xmath95 is the baryon mass distribution as a function of radius ( i.e. , a spherically averaged representation of the disk and bulge ) , @xmath96 is the final distribution of the dark halo , and @xmath97 is the initial distribution of the baryon - dark matter proto - galaxy .",
    "eq.[eq : adiabatic ] allows one to go directly from the cosmologically - motivated nfw halo to the final dark halo in a fully - formed galaxy and has been used extensively in modeling disk galaxies ( see , for example , @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the dark halos predicted by eq.[eq : adiabatic ] are more centrally concentrated than the progenitors with a density profile that is cuspier in the center ( e.g. , @xmath17 cusp becomes an @xmath98 cusp as in figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "however eq.[eq : adiabatic ] is based on a number of suspect assumptions .",
    "in addition to spherical symmetry and adiabaticity , one must assume that the dark halo particles are on circular orbits and therefore do not cross as their orbits contract .",
    "the particle orbits in simulated halos are , if anything , radially biased .",
    "( see @xcite who study the importance of the distribution of orbits for the evolution of dark halos . )",
    "an indication of the uncertainty in the adiabatic prescription can be seen in figure 7 of @xcite where two halos from the same progenitor are shown . in one case ,",
    "eq.[eq : adiabatic ] is used to determine the halo profile while in the other , baryons and dark matter are allowed to exchange angular momentum .",
    "the difference between the two halos is significant with the former being denser in the central regions by a factor of 30 !",
    "how do our models fit in with the adiabatic compression paradigm ?",
    "in short , we side - step the issue by focusing on models of fully developed disk galaxies .",
    "one might use eq.[eq : adiabatic ] to work backwards from our final model and determine the progenitor ( and thus compare with the nfw profile ) but given the caveats associated with this equation we do not see this as a particularly fruitful endeavor . we do note that the difference between a model halo in isolation and one incorporated into a composite system is consistent with the general predictions of adiabatic compression theory  the profile exhibits a slightly cuspier inner region and is generally more concentrated  and so the naive use of the halo parameters as an indication of the general structure of the progenitor halo seems a reasonable first pass for making contact with cosmology .",
    "the observation that most , if not all , disk galaxies harbor supermassive black holes near their centers has led to considerable interest in the structure of black hole - stellar systems as well as the effect a black hole might have on the central cusp of a dark matter halo .",
    "@xcite have derived dfs for a variety of models with central black holes whose density profiles have @xmath99 central cusps and @xmath100 outer parts .",
    "these so - called @xmath101-models include the hernquist profile ( @xmath102 ) and are therefore directly applicable to the bulge df in our system and easily generalized to the nfw halo model .",
    "the dfs of @xcite produce a density profile that is independent of the black hole mass : for a given @xmath101-model , the black hole alters the velocity distribution but not the space distribution of the stars and dark matter particles in its vicinity .",
    "we build black holes into our models under the same assumption .",
    "consider first the bulge - black hole system .",
    "the effect of a black hole of mass @xmath103 is to modify the relative potential    @xmath104    where as in @xcite the superscript @xmath105 denotes properties of models that include a black hole . while the hernquist df is non - zero over the energy range @xmath106 , with a black hole , the energy range is extended to @xmath107 .    in principle ,",
    "disk - bulge - halo models with a central black hole can be constructed by replacing @xmath108 with a df from @xcite that is modified by a suitable energy cut - off .",
    "the dfs for the disk and halo would be similarly replaced .",
    "however , the dfs in @xcite are not analytic and would have to be recalculated for each choice of @xmath103 .",
    "we therefore choose the following more efficient , albeit _ ad hoc _ scheme : the potential and density profile for a particular disk - bulge - halo model are calculated assuming no black hole . to incorporate a black hole ,",
    "the potential is modified according to eq.[eq : psistar ] and a new df is found which interpolates between @xmath108 of eq.[eq : bulgedf ] and the df of the appropriate @xmath101-model .    at large binding energies ( @xmath109 )",
    "the hernquist - black hole df has the asymptotic form @xcite @xmath110 where    @xmath111    on the other hand ,    @xmath112    for @xmath113 . from the asympototic form of the hernquist potential , @xmath114",
    ", we have @xmath115 suggesting    @xmath116    as a mapping from @xmath82 to @xmath117 . by construction , @xmath118 .",
    "we take the df to be    @xmath119    which smoothly interpolates between @xmath120 and eq.[eq : asymhq ] .",
    "a similar procedure is carried out for the halo and disk .",
    "in this section we present models chosen to fit observational data for the milky way and andromeda galaxies .",
    "the level of realism in our models is dictated to a large extent by the assumptions upon which they are based . at first glance",
    ", the assumption of axisymmetry seems rather restrictive since virtually all disk galaxies exhibit non - axisymmetric phenomena such as bars and spiral arms .",
    "however , our models are subject to non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "the program adopted here is to find the best - fit axisymmetric model and determine , through n - body simulations , if the model evolves to a state that more closely matches the actual galaxy .",
    "this approach has already been applied to the milky way by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "another key assumption is that the model galaxies are comprised of three components , a disk , bulge , and halo , whereas actual disk galaxies also have stellar halos and globular clusters that are typically spheroidal , more extended than the bulge , but ( presumably ) less extended than the dark halo",
    ". it would be straightforward to include such systems in our models but since they contain relatively little mass we do not do so here .",
    "the inclusion of globular cluster systems might be of interest for studying their evolution during galaxy mergers and interactions .",
    "along similar lines , the structural parameters of the galactic disks ( e.g. , radial and vertical scale heights , velocity dispersion tensor ) depend on colour and metalicity @xcite whereas our models assume a single disk component .",
    "stellar disks may , in fact , be more accurately represented as two component systems with a young thin disk and an old thick disk .",
    "our models can be easily modified to include two or more disk - like components , an improvement which may prove relevant for detailed studies of bars and spiral structure .",
    "our models assume dfs for the bulge and halo that are functions of the energy so that the velocity distribution in these components is necessarily isotropic . by contrast , the velocity distributions in simulated halos are typically biased toward radial orbits with a velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "spherical models with nonzero anisotropy parameters can be constructed from functions of @xmath3 and @xmath122 where @xmath122 is the total angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath122 is not an integral of motion of a general axisymmetric .",
    "moreover , since disks rotate , we can be fairly certain that halos do as well .",
    "thus , realistic halo models require three or more integrals of motion",
    ". the velocity structure of dark matter particles will have an effect on the dynamical interaction between the halo and stellar components ( e.g. , the decay of the bar pattern speed through dynamical friction ) and so it may be of interest to consider more general halo dfs .",
    "we leave the investigation of these subtle effects for future work .",
    "perhaps the most severe assumption is that our models include only collisionless components whereas for some disk galaxies , a significant fraction of the `` disk '' mass is locked up in neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "future versions of our models will include hi disks thereby expanding the applications to models with gas as well as stars .    for each galaxy , we select a set of observational data which are compared with pseudo - observations of the model galaxy to yield a @xmath0-statistic .",
    "minimization of @xmath0 over the multi - dimensional parameter space yields the desired best - fit model .",
    "in addition , one can include non - observational constraints so as to select models with certain characteristics ( e.g. , specific value for the bulge - to - disk mass ratio , baryon fraction , or halo concentration parameter ) .",
    "in addition to the 15 parameters of table 1 observer - dependent parameters such as the inclination angle for external galaxies or the galactocentric radius of the sun for milky way must also be specified .",
    "in addition , if photometric data is used , then the mass - to - light ratios of the disk and bulge are also required .",
    "depending on the type of observations , some of the parameters may be fixed during the minimization process .",
    "following @xcite we employ the downhill simplex algorithm ( see , for example , @xcite ) for the minimization of @xmath0 .",
    "a simplex is a geometrical figure in @xmath123 dimensions where @xmath123 is the number of parameters that defines the model . during execution of the algorithm",
    ", the simplex moves through parameter space seeking out the minimum of @xmath0 .",
    "as it does so , the simplex changes shape thus enabling it to move through complicated regions of parameter space .",
    "the downhill simplex method has a number of advantages over minimization procedures based on gradients of @xmath0 ( e.g. , the method of steepest descent ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the method appears to be less susceptable to false minima though restarts are always executed to guard against this possibility .",
    "numerous authors have attempted to model the milky way with early important studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite fit star count data together with local values for the scale heights and luminosity functions to parameterize global models of the disk and bulge .",
    "@xcite considered dynamical constraints ( e.g. , the oort constants , rotation curve ) in constructing three - component mass models .",
    "more recently , @xcite improved and updated these models by augmenting rotation curve data with dynamical constraints on the vertical structure of the galaxy in the solar neighborhood .      the models developed here for the milky way are assembled in the same spirit of early mass models but have the advantage that the end result is a fully realized df for the stars and dark matter of the galactic system .",
    "seven observational data sets are used to constrain the milky way models .",
    "five of these data sets , the inner and outer rotation curves , the oort constants , the vertical force in the solar neighborhood , and the total mass at large radii are taken directly from @xcite and references therein .",
    "we also use measurements of the bulge dispersion at a projected distance of @xmath124 from the galactic center ( the peak of the dispersion profile ) from the compilation of data by @xcite .",
    "finally , we incorporate estimates of the local velocity ellipsoid from @xcite .",
    "* _ inner rotation curve _",
    "+ observations of hi emission provide a direct measure of the galactic rotation curve . inside the solar circle",

    "morover , with the new models , the truncation radius of the nfw halo can be varied independent of the inner density profiles of the three components ( figure [ fig : isolatedhalo ] ) .",
    "thus , one can tune the truncation radius to correspond to the virial radius as predicted by cosmology or alternatively , constrain the outer halo using observations of the m31 satellite system .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we utilize measurements of andromeda s surface brightness profile , rotation curve , and bulge velocity profiles .",
    "we use the global r - band surface brightness profile from @xcite which was obtained by averaging the light distribution over elliptical rings assuming an inclination of @xmath205 .",
    "the global surface brightness profile represents a small subset of the available photometric data . in principle a more sophisticated bulge - disk decomposition , where the thickness of the disk and inclination angle enter as free parameters , could be performed using two - dimensional surface brightness maps .",
    "however , apparent deviations of the galaxy from axisymmetry suggest that our models can not adequately reflect this level of detail . for example",
    ", the position angle of the major axes of elliptical isophotes varies with galactocentric radius suggesting that the bulge is barlike and triaxial .",
    "triaxiality can be introduced in a controlled way , for example by `` adiabatically molding '' the model into the desired shape @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can evolve , via n - body methods , a model galaxy that has a weak bar instability to see if some intermediate state is consistent with the observations ( e.g. , twisting isophotes ) .",
    "such an exercise might further constrain the models and help break the mass - to - light degeneracy .    for the rotation curve",
    "we combine measurements by @xcite and @xcite using the same kernel smoothing as in @xcite .",
    "the composite rotation curve extends from @xmath206 in galactocentric radii .",
    "though the measurements in @xcite extend to @xmath207 , we ignore data beyond @xmath208 since for this region of the galaxy , measurements were made along a single spiral arm on one side of the galaxy .",

    "acceptable fits were found though in general , the models had a difficult time simultaneously reproducing a rising rotation curve and falling dispersion profile .",
    "one possible explanation is that the `` bulge '' data is contaminated by the disk ( a rapidly rotating , dynamically cold system ) .",

    "the vertical scale length , truncation radius , and truncation shape parameter are fixed at the values @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 respectively . since our data",
    "do not depend on the dispersion of disk stars , the parameters @xmath220 and @xmath221 are not required for the fitting algorithm though they are required for generating an n - body realization .",
    "the halo parameters @xmath14 and @xmath12 are allowed to vary while the truncation parameter @xmath34 is fixed to a value large enough so that the truncation radius is well outside the visible part of the galaxy .",

    "the general structure of a valley running approximately parallel to the @xmath223-axis arises for two reasons .",

    "hence , @xmath224 is relatively well - determined . by contrast",
    ", the primary constraint on the disk mass comes from the rotation curve .",
    "but since the disk and halo contributions to the rotation curve are similar , one can be played off the other and therefore the @xmath223 is poorly constrained .",
    "the degeneracy with respect to the disk mass - to - light ratio is generic to modeling of spiral galaxies and has been known for some time ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken by fixing the disk mass - to - light ratio to a theoretically preferred value , e.g. , one derived from population synthesis models .",
    "alternatively , one may constrain the disk mass - to - light ratio by requiring that the galaxy model be stable against the formation of a strong bar . as with the milky way",
    ", m31 may have a weak bar and so absolute stability is not a requirement ( or even desirable ) .",
    "however , models with very heavy disks can clearly be ruled out as we demonstrate in the next section .",
    "a third possibility is to include an additional data set that probes more directly the disk mass distribution such as disk velocity dispersion measurements as in the study by @xcite of ngc5170 .    the mass - to - light ratios in figure [ fig : contour ]",

    "the ratio @xmath271 makes this a  fast \" bar in the standard nomenclature ( e.g. @xcite ) at least at this stage of the simulation .",
    "while m31 appears to have a triaxial bar - like bulge , at present , it does not appear to be a well - developed barred spiral .",
    "the absence of a bar in m31 suggests that the disk mass in model d is too great and that one of the other models is more acceptable for m31 .",
    "we also simulated the two milky way models and found little evolution in the velocity ellipsoid , vertical scale height , surface density , and space density again illustrating the excellent quality of the models as a means of setting up initial conditions for n - body simulations .",
    "not surprisingly , model mwa ( where the disk provides the dominant contribution to the rotation curve at intermediate radii ) develops a bar while mwb appears to be stable .      in this section",
    ", we examine an axisymmetric model of m31 augmented by a central black hole .",
    "m31 is the nearest galaxy with a demonstrable central black hole but unfortunately exhibits a complex central structure in the form of a double nucleus @xcite .",
    "estimates of the black hole mass based on dynamical models and the observed bulge surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles fall in the range @xmath272 @xcite .    as an illustration of our models ,",
    "we place a black hole of mass @xmath273 at the center of model m31a .",
    "figures [ fig : m31bh1 ] and [ fig : m31bh2 ] show the line - of - sight velocity dispersion and surface density profiles . to generate the inner portion of the curves ( dashed lines ) in figure [ fig : m31bh1 ] we sample 10 m particles from the bulge df within a thin tube 20 pc in radius centered on the galaxy and aligned with the symmetry axis .",
    "the dispersion profile exhibits the characteristic intermediate minimum and maximum seen in the data @xcite .",
    "we also simulate a galaxy model including a blackhole to test the quality of the equilibrium focusing on the nuclear region close to the blackhole .",
    "the blackhole moves freely as single particle within the simulation . for this test ,",
    "we put most of the particles in the bulge , @xmath274 so the ratio of the blackhole mass to the bulge particle mass is @xmath275 .",
    "the enclosed mass of bulge stars equals the blackhole mass at a radius @xmath276 .",
    "there are only the halo and disk are represented by 2 m and 1 m particles respectively but their particles are unlikely to interact with the blackhole in this test .",
    "we set the particle and blackhole softening length to @xmath277 and use a single timestep of @xmath278 . even with a total of @xmath274 particles in the bulge , there are only 13 bulge particles initially within the softening radius .",
    "figure [ fig : m31bh2 ] also shows the evolution of the model focusing on the central region surrounding the black hole .",
    "the simulation is run for 3000 timesteps corresponding to approximately 18 orbital times at a radius of @xmath183 .",
    "we see that there is some evolution of the system  towards the center , the velocity dispersion fluctuates slightly within @xmath279 pc and the surface density increases slightly . at @xmath280 pc where there are only a dozen or so particles ,",
    "we expect larger initial variations that may explain the settling to a slightly higher density .",
    "nevertheless , the profiles remain close to the initial state suggesting that the equilibrium is reasonable .",
    "these effects may be also result indirectly from using force softening or a reflection of the approximations that have gone into the df .",
    "clearly , high numerical resolution is needed to treat the dynamics of stars around a central blackhole and the short orbital times make these technically difficult and costly .",
    "models such as this one may be used as initial conditions for numerical experiments of black hole dynamics during galaxy merger events such as the simulations by @xcite and will be explored in future investigations .",
    "our goals in this paper have been threefold .",
    "first we have presented a new set of model dfs for multi - component disk galaxies .",
    "second , we have identified particular models that fit observational data for the milky way and m31 .",
    "finally , we have explored the stability of the models using numerical simulations .",
    "our dfs respresent self - consistent axisymmetric equilibrium solutions to the poisson and cb equations .",
    "the disk and bulge dfs are motivated by observations while the halo df is motivated by results from cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "the models permit the inclusion of a central supermassive black hole .",
    "historically , two approaches have been used to construct dfs for equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the first approach is to propose a df built from chosen functions of the integrals of motion and then calculate the density by solving the poisson equation .",
    "the second is to calculate the df from the desired density profile via an integral equation known as the abel transform .",
    "our dfs are the product of a hybrid scheme .",
    "the df for the isolated nfw halo was derived from the abel transform , modified by the energy mapping as described in the text , and then used for the halo in the composite system .",
    "our models are defined by 15 free parameters which may be tuned to fit a wide range of observational data .",
    "typically most of the parameters are poorly constrained .",
    "a galaxy s surface brightness profile is , in general , adequate to fix the disk scale length and , in combination with velocity dispersion and rotation curve measurements , provides a constraint on the disk mass and halo and bulge structural parameters .",
    "however degeneracies remain primarily due to uncertainties in the disk and bulge mass - to - light ratios .",
    "theoretical considerations such as results from population synthesis studies or numerical experiments of the bar instability can help narrow down the field of acceptable models .",
    "additional data for external galaxies such as velocity dispersion measurements in the disk may help break the @xmath281 degeneracy . observations of edge - on spiral galaxies can be used to constrain the vertical scale height and disk trucation parameters @xcite .",
    "we have constructed sequences of models for the milky way and m31 which provide excellent fits to available data .",
    "the models serve to illustrate the general proceduce for searching a large parameter space to find acceptable models for particular galaxies .",
    "a primary purpose of our models is to provide initial conditions for n - body experiments and well - developed techniques allow one to sample the dfs with arbitrary numbers of particles . through a series of numerical experiments ,",
    "we have explored the quality of the models as initial conditions and their stability to the formation of bars .",
    "models in which the disk contribution to the rotation curve is always subdominant to that of the bulge and halo tend to be stable against bar formation and therefore provide the best laboratory to study the quality of the model dfs .",
    "our analysis of one such model indicates that the dfs do indeed provide excellent initial conditions .",
    "the radial profiles of the space density , surface density , velocity dispersion tensor , and vertical scale height all remain relatively constant over @xmath282 .",
    "areas where we do see some evolution may be understood from simple considerations .",
    "for example , the bulge evolves from hernquist cusp to core inside the softening length because the velocity distribution is calculated assuming an unsoftened force - law .",
    "spiral density waves , generated by swing - amplification of shot noise cause the disk to thicken , but only by about 10% .",
    "our models allow for the addition of a central supermassive black hole .",
    "our prescription for doing this maintains the density distribution of the black hole - less models while modifying the velocities to establish a new dynamical equilibria near the black hole .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles of our black hole models have the right characteristics to match the data , namely high dispersion near the black hole falling to a minimum at tens of parsecs , rising at a radius of a hundred or so parsecs , and then falling again as one moves further out in radius .",
    "thus , we may be able to model galaxies from the sphere of influence of the black hole out to the virial radius , an impressive dynamic range of five or more orders of magnitude .",
    "there are numerous open avenues for future work .",
    "the model fitting algorithm can accomodate any number and type of observations and one may add to the pseudo - observations layers of realism such as statistical fluctuations and the effects of seeing .",
    "our m31 study used a small subset of the available photometric and kinematic data .",
    "two - dimensional surface brightness and dispersion maps reveal the presence of the bar and may be compared with corresponding maps from the `` evolved '' models providing a further constraint on the model .",
    "a classic problem in galactic dynamics is the disruption of satellite systems by the tidal field of the parent galaxy .",
    "the discovery of an arc of stars associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( see @xcite and references therein ) has intensified interest in performing simulations of the tidal disruption of this system @xcite ( see also @xcite for a study of the andromeda stream in a disk - bulge - halo model of m31 ) .",
    "our models offer the possibility of performing such simulations realistic and fully - self - consistent models for both parent and satellite systems .",
    "since a primary goal of previous investigations has been to constrain the shape of the galactic halo , our models will have to be extended to include triaxial systems if they are to be useful in this endeavor .",
    "the extension to triaxial systems might be accomplished by adiabatically molding the models as in @xcite .",
    "our models might be extended in other important ways such as the inclusion of a globular cluster system or thick disk as discussed in the text .",
    "perhaps the most significant and challenging improvement would be to add a gas component and star formation since this would enable the study of spiral structure and bar formation with a far greater level of realism .",
