    "the presence of radio plasma produces all three sz effects discussed in this paper : the expanding lobes of radio galaxies ( rgs ) and radio - loud quasars compress and may shock the ambient igm , thereby increasing its thsz effect . during the inflation phase of the radio lobes the ambient medium",
    "is pushed aside , leading to a possible ksz effect . and finally the relativistic electron content of the radio plasma produces the rsz effect .",
    "the inflation phase of a rg is short compared to cosmological times , thus we do not consider the transient kinematic effect . furthermore , since gas on both sides of the radio lobes is accelerated in different directions , giving contributions of opposite sign but similar strength which should therefore roughly cancel out . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ghostenergy ] we argue that the combined ksz effect of an isotropic ensemble of flows is practically indistinguishable from a thsz effect with the same energy content , further justifying our simplified treatment .",
    "radio lobes become unobservable due to adiabatic , ic- and synchrotron energy losses of the electrons on a time - scale shorter than the expansion time of the radio lobes which leads to pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium ( e.g. kaiser et al .",
    "however , the energy transfered to the igm by the expansion of the lobes , and also the relativistic electron population remain and leave their fingerprints in the cmb spectrum via comptonization .",
    "the radio plasma and later radio ghosts will expand or contract until they reach pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium .",
    "the pressure of the radio ghost is given by that of the confined relativistic particles and the magnetic fields , assumed to be in rough energy equipartition .",
    "thus the magnetic field energy densities should be of the order of the thermal energy density of the environment .",
    "subsonic turbulence in this environment , which has an energy density below the thermal energy density , is therefore not strong enough to overcome the magnetic elastic forces of the radio ghost if the magnetic field in the ghost is contiguous on large scales . in the case of a magnetic field",
    "disjoined on scales smaller than the physical size of the ghost and/or the turbulence being sonic or super - sonic , which is e.g. expected in giant merger events of cluster of galaxies , it can ` shred ' the ghost into smaller pieces",
    ". the size of such pieces will be comparable to the eddy size of the turbulence .",
    "this means , since a typical turbulent spectrum has less energy density on smaller scales , that there is a length - scale below which the turbulence is not able to overcome magnetic forces .",
    "turbulent erosion of radio ghosts should stop at this length - scale , leaving small - scale patches of still unmixed old radio plasma .",
    "similarly , fluid instabilities of kelvin - helmholtz or rayleigh - taylor type at the surface of the ghost will not lead to a complete mixing of the radio plasma with the surrounding matter .",
    "the relativistic electrons suffer from adiabatic losses during the inflation phase of the radio plasma , afterwards only from synchrotron and ic- losses .",
    "coulomb- and bremsstrahlung - losses are negligible in a tenuous relativistic plasma .",
    "the cooling of an ultra - relativistic electron with momentum @xmath97 is governed by @xmath98 ( kardashev 1962 ) , where we ignored adiabatic losses or gains due to volume changes .",
    "the coefficient @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for coulomb , bremsstrahlung , and synchrotron / ic losses are ( rephaeli 1979 , blumenthal & gould 1970 ) @xmath102 where the electron density of the background gas is @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the magnetic field and @xmath105 the cmb photon energy density .",
    "the plasma frequency is @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the fine - structure constant . in order to judge the importance of the different terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cool ] ) we define the cooling times @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "we note , that in the following estimates the radio plasma is assumed to contain relativistic electrons only above @xmath114 . from these timescales",
    "it becomes obvious that as long as the electron density within the radio plasma stays below @xmath115 only synchrotron and ic losses have to be taken into account .",
    "if the radio plasma does not mix on a microscopic scale with the ambient medium this can be expected .",
    "in the following we assume that this is indeed the case .",
    "we note that in the case of a cold denser gas component in the radio plasma the coulomb cooling heats the cold electron and this heat contributes to the thsz - effect .",
    "the evolution of the relativistic electron distribution function in this case can be calculated analytically for constant conditions in the plasma ( @xmath116 ) ( enlin et al .",
    "if coulomb- and bremsstrahlung - cooling can be neglected eq .",
    "( [ eq : cool ] ) is solved by @xmath117^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where the brackets ( @xmath118 ) indicate time - averaged quantities , and @xmath119 is the momentum at @xmath120 .",
    "in order to demonstrate that even under disadvantageous conditions electrons stay relativistic we insert @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 corresponding to an time - average over the cmb energy density between today and @xmath124 in an eds universe . the final electron momentum after",
    "@xmath125 gyr cooling is still @xmath126 .",
    "thus , practically all relativistic electrons in old radio plasma stay relativistic for cosmological times .",
    "their energies change , but this is not important for the rsz effect in the spectral region of the cmb : the rsz decrement depends practically only on the number of relativistic electrons , and not on their energy .",
    "this is because all the up - scattered photons have energies far above the cmb range , so that their actual energy does not influence measurements within this range ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , a search for up - scattered photons is a promising way to detect the rsz - effect of very low energy relativistic electrons .      beside the possibility to see a rsz signature , discussed in this article , there are a few other possibilities to detect radio ghosts .",
    "radio ghosts are practically unobservable as long as their electron population remains at low energies .",
    "but if the population is re - accelerated the ghost becomes radio luminous again .",
    "this can happen when the ghost is dragged into a large - scale shock wave , e.g. in a merger event of clusters of galaxies or at the accretion shock where the matter is falling onto a cluster .",
    "the emission region is expected to be irregularly shaped , and should exhibit linear polarization due to the compression of the magnetic fields in the shock .",
    "such regions are indeed observed in the periphery of a few clusters of galaxies and are called ` cluster radio relics ' ( for reviews , see jaffe 1992 and feretti & giovannini 1996 ) .",
    "their properties , such as degree and direction of polarization , surface luminosity , peripheral position etc .",
    ", can be understood within such a scenario ( enlin et al .",
    "the observed rarity of the cluster radio relic phenomena can be understood in this context : the presence of a shock wave , which should be quite frequently found in and near clusters of galaxies , is not sufficient to produce a cluster radio relic , a radio ghost has to be present at the same location , too .",
    "another way to detect the presence of radio ghosts is via their ability to magnetically scatter ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays ( cr ) ( enlin 1999 ) . without such scattering",
    "the distribution of sky arrival directions of uhe cr should trace their source distribution within @xmath127 mpc , due to the limited distance protons above @xmath128 ev can travel without strong photo - pion energy losses ( greisen 1966 , zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ) . if the distribution of uhe cr sources follows that of the matter in the local universe a non - uniform arrival direction distribution is expected , contrary to the observations .",
    "medina tanco & enlin ( in preparation ) show that under optimistic assumptions about their distribution radio ghosts can sufficiently isotropize the uhe cr arrival directions .",
    "since the uhe cr scattering angle decreases with particle energy , this scenario can in principle be tested , as soon as sufficient cr data is available .",
    "the energy a radio galaxy release into a radio ghost and its environment during its lifetime is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the volume occupied by the ghost , @xmath131 the pressure inside and outside the ghost and @xmath132 is the energy density in the remnant radio plasma , split into its leptonic ( @xmath133 ) , hadronic ( @xmath134 ) and magnetic ( @xmath135 ) part .",
    "unfortunately , the ratios between these energy densities are still undetermined . the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 take account of this .",
    "the radio plasma is expected to follow a relativistic equation of state ( @xmath138 ; note that isotropically oriented magnetic fields also follow a relativistic equation of state ) .",
    "the fraction of @xmath139 stored as volume work in the ambient medium is therefore @xmath140 this thermal energy produces a thsz effect in addition to that expected from the heat in the igm due to structure formation .",
    "it seems to be difficult to follow this energy in an expanding universe with ongoing structure formation .",
    "but it can be argued that this energy is released into gravitationally bound structures ( clusters and filaments of galaxies ) .",
    "filaments expand due to the hubble flow , but the matter within a given filament flows into the next galaxy cluster and gets compressed thereby .",
    "this means , that on a longer time - scale the extra heat from rg is expected to be confined in clusters of galaxies and does not suffer from adiabatic losses .",
    "in fact , part of the energy injected into the environment might also be stored gravitationally whenever gas is pushed to a higher gravitational potential or transformed to kinetic energy of gas flows .",
    "gravitational energy is converted to kinetic energy , whenever the accelerated gas flows into the next potential well . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : deltai(x)approx ] ) and ( [ eq : barbeta ] ) one would conclude that the ksz effect is zero for an average of isotropically oriented flows .",
    "but eq . ( [ eq : deltai(x)approx ] ) is only an approximation .",
    "a better description of the average ksz effect for an isotropic ensemble of flows can be gained by the following argument : the individual electron velocities of all flows measured in the cmb - rest frame can be combined into a single momentum space distribution function , which is of course isotropic .",
    "this function can be used in order to calculate the comptonization with the formalism described in sect .",
    "[ sec : transrelic ] , since the latter does not depend on the position of an electron along the line of sight in the optically thin limit .",
    "the kinetic energies are non - relativistic , so that the spectral changes are well described by the function @xmath141 times the total kinetic energy of the electrons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gtild ] ) .",
    "thus the comptonization is independent of the exact spectral shape of the electron spectrum or the distribution of flow velocities .",
    "therefore we assume that all of the energy , which the inflating radio lobes give to their environment , contributes to the thsz effect . a similar argumentation for gaussian , isotropic , random velocity fields was given in zeldovich et al .",
    "( 1972 ) .",
    "we approximate the relativistic electron spectrum by a single power - law ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : fe , pow ] ) ) , so that the energy density @xmath133 and the number density @xmath142 of the relativistic electron of a ghost are related via the average kinetic energy of the electrons ( @xmath143 ) : @xmath144 the approximation assumes the particles to be ultra - relativistic ( @xmath145 ) and the distribution to be dominated by the lower end ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) . in the case that the distribution has a trans- or non - relativistic part the exact formulae for energy density , pressure and adiabatic index can be found in appendix a.    if the ultra - relativistic approximation is valid and the low energy electrons dominate the spectrum , we can write : @xmath148 all the quantities on the rhs have to be inserted for the same stage of the radio plasma evolution in order to give a consistent result .",
    "the best observational constraints for these quantities are of course given for the moment of injection , when the radio plasma is visible .",
    "we estimate now the comptonization due to energy from radio galaxies stored in different forms into the igm .",
    "we have to calculate the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ygas ] ) and ( [ eq : yrel ] ) in a cosmological context . we need to know the distribution of injected heat and relativistic electrons .",
    "since both quantities ( injected thermal heat in the igm and number of relativistic electrons in the radio plasma ) are accumulative in the sense , that radio galaxies produce them , but cooling mechanisms are insufficient to remove them . for the thermal energy",
    "this is clear , since except for cooling flows in the very center of some cluster of galaxies the cooling time exceeds the hubble time . for the number density of relativistic electrons",
    "this follows from the fact that the dominant cooling mechanism in a tenuous relativistic plasma are synchrotron- and ic - cooling , which become inefficient for low energy electrons ( see sec [ sec : radiopl ] ) .",
    "the integrands in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ygas ] ) and ( [ eq : yrel ] ) are proportional to the amount of remnant radio plasma at a given epoch ( e.g. measured by the number density of relativistic electrons @xmath149 ) .",
    "since , as we argued , radio plasma is conserved , its electron density is given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the source electron density of radio plasma at time @xmath41 in comoving coordinates .",
    "the optical depth of relativistic plasma can then be written as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the time between today and redshift @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is the maximal redshift of injection .",

    "this means that the thsz decrement due to the thermal igm heating by inflating radio lobes always dominates over the rsz decrement of the relativistic electron population in these radio lobes since @xmath167 in the rayleight - jeans regime ( see fig .",

    "( [ eq : deltai(x)approx ] ) for details ) .",
    "the thsz increment in the wien - regime decreases exponential and therefore much faster than the rsz increment of a power - law electron population .",
    "therefore the rsz effect of radio plasma dominates over its induced thsz effect at sufficiently high frequencies as long as the electron population stays relativistic .",
    "the total jet power of radio galaxies per comoving volume can be derived from the radio luminosity function of rg with the additional assumption that there is a unique relation between radio luminosity and jet power .",
    "this is not strictly correct , since it is known that for the largest part of the observed lifetime of rgs they should exhibit some luminosity evolution , even in models with constant jet power ( for the case of powerful rg of type frii see e.g. begelman & cioffi ( 1989 ) , falle ( 1991 ) , kaiser & alexander ( 1997 ) , kaiser et al .",

    "a rough estimate of @xmath169 can be derived from observations of radio lobes embedded in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of clusters of galaxies .",
    "these observations show a discrepancy of the thermal icm - pressure to the pressure in the radio plasma following minimal energy arguments of a factor of @xmath170 , even if projection effects are taken into account ( e.g. feretti et al . 1992 ) .",

    "however , the space density of the flat spectrum population , which is thought to consist mainly of fri - type objects , is at least a factor 10 smaller at any given redshift ( dunlop & peacock 1990 )",

    "we applied this theory to radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies :    although a single radio galaxy produces a negligible sz decrement , the combined effect of several radio galaxies and their remnants might produce a detectable signal . in order to show this we estimated the total cosmological release in jet power of radio galaxies using the observed radio luminosity function converted by an empirical jet power - radio luminosity relation .",

    "sz based @xmath191 determinations have to be corrected to higher values due to this effect .    finally , we demonstrated that future cmb telescopes such as the planck satellite seemed to be useful tools to measure supra - thermal electron populations in clusters of galaxies .",
