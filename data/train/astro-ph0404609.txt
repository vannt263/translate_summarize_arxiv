    "intervening damped ly@xmath0 absorption - line systems ( dlas ) in quasar spectra are very rare , with an incidence of @xmath19 per unit redshift at @xmath1 ( rao , turnshek , & nestor 2004 , hereafter rtn2004 ) . consequently ,",
    "unless dlas are correlated , the appearance of two dlas along any single quasar sightline ( `` double - damped '' ) represents a very unlikely event . as such , the discovery of any double - damped absorption warrants a closer investigation .",
    "here we report the discovery of double - damped absorption near @xmath1 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar q1727 + 5302 during our most recent _ hubble space telescope _",
    "uv spectroscopic survey for dlas ( rtn2004 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to report initial results pertaining to this discovery , and thereby encourage future studies of this region of the sky .",
    "the velocity separation of the absorption is 13,000 km s@xmath5 , which corresponds to a proper radial distance of @xmath20 mpc if interpreted as due to the hubble flow . ,",
    "@xmath8 , and @xmath21 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( @xmath22 ) . ]",
    "we speculate that this configuration may represent a neutral hydrogen gas filament with a large cosmological extent along our sightline .",
    "in fact , the comoving size of this putative filament would be larger than anything previously reported .",
    "as discussed in earlier contributions ( e.g. , rao & turnshek 2000 , hereafter rt2000 , and references therein ) , dlas are excellent tracers of the bulk of the neutral hydrogen gas in the universe , and the aim of our most recent dla uv survey has been to improve our knowledge of the incidence and cosmological mass density of dlas at redshifts @xmath23 .",
    "the new sample which led to the discovery of the double - damped absorption was derived from the sdss early data release ( edr ) ( schneider et al .",
    "we applied a strong - rest equivalent width ( rew ) selection criterion ( rt2000 ) to optical spectra in order to identify candidate dla absorption lines ( @xmath24 atoms @xmath4 ) , and then we obtained hst stis uv spectra to confirm or refute their presence .",
    "the current overall success rate for identifying dlas with this method is @xmath17% .",
    "since the @xmath252796,2803 absorption lines are saturated , the rew of the absorption is most closely tied to kinematic spread , not column density .",
    "recently , nestor et al . (",
    "2003 ) have discussed evidence for a correlation between kinematic spread and metallicity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the hst discovery spectrum for the double - damped absorption , a follow - up mmt spectrum used to determine neutral - gas - phase metal abundances , and irtf imaging data used to search for galaxies associated with the double - damped absorbers along the quasar sightline . in ",
    "3 we summarize evidence that exists for strong absorption systems near @xmath1 in other sdss quasars in the same region of the sky . a brief summary and discussion of the results is presented in  4 .",
    "q1727 + 5302 ( sdss j172739.03 + 530229.16 ) is the j2000 coordinate designation of the quasar which exhibits double - damped absorption near @xmath1 .",
    "the quasar has an emission redshift of @xmath26 and an sdss g - band magnitude of 18.3 .",
    "a search for the @xmath252796,2803 absorption doublet in bright ( @xmath27 ) sdss edr quasars resulted in the identification of two systems along this sightline at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "table 1 gives rews of some of the identified metal absorption lines .",
    "the spectrum shown in figure 1 was obtained during a 73 minute exposure with the hst on 1 january 2003 in the stis nuv g230l mode .",
    "see rtn2004 for details of the observing program .",
    "the dla lines at @xmath30 and @xmath31 are visible .",
    "the insert to the figure shows two voigt damping profiles that have been fitted simultaneously to the two ly@xmath0 lines .",
    "these have neutral hydrogen column densities of @xmath32 atoms @xmath4 and @xmath33 atoms @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath34 errors were determined by assessing uncertainties in the continuum fit as described in rt2000 .",
    "we used the 6.5-m mmt on 2 july 2003 to obtain spectroscopic observations of both systems making up the double - damped absorption in order to determine their neutral gas phase metal abundances .",
    "we used the and lines ( figure 2 ) , as well as , , and lines ( not shown ) .",
    "the method employed to measure the metal abundances is the same as that used by nestor et al .",
    "relative to the solar measurements of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , we find zn abundances of [ zn / h ] = @xmath35 ( 26.5% solar ) and @xmath36 ( 4.7% solar ) for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 systems , respectively .",
    "the corresponding cr abundances are [ cr / h ] = @xmath37 ( 5.5% solar ) and @xmath38 ( 1.7% solar ) , so there is evidence for depletion onto grains .",
    "these determinations fall within the range of dla metallicities that have been reported near @xmath1 ( e.g. , see prochaska et al .",
    "also , for the @xmath28 system we find [ si / h ] = @xmath39 ( 15.6% solar ) , [ fe / h ] = @xmath40 ( 4.3% solar)hiresdla by jason prochaska .",
    "] , and [ mn / h ] = @xmath41 ( 6.6% solar ) ; for the @xmath29 system we find [ si / h ] = @xmath42 ( 3.5% solar ) , [ fe / h ] = @xmath43 ( 0.8% solar)@xmath44 , and [ mn / h ] = @xmath45 ( 1.3% solar ) .",
    "some of our recent imaging results on low - redshift dlas have been reported by rao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . on 2",
    "april 2003 we made similar ir ( jhk bands ) observations of the double - damped sightline with the 3.0-m irtf .",
    "figure 3 shows a 14  x 14section of the h - band image centered on the quasar .",
    "the limiting 1@xmath46 surface brightness is 22.0 h magnitudes per square arcsec .",
    "objects labeled g1 and g2 are reasonable candidates for the dla galaxies based on their proximity to the sightline . if at @xmath1 , their impact parameters of @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to proper transverse distances of @xmath49 kpc and @xmath50 kpc , respectively .",
    "g1 and g2 have h - band magnitudes of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "they are also visible in our j - band and k - band images ( not shown ) , with magnitudes @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .    adopting @xmath57 from local galaxies studies ( e.g. , bell et al .",
    "2003 ) , a @xmath58-correction appropriate for an sa type galaxy from poggianti ( 1997 ) , and assuming no evolution , a local @xmath59 galaxy redshifted to @xmath1 would have @xmath60 for our adopted cosmology .",
    "we note that at @xmath1 @xmath58-corrections for all galaxy types are relatively small in the k - band , and the magnitudes of g1 and g2 would correspond to luminosities of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , if they were at @xmath1 .",
    "however , recently ellis & jones ( 2004 ) have presented k - band observations of the galaxy population residing in three x - ray selected massive clusters at @xmath63",
    ". fits to their data indicate that at redshifts near @xmath1 the galaxy population in massive clusters has @xmath64 lying in the range @xmath65 mag .",
    "thus , @xmath66 is @xmath67 mag brighter than @xmath68 , which is what might be expected from passive evolution .",
    "therefore , g1 and g2 are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , and it should be emphasized that there are no good candidate dla galaxies with luminosities near @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , if g1 and g2 are passively evolving dla galaxies , they can simply be interpreted as the progenitors of local dwarfs .",
    "we note that if g1 was at the quasar redshift ( @xmath26 ) , it would be @xmath71 .",
    "however , g1 is offset from the quasar , so if it were related to the quasar it would likely be associated with an interaction .",
    "low - redshift quasar host galaxies are generally several times @xmath72 ( e.g. , hamilton , casertano , & turnshek 2002 ; jahnke & wisotzki 2003 ) .",
    "one way to test the hypothesis that the double - damped absorption represents an extended filament along our sightline is to search for absorption near @xmath1 in other quasars with @xmath73 that lie approximately in the same direction .",
    "this possibility can be considered since the sdss has searched this region of the sky for quasars .",
    "five other @xmath73 quasars are known that meet the criteria of having spectra of high enough quality to detect strong - systems and lying within 30 arcmin of the double - damped sightline .",
    "an angular size of 30 arcmin ( sdss data presently cut off beyond this on one edge ) is considerably smaller than the putative @xmath74 mpc ( proper distance ) long filament at @xmath1 , but this is reasonable if we are viewing cosmic structure along a filament .",
    "all five of these other quasars fall below the brightness limits used for inclusion in our current hst uv survey for low - redshift dlas ( rtn2004 ) .",
    "three of the quasars ( sdss q1727 + 5301 at z@xmath75 , sdss q1727 + 5306 at z@xmath76 , and sdss q1729 + 5312 at z@xmath77 ) do not show evidence for strong absorption near @xmath1 , so there is little chance that they have dla absorption near @xmath1 .",
    "however , the remaining two do show strong - absorption which meet the criterion for selecting dla candidates ( rt2000 ) .",
    "the sightline locations and presence of absorption may constrain the geometry of any filament .",
    "the two new absorption systems ( rews are reported in table 1 ) are at @xmath78 ( in sdss q1725 + 5254 at @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( in sdss q1727 + 5311 at @xmath81 ) , separated from the double - damped sightline by @xmath82 arcmin and @xmath83 arcmin , respectively .",
    "thus , there are four strong - absorption systems that lie along similar sightlines , within a redshift spread of @xmath84 , corresponding to a velocity separation of @xmath85 km s@xmath5 . given our strong - selection criterion , if these new systems are not dlas , they are almost certainly sub - dlas with column densities @xmath86 atoms @xmath4 .",
    "figure 4 shows continuum - normalized regions of the sdss spectra for all three quasars with strong - absorption .",
    "investigations of the possibility of clustering between dlas and lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) have been made at high redshift ( e.g. , gawiser et al .",
    "2001 , aldelberger et al .",
    "2003 , bouch & lowenthal 2003 ) .",
    "gawiser et al . ( 2001 ) and aldelberger et al . ( 2003 ) find no significant evidence for clustering at @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , while bouch & lowenthal ( 2003 ) present weak evidence ( @xmath89 significance ) for clustering at @xmath90 on a size scale up to @xmath91 mpc ( @xmath92 mpc comoving ) .    here",
    "we have reported the discovery of an apparently non - random ( see below ) structure on the sky near redshift @xmath1 (  2.1 ) which is much larger than the scales explored in high - redshift dla - lbg clustering studies and much larger than normal galaxy clustering .",
    "the structure consists of two extremely high-@xmath15 ( even by dla standards ) dla absorbers separated by 13,000 km s@xmath5 along a single quasar sightline .",
    "if interpreted as a cosmological redshift separation , this double - damped structure has a radial proper distance of @xmath74 mpc .",
    "the incidence of dlas above a survey threshold of @xmath24 atoms @xmath4 is @xmath19 per unit redshift at @xmath1 ( rtn2004 ) . given this incidence , the probability of observing a second dla within @xmath93 of another dla is @xmath943% .",
    "we quote this probability as an upper limit because the incidence of dlas is significantly smaller for higher column density systems , and the column densities of the two systems included in the double - damped absorption are factors of @xmath95 and @xmath96 times larger than the survey threshold.@xmath97 therefore , the double - damped absorption may be the result of correlated dlas and be caused by a cosmologically extended filament of neutral gas along our sightline .",
    "in addition to the identification of this remarkable structure , we have made metal abundance determinations for the two systems which make up the double - damped absorption .",
    "we find them to have [ zn / h ] = @xmath9 ( 26.5% solar ) and @xmath98 ( 4.7% solar ) , with evidence for some depletion onto grains in both cases (  2.1 ) .",
    "infrared imaging indicates that the two most likely dla candidate galaxies are relatively faint in relation to the galaxy population at @xmath1 , with @xmath99-band luminosities that are @xmath69 and @xmath70 (  2.2 ) .",
    "these add to the list of underluminous galaxies that have been identified as being responsible for dla absorption ( rao et al .",
    "the results indicate that the presence of luminous galaxies relative to the local population evidently is not a requirement for the presence of large concentrations of neutral gas .",
    "we have also identified two new candidate dla systems in this same region of the sky , separated from the original sightline by 10 arcmin and 25 arcmin (  3 ) .",
    "the discovery of these two additional systems increases the probability that this is a non - random structure .",
    "if the two new redshift systems are included , the structure stretches @xmath85",
    "km s@xmath5 along the sightline , corresponding to a radial proper distance of @xmath100 mpc .    filaments nearly as large as that implied by the double - damped absorption have been seen in mock redshift surveys and cold dark matter simulations of structure formation .",
    "for example , faltenbacher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report correlations in cluster orientations with respect to one another and find alignments of galaxy clusters major axes on comoving scales of @xmath101 mpc , corresponding to a proper distance of @xmath102 mpc at @xmath1 .",
    "the large scale structure simulations of eisenstein , loeb , & turner ( 1997 ) show similar alignments .",
    "recently , palunas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have reported evidence for a structure with a proper size of @xmath103 mpc ( @xmath104 mpc comoving ) , which they found during a search for ly@xmath0-emitting galaxies at @xmath105 .",
    "miller et al . (",
    "2004 ) have reported evidence for structures on even larger scales based on an analysis of the qso distribution in the 2df redshift survey . for this case of double - damped absorption , the size of the putative neutral hydrogen gas filament would be larger than any claimed so far .",
    "therefore , our interpretation should be considered speculative pending future studies . nevertheless , the properties of the double - damped absorption are of course relevant to studies of dlas in general .    the present - day cosmological model ( approximately 73% dark energy , 24% dark matter and 5% ordinary matter , e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) is one in which large - scale structures can form early in time .",
    "however , a specific set of cosmological parameters may also indicate that it is highly improbable for certain structures to grow from initial gaussian perturbations .",
    "thus , surveys to find evidence for extreme large - scale structure at high redshift have the potential to result in important cosmological constraints .",
    "based on the numbers of dlas discovered at low redshift so far and the dla column density distribution , the existence of this double - damped absorption along one sightline represents evidence for a non - random distribution of dlas which should be further investigated .",
    "we thank members of the sdss collaboration who made the sdss project a success and who made the edr spectra available .",
    "we acknowledge support from nasa - stsci , nasa - ltsa , and nsf .",
    "hst - uv spectroscopy made the @xmath15 determinations possible , while follow - up metal abundance measurements ( mmt ) and imaging ( irtf ) were among the aims of our ltsa and nsf programs .",
