    "since the last decade , interest in studying the electrical properties of dna has enhanced considerably as it appears that dna can conduct electrons , and becomes a promising agent for future nanoelectronic devices which can help to overcome the drawbacks like energy efficiency of present silicon - based devices .",
    "not only this , it has many advantageous properties like self - assemble and self - replication which can make it possible to produce nanostructures with greater precision that is not achievable with classical silicon - based technology  @xcite .",
    "the question whether dna or in broad aspect biomolecules can conduct electrons or not , was first addressed by eley and spivey  @xcite in 1962 .",
    "the first effort to use organic molecules as electronic components started also quite early in 1974  @xcite , but the lack of knowledge of electrical properties of dna made the task quite difficult . with time , the advent of new - generation sophisticated techniques and low temperature measurement facilities make it possible to investigate the physical properties of dna and other biomolecules . till date",
    "a large number of studies have been performed on electronic transport properties of dna .",
    "a various number of different techniques have been applied which include measurements on single - stranded dna  @xcite , measurements on oriented dna strands on lipid films  @xcite , measurement on the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics of unordered dna on the nanocontacts  @xcite , and also on artificially made poly(gc ) chains  @xcite . despite these vast efforts",
    "no conclusive results appear , on contrary dna behaves in various modes in electrical conduction , such as an insulator  @xcite , wide - band gap semiconductor  @xcite , ohmic  @xcite , and even proximity - induced superconductor at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "this large variety of experimental results led to various theoretical models in which electrical transport is mediated by polarons  @xcite , solitons  @xcite , electrons and holes  @xcite .",
    "thus electronic transport properties of dna still remain quite debatable and ref .",
    "@xcite provide a vivid review .",
    "while there is so much effort to understand the electrical properties of dna , only mere number of attempts have been made to study its thermal and thermodynamic properties  @xcite .",
    "recently a study  @xcite showed that the knowledge of thermal properties of different biomolecules ( e.g. , polypeptides etc . )",
    "may become helpful in the determination process of different neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimer and parkinson . in our work",
    "we would like to extend the knowledge of thermal properties of dna through study of specific heat in details .",
    "our main aim is to investigate the role of backbones on the electronic specific heat ( esh ) spectra , with the purpose of finding the likeness and dis - likeness among them and to predict some kind of standard behavior .",
    "we model dna within the tight - binding framework , incorporating its backbone structure which was lacking in the previous studies  @xcite , to investigate the effects of the presence of backbones and also of the environment .",
    "we use four dna sequences ranging from periodic , quasi - periodic to random , and see that irrespective of sequences the features of specific heat are similar in the clean case ( no disorder ) and this behaviour prevails even in presence of environmental effects at any particular disorder .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "2 we present the tight - binding hamiltonian and discuss about our theoretical formulation . in sec .",
    "3 we show our numerical results and finally summarize in sec .",
    "to study the esh spectra of dna molecule we use the so - called dangling backbone ladder model ( dblm )  @xcite within the tight - binding framework , as it is more realistic than the simple ladder model since the former one incorporates the backbone structure of dna .",
    "as the sugar - phosphate backbones are negatively charged and form the outer part of the double - helix , they can easily interact with environment and the substrates on which experiments are performed and the backbone site energies get changed randomly  @xcite . therefore by introducing disorder in the backbone site - energies we can incorporate environmental effects into the system which quite well replicate the experimental situations .",
    "the effect of environment on the thermal properties of dna , specially on the specific heat is so far not well - explored , hence for this purpose we use the following tight - binding hamiltonian of the dblm to mimic dna molecule ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )    @xmath0    where , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron creation and annihilation operators at the _ i_th nucleotide at the jth stand , @xmath4 nearest neighbour hopping amplitude between nucleotides along the jth branch of the ladder , @xmath5 on - site energy of the nucleotides , @xmath6 on - site energy of the backbone site adjacent to ith nucleotide of the jth strand with @xmath7 representing the upper and lower strands respectively , @xmath8 hopping amplitude between a nucleotide and the corresponding backbone site , and @xmath9 vertical hopping between nucleotides in the two strands of the ladder . for simplicity , we set @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "to study the electronic specific heat of the dna molecule , we use the most general formalism where the specific heat at constant volume is given by the partial derivative of average energy of the system with respect to temperature @xmath13 where , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average energy of the system , @xmath16 the energy of an electron at the _ i_th eigenstate , @xmath17 is the chemical potential , t is the temperature , @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath19 is the occupation probability of the ith eigenstate according to fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "using the expressions of @xmath15 and @xmath19 we find the following expression for electronic specific heat ( esh ) of dna @xmath20    to explain the esh spectra we also study the electronic density of states ( dos ) of the system .",
    "we use green s function formalism to find dos of the system which is given by @xmath21}\\ ] ] where , @xmath22 is the green s function for the entire dna molecule with electron energy e as @xmath23 , @xmath24 hamiltonian of the dna , and , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively represents imaginary part and trace over the entire hilbert space .",
    "to study the esh of dna , we take four different dna sequences , of which two are periodic , one is random and another is quasi - periodic . in the present work we take fibonacci sequence as a prototype example of a quasiperiodic sequence which is derived using the inflation rule : a@xmath27at , t@xmath27a . in order to investigate the effect of backbone environment",
    ", we first study the simple ladder model without any backbone and then the dangling backbone ladder model , which incorporates the backbone structure . in dblm environmental fluctuations",
    "are incorporated introducing disorder into the backbone sites . to represent the actual experimental situation , in this work",
    "we simulate the environmental fluctuations including also the effect of water environment by distributing the backbone site - energy @xmath28 randomly within the range @xmath29-w@xmath30+w@xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 represents the average backbone site energy and w being the disorder strength . to have a physical insight about the esh of dna we have also evaluated the dos of the four dna sequences as stated earlier for various disorder strengths ( w ) . for numerical calculations",
    "the on - site energies of the nucleotides ( @xmath33 ) are taken as the ionization potential and the following numerical values are used in our work : @xmath34= 8.177 ev , @xmath35= 9.722 ev , @xmath36= 8.631 ev , @xmath37= 9.464 ev .",
    "the intrastrand hopping amplitude between identical neighbouring bases is taken as t= 0.35 ev while that between unlike nucleotides is taken as t= 0.17 ev .",
    "we take interstrand hopping parameter _",
    "i.e. _ , vertical hopping to be v= 0.3 ev . the parameters used here are adopted from the first - principle calculations  @xcite .",
    "the hopping between a nucleotide and corresponding backbone is taken as @xmath38= 0.7 ev  @xcite .",
    "we also set @xmath18=1 .    [",

    "[ fig6 ] we show the variation of @xmath39 with temperature ( t ) for four dna sequences at various backbone disorder strength ( w ) . in all the plots , at low temperature @xmath39 reduces with increasing w while it gets enhanced with w at high temperature as discussed earlier .",
    "the peak of the @xmath39 vs. t curve , which determines the crossover temperature , also decreases and shifts towards the high temperature as we increase disorder strength .",
    "there exists some fluctuations in @xmath39 at low temperature under sufficiently high disorder ( w@xmath405 ) .",
    "earlier this kind of oscillatory behavior of esh was reported by e. l. albuquerque _ et .",
    "@xcite at low temperature for the quasi - periodic sequences only , here we get the same kind of fluctuations for all the sequences at low temperature due to environmental effects .    ) with backbone disorder strength ( w ) . except the fibonacci one",
    "the nature of variation is almost same for all the sequences.,width=230 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the dependence of crossover temperature ( @xmath41 ) ( _ i.e. _ , the temperature at which @xmath39 becomes maximum ) on backbone disorder ( w ) .",
    "it shows that @xmath41 increases monotonically with w , the rate of increase being not uniform everywhere , for all the dna sequences excepting the quasi - periodic fibonacci one .",
    "for fibonacci sequence @xmath41 increases upto a certain disorder strength and then it decreases .",
    "till date thermal properties of dna and other biomolecules are not yet well explored .",
    "we make an attempt to examine the electronic specific heat response of dna by modelling it by the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "though there are some results available in the literature on dna specific heat  @xcite , but they did not take into account the backbones being a very basic structure of the dna molecules . in this work",
    "we make an attempt to study the effect backbone and also the effect of the environment on the electronic specific heat of dna .",
    "it comes out that the introduction of backbones make drastic changes in the dos profile , the band structure of the system splits up opening a gap in the central region of the band . due to the formation of this gap specific heat",
    "gets enhanced in presence of backbones over the entire temperature range excepting a narrow low temperature region . on environmental fluctuations , @xmath39 exhibits two distinct behaviours , at low temperature it decreases with backbone disorder strength ( w ) and in the high temperature region it increases with w.",
    "we have also seen that the cross - over temperature ( @xmath41 ) which corresponds to the maximum of the specific heat vs temperature curve increases with disorder ( w ) . in this way we have been able to put forward a regularized behavior of the esh of dna being independent of the sequence we have chosen .",
    "the effect of environmental fluctuations on esh is quite universal both for the clean case ( w=0 ) and also in presence of environmental disorder .",
    "it implies that esh of the system reacts to the environment in the same way irrespective of its sequential variety . in order to verify our predictions experimentally , heat exchange in the process of protein binding , unfolding",
    ", ligand association and other bimolecular reactions should be measured with much more reliability .",
    "there are three basic techniques used for this measurements , the differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) which measures sample heat capacity with respect to a reference as a function of temperature , isothermal titration calorimetry ( itc ) which measures the heat absorbed or rejected during a titration experiment and the third one is thermodynamic calorimetry ( for a detail description see ref .",
    "but unfortunately none of these techniques is able to separate the electronic contribution to the specific heat of biomolecules , as they measure all contributions including the vibrational ones .",
    "however , we hope that there will be experimental verification of our results and other investigations to find thermal properties of dna and alike biomolecules in near future with modifications of the above mentioned tools .",
    "if we take the temperature dependence of chemical potential explicitly into account then the expression of specific heat becomes"
