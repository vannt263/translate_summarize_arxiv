    "stellar clusters are important tools of galactic astronomy because they enable measurements of the location and the motion of spiral arms , of the galactic rotation curve , and of variations of metallicity across the galaxy .",
    "clusters also are excellent laboratories for testing stellar evolution predictions because they are ensembles of coevally formed stars that span a range of stellar masses .",
    "our understanding of stellar clusters can be used to provide constraints for models of stellar evolutionary stages of massive stars ( m@xmath3@xmath4 ) , e.g.wolf-rayet ( wr ) stars , blue supergiants ( bsgs ) , yellow supergiants ( ysgs ) , and red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "massive stars are of particular interest since they are not only supernovae progenitors , but are also among the brightest stars in external galaxies , and contribute to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "massive stars are typically found only in massive young stellar clusters ( m@xmath5 @xmath6 ) due to their short life span and to the steep initial mass function .",
    "the current census of galactic young stellar clusters is highly incomplete beyond a few kiloparcsec from the sun because of interstellar extinction .",
    "so far , clusters have been detected that reside in the near side of the galaxy , with a few exceptions , e.g. w49 @xcite .",
    "we probably know only about 5% of the young clusters .",
    "we expect about 50,000 stellar clusters over the entire galactic plane when considering the population of 1700 clusters optically detected , which are mostly within 3 kpc from the sun @xcite , and assuming a uniform distribution over a disk of 17 kpc .",
    "@xcite provide us with the most complete compilation of known clusters detected at optical wavelength .",
    "a study of the completeness of cluster detections , and cluster parameters , is , however , missing . using the cluster density derived by @xcite with the smaller , but homogeneous , list of 500 clusters in the solar neighbor @xcite we infer a similar total number of clusters .",
    "only a dozen clusters with a mass larger than m@xmath5@xmath7 are known @xcite . from this number ,",
    "we extrapolate 200 clusters with masses m@xmath5@xmath8 by assuming a power law with an index @xmath9 as a cluster mass function .",
    "this small fraction of known clusters may not be representative of the whole sample .",
    "infrared searches for clusters in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite and the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) @xcite have resulted in 1500 additional new candidate clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many candidate clusters could be spurious detections due to the patchiness of interstellar extinction ; some apparent over - density in stellar counts may simply correspond to low extinction regions .",
    "@xcite point out that only 50% of their detections are likely to be real .",
    "deep near - infrared photometry and spectroscopy are needed to confirm candidate clusters .    clearly , we need to improve the census of clusters in the milky way , as well as confirm new candidate clusters",
    ". then we will be able to address several issues concerning the galactic cluster population , such as the cluster initial mass function , the dynamical evolution of young clusters into globular clusters , and the paucity of stellar clusters within 3 kpc from the galactic center .    in this paper ,",
    "we analyze near - infrared spectroscopic observations of two stellar clusters , number # 20 and # 13 from the list of candidate clusters detected by @xcite in glimpse images , and of a new cluster , which we also detected in glimpse images .",
    "hereafter we refer to cluster # 20 of mercer et al . as glimpse20 , and to cluster # 13 as glimpse13 .",
    "we name the new cluster `` the quartet '' , because it is characterized by a tight grouping of 4 mid - infrared bright stars .",
    "this work presents the massive stellar content of these three clusters based on spectroscopic findings and existing 2mass data .",
    "a more detailed study of each individual cluster will be presented in future papers .",
    "we describe observations and data reduction in section 2 , and spectral classification in section 3 .",
    "we present an analysis and discussion of the quartet cluster in section 4 , of glimpse20 in section 5 , and of glimpse13 in section 6 .",
    "section 7 contains a summary and discussion .",

    "we selected candidate clusters from the list of @xcite by searching glimpse images for small groupings of bright stars with no associated nebulosity .",
    "in addition , we included a new cluster , the quartet , that we discovered while inspecting glimpse images .",
    "the observed targets are listed in table [ obs.list ] .",
    "we obtained near - infrared spectra of the brightest stars in the clusters ( table [ table.targets ] ) with the sofi spectrograph at the eso ntt on july 4 , 2007 .",
    "we first used the instrument in imaging mode to acquire the field and position the target into the slit .",
    "then , we adjusted the slit orientation to maximize the number of observed stars . typically , we extracted three or four spectra per slit .",
    "the integration time ranged from 10 to 180 s in _ k@xmath12_-band and from 10 to 240 s in -band .",
    "spectra , taken with a long - slit ( 1@xmath13 ) , have a resolving power r@xmath141320 in the _ k@xmath12_-band ( from 2.0 to 2.31 @xmath15 m ) and r@xmath14900 in the -band ( from 1.4 to 1.8 @xmath15 m ) .",
    "we observed two stars with _ k@xmath12_@xmath16 mag ( glimpse13 # 1 and glimpse20 # 1 ) with a narrow slit ( 0.6@xmath13 ) , boosting the resolution up by a factor of 1.67 . for each star and filter",
    ", we obtained four spectra in an abba sequence by nodding the telescope along the slit between exposures . during the second half of the night",
    ", clouds hampered our observations , so only _ k@xmath12_-band spectra were taken .",
    "data was reduced with the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software .",
    "we removed the sky by subtracting pairs of subsequent images , and flat - fielded the images using a combined set of dark - subtracted dome flats .",
    "we extracted the individual spectra using an aperture of 10 pixels ( @xmath1788 ) , and subtracted sky residuals using the average value of regions selected on both sides of the aperture .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated using arc observations .",
    "finally , we combined the four spectra of each source .",
    "stars of spectral types g1v and g2v were observed close to the airmass of the program stars as telluric standards ; their spectra were taken , and reduced in the same manner as those of the target stars .",
    "we divided the reference spectra by a solar spectrum to obtain a combined instrumental and atmospheric response function . in the -band , the use of g - type stars as telluric standards resulted in a non - optimal correction ( residuals are stronger between 1.55 and 1.65 @xmath15 m ) .",
    "this is because spectra of g - type stars have intrinsic features at @xmath18 % of the continuum level .",
    "to perform a spectral classification , we compared the spectra of the detected stars with -band and -band spectral atlases ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , as well as in the -band ( e.g. lines from mg i , al i , oh , and second - overtone co band heads are detected , * ? ? ? * ) . k and m type stars are easy to identify because of their deep co band head absorption at 2.29 @xmath15 m .",
    "the co absorption strength increases with : decreasing effective temperature , and increasing luminosity @xcite . the h@xmath19o absorption ( at 1.351.5 , 1.72.1 , 2.7 @xmath15 m ) increases with decreasing temperature , and decreasing luminosity .",
    "water absorption is a distinctive feature of pulsating variable giants , while almost absent in static giants and in rsgs .",
    "we estimated effective temperatures of late type stars following the method of @xcite , i.e.   by comparing the measurements of equivalent widths of the co band head at 2.29 @xmath15 m  with those of template stars @xcite .",
    "* early - type stars : * early - type stars can be identified by the detection of hydrogen ( h ) and helium ( he ) lines . several metal lines are also detected at infrared wavelengths : for example , the civ triplet at 2.069 , 2.078 , and 2.083 @xmath15 m ; and the broad emission feature found at 2.116 @xmath15 m , identified as n iii or ciii emission @xcite .",
    "wr stars are also rich in nitrogen and carbon lines @xcite .",
    "we used the ratio between the emission line at 2.11@xmath15 m   ( ciii+hei ) and the civ line at 2.08 @xmath15 m   to classify carbon rich wr stars .",
