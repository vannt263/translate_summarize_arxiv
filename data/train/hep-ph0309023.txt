    "neglecting quark masses , @xmath1 is the only free parameter of qcd , the theory of strong interaction .",
    "thus its measurement is a task of fundamental importance . additionally , the scale dependence of the strong coupling , as governed by the @xmath3 function , is among the important predictions of qcd .",
    "this note presents both , a measurements of @xmath1 at different lep2 energies , and a test of the scale dependence of the strong interaction . in both cases",
    "several techniques are applied .    from the event",
    "shapes thrust , c parameter , heavy jet mass , wide and total jet broadening , @xmath1  is extracted with four different methods : the differential distributions at each energy are compared to predictions in @xmath4(@xmath5 ) , pure nlla and matched @xmath4(@xmath5)+nlla , folded with fragmentation models .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1  is extracted from the mean values using an analytical power correction ansatz .",
    "these measurements , together with the results from other lep2 energies and about @xmath2 , are finally combined into one @xmath1   measurement for each method .",
    "the @xmath3 function is extracted with two different techniques : from the @xmath1  values directly , and from the energy evolution of mean values of event shapes .",
    "the last method is based on the renormalisation group invariant ( rgi ) perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these analyses and the theoretical background are described in more detail in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the analysis is based on data taken with the delphi detector in the years from 1997 to 2000 at centre of mass energies between 183 and 207 .",
    "details on the delphi detector and the event selection can be found in @xcite and the references therein . in total",
    "a number of @xmath610.000 hadronic events have been analyses .",
    "this is less than 1% of the statistics gathered at @xmath7 .",
    "but not only the cross section at lep2 is much smaller than at lep1 .",
    "additionally one has to deal with significant background processes .",
    "most important are radiative ( isr ) events and the production of w pairs ( four fermion events ) .",
    "for details we refer again to @xcite .",
    "from the differential distributions of 1-t , c parameter , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath1  is determined by fitting an @xmath1  dependent qcd prediction folded with a hadronisation correction to the data . as qcd predictions @xmath4(@xmath5 ) , pure nlla , and the combined @xmath4(@xmath5)+nlla in @xmath11-scheme are employed .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that fixing the renormalisation scale to @xmath12 results in a marginal description of the data .",
    "therefore , the experimentally optimised scales from @xcite are used for the @xmath4(@xmath5 )  fits . for the nlla and the combined nlla+@xmath4(@xmath5)fits ,",
    "@xmath13 is set equal to @xmath14 .",
    "all perturbative qcd predictions introduce uncertainties due to missing higher orders .",
    "the conventional method for its estimation is to consider the effect of a renormalisation scale variation .",
    "this method however has at least two drawbacks : since the scale error is positively correlated with @xmath1 , this definition produces a bias towards small @xmath1 values . secondly there are indications , that observables calculated from one hemisphere only ( like the heavy jet mass or @xmath9 ) yield less reliable results in the resummation of leading logarithms @xcite .",
    "this should be reflected in their theoretical errors . in",
    "contrary the scale variation yields the _ smallest _ uncertainty for the heavy jet mass and especially @xmath15 . for this reason a new definition of the theoretical uncertainty for the logr prediction was developed .",
    "it is based on the additional ambiguity which enters the resumed prediction from the phase space restriction .",
    "these calculations are forced to vanish at the kinematic limit @xmath16 using the replacement : @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] usually @xmath18 is chosen , although different values for this @xmath19 scale introduce formally only subdominant contributions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical error is now defined as half of the difference when @xmath19 is varied between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the same definition of the theoretical uncertainty has been adopted for the pure nlla prediction .    for the @xmath4(@xmath5 )",
    "calculation the error from the variation around the experimentally optimized scales is still used , as in previous publications @xcite .    in order to avoid the above",
    "mentioned bias , the corresponding scale variations are calculated from theory distributions with a fixed value of @xmath1 .      for a combination of the @xmath1 results from different observables at the same energy a proper treatment of the correlation is mandatory .",
    "an average value @xmath22 for correlated measurements @xmath23 is : @xmath24 the covariance matrix @xmath25 has an additive structure for each source of uncertainty : @xmath26 the statistical component was estimated with monte carlo simulation , while the correlation of systematic errors is modeled by the minimum overlap assumption : @xmath27 here @xmath28 denotes the corresponding error of the observable @xmath29 .",
    "the analytical power ansatz is used to determine @xmath1  from mean event shapes .",
    "this ansatz provides an additive term to the perturbative @xmath4(@xmath5 )  qcd prediction @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 here an additional non  perturbative parameter @xmath31  enters for the contributions to the event shape below an infrared matching scale @xmath32 .",
    "in order to measure @xmath1  from individual high energy data the parameter @xmath31has to be determined by a global fit of @xmath1  and @xmath31  to a large set of measurements at different energies .",
    "assuming the validity of the qcd predicted energy dependence of @xmath1 , all results can be evolved to a reference energy , e.g. @xmath33 , and combined to a single @xmath1@xmath34 measurement .",
    "we include also the lep2 results at 133 , 161 and 172  from @xcite . for @xmath1  at and around @xmath33",
    "we have reanalyzed the distributions from @xcite for our five observables and combined the results using the same treatment of correlation as described in section [ combi ] . for @xmath1  from mean values",
    "the measurements of events with reduced centre  of  mass energy between 44 and 76  @xcite have been included as well . in combining the @xmath1",
    "results one faces again the problem of correlation .",
    "although the measurements at different energies are obviously statistically independent , the systematic and theoretical errors are not . again",
    "this part of the covariance matrix was modeled assuming minimum overlap .",
    "the only difference to the method described in section [ combi ] is , that the error of isr and four fermion background correlates only those measurements which have this source of uncertainty in common .",
    "the result of these combinations are given in table [ final_tab ] .",
    "as an example the figures [ bildchen_as ] and [ run ] display the combination and energy evolution of the @xmath1 values from the @xmath35 fit to distributions and from mean values with power corrections respectively .    as can be seen from table [ final_tab ]",
    "the total errors are dominated by the theoretical uncertainty .",
    ".[final_tab ] results of combining all delphi @xmath1  measurements at lep1 and lep2 .",
    "the quoted errors are the experimental ( stat . and sys.exp . ) and theoretical ( scale and hadronisation ) ones .",

    "the @xmath3 functions governs not only the scale dependence of @xmath1 , but directly the energy evolution of e.g. event shapes . in the renormalisation group invariant ( rgi )",
    "perturbation theory @xcite the energy evolution of fully inclusive quantities @xmath36 , like mean values of event shape distributions , can be used to measure the @xmath3 function directly : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the first order coefficient when expanding @xmath36 in powers of @xmath41 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , that this approach yields consistent results for various observables .",
    "however , the highest accuracy can be achieved for the observable @xmath42 , since here the most low energy data is available .",
