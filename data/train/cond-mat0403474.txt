    "recently granular gases , i.e. a large number of macroscopic particles colliding with one another and losing a little energy at each collision , have been studied employing methods of statistical physics.@xcite the main practical motivation to improve the understanding of the dynamical and static properties of these materials stems from their relevance in a variety of technological and industrial processes.@xcite granular materials also represent a new paradigm in the context of non equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "in fact , they are open systems which can reach a non equilibrium stationary state when the energy loss , determined by the dissipative interactions , is balanced by the work supplied by an external driving force .",
    "a current problem in this field , motivated by a series of recent experiments and theoretical work , concerns the behavior of driven granular gases subject to spatially non uniform conditions.@xcite these conditions can be realized experimentally by shaking the gas in a container divided in a series of identical compartments connected by holes .",
    "the following phenomenology is observed : for strong shaking intensity the grains jump from one compartment to the other , whereas for weak shaking intensity , they tend to break the discrete symmetry of the system and fill preferentially only some compartments . such a clustering occurs because the grains , unlike an ideal gas of molecules , can dissipate heat when colliding . therefore a spontaneous increase of the number of particles within a given compartment entails more collisions and a consequent higher energy loss .",
    "thus the capability for the particles to leave the compartment is strongly inhibited leading eventually to clustering .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a simple modeling of the multi - compartment experiment , namely a one dimensional system of inelastic hard rods  @xcite driven by a stochastic thermostat and subject to an external time - independent periodic potential . as shown in our recent paper,@xcite the one dimensional geometry of the model not only",
    "minimizes the amount of computational effort , but also allows performing analytical guesses concerning the relevant observables .    as a premise , we recall that in the case of elastic hard - rods coupled to a stochastic heat bath and in the presence of a periodic external potential most of the equilibrium properties can be computed by using of an exact functional relation , proved by percus,@xcite between an arbitrary external potential and the equilibrium average density profile .",
    "it is natural to ask how the behavior of the elastic system will be affected upon switching on the inelasticity of the collisions .",
    "the equilibrium state of the elastic hard - rod system is replaced by a corresponding non equilibrium steady state of the inelastic system .",
    "the comparison between the properties of the two systems offers a useful procedure to understand the interplay between the inelasticity , the excluded volume effect and the external potential .",
    "as we shall see below the model shows a variety of non equilibrium states according to the values of the control parameters , such as the external potential , the density and the driving force .",
    "these states range from spatially periodic configurations to non periodic configurations in agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model we employed to study the effects of compartments in granular gases and we briefly discuss the main feature of the dynamics . in section iii , we compare the steady state properties of the model against the corresponding properties of the equilibrium elastic system . in section iv , we consider the relaxation and clustering properties of the system . finally , conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "the main issue of the present paper is to study how the properties of a granular fluidized system are affected by the presence of a static external non uniform potential .",
    "we will show that such a confining potential can enhance the tendency toward cluster formation , generating inhomogeneities similar to those observed in some real granular systems placed in compartments .",
    "the model studied consists of a set of @xmath0 impenetrable particles of equal masses , @xmath1 , and lengths , @xmath2 , moving on a ring under the influence of the periodic potential @xmath3 .",
    "two mechanisms control the energy of the particles : the interaction with an heat bath and the collisions among the particles .",
    "the collisions are instantaneous and binary and dissipate a fraction @xmath4 of the total kinetic energy of the pair ( @xmath5 being the coefficient of restitution ) .",
    "the heat bath , instead , supplies an amount of energy which prevents the system to come at rest . in this paper",
    "we employ , a stochastic energy source , namely the thermostat previously employed in refs .",
    "[ ] . the coupling of the particles to the heat - bath consists of the combination of a velocity dependent frictional force and a random kick .",
    "we first write the evolution equation for the generic particle @xmath6 in the system when the collisions are not taken into account : @xmath7 where , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate the position of particle @xmath6 , the friction coefficient and the spatial derivative of the external static potential , respectively .",
    "the kicks , @xmath12 , are distributed according to a gaussian law characterized by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the temperature @xmath15 determines the intensity of the heat bath .",
    "the external potential has a spatial period @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the system size and @xmath18 is the number of potential wells ( i.e. number of local minima ) in the interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "each well mimics , in our simulation , a compartment in lohse s experiments.@xcite the boundary conditions are assumed to be periodic .",
    "we found that a rather convenient potential to use in numerical experiment is that of refs .",
    "[ ] : @xmath20 where the zeroth - order modified bessel function,@xcite @xmath21 , in the denominator , enforces the normalization condition @xmath22 .",
    "the shape of the potential @xmath3 depends upon the parameter @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_poten ] ) : as it increases , the shape of the barriers become more square - like , approximating the condition of walls .",
    "collisions redistribute the energy and the momenta among the particles . for a nearest neighbor pair",
    "a collision event takes place when the separation @xmath24 equals their length , @xmath2 and determines a change of the velocities of the two particles according to the rule : @xmath25 where the prime indicates post - collisional variables .",
    "notice that in the elastic case , @xmath26 , the collisions do not change the total energy and that the average kinetic energy per particle attains asymptotically the value @xmath15 .",
    "this state of affairs is altered for values of the coefficient of restitution less than one and the average kinetic energy per particle reaches ( for @xmath27 ) a value smaller than @xmath15 .    in the following",
    "we will assume a unitary mass @xmath28 .     for @xmath29 , as @xmath23 increases ,",
    "the barriers approximate the condition of walls and the wells become more square - like . ]    the basic phenomenology of the inelastic model can be understood by considering the two competing effects controlling the dynamics : the hard core interaction and the collisional dissipation .",
    "the former favors the equidistribution of the particles in the various wells , whereas the latter promotes the formation of clusters in some wells , thus breaking the periodic symmetry of the system .",
    "if the particles were independent , the passage from one well to the next would occur via an activated jump process , characterized by a typical exit time , @xmath30 , proportional to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the energy barrier between adjacent wells .",
    "in other words , a local density excess of particles would be washed out by a diffusive process whose diffusion constant , @xmath33 , has the arrhenius dependence , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 . in a recent paper  @xcite we have shown that , in a granular toy model consisting of two wells and only two particles , two different jump processes can be clearly identified : the free - jump , which occurs when the escape is from a singly occupied well , and the correlated - jump that occurs when the escape involves a doubly occupied well .",
    "the resulting scenario is that the jumping dynamics remains still arrhenius - like but the jump - rate strongly depends on the occupation of the well from which the jump occurs , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 indicates the occupation number ( @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) . in the multi - well and many particle systems",
    ", we shall discuss hereafter , the phenomenon is enhanced and the escape rate for a given well will depend on the number of particle inside that well .",

    "in this section we focus our attention on the clustering process which occurs spontaneously , starting from a uniform configuration , when the temperature of the heat bath is comparable with the energy of the potential barriers .",
    "since the collisional cooling determines a decrease of the local temperature in the regions of high density , some compartments , randomly selected by the dynamics , may act as germs for the nucleation of a clustering process .",

    "as time goes on , we record the density , @xmath156 , of particles escaping from the well and average it over an ensemble of @xmath157 randomly selected initial configurations .",
    "the averaging procedure yields a curve @xmath158 from which we estimate its time derivative numerically .",
    "finally , a parametric plot of @xmath159 versus the density of the remaining particles in the well , @xmath160 , gives the flux function @xmath161 of the model .",
    "it is instructive to compare the properties of the flux relative to three different systems : non interacting , elastically colliding and inelastically colliding particles , as shown in figure  [ fig : flux ] .    , @xmath130 , @xmath147 , well size @xmath162 ( barrier @xmath163 ) , bath temperature @xmath164 and coefficient of restitution @xmath76 .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the flux described in the appendix is the dot - dashed plot .",
    "the inset reports the same curves on a larger scale.,width=302 ]    in the low density limit the interactions are almost negligible and the flux functions display a linear behaviors characterized by a common slope .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting when the well contains more particles .",
    "the flux for non - interacting particles grows linearly with @xmath151 ( dashed curve ) : the larger @xmath151 , the larger is the probability to observe an escape event . while , in the system of elastic hard particles , the hard - core potential produces two competing effects : on one hand the repulsion makes the escape rate for particles near the border of the well larger than the corresponding rate for non - interacting particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the same repulsion induces a cage effect entrapping the inner particles and tends to reduce the escape rate .",
    "however , from the dot - dashed curve in the inset of figure  [ fig : flux ] , we see that the first effect overcomes the second enhancing the flux with respect to independent particles .",
    "finally , in the inelastic case , the tendency of the particles to form clusters and to dissipate kinetic energy greatly decreases the exit probability from the well , so that the flux is much smaller ( almost two orders of magnitude ) than the flux for the independent and elastic systems .",
    "we observe a slow increase with @xmath151 and a local maximum clearly visible in dot curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] .",
    "the dot - dashed line , in the same figure , represents instead the theoretical attempt to explain the behaviour of @xmath161 through a kramers theory which combines the excluded volume effect and the inelasticity into the escape - time formula  ( [ newkramer ] ) ( see appendix ) .",
    "the theoretical curve is plotted for all the same parameters of the simulations except for a unknown prefactor which is used as a fitting coefficient .",
    "in this paper , inspired by a series of recent experiments , we have introduced and studied a model of randomly driven inelastic hard rods in the presence of an external spatially periodic potential .",
    "the one dimensional model presents some of the salient features of higher dimensional models , such as packing , clustering , velocity correlations.@xcite by comparison with the elastic hard rod model , used here as reference system , we found that the inelasticity has deep repercussions on the configurational properties .",
    "the fluctuations in density result increased and show the tendency of the system to cluster . moreover",
    ", the ( granular ) temperature profile ceases to be spatially uniform showing minima in correspondence of the density maxima . as a measure the density fluctuations we have introduced an `` entropic '' indicator , @xmath111 , which provides information about the statistics of the partition of the grains in the various wells .",
    "we also performed numerical experiments concerning the stability of a cluster obtained by initially concentrating all the particles in a single well . finally , we considered within the model the shape of the flux function which plays a major role in the macroscopic description of compartmentalized systems .",

    "in this appendix we present a theoretical argument to explain the behaviour of flux function @xmath165 measured in simulations .",
    "the flux of particles outside of a potential well , with size @xmath166 , height @xmath167 and populated with a density @xmath151 , can be computed via the formula @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the particle escape time across the barrier . for the present granular system",
    ", this time follows the kramers - arrhenius law for independent particles , but with parameters renormalized by interactions . as already mentioned , @xmath169 is the outcome of two competing effects , the excluded volume and the granular dissipation .",
    "the dissipation determines the granular temperature that can be approximated by the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tg ] ) , which holds only for a inelastic system without external potential .",
    "however for the potential parameters chosen in our simulations , formula  ( [ eq : tg ] ) can be considered a fair approximation of the temperature in a well , because wells are rather flat and barriers so steep that particles feel the confining effect of the potential only in the neighborhood of well boundaries ( fig.[fig : example ] ) .",
    "the excluded volume interaction , instead , is responsible for a mean reduction of the potential barrier @xmath167 .",
    "this effect is pictorially illustrated in figure [ fig : example ] , where the leftmost / rightmost particles ( darker ) , the only ones allowed to jump , are displaced from the well center @xmath170 of an amount @xmath171 .",
    "they experience an effective energy - barrier roughly estimated as @xmath172 and the renormalized arrhenius law becomes @xmath173 simulations indicate a very weak dependence of @xmath174 on @xmath151 for the parameters we employed .",
    "therefore , the prefactor @xmath175 has been considered as a adjustable time scale .",
    "numerical solutions of equation  ( [ eq : tg ] ) computed at different densities allow to construct the curve of the flux @xmath165 as a function of @xmath151 , reported in figure [ fig : flux ] in dot - dashed style .",
