    "the discovery of the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) recurrence was a significant step in nonlinear dynamics .",
    "it describes the natural return cycle of a dynamical system to its initial conditions after undergoing complex motion dynamics @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the fpu recurrence has been studied and observed in several nonlinear media .",
    "for instance , in hydrodynamics within the framework of the korteweg de vries @xcite equations as well as in a more broad range in physics within the context of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite , particularly , in the description of modulationally unstable periodic packets returning to the initial state of small perturbation of the background after significant envelope compression @xcite . in fiber optics , experimental observations of the fpu recurrence",
    "have been also restricted to one or two cycles @xcite .",
    "more recently , the effects of different perturbations to the standard nlse such as third - order dispersion or varying dispersion , or even the impact of initial excitation of modulation instability , on the fpu phenomenon have been reported as well @xcite .    here",
    ", we show that the impact of weak dissipation engenders shifted fpu recurrence in the localizations of periodic breathers .",
    "the results are in very good agreement with laboratory experiments , which have been performed in a super water wave tank . due to the interdisciplinary character of the approach",
    ", this study emphasizes a wide range of applications in other nonlinear dispersive media , as will be discussed .",
    "the nlse is one of the most significant equations in physics .",
    "it describes waves on the surface of the ocean , pulses in optical fibres , special states of bose - einstein condensates , plasma oscillations and many other phenomena .",
    "the nlse can be written in dimensionless form as : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 describes the spatial co - ordinate , moving with the group velocity , while @xmath2 denotes the scaled time and @xmath3 the scaled envelope amplitude . among elementary solutions of the nlse are plane waves , solitons , breathers and rational solutions @xcite .",
    "breathers can be considered as heteroclinic orbits connecting two saddle points in an infinite - dimensional phase space .",
    "the latter are plane wave solutions that are modulationally unstable .",
    "saddle points are usually surrounded by nearby trajectories that are connected to similar trajectories around the second saddle point . as a result ,",
    "homoclinic orbits are surrounded by the periodic trajectories and corresponding solutions of the nlse @xcite .",
    "one of such periodic solution of the nlse has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 } { \\mbox{dn } \\left [ \\sqrt{(1+\\kappa)/2}\\tau,~\\sqrt{(1-\\kappa)/(1+\\kappa ) } \\right ] } \\ ] ] and @xmath6 is a free parameter of this family of solutions .",

    "the latter can be found in @xcite .",
    "as @xmath18 , the solution ( [ per ] ) has formula ( [ mxr ] ) as its limit . as solutions ( [ per ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) are located on different sides of the separatrix ( [ mxr ] ) .",
    "they are qualitatively different .",
    "the solution ( [ per ] ) keeps maxima of the periodic function at the same position while the solution ( [ 45 ] ) has maxima alternating .",
    "the latter can be considered as phase - shifting solutions .",
    "this difference can be seen clearly by comparing fig .",
    "[ perd2 ] with fig .",
    "[ perd1 ] .    the geometric interpretation of two types of periodic solutions is presented in fig . [ evol ] .",
    "the circle with unit radius shown by the dashed line can be considered as a plane wave with unit amplitude and variable phase .",
    "each point of the circle is an unstable saddle point .",
    "the starting trajectories of the saddle point describe benjamin - feir or modulation instability ( mi ) .",
    "let us choose one of them located , say , at the upper point of the circle .",
    "continuation of the trajectory that starts at the saddle point ends up at another saddle point located at the bottom of the circle .",
    "this particular trajectory describes the akhmediev breather ( [ mxr ] ) .",
    "this trajectory is a heteroclinic orbit separating two trajectories denoted as a and b corresponding to periodic solutions ( [ per ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "trajectory a rotates on one side of the complex plane and does not shift the phase while trajectory b rotates around the origin thus gaining the phase difference @xmath19 on each period of oscillations .",
    ", i.e. @xmath20 . the dotted lines schematically show two qualitatively different types of periodic solution close to the separatrix .",
    "the curves labelled a correspond to solution ( [ 45 ] ) , while curve b corresponds to ( [ per ] ) . ]",
    "these two types of solutions can be observed in experiments that start with modulation instability . in the presence of even small perturbations , the separatrix may be converted into a nearby periodic orbit of either type a or type b depending on the sign of the perturbation . in the experiments that are described in the present work , the dissipation played the role of the perturbation .",
    "an interesting point here is the fact that despite the dissipation always has the same sign , the perturbation it causes can be either positive or negative .",
    "consequently , the trajectory could be converted either to type a or type b during the evolution .",
    "these two scenarios can be easily detected experimentally observing the phase shift .",
    "+ we confirm the occurrence of this interesting phenomenon in numerical simulations and validate the results through hydrodynamic laboratory experiments conducted in a large wave facility permitting the measurement of several stages of envelope compressions .",
    "namely , we reveal that deviations from exact ab envelope dynamics caused by non - ideal excitation or propagation losses imply the emergence of successive spatial recurrences as shown in figs .",
    "[ perd1 ] and [ perd2 ] .",

    "the growth rate becomes algebraic and the solution reduces to a rational doubly - localized solution , known as the peregrine solution @xcite .",
    "the latter breather solutions attracted scientific interest recently @xcite and had been observed in several nonlinear systems @xcite . solutions ( [ ab ] ) are of significant importance in understanding the modulation instability as well as for a wide range of applications , since they exactly and physically describe the complete growth - decay cycle of modulation instability , quantifying in detail the side - band cascade dynamics @xcite .",

    "( b ) corresponding trajectory in the complex plane .",
    "the red crosses correspond to numerical simulations , while the blue curve is given by the exact analytical expression ( [ ab ] ) . ]",
    "small perturbation of the initial conditions engenders the recurrent breathing of ab envelopes .",
    "the trajectory misses exact saddle point and continues along the hyperbolic orbit .",
    "this results in the next recurrent dynamics which then continues into periodic motion@xcite .",
    "an example of two successive recurrences is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) when approximate initial conditions are used in the numerical simulation . here",
    "the theoretical ab profile at @xmath33 was fitted by a simple cosine modulation of the background wave with same frequency and amplitude .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     clearly , the breather recurrent cycles can be observed in agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "this proves the orbit jump @xcite , as shown in fig . [ fig5](c ) .",
    "in order to confirm the influence of dissipation in engendering recurrent shifted localized envelopes , we performed another set of experiments , however , for different carrier and ab parameters , respectively . in the following we set the amplitude to be @xmath34 m , the steepness to be @xmath35 and the ab parameter @xmath36 , while the dissipation rate is in this case @xmath37 .",
    "all these chosen parameters are beyond breaking thresholds of the unstable waves , and the parameter @xmath38 is below the threshold of higher order modulation instability @xcite . the evolution of the wave envelope is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8](c ) .",
    "the corresponding numerical damped nlse simulations of both latter observations are shown in fig . [ fig8](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig8](d ) respectively .",
    "again , we can here clearly observe the @xmath39-phase shift in each cycle of envelope compression . in both cases ,",
    "numerical simulations are indeed in strong agreement .",
    "we have shown that weak dissipation may engender specific phase - shifted cycles of @xmath39 in the evolution of periodic modulationally unstable waves , described by ab . in fact , we discussed the effect of dissipation on the orbit jumps in the complex phase space .",
    "the numerical results starting from exact ab initial conditions have been validated by laboratory experiments , conducted in super tank for different set of breather and background parameters .",
    "we predict that this novel phenomena , we refer to as phase - shifted fpu recurrence , will motivate a wide range of applications , due to the multidisciplinary nature of the problem , since the nlse , accurately models the dynamics of hydrodynamic , electromagnetic as well as plasma waves .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the observation of many breathing cycles is a very challenging task , in particular to study the effect of perturbations on fpu recurrence without the impact of propagation losses . indeed , overcoming experimental restrictions in hydrodynamics , such as the dissipation or the nonlinear length to name a few , is not something obvious , even for other physical systems . for instance , breather waves have also been intensively studied in optical fibers , but limited to 1 or 2 cycles of recurrence due to the typical normalized dissipation rate @xmath40 estimated about @xmath41 ( for typical parameters smf-28 optical fiber and 1-w continuous wave power @xcite ) .",
    "this clearly points out both the extreme importance of the hydrodynamic results reported here and capabilities of the super wave tank compared to nonlinear optics . to go beyond the frontier in terms of testing nonlinear wave theory",
    ", it clearly requires to overcome the current limitations of real physical systems .",
