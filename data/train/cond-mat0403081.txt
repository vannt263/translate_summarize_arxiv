    "large ensembles of coupled dynamical systems are a basic tool for the study of emergent collective behaviour in systems of interacting agents @xcite .",
    "self - organization in spatially distributed ensembles is revealed by the appearance of spatiotemporal structures , which may exhibit complex evolution . instead , coupled ensembles for which space is not relevant to the dynamical laws become organized in temporal patterns , typically , in some form of synchronous evolution .",
    "much attention has been focused on synchronization phenomena over the last years @xcite .",
    "they have been identified in a broad class of natural and artificial systems , and many of them have been successfully explained by means of relatively simple models .",
    "the degree of collective organization in a coupled ensemble , measured by the correlation between individual motions , varies considerably between different kinds of synchronization patterns .",
    "most studies on these phenomena have dealt with patterns of highly correlated evolution , such as full and phase synchronization . indeed , these forms of synchronization are essential to the functioning of some artificial systems , and have been observed in certain insect populations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", they are expected to play a less relevant role in most biological systems , where the complexity of collective functions requires a delicate balance between coherence and diversity @xcite .",
    "consider , for instance , the brain , where highly coherent activity patterns are only realized under pathological states , such as during epileptic seizures .",
    "many biological systems consisting of interacting agents , ranging from biomolecular complexes to social populations , are normally found in configurations where the ensemble is segregated into groups with specific functions . while the evolution of individual elements is highly correlated inside each group , the collective dynamics of different groups is much more independent .",
    "clustering has been modeled by means of coupled ensembles with specific individual dynamics or interactions @xcite .",
    "usually , clustering is a dynamical process , where groups may preserve their identity in spite of the fact that single elements are continuously migrating between them .",
    "intermittent formation of clusters and migration of elements has been observed under the action of noise @xcite .",
    "the individual motion towards or away from clusters may also be controlled by the internal state of each element , which favors or inhibits grouping with other elements .",
    "this is observed in natural phenomena ranging from complex chemical reactions , where biomolecules react with each other only when they have reached appropriate internal configurations @xcite , to social systems , where the appearance of organizational structures requires compatibility between the individual changing states of the involved agents @xcite . focusing on this motivation , in this paper we study a model of coupled motile elements where interactions depend on the internal state of each element .",
    "individual internal variables change with time according to a prescribed autonomous evolution law , so that interactions are also time - dependent , and result to be alternatively attractive or repulsive .",
    "this intricate interaction pattern induces several complex regimes of collective evolution , including dynamical clustering .",
    "clustering in systems of interacting moving particles with internal dynamics has been demonstrated when the internal states of different elements are mutually coupled and their individual evolution is chaotic @xcite . in such case , the synchronization of internal variables results into spatial organization , through the effect of those variables on the degrees of freedom associated with motion . here , we show that similar forms of collective behaviour are already possible with simple , autonomous oscillatory dynamics for the internal variables .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the model and present numerical results for the case of two - dimensional motion in a bounded domain .",
    "the occurrence of different dynamical regimes is controlled by the range of interactions and by the dispersion in the time scales associated with the internal dynamics . in section [ sect2 ] ,",
    "the limit of large interaction ranges is analyzed . in this limit",
    ", the system reduces to an ensemble of identical phase oscillators with internal states . as the dispersion in the time scales of internal variables is varied",
    ", it exhibits an order - disorder transition between a configuration where the phase and the internal variable are highly correlated and a uncorrelated state .",
    "this critical transition , which we are able to describe analytically , is mediated by a regime of dynamical clustering .",
    "both the transition and the clustering regime are characterized by means of suitably defined order parameters . in the final section",
    ", we discuss our results with emphasis in the features that might be also observed in other systems of similar kinds .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 motile elements at positions @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the elements interact through pair forces @xmath3 depending on their relative positions .",
    "moreover , the interaction of each pair is modulated by a function @xmath4 of the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which characterize the internal state of the respective elements .",
    "this modulation aims at describing the effects of the internal states on the spatial dynamics .",
    "the motion of the elements is assumed to be overdamped , so that the equation of motion for element @xmath7 is @xmath8    from the viewpoint of the numerical resolution of eqs .",
    "( [ eqmot1 ] ) , a convenient choice for the interactions a truncated elastic force , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the elastic constant and @xmath11 is the interaction range .",
    "as for the internal state described by the variable @xmath5 , we assume that each element behaves as an autonomous oscillator with constant frequency @xmath12 , much like a `` biological clock . ''",
    "biological periodic phenomena at several levels , from intracellular chemical reactions to complex long - period rhythms , are in fact well described by such elementary cyclic processes @xcite .",
    "the internal variable represents thus a phase , and evolves in time as @xmath13 to take into account inhomogeneity in the ensemble , the frequencies @xmath12 are drawn from a given distribution @xmath14 . here , we take the gaussian @xmath15.\\ ] ] the autonomous dynamics of the internal phases @xmath5 represents cyclic processes which , in our model , are not influenced by external factors but affect the interaction between elements .",

    "( [ eqmot1 ] ) is chosen as @xmath16,\\ ] ] with @xmath17 . with this choice",
    ", the interaction between elements @xmath7 and @xmath18 changes its sign periodically , in a time scale of order @xmath19 .",
    "thus , it is alternatively attractive or repulsive , respectively favoring or inhibiting the aggregation of elements . at the level of the whole ensemble ,",
    "this variations give rise to a complex time - dependent interaction pattern which , as shown below , induces a variety of dynamical regimes , including dynamical clustering .",
    "note that , according to eq .",
    "( [ vv ] ) , interactions between pairs of elements do not depend separately on the individual frequencies , but on the frequency differences @xmath20 .",
    "thus , in eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) , we can fix @xmath21 .    as a final ingredient of the model , it is necessary to consider that the ensemble is confined within a bounded spatial domain .",
    "in fact , when mutually attracting elements have aggregated into clusters , we expect that the remnant repulsion between elements in different neighbor clusters drives them away from each other . in the long run",
    ", this effect would lead to the total dispersion of the ensemble .",
    "therefore , we assume that the system evolves into a closed domain with reflecting boundaries .",
    "we have extensively studied the above model , by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eqmot1 ] ) numerically for a two - dimensional system , where an ensemble of @xmath22 elements is confined within a circle of radius @xmath23 .",
    "simultaneous rescaling of frequencies and time makes it possible to fix the elastic constant to @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , we choose @xmath23 as the unit of distance . in this way , the only relevant parameters in the model are the interaction range @xmath11 and the frequency dispersion @xmath25 .    truncation errors in the numerical resolution of the equations of motion ( [ eqmot1 ] ) may cause that , under the effect of attractive interactions , two elements collapse to numerically indistinguishable positions .",
    "this is expected to happen , in particular , when the evolution of internal phases is slow ( small @xmath25 ) so that attractive interactions can act during sufficiently long times . under such conditions , in view of eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) , the mutual interaction of the collapsed elements will vanish , and the forces applied on each of them by any other element will be identical .",
    "consequently , the collapsed elements will remain `` stuck together '' for the remaining of the evolution . to avoid this numerical artifact",
    ", we introduce in eqs .",
    "( [ eqmot1 ] ) a small additive - noise term which prevents the spatial collapse of elements and , otherwise , does not affect the dynamics .",
    "figure [ figr2 ] shows four successive snapshots of the ensemble , in a single realization with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we find that many elements are entrained in several compact clusters , while others are distributed in space along curved lines , forming `` strings . ''",
    "these `` strings '' result from the instabilization of clusters , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figr2]a and b. generally , the distribution of internal phases @xmath5 of the elements belonging a given cluster spans a total angle less than @xmath28 , but this total angle is often larger than @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that , inside a cluster , the difference of internal phases between a pair of elements can be larger than @xmath30 , and their interaction can thus be repulsive .",
    "however , the two elements can be part of the same cluster due to the presence of other elements with intermediate internal phases .",
    "these elements mediate the interaction between the otherwise repulsive pairs , in such a way that the effective force is attractive towards the cluster .",
    "once a cluster is formed , and after a certain transient has elapsed , the total angle spanned by the distribution of internal phases @xmath5 grows with time , due to the individual evolution of each phase , eq .  ( [ eqtet ] ) .",
    "this growth takes place within time scales of order @xmath31 . under some simplifying assumptions",
    ", it can be shown that a cluster becomes unstable when the total angle spanned by the internal phases reaches @xmath28 .",
    "suppose that , at a given moment , the internal phases of the @xmath32 elements belonging to a cluster are uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath33 .",
    "suppose also that all the elements are at the same point in space , except for a test element at a small distance @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) from the cluster . if @xmath32 is sufficiently large , taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ eqmot1 ] ) to ( [ vv ] ) , the equation of motion of the test element can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the internal phase of the test element .",

    "( [ test ] ) is negative for all @xmath38 if @xmath39 . under these conditions ,",
    "the force on the test element is attractive .",
    "as @xmath40 reaches @xmath28 , however , the factor of @xmath34 becomes positive at @xmath41 and @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that , as soon as @xmath42 , the elements with extreme internal phases , @xmath43 or @xmath44 , will be repelled from the cluster . due to their mutual repulsion",
    ", elements with internal phases close to @xmath45 and @xmath46 will move away from the cluster in opposite directions . moreover , as the distribution of phases in the remaining of the cluster keeps broadening and new elements reach the stability limits , they will be attracted by those elements with similar phases which have just left the cluster , and therefore move in their direction .",
    "this mechanism gives rise to the `` strings '' of elements when a cluster becomes unstable and disintegrates .",
    "the dynamics of clustering is effectively illustrated by the distribution of distances between elements @xcite . calculating the @xmath47 euclidean pair distances @xmath48 for all @xmath7 and @xmath49",
    ", we construct a histogram where the height of the column with base @xmath50 is proportional to the number of pair distances within that interval .",
    "compact clusters cause the appearance of sharp peaks in the histogram , at @xmath51 and other distances , while non - clustered elements give rise to a smooth background .",
    "figure [ figcl ] shows , as a density plot , the evolution of a @xmath52-column histogram of pair distances @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) for the same numerical realization as in fig .",
    "[ figr2 ] , between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "as expected , the region @xmath57 is strongly depleted ( except for the peak at @xmath51 ) , because pairs of elements at such distances either become entrained into clusters or are mutually repelling . for @xmath58 ,",
    "dark horizontal lines reveal localized compact clusters . as time elapses",
    ", these clusters can become less well - defined , and they are seen to move , disperse , coalesce , or split to form smaller groups .",
    "this complex dynamics , driven by the autonomous evolution of the internal phases , calls for a statistical description in terms of a characterization of the partition of the ensemble into clusters . with this aim ,",
    "we introduce two order parameters @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is the time - averaged fraction of pair distances smaller than a certain small threshold @xmath60 .",

    "the second parameter , @xmath67 , is given by the time - averaged fraction of elements which have at least another element as a distance smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "it can be calculated as @xmath68 associating the threshold @xmath60 with the ( maximal ) size of a cluster , both parameters are statistical measures of the degree of clustering in the ensemble .",
    "their values are close to zero if most elements are not entrained , and reach unity if all elements belong to clusters .",
    "they are , however , independent quantities . for a fixed value of @xmath67 , which measures the total population inside clusters ,",
    "@xmath59 is small if the number of clusters is large , and _",
    "vice versa_. in other words , @xmath59 characterizes the average number of elements per cluster .",
    "an approximate evaluation of the number of clusters @xmath69 is obtained by assuming that all clusters have the same population , as @xmath70 @xcite .    to characterize clustering in our system ,",
    "we have numerically calculated the order parameters @xmath59 and @xmath67 as functions of the frequency dispersion @xmath25 and the interaction range @xmath11 in a system of @xmath22 elements , taking @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ figr4 ] shows @xmath59 and @xmath67 versus @xmath25 for @xmath26 . for this intermediate value of the interaction range ,",
    "the two order parameters display a moderate decrease as the frequency dispersion grows .",
    "as frequency differences become larger , the typical length of the time intervals during which the interaction of a given pair of elements is attractive shortens .",
    "consequently , shorter times are available for the aggregation of elements into clusters and , thus , the average degree of clustering diminishes .",
    "the approximate number of clusters , calculated as @xmath70 , is practically constant , @xmath72 , in the considered interval of variation for @xmath25 .",
    "the same behaviour is found for smaller values of the interaction range . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath11 ,",
    "the dependence with the frequency dispersion becomes less trivial .",
    "we analyze this specific situation in the next section .",
    "the dependence of the clustering order parameters @xmath59 and @xmath67 on the interaction range @xmath11 for fixed @xmath25 is more interesting , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figr3 ] for @xmath27 .",

    "the approximate number of clusters , @xmath70 , grows steadily from @xmath75 for @xmath76 and attains a sharp maximum , @xmath77 , at @xmath78 . for larger interaction ranges",
    ", it soon reaches an almost constant value , @xmath72 .    in order to explain the non - monotonic dependence of the clustering order parameters with the interaction range , it is useful to inspect the instantaneous spatial distribution of the ensemble for different values of @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ figr1 ] ) . for sufficiently small @xmath11 ,",
    "there is little chance that two elements are simultaneously found within the interaction range . in our two - dimensional system , the average distance @xmath79 between elements can be evaluated as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the area of the domain accessible to the ensemble . taking @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we find @xmath84 .",
    "figures [ figr1]a and b show that for @xmath85 only a few elements form clusters , whereas for @xmath86 most of the ensemble is clustered in many groups . for such values of the interaction range , consequently , the clustering order parameters increase with @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ figr3 ] ) .",
    "as the interaction range grows , the collective organization of elements in larger spatial structures becomes possible .",
    "in particular , the `` strings '' associated with unstable clusters , discussed above , entrain now a substantial part of the ensemble ( fig .  [ figr1]c ) . the contribution of these structures to the clustering order parameters",
    "is expected to be considerably weaker than that of compact clusters , which explains the decline of @xmath59 and @xmath67 for @xmath87 . for even larger",
    "interaction ranges the dynamics is dominated by the remnant repulsive interaction between compact clusters .",
    "when @xmath11 is sufficiently large , all the elements are found most of the time at the boundary of the spatial domain ( fig .  [",
    "figr1]d ) .",
    "note that elements are still organized in space according to their internal state : generally , neighbouring elements have similar internal phases .",
    "this form of organization in the limit of large interaction ranges is treated in detail in the next section .",
    "the change in the collective spatial distribution as the interaction range grows is also apparent in the distribution of pair distances @xmath88 .",
    "figure [ figr1a ] shows @xmath52-column normalized histograms of pair distances for the snapshots shown in fig .  [ figr1 ] . when the degree of clustering is small ( fig .",
    "[ figr1a]a ) the distribution of pair distances is rather smooth , and no significant contributions are present at @xmath89 . as the interaction range grows and clustering becomes more important , the distribution spreads and develops sharp spikes .",
    "note , in particular , the high peak at @xmath51 ( fig .  [ figr1a]b and c ) . for even larger @xmath11 the degree of clustering recedes ,",
    "the peak at @xmath51 becomes smaller , and other spikes are replaced by broader structures ( fig .",
    "[ figr1a]d ) .",
    "the highest peak , centered at @xmath90 , is a direct byproduct of the concentration of elements in the boundary of the spatial domain .",
    "the fact that , in the limit of large interaction range , the ensemble is mainly concentrated in the boundary of the accessible domain suggest a reduced representation of the problem , where the position of each element is given by a linear coordinate along the boundary . in the case of the circular domain",
    "considered above , such approximation yields a set of dynamical equations which are formally equivalent to the model equations of coupled phase oscillators . as shown in the next section , this reduced representation admits to be studied analytically to a considerable extent .",
    "when the range of interactions is larger than the linear size of the system , all the elements are subject to the action of the whole ensemble at all times . as discussed in the preceding section , the regime of large @xmath11 is characterized by the repelling interaction of clusters , which drives the elements to the boundaries of the accessible spatial domain . for the case of the circular domain",
    "considered above , the position of an element at the boundary can be characterized by the angle @xmath91 defined by the element and an arbitrarily chosen origin , with vertex at the center of the circle . assuming that the elements do not abandon the boundary at any time",

    "therefore , @xmath98    the equation of motion for @xmath91 becomes @xmath99 remarkably , this equation is formally equivalent to the model equation for an ensemble of phase oscillators with identical natural frequencies @xmath100 , where the state of each oscillator is characterized by its phase @xmath91 .",

    "( [ eqtet ] ) and ( [ vv ] ) , various forms of collective evolution including dynamical clustering emerge .",

    "if , sufficiently close to the point where this equation holds , @xmath152 varies linearly with the control parameter @xmath25 , the order parameter will behave as @xmath153 , changes if the maximum of @xmath14 at @xmath147 is not quadratic .    using the complex vector @xmath154 defined in eq .",
    "( [ bfm ] ) , the equation of motion ( [ eqmot2 ] ) for the phase of an individual oscillator can be recast as @xmath155 the form of this equation emphasizes the mean - field nature of the interactions , as @xmath156 depends only on the individual variables @xmath91 and @xmath5 and on the averages involved in the definition of @xmath154 . since for asymptotically large ensembles , @xmath113 ,",
    "@xmath157 is zero for @xmath144 , both @xmath158 and @xmath159 must also vanish beyond the transition .",
    "this implies that in the thermodynamical limit and for @xmath144 , @xmath160 and the dynamics is thus frozen . for finite systems ,",
    "@xmath158 and @xmath159 are of order @xmath161 .",
    "the evolution of individual phases can therefore be thought as driven by random forces of that order . below the transition , evolution becomes progressively slower as @xmath25 approaches the critical point .",
    "as pointed out above , the dynamical regimes of small and large frequency dispersion are separated by a region , around @xmath162 , where clustering is found ( fig .",
    "[ figo1]b ) . to disclose the properties of this intermediate regime ,",
    "we have numerically studied the evolution of the distribution of phases @xmath91 .",
    "recording the evolution of each phase , we construct a histogram where the height of the column with base @xmath163 is proportional to the number of oscillators whose phases lie within that interval .",
    "figure [ figo3 ] shows a density plot of such histogram as a function of time , for @xmath164 .",
    "we note that a fraction of the ensemble is entrained into four clusters .",
    "a close inspection of these clusters shows that they are formed by the oscillators of subensemble ii ( see sect .",
    "[ sect32 ] ) with internal frequencies just above their lowest value , @xmath165 .",
    "though the clusters are not sharply localized , it is still possible to define their phase by averaging @xmath91 over the oscillators belonging to each cluster .",
    "two of these clusters , whose phases differ by @xmath28 , move at a well defined velocity in one direction . the other two , whose phases also differ by @xmath28 , move in the opposite direction and with the same speed .",
    "the two pairs of clusters are formed by oscillators whose internal frequencies have opposite signs .",
    "figure [ clus0]a illustrates the situation . due to their contrary motion , the two pairs of clusters cross each other recurrently .",
    "when these crossings happen , their populations are temporarily superimposed in phase .",
    "consequently , two big clusters with opposite phases are recurrently built up ( figs .",
    "[ figo3 ] and [ clus0]b ) .",
    "figure [ figo1]b shows a @xmath166-oscillator ensemble at one of such events .",
    "the recursive formation of the two anti - phase big clusters can be quantitatively characterized by an order parameter .",
    "the modulus of the complex quantity @xmath167 is approximately equal to one if the whole ensemble splits into two anti - phase well - localized clusters of similar sizes , while for incoherent or higher - order clustered states we have @xmath168 .",
    "figure [ clus00]a shows the evolution of @xmath169 in the clustering regime , displaying its irregular oscillations between small and large values . for the same realization ,",
    "[ clus00]b shows the phase difference @xmath170 for two oscillators @xmath171 and @xmath172 in subensemble ii .",
    "large positive values of @xmath173 identify states where the two oscillators are part of the same cluster , while negative values correspond to the situation where they are in different clusters .",
    "the intermittent transitions of @xmath174 between positive and negative values demonstrate the dynamical nature of clustering , where clusters maintain their identity but elements can migrate between them .",
    "the average of @xmath169 over long times provides a suitable order parameter , @xmath175 , for the detection of clustered states .",
    "note that @xmath175 and @xmath120 are independent order parameters , as they measure fourier contributions of different order to the distribution of phases .",
    "figure [ clusb ] shows numerical results for @xmath175 as a function of the frequency dispersion . as @xmath25 approaches the critical value @xmath142 from below , @xmath175 grows and exhibits a peak just at the left of the critical point .",
    "the profile of this peak becomes better defined as the ensemble size @xmath0 grows .",
    "the order parameter grows from zero at @xmath176 and reaches the maximum value @xmath177 for @xmath178 . beyond the transition ,",
    "@xmath175 drops abruptly .",
    "results for the largest ensembles suggest that , in the thermodynamical limit , it vanishes for @xmath144 .",
    "the suppression of clustering beyond the transition is a consequence of the fact that , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect32 ] , the evolution of asymptotically large ensembles becomes frozen .",
    "as @xmath25 approaches the critical point and the order parameter @xmath120 tends to vanish , the typical evolution time scales which , according to eq .",
    "( [ mupm ] ) , are of order @xmath179 are increasingly large .",
    "thus , the formation of clusters is progressively retarded and , finally , it is suppressed .",
    "the appearance of the four clusters in the transition regime can be qualitatively understood taking into account that , for an oscillator with internal frequency @xmath12 , the most persistent interactions affecting its dynamics are due to oscillators with similar frequencies , @xmath180 . in such case , in fact , the interaction weight @xmath181 remains almost constant over very long time scales , of order @xmath182 .",
    "fixing the attention on a group of oscillators with similar frequencies , we realize that their interactions are weighted by almost time - independent factors which , however , can take a different value for each oscillator pair .",
    "we can have both positive and negative interaction weights .",
    "now , it is known that an ensemble of coupled oscillators with disordered interactions forms , if the level of frustration is moderate , two anti - phase localized clusters @xcite . in our system , triggering the formation of these two clusters requires moreover that the phases @xmath91 are not pinned to the internal variables @xmath5 , and that a sufficiently large population with similar frequencies actually exist .",
    "these two conditions are met by the oscillators of subensemble ii with frequencies close to the limit @xmath183 , where the density is larger .",
    "we expect that two clusters form in the region of positive frequencies , and other two clusters appear for @xmath184 .",
    "the symmetry of this configuration insures that the two pairs of clusters will move in opposite direction and with the same speed .",
    "as far as @xmath25 remains below the transition point , increasing the frequency dispersion contributes in two cooperating ways to the growth of the population of these clusters : larger values of @xmath25 imply more oscillators with higher internal frequencies and , at the same time , a larger fraction in subensemble ii , as @xmath120 decreases .",
    "we have studied , both numerically and analytically , the dynamical regimes of an ensemble of coupled motile elements whose interactions are determined by the evolution of their internal states . the interaction of each pair of elements is alternatively attractive or repulsive , changing its sign within time scales associated with the relative variation of the respective internal variables . though",
    "in our study we have considered specific forms both for the spatial dependence of the interactions and for their modulation by the internal state , our main results are expected to hold for a broad class of similar models .",
    "the following summary is focused on such generic conclusions .",
    "transitions between different dynamical regimes are controlled by two parameters : the range of interactions and the typical evolution time of the internal variables .",
    "the latter determines , in turn , the time scales within which interactions change their sign .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both positive and negative pair interactions induces the formation of localized clusters of mutually attracting elements .",
    "the remnant repulsion drives clusters away from each other , a tendency to expansion that must be counteracted by suitable boundary conditions . due to the change of the sign of interactions , clustering is dynamical , as elements intermittently aggregate , disperse , and migrate between clusters .",
    "the actual development of localized clusters , however , requires that the interaction range is neither too small nor too large .",
    "clusters are practically not formed if that range is smaller than the average distance between elements , while for large interaction ranges other kinds of spatial organization , such as `` strings '' of elements and condensation in the boundaries , become more frequent .    when the range of interactions is large as compared with the spatial size of the system , interactions act in conditions similar to those of global coupling @xcite , though different interaction weights are still possible between different element pairs . in such conditions , the spatial distribution of the ensemble becomes less relevant to the collective dynamics , because interactions are now independent of the relative position of elements .",
    "yet , their individual positions are still determined by their interactions , which are now mainly driven by the internal variables . when the evolution of the internal variables is sufficiently slow",
    ", the spatial distribution can follow it almost adiabatically , and the relative position of the elements adjusts to their instantaneous internal state . as a result , a state of high correlation between spatial and internal variables develops . due to the autonomous internal evolution of each element , this ordered state is dynamical , and the spatial distribution keeps varying with time . on the other hand ,",
    "if the internal variables change too fast , the spatial coordinates fail to follow their evolution , and correlation between them breaks down .",
    "if the internal evolution is sufficiently fast and the time average of pair interactions is zero , the spatial distribution of the ensemble becomes frozen . in our specific model ,",
    "the transition between the ordered and the disordered state has the properties of a critical phenomenon . in the disordered state , evolution is frozen in the limit of an infinitely large ensemble .",
    "the transition is mediated by a regime of dynamical clustering , induced by the persistent interaction between elements whose internal variables change within similar time scales , and whose positions and internal states are not strongly correlated .",
    "the dynamics of internal states is expected to be an essential ingredient in the description of systems whose collective evolution resembles the complex collective dynamics of biological and social populations @xcite .",
    "spontaneous development of coherent behaviour may be enhanced if individual internal variables are allowed to interact with each other .",
    "in fact , the organization of the ensemble at the level of the individual internal states , due to their mutual interaction , would imply coherence also at the level of other variables , such as the spatial position .",
    "these processes are expected to be relevant to the modeling of social - like mechanisms , of the type of imitation , social influence , and formation of coalitions and hierarchical structures .",
    "the investigation of their role in the emergence of order has already been initiated in the literature @xcite , also in connection with evolutionary adaptive phenomena @xcite ."
