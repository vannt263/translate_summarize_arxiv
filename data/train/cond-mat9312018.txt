    "there has been some interest in the theory of zero temperature quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems for a few years now  @xcite , particularly in the context of metal - insulator transitions  @xcite",
    ". however , the recent proliferation of experimental systems in which such transitions may be observed has lead to a surge in theoretical work .",
    "transitions of interest include the superconductor - insulator transition in thin films  @xcite , the transition between the plateaus in the quantum hall effect  @xcite , and a variety of magnetic order - disorder transitions in the cuprate compounds  @xcite , metal - semiconductor composites  @xcite , and heavy - fermion  @xcite systems .",
    "in this paper we will examine some special properties , in the vicinity of second - order quantum transitions , associated with `` conserved charges '' , _",
    "i.e. _ observables which commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "related issues have been discussed recently by other investigators  @xcite , with their focus being on the @xmath3 properties of the currents associated with conserved charge .",
    "we will study here the unusual and remarkable properties of fluctuations of conserved charges themselves in the finite - temperature _ quantum - critical _",
    "@xcite region near the quantum phase transition .",
    "the quantum - critical region was introduced by chakravarty _ et .",
    "@xcite in the context of the two - dimensional quantum sigma model .",
    "an analogous region can in fact be defined in the vicinity of _ any _ second - order quantum phase transition , as the region where @xmath4 is significantly larger than any energy scale which measures deviations of the coupling constants from their zero temperature critical values .",
    "note that , somewhat counter - intuitively , the quantum - critical region occurs at high temperatures ; of course , the temperature can not be so large that it becomes of the order of some high - energy cutoff in the system . at short distance / time",
    "scales the system displays the scale - invariant properties of some zero temperature critical point ; at larger scales , the critical fluctuations are quenched by thermal effects in a universal manner described in ref .",
    "@xcite . because @xmath4 is large",
    ", the thermal quenching occurs _ before _",
    "the deviations of the couplings from their ground - state critical values have had a chance to take effect .",
    "thus , in the quantum - critical region , the dominant behavior of the system is described at _ all _ scales by the zero temperature critical point and its universal response to a finite temperature .",
    "further , the only effect of a finite temperature is to impose a finite length @xmath5 along the imaginary time direction on the quantum field - theory of the zero - temperature critical - point ; the temperature response of the critical point can thus be described by the principles of finite - size scaling  @xcite .",
    "this paper will examine the non - linear , finite temperature response of a system in the quantum - critical region to an external field which couples to a conserved charge .",
    "our motivation to examine this issue comes primarily from quantum spin systems  @xcite and heavy - fermion alloys  @xcite , although we will attempt to phrase our discussion as generally as possible .",
    "after some general discussion on conserved charges and their scaling properties in sections  [ general ] and  [ scaling ] , we will present illustrative calculations on a number of model systems ( section  [ model ] ) .    strictly speaking",
    ", the considerations of this paper will use only some modest assumptions about the zero temperature critical point .",
    "in particular we will only require that it be gapless with a power - law singularity in the density of low - energy energy excitations .",
    "one can imagine , particularly in random quantum systems , that this condition may be satisfied even by systems which are strictly not at a scale - invariant critical point .",
    "we expect that our results will apply to such systems too",
    ". however , for definiteness , we will continue to phrase our discussion in the language of second - order quantum phase transitions .    in section  [ ferromagnet ]",
    ", we will consider a special application of our results to the case where the conserved charge is itself the order parameter of the transition : the most familiar example of this is the ferromagnet - paramagnet transition in a fermi liquid .",
    "we will show that the existing treatment of this transition  @xcite is fundamentally incomplete , and will indicate the restrictions any correct theory must satisfy ; we will , however , not provide such a theory here .",
    "this section will discuss the general constraints that are imposed on correlators of conserved charges and currents .",
    "these constraints are perhaps most familiar in the particle physics context of ` current algebra '  @xcite .",
    "we will review these ideas here in a formulation designed to address quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems .",
    "moreover , in the latter context , our point of view is different from previous ones  @xcite , and it therefore appears worthwhile to present the complete argument in its full generality .",
    "consider , then , the partition function , @xmath6 , of the system of interest in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition : @xmath7 \\right).\\ ] ] the lagrangian @xmath8 is a functional of a set of fields @xmath9 which are assumed to be bosonic for simplicity - the extension to fermionic fields is straightforward .",
    "the fields depend implicitly on the @xmath10 spatial co - ordinates @xmath11 and the imaginary time co - ordinate @xmath12 .",
    "all allowed configurations are periodic in @xmath12 , with period @xmath13 where @xmath0 is the absolute temperature",
    ". we will find it more convenient to think of @xmath12 running from @xmath14 to @xmath15 with the constraint on the periodicity of the fields , rather than , as is conventionally done , restricting attention to the fundamental domain @xmath16 .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath8 is invariant ( upto a total time derivative ) , under some spacetime-_independent _ symmetry transformation of the fields @xmath17 . in its infinitesimal form , this transformation can be written as @xmath18 where the @xmath19 are the infinitesimal , dimensionless , parameters specifying the transformation and the @xmath20 are the generators of the lie algebra associated with the symmetry .",
    "these generators will satisfy a commutation relation of the form @xmath21 = i f_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } f^{\\gamma}\\ ] ] where the @xmath22 are the structure constants of the lie algebra .",

    "the following approach is found to be the most direct : generalize the lagrangian @xmath33 $ ] to the field - dependent @xmath34 $ ] and evaluate @xmath35   \\right ) .",

    "let us now examine a few simple examples of the above construction .",
    "non - relativistic spin-1/2 electrons , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , in an external magnetic field @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are described by the following lagrangian @xmath41\\ ] ] where the ellipses indicate terms without any derivatives , the @xmath42 are pauli matrices , and @xmath43 is the gyromagnetic coupling .",
    "the paramagnetic and diamagnetic couplings of the field to the electrons play totally distinct roles in the present symmetry analysis .",
    "there are two distinct conserved charges - the total number and total spin of the electrons .",
    "the first is associated with the @xmath44 symmetry @xmath45 upon gauging this symmetry we see that the @xmath46 are the spatial components of the @xmath47 fields introduced above @xmath48 the second is the spin - rotation symmetry @xmath49 which when gauged leads to the transformation @xmath50 on the magnetic field ( @xmath51 is the totally antisymmetric tensor ) .",
    "thus @xmath52 is the @xmath12-component of the non - abelian @xmath53 gauge field , @xmath31 , associated with the @xmath53 spin - rotation invariance .",
    "note that @xmath54 is purely imaginary .",
    "we shall mainly focus on the consequences of this second symmetry in this paper .",
    "this model is a popular long - wavelength description of low - lying spin excitations in an insulating antiferromagnet . in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath56 ,",
    "the lagrangian takes the form  @xcite @xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a 3-component , real , unit - vector representing the local orientation of the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "@xmath8 is invariant under an @xmath55 symmetry under which @xmath59 while @xmath56 continues to transform as in ( [ hsu2 ] ) and thus @xmath52 is the @xmath12-component of a @xmath55 non - abelian gauge field .",
    "the symmetry analysis of the path - integral of quantum spin systems is somewhat more subtle , but our general discussion has been phrased carefully to include this case . as was first shown by haldane",
    "@xcite , the path integral of any quantum spin hamiltonian involves the lagrangian @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the half - integral / integral magnitude of the spin , the @xmath62 are unit 3-vectors on sites @xmath63 representing the instantaneous orientation of the spin , and @xmath64 is any function satisfying @xmath65 ( we have momentarily dropped the site index @xmath63 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath66 does not involve any time derivatives , and is spin - rotation invariant .",
    "let us now make a space - independent , but time - dependent rotation of all the spins @xmath67 inserting this into @xmath8 , using ( [ dirac ] ) and the unit - length constraint on @xmath68 , simple manipulations show that , upto a total time derivative , @xmath69 by our prescription ( [ defq ] ) this identifies @xmath70 as the conserved total spin . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "the action is clearly @xmath71 this is now invariant under time - dependent gauge transformations with @xmath72 transforming as in ( [ hsu2 ] ) .",
    "note that the ` rule ' of replacing derivatives with covariant derivatives does not hold in this case - our formulation is however still valid .",

    "we will consider first the ward identities satisfied by correlators of the conserved charges and currents .",
    "this will be followed by a discussion of properties properties of the system in a time - independent external field .",
    "an important property of the functional @xmath73 in ( [ zamu ] ) is that @xmath74 for any spacetime dependent gauge transformation @xmath19 such that ( [ trans ] ) is consistent with the boundary conditions @xmath75 .",

    "the right - hand side is the analog of the ` streaming ' or ` poisson - bracket ' terms  @xcite in the theory of the dynamics of classical phase transitions ; this term dictates that the conserved charge undergoes a uniform precession under the presence of the external field .    in the following",
    "we will mostly be interested in constraints on correlators of the conserved charges @xmath26 under conditions in which only the @xmath12 component of the @xmath31 is non - zero . by integrating ( [ ward1 ] ) over all space we can obtain a constraint on these correlators @xmath78 a particularly useful consequence of ( [ ward2 ] ) is the constraints it places on two and three - point functions of the conserved charges . if we make the expansion ( restricting , for simplicity , to a translationally invariant system ) @xmath79 where the @xmath80 and @xmath81 are momenta and frequencies and @xmath82 is the free energy density , we see from ( [ ward2 ] ) that @xmath83 this identity will be useful to us later in our study of ferromagnets",
    ".      we will consider explicitly only the case of a time - independent , uniform , @xmath54 field ; the spatial components @xmath84 will be taken to be zero . as was clear from the examples considered above , the @xmath54 corresponds to an _ imaginary _ external magnetic field in spin systems .",
    "to emphasize this we will use the notation @xmath85 as in section  [ teqz ] we attempt to ` gauge away ' the field dependence of @xmath86 for the case of a time - independent @xmath56 . from ( [ connection ] )",
    "it appears that we should choose @xmath87 ( a generalized josephson equation ) .",

    "we have therefore @xmath88    \\right ) .",
    "\\label{twist}\\ ] ] thus the _ sole _ effect of the field @xmath56 is to put a twist in the periodic boundary conditions on @xmath89 by an _ imaginary _",
    "angle @xmath90 .",
    "we will focus almost all our subsequent attention in the ` quantum - critical region '  @xcite where @xmath4 is much greater than any intrinsic low - energy scale associated with the deviation of the ground state from criticality ( we must of course not make @xmath4 so large that it becomes comparable to ultraviolet cutoff s in the system ) . in this region , the leading @xmath0 dependence of all observables is specified by properties of the @xmath3 critical point . in the following",
    ", we will therefore neglect the deviation of the ground state from criticality , although the extension to including its consequences are quite straightforward .",
    "also , we will mostly consider the case of a uniform , time - independent field @xmath91 , and refer to the external field using ( [ ath ] ) .",
    "we consider the properties of the the free - energy density @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the spatial volume of the system which is assumed to be infinite ) as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . consider first the case @xmath94 , and @xmath0 close to 0 .",
    "the only effect of a finite @xmath0 is in the imposition of a periodicity in @xmath89 with period @xmath95 on the critical , scale - invariant theory at @xmath3 , @xmath94 .",
    "the hypothesis of finite - size scaling  @xcite predicts the following temperature dependence in @xmath96 @xmath97 there is no general expression for the exponent @xmath98 , or the constant @xmath99 .",
    "however , if the system is below its upper critical dimension , the hyperscaling hypothesis  @xcite states that the scaling dimension of @xmath96 is identical to its naive engineering dimension : this yields @xmath100 the @xmath101 contribution is due to the @xmath102 prefactor in the definition of @xmath96 , and the remaining @xmath103 contribution is from the @xmath104 .",
    "the dynamic - critical exponent @xmath105 expresses the anisotropic scaling between space and time directions .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath99 in ( [ fdg ] ) is in general non - universal .",
    "for the special case of a relativistic field theory we have @xmath106 and the @xmath107 becomes universally related to the velocity of the low - lying excitations ; in this case in @xmath108 the number @xmath99 is closely related to the central charge of the conformal field theory describing the critical point .",
    "now consider the effect of a time - independent external field @xmath1 . from ( [ twist ] )",
    "the _ only _ effect of @xmath1 is a twist in the @xmath12 boundary conditions on the system .",
    "the excitations responding to the change in the boundary conditions will be precisely the same low - energy modes which led to a size ( @xmath0 ) dependence of @xmath96 in ( [ fdg ] ) : the only effect of a finite @xmath1 should therefore be a modification of the term proportional to @xmath99 in ( [ fdg ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as the twist is a long - wavelength effect , the modification of @xmath99 should be ` universal ' ( _ i.e. _ independent of all microscopic details ) function of the ` angle ' of the twist @xmath90 .",
    "alternatively , this is simply the statement that all finite - size scaling corrections are universal functions of ` geometrical ' properties of the sample like aspect ratios , shape , nature of boundary conditions etc .",
    "the fact that the angle of the twist is imaginary should not be too disturbing - the process of analytic continuation commutes with all scaling arguments , and one can just lift the scaling forms from those of real twists .",
    "we have therefore @xmath109 where @xmath110 . the value of @xmath111 will be chosen at our convenience , but the function @xmath112 is otherwise universal ( we use @xmath113 below ) . note in particular that the argument of the scaling function is precisely @xmath114 and there are no arbitrary scale factors in the argument .",
    "there is no guarantee that the function @xmath115 is analytic for finite , positive values of @xmath116 . in particular",
    ", some systems may undergo a phase transition at a finite @xmath1 , which will then correspond to a ( universal ) singularity in @xmath117 ; we will see an example of this in the model calculations below .",
    "the form of ( [ scalef ] ) implies immediately that the scaling dimension of @xmath1 ( or equivalently @xmath54 is precisely the same as that of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , under a scaling transformation which rescales spatial lengths by a factor @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "exactly parallel arguments can be made for the spatial components of the @xmath31 by thinking about the properties of the system in a geometry which is finite in the spatial directions , but infinite along the time direction - this will yield the scaling dimension of @xmath84 : @xmath122 we emphasize that that none of the results ( [ scalef ] ) , ( [ scaleat ] ) or ( [ scaleax ] ) rely upon the validity of hyperscaling .    in the presence of hyperscaling",
    ", one can go further , and also deduce the scaling dimensions of the conserved charges and currents .",
    "the @xmath29 and the @xmath31 are conjugate variables and their product should therefore have the same scaling dimension as the free energy ( which is @xmath123 ) .",
    "we have therefore @xmath124 _ only if _ hyperscaling is valid .",
    "a number of strong experimental consequences now follow from ( [ scalef ] ) .",
    "we can immediately obtain scaling forms for the ` magnetization ' @xmath125 and the specific heat @xmath126 : @xmath127 where the universal functions @xmath128 are both simply related to linear combinations of @xmath68 and its derivatives .",
    "notice that it is the same non - universal number @xmath129 which appears in both @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and there are no other non - universal quantities ; the only choice that had to be made was in the value of @xmath132 .",
    "all dependence on this choice , and hence @xmath129 , can be eliminated by considering the dimensionless generalized wilson ratio , @xmath133 @xmath134 which is a fully universal function of @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that the universality of @xmath133 did not rely on hyperscaling .",
    "experimental measurements of this ratio can thus provide us with strong tests of various theoretical scenarios , and also determine if different experimental systems are in the same universality class .",
    "we note that the universality of the wilson ratio as @xmath135 has also been noted recently for the incremental thermodynamic response of impurities in fermi liquids  @xcite : these models map onto boundary critical phenomena , whereas we have been considering the bulk response of a macroscopic critical system .",
    "we will now illustrate the general principles described above by model calculations on a number of systems .",
    "we begin with the simplet realization in the theory of luttinger liquids ; in this case the function @xmath136 will turn out to be independent of @xmath116 .",
    "none of the remaining models will have this property .",
    "we follow this by a second simple system - a dilute fermi gas - which also satisfies the scaling ansatzes .",
    "we will then examine a simple phenomenological model of a very complicated system - the bhatt - lee  @xcite model of random quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "finally we will present a self - contained analysis of a truly interacting system : the @xmath137 sigma model , whose main applicability is to the low - energy properties of clean , quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "we begin by presenting the simplest illustration of our results in the luttinger liquid theory of the low temperature properties of a dense one - dimensional gas of spin-1/2 fermions . in this case",
    "we are considering a whole critical phase , rather than a critical point .",
    "the low energy action of the luttinger liquid can be expressed in terms of two dimensionless scalar fields , @xmath138 , @xmath139 @xmath140\\ ] ] where @xmath141 , @xmath142 are the charge and spin excitation velocities , and @xmath143 , @xmath144 are dimensionless couplings which determine the exponents of the luttinger liquid ; we have used here the notation of ref .",
    "spin rotation invariance requires @xmath145 .    in the presence of an external magnetic field couping via the zeeman term to the spin-1/2 fermions ,",
    "@xmath8 gets modified by the replacement @xmath146 .",

    "we get @xmath147 note that the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath96 is rather simple and has decoupled completely from its @xmath0 dependence : this is a special feature of the present model .",
    "the frequency summations and integrals can be performed exactly and yield a result consistent with ( [ scalef ] ) which is : @xmath148 the scaling properties of the magnetization and the specific heat now follow . in particular , we obtain for the generalized wilson ratio @xmath149 as stated above , @xmath150 is in fact independent of @xmath116 . this is a special feature of the luttinger / fermi liquid that does not generalize .",
    "the wilson ratio has most often been considered in the past in the context of luttinger / fermi liquids , and this is perhaps the reason why its universal , non - trivial , dependence on the ratio @xmath2 at generic quantum - critical points has not heretofore been pointed out .      consider a gas of fermions ( with spin @xmath63 ) in @xmath10 dimensions described by the following hamiltonian @xmath151 where @xmath152 annihilates fermions with momentum @xmath153 , and @xmath154 contains only repulsive interactions .",
    "this model has a @xmath3 quantum phase transition as a function of @xmath24 at @xmath155 .",
    "the density of fermions vanishes for @xmath156 , and increases as @xmath157 for @xmath158 .",
    "the scaling properties of this quantum transition are very similar to those of the corresponding transition for bosons which has been studied elsewhere  @xcite . from this analysis",
    "@xcite we may conclude that the exponent @xmath159 .",
    "also , it can be shown that the interactions in @xmath154 are irrelevant at this transition for @xmath160 ( they are infact also irrelevant below @xmath161 for spinless electrons ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath162 , we may compute the scaling properties of the free energy in the free fermion model .",
    "the conserved charge we focus on here is the density of the fermions .",
    "the field conjugate to this density is @xmath24 and therefore plays the role here of the ` magnetic ' field .",
    "thus consistent with ( [ scalef ] ) the free fermion free energy density obeys @xmath163 unlike section  [ luttinger ] , note that @xmath115 is quite a non - trivial function of @xmath116 , and leads to correspondingly non - trivial @xmath116-dependences in the scaling results for the density ( which plays the role of ` magnetization ' ) , specific heat , and wilson ratio .",

    "we now consider the application of the ideas of this paper to one of the very first models of quantum phase transitions that was considered by hertz  @xcite : the zero temperature transition from ferromagnet to a paramagnet in an itinerant fermi gas .",
    "the order parameter for this transition is clearly the local magnetization density , @xmath238 ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "this transition is special in that @xmath240 has a dual role - it is also the conserved charge density associated with global spin rotation invariance .",
