    "planets are formed in protoplanetary discs from interstellar dust .",
    "the electric charge state of the dust aggregates in the protoplanetary discs is one of the key parameters in understanding a number of aspects of protoplanetary discs and protoplanetary formation .",
    "planet formation begins with mutual sticking of@xmath6-sized dust , most probably leading to extremely low density , fluffy structure of the dust .",
    "the occurrence of fluffy dust is suggested by laboratory experiments , by theories , by n - body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by observations , including optical observations of dust in star forming region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations of dust linear polarization in comet comae .",
    "for a review of this field , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the inner structure of the dust aggregates , relative velocity , and electric charge are key parameters that determine the growth and migration of dust aggregates .",
    "dust relative velocity includes random motion caused by turbulence and brownian motion @xcite , and bulk motion caused by vertical sedimentation and radial migration @xcite .",
    "the collision velocity governs the growth rate @xcite , compactification @xcite , and disruption @xcite , of the dust .",
    "@xcite considered the charge state of the dust aggregates in protoplanetary discs .",
    "they assumed that the charge state is determined by absorption equilibrium of ions and free electrons .",
    "since electrons have much larger thermal velocity compared to positive ions , plasma absorption makes all dust to charge weakly negative .",
    "the repulsive coulomb force may suppress dust - dust collisional growth for all but the heaviest dust species who can overcome the coulomb barrier .",
    "it is also possible that the charge state of the dust is affected by dust - dust collision .",
    "the effect has been simply ignored in most research due to the fact that in protoplanetary discs , dust has low number density , and is surrounded by weakly ionised plasma .",
    "we give quantitative estimates of the effect of dust - dust collision as a function of dust size , fractal dimension , and number density , and show for the first time that the dust - dust collision is actually an important factor in high dust number density regions of protoplanetary discs .",
    "one of the possible dust - dust collisional charging mechanisms is known as the triboelectric process , where two bodies exchange electrons and sometimes molecular ions when they come into contact ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another mechanism is possible for materials with spontaneous surface charge , such as @xmath7 ice crystals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this mechanism",
    "the surface matter within typical depth @xmath8 @xcite is exchanged together with contained charge .",
    "surface space charge due to electron spill - out is widely known among metals and semiconductors @xcite , the charge separation being @xmath9 deep for metals and @xmath10 deep for semiconductors .",
    "@xmath7 is unique in that molecular ions @xmath11 and @xmath12 holds the charge , and that proton exchange between the molecules ( grotthus mechanism ; c.f .",
    "* ) allows charge diffusion much faster than molecular ion diffusion .",
    "thus surface charge separation develops as deep as @xmath13 @xcite . for example",
    ", ammonia lacks the mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is important that charge separation layer is deeper than exchange depth , because if the entire charge separation layer is exchanged , charge transport is neutral and collisional charging do not take place .    the dust - dust collisional charging due to the exchange of this spontaneous surface charge of ice crystals , is an established model in the context of meteorology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that explains lightning on earth .",
    "when two ice dust of different surface states collide , they exchange their surface charge , producing charged dust .",
    "when the charged particles within nonconducting gas are separated by some external force , electric field grows between them . at the point",
    "the electric field is larger than the dielectric field strength of the gas , rapid ionisation of the gas occurs , converting the electrostatic energy into kinetic energy of the electrons and ions .",
    "this is electric discharge .",
    "lightning in the earth s atmosphere is one of the most prominent , and well studied examples of electric discharge phenomena ; in thunderclouds , typically @xmath14 , or @xmath15 of electric charge is repeatedly separated and neutralized with typical length scales @xmath16 @xcite .    in protoplanetary discs ,",
    "lightning is one of the candidate mechanisms for chondrule heating , although compared to other models e.g. heating by shock wave ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some difficulties have been pointed out @xcite . for example , electric field can not grow large enough to cause electrostatic breakdown in standard discs @xcite .",
    "moreover , when@xmath17-sized silicate aggregates made of@xmath6-sized monomers are subject to electric discharge , they generally fragment without being thermally processed @xcite .",
    "lightning in protoplanetary discs is strongly related to turbulence . the relative random velocity between the charged dust species that sets the dust to collide , results from the turbulence .",
    "also the difference of the bulk velocities between the charged dust species that leads to macroscopic charge separation results from the turbulence .",
    "the turbulent state of the accretion discs is often expressed in terms of viscous @xmath18 parameter introduced by @xcite . since the specific angular momentum increases outward in keplerian discs ,",
    "they satisfy rayleigh s hydrodynamical stability criterion , and there are no clear mechanism for hydrodynamic turbulence in protoplanetary discs @xcite . on the other hand , the angular velocity decreases outward in keplerian discs , they satisfy criterion for magnetorotational instability ( mri ) .    therefore , if a protoplanetary disc is ionised enough to sustain magnetic field , mhd turbulence is excited and @xmath18 parameter can be as large as @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "if the ionisation is suppressed , on the other hand , @xmath20 . for a typical protoplanetary disc it is believed that so - called ` dead zones ' form between @xmath21 and @xmath22 where instabilities are damped and gas flow is almost laminar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but it is possible that mri is active in the whole disc , if sufficient ionisation degree is maintained , for example by turbulent mixing @xcite or by self - sustained ionisation @xcite .",
    "thus ionisation state of the protoplanetary discs is critical in determining @xmath18 and understanding the fate of planetesimals and protoplanetary discs .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : one is to solve the local charge exchange equilibrium of gas and dust numerically , for various dust parameters such as radii , fractal dimensions and dust number density , with dust - dust collisional charging taken into consideration ; given the results , the other goal is to determine the critical dust number density @xmath23 under which lightning to take place , as analytical functions of other dust parameters such as radii , fractal dimensions and disc environment parameters such as temperature and gas number density .",

    "in this section we describe our models . in [ two - component - model ]",
    "we model the disc and the dust at the unperturbed state , then introduce the models for dust number density . in [ section - circuit - model ] we model the charge density and charge separation processes .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned , we focus on a local , uniform box at certain orbital radius @xmath25 near the equatorial plane of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "we model the protoplanetary disc based on the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model @xcite .",

    "this leads to gas density distribution @xmath88 the dust - to - gas ratio in mmsn is approximately @xmath89 .",
    "we use the model by @xcite , and introduce two species of dust , the smaller dust and the larger dust ( see table [ table - terminology ] . ) we further assume that surface density of the larger dust is @xmath90 per cent of the total dust surface density . these two species are also either ` cationic ' and ` anionic . '",
    "the ` cationic ' species receives the positive electric charge through dust - dust collision",

    "( see  [ section - charge - separation ] for the details . )",
    "therefore , we expect that instead of considering four ( cationic smaller dust , cationic larger dust , anionic smaller dust , and anionic larger dust ) species of dust , we can correlate the two size species with the two charge tendency species , ( table [ table - terminology ] ) , although both correspondences ( smaller dust is cationic / larger dust is cationic ) are possible .    to summarise , we define the reference density of the smaller dust @xmath92 and the density of the larger dust @xmath93 as @xmath94    we further assume that within a local condensation region , density for each component of the disc are multiplied .",

    "the number density is density divided by dust mass : @xmath99 we estimate the mass as a function of the dust radius and the fractal dimension in  [ section - fluffy - dust - model ] .      , which has the unit @xmath100 , the amount of charge passed from one component to the other per unit disc volume per unit time .",

    "there are four species of charge carrier in our model  ions , electrons , cationic , and anionic dust ( table [ table - terminology ] ) .",
    "charge exchange processes between these species are ionisation , plasma absorption , and dust - dust collision .",

    "charge density of each vertex @xmath63 corresponds to an unknown quantities .",

    "charge neutrality gives us @xmath125 equation .",

    "if the smaller dust bump into the larger dust , i.e. if the line that passes the gravitational centre of the smaller dust and is parallel to the relative velocity vector do intersect with the larger dust , the smaller dust do not penetrate the larger dust but becomes a part of the larger dust .",
    "the cross section is of the order @xmath137 . in this case",
    "all the charges the smaller dust have are removed from the smaller dust charge density and added up to the larger dust charge density .",
    "this contributes to the dust - dust neutralization current , @xmath138 .      in this section",

    "the collisional cross sections for two electrically charged spherical particle is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140,@xmath141 is each particle s charge , @xmath142 is the temperature of their relative motion and @xmath143 is the geometric cross section ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath144 we can approximate the cross section as @xmath145 , which is bi - linear on @xmath140 and @xmath141 . on the other hand , cross section ( [ sigma_coulomb_focusing+ ] ) represents the effect of coulomb repulsion : for the collision between particles of the same charge only a portion of particles that belongs to the long tail of boltzmann s distribution for temperature @xmath142 can overcome the coulomb barrier and collide . on the limit @xmath146",
    "the cross section vanishes quickly , but never reaches @xmath147 .",
    "we use coulomb cross sections ( [ sigma_coulomb_focusing+ ] ) , ( [ sigma_coulomb_focusing- ] ) to estimate the event rate of gas - dust collision and dust - dust collision .",
    "the amount of charge exchanged in a collision , @xmath71 , is product of area of contact @xmath69 , upper limit of charge exchanged per unit surface area of contact @xmath148 , and the non - dimensional efficiency factor @xmath149 .",
    "we leave the detailed argument to determine @xmath150 to  [ section - charge - separation ] . here",
    "we assume that @xmath151 is known and describe how to estimate contact surface area @xmath69 . since it requires another detailed simulation to estimate @xmath69 qualitatively , we resort to an order - of - magnitude estimate for this part of the work .",
    "we illustrate the collision between a smaller dust and a larger dust in fig .",
    "[ figure - dust - collision ] .",
    "the smaller dust grazes the larger dust , pushes away the monomers that belong to the larger dust and creates a trench on the larger dust .",
    "the trench is a portion of the black cylinder in the figure .",
    "the radius and the length of the cylinder is @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively . therefore , the surface area of the trench @xmath154 is of order @xmath155 and the number of monomers @xmath156 required to fill the surface of the trench is @xmath157 their total surface area is also of the order of @xmath154 .",
    "however , @xmath158 overestimates the actual contact surface area if the large dust is so fluffy that there is not enough monomers in the trenched volume to fill the trench surface .    from the definition of the fractal dimension ( [ fractal - dimension - definition ] ) , the number density of monomers within the larger dust material is @xmath159 on the other hand the volume of the trench is @xmath160 therfore , the number of particle contained in the trench is @xmath161 and their total surface area is @xmath162    if @xmath163 , the surface of the trench is only partially covered by the monomers , and we estimate @xmath164 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath165 , @xmath166 monomers are crushed onto the trenched surface , and since they overlap , about @xmath156 monomers will take part in the charge exchange . in this case",
    "we estimate @xmath167 . to summarize , we assume that @xmath69 is the smaller of ( [ contact - surface - cut ] ) or ( [ contact - surface - fluffy ] ) : @xmath168      there are generally two classes of possible charge separation processes in protoplanetary discs .    one is surface charge exchange , where each dust has some kind of spontaneous charge separation @xcite , so at the initial condition each dust charge is zero as a whole ( globally neutral ) , but there are charge separation within the dust particles ( locally charged ) .",
    "for example , water ice crystals tend to gather negative charge at its surface and positive charge inside .",
    "when two dust aggregates with different charge collide and melt partially , they exchange molten material and the charge included in the molten material .",
    "as a result each dust gets globally charged .",
    "the other charge separation mechanism may be triboelectric processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , at the initial condition",
    "each dust is both globally and locally neutral .",
    "when two dust aggregates made of materials with different electron affinity collide , the surface electrons move from one material to the other .",
    "as a result each dust gets globally charged .",
    "the mechanism we consider the most plausible for the dust - dust collisional charge separation is surface charge exchange between ice dust . for the dust aggregate of ice mantled silicate , @xcite proposed a condensation scenario , that at the snow line ice larger dust drifting inward dissociate and many smaller dust form .",
    "there are established models on charge separation caused by ice - ice dust collision in the context of thundercloud meteorology ( for review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will carefully import them as a charge separation model in protoplanetary discs . the essential steps to cause lightning on earth are ( 1 )",
    "spontaneous charge separations on ice crystal surfaces , ( 2 ) existence of different dust species with different spontaneous charge separation per surface area , ( 3 ) collisions between the different dust that leads to global charging of each dust and ( 4 ) relative motion between the globally charged dust to create electrostatic field .    for ( 1 )",
    ", we argue that the charge separation per surface area is quantitatively the same as the values measured in laboratory experiments . for ( 2 ) , dominating dust species in charge separation process in protoplanetary discs is uncertain , and we discuss two possibilities ( c.f .  [ section - surface - charge - exchange - i ] ,  [ section - surface - charge - exchange - ii ] ) in this work . for ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we make simple estimations for the collision rate and relative velocity in protoplanetary discs .",
    "ice crystal surface is intrinsically charge - separated .",
    "ice is negatively charged near the surface , and the inside is positive .",
    "the typical charge surface density for stable ice surface is @xmath169 or @xmath170 and the typical skin depth of the charged layer is @xmath171 , though charge surface density for fast - growing ice surfaces are larger and shallower @xcite .",
    "this charge separation has a general explanation as a result of interaction between hydroxide(@xmath172 ) and hydronium ( @xmath173 ) ions and a hydrophobic surface @xcite , and the above value of typical charge surface density is observed at liquid water - air surfaces as well as at ice crystal - air surfaces @xcite",
    ". therefore we use the value for ice - vacuum surfaces as well .    in the thundercloud , there are varieties of ice crystals with different surface charge densities , depending on the surface history of the ice crystals .",
    "newly formed surfaces have larger charge surface density than old surfaces , because they have higher fractal dimension and deeper amorphous layers .",
    "we now consider how surface charge exchange works in the model of @xcite .",
    "larger dust that migrate towards the snow line has old surface and has less negative charge surface density , while smaller dust formed at the snow line have new surface and larger negative charge surface density , as in meteorological case .",
    "note that before collision each dust is globally neutral .    at the collision ,",
    "the surface of the dust aggregates melts and the surface charge density is exchanged , and averaged . the larger dust , having less surface charge density than the smaller dust , receives more negative charge than it gives .",
    "therefore the larger dust becomes anionic , smaller dust becomes cationic .",
    "laboratory experiments @xcite , in - situ observations and meteorological estimates @xcite suggest that for mm - size ice crystals , at least @xmath90 per cent of the total surface charge within contact surface is exchanged in a single collision ; experiments by @xcite suggests almost @xmath174 . as a conservative estimate , we use @xmath175 unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "it may be possible that charge separation processes occurring in protoplanetary discs are different from those occurring in the terrestrial thunderclouds .",
    "the collision time - scale in the protoplanetary discs is much longer than that in a thundercloud , so long that sintering may take place . as a result , the surface state of old ice larger dust and young ice smaller dust might resemble each other .",
    "if they are identical , some random charge exchange by collision is still possible , but they do not exchange charge on average .",
    "however , compared to thundercloud , protoplanetary discs are more dirty and fine - grained ; they contain much dust made of materials other than ice such as silicates , and the monomer size is @xmath176 rather than @xmath177 . since the monomer size is smaller than typical skin depth of the charge separation @xmath171 mentioned above , it is possible that ice smaller dust and silicate smaller dust with thin ice mantles formed at the snow line is inefficient in separating charge .",
    "there may be silicate aggregates with no surface charge separation .",
    "meanwhile old larger dust that have travelled from the far end of the protoplanetary disc have undergone sintering and have developed thick mantles with full surface charge separation .    in such scenario ,",
    "the larger dust has more surface charge separation than the smaller dust .",
    "therefore , collision between a larger dust and a smaller dust still leads to charge separation but the larger dust becomes cationic , and the smaller dust is anionic in this case .",
    "we assume that @xmath178 and @xmath179 in this case ( the charge exchange rate has the same magnitude but the opposite sign compared to that of  [ section - surface - charge - exchange - i ] . )    both scenarios , the larger dust is anionic and the larger dust is cationic are plausible .",
    "they may even take place in the different parts of the same disc simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we have decided to take both scenarios into consideration .",
    "to that end , we treat the concept of cationic and anionic dust separately from the size of the dust .",
    "@xcite have proposed that collision between large silicate grains and fine iron metal grains leads to triboelectric charge separation .",
    "for instance , silicate dust of radius @xmath180 will gain @xmath181 charges per dust .",
    "the process can be built into our model in the same manner as we treat surface charge exchange processes .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we justify the two - dust picture introduced in  [ two - component - model ] .",
    "protoplanetary discs consist of dust with various parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the parameter vector @xmath47 may include , but is not limited to , dust radius , porosity , material and surface chemical potential .",
    "we classify these dust into two groups according to their electric tendency ; one is cationic dust who receive positive charge through dust - dust collision and the other is anionic dust who receive negative charge . in this section",
    "we give the precise definition of cationic and anionic dust .",
    "let @xmath58 indicate the number density of the dust with parameter @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 be collisional cross section , mean relative velocity , and mean amount of charge that moves from dust @xmath68 to dust @xmath47 in a collision , respectively .",
    "then we can calculate @xmath185 , charge received by dust @xmath47 per unit time , by @xmath186    we define cationic dust and anionic dust as @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "cationic dust receive net positive charge in dust - dust collision and tend to be cationic , while anionic dust tend to be anionic .",
    "we assume the average dust distribution @xmath189 as that of mmsn model .",
    "we also assume that at some local condensation regions , dust number density is multiplied by carrying in dust from other portions of the disk . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the relative number density @xmath0 is independent of dust parameter @xmath190 so that @xmath191 ( e.g. this is the case when collisional cascade equilibrium is faster than the migration )",
    ". we define @xmath182 and @xmath184 as the value for neutral dust .",
    "as the dust acquires charge , the amount of charge exchanged in a single collision becomes smaller due to the exchange of the charge they already have ; we treat this deviation from neutral dust as separate ` neutralization ' channel . with these assumptions ,",
    "the sign of @xmath185 ( [ q - dot ] ) do not depend on @xmath0 , and the term ` cationic dust ' and ` anionic dust ' is well defined independent of dust number density @xmath0 .",
    "now we can simplify the problem by treat cationic and anionic dust as if they are two discrete kinds of dust .",
    "therefore we define the representative variables for cationic and anionic dust as follows .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe our numerical methods . we need to solve the equilibrium equations ( [ specific - equilibrium - begin]-[specific - equilibrium - end ] ) , for various environmental parameters .",
    "especially we vary @xmath0 for each set of other parameters . then we know the minimum @xmath0 that satisfies the electric discharge condition ( [ equation - macroscopic - discharge ] ) , for the each set of other parameters .",
    "this kind of problem , a massive parameter parallelism , is typically suitable for massively parallel computing hardware ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as general purpose graphic processors ( gpgpus ) or grape - dr @xcite .",
    "we describe the cpu and gpgpu based programmes we used in this research to solve equations ( [ specific - eq - dynamic - begin]-[specific - eq - dynamic - end ] ) in this section .",
    "the most straightforward means of finding the equilibrium solutions ( [ specific - eq - dynamic - begin]-[specific - eq - dynamic - end ] ) is to directly integrate the dynamic equations ( [ specific - eq - dynamic - begin]-[specific - eq - dynamic - end ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , constant - time - step direct integral can not solve ( [ specific - eq - dynamic - begin]-[specific - eq - dynamic - end ] ) correctly for some of the parameter range .",
    "this is because the current densities @xmath63 differ many orders of magnitude for such parameters .",
    "we must choose the integration time - step @xmath193 carefully .",
    "this leads us to the use of a adaptive time step .",
    "the adaptive - time - step direct - integral solver follows the dynamic equations ( [ specific - eq - dynamic - begin]-[specific - eq - dynamic - end ] ) in terms of discretized time @xmath194 where time @xmath194 is incremented by dynamic time - step @xmath193 : @xmath195 our choice of the dynamical time - step @xmath193 is as follows : @xmath196    the direct integral solver is reliable , in sense that it is less prone to implementation mistakes because it almost straightforwardly reflects the equations ( [ specific - eq - dynamic - begin]-[specific - eq - dynamic - end ] ) , and that out of possible many equilibrium solutions ( [ specific - eq - dynamic - begin]-[specific - eq - dynamic - end ] ) the solver will always find the desired equilibrium .",
    "however , as @xmath0 become much larger or much smaller than unity , we have found that charge distribution in the system get unbalanced .",
    "as we try to update the species @xmath47 with little charge but large current , the dynamic time - step @xmath193 ( [ dynamical - timestep - equation ] ) become the time - scale the equilibrium is reached , and the simulations becomes time consuming . use of higher - order integral schemes are futile because we can not take time - step much larger than @xmath193 . in addition to that , floating point numbers mainly available on gpu are single - precision floating point numbers .",
    "computation of double - precision floating point numbers are either not supported or order of magnitude slower on common gpu .",
    "so , we need to find an alternative method to solve the equilibrium equations ( [ specific - equilibrium - begin]-[specific - equilibrium - end ] ) without directly integrating the dynamic equation , avoiding the addition between numbers of different magnitude as long as possible .    binary search is a common method for finding zero point of a one - parameter function @xmath197 ; solving equation @xmath198 for @xmath199 . to solve the system of equations ( [ specific - equilibrium - begin]-[specific - equilibrium - end ] ) , we divide the problem into set of one - parameter problems , and conquer by recursive use of binary search . in doing so",
    ", we have to be careful in choosing which of equations ( [ specific - equilibrium - begin]-[specific - equilibrium - end ] ) we use to find zero point of which freedom @xmath63 .",
    "wrong choice leads to wrong result .",
    "first , @xmath200 and @xmath201 can be analytically expressed in terms of @xmath202 and @xmath203 as follows : @xmath204 where we made abbreviations @xmath205 and so on .",
    "further eliminations of freedoms is possible but complicated , because of complicated and sign - sensitive form of the coulomb cross sections ( [ sigma_coulomb_focusing+]-[sigma_coulomb_focusing- ] ) .",
    "instead we resort to numerical methods to find out the equilibrium solution @xmath202 and @xmath203 for each @xmath0 , and then find @xmath23 , the minimum @xmath0 that satisfies the electric discharge condition ( [ equation - macroscopic - discharge ] ) .",
    "we now describe how to solve the system of equations ( [ specific - kirch - l]),([specific - kirch - s]),([specific - charge - neutrality ] ) , and to find @xmath23 , provided that for any one - parameter @xmath197 we can solve @xmath198 .",
    "let us name the left - hand - sides of equations ( [ specific - kirch - l ] ) , ( [ specific - kirch - s ] ) , ( [ specific - charge - neutrality ] ) as @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 .",
    "we eliminate @xmath200 and @xmath201 from these using ( [ analytic - q - i ] ) and ( [ analytic - q - e ] ) , and regard them as functions of @xmath209 as follows : @xmath210 we have also defined @xmath211 according to ( [ equation - macroscopic - discharge ] ) .    for each fixed set of @xmath0 and @xmath203 , @xmath212 is a one - parameter function of @xmath202 . according to the assumption we can solve @xmath213 for @xmath202 .",
    "we define @xmath214 to denote the solution , so that @xmath215 holds .",
    "then for each fixed @xmath0 , @xmath216 is a one - parameter function of @xmath203 . according to the assumption",
    "we can solve @xmath217 for @xmath203 .",
    "we define @xmath218 to denote the solution , so that @xmath219 holds .",
    "then @xmath220 is a one - parameter function of @xmath0 . according to the assumption",
    "we can solve @xmath221 for @xmath0 .",
    "we define @xmath222 to denote the solution , so that @xmath223 holds , which is the @xmath23 we are looking for .    with this method ,",
    "whenever a solver approaches the zero point of one of @xmath197 , the @xmath197 will consist of two or more terms of same magnitude , and of other terms of smaller magnitude .",
    "smaller terms are irrelevant to the equilibrium .",
    "so we will always be comparing the terms of same magnitude .",
    "because of this , the method gives sufficiently precise solutions even with single precision floating point numbers .",
    "graphic processing units ( gpus ) are processors specialized for computer graphics , widely used in personal computers , workstations , and video game devices . but as more and more realistic computer graphics have been demanded , gpus became capable of more and more types of calculations , and finally evolved into general purpose graphic processing units ( gpgpus ) , who are programmable for general computation , not limited to graphic processing . due to the nature of graphic processing tasks , gpus parallel computation capacities are are one or two orders of magnitude larger compared to that of cpus . on the other hand marketplace competition and mass production keep the gpus price low .",
    "although parallel programming has been a hard task for programmers , the parallelism found in nature , together with gpgpu s power and price makes it very alluring as next generation computational platform for computational astrophysics , and computational natural science .",
    "use of gpgpu have already started in several fields of astronomy and astrophysics , such as signal processing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , n - body simulations of gravity ( e.g. * ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gravitational lensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , orbital dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radiation - transfer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also in various other branches of science ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with gpgpu we can challenge problems that had been computationally formidable . to begin this challenge ,",
    "we have constructed _ tengu _ , ( * ten*mon-*g*pgp*u * cluster ; gpgpu cluster for astrophysical purposes .",
    "it consists of 10 computer nodes , each equipped with nvidia s gpgpu .",
    "we use the programming language to write codes for gpgpus .",
    "is compatible with , so we benefit both from expressive power of and computational power of gpgpus .    thanks to this , we organize our c++ and cuda codes in the following way .",
    "we made classes representing the protoplanetary disc , dust plasma , problem initial conditions and solutions , and the numerical solvers .",
    "each solver inherit from an abstract solver class .",
    "thus the users of the solvers , namely the programme parts that carries out tests and numerical experiments can use any solver they prefer , without noticing what algorithm the solvers use nor on what hardware they run .",
    "we write most of the code in c++ and compile them by gcc .",
    "the gpgpu related details are separated in several * .cu * files by means of pimpl idiom .",
    "we compile * .cu * files and link the object files using nvcc , cuda compiler provided by nvidia .",
    "another example of such benefit is thrust ( http://code.google.com/p/thrust/ ) , a cuda counterpart of what standard template library ( stl ) is in c++ . with thrust , for example",
    ", device and host memory management is automated .",
    "memories are allocated and freed automatically in the constructor and destructor of the container classes .",
    "copying data between host memory and device memory are simply expressed by substitution @xmath224 operators .",
    "we choose the test - driven development style for this study .",
    "we have tested that the charge conservation and the current conservation conditions are held , for each equilibrium solution that each solver give .",
    "we have also tested that the value of the currents satisfy equations by comparing them with the simplest implementation .    why do we test our codes ?",
    "we need tests in numerical physics because the codes must compile correctly , the codes must translate the algorithms correctly , and algorithms represent the physical concepts correctly .    in order to assure these ,",
    "we are accustomed to perform various tests during a code development , by examining the internal states and outputs of the programme .",
    "furthermore , we want to make sure that criteria once tested always meet thereafter , and that the tests cover all the important aspects of the code .",
    "as the code grow , it becomes more and more effective to build up a system of test rather than to perform tests manually .",
    "this technique is known as test - driven development ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the programme is divided into many functional modules , and we test that these modules give expected output for given input .",
    "this is compared to code - reading style of tests , where testers finds faults in the code by reading them .",
    "although code reading is capable of finding more mistakes @xcite it is only effective when the code is short and it is possible to trace the comprehensive behaviour of the code line - by - line .",
    "unit tests , on the other hand cares only on the input and output .",
    "it is effective even if we are trying new languages or hardware , or we can not debug trace on them .",
    "we use googletest , google s framework for writing automated c++ tests ( http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ ) .",
    "we must also consider the time cost of the test . because we do computationally heavy tasks , examining the entire behaviour of the programme",
    "is not practical . with systematized tests",
    ", we can ensure the equivalence of the codes as we optimize them , or as we transplant it onto another language or hardware .",
    "we further construct a ` test ladder , ' an analog of distance ladder in cosmology .",
    "we develop a chain of successively faster algorithms , and feed them with randomly generated inputs and check if their response is same up to required precision . at the one end of the ladder is a code that almost directly trace the equations , correctness of whose implementation is self - evident . at the other end of the ladder is optimized , massively parallel code running on gpgpu .",
    "finally , we evaluate the computational optimization achieved by measuring the speed of each solvers in terms of how many problems they solve per wall clock time .",
