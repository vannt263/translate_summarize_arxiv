    "@xcite the majorana qp and majorana fermionic operator are defined by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , which imply that the particle and antiparticle are identical .",
    "it has been proposed that the majorana nature brings new physics , such as non - abelian statistics of vortices in chiral superfluids  @xcite and ising - like spin dynamics for time - reversal invariant superfluids .",
    "@xcite the majorana nature itself is an intriguing subject to further studies .",
    "candidate systems that exhibit the majorana nature are quite rare , e.g. , spin - triplet superconductors or superfluids , @xmath4-wave feshbach resonated superfluids ,  @xcite fractional quantum hall systems with the 5/2 filling ,  @xcite interfaces between a topological insulator and an @xmath5-wave superconductor ,  @xcite and @xmath5-wave superfluids with particular spin - orbit interactions .",
    "@xcite    spin - triplet superconductors or superfluids satisfy the following bogoliubov - de gennes equation with the wave function @xmath6 and the energy @xmath7 : @xmath8 the eigenstates yield one - to - one mapping between the positive energy states @xmath9 and the negative energy states @xmath10 owing to the symmetry @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the pauli matrix in the particle - hole space .",
    "the symmetry of the wave function leads to the relation of the bogoliubov qp operator @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the bogoliubov qp with zero - energy is the majorana qp , @xmath14 .",

    "the order parameter ( op ) of the a - phase has point nodes toward @xmath1-vector , which signifies the direction of the orbital angular momentum , or orbital chirality , whereas the b - phase has a full gap .",

    "the difference of time reversal symmetry between the a- and b - phases is analogous to the difference between the quantum hall state and the quantum spin hall state .",

    "<S> consequently the influence on the majorana zero modes from the spatial variation of @xmath1-vector for the a - phase in thick slabs and the energy splitting of the zero - energy quasi - particles for the b - phase confined in thin slabs are demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the corner of slabs in the b - phase is accompanied by the unique zero - energy ldos of corner modes . on the basis of the quantitative calculation , </S>",
    "<S> we propose several feasible and verifiable experiments to check the existence of the majorana surface states , such as the measurement of specific heat , edge current , and anisotropic spin susceptibility . </S>"
