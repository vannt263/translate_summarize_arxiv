    "the study of molecular nanojunctions built from simple molecules has attracted wide interest in recent years.@xcite contrary to more complex molecular electronics structures , the behaviour of some simple molecules bridging atomic - sized metallic junctions can already be understood in great detail , including the number of conductance channel analysis with conductance fluctuation and shot - noise measurements,@xcite the identification of various vibrational modes with point - contact spectroscopy @xcite and the quantitative predictive power of computer simulations.@xcite the above methods were successfully used to describe platinum - hydrogen junctions : it was shown that a molecular hydrogen bridge with a single , perfectly transmitting channel is formed between the platinum electrodes.@xcite    point - contact spectroscopy turned out to be an especially useful tool in the study of molecular nanojunctions , as a fingerprint of the molecular vibrational modes can be given by simply identifying the small steplike signals in the @xmath0 curves of the junction.@xcite however , the detection of the small vibrational signals is difficult for junctions with partially transmitting conductance channels , where quantum interference ( qi ) fluctuations may give an order of a magnitude larger signal.@xcite surprisingly , instead of observing small steplike vibrational signals upon the background of qi fluctuations , molecular nanojunctions frequently show peaklike structures in the differential conductance curves with amplitudes comparable to or even much larger than the qi fluctuations .",
    "the peaks can be either positive or negative and their amplitude can be as small as a few percents , but  as we demonstrate in this manuscript ",

    "it can be stated that at low bias the conductance starts from a constant value , at a certain threshold voltage the peaklike structure is observed , and at higher bias the conductance saturates at a constant value again . the high - bias conductance plateau can be either higher or lower than the low - bias plateau . in the first case",
    "the peak at the transition energy is positive , whereas in the second case it is negative . in other words ,",
    "the junction shows linear @xmath1 characteristics both at low and high biases but with a different slope , and at the threshold energy a sharp transition occurs between the two slopes .",

    "the broad distribution of the ndc peak positions also indicates that the phenomenon is not related to vibrational energies .    in our view",
    "the vibrationally mediated tls model requires unique circumstances : the molecule needs to be really incorporated in the junction with well - defined vibrational energies .",
    "furthermore , two similar configurations are required , which have the same vibrational energy , and for which the transition is only possible in the excited state .",
    "this phenomenon may be general in certain well - defined molecular junctions , for which the transition of a vibrational - like signal to a peaklike structure and the isotope shift of the peaks provides support .",
    "in contrast , the asymmetrically coupled tls model can be imagined under a much broader range of experimental conditions , just a bound molecular configuration and a large number of energetically similar loosely bound ( e.g. desorbed ) states are required with some difference in the conductance .",
    "the fine details of the underlying physical phenomena may differ from system to system , however both models provide an illustration of a physical process that may lead to the appearance of peaklike structures in @xmath2 curves of molecular junctions .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that gold - hydrogen nanojunctions exhibit huge negative differential conductance in the conductance range of @xmath10g@xmath6 .",
    "the position of the peaks shows a broad distribution in the energy range @xmath11mev .",
    "similar features were observed in tunnel junctions with higher resistance using an stm setup,@xcite whereas in break - junctions with @xmath154g@xmath6 peaklike structures with smaller amplitude were detected.@xcite these results show that sharp peaklike structures are generally observed in the differential conductance curves of molecular nanojunctions under a wide range of experimental conditions : using different molecules , different electrode material and different contact sizes .",
    "all these experimental results imply the explanation of the observations in terms of two - level system models .",
    "we have shown that a simple two - level system model can not produce peaklike structures , but a tls model with asymmetric coupling successfully fits all the experimental data .",
    "our analysis shows that the peaklike curves correspond to large asymmetry parameters , which implies that a molecule from a bound state is excited to a large number of energetically similar loosely bound states .",
    "this picture provides a physical phenomenon that can appear under a wide range of experimental conditions and may explain the frequent occurrence of peaklike structures in @xmath2 curves of various molecular systems .",
    "our analysis also shows that a recently proposed vibrationally mediated two - level system model@xcite may be applicable for certain well - defined molecular configurations , but the general relation of the conductance peaks to vibrational modes is not possible without further experimental evidences .",
    "this work has been supported by the hungarian research funds otka f049330 , ts049881 .",
    "a.  halbritter is a grantee of the bolyai jnos scholarship .",
    "we have found that the model is not sensitive to the choice of the distribution , all the distributions with a well - defined width ( e.g. gaussian ) provide similar results .",
    "note , that according to the general definition @xmath88 is always the standard deviation and not the width of the distribution ."
