    "quantum coherence or interference effectively influences the property of refraction and absorption in the phase - coherent atomic ensemble@xcite .",
    "when laser resonantly interacts with atoms , the coherence can lead to electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit)@xcite , electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) @xcite , coherent population trapping ( cpt)5 and the enhanced refractive index effect@xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been widely studied in the typical @xmath1- and @xmath2-type three - level atomic systems .",
    "recently , the coherently prepared degenerate atomic ensemble attracts great interest .",
    "the cpt in multilevel dark states was experimentally explored in the ground hyperfine states of @xmath3rb atoms@xcite .",
    "eit and eia have been observed in the degenerate systems due to the atomic coherence among zeeman sublevels belonging to the same hyperfine splitting@xcite . in this paper , we use the optical bloch equations to study quantum coherence effects induced by the competition between the coupling field and zeeman splitting in a degenerate two - level atomic ensemble .    since quantum coherence",
    "greatly enhances the refractive index and induces the transparency , the study on the light propagation in a superluminal and subluminal group velocity is ignited .",
    "wang et al . realized the superluminal and negative group velocity propagation of light pulses by using the lossless linear anomalous dispersion between two closely spaced gain lines@xcite .",
    "the experiments have shown that light pulses were greatly slowed down , halted , and restarted in a coherently prepared atomic media10,11,12,13,14 .",
    "theoretically , by changing the intensity of the lower level coupling field in a @xmath1-type ensemble@xcite and adjusting the phases of two weak optical fields in a @xmath2-type ensemble@xcite , the group velocity of a light pulse is controlled , so the transition from subluminal to superluminal light propagation is predicted . in a coherently prepared degenerate two - level atomic system ,",
    "steep anomalous and normal dispersion were observed@xcite .",
    "the degenerate systems should show more ability to adjust the sign of dispersion due to the coherence between the coupling field and zeeman splitting .",
    "motivated by that , in this work , we also investigate the positive and negative dispersion in a degenerate two - level ensemble .    in the following ,",
    "the simplest degenerate two - level atomic system is considered . for a transition @xmath4 driven by a circularly",

    ", we drive the atomic system by a linear polarized @xmath8 light with frequency @xmath5 and probe it by a left and right circularly polarized @xmath9 light with @xmath6 . now the system becomes a double @xmath1-type one . in the presence of the magnetic field , eit , eia , and the transition from positive to negative dispersion",

    "is predicted due to the steep normal and anomalous dispersion .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath19 or @xmath20 , the coherence between the coupling field and zeeman splitting becomes weak , the results of degenerate two - level systems appear , and only eit and positive dispersion are observed .",
    "finally , we find that cpt is not highly sensitive to the refraction and absorption in such two - level systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we set up the model and present its optical bloch equations , which can be expressed as a set of linear equations of fourier amplitudes . in section iii , we solve these linear equations numerically and discuss the quantum coherence effects due to the competition between the coupling field and zeeman splitting .",

    "1 , a @xmath21 transition is set up . this transition can be experimentally realized by using the @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 transition of sm@xcite and the @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 transition of ne@xmath29@xcite .",

    "note here eit , positive dispersion and cpt effects are purely induced by the linearly polarized coupling @xmath8 light . in the presence of the magnetic field ,",
    "the degenerate state @xmath120 with the energy level @xmath121 splits into three ones : @xmath118 with @xmath122 and @xmath7 with @xmath123 .",
    "when the intensity of the drive field is varied , due to the existence of zeeman splitting , it will experience a great changes in the refraction , absorption and cpt .",
    "the subsequent numerical calculations are performed to discuss the quantum coherence effects , which are induced by the competition between the drive rabi frequency and zeeman splitting .",
    "it is known that in many ensembles the intensity of coupling field can be used to control the quantum coherence effects@xcite . in the subsequent figures , by means of changing the intensity of the coupling field , the quantum coherence effects between the drive rabi frequency and the zeeman splitting are shown .",
    "when @xmath124 is very small compared with the zeeman splitting @xmath125 , i.e. , @xmath126the existence of the coupling field will not be enough to influence the properties of the ensemble . as shown in fig .",

    "simultaneously , there are larger changes in cpt states comparing with the previous case . when we continue to increase @xmath124 ,",
    "let it be two times of zeeman splitting , i.e. @xmath129 , we find that eit and positive dispersion occurs at three frequencies : @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "the corresponding populations @xmath15 and @xmath16 oscillate at @xmath17 in a wide spectral region of the detuning @xmath117 .",
    "the cycle of oscillation is @xmath132 .",
    "this phenomenon results from the coherence effect between the drive filed and the zeeman splitting@xcite .",
    "this kind of coherence has been discussed in the ref . [ 24 ] , while the oscillation of populations was not mentioned . at last ,",
    "when the drive rabi frequency @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the presence of the magnetic field , both eit and eia arise due to the coherence between @xmath124 and zeeman splitting .    here",
    "positive and negative dispersions at the zero detuning , @xmath134 are emphasized .",
    "we observe the transition from positive , via negative , to positive dispersion from the features of refraction in figures 3 , 4 and 5 . since the group velocity @xmath135 can be expressed as @xmath136@xcite , the transition from subluminal to superluminal light propagation is predicted .",
    "we have noted this transition in a @xmath1-type ensemble by changing the intensity of the lower level coupling field@xcite and in a @xmath2-type ensemble by adjusting the phases of two weak optical fields@xcite . in the presence of magnetic field ,",
    "the ensemble becomes a real four - level system , or a superposition of two @xmath1-type ensembles . due to the existence of zeeman sublevel @xmath7 ,",
    "the system becomes more adjustable , so that the changing of @xmath137 can lead to the positive and negative dispersions .",
    "therefore this kind of system is suitable to unify the subluminal and superluminal light propagation .",
    "cpt states in the excited level and zeeman sublevels are shown in these figures . in all figures , at @xmath90 , the populations @xmath15 and @xmath138 approximately equal to @xmath17 while @xmath139 and @xmath140 are approximately zero .",

    "the quantum coherent result is different , in that , at the detuning center the ratio @xmath141 is large and can reach the maximum @xmath142 .",
    "finally , we find that cpt states are not sensitively related to the refraction and absorption in such ensemble .",
    "the opposite case is complemented , where the atomic system is driven by a left and right circularly polarized @xmath9 light with @xmath143 and probed by a linear polarized @xmath8 light with @xmath6 .",
    "analogous to the system driven by a @xmath8 light and probed by a @xmath144 light , it is also a double @xmath1-type ensemble . at the degenerate case",
    ", it should exhibit the same property as what found in previous , i.e. , eit and positive dispersion , which have been verified by further numerical calculations .",
    "however , when the magnetic field is added to the ensemble , there exist more than three dominant frequencies : @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 and so on , so that it is very difficult to obtain the fourier amplitudes . for this system",
    ", it should exhibit the same quantum coherence effects as what discussed in the previous part of the paper . in ref .",
    "[ 17 ] , a transition @xmath148 driven and probed by a circularly polarized light is investigated . at that case , though the existence of the state @xmath7 the system is still a @xmath1-type one , so only positive or negative dispersion  and eit are found .",
