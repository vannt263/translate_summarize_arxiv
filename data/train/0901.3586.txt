    "the emphasis of this review , which is a substantially extended version of les houches session _ lxxxi _ lectures  @xcite , is on the functional integration approach .",

    "our intent is not to cover all applications of the technique that have appeared previously in the literature .",
    "we rather aim at a systematic and self  contained exposition , helpful for beginners .",
    "the choice of cited literature is therefore very partial and subjective .",
    "it is mainly intended to provide more in  depth details about the chosen examples , rather than a comprehensive literature guide .",
    "the outline of the present review is as follows .",

    "this example is used to establish connections with the classical methods ( langevin , fokker  planck , martin  siggia",

    "consider a quantum many ",
    "body system governed by a ( possibly time ",
    "dependent ) hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that in the distant past @xmath2 the system was in a state , specified by a many  body density matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the precise form of the latter is of no importance .",
    "it may be , e.g. , the equilibrium density matrix associated with the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the density matrix evolves according to the von neumann equation @xmath5 $ ] , where we set @xmath6 .",
    "it is formally solved by @xmath7^{\\dag}= \\hat{\\mathcal{u}}_{t,-\\infty}\\hat{\\rho}(-\\infty ) \\hat{\\mathcal{u}}_{-\\infty , t}$ ] , where the evolution operator is given by the time  ordered exponent : @xmath8 where an infinitesimal time - step is @xmath9 .",
    "one is usually interested in calculations of expectation value for some observable @xmath10 ( say density or current ) at a time @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12 where the traces are performed over the many ",
    "body hilbert space .",
    "the expression under the last trace describes ( read from right to left ) evolution from @xmath2 , where the initial density matrix is specified , forward to @xmath11 , where the observable is calculated , and then backward to @xmath2 .",
    "such forward  backward evolution is avoided in the equilibrium by a specially designed trick .",
    "let us recall how it works , for example , in the zero  temperature quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "the latter deals with the expectation values of the type @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a ground state of full interacting system .",
    "the only time dependence allowed for the hamiltonian is an adiabatic switching of interactions on and off in the distant past and future , respectively .",
    "the evolution operator therefore describes the evolution of a simple non  interacting ground state @xmath15 toward @xmath16 upon adiabatic switching of the interactions .",
    "now comes the trick : one inserts the operator @xmath17 in the left  most position to accomplish the evolution along the entire time axis .",
    "it is then argued that @xmath18 .",
    "this argument is based on the assumption that the system adiabatically follows its ground state upon slow switching of the interactions `` on '' and `` off '' in the distant past and future , respectively .",
    "therefore , the only result of evolving the non  interacting ground  state along the entire time axis is acquiring a phase factor @xmath19 .",
    "one can then compensate for the added evolution segment by dividing this factor out . as the result : @xmath20 and one faces description of the evolution along the forward time axis without the backward segment .",
    "however , it comes with the price : one has to take care of the denominator ( which amounts to subtracting of the so  called disconnected diagrams ) .",
    "such a trick does not work in a non  equilibrium situation with a truly time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian .",
    "if the system was driven out of equilibrium , then the final state of its evolution does not have to coincide with the initial one .",
    "in general , such a final state depends on the peculiarities of the switching procedure as well as on the entire history of the system .",
    "thus , one can not get rid of the backward portion of the evolution history contained in  .",
    "schwinger  @xcite was the first to realize that this is not an unsurmountable obstacle .",
    "one has to accept that the evolution in the non  equilibrium quantum field theory takes place along the closed time contour .",
    "along with the conventional forward path , the latter contains the backward path . in this way",
    "one avoids the need to know the state of the system at @xmath21 .",
    "it is still convenient to extend the evolution in   to @xmath21 and back to @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to mention that this operation is identical and does not require any additional assumptions .",
    "inserting @xmath22 to the left of @xmath10 in  , one obtains @xmath23 here we also used that , according to the von neumann equation , the trace of the density matrix is unchanged under the unitary evolution . as a result , we have obtained the evolution along the closed time contour @xmath24 depicted in figure  [ fig - contour ] .    .",
    "dots on the forward and the backward branches of the contour denote discrete time points .",
    "[ fig - contour],width=377 ]    the observable @xmath10 is inserted at time @xmath11 , somewhere along the forward branch of the contour .",
    "note that inserting the unit operator @xmath22 to the right of @xmath10 , we could equally well arrange to have an observable on the backward branch of the contour . as we show below",
    ", the most convenient choice is to take a half  sum of these two equivalent representations .",
    "the observable may be also generated by adding to the hamiltonian a source term @xmath25 , where the plus ( minus ) signs refer to the forward ( backward ) parts of the contour .",
    "one needs to calculate then the generating functional @xmath26 $ ] defined as the trace of the evolution operator along the contour @xmath24 with the hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "since the latter is non ",
    "symmetric on the two branches , such a closed contour evolution operator is not identical to unity .",
    "the expectation value of the observable may then be generated as the result of functional differentiation @xmath28/\\delta\\eta(t)|_{\\eta=0}$ ] .",
    "we first omit the source term and develop a convenient representation for the partition function @xmath29\\equiv\\frac{\\tr\\{\\hat{\\mathcal{u}}_{\\mathcal{c}}\\hat{\\rho}(-\\infty)\\ } } { \\tr\\{\\hat{\\rho}(-\\infty)\\}}=1\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "the source term , breaking the forward ",
    "backward symmetry , will be discussed at a later stage .",
    "note that since @xmath31=1 $ ] , the observable may be equally well written in the form , which is more familiar from the equilibrium context : @xmath32/\\delta\\eta(t)|_{\\eta=0}$ ] .",
    "the logarithm is _ optional _ in the theory with the closed time contour .",
    "the need to carry the evolution along the two  branch contour complicates the non  equilibrium theory in comparison with the equilibrium theory .",
    "the difficulties may be substantially reduced by a proper choice of variables based on the forward ",
    "backward symmetry of the theory .",
    "there are also good news : there is no denominator @xmath19 , unavoidably present in the single  branch contour theory .",
    "( one should not worry about @xmath33 in  ( [ contour - z-0 ] ) .",
    "indeed , this quantity refers entirely to @xmath2 , before the interactions were adiabatically switched `` on '' . as a result",
    ", it is trivially calculated and never represents a problem . )",
    "the absence of the denominator dramatically simplifies description of systems with the quenched disorder .",
    "it is the denominator , @xmath19 , which is the main obstacle in performing the disorder averaging of the expectation values of observables . to overcome",
    "this obstacle the replica  @xcite and the supersymmetry  @xcite tricks were invented . in the closed time contour theory",
    "the denominator is absent and thus there is no need in any of these tricks .",
    "let us consider the simplest many ",
    "body system : bosonic particles occupying a single quantum state with energy @xmath34 .",
    "its secondary quantized hamiltonian has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are bosonic creation and annihilation operators with the commutation relation @xmath38=1 $ ] .",
    "let us define the partition function as @xmath39 if one assumes that all external fields are exactly the same on the forward and backward branches of the contour , then @xmath40 and , therefore , @xmath41 .",
    "the initial density matrix @xmath42 is some operator  valued function of the hamiltonian . to simplify the derivations",
    "one may choose it to be the equilibrium density matrix , @xmath43 . since arbitrary external perturbations may be switched on ( and off ) at a later time , the choice of the equilibrium initial density matrix does not prevent one from treating non  equilibrium dynamics . for the equilibrium initial density matrix",

    "an important point is that , in general , @xmath46 is an interaction- and disorder  independent constant .",
    "indeed , both interactions and disorder are supposed to be switched on ( and off ) on the forward ( backward ) parts of the contour sometime after ( before ) @xmath2 .",
    "this constant is , therefore , frequently omitted without causing a confusion .",
    "the next step is to divide the @xmath24 contour into @xmath47 time",
    " steps of length @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 as shown in figure  [ fig - contour ] .",
    "one then inserts the resolution of unity in the over  complete coherent state basis ( @xmath51 ) , parameterized by a complex number @xmath52 , is defined as a right ( left ) eigenstate of the annihilation ( creation ) operator : @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "matrix elements of a _ normally ordered _ operator , such as hamiltonian , take the form @xmath55 .",
    "the overlap between two coherent states is @xmath56 .",
    "since the coherent state basis is over  complete , the trace of an operator , @xmath57 , is calculated with the weight : @xmath58 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath59 at each point @xmath60 along the contour .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 one obtains the following sequence in the expression for @xmath62 ( read from right to left ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the evolution operator during the time interval @xmath48 in the positive ( negative ) time direction .",
    "its matrix elements are given by : @xmath65 where the approximate equalities are valid up to the linear order in @xmath48 .",
    "obviously this result is not restricted to the toy example  , but holds for any _ normally ordered _ hamiltonian .",
    "note that there is no evolution operator inserted between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , these two points are physically indistinguishable and thus the system does not evolve during this time interval . employing the following properties of coherent states : @xmath56 along with @xmath68 , and collecting all of the matrix elements along the contour , one finds for the partition function  , @xmath69 \\exp\\left(i\\sum\\limits^{2n}_{j , j\\,'=1}\\bar{\\phi}_{j}\\ , g^{-1}_{jj\\,'}\\,\\phi_{j\\,'}\\right)\\ , , \\ ] ] where the @xmath70 matrix @xmath71 stands for @xmath72\\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath73 .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate the determinant of such a matrix @xmath74=(-1)^{2n } - \\rho(\\omega_0)(1-h^2)^{n-1}\\approx 1-\\rho(\\omega_0)\\ , e^{(\\omega_0\\delta_t)^2(n-1)}\\to 1- \\rho(\\omega_0 ) \\",

    "note that keeping the upper ",
    "right element of the discrete matrix   is crucial to maintaining this normalization identity .",
    "one may now take the limit @xmath76 and formally write the partition function in the continuum notations , @xmath80 , as @xmath81\\ , \\exp\\left(is[\\bar{\\phi},\\phi]\\right)=\\int\\d[\\bar{\\phi}\\phi ] \\exp\\left(i\\int_{\\mathcal{c}}\\d t \\",

    "thus , the continuum form of the operator @xmath84 is @xmath85 it is important to remember that this continuum notation is only an abbreviation that represents the large discrete matrix  . in particular , the upper ",
    "right element of the matrix ( the last term in  ) , which contains the information about the distribution function , is seemingly absent in the continuum notation  .    to avoid integration along the closed time contour",

    "once again , the continuum notations are somewhat misleading .",
    "indeed , they create an undue impression that @xmath87 and @xmath88 fields are completely uncorrelated . in fact , they are correlated owing to the presence of the non  zero off ",
    "diagonal blocks in the discrete matrix  .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop a continuum representation that automatically takes into account the proper regularization .",
