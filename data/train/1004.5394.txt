    "<S> we introduce and study a class of discrete - time quantum walks on a one - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the standard homogeneous quantum walks , coin operators are inhomogeneous and depend on their positions in this class of models . </S>",
    "<S> the models are shown to be self - dual with respect to the fourier transform , which is analogous to the aubry - andr model describing the one - dimensional tight - binding model with a quasi - periodic potential . when the period of coin operators is incommensurate to the lattice spacing , we rigorously show that the limit distribution of the quantum walk is localized at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we also numerically study the eigenvalues of the one - step time evolution operator and find the hofstadter butterfly spectrum which indicates the fractal nature of this class of quantum walks . </S>"
