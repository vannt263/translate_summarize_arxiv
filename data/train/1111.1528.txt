    "    perovskite transition - metal oxides challenge electronic structure theory since several decades , due to the variety of collective structural , electronic , and magnetic phenomena which are responsible for the formation of complex orbital- and spin - ordered states  @xcite .",
    "a prototypical textbook example of this class of materials is the antiferromagnetic insulator lamno@xmath1 .",
    "the ground state electronic structure of lamno@xmath1 is characterized by the crystal - field induced breaking of the degeneracy of the mn@xmath3 3@xmath4 manifold in the high - spin configuration ( @xmath5)@xmath6(@xmath0)@xmath7 , with the @xmath5 orbitals lying lower in energy than the two - fold degenerate @xmath0 ones . due to the strong hund s rule coupling ,",
    "the spins of the fully occupied majority @xmath5 orbitals are aligned parallel with the spin of the singly occupied majority @xmath0 states on the same site .",
    "the orbital degeneracy in the @xmath0 channel is further lifted via cooperative jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions  @xcite , manifested by long and short mn - o octahedral bonds alternating along the conventional orthorhombic basal plane , which are accompanied by gdfeo@xmath1-type ( gfo ) checkerboard tilting and rotations of the oxygen octahedra  @xcite ( see ) . as a result",
    ", the ideal cubic perovskite structure is strongly distorted into an orthorhombic structure with @xmath8 symmetry  @xcite , and a @xmath9-type orbital - ordered ( oo ) state emerges  @xcite . the corresponding occupied @xmath0 orbital",
    "can be written as @xmath10@xcite , with the sign of @xmath11 alternating along @xmath12 and @xmath13 and repeating along @xmath14 .",
    "this particular orbital ordering is responsible for the observed a - type antiferromagnetic arrangement below @xmath15  k  @xcite .",
    "it was found that long - range order disappears above 750  k , whereas a local jt distortion ( without long - range order ) remains ( dynamically ) active up to @xmath16 1150  k  @xcite .",
    "small red and light blue spheres indicate oxygen and manganese atoms , respectively , whereas the larger spheres refer to the la atoms .",
    "plot done using the vesta visualization program  @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the question of whether the origin of orbital ordering should be attributed to a superexchange mechanism ( o - mediated virtual hopping of electrons between nearest neighbor @xmath17 mn cations , associated with a local coulomb electron - electron interaction : @xmath18 )  @xcite or to an electron - lattice coupling effect ( structural - induced splitting of the degenerate @xmath0 levels )  @xcite has been the subject of numerous studies  @xcite .",
    "considering that there is no clear experimental evidence to support one mechanism over the other , the employment of theoretical models and computer simulations has become an essential tool to explain the complicated coupling between structural and electronic degrees of freedom and to interpret the experimental observations .",
    "on the basis of model calculations , it has been recognized that the simultaneous inclusion of both superexchange and jt interactions is crucial to provide , to some extent , a satisfactory description of the observed transition temperatures @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "this approach typically relies on a suitable mapping between a realistic band structure calculated e.g. via density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite and an effective many - body hamiltonian , which is often achieved by downfolding the relevant bands and constructing a localized wannier basis  @xcite .",
    "the quality and characteristics of the wannier representation inevitably depend on the underlying kohn - sham states .",
    "it is well known that the mean - field - type one - particle description of the electronic structure within the standard local density ( lda )  @xcite or generalized gradient ( gga )  @xcite approximations to dft is incapable to correctly describe exchange and correlation effects in the so called _ strongly - correlated materials _ , resulting , among other failures in much too small band gaps and magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the dft - derived subset of orbitals is typically employed as reference for the one - electron ( i.e. non - interacting ) part of the effective hamiltonian , where all approximated contributions coming from lda / gga exchange - correlation effects are subtracted in order to avoid double - counting  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the dft+dmft method ( combination of dft and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) )  @xcite , the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the kohn - sham hamiltonian , @xmath24 accounts for the double - counting correction , and @xmath25 represents the hubbard - like term which describes the electronic interactions in the strongly correlated bands .",
    "a critical issue of the dft+dmft approach is that a well defined expression for the double - counting potential is not known and several forms have been suggested  @xcite .",
    "karolak and coworkers have recently addressed this issue by treating the double - counting term as an adjustable parameter and suggested that the best agreement with experiment is achieved by setting the double - counting potential in the middle of the gap of the impurity spectral function  @xcite . within this context , it is therefore justified to construct effective hamiltonians starting from band structures obtained using different schemes , such as e.g. lda@xmath26  @xcite or hybrid functionals  @xcite , which usually provide much better gaps for semiconducting materials than conventional dft approximations and could therefore represent a more appropriate `` non - interacting '' reference for model calculations .    for practical purposes , the most suitable starting point to study the physics of complex transition - metal oxides is probably the tight - binding ( tb ) scheme , which relies on a proper representation of the electronic structure using a localized basis set  @xcite .",
    "some of the authors have recently shown that maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) can be used to extract an effective tb description of the @xmath0 subspace in lamno@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the calculated tb parameters can then be used to construct a simplified tb hamiltonian in the form that is very often used for the description of manganites , @xmath27 , which then provides a very accurate representation of the underlying kohn - sham band structure .    motivated by the reasons outlined above , here we calculate mlwfs for lamno@xmath1 using several different methods , including both the conventional gga scheme and the more sophisticated gga@xmath26 , hybrid functionals , and gw approaches .",
    "besides providing a detailed description of the electronic and magnetic properties of lamno@xmath1 at various levels of theory , we investigate how the corresponding differences in the treatment of exchange - correlation effects influence the specific features of the mlwfs and the tb parameters derived from them .    ",
    "all our calculations are based on dft within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite ( pbe ) approximation to the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "the one - particle kohn - sham orbitals are computed within a plane - wave basis employing two different codes : ( i ) the program pwscf in combination with ultrasoft pseudopotentials included in the quantum espresso package  @xcite , and ( ii ) the projector augmented wave  @xcite ( paw ) based vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite . in particular , the pwscf program is used to benchmark the implementation of the vasp2wannier90 interface at pbe and pbe@xmath26 level . due to the well known limitations of standard dft in describing the electronic structure of `` strongly - correlated '' compounds , three different corrections to the pbe wavefunctions are adopted : ( i ) pbe@xmath26 : inclusion of a repulsive on - site coulomb interaction @xmath2 following the recipe of dudarev et al .",

    "five iterations were sufficient to obtain quasiparticle energies converged to about 0.05 ev .",
    "these four methodologies ( pbe , pbe+u , hse and gw ) differ in a few fundamental issues : ( i ) pbe relies on an approximate treatment of exchange - correlation effects ; ( ii ) pbe+u contains the same pbe approximate correlation , but takes into account orbital dependence ( applied to the @xmath9 states of manganese ) of the coulomb and exchange interactions which is absent in the pbe ; ( iii ) hse includes a portion of non - local fully orbital dependent exact exchange and pbe correlation ( iv ) in gw exchange and correlation contributions are directly computed from the self - energy .",

    "we note that this difference is almost entirely due to the difference in the corresponding pbe results .",
    "the @xmath2-induced changes in the magnetic coupling constant @xmath84 relative to the @xmath97 reference are nearly identical within the two codes .",
    "( iv ) while @xmath98 within hse and pbe+@xmath2(vasp ) are very similar for @xmath2 between 2 - 3  ev , the ratio between @xmath84 and @xmath82 is rather different within the two approaches .",
    "( v ) within the limitations regarding the applicability of a heisenberg picture to lamno@xmath1 stated above , hse seems to be most consistent with the values of the magnetic coupling constants derived from neutron diffraction measurements of spin - wave spectra  @xcite and magnon data  @xcite .",
    "this further confirms the predictive power of hse in describing exchange interactions in transition metal oxides , as compared to other available beyond - dft schemes  @xcite .",
    "we can also see that all methods result in values for the local magnetic moments of the mn cation that are within the range of variation of the experimental data .",
    "generally , increasing @xmath2 within pbe+@xmath2 leads to a more localized magnetization density compared to pbe , and thus increases the local magnetic moments .    on the basis of the above analysis both of the electronic and magnetic properties of lamno@xmath1",

    "o(@xmath35 ) states , `` @xmath0-like '' orbitals at a certain site can hybridize with `` @xmath5-like '' orbitals at a neighboring site as a result of the tilt and rotation of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "this leads to bands with mixed @xmath55/@xmath5 character ( note the bands around the gap with strong pdos components of both @xmath55 and @xmath5 character ) . due to this strong mixing it",
    "is not possible to construct 8 @xmath55 character mlwfs within one energy window used in the disentanglement procedure .",
    "the corresponding energy window would inevitably also contain the local minority spin `` @xmath5 '' bands . since due to the gfo distortion",
    "these bands can hybridize with the minority spin `` @xmath0 '' bands , this would lead to mlwfs with strongly mixed @xmath0/@xmath5 character . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we therefore construct two separate sets of 4 local majority and 4 local minority spin mlwfs using two different energy windows  @xcite .",
    "these energy windows have to be chosen carefully for each individual method .",

    "it can be seen from ( and perhaps more clearly from ) , that both the lower and the upper bound fall within small gaps separating the bands within the energy window from other bands at lower and higher energies .",
    "furthermore , for pbe+u and hse the mlwfs can be constructed from a completely isolated set of bands , whereas in the case of pbe and gw@xmath29 additional bands with predominant minority spin mn(@xmath5 ) character are included in the energy window .",

    "we note that , as discussed in @xcite , the hubbard correction within pbe+@xmath2 is applied to rather localized atomic - like orbitals , whereas the parameter @xmath135 corresponds to more extended @xmath0-like wannier orbitals .",
    "the jt splitting is strongly affected by hybridization with the surrounding oxygen ligands and is thus quite different for atomic - like and extended wannier states @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath196 is quite different from the @xmath2 value used within pbe+@xmath2 , and the smaller value of @xmath196 can thus be related to the fact that the electron - electron interaction is more screened in the more extended effective @xmath0 wannier orbitals . on the other hand , the similarity between @xmath193 and the @xmath2 value used within pbe+@xmath2 indicates that the local spin - splitting is more or less the same for both sets of orbitals , which is consistent with the view that this splitting is essentially an atomic property . a similar difference between @xmath193 and @xmath196",
    "is also observed for hse and gw@xmath29 .",
    "the large values of @xmath135 delivered by hse reflects the larger spin splitting and band gap in the corresponding band structure compared to pbe+@xmath2 and gw@xmath29 .    the large difference between the two parameters @xmath193 and",
    "@xmath196 also indicates that it is not possible to map the electron - electron interaction effects manifested in the on - site matrix corresponding to effective @xmath0 orbitals to only one interaction parameter while using pbe as `` noninteracting '' reference .",
    "similar conclusions have already been reached in @xcite for the pbe+@xmath2 case . from the current study",
    "we can conclude that the modification of the local spin splitting ( described by @xmath193 ) and the enhancement of the jt induced orbital splitting ( described by @xmath196 ) that arise in the kohn - sham or gw@xmath29 quasiparticle band structures due to the beyond - pbe treatment of exchange and correlation , are not compatible with a simple mean - field hubbard - like correction to an otherwise `` non - interacting '' tb hamiltonian with two effective @xmath0 orbitals per mn site and only one parameter describing the electron - electron interaction .",
    "this leads to an important conclusion of the present study with regard to methods such as lda+@xmath2 or lda+dmft , which supplement a `` non - interacting '' kohn - sham hamiltonian with a hubbard interaction between a strongly interacting subset of orbitals : using different methods for obtaining the noninteracting reference can lead to significant differences , and it is by no means clear whether pbe ( gga ) or even lda always provides the best starting point for a more sophisticated treatment of correlation effects .",
    "our results also emphasize the importance of finding improved ways to account for the double counting correction when using different electronic structures as noninteracting reference .    in order to see how , within the limitations discussed in the preceeding paragraph , a tb hamiltonian of the form - can reproduce the mlwf band dispersion",
    ", we consider a modified parameterization using @xmath196 to model the el - el interactions .",
    "since in that way the correlation - induced increase of the spin splitting is only partially covered by the el - el term , we correct this by introducing an `` empirical '' correction to the hund s rule coupling : @xmath205 note , that analogously we could choose @xmath193 as the el - el interaction parameter and define an appropriate correction to @xmath187 .",
    "however , since the fundamental band gap in lamno@xmath1 is largely controlled by the jt induced splitting between occupied and unoccupied @xmath0 bands , and since in a tb model for lamno@xmath206 it seems most desirable to describe the band gap correctly , we choose @xmath196 to model the el - el interactions .",
    "if the correction @xmath204 is neglected , the local majority spin bands around the band gap are still described quite well , even though the splitting with respect to the local minority spin bands will be underestimated , which might be acceptable for certain applications .",
    "also shows the dispersion calculated from such a modified tb model with explicit el - el interaction , where the correlation induced change of the spin splitting and band gap is described by two interaction parameters , @xmath196 and @xmath204 , while @xmath128 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath174 are fixed at their respective pbe values .",
    "in addition , the hopping amplitudes are set to the values given in .",
    "the band dispersions using these sets of parameters ( shown as green crosses in ) again almost perfectly follow the mlwf bands .",
    "the agreement between the bands calculated within the two parameterizations ( model 1 and 2 ) also reflects the transferability of the on - site parameters between the structures with and without the gfo distortion .",
    "in this paper we have presented a general scheme to parameterize , within a tb picture , the band structure of the prototypical jt distorted @xmath0 perovskite lamno@xmath1 by means of a suitable downfolding of the _ ab initio _ electron dispersion relations onto a small set of mlwfs .",
    "the tabulated tb parameters should provide an interpretative direction for more sophisticated many - body model hamiltonian investigations of similar systems  @xcite .    by comparing the pbe and beyond - pbe findings we can draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "_ ab initio _ electronic structure results .",
    "we find that all methods consistently find a mott - hubbard insulating state .",
    "gw@xmath29 provides the best agreement with experiments in terms of bandgap value , and both gw@xmath29 and hse convey a satisfactory description of valence and conduction band spectra . while in the pbe+@xmath2 and hse cases a suitable adjustment of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath80 can selectively improve the performance with respect to either bandgap or magnetic exchange interactions , a universal value that provides all quantities with good accuracy can not be found . even though the standard value @xmath207 in hse seems to provide rather accurate magnetic coupling constants ,",
    "clearly a smaller @xmath80 is necessary to obtain a better mott - hubbard gap .",
    "while the two different codes used in the present study lead only to marginal differences in the kohn - sham band structure and the corresponding tb parameterization , the relative energies of different magnetic configurations depend on subtle details of the used methods , which hampers a concise comparison between the different energy functional ( it should be noted however , that the paw approach is usually considered superior to pure pseudopotential schemes ) . within vasp a value for the hubbard @xmath2 between 2 - 3",
    "ev leads to similar magnetic coupling along @xmath83 as hse , but somewhat stronger fm coupling within the @xmath81 planes . despite all its well - known limitations",
    "when applied to strongly - correlated materials , pbe does not seem to perform too badly ( of course the fact the we have used the experimental structure helps in that respect , since pbe is known to fail in properly reproducing the jt distortion in lamno@xmath1  @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   mlwfs . despite the difficulties to fully disentangle the effective @xmath0 bands from other bands with similar energies , which are most pronounced within pbe+@xmath2 and hse , the resulting mlwfs and associated ordering ( fig.[fig : oo ] ) look rather similar and are in good agreement with the precedent plots of yin@xcite .",
    "this represents a further proof of the quality and reliability of the wannier construction of the @xmath0 @xmath208 and @xmath209 orbitals . despite these similarities , the differences in the underlying band structures lead to distinct differences in the hamilt nian matri xelements in reciprocal space , and allow for an accurate quantitative analysis of the differences between the various approximations for the exchange - correlation kernel .",
    "3 .   tb parameterization .",
    "we have demonstrated that the methods - derived changes in the tb parameters due to the different treatment of the el - el exchange - correlation kernel in conventional and beyond - pbe approaches can be accounted for using two different routes : ( a ) model 1 ( @xmath210 ) . in this model",
    "the tb hamiltonian does not explicitly incorporate an el - el interaction term .",
    "all changes in the beyond - pbe band structure with respect to the `` noninteracting '' pbe bands are integrated in the hopping , jt and hund parameters ( in particular @xmath154 , @xmath175 , and @xmath128 ) .",
    "( b ) model 2 ( @xmath211 ) . in this second type of parameterization we have build in an el - el term in the tb hamiltonian explicitly .",
    "the el - el interaction effects are treated by parameterizing the on site hund and jt parameters into a noninteracting ( pbe ) and interacting ( dependent on @xmath196 and @xmath193 ) part . since we found that @xmath196 @xmath212 @xmath193 , in order to achieve a correct parameterization it is necessary to fix one @xmath135 channel ( @xmath196 ) and evaluate the changes on the remaining one ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "both , model 1 and 2 , yield excellent tb bands , essentially overlapping with the underlying mlwfs ones .",
    "+ we note that the different levels of approximation for the non - interacting band structure can lead to significant changes in the hopping amplitudes , which can not easily be accounted for by a local double - counting correction .",
    "in addition , we have also shown that the influence of the beyond - pbe treatment on the model parameters of the local hamiltonian can not be captured by a simple mean - field hubbard term with only one interaction parameter .",
    "for an accurate many - body or effective model treatment of lamno@xmath1 and similar materials it thus seems most desirable to start from the most realistic single particle band - structure ( i.e. not necessarily lda or gga ) and use an appropriate double counting correction .",
    "the exact form of such a correction term , however , is still unclear at this point .",
    "a possible alternative solution to correctly treat correlation effects without being contaminated by the double - counting problem is the gw+dmft scheme , which has recently attracted several research groups and will be most likely available in the next future@xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that mlwfs can be constructed efficiently not only at conventional dft level ( pbe ) , but also from hybrid functional ( hse ) and quasiparticle ( gw@xmath29 ) wavefunctions , through the creation of an appropriate interface between the electronic structure code vasp  @xcite and the publicly available wannier90 code  @xcite .",
    "thereby , we have used the well - established pw2wannier90 interface as benchmark at the pbe and pbe+@xmath2 level  @xcite .",
    "given the booming application of hybrid dft and gw@xmath29 calculations for a wide variety of materials for which the possibility to describe the relevant physics using a minimal basis set is important ( these include , e. g. , fe - based superconductors  @xcite , cuprates  @xcite and multiferroics  @xcite ) , the vasp2wannier90 interface which allows to construct mlwfs directly from the widely - used vasp code , will provide a valuable tool for future research . from the practical point of view , we have demonstrated that mlwfs can be efficiently used to accurately interpolate the hse and gw@xmath29 band structure from the coarse uniform k - points mesh to the desirable ( and dense ) symmetry lines , thereby remedying the fundamental practical limitation of hse and gw@xmath29 scheme in computing energy eigenvalues for selected k - points@xcite .",
    "we expect that our study will serve as a reference for future studies involving mlwfs - based downfolding procedure .",
    "the authors would like to thank silvia picozzi and alessandro stroppa ( cnr - spin , laquila ) for initiating the implementation of the vasp2wannier90 interface and for hosting martijn marsman in laquila where large parts of this interface were written .",

    "we express the hopping amplitudes @xmath125 as @xmath214 matrices with respect to the orbital indices : @xmath215 .",
    "there are 4 different hoppings parameters which we consider here , the spin - dependent nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath149 , the second - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath150 and the second - nearest neighbor hopping along the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 axes @xmath151 .",
