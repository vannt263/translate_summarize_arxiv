    "since its very origins , the statistical mechanics of two dimensionnal critical systems has seen a deep interplay between physics and mathematics .",
    "this was already true for onsager s solution of the 2d ising model and the computation of the magnetization by yang @xcite .",
    "in the 80 s , the link between physics and mathematics was mainly through representation theory , affine lie algebras and the virasoro algebra playing the most central roles .",
    "two dimensional conformal field theories @xcite have led to an enormous amount of exact results , including the computation of multipoint correlators and partial classifications .",
    "the study of multifractal properties of conformally invariant critical clusters has been less systematic , but has nevertheless produced a number of remarquable successes ( see eg .",
    "refs.@xcite and references therein ) , the famous cardy formula giving the probability for the existence of a connected cluster percolating between two opposite sides of a rectangle in two dimensional critical percolation @xcite being one of the highlights .",
    "more recently , probability theory , stochastic processes to be precise , have started to play an important role , due to a beautiful connection between brownian motion and critical clusters discovered by schramm @xcite .",
    "this connection is via the loewner evolution equation , which describes locally growing domains @xmath0 ( called hulls ) in the upper half plane implicitly by prescribing the variation of the normalized uniformizing map for the complement . in this way ,",
    "the growth of the hull is coded in a real continuous function . taking this function to be a brownian sample path leads to stochastic ( chordal ) loewner evolutions ( sle ) of growing hulls whose properties are those expected for conformally invariant critical clusters .",
    "there is a single parameter , denoted @xmath1 , which is the time scale for the brownian motion .",
    "this has led to important probabilistic theorems , among which brownian intersection exponents @xcite .",
    "moreover , this framework made it possible to prove in certain cases that lattice statistical models have a conformally invariant critical behavior .",
    "for instance , cardy s formula is now a theorem @xcite .",
    "the link between sle and standard conformal field theory ( cft ) was obscure for several years , but recently we proposed a direct connection @xcite .",
    "the idea is to couple cft to sle via boundary conditions , namely to look at a cft in the random geometry of the complement of the hull in the upper half plane .",
    "the crucial observation is that if one inserts at the origin ( where the hull starts to grow ) a primary boundary operator ( leading to a boundary state @xmath2 ) of appropriate weight in a cft of appropriate central charge , and then lets the hull grow , the corresponding conformal state is a local martingale in the sense of probability theory , i.e a quantity whose probabilistic average is time independant . in this way",
    ", many quantities computed by probabilistic methods can be shown to be directly related to correlation functions of cft @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "the first is sle independent .",
    "we give a rigorous construction of the cft operator implementing finite local conformal transformations fixing a point .",
    "this amounts to show how to go from certain subalgebras of the virasoro algebra to a corresponding lie group via exponentiation .    as a first application",
    ", we use coordinates on these groups to build coherent state highest weight representations of the virasoro algebra .",
    "we observe a striking similarity with the representations of the virasoro algebra that appear in matrix models @xcite .",
    "this is a pedestrian implementation of the geometric ideas _",
    " la borel - weil _ presented in @xcite .    under some global conditions",
    ", one can multiply operators corresponding to local conformal transformations fixing different points , leading to an embryonic version of the virasoro group ( which is ill defined in the cft context  : the central extension of the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle is not what is needed ) . as a byproduct",
    ", we give a theorem which does for the virasoro algebra what wick s theorem does for oscillator algebras .",
    "this kind of computation could have been made right at the beginning of cft , in the 80 s .",
    "it seems that certain analogous formul  were derived at that time @xcite , but we have not been able to trace those back in the published litterature .",
    "these purely algebraic considerations have applications to sle .",
    "the uniformization of the growing hull @xmath0 is given , close to the point at infinity , by a suitably normalized local conformal transformation @xmath3 .",
    "this leads immediately to a clean definition of the conformal state @xmath4 describing the growing hull @xmath0 .",
    "the invertible operator @xmath5 is then shown to satisfy a stochastic differential equation .",
    "we had to leave aside analytical questions of existence of solutions , relying on physical intuition . ] which implies that @xmath4 is a local martingale .",
    "we give a brief account of the proof , using the above mentioned coherent state representations of the virasoro algebra , that @xmath4 is the generating function of all sle martingales in a precise algebraic sense and that these martingales build a certain highest weight representation of the virasoro algebra with a non trivial character .",
    "this is an elaboration of @xcite .",
    "finally , we turn to the partition function martingale .",
    "if a cft is coupled via boundary conditions not only to the growing hull @xmath0 but also to a fixed ( deterministic ) hull @xmath6 disjoint from @xmath0 , the cft partition function contains a universal contribution corresponding to some kind of interaction between @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "this is by definition a local martingale .",
    "we use wick s theorem for the virasoro algebra to give yet another illustration that the sle quantities computed by probabilists @xcite are in fact deeply rooted in cft . for @xmath7 ,",
    "this martingale computes the probability that @xmath0 never touches @xmath6 .",
    "the previous paragraph is definitely not a claim that mathematicians have rediscovered things that were known to theoretical physicists .",
    "quite the opposite is true : the discoveries of probabilists have motivated us to go back to the foundations of cft to realize that maybe certain basic construction had not been given enough attention and that some cft jewels had been left dormant .",
    "* acknowledgements : * we take this opportunity to warmly thank wendelin werner for many illuminating explanations on the probabilistic and geometric intuition motivating sle constructions and misha gromov for his questions on finite conformal transformations in conformal field theory .",
    "work supported in part by ec contract number hprn - ct-2002 - 00325 of the euclid research training network .",
    "the aim of this section is to recall basic properties of stochastic loewner evolutions ( sle ) and its generalizations that we shall need in the following .",
    "most results that we recall can be found in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a nice introduction to sle for physicists and @xcite for pedagogical summer school notes .",
    "a hull in the upper half plane @xmath8 is a bounded simply connected subset @xmath9 ( for the usual topology of @xmath10 ) such that @xmath11 is open , connected and simply connected .",
    "the local growth of a family of hulls @xmath0 parametrized by @xmath12 with @xmath13 is related to complex analysis in the following way .",
    "the complement of @xmath0 in @xmath14 is a domain @xmath15 which is simply connected by hypothesis , so that by the riemann mapping theorem @xmath15 is conformally equivalent to @xmath14 via a map @xmath16 .",
    "this map can be normalized to behave as @xmath17 : the @xmath18 automorphism group of @xmath14 allows to impose @xmath19 for large @xmath20 , and then the coefficient of @xmath21 is fixed to be @xmath22 by a time reparametrization",
    ". the crucial condition of _ local _ growth leads to the loewner differential equation @xmath23 with @xmath24 a real function . for fixed @xmath20 , @xmath25 is well - defined up to the time @xmath26 for which @xmath27 . then @xmath28 .",
    "( chordal ) stochastic loewner evolutions is obtained @xcite by choosing @xmath29 with @xmath30 a normalized brownian motion and @xmath1 a real positive parameter so that @xmath31=\\kappa\\,{\\rm min}(t , s)$ ] .",
    "here and in the following , @xmath32 $ ] denotes expectation value .",
    "the next section , which also contains basic definitions to which the reader can refer , is devoted to a careful discussion of the implementation of finite local conformal transformations in conformal field theory . in this section",
    ", we simply assume that such an implementation is possible , and we derive a direct connection between sle and cft .",
    "sle is defined via an ordinary differential equation , but for our reinterpretation in terms of conformal field theories , it is useful to define @xmath33 which satisfies the stochastic differential equation @xmath34    we observe that the conditions at spatial infinity satisfied by @xmath3 imply that its germ there , which determines it uniquely , belongs to the group @xmath35 of germs of holomorphic functions at @xmath36 of the form @xmath37 , the group law being composition . in this way , the loewner equations describe trajectories on @xmath35 in a time dependent left - invariant vector field , whose value at the identity element is @xmath38 .    due to the fact that @xmath24 is almost surely nowhere differentiable ,",
    "this observation has to be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "we let @xmath39 act on @xmath40 , the space of germs of holomorphic functions at infinity , by composition , @xmath41 .",
    "observe that @xmath42 so this is an anti representation .",

    "however , as we shall see in the next section , highest weight representations of @xmath47 can be extended in such a way as to become representations of @xmath35 .",
    "we take this for granted for the moment and associate to @xmath50 an operator @xmath51 acting on appropriate representations and satisfying @xmath52 and @xmath53    the basic observation is the following @xcite :    let @xmath2 be the highest weight vector in the irreducible highest weight representation of @xmath47 of central charge @xmath54 and conformal weight @xmath55 . then @xmath56 $ ] is time independent .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that for this special choice of central charge and weight , the irreducible highest weight representation is degenerate at level 2 and @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58 from the definition of ito integrals , @xmath59 and @xmath5 are independent , so that @xmath60=0 $ ] as announced",
    ".    this result can be interpreted as follows .",
    "take a conformal field theory in @xmath15 .",
    "the correlation functions in this geometry can be computed by looking at the same theory in @xmath14 modulo the insertion of an operator representing the deformation from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "this operator is @xmath5 .",
    "suppose that the central charge is @xmath61 and the boundary conditions are such that there is a boundary changing primary operator of weight @xmath62 inserted at the tip of @xmath3 ( the existence of this tip is more or less a consequence of the local growth condition ) .",
    "then in average the correlation functions of the conformal field theory in the fluctuating geometry @xmath15 are time independent and equal to their value at @xmath63 .",
    "we call @xmath4 a generating function for conserved quantities because for any time - independent bra @xmath64 , the scalar @xmath65 $ ] is a time independent scalar .",
    "we shall see later that in an algebraic sense , all conserved quantities for chordal sle are of this form .",
    "a word of caution is needed here . before talking about",
    "@xmath65 $ ] , we should in principle show that @xmath66 is an integrable random variable .",
    "this is true for instance if @xmath64 is a finite excitation of @xmath67 , but this condition is far too restrictive for probability theory and for conformal field theory as well .    in probabilistic terms , a random variable",
    "whose ito derivative contains only a @xmath59 contribution ( no @xmath68 ) is called a local martingale .",
    "we shall often drop the term local , even if the notion of martingale , though closely related to the notion of local martingale , is more restrictive . in particular ,",
    "the time independence of expectations is always true for martingales .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the mathematical literature @xcite .",
    "a ( rather provocative ) definition of ( boundary ) conformal field theory is that it is the representation theory of the virasoro algebra @xmath47 .",
    "the virasoro algebra has an subalgebra @xmath69 , with generators the @xmath46 s @xmath70 , which is closely related to @xmath35 , the group of germs of conformal transformations that fix @xmath36 .",
    "this is crucial for the construction of @xmath5 .",
    "our goal in this section is to show that indeed , @xmath35 acts on sufficiently many physically relevant representations of @xmath47 to be able to make sense of conformal field theories in the fluctuating geometry @xmath15 .    in the same spirit , the group @xmath71 germs of conformal transformations that fix @xmath72 is closely related to the subalgebra @xmath73 of @xmath47 with generators the @xmath46 s @xmath74 .",
    "this group will also play an important role in the forthcoming discussion .",
    "the theories we shall study will mostly be boundary conformal field theories , and will shall talk of field or operator without making always explicit whether the argument is in the bulk or on the boundary .",
    "the basic principles of conformal field theory state that the fields can be classified according to their behavior under ( local ) conformal transformations",
    ". then the correlation functions in a region @xmath75 are known once they are known in a region @xmath76 and an explicit conformal map @xmath77 from @xmath75 to @xmath76 preserving boundary conditions is given .",
    "primary fields have a very simple behavior under conformal transformations : for a bulk primary field @xmath78 of weight @xmath79 , @xmath80 is invariant , and for a boundary conformal field @xmath81 of weight @xmath82 , @xmath83 is invariant .",
    "so the statistical averages in @xmath75 and @xmath76 are related by @xmath84    such a behavior is described as local conformal covariance .    in a local theory ,",
    "small deformations are generated by the insertion of a local operator , the stress tensor .",
    "local conformal covariance can then be rephrased : the stress tensor of a conformal field theory is not only conserved and symmetric , but also traceless , so that it has only two independent components , one of which , @xmath85 , is holomorphic ( except for singularities when the argument of @xmath85 approaches the argument of other insertions ) , and the other one , @xmath86 , is antiholomorphic ( again except for short distance singularities ) .",
    "the field @xmath85 itself is not a primary field in general , but a projective connection  : @xmath87 in this formula , @xmath88 is the central charge and @xmath89 is the schwartzian derivative of @xmath77 at @xmath20 .    if @xmath75 is a non empty simply connected region strictly contained in @xmath10 , the riemann mapping theorem states that @xmath76 can be chosen to be unit disk @xmath90 or equivalently the upper - half plane @xmath91 with a point a infinity added , which belongs to the boundary .",
    "this second choice will prove most convenient for us in the sequel .",
    "in boundary conformal field theory , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are not independent : they are related by analytic continuation .",
    "the relationship is expressed most simply in the upper - half plane .",
    "the vectors fields @xmath92 and @xmath93 are generators of infinitesimal conformal transformations in @xmath10 but only the combination @xmath94 preserves the boundary of @xmath91 , that is , the real axis .",
    "write @xmath95 and for a while write @xmath96 for what we usually write @xmath97 .",
    "choosing boundary conditions such that there is no flow of energy momentum across the boundary @xmath98 , @xmath96 is real along the real axis , and by the schwartz reflection principle has an analytic extension to the lower half plane as @xmath99 . due to this property",
    ", most contour integrals involving @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the upper half plane can be seen as contour integrals involving only @xmath85 but in the full complex plane .",
    "using conformal field theory in @xmath91 to express correlators in any simply connected region strictly contained in @xmath10 has another advantage : one can use the formalism of radial quantization in a straightforward way .",
    "the statistical averages are replaced by quantum expectation values : @xmath100 in this formula , @xmath101 is the vacuum and @xmath102 denotes radial ordering : the fields are ordered from left to right from the farthest to the closest to the origin .",
    "the integral @xmath103 along any contour of index @xmath104 with respect to @xmath72 , defines an operator @xmath46 ( note again that from the point of view of contour integrals in the upper half plane , @xmath46 involves @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) .",

    "except for the anomalous @xmath88-term , the commutation relations of the @xmath46 s are those of the @xmath106 s .",
    "let us take this opportunity to recall that to preserve classical symmetries in quantum mechanics , the crucial point is to have the symmetries act well on operators , i.e. that the adjoint action represents the classical symmetries .",
    "this is because the phase of states are not observables .",
    "hence symmetries in quantum mechanics act projectively , and this leaves room for central terms such as @xmath88 in @xmath47 .",
    "the advantage of the operatorial version of conformal field theory is that one can use the powerful methods of representation theory , applied to the virasoro algebra .      in the sequel",

    "we apply the results of section [ sec : wick ] to the case when @xmath379 is the growing hull @xmath557 and @xmath6 is another disjoint hull . from the previous computation we know that @xmath558 is a local martingale .",
    "we start from @xmath392 and @xmath16 to build a commutative diagram as before , with maps denoted by @xmath559 and @xmath560 uniformizing respectively @xmath561 and @xmath562 , and satisfying @xmath563 .",
    "now @xmath564    from eq.([eq : trans ] ) we know that the operator @xmath565 corresponds to the map @xmath566 , so that @xmath567    from the loewner equation @xmath568 and @xmath569 finally @xmath570 were @xmath571 uniformizes the two hull geometry corresponding to @xmath572 and @xmath573 is normalized to ensure the commutativity of the uniformization diagram as explained before .",

    "the behaviour of the other factor in the martingale , @xmath587 , is much harder to control , so we now restrict to @xmath7 , which is the same as @xmath588 because @xmath589 .",
    "so the partition function martingale @xmath590 , at @xmath591 is @xmath72 if @xmath6 is hit before @xmath578 and close to @xmath104 if the opposite is true .",
