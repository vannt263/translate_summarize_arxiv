    "a variety of systems of interacting elements can be represented as networks .",
    "a network is a collection of nodes and links ; a link connects a pair of nodes . generally speaking",
    ", some nodes play central functions , such as binding different parts of the network together and controlling dynamics in the network . to identify important nodes in a network , various centrality measures based on different criteria",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "links of many real networks such as the world wide web ( www ) , food webs , neural networks , protein interaction networks , and many social networks are directed or asymmetrically weighted .",
    "in contrast to the case of undirected networks , a link in directed networks indicates an asymmetrical relationship between two nodes , for example , the control of the source node of a link over the target node .",
    "the direction of a link indicates the relative importance of the two nodes .",
    "central nodes in a network in this sense would be , for example , executive personnels in an organizational network and top predators in a food web .",
    "generally , more ( less ) central nodes are located at an upper level ( a lower level ) in the hierarchy of the network , where hierarchy refers to the distinction between upper and lower levels in terms of the centrality value as relevant in , for example , biological @xcite and social @xcite systems .",
    "this type of centrality measure is necessarily specialized for directed networks and includes the popularity or prestige measures for social networks @xcite , ranking systems for webpages such as the pagerank @xcite and hits @xcite , adaptations of the pagerank to citation networks of academic papers @xcite and journals @xcite , and ranking systems of sports teams @xcite .",
    "we call them ranking - type centrality measures .    under practical restrictions such as overwhelming network size or incomplete information about the network , it is often difficult to exactly obtain ranking - type centrality values of nodes . in such situations ,",
    "the simplest approximators are perhaps those based on the degree of nodes ( _ i.e. _ , the number of links owned by a node ) .",
    "for example , the indegree of a node can be an accurate approximator of the pagerank of websites @xcite and ranks of academic journals @xcite .",
    "however , such local approximations often fail @xcite , implying a significant effect of the global structure of networks . a ubiquitous global structure of networks that adversely affects local approximations is the modular structure . both in undirected @xcite and directed @xcite networks , nodes are often classified into modules ( also called communities ) such that the nodes are densely connected within a module and sparsely connected across different modules . in modular networks",
    ", some modules may be central in a coarse - grained network , where each module is regarded as a supernode @xcite .",
    "however , relationships between the centrality of individual nodes and that of modules are not well understood . using these relationships",
    ", we will be able to assess centralities of individual nodes only on the basis of coarse - grained information about the organization of modules or under limited computational resources .    in this study",
    ", we analyze the ranking - type centrality measures for directed modular networks .",
    "we are concerned with the modular structure of the network in the meaning of partitioning of the network into parts , and not the overlapping community structure @xcite .",
    "we determine the centrality of modules , which reflects the hierarchical structure of the networks in the sense of subordination @xcite , not nestedness @xcite .",
    "then , we show that module membership is a chief determinant of the centrality of individual nodes .",
    "a node tends to be central when it belongs to a high - rank module and it is locally central by , for example , having a large degree . to clarify these points ,",
    "we analytically evaluate centrality in modular networks . on the basis of the matrix tree theorem ,",
    "the centrality value of a node is derived from the number of spanning trees rooted at the node .",
    "we use this relationship to develop an approximation scheme for the ranking - type centrality values of nodes in modular networks .",
    "the approximated value turns out to be a combination of local and global effects , _",
    "i.e. _ , the degree of nodes and the centrality of modules . for analytical tractability",
    ", we formulate our theory using the ranking - type centrality measure called the influence , but the results are also applicable to the pagerank . we corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme using the _ caenorhabditis elegans _ neural network , an email social network , and the www .",
    "we consider a directed and weighted network of @xmath0 nodes denoted by @xmath1 . a set of nodes",
    "is denoted by @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is a set of directed links , _",
    "i.e. _ , node @xmath4 sends a directed link to node @xmath5 with weight @xmath6 if and only if @xmath7 . the weight represents the amplitude of the direct influence of node @xmath4 on node @xmath5 .",
    "we set @xmath8 when @xmath9 .",
    "depending on applications , different centrality measures can be used to rank the nodes in a network .",
    "we analyze the effect of the modular structure on ranking of nodes using a centrality measure called _ influence _ because it facilitates theoretical analysis . the existence of a one - to - one mapping from the influence to the pagerank @xcite and to variations of the pagerank used for ranking academic journals and articles @xcite , which we will explain in this section , enables us to adapt our results to the case of such ranking - type centrality measures . to show that our results are not specific to the proposed measure , we study the influence and the pagerank simultaneously .",
    "we define the influence of node @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath10 , by the solution of the following set of @xmath0 linear equations : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the indegree of node @xmath4 , and @xmath13 provides the normalization .",
    "@xmath10 is large if ( i ) node @xmath4 directly affects many nodes ( _ i.e. _ , many terms probably with a large @xmath6 on the rhs of eq .  ) , ( ii ) the nodes that receive directed links from node @xmath4 are influential ( _ i.e. _ , large @xmath14 on the rhs ) , and ( iii ) node @xmath4 has a small indegree .",
    "equation   is the definition for strongly connected networks ; @xmath15 is defined to be strongly connected if there is a path , _",
    "i.e. _ , a sequence of directed links , from any node @xmath4 to any node @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath15 is not strongly connected , there is no path from a certain node @xmath4 to a certain node @xmath5 .",
    "then , node @xmath4 can not influence node @xmath5 even indirectly , and the problem of determining the influence of nodes is decomposed into that for each strongly connected component .",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath15 is strongly connected .",
    "the influence @xmath10 represents the importance of nodes in different types of dynamics on networks ( see appendix  a for details ) .",
    "firstly , @xmath10 is equal to the fixation probability of a new opinion introduced at node @xmath4 in a voter - type interacting particle system @xcite .",
    "secondly , if all links are reversed such that a random walker visits influential nodes with high probabilities , @xmath10 is the stationary density of the continuous - time simple random walk .",
    "thirdly , @xmath10 is the so - called reproductive value used in population ecology @xcite .",
    "fourthly , @xmath10 is the contribution of an opinion at node @xmath4 to the opinion of the entire population in the consensus in the continuous - time version of the degroot model @xcite .",
    "fifthly , @xmath10 is equal to the amplitude of the collective response in the synchronized dynamics when an input is given to node @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the influence can be mapped to the pagerank .",
    "the pagerank , denoted by @xmath16 for node @xmath4 , is defined self - consistently by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the outdegree of node @xmath4 , @xmath19 if @xmath20 , and @xmath21 if @xmath22 . the second term on the rhs of eq .",
    "is present only when @xmath23 .",
    "note that the direction of the link in the pagerank has the meaning opposite to that in the influence ; @xmath16 of a webpage is incremented by an incoming link ( hyperlink ) , whereas @xmath10 is incremented by an outgoing link .",
    "the introduction of @xmath24 homogenizes @xmath16 and is necessary for the pagerank to be defined for directed networks that are not strongly connected , such as real web graphs .",
    "the normalization is given by @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath16 is regarded as the stationary density of the discrete - time simple random walk on the network @xcite , where @xmath26 is the probability of a jump to a randomly selected node .",
    "an essential difference between the two measures lies in normalization . in the influence , the total credit that node @xmath5 gives its neighbors is equal to @xmath27 , while that in the pagerank is equal to @xmath28 . in the pagerank , the multiplicative factor of the total credit that node @xmath5 gives other nodes",
    "is set to @xmath29 to prevent nodes with many outgoing links from biasing ranks of nodes . in the ranking of webpages ,",
    "creation of a webpage @xmath4 with many hyperlinks does not indicate that node @xmath4 gives a large amount of credit to recipients of a link .",
    "each neighbor of node @xmath4 receives the credit @xmath30 from node @xmath4 .",
    "we should refer to the pagerank when nodes can select the number of recipients of credit ( _ e.g. _ , the www and citation - based ranking of academic papers and journals ) .",
    "we should use the influence when the importance of all links is proportional to their weights ( _ e.g. _ , opinion formation and synchronization mentioned above ) .",
    "the pagerank is equal to the influence in a network modified from the original network @xmath15 ( see appendix  b for derivation ) . in particular ,",
    "the pagerank in @xmath15 for @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the influence of node @xmath4 for the network @xmath34 , which is obtained by reversing all links of @xmath15 .",
    "we use this relation to extend our results derived for the influence to the case of the pagerank .",
    "the influence has a nontrivial sense only in directed networks because @xmath35 in eq",
    ".   leads to @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , any network with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) results in @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , from eq .  , @xmath39 for such a network , where @xmath40 is the mean degree .",
    "in this case , @xmath10 and @xmath16 are not affected by the global structure of the network .    in directed or asymmetrically weighted networks , @xmath10 and @xmath16 are heterogeneous in general .",
    "the mean - field approximation ( ma ) is the simplest ansatz based on the local property of a node . by using @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 .",
    "combination of this and eqs .",
    "yields the ma for the pagerank : @xmath44 .",
    "we can calculate @xmath10 by enumerating spanning trees . to show this , note that eq .",
    "implies that @xmath10 is the left eigenvector with eigenvalue zero of the laplacian matrix defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath22 ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath47 the @xmath48 cofactor of @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an @xmath52 matrix obtained by deleting the @xmath4-th row and the @xmath5-th column of @xmath49 . because @xmath53 , ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath5 . using eq .   and the fact that @xmath49 is degenerate , we obtain @xmath55 therefore , @xmath56 is the left eigenvector of @xmath49 with eigenvalue zero , which yields @xmath57 from the matrix tree theorem @xcite , @xmath58 is equal to the sum of the weight of all possible directed spanning trees rooted at node @xmath4 .",
    "the weight of a spanning tree is equal to the product of the weight of @xmath59 links forming the spanning tree .",
    "most directed networks in the real world are more structured than those captured by the ma .",
    "a ubiquitous global structure of networks is modular structure .",
    "modular networks consist of several densely connected subgraphs called modules ( also called communities ) , and modules are connected to each other by relatively few links . as an example , a subnetwork of the _ c.  elegans _ neural network @xcite containing 4 modules is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem modular](a ) .",
    "modular structure is common in both undirected @xcite and directed @xcite networks",
    ".    modular structure of directed networks often leads to hierarchical structure . by hierarchy",
    ", we refer to the situation in which modules are located at different levels in terms of the value of the ranking - type centrality .",
    "it is relatively easy to traverse from a node in an upper level to one in a lower level along directed links , but not vice versa .",
    "the hierarchical structure leads to the deviation of @xmath10 from the value obtained from the ma .    as an example , consider the directed @xmath60-partite network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example hie ] . layer @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) contains @xmath63 nodes , where @xmath0 is divided by @xmath60 .",
    "the nodes in the same layer are connected bidirectionally with weight @xmath64 .",
    "each node in layer @xmath61 ( @xmath65 ) sends directed links to all nodes in layer @xmath66 with weight unity , and each node in layer @xmath61 ( @xmath67 ) sends directed links to all the @xmath63 nodes in layer @xmath68 with weight @xmath69 .",
    "the following results do not change if two adjacent layers are connected via just an asymmetrically weighted bridge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem modular](b ) . because of the symmetry , all nodes in layer @xmath61 have the same influence @xmath70 . from eq .  , we obtain @xmath71 when @xmath72 , a node in a layer with small @xmath61 is more influential than a node in layer with large @xmath61 . the ma yields @xmath73 the actual @xmath70 decreases exponentially throughout the hierarchy , whereas @xmath74 does not .",
    "we observe a similar discrepancy in the case of the pagerank .",
    "we develop an improved approximation for the influence in modular networks by combining the ma and the correction factor obtained from the global modular structure of networks .",
    "consider a network of @xmath75 modules @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "for mathematical tractability , we assume that each module communicates with the other modules via a single portal node @xmath78 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem modular](b ) ; the network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem modular](b ) is an approximation of that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem modular](a ) .",
    "we denote the weight of the link @xmath79 by @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath10 in this modular network by enumerating spanning trees rooted at node @xmath82 .",
    "denote such a spanning tree by @xmath83 .",
    "the intersection of @xmath83 and @xmath76 is a spanning tree restricted to @xmath76 and rooted at node @xmath4 .",
    "this restricted spanning tree reaches all nodes in @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath83 enters @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) via a directed path from node @xmath86 to node @xmath87 .",
    "this path is provided by a spanning tree in the network of @xmath75 modules , where each module is represented by a single node .",
    "the other nodes in @xmath84 are spanned by the intersection of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which forms a spanning tree restricted to @xmath84 and rooted at node @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 is a concatenation of ( i ) an intramodular spanning tree in @xmath76 and rooted at node @xmath4 , ( ii ) @xmath88 intramodular spanning trees in @xmath84 and rooted at node @xmath87 ( @xmath85 ) , and ( iii ) a spanning tree in the network of @xmath75 modules rooted at node @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath89 ( @xmath90 for local ) denote the number of spanning trees in @xmath76 with an arbitrary root , and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 for global ) denote the number of spanning trees in a network of @xmath75 modules with an arbitrary root .",

    "two crucial assumptions underlie eq .  .",

    "by solving the set of @xmath75 linear equations , we obtain @xmath95 .",
    "equation   adapted for @xmath116 leads to @xmath117 . by combining this with eq .",
    ", we obtain the ma - mod scheme for the pagerank with @xmath31 : @xmath118 where @xmath119",
    "we examine the effectiveness of the ma - mod scheme using three datasets from different fields .      in the network of nematode _ c.  elegans _ , a pair of neurons may be connected by chemical synapses , which are directed links , or gap junctions , which are undirected links .",
    "we calculate the influence of neurons on the basis of a connectivity dataset @xcite .",
    "the link weight @xmath6 is assumed to be the sum of the number of chemical synapses from neuron @xmath4 to neuron @xmath5 and that of the gap junctions between neuron @xmath4 and neuron @xmath5 .",
    "the following results are qualitatively the same if we ignore the gap junction or the link weight ( see appendix  c for the results ) .",
    "the largest strongly connected component , which we simply call the neural network , contains @xmath120 nodes and @xmath121 links .",
    "it is difficult to determine whether the influence or the pagerank is more appropriate from current biological evidence .",
    "if postsynaptic neurons linearly integrate different synaptic inputs , the influence may be an appropriate measure .",
    "in contrast , postsynaptic neurons may effectively select one synaptic input by a nonlinear mechanism .",
    "if each input is selected with the same probability in a long run and the activity level does not differ much across neurons , the pagerank may be appropriate .",
    "we examine both scenarios using power iteration ( see appendix  d for the methodology ) .    among 274 neurons , 54 , 79 , and 87",

    "<S> many systems , ranging from biological and engineering systems to social systems , can be modeled as directed networks , with links representing directed interaction between two nodes . to assess the importance of a node in a directed network , various centrality measures based on different criteria </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> however , calculating the centrality of a node is often difficult because of the overwhelming size of the network or the incomplete information about the network . </S>",
    "<S> thus , developing an approximation method for estimating centrality measures is needed . in this study , we focus on modular networks ; many real - world networks are composed of modules , where connection is dense within a module and sparse across different modules . </S>",
    "<S> we show that ranking - type centrality measures including the pagerank can be efficiently estimated once the modular structure of a network is extracted . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an analytical method to evaluate the centrality of nodes by combining the local property ( _ i.e. _ , indegree and outdegree of nodes ) and the global property ( _ i.e. _ , centrality of modules ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method is corroborated with real data . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a linkage between the ranking - type centrality values of modules and those of individual nodes . </S>",
    "<S> they also reveal the hierarchical structure of networks in the sense of subordination ( not nestedness ) laid out by connectivity among modules of different relative importance . </S>",
    "<S> the present study raises a novel motive of identifying modules in networks . </S>"
