    "the present bounds on the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the particles generate serious hierarchy problems concerning the amount of cp violation . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the neutron edm @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the qcd vacuum angle ( @xmath1 ) induces a neutron edm which is approximately ten orders of magnitude larger than the existing bound .",
    "this is the source of the so - called strong cp problem , that is , @xmath2 instead of the expected order of unity .",
    "this naturalness problem is nicely solved by the celebrated peccei ",
    "quinn mechanism @xcite which promotes @xmath1 to a dynamical variable via the phases of the quarks @xcite or additional color triplets @xcite , and then relax it to zero thanks to the instanton  induced effective potential .    in the realm of supersymmetry in particular the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there arises susy cp problem in addition to the strong cp problem .",
    "indeed , the soft  breaking parameters as well as the @xmath0 parameter can have nonvanishing phases @xcite leading to a neutron edm exceeding the bounds by three orders of magnitude , except for certain portions of the susy parameter space where different sparticle contributions cancel @xcite . however , it is clear that even if susy contributions partially cancel to agree with the experiment this is by no means a complete solution of the problem because the strong cp problem is still there .    a simultaneous solution to both strong cp and susy cp problems",
    "have been shown to exist @xcite if there are spontaneously broken global symmetries in the susy  breaking sector . here",
    "all soft masses as well as the @xmath0 parameter possess dynamical phases which realize the global symmetries in the susy  breaking sector nonlinearly . in effect , the relaxation mechanism proposed in @xcite involves promoting the phases of the soft masses to dynamical variables so that ( @xmath3 ) the phases in the quark and gluino mass matrices relax the qcd vacuum angle , and ( @xmath4 ) all phases appearing in the vacuum energy relax to cp  conserving points due to the radiative stability of the vacuum energy .",
    "while former solves the strong cp problem the latter does the susy cp problem .",
    "therefore , the end result of this mechanism is that there is no source of cp violation beyond the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) phase .",
    "however , the mssm suffers from a serious hierarchy problem : the @xmath0 puzzle .",
    "namely , the higgsino bilinear mass parameter , @xmath0 which follows from the superpotential , can be anywhere between the weak scale and the planck scale @xcite .",
    "in fact , the relaxation mechanism in @xcite treats the @xmath0 parameter as a soft mass which is already stabilized at the weak scale . in this context ,",
    "the next  to  minimal supersymmetric sm ( nmssm ) @xcite is the most economic extension of the mssm in which the @xmath0 parameter is induced by the vev of an additional gauge singlet .",
    "one notes that the nmssm not only solves the @xmath0 problem but also offers a rich phenomenology for colliders @xcite and dark matter @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will discuss dynamical relaxation of the cp phases in the nmssm in order to check if it is possible to have a simultaneous solution to the hierarchy problems concerning the strong cp , susy cp and the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "it will be seen that the generalization of the @xmath0 parameter to a local operator modifies the infrared and ultraviolet sensitivities of the vacuum energy whereby offering a different relaxation mechanism . in particular",
    ", the radiative stability of the vacuum energy will no longer be sufficient to relax all cp  violating phases to cp  conserving points .",
    "in fact , there will be remnant physical phases that can contribute to cp  violating quantities like edms or neutral meson mixings .    in sec .",
    "ii we identify the possible sources of explicit cp violation in the tree level nmssm lagrangian .",
    "we then determine the symmetries of the superpotential , and thereby show the need for promoting the phases to dynamical variables .",
    "here we also list down all possible phase ",
    "dependent operators which can contribute to the vacuum energy .    in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the dynamical relaxation processes for the phases .",
    "first we discuss the relaxation of the qcd vacuum angle .",
    "next we estimate radiative corrections to the vacuum energy , and show that the susy cp  violating phases no longer relax to the cp  conserving points .    in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the mssm limit and show that the differences between the two models follow mainly from their global symmetries and assumptions about the @xmath0 parameter .    in sec .",
    "v we summarize the main results of the work and compare them with those of the mssm in a tabular manner .",
    "we discuss also the implications of the results for other cp  violation phenomena .",
    "the superpotential of the nmssm is given by @xmath5 where the yukawa couplings @xmath6 are non  hermitian matrices in the flavor space .",
    "the lagrangian of the model consists of several complex parameters @xmath7 where the first term is the @xmath8term contribution , and the rest are all soft susy  breaking ones . in general the gaugino masses",
    "@xmath9 as well as the triscalar couplings @xmath10 are all complex quantities .",
    "the higgs sector of the theory has three parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 which can violate cp .",
    "after all phase redefinitions of the higgs fields there remains one independent phase , say @xmath14 , which violates cp explicitly .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the mass  eigenstate scalars are mixtures of different cp eigenstates @xcite .",
    "this tree level cp violation is a property of the nmssm . for comparison ,",
    "one notes that in the mssm there is no such effect because possible phase of @xmath15 appearing in @xmath16 can be rotated away after a phase redefinition of the higgs doublets .",
    "therefore , the only way for generating cp violation in the mssm comes by the radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the nmssm superpotential ( [ nmssm ] ) possesses a global continious @xmath17symmetry , @xmath18.rotation @xmath19 variable has charge @xmath20 . if a chiral superfield has charge @xmath21 then the charges of its scalar and fermionic components are , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . ] in fact , this would be a symmetry of the whole lagrangian were it not for the finite gaugino masses ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24terms .",
    "therefore , the soft  breaking terms break the @xmath18 symmetry down to its @xmath25 subgroup which causes the formation of domain walls @xcite . with finite soft masses",
    "the only way of keeping @xmath18 symmetry unbroken is to let them have dynamical phases transforming as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath18 rotation angle , and @xmath28 is the charge of the superpotential ( [ nmssm ] ) @xcite .",
    "therefore all of the gaugino masses and triscalar couplings are now spurions with charges compansating those of the fields , and the theory has a unique global symmetry @xmath18 . the same operation of promoting the soft phases to dynamical variables in the mssm , however , results in two global symmetries : an @xmath17symmetry and a peccei  quinn symmetry @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the tree level vacuum energy .",
    "after introducing the dynamical phases ( [ rchar ] ) the nmssm vacuum manifold is described by the higgs fields , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and dynamical phases of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , a direct minimization of the vacuum energy gives the relations @xmath34=\\mbox{arg}[a_{s}^\\ast],~",
    "\\mbox{arg}[s^{3}]=\\mbox{arg}[a_{k}^\\ast],~ \\mbox{arg}[a_{s } a_{k}^{\\ast}]=\\theta_{s}-\\theta_{k}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 $ ] , and the higgs fields here are replaced by their vacuum expectation values ( vev ) .",
    "these relations fix the phases of the higgs fields in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 phases such that the relative phase between @xmath12 and @xmath13 equals the phase content of the @xmath8term contribution in ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "similar relations are also found in the mssm : @xmath37=- \\mbox{arg}[h_{u}\\cdot h_{d}]$ ] after minimizing the vacuum energy @xcite .    any physical quantity with a nontrivial phase content",
    "is restricted to depend only @xmath18invariant combinations of the mass parameters .",
    "since the higgs fields eventually acquire vevs they can also be included in the list of phase  dependent invariants .",
    "depicted in table i are sets of phase  dependent invariants having mass dimension @xmath38 ( first column ) and @xmath39 ( second column ) . the phase of each combination is listed in the third column in terms of the independent phases @xmath40,\\ \\ \\ \\phi_{k}(x)=\\mbox{arg}[m_{\\lambda}a_{k}^{*}],\\ \\ \\ \\phi_{f}(x)=\\mbox{arg}[m_{\\lambda}a_{f}^{*}]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which will prove useful in comparing the results with those of the mssm . in table",
    "i , @xmath41 stands for the quadratics of the higgs fields .",
    "these phase  dependent operators are all determined by the @xmath17invariance arguments . however , their contribution to the vacuum energy depends on the diagrammatics , and this will be done in the next section .",
    "the radiative stability of the vacuum with respect to the phases will realize the relaxation process .",
    ".[table : back1 ] phase  dependent , @xmath17invariant , @xmath38 and @xmath39 operators and their phases . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     having finite susy cp violation with vanishing qcd vacuum angle is an important property of nmssm not found in the mssm . indeed , with finite @xmath1",
    ", it does not matter if one cancels the susy contributions to edms @xcite , because the qcd contribution anyhow exceeds the bound by several orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it is in the nmssm that one can safely take susy and ckm phases as the mere sources of cp violation , that is , edms of the electron and neutron as well as @xmath42 and @xmath43 can all be calculated without worrying about the effects of the nonperturbative strong interactions . it is a question of the susy parameter space if the calculated values for these observables agree with the experiment .",
    "it may be useful to recall here the relevance of the flavor structure . given the cleo determination of br@xmath44 then there is no possibility that the susy cp violation can saturate the observed cp violation with minimal flavor structure @xcite .",
    "though having finite susy cp violation is necessary it is by no means sufficient ; one has to look for flavor structures beyond the usual yukawa hierarchies .",
    "it is a rather general statement @xcite that all peccei  quinn type solutions to the strong cp problem suffer from the axionic domain walls , which are diastrous cosmologically @xcite .",
    "altough axionic wall formation is an additional problem for the mssm , it exists in the nmssm with and without the dynamical phases so that phase relaxation does not generate a new difficulty in this model .",
    "one of the ways of avoiding the axionic wall formation is to embedd the @xmath17symmetry into the center of a gut group @xcite .",
    "however , in non  gut gauge structures like mssm and nmssm this method does not work .",
    "the only remaining way out of this difficulty is to choose nonminimal flavour structures @xcite such that domain wall number is reduced to unity .",
    "it is in this sense that the question of having observable susy cp violation and avoiding the domain walls might be answered by a common flavor structure .",
    "one further notes that the quadratic short  distance sensitivity of the nmssm vacuum energy arises also in the dynamical flavor matrices @xcite , yukawa couplings @xcite and determinations of the susy  breaking scale @xcite .",
    "the author is grateful to goran senjanovi for numerous discussions and helpful comments about various aspects of this work .",
