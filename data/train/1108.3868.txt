    "by the time the average global star formation rate peaked in galaxies destined to grow to the size of the milky way 13  gyr after the big bang , vigorous heavy metal enrichment had already begun .",

    "each of these two neutron ( @xmath8 ) capture processes contributes about half of the heavy elements in the solar system ( s.s . ) , which samples the chemistry of the interstellar medium ( ism ) at one point in the milky way disc more than 9  gyr after the big bang .",

    "enrichment of the ism by  material may begin a few tens of myr after star formation commences , while  enrichment requires at least 50  myr to several gyr depending on the agb mass ranges involved .",
    "after an early description of the  by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite developed the phenomenological ( also known as the `` classical '' ) approach that dominated  modeling for decades to follow .",
    "this method takes advantage of the fact that the product of the  cross section and the  abundance of each isotope is slowly variable and can be approximated locally as a constant .",

    "the amount of @xmath19c in the pocket can be thought of as one measure of the  efficiency .",

    "these elements are frequently attributed to  nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the consistent  abundance pattern observed in several stars heavily enriched by  material inspired the idea that  abundances everywhere ( at least for @xmath37  56 ) may be scaled versions of the same pattern ; however , stars with less extreme levels of  enrichment clearly deviate from this pattern ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
