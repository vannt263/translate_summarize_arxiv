    "<S> it is shown that nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions of identical ising spins on imbalanced bipartite lattice and imbalanced bipartite hierarchical fractal result in ferrimagnetic order instead of antiferromagnetic one . on some crystal lattices </S>",
    "<S> dilute ising antiferromagnets may also become ferrimagnets due to the imbalanced nature of the magnetic percolation cluster when it coexists with the percolation cluster of vacancies . as evidenced by the existing experiments on @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> such ferrimagnetism is inherent property of bcc lattice so thermodynamics of these compounds at low @xmath1 can be similar to that of antiferromagnet on imbalanced hierarchical fractal .    </S>",
    "<S> the system of the identical ising spins on the sites of some crystalline lattices with the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange may have magnetized ground states . </S>",
    "<S> in such states there would be antiparallel neighboring spins , as interaction dictates , but the whole numbers of up - spins and down - spins would differ . </S>",

    "<S> two sublattices with parallel up and down spins in the ground state are shown by filled and empty circles correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in the unit cell there are one filled circle and two empty ones so we get @xmath3 magnetizations in two globally - reversed ground states for nearest - neighbor af on this lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus this af model has a couple of ferrimagnetic ground states with both staggered @xmath4 and homogeneous @xmath5 magnetizations .    </S>",
    "<S> one can easily show that this ordering persists up to finite @xmath6 . summing the gibbs function over spins on sublattice a ( empty circles ) </S>",
    "<S> we get the gibbs distribution for the spins on the sublattice b having effective ferromagnetic hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for each link with @xmath7 spin we have ( @xmath8 is af exchange ) @xmath9 }   = 2\\cosh \\left [ { \\left ( { { s_b } + { { s'}_b}}{j}/{t } \\right ) } \\right ] \\\\ = 2\\exp \\left [ { { k_b}\\left ( { { s_b}{{s'}_b } + 1 } \\right ) } \\right ] ,   \\qquad 2{k_b } \\equiv \\ln \\cosh \\left ( { 2{j}/{t } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the ordering of @xmath10 spins is described by the ferromagnetic ising model on the square lattice , so @xmath11 for @xmath12 @xcite or @xmath13    . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) - fragment of regular @xmath2 lattice , dotted line shows the unit cell ; ( b , c , d ) - clusters of dilute square lattice . in the ground state </S>",
    "<S> short - range ising af on them would have parallel spins on a and b sublattices and , hence , a nonzero magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> , height=124 ]    as @xmath14 is a linear combination of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the ordered phase is a ferrimagnetic one . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that homogeneous magnetic field @xmath17 has a part conjugated with the order parameter so magnetic susceptibility diverges at @xmath18 when @xmath19 and the transition becomes smeared at finite @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we have a simple example showing that nearest - neighbor af interaction of identical ising spins may result in the macroscopic ferrimagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> this is in apparent distinction with conventional ferrimagnets having several different magnetic moments in a cell . </S>",
    "<S> it may look rather exotic in the realm of real crystals yet such situation can be frequent in disordered ising af , first of all , in dilute ising af on bipartite lattices . </S>",
    "<S> these lattices can be divided in two subsets of sites , a and b , such that all bonds are of the a - b type , i. e. there are no bonds inside a and b subsets @xcite . apparently , the ising af on such lattice is non - frustrated having all spins up on sublattice a and down on sublattice b or vice versa in its two degenerate ground states . </S>",
    "<S> their magnetizations are @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the numbers of sites in a and b sublattices and we choose @xmath23 for definiteness .    seemingly , all known non - frustrated af crystals with just one sort of magnetic ions have bipartite lattices that are the balanced ones , that is with @xmath24 and purely af ground states , while fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) shows the imbalanced bipartite lattice with @xmath23 ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> yet the dilution of balanced bipartite lattices results in appearance of a number of isolated clusters , mostly with @xmath26 , those with @xmath24 being the rare exceptions . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b , c , d ) show the imbalanced clusters on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> so at @xmath27 and arbitrarily small magnetic field dilute bipartite af must show nonzero magnetization due to the presence of such imbalanced finite clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this circumstance was first noticed by neel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still it stays unnoticed that for some concentrations of magnetic ions @xmath1 the giant percolation cluster may also have the average imbalance ratio @xmath28 .    indeed , in finite sample </S>",
    "<S> the role of percolation cluster belong to that with the largest number of sites and very probably it is imbalanced , as most of them . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 will tend to unity if there are only finite clusters of vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , such finite clusters can not make infinite lattice imbalanced as for every cluster deleting unequal number of sites from a and b sublattices there exists ( with the same probability ) the shifted cluster of the same form which restores the balance . </S>",
    "<S> thus at @xmath31 the imbalanced percolation cluster can only exist as a finite - size effect . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , at @xmath32 there is infinite percolation cluster of vacancies to which this argument does not apply . </S>",
    "<S> hence , here @xmath28 may also hold in the @xmath29 limit in some crystal lattices . </S>",
    "<S> then the ground state magnetization of dilute af in this interval will be @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the imbalance distribution function of finite clusters . </S>",
    "<S> now it seems that neither @xmath34 nor @xmath35 are known for the crystal lattices . </S>",
    "<S> so to find them is quite relevant task for the physics of dilute short - range af .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of finite clusters vanishes at finite temperatures , but that of the imbalanced percolation cluster would persist up to a finite @xmath18 and @xmath36 at all @xmath37 due to its geometrical origin </S>",
    "<S> . then macroscopic features of dilute af would be those of ordinary ferromagnet in spite of the presence of antiparallel neighboring spins in the ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the mapping of this model onto random - field ising magnet ( rfim ) @xcite would be no longer valid as it suggests purely af transition in daff . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility of af order breaking is missed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which is a consequence of the mean - field treatment of homogeneous magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> the evidences in favor of daff ferrimagnetism can be found in experiments on several dilute ising af with @xmath38 showing the remanent magnetization with the usual order - parameter behavior @xcite-@xcite and prominent peak in temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility which appears in low fields as a result of dilution and becomes gradually smeared in higher fields @xcite,@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we should note that on the lattices having perfectly balanced percolation cluster with @xmath39 daff also have a ferrimagnetic phase in its ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the difference with the imbalanced case is that it appears above some finite critical field @xmath40 while this field is zero if @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic ground state phase diagrams are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of these pictures follows from quite simple considerations . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the perfectly balanced af percolation cluster . </S>",
    "<S> as it necessary has some imbalanced ( magnetized ) parts , the field will induce the energy - reducing global flipping of their spins if the magnetic moment @xmath16 of the part points opposite to the field and @xmath17 is greater than @xmath41 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 is the number of af bonds connecting the given part with the rest of percolation cluster , @xmath8 is af exchange . </S>",
    "<S> first the large clusters with small @xmath43 ratio will be flipped in low fields while the field growth will induce the flipping of smaller and smaller ones . at last the remaining single spins flip along the field at @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the lattice coordination number ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding jumps of sublattice magnetizations are seen in the numerical study of the ground state of @xmath46 ( simple cubic ) daff with @xmath1 as large as 0.9 and @xmath47 @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> phase diagrams of dilute af . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) @xmath48 for all @xmath1 , ( b ) @xmath49 for @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the lines between phases are defined by @xmath40 and @xmath51 discussed in text . in the improper ferrimagnetic regions </S>",
    "<S> sharp af transition is preserved at finite @xmath18 while it becomes smeared ferrimagnetic one at @xmath52 in genuine ferrimagnetic region in ( b).,height=377 ]    apparently , this process results in appearance of a nonzero magnetization of percolation cluster in fields above some @xmath53 and vanishing of its staggered magnetization above some greater field @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> so the ground state at @xmath55 is ferrimagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> yet in this case @xmath16 appears at @xmath18 as a secondary order parameter @xmath56 and here sharp af transition is preserved as well as daff - rfim mapping . </S>",
    "<S> so we may call this phase improper ferrimagnetic to distinguish it from the genuine ferrimagnetic one in fig [ fig.2]b .    </S>",
    "<S> still the improper ferrimagnetic ground state would cause a drastic change in the dynamics of af phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is the consequence of huge degeneracy of the ferrimagnetic ground state as at rational @xmath57 there can be a huge amount of parts of the percolation cluster with @xmath58 so their flipping does not change the energy . </S>",
    "<S> this degeneracy is explicitly demonstrated in numerical studies of realistic daff systems @xcite , @xcite . at finite @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> this results in many ( nearly ) degenerate minima of thermodynamic potential so the system can be trapped in each of them , depending on the previous history of @xmath37 and @xmath17 variations . </S>",
    "<S> the particular manifestation of these phenomena is the difference between field - cooled and zero - field - cooled thermodynamic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , it would be also present in the ferrimagnetic phase of imbalanced daff right down to @xmath19 .    concerning the behavior of @xmath59 and @xmath51 in fig [ fig.2 ] we can note that it is quite apparent that @xmath60 while their diminishing to zero at @xmath61 in fig [ fig.2]a is the consequence of sparse structure of percolation cluster near @xmath62 . here </S>",
    "<S> it is divided into loosely connected parts with @xmath63 so their flipping fields also go to zero resulting in @xmath64 . in fig </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2]b @xmath40 seized to exist at @xmath65 when , according to our surmise , @xmath30 becomes less than 1 in some lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> the notion of @xmath40 and @xmath51 behavior one can get from the results of extensive numerical studies of daff ground state on simple cubic and bcc lattices @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries of the so called `` domain state '' are determined . in this state the percolation cluster of the flipped spins coexists with that of unflipped ones . </S>",
    "<S> its upper boundary coincides with @xmath51 while the lower one can be somewhat higher than @xmath40 , yet its behavior for the simple cubic lattice @xcite resembles that in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2]a . </S>",
    "<S> so , most probably , this lattice has @xmath39 for all @xmath1 . </S>",
