    "since the radial velocity technique can yield only lower mass limits , all planets ( or planet candidates ) found by this technique have to be confirmed by other methods .",
    "of @xmath2 radial velocity planet candidates found so far , 14 have been confirmed by transit and two by astrometry , see e.g. exoplanet.eu .",

    "2004 ) , with a precision down to 0.04 mas ( milli arc sec ) sufficient to detect the wobble of the host star in the plane of the sky .",
    "the astrometric displacement is given by @xmath3 = 0.960 \\times \\frac{a}{[5\\,au ] } \\times \\frac{[10\\,pc]}{d } \\times \\frac{m_{pl}}{[m_{jup } ] } \\times \\frac{[m_{\\odot}]}{m_{\\star}}\\ ] ] with planet mass @xmath4 in jupiter masses at a semi - major axis @xmath5 ( in units of 5 au ) in a circular orbit around a host star with mass @xmath6 in solar masses at a distance @xmath7 ( in units of 10 pc ) .    here , we present both a feasibility study to determine the astrometric precision of the adaptive optics ( ao ) camera naos - conica ( naco ) of the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) as well as first measurements in order to determine the mass of hd 19994 ab , a rv planet candidate in orbit around hd 19994 : the rv data suggest a lower mass limit of the planet candidate of @xmath8 in an orbit with semi - major axis @xmath9 au with an eccentricity of @xmath10 , i.e. a @xmath11 day orbital period ( mayor et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the full ( peak - to - peak ) astrometric wobble , from kepler s 3rd law , is at least 0.155 mas ( for a circular orbit ) and 0.131 mas by taking the observed eccentricity into account  this is when assuming the minimum mass @xmath12 as true mass .",
    "we observed hd 19994 and a calibration binary ( hd 19063 ) with the s13 camera ( 13.26 mas / pixel pixel scale , 14@xmath13 @xmath14 14@xmath13 fov ) in a nb_2.17 narrow band filter .",
    "short exposures of both target binaries where taken for one hour each , equally splitted up into two time slots before and after meridian passage .",
    "we obtained a total of 120 frames for hd 19994 and 117 frames for hd 19063 .",
    "data reduction followed the standard technique of dark subtraction , division by a flat field and the application of a bad pixel mask with the _ eclipse _ software . in each single exposure",
    "( 0.347 sec ) , we measured the separation between a and b of both binaries .",
    "we have then made sure that the separations follow white noise by a k - s test ( see a future paper by neuhuser et al . for details ) .",
    "hence , we can devide the standard deviation of the mean by the square root of the number of measurements to obtain the precision of the separation measurement , the _ precision _ , not the _ accuracy_. for the latter , we would need to know the true pixel scale .",
    "see figure 1 and table 1 .",
    "error for individual measurements .",
    "the standard deviation of the complete dataset is shown as dashed lines and grey - shaded areas for 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean , thus the precision of the measured binary separation , is @xmath16.,width=464 ]    .astrometric results from the measurements of the binaries hd 19994 and hd 19063 .",
    "k - s test values higher than 0.6 are interpreted as indicating white noise .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     differential chromatic refraction ( drc ) or allan noise ( see pravdo & shaklan 1996 ) do not matter here , because we observe in the near ir with a narrow - band filter ( hence no dcr ) and with ao ( hence no allan noise ) .",
    "we have observed two bright visual binaries ( 0.6 to 2.4 arc sec separation ) with vlt / nacos smallest pixel scale ( 13.26 mas / pixel ) by taking @xmath17 short ( 0.347 s ) exposures per binary within a few hours , separated in four bins of @xmath18 exposures each ( 15 december 2004 , eso program 075.c-0288.a ) .",
    "we could confirm that the separations measured follow white noise ( in three out of four bins ) , so that we are allowed to divide the mean of the separations by the square root of the number of measurements to obtain the precision of the separation measurement . by doing so , we measured the separation between hd 19994 a and b to be @xmath19 mas ( milli arc seconds ) with the relative precision of @xmath20 ( micro arc seconds ) . for hd 19063",
    ", we obtained @xmath21 mas with a precision being as low as @xmath22 .",
    "these are the most precise measurements in relative astrometry obtained with single - aperture telescopes from the ground , sufficient to detect the astrometric wobble due to a planet , to be seen as periodic change in the binary separation .",
    "such a high precision as shown here can be applied not only to measurements of masses of previously detected rv planets ( or candidates ) , but also to search for new planets in wide binaries , or even single stars with a bright ( back- or foreground ) star within the isoplanatic angle .",
    "other possible applications are orbit determinations in stellar multiples , ground - based parallaxe and proper motion measurements , observations of expanding , contracting , or rotating star clusters , etc .",
    "the main limitation of this technique is the need for a bright star near the target , namely within the isoplanatic angle . and",
    ", as long as no pixel scale calibrator is available with a precision down to 1/100000 , the measurement can achieve this high precision only for relative astrometry , but not in absolute terms ."
