    "a @xmath01.3-gyr old galactic open cluster , trumpler  20 ( hereafter tr  20 ; @xmath7 @xmath8 ) was first correctly characterized by @xcite .",
    "its basic properties such as age , distance , and reddening were later confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies also indicate that the red clump of tr  20 has a peculiar morphology ; possibly , it is dual . in addition , the upper main sequence appears to show an enlarged color spread that is not normally seen in the color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for open clusters in this age group .",
    "this observational evidence hints at the now - popular conjecture of multiple stellar populations , suggested for a number of the magellanic cloud ( mc ) clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies of rich intermediate - age ( 12  gyr ) star clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) indicate that their extended main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) regions can be described by continuous star formation , lasting @xmath00.3 gyr or longer @xcite .",
    "this long period of star formation , however , seems to be at odds with the fact that none of the younger clusters are known to have such a trait .",
    "alternative interpretations include , for example , stellar rotation effects @xcite and interactions in binary systems @xcite .",
    "however , according to @xcite , stellar rotation is not a likely physical process to produce extended msto .",
    "although extended star formation is generally accepted as the main factor in generating atypical cmds for a number of mc star clusters , this scenario is based solely on interpretation of the photometric data .",
    "an exception is the analysis of chemical abundances in four intermediate - age lmc clusters @xcite . among them , ngc  1783 is a star cluster with an extended msto @xcite ; however , it lacks convincing anticorrelation in the na  o and mg  al abundances , observed in the galactic globular clusters with multiple populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this might be an indication that younger star clusters with extended msto may not experience self - enrichment .",
    "the open cluster tr  20 is important for two reasons : ( 1 ) if proven , it would be the first known _ open cluster _ with multiple stellar populations in the milky way ; ( 2 ) the relative proximity of tr  20 ( @xmath9  kpc ) permits high - resolution spectroscopy of its upper main sequence .",
    "this provides the crucial observational data on projected rotational velocities , @xmath10 , which are scarce for the main - sequence stars of 12  gyr old star clusters .",
    "such data can be used to test theoretical predictions on the significance of stellar rotation on morphology of cmd . in this letter , we discuss the results of high - accuracy photometry of tr  20 combined with measured radial velocities and @xmath10 for the entire upper part of the cluster s cmd .",
    "detailed results of this study will be published elsewhere ( i.  platais et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the photometric ccd observations of tr  20 were obtained on three observing runs in 20082009 at the ctio 1.0  m telescope , operated by the small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) consortium .",
    "the instrumental setup included an sta @xmath11 ccd featuring 15  @xmath12 m pixels and covering a field of view of @xmath13 .",
    "exposure times for tr  20 ranged from 10 to 600  s. each night a large number of landolt s standards ( 57112 ) were frequently observed in order to assure the best possible calibration of instrumental magnitudes based upon empirical and field - variable point - spread function .",
    "fringing in the sky background was substantial in the @xmath14 filter and was removed accordingly .",
    "the observed spread of extinction , color , and zeropoint terms in the transformations to the standard system indicates excellent photometric quality of the sky .",
    "the combined photometry for 96,156 stars covers a @xmath15 area down to @xmath16 with formal accuracies reaching 0.003  mag for optimally exposed stars .",
    "spectroscopic observations of tr  20 were conducted in 2009 april  may using the very large telescope ( vlt)/flames / giraffe multi - object spectrograph in its medusa mode , which can allocate up to 132 fibers over a circular field - of - view with a diameter of 25@xmath17 . the chosen high - resolution mode h525.8b offers resolution @xmath18 at the central wavelength of @xmath19  5258   .",
    "our sample of targets contains photometric cluster members selected from the cluster s cmd over a field of @xmath13 from @xcite .",
    "it includes the entire red giant branch ( rgb ) , all possible subgiants , and the complete upper main sequence down to @xmath20 , equivalent to @xmath21 ( f2f5v spectral type ) .",
    "the cmd of the observed stars is discussed in section  3 .",
    "a total of 954 stars were observed using nine fiber configurations , each taken with 1  hr of exposure time that resulted in signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 1570 for the entire sample .",
    "each target star was observed only once .",
    "our goal was to maximize the number of main - sequence cluster members , while ignoring potential binaries and concentrating on likely single stars with radial velocities consistent with cluster membership .",
    "the data were reduced using the giraffe baseline data reduction software @xcite , which follows through the usual steps of spectroscopic reductions .",
    "in addition , we modeled the sky and subtracted it from the spectra of main - sequence stars .",
    "radial velocities @xmath22 and projected rotational velocities @xmath10 were first derived by cross - correlating the spectrum of each star with box - shaped - line digital templates , constructed from the high - resolution and high - s / n spectra ( f0v and k0iii , accordingly ) of slowly rotating stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) was then fitted with a gaussian whose parameters served in deriving @xmath22 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these techniques work well for rgb stars , which have intrinsically low @xmath10 values , and for the main - sequence stars with @xmath23  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "there is a hint that with increasing @xmath10 the radial velocities become biased , and for @xmath24  km  s@xmath4 this method often fails because the narrow noise peaks , significantly enhanced by relatively low s / n of our spectra , start to dominate the ccf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these shortcomings of the fixed - template techniques and the desire to measure higher @xmath10 cases prompted us to undertake a different approach .",
    "to determine stellar atmospheric parameters and radial velocities , we used the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) library of synthetic spectra , which covers the entire wavelength range of the giraffe spectra .",
    "the present version of the library was calculated by john laird for a grid of kurucz model atmospheres @xcite , using a line list developed by jon morse .",
    "we broadened the library to match the actual instrumental resolution of the observed spectra , which we determined to be fwhm=@xmath25 by fitting the width of thar lines .",
    "similar to the analysis in @xcite , we cross - correlated each star against the grid of synthetic spectra with the iraf task xcsao and , using the normalized ccf peak heights at each grid point , we interpolated to the stellar parameters yielding the maximum correlation value .",
    "we assign errors of half the grid spacing  @xmath26  k in @xmath27 , @xmath28  @xmath29 in @xmath10 ( with smaller errors for slowly rotating stars ) , and @xmath30 dex in @xmath31 and [ @xmath32/h ] .",
    "spectroscopic determinations of @xmath27 , @xmath31 , and [ @xmath32/h ] can be correlated , potentially causing systematic errors larger than the nominal errors quoted here , but constraining [ @xmath32/h ] to equal the cluster metallicity can help to break that degeneracy .",
    "we used the red clump cluster members ( see section  3 ) to determine [ @xmath32/h]@xmath33 and then performed the interpolation again with the metallicity fixed .",
    "we also note , as hinted with the other techniques , that the radial velocities are redshifted in the amount of about @xmath34 per unit @xmath10 value .",
    "the cmd of tr  20 shows a heavy contamination by field stars , mostly from the carina spiral arm @xcite .",
    "our sample of nearly a thousand photometrically selected probable cluster members can now be cleaned up by using radial velocities .",
    "first , we examined radial velocities ( see section  2.2.1 ) of the red clump stars to derive the mean cluster velocity .",
    "a sample of 68 red clump stars yields @xmath35 km  s@xmath4 and is our adopted mean radial velocity for tr  20 .",
    "a similar estimate from radial velocities based upon synthetic templates gives @xmath36 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "second , we used @xmath10 and @xmath22 to select the probable kinematic cluster members ( figure  1 ) . our final sample of kinematic members of tr  20 consists of 471 stars with a caveat that among them @xmath050100 stars ( 10%20% ) , estimated by two different statistical methods ( ad hoc analysis of @xmath10 distribution and a formal cluster membership calculation in the bins of @xmath10 ) , can still be field stars , predominantly at @xmath37 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the cmd of our kinematic cluster - member sample ( figure  2 ) shows some intriguing features . in order to represent and interpret them , here we chose a @xmath38 cmd .",
    "first , the msto region appears to be split into two parts : a narrow but sparse blue sequence and a bulky redder one .",
    "we note that a split of the upper main sequence in tr  20 is unusual compared to the cmds of selected lmc star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which all show a smooth and progressively widening msto toward the higher luminosities .",
    "second , in the sense of a sequence , the rgb stars are difficult to identify .",
    "essentially , there are only two distinct `` blobs '' of red stars .",
    "the most conspicuous one at @xmath39 represents the red clump , which appears to be significantly elongated along both axes .",
    "the second , at @xmath40 , represents the rgb clump , which is well matched by the isochrones ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "prior to interpreting these features , we first probed the cluster for signs of differential reddening ( dr ) .",
    "in cmds of star clusters older than @xmath01  gyr , dr affects mostly the morphology of the msto region and the rgb including the red clump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our approach in estimating dr is based on the assumption that there is an empirical blue envelope of the main sequence , indicating cluster stars with the _ lowest _ reddening as shown by the curve in figure  2 .",
    "this envelope conforms with the adopted youngest isochrone to the cluster s cmd .",
    "next , we partially de - reddened each main - sequence star ( for tr  20 , down to @xmath41 ) so that they lie exactly on the blue envelope .",
    "a zero dr is adopted for a few probable cluster members bluer than this envelope .",
    "thus , in our notation , dr is never negative . to mitigate the potential correlation between dr and the effects of stellar rotation",
    ", we used only the stars with @xmath42 km  s@xmath4 ( a total of 237 ) .",
    "a raw map of estimated dr ( figure  3 ) shows a distinct window of lower reddening in the nw corner of tr  20 , consistent with the galactic reddening maps of @xcite .",
    "the amount of dr is then smoothed on a grid of tangential coordinates at @xmath43 steps ( figure  3 ) . at each grid point , the median dr is calculated from the nearest few measurements . the average size of a constant reddening patch ( @xmath44 , equivalent to the eight nearest measures ) was estimated by minimizing the color dispersion in the dr - corrected upper main sequence . after correcting for dr , there is a substantial improvement in the tightness of all the features in the cmd ( figure  2 ) .",
    "dr is clearly the main reason for the unusual appearance of the observed cmd for tr  20 .",
    "the following isochrone fits to our photometric data indicate that the lowest reddening toward tr  20 is @xmath2 for stars with @xmath45 , while the maximum amount of dr reaches @xmath00.1  mag .",
    "this range of @xmath46 is consistent with the earlier estimates of reddening @xcite .",
    "we note that the other effects such as unresolved or interacting binaries and rotation of stars may partially mimic the appearance of dr .",
    "we used a set of padova isochrones @xcite generated for the metal abundance of @xmath47 .",
    "the isochrones were reddened using the prescription of deriving a variable @xmath46 given in @xcite and @xcite . in order to achieve a reasonable match of isochrones with the features of rgb",
    ", the parameter @xmath48 defined as @xmath48=@xmath49(sp  t)@xmath50(b0 ) @xcite should be revised to @xmath51 .",
    "reddening in @xmath52 bandpasses was translated to @xmath53 using the coefficients from @xcite .",
    "our best fit is achieved with a 1.3  gyr isochrone and the true distance modulus @xmath54=12.60 mag .",
    "the morphology of the dr - corrected red clump is unusual  it is substantially extended along the magnitude axis ( @xmath55 ) , having its highest density at @xmath56 .",
    "there is a certain similarity to a double red clump of the smc star cluster ngc  419 ; however , the lack of multiple populations in tr  20 and , hence , the absence of the required @xmath00.1  gyr span of ages appears to weaken the hypothesis of non - degenerate he cores @xcite .",
    "we also used the isochrones from the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite . a noted 0.2  gyr age difference from the fit with padova isochrones",
    "( figure  4 ) is likely due to differences in the treatment of convective core overshoot and updated nuclear reaction rates , especially for the cno cycle .",
    "@xcite were first to predict the effect of stellar rotation on the color and magnitude of a star , claiming that stellar rotation is essentially tantamount to reddening .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that stellar rotation in stars with masses in the range 1.21.7@xmath57 can mimic the effect of multiple populations in star clusters by shifting these stars to redder colors in the cmd .",
    "this proposition was contested by @xcite on the grounds of evolutionary tracks for non - rotating and rotating stars .",
    "these authors conclude that stellar models with rotation appear to produce a modest blueshift in the cmd .",
    "clearly , our data can provide a crucial test of these predictions .",
    "first , from the dr - corrected @xmath52 cmd we selected a sample of 168 upper main - sequence stars down to @xmath58  the part of a cmd containing a relatively high fraction of fast rotators .",
    "second , the @xmath59 cmd of this new sample was rotated around the point @xmath60 , @xmath61 in such a way that the magnitude axis becomes approximately parallel to the selected short segment of a 1.3  gyr isochrone .",
    "the rms of the color distribution for the modified dr - corrected @xmath62 of these stars is 0.04 mag .",
    "the modified colors served as an argument in constructing the histograms of fast and slow rotators , divided into equal parts at @xmath63 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "similar to @xcite , we used the nonparametric epanechnikov - kernel probability density function to smooth the histograms , normalized relative to the maximum counts of slow rotators .",
    "the resulting color distributions are shown for two cases : using @xmath59 photometry `` as is '' and correcting it for dr ( figure  5 ) .",
    "our data show that at 1.3  gyr and in the mass range of 1.5 - 1.8@xmath64 stellar rotation produces a slight to zero blueshift of stars in the dr - corrected cmd : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "all median color differences are between the fast and slow rotators .",
    "this effect appears to be 1.3 to 3 times magnified in the dr - uncorrected @xmath59 and @xmath68 cmds , accordingly , which can be attributed to a likely anticorrelation between the rotational blueshift and dr .    to validate these findings",
    ", we explored the likelihood of a chance blueshift in our sample .",
    "we constructed a synthetic cluster with all physical parameters close to those of our selection of tr  20 members , particularly , the total number of stars on the main sequence and the pattern of dr .",
    "the only variable was a level of reddening `` noise '' added to the grid of median dr ( figure  3 ) . from a 1000 realizations of a synthetic cluster , each time we randomly chose 168 stars and calculated the median @xmath62 color difference between the `` fast '' and `` slow '' rotators . in the absence of stellar rotation ,",
    "the standard deviation of these median differences is @xmath69 and it is only weakly dependent on the level of the applied dr - noise .",
    "thus , in a statistical sense the estimated color offset due to the stellar rotation is a @xmath70 result and agrees qualitatively with the theoretical predictions by @xcite .",
    "near the msto , a @xmath66 color offset for the 1.3  gyr isochrone corresponds to an age shift of @xmath020  myr . considering the median difference of @xmath060 km  s@xmath4 between the slow and fast rotators and extrapolating it to the entire range of @xmath10 ( 180 km  s@xmath4 )",
    ", we obtain a tentative `` dispersion '' in isochrone ages of @xmath060  myr .",
    "this is only @xmath015% of the deduced average spread of ages reported by @xcite .",
    "we note that contamination of the slow - rotator sample by field stars and fast rotators at high inclination angles masquerading as slow rotators , can reduce the true color dispersion by @xmath00.01 mag . even accounting for this",
    ", the stellar rotation appears to have a marginal effect on the morphology of msto .",
    "this study of the galactic open cluster tr  20 provides strong evidence that dr can mimic the appearance of multiple populations in star clusters . despite some earlier indications",
    ", tr  20 appears to contain a single coeval population of stars .",
    "positions of the upper main - sequence stars in the cmd of tr  20 are marginally dependent on their projected rotational velocities and in a specific way .",
    "our data show that high @xmath10 stars are slightly blueshifted .",
    "stellar rotation appears to play merely a minor role in the observed broadening of msto of this intermediate - age open cluster .",
