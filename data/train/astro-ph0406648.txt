    "coronal lines ( cl ) are collisionally excited forbidden transitions within low - lying levels of highly ionized species ( ip@xmath5100 ev ) . they can be formed either by a hard uv continuum ( marconi et al .",
    "1996 ; ferguson et al .",
    "1997 ) , a very hot collisionally ionized plasma ( viegas - aldrovandi & contini 1989 ) , or a combination of both processes ( contini et al . 1998 ) . due to the high energies involved in their production ,",
    "the detection of cl is taken as an unambiguous signature of nuclear activity and can provide clues on the uv to soft x - ray spectral energy distribution of the active nucleus ( prieto et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "observationally , cl are blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy ( @xmath6v @xmath1 500 - 800 km / s ) and broader than low ionization lines ( penston et al . 1984 ) .",
    "this has led to the idea that cl are associated to outflows ( erkens et al .",
    "1997 ) and formed in a separate region ( termed as coronal line region , clr ) located between the classical narrow line region ( nlr ) and broad line region . however , both the physical conditions of the coronal gas and the size of the emitting region are matters of strong controversy ( erkens et al .",
    "1997 ; nazarova et al .",
    "published results usually rely on measurements made on just a few cls and information about the size of their emitting regions , on the same target , is very scarce .    with the above in mind ,",
    "the goals of this work are : _",
    "( i ) _ observe a sample of well - known agn in order to measure the size of the emitting region for different coronal lines ; _",
    "( ii ) _ model the observe emission to obtain clues on the physical conditions of the clr ; _ ( iii ) _ study the kinematics of the coronal gas and compare it to that of other nlr lines .",
    "a sub - sample of the observed data , collected using vlt / isaac at eso for ngc1068 and circinus , is presented in figure  [ clr ] .",
    "the spatial scale of the detector ( 0.15/pix ) , combined with the good seeing during the observations ( @xmath10.6  ) allowed us to map gas emission at a spatial resolution down to 20pc .",
    "the slit in both configurations was oriented north - south .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ clr ] shows that in circinus the [ sivii ] line extends from the unresolved nucleus ( r@xmath417pc ) , up to @xmath170pc to the north and 34pc to the south , implying a total size of @xmath1100pc for the [ sivii ] emitting region . in contrasts , [ sivi ] ( not shown in the figure  [ clr ] ) is limited to the central @xmath170pc .",
    "these values , however , are larger than those derived by oliva et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who estimated that the size of the clr in circinus was only @xmath110pc .",
    "due to the better sensitivity of our data , we show that the coronal gas extends farther out from the centre than previously found . for comparison ,",
    "note that the h@xmath7 lines in figure  [ clr ] are detected in all regions where spectra were extracted .",
    "is in arbitrary units.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   is in arbitrary units.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    in ngc1068 , both [ sivi ] and [ sivii ] extends from the unresolved nucleus to 90pc south and up to 40pcnorth ( bottom and upper left panels of figure  [ clr ] ) .",
    "these values , however , are significantly lower than that of @xmath1300pc to the south and 200pc to the north derived from _ nicmos _ [ sivi ] imaging of thompson et al .",
    "note , however , that the thomson et al s data may be misleading because of contamination of [ sivi ] 1.963@xmath0 m by h@xmath7 1.957@xmath0 m , easily seen in figure  [ clr ] , where both lines are heavily blended . at 88pc from the nucleus , [ sivi ] 1.963@xmath0 m and h@xmath7 1.957@xmath0 m have similar strengths and at distances larger than 120pc , only the h@xmath7 is detected .",
    "overall , our data show that all cl are emitted in the inner 100pc of the active nucleus .",
    "when compared to low - ionization and molecular lines , we found that the emitting region of the latter two set of lines extends to much larger distances ( r@xmath5 500pc ) .",
    "this result rules out the hypothesis of ferguson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) of a a low - density clr extending up to 1kpc from the active nucleus but also rules out very compact clr with upper limits of a few parsecs .",
    "we tested the possibility of the cl being emitted from distances of up to several tens of parsecs from the central engine assuming pure photoionization . for this purpose , we run models with the aangaba code ( gruenwald & viegas 1992 ) .",
    "the adopted spectral energy distribution ( sed ) was that suggested by fig .",
    "7 of oliva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for circinus .",
    "two values of luminosities of the ionizing radiation were adopted : @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 and and @xmath10 erg s@xmath9 , suggested by ferguson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and oliva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , respectively .",
    "the number of ionizing photons , @xmath11 , provided by these the two seds are 2.5@xmath12 s@xmath9and 2.5@xmath13 s@xmath9 .",
    "density was varied from 10@xmath2 @xmath14 to 10@xmath15 @xmath14 .",
    "three values for the ionization parameter @xmath16 were employed : 10@xmath17 , 10@xmath18 and 10@xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ ions ] shows the distribution of the ionic fraction of iron and silicon versus the size of the emitting cloud for the three values of @xmath16 employed . note that r , equivelent to the cloud size , is measured from the side of the cloud facing the ionizing radiation to the outer edge .",
    "the value of density that best reproduces the observations is @xmath19=10@xmath20 @xmath14 , in accord to that of 0.5@xmath2110@xmath20 @xmath14 determined for the clr from the [ nev ] 14.3@xmath0 m / 24.3@xmath0 m line ratio with _ iso _ ( moorwood et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the results show that an @xmath22 is necessary in order to have clouds with an ionization structure similar to that observed @xmath23i.e . , simultaneous presence of [ sivi ] , [ sivii ] , and [ fevii ] through [ fexi ] .",
    "in addition , for the parameters adopted , the emitting clouds must located within 8 to 30 pc from the central engine .",
    "coronal emission located farther out from the source would requiere @xmath24 ergs@xmath9 .",

    "the kinematics of the coronal gas was studied by comparing the emission line profiles of low and high excitation lines .",
    "figure  [ clr : kin ] show the results obtained for circinus and ngc3783 .",
    "as is easily seen , the coronal lines in both objects are highly asymmetric towards the blue and broader than low - ionization lines .",
    "previous works on circinus ( oliva et al . 1994 , 1999 ) had failed to detect any significant variation between the width and the ip of the forbidden lines .",
    "in fact , moorwood et al . ( 1996 ) had reported narrower widths in high excitation lines than in lower excitation lines .",
    "the vlt / isaac and ntt / emmi spectra of figure  [ clr : kin ] remove this ambiguity and shows the presence of coronal gas with velocities close to 500 kms@xmath9 in circinus .",
    "blue asymmetric profiles are also observed in ngc3783 .",
    "note , however , that the line profile of [ fexi ] implies radial velocities of up to 1500 kms@xmath9 , suggesting as in circinus , that part of the gas must arise in outflows very close to the central engine .",
    "of the six objects studied , only ngc1068 shows no difference between the fwhm of low and high ionization lines .",
    "emmi / ntt and isaac / vlt spectra are used to determine the size of the clr in a sample of well - known seyfert 1 galaxies by means of the simultaneous observation of [ fevii ] , [ fex ] , [ fexi ] , [ sivi ] and [ sivii ] lines .",
    "our data show that all coronal lines are emitted from the unresolved nucleus to distances of up to 80 pc .",
    "we showed that the coronal emission region can arise from gas photoionized from radiation of the central engine if @xmath250.1 , @xmath2610@xmath20 @xmath14 , solar abundances , cloud sizes of @xmath11 pc and distances from the central source of up to 30 pc .",
    "the analysis of the coronal emission line profiles shows that they are highly asymmetric towards the blue , even in circinus , where previous observations had measured widths of the order of 100 kms@xmath9 . for this object",
    ", we found coronal gas with velocities of up to 400 kms@xmath9 , suggesting that shocks must probably contribute to the observed emission ."
