    "clusters of galaxies map peaks in the cosmic density field and as such can be used to determine information about the universe on the largest scales  @xcite . in particular , the abundance of clusters as a function of mass and redshift has been shown to be a particularly sensitive probe of cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the matter density parameter and the linear rms matter fluctuation within a spherical top - hat of 8 @xmath6 mpc radius respectively . ]  @xcite . in order to link the observed mass function of clusters to an underlying cosmology one must appeal to an analytic description of cluster abundance  @xcite or to one of many numerical studies investigating dark matter halo formation , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "one of the most commonly adopted descriptions of cluster halo abundance is the  @xcite mass function ( tmf hereafter ) .",
    "the implicit assumption made in linking simulated dark matter halo masses with galaxy cluster masses is that the ratio of baryons to dark matter within clusters does not differ significantly from the cosmic value .",
    "this assumption , however , has been challenged by multi - wavelength observations  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown in @xmath7-body simulations that the pressure forces within baryonic gas are capable of segregating the distribution of collisional gas relative to pressure - less dark matter  @xcite thereby changing the baryon fraction within clusters  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies have also shown that galaxy formation processes and non - gravitational heating can modify the baryon fraction  @xcite and thereby the total mass within clusters  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the cluster mass function from observations requires the calibration of an _ observable - mass _ ( @xmath8 ) relation , where common observables , @xmath9 , are x - ray luminosity , galaxy richness and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) flux .",
    "multiple ongoing observational surveys including the _ planck _ mission  @xcite , the south pole telescope survey ( spt ;  @xcite ) , dark energy survey ( des ;  @xcite ) and",
    "the _ xmm _ cluster survey ( xcs ;  @xcite ) have made the cosmological analysis of the galaxy cluster mass function one of their key scientific goals . in order to parameterise the systematic uncertainties in the measurement of a given scaling relation , e.g. of incorrectly assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in clusters , the mass bias parameter @xmath10 is commonly employed , where @xmath11 is the mass inferred from observable @xmath9 .    in the near future ,",
    "large volume observational surveys such as _ erosita _",
    "@xcite , _ euclid _",
    "@xcite , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ;  @xcite ) and the proposed prism mission will detect a greater number of galaxy clusters than ever before .",
    "it is therefore of great importance that the cluster mass function is accurately calibrated against theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "recent results from the _ planck _ cluster survey  @xcite have been found to be in tension with cosmological parameter determinations made using anisotropies in the _ cosmic microwave background _",
    "( cmb ;  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been argued that the discrepancy between the two measured values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 could be due , in part , to cluster biases and selection effects .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that the influence of additional physical processes , such as the influence of massive neutrinos on the power spectrum , could lead to an underestimation in the mass function .    in this paper",
    ", we use large cosmological simulations with baryonic physics to investigate whether such tension can at least in part be explained by the effects of baryonic depletion in clusters .",
    "such an effect , due to gas being expelled by feedback processes , produces a shift in the cluster mass function to lower abundance at fixed mass which if not accounted for in the cosmological analysis , leads to derived values for cosmological parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) that are systematically underestimated .",
    "the remainder of the paper can be summarised as follows . in section  [ sec : sim_selection ] , we outline details of the simulations used and how the cluster samples were defined . in section  [ sec : cluster_mf ] , our main results are presented , quantifying the effect of the baryon depletion on the mass function and its subsequent effect on the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , before suggesting a simple corrective procedure .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss our results in the context of other work in the literature and draw conclusions .",
    "we use results from three cosmological millennium gas simulations ( mgs ;  @xcite ) and two dark matter - only versions of the same volumes .",
    "the mgs are designed to include the dynamics of gas that were not present in the dark matter - only millennium simulations .",
    "each simulation in the suite is run with a different treatment of large scale baryonic physics .",

    "the goand pcsimulations were run using the ` gadget-2 ` code @xcite with the same cosmological model as the millennium simulation  @xcite .",

    "one caveat of note is that in the fomodel the baryonic contribution to the gravitational potential is ignored . in other words ,",
    "the gas is evolved with zero gravitational mass and so there is no baryon - dark matter back - reaction .",

    "in addition , the foand dm2simulations were carried out using cosmological parameters consistent with the 7-year _ wmap _ results ( _ _ wmap__7 ;  @xcite ) : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "clusters were identified from the simulated density field using combinations of the friends of friends ( fof ;  @xcite ) , ` subfind `  @xcite and spherical overdensity  @xcite algorithms ( see @xcite for a review of halo - finding techniques ) . in all of the analysis presented here",
    "we consider clusters with mass @xmath35 .",
    "these clusters correspond to groups containing @xmath36 particles .    in the first generation mgs ( go , pc ) and dm1simulation , clusters were identified using the procedure outlined in  @xcite . briefly",

    "the linking length parameter was chosen to be smaller than the canonical @xmath38 in order to avoid the so called `` over - bridging '' problem whereby distinct , neighbouring haloes are linked together @xcite .",
    "next , the centre of each cluster was identified as the dark matter particle with the most negative gravitational potential energy .",
    "finally the bulk properties of the clusters ( mass , radii , etc . )",

    "there are 707 and 830 clusters with @xmath47 within the range of interest , for the foand dm2models , respectively .",
    "the different number of clusters found in dm1and dm2is mainly due to the fact that they utilise different cosmological models .",

    "in fact , the correction procedure does not appear to improve agreement between the go / pccontours and the dm1 .",

    "although further study is required in order to fully model the gas physics in clusters , we have shown that the baryon fraction measured in mgs is broadly consistent with observations .",
    "we argue that since the baryon fraction is similar to that observed in other simulated clusters  @xcite , the suppression in the mass function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] is generic to realistic baryonic treatments .",
    "in contrast to our findings , a @xmath108 per cent overabundance of clusters relative to dark matter only haloes was reported by  @xcite . in their simulations",
    "efficient radiative cooling of gas ensures the hydrodynamically simulated clusters are more concentrated than their dark matter - only counterparts and therefore have larger values of @xmath47 .",
    "we reason that the lack of agn feedback or early heating in their simulations allowed clusters to retain their baryon content and thereby allowed the mass of a given cluster to increase relative to its dark matter - only counterpart . due to the functional form of the halo mass function , a shift in mass of this nature would result in an increase in the number of clusters of a fixed mass . as argued in  @xcite , a realistic treatment of gas dynamics results in a decrease in the matter power spectrum relative to dark matter only simulations on scales @xmath109 .",
    "it therefore follows that a relative underabundance of clusters would be expected .",

    "the discrepancy we describe here is not specific to the tmf . we confirmed that using the  @xcite fit as the assumed model , instead of the tmf , produced a similar offset between the derived dark matter - only and hydrodynamic likelihood distributions .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite came to similar conclusions as presented in this work , though through different means . in that study , predictions regarding the observed mass function were made using the tmf and assuming the form of @xmath112 from  @xcite . by creating mock catalogues ,",
    "the above authors showed a systematic shift of the similar order and sense as that shown in fig  [ fig : contours ] . recently however , @xcite extended the  @xcite methodology using the @xmath113 relation derived from their set of high resolution cluster resimulations .",
    "they concluded that the mass function should be boosted by the effects of baryonic physics because , in contrast with the observational data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : baryon_fraction ] , the baryon fraction they use is higher than the cosmic mean over the mass range .",
    "our investigations differ from the above methodology in that we make no assumption regarding the functional form of the cosmic mass function or the @xmath114 relation at the run - time of our simulations .",
    "further , we have shown the @xmath85 degeneracy offset is present in two very physically distinct scenarios ( pcand fo ) .    in future _ planck _ analyses , where lower mass clusters are studied , the influence of baryonic physics on cluster masses will have to be considered and accounted for .",
    "further , our calculations are applicable to any cosmological survey with clusters of mass @xmath115 ( particularly xcs ) and provide qualitative information on what might happen at larger masses , although we leave this for future investigations .    in our final section",
    "we proposed and tested a model - independent procedure designed to recover the results of dark matter - only simulations from measurements of clusters with baryonic effects .",
    "the correction procedure was demonstrated to work well in the case where baryon - dark matter gravitational interaction was neglected ( fomodel ) .",
    "however in simulations in which baryons significantly contribute to the gravitational potential ( go / pc ) , the procedure was deemed to be insufficient .",
