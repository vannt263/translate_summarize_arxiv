    "spin chains are the most common buses where their tunable interaction has motivated researchers to use this permanently potential in the information processes @xcite .",
    "due to entanglement fragility under distance in most systems with short range interaction such as spin chains , one has to either delicately engineer the couplings @xcite or switch to super slow perturbative regimes @xcite . in all above studies symmetries of state and hamiltonian seem play the important role versus inherent entanglement for propagating information @xcite .",
    "the entanglement inherent in many - body systems has been investigated @xcite and using it for a `` known '' state transferring has been recently proposed in ref .",
