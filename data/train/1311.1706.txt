    "terzan 5 is a complex stellar system in the galactic bulge .",
    "it suffers from huge extinction , its average color excess being e@xmath0 @xcite , and it is also affected by significant differential reddening ( @xmath1e@xmath2 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "for years it has been classified as a globular cluster , although soon after its discovery its true nature was already disputed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent high resolution imaging in the near infrared ( ir ) obtained with the multi - conjugate adaptive optics demonstrator ( mad ) at eso - vlt , revealed the presence of two distinct red clumps that can not be explained by differential reddening or distance effects @xcite .",
    "prompt near infrared spectroscopy with nirspec at keck ii demonstrated that the two stellar populations are characterized by very different iron abundances ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 and + 0.3 ) .",
    "subsequent spectroscopic studies of 33 red giant stars @xcite fully confirmed the large metallicity difference between the two populations .",
    "the sub - solar component has [ fe / h]@xmath4 r.m.s . and",
    "it is @xmath5enhanced , similar to the old bulge population that likely formed at early epochs and from a gas enriched by a huge amount of type ii supernovae ( sne ) . the super - solar component , which is possibly a few gyr younger , has [ fe / h]@xmath6 and approximately solar [ @xmath7/fe ] abundance ratio , indicating that it should have originated from a gas polluted by both sne ii and ia on a longer timescale .",
    "both components show a small internal metallicity spread and the most metal - rich population is also more centrally concentrated @xcite .",
    "these observational facts could be accounted for by a proto - terzan 5 more massive in the past than today ( its current mass being @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which possibly experienced at least two relatively short episodes of star formation with a time delay of a few gyr .",
    "there is an interesting chemical similarity between terzan  5 and the bulge stellar population , which shows a metallicity distribution with two major peaks at sub - solar and super - solar [ fe / h ] and a third , minor component with significantly lower ( [ fe / h]@xmath9 ) metallicity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these bulge stellar populations show [ @xmath7/fe ] enhancement up to about solar [ fe / h ] , and then a progressive decline towards solar values at super - solar [ fe / h ] .",
    "such a trend is at variance either with the one observed in the thick disk , where the knee occurs at significantly lower values of [ fe / h ] , and with the rather flat distribution of the thin disc with about solar [ @xmath7/fe ] .",
    "chemical abundances of bulge dwarf stars from microlensing experiments ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) also suggest the presence of two populations , a sub - solar and old one with [ @xmath7/fe ] enhancement , and a possibly younger , more metal - rich one with decreasing [ @xmath7/fe ] enhancement with increasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "this letter presents the discovery of 3 red giant stars belonging to terzan  5 , with metallicity far below the sub - solar component observed so far .",
    "in the context of an ongoing spectroscopic survey with vlt - flames and keck - deimos of the terzan 5 stellar populations , aimed at constructing a massive database of radial velocities and metallicities ( massari et al . ; ferraro et al . ; 2014 in preparation ) , we found some indications of the presence of a minor ( @xmath10 ) component significantly more metal - poor than the sub - solar population of terzan  5 .",
    "we acquired high resolution spectra of 3 radial velocity candidate metal - poor giants members of terzan  5 .",
    "observations using nirspec @xcite at keck ii were undertaken on 17 june 2013 .",
    "we used the nirspec-5 setting to enable observations in the @xmath11-band and a @xmath12 slit width that provides an overall spectral resolution r=25,000 .",
    "data reduction has been performed by using the redspec idl - based package developed at the ucla ir laboratory .",
    "each spectrum has been sky subtracted by using nod pairs , corrected for flat - field and calibrated in wavelength using arc lamps .",
    "an o - star spectrum observed during the same night has been used to remove to check and remove telluric features .",
    "the signal to noise ratio iper rersolution element of the final spectra is always @xmath1330 .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows portions of the observed spectra and the comparison with a terzan  5 giant with similar stellar parameters and higher iron content from the sub - solar population studied by @xcite .",
    "we compare the observed spectra with synthetic ones and we obtain accurate chemical abundances of c and o using molecular lines and of fe , ca , si , mg , ti and al using neutral atomic lines , as also described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we made use of both spectral synthesis analysis and equivalent width measurements of isolated lines .",
    "synthetic spectra covering a wide range of stellar parameters and elemental abundances have been computed by using the same code as in @xcite and described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the code uses the lte approximation , the molecular blanketed model atmospheres of @xcite at temperatures @xmath144000  k , and the @xcite abundances for the solar reference .",
    "stellar temperatures have been first estimated from colors , by using the reddening estimates by @xcite and the color - temperature scale by @xcite , calibrated on globular cluster giants .",
    "gravity has been estimated from theoretical isochrones @xcite , according to the position of the stars on the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "an average microturbulence velocity of 2 km / s has been adopted ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the simultaneous spectral fitting of the co and oh molecular lines that are especially sensitive to temperature , gravity and microturbulence variations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allow us to fine - tune our best - fit adopted stellar parameters .",
    "our provisional estimate for the systemic velocity of terzan  5 , as inferred from our vlt - flames and keck - deimos survey , is 82 km / s with a velocity dispersion of @xmath1515  km / s .    from the nirspec spectra we first measured the radial velocity of the 3 stars under study and confirm values within @xmath16 from the systemic velocity of terzan  5 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "these stars are located in the central region of terzan  5 , at distances between 13 and 71 arcsec from the center ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "our vlt - flames and keck - deimos survey shows that in this central region the contamination by field stars with similar radial velocities and metallicity is negligible ( well below 1% ) .",
    "preliminary analysis of proper motions also indicates that these stars are likely members of terzan  5 .",
    "we then measured the chemical abundances of iron , alpha - elements , carbon and aluminum .",
    "our best - fit estimates of the stellar temperature and gravity , radial velocity and chemical abundances with @xmath17 random errors are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . in the evaluation of the overall error budget",
    "we also estimate that systematics due to @xmath18200  k , @xmath190.5 dex , @xmath200.5 km / s variations in the adopted stellar parameters can affect the inferred abundances by @xmath21 dex . however , the derived abundance ratios are less dependent on the systematic error , since most of the spectral features used to measure abundance ratios have similar trends with varying the stellar parameters , and at least some degeneracy between abundance and the latter is canceled out .",
    "we find the average iron abundance [ fe / h]=0.79@xmath220.04 r.m.s . to be significantly lower ( by a factor of @xmath23 ) than the value of the sub - solar population ( [ fe / h]@xmath24 ) , pointing towards the presence of a distinct population in terzan  5 , rather than to the low metallicity tail of the sub - solar component .",
    "as shown in figure  [ alpha ] , our newly discovered metal - poor population has an average @xmath7-enhancement ( [ @xmath7/fe]@xmath25 r.m.s . )",
    "similar to that of the sub - solar one , indicating that both populations likely formed early and on short timescales from a gas polluted by type ii sne .    as the stars belonging to the sub - solar component , also these other giants with low iron content show an enhanced [ al / fe ] abundance ratio ( average [ al / fe]@xmath26 r.m.s . ) and no evidence of al - mg and al - o anti - correlations , and/or large [ o / fe ] and [ al / fe ] scatters , although no firm conclusion can be drawn with 3 stars only .",
    "we also measured some [ c / fe ] depletion ( at least in stars # 243 and # 262 ) , as commonly found in giant stars and explained with mixing processes in the stellar interiors during the evolution along the rgb .",
    "new spectroscopic observations of 3 stars , members of terzan  5 , have provided a further evidence of the complex nature of this stellar system and of its likely connection with the bulge formation and evolution history .",
    "we find that terzan  5 hosts a third , metal - poorer population with average [ fe / h]=@xmath27 r.m.s . and [ @xmath7/fe ] enhancement . from our vlt - flames",
    "/ keck - deimos survey , we estimate that this component represents a minor fraction ( a few percent ) of the stellar populations in terzan  5 .",
    "notably , a similar fraction ( @xmath28 ) of metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath29 ) has been also detected in the bulge ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this metal - poor population shows a kinematics typical of a slowly rotating spheroidal or a metal weak thick disk component .",
    "our discovery significantly enlarges the metallicity range covered by terzan  5 , which amounts to @xmath30[fe / h]@xmath31 dex .",
    "such a value is completely unexpected and unobserved in genuine globular clusters .",
    "indeed , within the galaxy only another globular - like system , namely @xmath32centauri , harbors stellar populations with a large ( @xmath131  dex ) spread in iron @xcite .",
    "this evidence strongly sets terzan 5 and @xmath32centauri apart from the class of genuine globular clusters , and suggests a more complex formation and evolutionary history for these two multi - iron systems .",
    "it is also interesting to note that detailed spectroscopic screening recently performed in @xmath32centauri revealed an additional sub - component significantly more metal - poor ( by @xmath30[fe / h]@xmath33 dex ) than the dominant population @xcite .",
    "the authors suggest that this is best accounted for in a self - enrichment scenario , where these stars could be the remnants of the fist stellar generation in @xmath32centauri .",
    "the three populations of terzan  5 may also be explained with some self - enrichment .",
    "the narrow peaks in their metallicity distribution can be the result of a quite bursty star formation activity in the proto - terzan  5 , which should have been much more massive in the past to retain the sn ejecta and progressively enrich in metals its gas",
    ". however , terzan  5 might also be the result of an early merging of fragments with sub - solar metallicity at the epoch of the bulge / bar formation , and with younger and more metal - rich sub - structures following subsequent interactions with the central disk .    however , apart from the similarity in terms of large iron range and possible self - enrichment , @xmath32centauri and terzan 5 likely had quite different origins and evolution .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that @xmath32centauri can be the remnant of a dwarf galaxy accreted from outside the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at variance , the much higher metallicity of terzan  5 and its chemical similarity to the bulge populations suggests some _ symbiotic _ evolution between these two stellar systems .",
