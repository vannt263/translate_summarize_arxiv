    "the thermal - viscous accretion - disc instability model is more than 15 years old ( see cannizzo for a historical overview ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that it provides the correct description of dwarf - nova outbursts and of ( ` soft ' ) x - ray transient events .",
    "when , however , observations of these systems are compared with predictions of the model , the agreement is far from perfect ( e.g. lasota & hameury and references therein ) .",
    "it is sometimes also unclear what the predictions of the model are .",
    "one of the reasons for these uncertainties is the existence of various , different , versions of the model . from the very beginning these versions of the disc instability model differed in assumptions about viscosity and boundary conditions ; they differed in the amount of matter accreted during the outburst , the shapes of light - curves , etc .",
    "( see cannizzo ) . at that time these differences seemed to be less important than the differences between the disc instability model and the competing , mass - transfer instability model @xcite .",
    "the exponentially decaying tails of theoretical light curves predicted by the mass - transfer model were thought to contradict observations @xcite and the outer disc radius behaviour during and after outbursts seemed to favour the disc instability model @xcite .",
    "the demise of the mass - transfer instability model was , however , caused by the lack of a physical mechanism which would trigger it .",
    "with one model left it became important to establish just what its predictions are , and not merely whether it is better ( or worse ) than the competing model @xcite .",
    "the first systematic study of the disc instability model was presented by cannizzo , who analysed the importance of various terms in the disc evolution equations and the influence of the numerical grid resolution on the outburst properties .",
    "ludwig , meyer - hofmeister & ritter studied general properties of disc outbursts , such as the location of the instability that triggers them .",
    "recently ludwig & meyer analysed non - keplerian effects which may arise during front propagation .",
    "the general conclusions of this group of studies were that non - keplerian effects are negligible , that a few hundred grid points provide a sufficient resolution for the calculation results to be independent of the number of grid points , and , finally , that with the usual assumption ( see smak ( 1984b ) of a jump in the value of the viscosity parameter @xmath0 , the model produces only ` inside - out ' outbursts , i.e. outbursts starting in the inner disc regions .",
    "this last conclusion , if true , would entail changing the standard viscosity law ( in which the @xmath0 parameter is constant in the hot and cool branch of the @xmath1 - @xmath2 curve ) because outburts starting in the outer disc regions are clearly observed in classical dwarf - nova system ss cyg @xcite .",
    "this law already had to be modified when it was found @xcite that in order to get lightcurves similar to those observed in dwarf novae , @xmath0 in outburst had to be larger than @xmath0 in quiescence .",
    "the absence of ` outside - in ' outbursts in these studies , however , is just the result of keeping the outer disc radius constant in the calculations ( section 4.1 ) @xcite ; from this point of view , there is no reason to modify the viscosity prescription .",
    "this does not in itself prove that changes in viscosity are correctly described by the bimodal behaviour of the @xmath0-parameter ( see e.g. gammie & menou 1998 ) , but the reasons given for preferring other versions ( the exponential decay from outburst being the principal one ) are not compelling , and these versions involve more fundamental changes in the disc physics ( see lasota & hameury 1998 for discussion and references ) .",
    "for example , cannizzo , chen & livio use the formula @xmath3 , but to make the model work they have to ` switch off ' convection .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to recall that faulkner , lin & papaloizou ( 1983 ) found dwarf nova outburst with @xmath0 constant , but their model was criticized @xcite because they claimed that convection has only a minor influence on the energy transport in the disc .",
    "these are not formal problems because the constant @xmath0 models predict optically thin quiescent discs , whereas in bimodal @xmath0 models the quiescent disc is optically thick .",
    "there is observational evidence that dwarf nova discs in quiescence are optically thin ( see horne , 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "conclusions about the number of grid points required to get resolution - invariant results seem , on inspection , too optimistic , especially because fronts are not resolved , a point which is particularily worrying for the heating fronts .",
    "the present situation of the disc instability model seems to be confused .",
    "various versions are based on different assumptions about the physical processes in the disc and numerical codes suffer either from incorrect boundary conditions or from insufficient resolution or from both .",
    "quite often , in the case of explicit codes the resolution is limited by the required computer time .    in this article",
    "we describe a numerical model of time - dependent accretion discs , using an adaptive grid technique and an implicit numerical scheme , in which the disc size is allowed to vary with time .",
    "this numerical scheme allows rapid calculations of disc outburst cycles at very high resolution .",
    "these properties allow an easy comparison with other versions of the model and a systematic study of its various assumptions .    in the near future",
    "we will use our code to model various properties of dwarf novae and x - ray transients .",
    "the model was alread used to model properties and outbursts of the dwarf - nova wz sge @xcite and the rise to outburst of the x - ray transient gro j1655 - 40 @xcite .    in  2",
    "we discuss the time - dependent equations describing the disc radial structure and the implicit method used to solve them with a high spatial resolution .",
    "the vertical structure of the disc , and hence the heating and cooling terms that enter the time - dependent energy equation , are considered in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present the results of our calculations and we discuss the importance of having sufficient numerical resolution and a correct boundary condition at the outer edge of the disc .",
    "the basic equations for mass and angular momentum conservation in a geometrically thin accretion disc can be written as : @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath1 is the surface column density , @xmath6 is the rate at which mass is incorporated into the disc at point @xmath7 , @xmath8 the radial velocity in the disc , @xmath9 is the specific angular momentum of material at radius @xmath7 in the disc , @xmath10 is the keplerian angular velocity ( @xmath11 being the mass of the accreting object ) , @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient , and @xmath13 the specific angular momentum of the material transfered from the secondary . @xmath14 is the torque due to tidal forces , for which we use the value of smak , derived from the determination of tidal torques by papaloizou & pringle ): @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the angular velocity of the binary orbital motion , @xmath17 is a numerical coefficient taken so as to give a stationary ( or time averaged ) disc radius equal to some chosen value , and @xmath18 is the binary orbital separation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : consj ] ) is the standard form of angular momentum conservation , in which it is assumed that the azimuthal velocity @xmath19 has the keplerian value @xmath20 .",
    "ludwig & meyer have considered deviations from keplerian motion arising from strong pressure gradients ( i.e. in the heating and cooling fronts ) and found that these deviations only have a marginal influence on the outburst behaviour .",
    "the energy conservation equation is taken as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the surface heating and cooling rates respectively .",
    "they are usually taken as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath2 being the effective temperature ( e.g. cannizzo ) .",
    "as described in  3 we use slightly different forms of these rates .",
    "the term @xmath26 accounts for the radial energy flux carried either by viscous processes or by radiation . in the following ,",
    "we neglect the radiative flux which , according to ludwig & meyer , is negligible , while according to cannizzo it is comparable to the viscous radial flux .",
    "if viscosity is due to turbulence , @xmath26 can be estimated in the framework of the @xmath0 parametrization .",
    "the flux carried in eddies with characteristic velocity @xmath27 and size @xmath28 , is : @xmath29 in which case @xmath30 a similar expression is obtained for radiative transport .",
    "note that this expression differs slightly from that used by cannizzo which can not be written as the divergence of a flux . other prescriptions for @xmath26 exist , in time - dependent simulations ; they give results very similar to those obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fturb ] ) .",
    "so far there is no clear understanding of the physics of the interaction between the disc and the stream ( see e.g. armitage & livio , 1997 ) , and a fraction of the stream may spill over the disc .",
    "a proper treatment of the precise way in which matter is incorporated into the disc is far beyond our scope , and we use here the simplest , but very reasonable assumption that mass addition at the outer edge of the disc occurs in a very narrow region , so that the disc edge is very sharply defined .",
    "we can then write @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the mass transfer rate from the secondary star , @xmath34 is the heavyside function , @xmath35 is the dirac function and @xmath36 , the surface column density , is a smoothly varying function .",
    "the cancelation of the @xmath35 terms in the equation for mass and angular momentum conservation yields two boundary conditions , which can be written in the form : @xmath37 and @xmath38 = 3 \\pi \\nu \\sigma_0 , \\label{eq : bc2}\\ ] ] where the index 0 denotes quantities measured at the outer edge , and @xmath39 is the circularization radius , i.e. the radius at which the keplerian angular momentum is that of the matter lost by the secondary star , and @xmath40 is the time derivative of the outer disc radius .",
    "it is worth noting that the presence of a torque @xmath14 is required in this formulation , and it can be easily seen that no steady solutions exist when @xmath41 .",
    "conditions ( [ eq : bc1 ] , [ eq : bc2 ] ) take into account the fact that the outer edge of the disc can vary with time , and its position is controlled by the the tidal torque @xmath14 .",
    "variations of the disc radius are observed during outburst cycles in dwarf novae @xcite , with a rapid rise during the outburst and a decrease of the order of 20 percent during decline ; such variations have been considered as a strong argument in favour of the disc instability model for dwarf novae , as opposed to the mass transfer instability model .",
    "the presence of ` superhumps ' during su uma s superoutbursts is explained by the disc radius becoming larger than the radius for the 3:1 resonance ( see e.g frank , king & raine ) .",
    "osaki assumes that the superoutbursts themselves are due to a ` tidal - thermal instability ' which sets in when the disc s outer radius reaches the 3:1 resonance zone ; see however smak .",
    "nevertheless it is often assumed , when modeling the normal outbursts , that the outer edge of the disc is fixed at a given radius , in which case eq .  ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) is used with @xmath42 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath43 ; the tidal torque @xmath14 is also neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : consj ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that @xmath14 is negligible at @xmath44 and becomes infinite at @xmath43 . in view of the steep functional dependence of @xmath45 , this might seem a reasonable approximation ; however , we shall show that this is not the case at all , and that results obtained with both boundary conditions differ very significantly .",
    "an intermediate formulation has been proposed by mineshige & osaki , who assume that the viscous stresses vanish at a fixed outer radius .",
    "this enables matter carrying angular momentum to leave the disc at its outer edge , at a rate which is comparable to the mass transfer rate .",
    "we take , as usual , @xmath46 at the inner edge of the disc ( more exactly , @xmath1 equal to a small value ) .    the thermal equation",
    "being a second order partial differential equation in @xmath7 , two boundary conditions are required . however , except across a transition front between a hot and a cool region , the dominant terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat ] ) are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the highest order terms in the thermal equation are therefore negligible in almost all of the disc ; the solutions of such equations are known to develop boundary layers , which adapt the internal solution ( in which the highest order terms are neglected ) to the boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions are thus of no physical importance , and should be such as to minimize numerical difficulties .",
    "we have here taken @xmath47 at both edges of the disc .",
    "we solve the set of equations ( [ eq : consm ] , [ eq : consj ] , [ eq : heat ] ) using a method described by eggleton .",
    "this method , which uses a variable mesh size , is a generalization of the henyey method @xcite , designed to solve the set of non - linear equations describing the internal structure of stars .",
    "the solutions of these equations have steep gradients , both at their surface and in the vicinity of the thin burning shells which appear after their evolution off the main sequence ; moreover , the position of the shells is not fixed , but may vary relatively rapidly across the stellar envelope .",
    "the natural abscissa , @xmath7 in our case , is considered as an unknown variable of a new parameter @xmath48 in the range 0  1 over the grid .",
    "the variable @xmath7 varies according to : @xmath49    where w is a function which becomes small when the radial derivatives of @xmath50 or @xmath1 become large , and @xmath51 is a normalization constant which adjusts the grid to the physical range covered by the variable @xmath7 , so that @xmath52 here , we take @xmath53 ^ 2 + 0.1 \\left [ { \\partial \\ln t_{\\rm c } \\over \\partial \\ln r}\\right]^2.\\ ] ] the thermal and viscous equations ( [ eq : consm ] , [ eq : consj ] , [ eq : heat ] ) are equivalent to a set of four first order differential equations . these equations plus the two equations ( [ eq : griddef ] , [ eq : phiconst ] ) defining the grid are discretized and solved using a generalized newton method . they can be written in the form : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of equations , the @xmath56 are the 6 variables @xmath7 , @xmath51 , @xmath50 , @xmath1 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the @xmath59 terms contain the time - derivatives .",
    "the discretized equation takes the form : @xmath60 = 0 , \\label{eq : discr}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the mesh size , @xmath62 is the value of the quantity @xmath56 at the grid point @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , and the @xmath65 are weights in the range @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "values of @xmath65 equal to 0.5 lead to a second order scheme .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : discr ] ) is linearized ( including eq .",
    "( [ eq : griddef]-[eq : phiconst ] ) by numerical differentiation .",
    "this method has the advantage of being fully implicit , but convergence may be a problem when the initial guess is not close enough to the actual solution .",
    "whereas in eggleton the time derivatives are expressed in their eulerian form , we directly estimate the lagrangean values by using either a linear or a cubic spline interpolation of the quantities calculated at the previous timestep , on the previous grid .",
    "the latter is more accurate , but requires a higher number of points when a transition front is present in the disc in order to avoid numerical oscillations .",
    "this formulation does not guarantee that the disc mass is a conserved quantity within roundoff errors .",
    "instead , the disc mass has to be explicitly calculated by integrating @xmath1 over the disc extension , and deviations from mass conservation ( easy to calculate given the inner and outer mass accretion rates in the disc , together with the time step of integration ) provide valuable information on the quality of the code .",
    "we checked that all adaptive grid models presented here do indeed conserve mass accurately , except when we use too small a number of grid points ( typically 100 or less ) . in the latter case ,",
    "convergence is often a problem .    in order to improve the stability of the numerical scheme ,",
    "we have used values of @xmath65 equal to 0 for the two equations defining the derivatives of @xmath50 and @xmath1 , and to 1 for the two equations defining their second derivatives when the radius of the outer edge of the disc is kept fixed ; we have also calculated the lagrangean derivatives using linear interpolations . however , when @xmath67 is allowed to vary , mass conservation is more difficult to enforce ; we have taken all @xmath65 equal to 0.5 in that case , and used cubic splines to calculate the time derivatives .",
    "the timestep is chosen on empirical grounds and depends on the quality of the previous convergence .",
    "we find that initiating the disc with a hot steady solution or a globally cold state with an arbitrary @xmath1 profile gives , after a short transient period , equivalent results .",
    "the vertical structure equations are very similar to those describing the internal structure of a star , with the notable exception that energy is dissipated everywhere in the vertical structure , including the optically thin regions , and that the vertical gravity comes from the central object .    in order to follow the time evolution of accretion discs",
    ", one needs to know the thermal imbalance ( @xmath68 ) as a function of the central temperature @xmath50 and the surface column density @xmath1 at any radius in the disc .",
    "one should then be able to solve the full 2d energy transfer problem , which , in the thin disc approximation , is assumed to decouple into radial ( eq .  ( [ eq : heat ] ) ) and vertical equations .",
    "the latter , together with the reasonable assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , are as follows @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the pressure , density and temperature respectively , @xmath73 is the surface column density between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 the vertical component of gravity , @xmath77 the vertical energy flux and @xmath78 the temperature gradient of the structure .",
    "this is generally radiative , with @xmath79 , given by : @xmath80 @xmath81 being the radiative pressure . when the radiative gradient is superadiabatic , @xmath78 is convective ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the convective gradient is calculated in the mixing length approximation , with a mixing length taken as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the pressure scale height : @xmath85 which ensures that @xmath84 is smaller than the vertical scale height of the disc .",
    "we have @xcite : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the adiabatic gradient , and @xmath34 is the solution of the cubic equation : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the optical depth of the convective eddies . the coefficient @xmath90 is given by : @xmath91 here we take @xmath92 , which is appropriate for solar type stars ( @xmath93 ranges from 1 to 2 in solar models , see e.g. guzik & lebreton and demarque and guenther ) .",
    "one should note that @xmath94 is generally used in the literature ; as the disc vertical structure depends on the assumed @xmath93 @xcite , we expect some difference from previous results .",
    "@xmath95 is a time - dependent contribution that includes terms resulting from heating / cooling and contraction / expansion .",
    "this contribution is basically unknown , but it is most often assumed as proportional to @xmath70 ; if this is the case , then eq .  ( [ eq : strc ] ) can be replaced by : @xmath96 where @xmath97 may be considered as some effective viscosity .",
    "this coefficient is not known _ a priori _ and is generally different from the true viscosity parameter ; the difference @xmath98 measures the departure from thermal equilibrium . the vertical structure , and hence the disc effective temperature at any given point , can therefore be obtained assuming that the disc is in thermal equilibrium , but with some unspecified @xmath97 different from @xmath0 .    even though this approximation is not unreasonable , and can be shown to be valid in the simplest case , that of a perfect gas and homologous cooling and contraction @xcite , it is by no means justified and constitutes a significant drawback to the model .",
    "other approximations have been used in the past ; it is for example possible to assume that @xmath77 has a given vertical profile ; this is the approach of mineshige & osaki who assumed that @xmath77 increases linearly with altitude up to a saturation value .",
    "this is not drastically different from assuming that @xmath99 is proportional to pressure , since in both cases , energy is released in the densest regions of the disc , i.e. within one or a few scale heights from the mid plane .",
    "we have compared the results given in both cases , and we found that , for a given @xmath100 ) , @xmath50 being the central temperature , the effective temperatures obtained agreed to within 5 to 10 % .",
    "therefore , the cooling fluxes in time - dependent accretion discs are not determined better than to within 50%",
    ".    it would be highly desirable to have a better determination of @xmath23 ; however , this would require at least the introduction of explicitly time - dependent terms in the vertical structure equations , and that would couple the radial and vertical structure of the disc .",
    "this would enormously increase the required amount of computing time , making it very difficult to follow a complete outburst cycle with a reasonable number of radial grid points .",
    "the viscous dissipation term @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : strc ] ) is a direct consequence of the assumption that the radial - azimuthal component of the viscous stress tensor can be written @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "one should also note that the @xmath0 prescription is used here in its local version , i.e. the local energy dissipation is assumed to be proportional to the pressure , which is by no means obvious .",
    "our approach is to determine @xmath23 for a number of values of @xmath50 , @xmath1 , and @xmath7 and then perform a linear interpolation . in what follows ,",
    "we have taken 70 equally logarithmically spaced values for @xmath7 ( 190 , 120 for @xmath50 , @xmath1 respectively ) .",
    "this may seem time - consuming , but once the initial grid has been calculated , it is much more precise than the approach in which a sparse grid is used to construct analytic fits of @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath103 `` s - curves '' are found numerically by looking in the grid for values of @xmath1 , @xmath50 , @xmath0 and @xmath7 which satisfy the thermal equilibrium condition .    in thermal equilibrium",
    "the heating term @xmath22 is given by : @xmath104 which is close , but not exactly equal , to the heating term @xmath105 generally used in the literature .",
    "setting @xmath106 , and assuming that @xmath107 is constant , one recovers the classical expression .",
    "this slight difference might appear as a minor inconsistency , but it may lead to unwanted numerical effects , since the equilibrium situation found when solving the radial structure would be different from that found in this section , and the disc may become unstable for a surface density slightly different from the expected critical value . for this reason , we prefer to use the exact value of the integral in ( [ eq : qplus ] ) rather than its approximation ; it is stored and interpolated in order to provide an accurate @xmath22 to the time - dependent runs .",
    "we solved the vertical structure equations in two different approximations for the radiative transfer of energy , namely in the optically thick approximation and in the grey atmosphere approximation .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : stra]-[eq : strb ] , [ eq : strcc ] ) is integrated between the disc midplane and the photosphere , defined as the point where : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "the other boundary conditions are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 at the disc midplane , and @xmath114 , @xmath115 at the photosphere .      for low values of the surface column density , the disc optical depth is no longer large .",
    "an accurate solution of the vertical disc structure would require an excessive amount of computing time , since frequency - dependent opacities would have to be taken into account for consistency .",
    "instead , we chose to integrate the set of equations ( [ eq : stra][eq : strd ] ) down to optically thin regions , but we use a grey atmosphere approximation in which the temperature varies as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the surface temperature and @xmath118 the optical depth , given by : @xmath119 for optical depths larger than unity , one should use rosseland opacities @xmath109 , whereas at small optical depths , the planck mean opacities @xmath120 are relevant . here",
    "we take @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the estimated disc optical depth .",
    "this @xmath123 relation leads to the following boundary condition at the surface : @xmath124 d \\tau,\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the exponential - integral function .",
    "this relation can be approximated to better than @xmath126 by @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the optical depth from the midplane to the surface .",
    "the grey atmosphere approximation is rather crude ( see e.g. shaviv & wehrse 1991 ; hubeny 1990 ) ; moreover , it does not account for energy deposition in optically thin layers .",
    "however , calculations of the vertical disc structure using the shaviv & wehrse ( 1991 ) radiative transfer code show that the grey approximation is quite good , especially in view of uncertainties in @xmath23 mentioned above @xcite . in any case , the grey atmosphere approximation is required if one is willing to calculate a large number of such disc structures in a reasonable amount of computing time .    the two photospheric boundary conditions ( [ eq : phote ] ) and @xmath129 are replaced by ( [ eq : photm ] ) and @xmath71 vanishingly small ( we take here @xmath130 g @xmath131 ) .",
    "the optical depth has to be explicitly integrated in the vertical structure .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ eq : deftau ] ) is added to the set of equations that we solve , with the associated boundary condition @xmath132 at the disc surface .",
    "we solve the set of equations ( [ eq : stra][eq : strc ] ) for given values of the surface density @xmath1 and central temperature @xmath50 using the same adaptive grid numerical method as for the disc equations .",
    "the grid is now defined by : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the vertical scale height of the disc .    because we have to solve the vertical structure for any given @xmath50 and @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath97 is not known _ a priori _ , but is a function of @xmath50 and @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , there is one more boundary condition than the number of differential equations , but one parameter is unknown .",
    "this can be formulated in a more classical problem by introducing a new equation : @xmath135 we solve a set of 7 equations ( [ eq : stra][eq : strc ] , [ eq : griddef ] , [ eq : phiconst ] , [ eq : alfconst ] ) with 7 boundary conditions in the optically thick approximation , while eq .",

    "the typical surface density and central temperature radial profiles that we observe in our simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profhc ] . during the inward propagation of the cooling fronts ,",
    "we recognize the density rarefaction wave that precedes the region of rapid cooling , while during the propagation of the heating fronts , we observe the density spike associated with the sharp region of rapid heating @xcite .",
    "we also note that our light curves are periodic ( except when the number of points is so small that numerical errors are large ) .",
    "we now take the same basic parameters as those used by cannizzo in his attempt to reproduce the light curve of ss cyg .",
    "we take @xmath168 , @xmath169 ; the mass transfer from the secondary is @xmath170 = 10@xmath171 @xmath172 , and the mass of the accreting white dwarf is @xmath11 = 1.2 m@xmath159 with an inner disc radius @xmath173 cm .",
    "we use the optically thick approximation for determining the cooling function @xmath23 of the disc .",
    "our reference model uses 800 grid points .",
    "it is worth noting that , because we do not use exactly the same cooling function ( our values of @xmath138 and @xmath137 differ by approximately 10 percent , and we do not use the same interpolation procedure between the cold and the hot branches of the s - curves , where @xmath0 varies from @xmath149 to @xmath150 ) , we do not expect to obtain quite the same result as cannizzo ; in particular , our model parameters have not been adjusted to fit ss cyg s observed light curves .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp_bc ] shows the two light curves obtained when the outer disc radius is fixed at @xmath174 cm , and when @xmath175 is allowed to vary , the constant @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deft ] ) being such that the average value of @xmath163 is also @xmath176 cm .    in the first case",
    ", we do reproduce the results of cannizzo qualitatively : we have an alternative sequence of short and long outbursts , which are all of the inside - out type .",
    "there are some quantitative differences , which can be attributed to the differences mentioned above , but the overall aspect is similar . in the second case , we obtain totally different results which , not surprisingly , are similar to those of ichikawa & osaki .",
    "we still obtain an alternating sequence of long and short outbursts , but both the number of short outbursts and the cycle length are quite different . as a rule , it is much easier to obtain such a sequence of alternating short and long outbursts when the outer radius is fixed than when it is allowed to vary .",
    "when the outer edge of the disc is kept fixed at a constant value , we always observe inside - out outbursts , as did cannizzo , ludwig et al . and",
    "ludwig & meyer .",
    "this is in contradiction with observations which show that , in a number of cases , the instability is triggered in the outer parts of the disc .",
    "such a discrepancy has been attributed by ludwig et al . to the fact that the disc might not extend to the white dwarf surface ( note that this by itself would not suffice to give outside - in outbursts , since the instability would still be triggered in the innermost parts of the disc , but it could account for the uv delay ) .",
    "they also argued that the viscosity law could be more complex that the simple bimodal @xmath0 prescription .",
    "however , when @xmath175 is allowed to vary , we obtain outside - in outbursts for mass transfer rates high enough for the accumulation time of matter in the outer disc regions to be shorter than the viscous diffusion time .    the qualitative difference observed between the two cases",
    "is due to the fact that a much larger fraction of the disc is accreted during ( large ) outbursts when one assumes that @xmath163 is constant : the density spike associated with the heating front brings some material to the outer edge of the disc , which splashes on the rigid wall implied by the boundary condition , and thus strongly increases @xmath1 ; this matter will eventually be accreted until the cooling wave starts , when @xmath177 at the outer edge of the disc ; the accompanying rarefaction wave actually brings @xmath1 below that value .",
    "the real situation is however quite different : when the density spike reaches the disc outer edge , @xmath163 increases ( matter carrying a large quantity of angular momentum flows outward ) , and the spike finally dies out .",
    "thus the cooling wave starts earlier , at a stage where less mass from the outer disc has been accreted ; moreover , during the quiescent phase , the disc contracts ( the outward angular momentum flux is reduced ) , while mass transfer from the secondary continues .",
    "both effects contribute to increase @xmath1 in the outer disc and help the occurrence of outside - in outbursts .",
    "the use of adaptive grids is an important improvement on previous time - dependent disc models in that the transition fronts are always resolved , whatever their location in the disc .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : profkr ] where we show the sharpness of a heating front and contrast it with the actual width `` seen '' by the adaptive grid .",
    "a fair fraction of the grid ( @xmath178 100 of the total 800 grid points in our reference model - adp800 ) is devoted to the front as a region of strong gradients .",
    "note that the inner edge of the disc is also resolved by the grid .",
    "we now evaluate the effect that degrading the numerical resolution has on the predicted light curves and on the variations of the total disc mass .",
    "we compare the relative merits of our code in an adaptive grid version and various fixed grid versions that we obtain when the grid function @xmath179 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : griddef ] ) is defined as a function of @xmath7 only . in all cases ,",
    "the outer radius has not been allowed to vary .",
    "we tested r , log and sqr grids ( defined by a linear , a logarithmic and a square root spacing between grid points , respectively ) , but we concentrate here only on the results in the sqr grid case because this type of grid has been used extensively in the literature .",
    "indeed , the viscous equation has a particularly simple form when the variables @xmath180 and @xmath181 are used @xcite .",
    "we report in table  [ tab : prevgrid ] a few examples of grids and resolutions that have been used in time - dependent studies so far .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : prevgrid ]    we investigate the fixed sqr and adaptive grids at resolutions @xmath182 and we refer to these models as adp100 to adp1600 and sqr100 to sqr1600 .",
    "figures  [ fig : mvadp ] to [ fig : mdiskcomb ] show the time evolution of the v magnitude and the total disc mass in these models .",
    "a straightforward conclusion is that a high numerical resolution ( @xmath183 ) is required to reach a regime where the general shape of the outbursts becomes independent of the resolution .",
    "this is particularly true for the small outbursts , because the general aspect of the large ones is obtained at a relatively moderate resolution .",
    "the adaptive grid naturally requires a smaller number of grid points than the fixed grid to reach this regime ( typically 200  400 points , compared with 800 points for the fixed grid ) .",
    "it is worth noting that most results in the literature have been obtained with resolutions which do not seem sufficient to avoid the resolution limits ( see table  [ tab : prevgrid ] ) .",
    "the inadequacy of such a treatment is partially hidden by the fact that ( 1 ) the viscosity is a free parameter which can be determined only by confronting the time - dependent disc models with the observations , and ( 2 ) the cooling term @xmath23 that enters the thermal equation is not well known , and varies somewhat from one author to another .",
    "these two facts may account for two differences that we have with cannizzo s results , even when we take his assumptions , parameters and number of grid points .",
    "our small outbursts have peak amplitudes significantly smaller than the large outburst peak amplitudes .",
    "we also find that the evolution of the disc mass is almost independent on the resolution of the fixed sqr grid , in the sense that @xmath184 % of that mass is invariably accreted during large outbursts , whatever the resolution .      until recently ,",
    "numerical simulations were not able to resolve the structure of the transition fronts .",
    "for that reason , it has been very difficult to compare the predictions of semi - analytical models with the numerical results , and the physics of the fronts is not yet understood in much detail @xcite .",
    "we leave this comparison for a future paper , and here instead we determine the numerical resolution required to address this problem properly .",
    "a heating or cooling front which is not numerically resolved will be artificially enlarged ; the physical results obtained in these conditions are very questionable . in the extreme case",
    "where a gradient ( like a front ) is limited to one numerical cell ( between two grid points ) , the fluxes across the gradient are likely to be reduced and more of a numerical than a physical nature .",
    "once again , one should keep in mind that uncertainties in the thermal equation ( [ eq : heat ] ) , and in particular in the radial flux @xmath26 , may well hide resolution effects .",
    "for instance , cannizzo shows that the light curves of dwarf novae do depend on the precise form of the thermal equation .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dw ] the fractional width , @xmath185 , of the heating and cooling fronts during several outburst cycles of our test models .",
    "note that @xmath186 is the width over which @xmath187  % of the variation of @xmath0 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) ) occurs .",
    "this should not to be taken as a definitive value for the front width , but rather as a typical width ( affected by resolution effects as well ) .",
    "what appears clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : dw ] is that fixed sqr grids do not resolve transition fronts well enough in the inner parts of the disc , even at high resolution .",
    "the discontinuities seen in the sqr model widths are signatures of the resolution limits and are very significant at low resolution ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the situation is systematically worse for heating fronts , which are sharper than cooling fronts .",
    "the adaptive grid has been devised to avoid large temperature and density differences between two grid points , and predicts the correct width for a moderate number of grid points @xmath189 .",
    "we also note that even when , close to the wd , the front widths are limited by the resolution , the resulting light curves may still be correct ( sqr800 - 1600 ) .",
    "the basic reason is that the general outburst shape is not affected by what happens close to the compact object , where all characteristic timescales are small . on the other hand",
    ", an adaptive grid may approximately resolve the heating and cooling fronts , but produce incorrect results at low resolution ( for example when @xmath190 ) .",
    "this is a result of too many grid points being used in steep gradient regions , which leaves too small a number of grid points in most parts of the disc .",
    "-1truecm      we define the fractional inter - grid spacing ( hereafter fis ) between two grid points ( @xmath63 and @xmath191 ) as : @xmath192 where the index @xmath63 refers to the grid point of interest in the grid extended from @xmath193 at the inner edge of the disc to @xmath194 at the outer edge of the discs .",
    "a fixed @xmath7 grid is defined by : @xmath195 @xmath35 being a constant depending on the resolution @xmath189 used . in this case , the fis is @xmath196 a fixed sqr grid is defined by : @xmath197 and the corresponding fis is @xmath198 a log grid is defined by : @xmath199 the corresponding fis is @xmath200    the adaptive grid runs show that the heating fronts reach a fractional width as low as @xmath201 , and that @xmath185 is @xmath202 for the cooling fronts at the inner edge of the disc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dw ] ) .",
    "this means that fiss of the order of ( @xmath203 , @xmath204)/(@xmath205 , @xmath206 ) are required if a grid is to resolve the cooling and heating fronts with @xmath207/@xmath208 grid points respectively .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gridresol ] the fiss for the r , sqr and log grids as a function of the numerical resolution @xmath189 , and we compare them to the fiss required to resolve the cooling and heating fronts with @xmath207 and @xmath208 points .",
    "the comparison is performed at the inner edge of the disc ( @xmath193 ) since fronts resolved there will be resolved everywhere in the disc : the front fractional widths increase with radius while the fiss of fixed grids are either constant ( log grid ) or decrease with radius ( r and sqr grids ) .",
    "the fixed grids require very high numerical resolutions to resolve in detail the fronts everywhere in the disc ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "the situation is worse when the accreting object is a black hole or a neutron star : the r and sqr grids will resolve the fronts less and less as the inner radius of the disc is reduced ( see for example cannizzo et al .",
    ", cannizzo ) .",
    "the log prescription has the advantage of defining a grid with a fis which does not vary with radius .",
    "we conclude that reliable studies of the physical properties of transition fronts can not be completed in a reasonable amount of computational time by fixed grid codes .",
    "an exception ( see fig .  [ fig : dw ] ) is the structure of cooling fronts , which can probably be addressed , at least in the outer parts of the discs , by fixed sqr grid codes at high enough ( but reasonable ) numerical resolutions .",
    "we have constructed a numerical code which can calculate , in a reasonable amount of computer time and at very high spatial resolutions , long cycles of accretion disc outbursts .",
    "this code works efficiently in the most general framework of the disc instability model and does not require special assumptions about viscosity or outer or inner radii .",
    "its validity is of course limited by the way physical processes such as turbulent viscosity , convection , radiative transfer etc . are treated .",
    "of course it is also a 1d code modeling a fundamentally 2d ( or even 3d ) situation .",
    "since the mass of the central object enters the disc equations only in @xmath210 , we expect most of our results to be valid for bh disc models as well ( i.e. similar , but at a slightly smaller radius ) , as long as irradiation and general relativistic effects can be neglected .",
