    "localization of quantum and classical waves due to random ( anderson ) or quasiperiodic ( aubry - andre ) spatial inhomogeneity of an underlying lattice potential is a fundamental physical phenomenon manifested by light , sound , and matter waves @xcite ( see also a recent review @xcite ) . to date , rigorous results are available for the case of non - interacting quantum particles ( or classical linear waves ) only , while the many - body localization problem remains a complex open field , despite some recent advances @xcite .",
    "the computationally accessible case of few interacting quantum particles is therefore highly important and can give insights into the above complexity .",
    "earlier studies of two interacting particles ( 2ip ) in random lattices concluded that interaction inflates the single particle localization length @xmath0 up to another finite localization length @xmath5 @xcite . for quasiperiodic potentials the early predictions differed from an incremental increase of localization length to a decrease of localization length in the insulating regime @xcite .",
    "recent results reveal much more dramatic and unexpected effects of interactions .",
    "first , it was shown that some of the 2ip states in quasiperiodic lattices can become completely delocalized in the presence of a non - perturbatively strong interaction , giving rise to an unconstrained wave packet propagation @xcite .",
    "second , in disordered lattices , it was found that 2ip produce self - sustained subdiffusive propagation beyond the single particle localization length , provided that the disorder is weak and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this regime was associated with quantum chaos and high effective connectivity of states due to interaction @xcite .",
    "these findings intriguingly correlate with results obtained in the mean field approximation for ( infinitely ) many interacting particles , which lead to gross - pitaevsky type nonlinear wave equations @xcite .",
    "there nonlinearity destroys localization through deterministic chaos and leads again to subdiffusive wave packet propagation @xcite .",
    "the particular footprints of the chaotic nature of subdiffusion are seen in an asymptotically self - similar expansion of the wave packet @xcite and a subdiffusion exponent which depends on the power of nonlinearity @xcite , which is the classical analogue of defining the number of quantum particles needed for interaction , like two - body or three - body interactions .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that few - body interactions lead to subdiffusive propagation beyond the single - particle localization length for 2ip and three interacting particles ( 3ip ) .",
    "we will denote the specific cases with three particles as 3ip@xmath7 where @xmath8 holds for three particles with two - body interactions , and @xmath9 for three particles and exclusive three - body interactions . in the latter case a new interaction - induced localization length scale @xmath10 will set the spreading limits for wave packets .",
    "while two - body interactions are the typical situation encountered , three - body interactions appear to be more exotic",
    ". however , even such cases are currently experimentally addressable e.g. with cold polar molecules in optical lattices driven by microwave fields @xcite .",
    "we launch compact wave packets and show that few - body interactions lead to transient subdiffusion of wave packets , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , on length scales beyond @xmath0 .",
    "the subdiffusion exponent is not depending on the number of particles .",
    "two - body interactions yield @xmath3 for two and three particles , while three - body interactions decrease it to @xmath4 .",
    "the tails of expanding wave packets exhibit exponential localization with a slowly decreasing exponent .",

    "at the same time , the latter remains limited by anderson localization , and only the former defines growth and scaling of @xmath52 beyond the sp localization volume ( cf .",

    "the system size is varied within the limits @xmath53 ( 2ip ) and @xmath54 ( 3ip ) , whereas the integration time reaches @xmath55 for 2ip ( outperforming @xcite by an order of magnitude ) and @xmath56 for 3ip . the averaging is done over @xmath19 disorder realizations .",
    "our numerical results generalize earlier findings made for 2ip @xcite showing that different spreading regimes occur on two spatial scales ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath57 clearly demonstrates the initial fast wave packet expansion up to the sp localization length @xmath0 , followed by a slower spreading into a larger volume available due to the interaction - induced localization length @xmath5 . the first stage is invariable since non - interacting dynamics dominates . for the second stage ,",
    "the 2ip and 3ip@xmath36 cases with two - body interactions show the same type of subdiffusion ( fig.[fig:1](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "however three particles with three - body interactions ( @xmath58 ) drastically slow down the subdiffusive expansion beyond @xmath0 , as compared to the 3ip@xmath36 case .",
    "we are particularly interested in a regime of weak disorder when the limiting second spatial scales @xmath5 and @xmath59 are not reached during our simulations .",
    "we follow the evolution of the wave packet second moment , @xmath60 for 2ip , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( fig.[fig:2](a)-(c ) ) .",
    "we observe sub - ballistic expansion into the single particle volume of size @xmath0 .",

    "the respective non - interacting cases , @xmath65 , correspond to the dashed lines and demonstrate the halt of expansion once @xmath0 is reached .",
    "we also calculate the local tangent @xmath66 , in order to estimate the instantaneous subdiffusion exponent @xmath67 . in fig.[fig:2](d ) we observe that the instantaneous exponent @xmath67 shows a transient time - independent plateau at the corresponding values @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 and 2ip ) , whose width increases with decreasing strength of disorder .",

    "for 2ip we use the transformation @xmath73 and arrive at @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the effective on - site energies and @xmath76 are the ( 2nd order ) overlap integrals , or simply the off - diagonal matrix elements which provide with the corresponding hopping strength on the considered fock network .",
    "for 3ip we use @xmath77 and arrive at @xmath78 where @xmath79 and the 3d order overlap integrals are @xmath80 . note that for simplicity we added both two - body and three - body interactions into eq.([eq5 ] ) , while all our results hold exclusively for either @xmath81 or @xmath82 .    in this basis , particle interaction results in nonzero matrix elements ( the hopping integrals ) which connect different states in fock space . since all single particle states are anderson localized in real space",
    ", we can sort them with increasing mass center @xmath83 . ordering the modes by @xmath84 ,",
    "one obtains again effective two - dimensional ( 2ip ) and three - dimensional ( 3ip@xmath85 ) lattices .",
    "initial conditions localized in the original basis are localized there as well , and wave packet expansion on the original lattice necessarily involves excitation of new modes and spreading in the mode basis too .",
    "a simple perturbative argument predicts strong interaction between the states , for which the resonance conditions @xmath86 hold , where @xmath87 or @xmath88 @xcite . as the overlap integrals decay exponentially with distance between the modes , @xmath89 , an effective interaction between modes",
    "is restricted to a distance less than @xmath0 .",
    "it follows , that the wave packet spreading has to be confined to the neighborhood of the diagonal of the fock space lattice , such that positions of excited modes remain close , with additional selection by proximity of the fock state energies .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by direct numerical simulations that depict the norm distribution in fock space and parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 after @xmath92 evolution time for 2ip , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 after @xmath16 evolution time for 3ip .",
    "we start the dynamics with exciting a single fock state in the center of the fock lattice , @xmath95 for 2ip , and @xmath96 for 3ip @xcite .",
    "to begin with 2ip case , propagation along the diagonal , associated with interactions between @xmath97 and @xmath98 fock states , is accompanied by a rich structure of vertical and horizontal walks ( fig.[fig:4](a ) ) .",
    "the latter are produced by the near - resonant interaction between the fock states , for which one of the indexes coincides , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "it requires , in particular , @xmath101 , which can be realized at least for some of the modes from a single - particle localization volume , @xmath102 , whose overlap integrals are large @xcite . beyond @xmath0",
    "the overlap integrals decay exponentially and further wave packet propagation in vertical and horizontal directions is suppressed .",
    "finding an alternative near resonance away from the vertical or horizontal line is even less probable , as @xmath103 immediately boosts the energy mismatch between the fock states , @xmath104 ( recall that the spatial ordering of the modes in fig.[fig:4 ] does not maintain continuity in energy ) , in addition to decaying overlap integrals .",
    "plotting the difference between the norm distributions in the fock space at different moments of time , one clearly distinguishes the two main types of propagation .",
    "the first one takes place along the diagonal , @xmath105 , and the second one along a single coordinate , for selected @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "( fig.[fig:4](b ) ) .",
    "these observations are also valid in the case of 3ip , @xmath108 at @xmath16 ( fig.[fig:4](c , d ) ) , where propagation is again taking place along the main diagonal , @xmath109 , and , simultaneously , along a single coordinate , for some fixed @xmath110 , @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "this renders a close resemblance to the diffusion on comb lattices @xcite , the backbone presented by the diagonal , supported by the near - resonances between the quadruplets , @xmath113 , along with the horizontal and vertical ` fingers ' , supported by the pairwise near - resonances , @xmath114 , with no significant diffusion between the ` fingers ' .",
    "it is well - known that such systems develop subdiffusion in the backbone direction due to excursions of particles along the fingers @xcite .",
    "the effects of the order of interaction can be understood as the effects of an effective dimension increase . indeed , in the case @xmath115 , diffusion of 3ip is dominated by propagating pairs .",
    "the diffusion in fock space becomes effectively two - dimensional , resulting in the same exponent , as in the 2ip case .",
    "in contrast , when two - body interactions are forbidden , @xmath81 and @xmath116 , diffusion develops in the full three - dimensional fock space , along the diagonal as a back bone , and ` fingers ' possible in the two other dimensions .",
    "the increased number of potential directions for excursions away from the backbone of the multi - dimensional comb lattice slows the diffusion along the backbone direction even further .",
    "indeed , the subdiffusion exponent decreases with the increase of the dimension of the comb lattice , @xmath117 , as @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "in particular , it yields @xmath119 in two dimensions and @xmath120 in three dimensions , in an intriguing correspondence to our numerical observations .    the mean field limit for many interacting particles yields exponents which also depend on the order of the many - body interactions",
    ". in particular it follows that @xmath119 for two - body interactions and @xmath121 for three - body interactions in the so - called strong chaos regime @xcite ( these numbers change to @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the weak chaos regime ) .",
    "this is in semi - quantitative agreement with our presented data on few body quantum interactions .",
    "however the mean field limit yields density distributions which are remarkably different from the ones observed in the present work .",
    "the mean field wave function develops a thermalized core with almost constant density , bounded by exponentially localized tails with time independent slopes corresponding to @xmath0 and being independent of time . spreading taking place there through a growth of the core width .",
    "this is very different to the quantum few - body case , where we report on time dependent slopes of the exponentially localized distribution , and no evidence of a widening core with constant density .",
    "we studied the dynamics of few interacting particles in the weak localization regime on a disordered one - dimensional lattice and observed subdiffusive spreading beyond the single particle localization length .",
    "the subdiffusion exponent is determined by the type of many - body interactions : two - body interactions yield @xmath3 for both 2ip and 3ip , while three - body interactions reduce this number to @xmath4 .",
    "we relate our findings by comparing wave packet diffusion in the fock basis with diffusion on comb lattices .",
    "these comparisons leave us with a number of open questions , which will be addressed in future studies .",
    "the dynamics of ultracold atomic and polar molecular condensates in modulated potentials is a promising test bed field for our findings .",
