    "the present paper is devoted to the theoretical analysis of the ground state splitting of rare earth ( re ) @xmath0 ions semiconductor crystals .",
    "very well known and studied examples of such ions are eu@xmath3 and gd@xmath4 .",
    "it is believed that the magnetic properties of these ions are determined by the half filled 4@xmath5 shell . according to the hund s rule , for such electron configuration",
    ", the ground state should be characterized by the total angular momentum l=0 and the total spin s=7/2 . in other words",
    "the ground state should be @xmath6s@xmath7 which is eight fold degenerate , independently of the crystal environment .",
    "such a model explains quite well magnetic susceptibility or magnetization measurements where the spin of the ion interacts with external magnetic field or with the spin of another ion and the energies of zeeman or ion - ion exchange interactions are of the order of 1 k. + however , the electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) experiments , which probe the system on a much finer energy scale , clearly demonstrate that the above picture is an approximate one only .",
    "it turns out that in crystals the degeneracy of the ion s ground state is lifted , and the nature of the splitting depends on the symmetry of the enviroment .",
    "for example , for @xmath8 symmetry , the case we deal in the present paper with , the ground state is split into three levels , doublet , quartet and doublet . in accordance with the group theory ,",
    "the effective spin hamiltonian describing the splitting caused by the ion s crystal environment is of the form @xmath9 where the operators equivalents @xmath10 for spin s=7/2 are @xmath11 matrices defined , for example , in ref . .",
    "the energy levels of hamiltonian ( [ intro1 ] ) are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where the superscripts @xmath15 or @xmath16 denote the degeneracy of the levels .",
    "+ from epr experiments , if the quality of the samples is high , it is possible to obtain not only the absolute values of coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but also their signs .",
    "this may be achieved by performing measurements of the same sample in different temperatures .",
    "the splittings , together with levels degeneracies are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_spl ] for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the energy diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_spl ] correspond to the splittings of eu@xmath3 and gd@xmath4 ions in pbte .",
    "this compound is an example we will often refer in the present paper to , but the calculational methods and the general predictions of the theory may be applied to any semiconductor containing re @xmath21 state ions . from the literature we know , that for eu ion@xcite @xmath17=129 mhz , while for gd ion@xcite @xmath17=  -110.16 mhz .",
    "the coefficient @xmath18 is usually about two orders of magnitude smaller and because its influence on the ground state splitting is very small it will not be analyzed in the following .",
    "notice that the signs of @xmath17 for eu@xmath3 and gd@xmath4 ions are opposite .",
    "this is rather strange , because at the first sight , except for the small relative difference of nuclear charges these two ions are very similar and their crystal neighbourhoods are the same ( six tellurium atoms placed in the vertices of regular octahedron ) .",

    "the numbers show the degeneracies of the levels . ]",
    "the problem of the ground state splitting of rare earth @xmath22 ions is very old .",
    "very comprehensive discussion of the possible physical mechanisms leading to the splitting is due to wybourne.@xcite in ref .",
    ", using perturbation theory and results of numerical calculations he analyzed the case of gd@xmath4 ion in the crystal environment of @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "the main idea is , that due to strong spin - orbit interaction for @xmath24 electrons the higher energy @xmath25 states @xmath26 with different @xmath27 and @xmath21 are mixed into the ion s ground state @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , ... are numerical coefficients.@xcite due to nonzero @xmath30 , @xmath31 , ... the ion is no longer in pure @xmath22 state , it may interact with the crystal field and this iteraction leads to the ground state splitting .",
    "+ the results obtained by wybourne have been recently improved by smentek  et .",
    "al.@xcite . on the basis of extensive numerical relativistic calculations for gd@xmath4 ion",
    "they derived the effective spin hamiltonian for this ion in the crystal neighborhood of arbitrary symmetry ( relativistic crystal field theory ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath8 symmetry the effective spin hamiltonian may be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ intro1 ] ) where the coefficient @xmath17 reads @xmath32 the definitions and numerical values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 may be found in ref .  .",

    "taking eu and gd in pbte as example , we see that the relativistic crystal field theory alone can not simultaneously explain ground state splitting for both ions because the experimentally determined signs of @xmath17 are opposite .",
    "it is very improbable that replacing eu ion by gd ion we change the sign of @xmath36 because the neighborhoods of two ions are the same .",
    "we also do not expect significant changes of the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 because these two ions are very similar .",
    "+ the inadequacy of a model in which the re ion interacts with the enviroment by electrostatic crystal field potential only has been already noticed in the literature@xcite . in 1978 barnes et .",
    "al.@xcite , analysing the ground state splitting for gd@xmath4 ion in different crystals , noticed that in insulators there is proportionality between the crystal field coefficient @xmath36 and coefficient @xmath17 , while in metals such proportionality does not exist .",
    "they proposed a model in which @xmath24 electrons interact with the band states via hybridization processes . using second order perturbation theory with respect to the hybridization they constructed effective spin hamiltonian for the ground state of gd@xmath4 ion . as the excited states of the system they took into account configurations in which the number of electrons on @xmath24 shell changes by @xmath40 , i. e. @xmath41 configuration plus one hole in the fermi sea or @xmath42 configuration plus one additional electron in the band . according to the hund s rule , in the excited states @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "the angular momentum is nonzero .",
    "taking into account internal spin - orbit coupling , the authors of ref",
    ".   obtained effective spin - lattice interaction leading to the ground state splitting .",
    "+ in section iv we will rederive this model because we think that in its derivation and solution presented in ref .",
    "some important points have been missed .",
    "+ the main idea of barnes et .",
    "is very interesting , however the final results strongly depend on the constants describing the hybridization between @xmath24 electrons and the band states . due to strong localization of @xmath24 shell , in the literature ,",
    "it is very often assumed that it is very small .",
    "for example in calculations of the exchange integral between @xmath24 spin and band carriers in pbeute , dietl at .",
    "al.@xcite found that the contribution to the final result resulting from the hybridization @xmath24- band states processes is negligible .",
    "+ contrary to @xmath24 electrons , @xmath2 states of re ions are very extended in space and their hybridization with band states is certainly much stronger . in the literature",
    "we have found examples of successful explanations of magnetic properties of re ions in semiconductors which are based on the assumption that the interaction between @xmath24 electrons and band states goes via internal @xmath1 exchange interaction and @xmath2 - band states hybridization .",
    "for instance , using such a model , in 1970 kasuya@xcite explained the eu - eu exchange constant in euo .",
    "the kasuya mechanism was used also , as a starting point , by story et .",
    "al.@xcite in the theory explaining the fermi energy dependence of the gd - gd exchange constant in sngdte mixed crystals .",
    "the 4@xmath5  -  5@xmath31 interaction was also invoked by dietl et .",
    "al.@xcite in calculation of @xmath43 exchange integral between localized eu spin and the band carriers in pbeute .",
    "+ in the present paper we generalize this mechanism by including spin - orbit coupling and crystal field potential for @xmath2 states and apply it to the calculation of the coefficient @xmath17 . in the model , which will be explained and discussed in detail in the next sections , the ground state splitting occurs due to combined effect of the intra - atomic , heisenberg type , 4@xmath5 - 5@xmath31 exchange interaction , spin - orbit interaction on 5@xmath31 orbitals and the hybridization of re 5@xmath31 levels with the valence band states .",
    "our model takes automatically the spin - orbit interaction in the semiconductor host band states .",
    "it turns out that the functional dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath2 spin - orbit constant is different for semiconductors with strong band spin - orbit interaction from those for which this interaction may be neglected . for semiconductors with strong band spin - orbit effects",
    "one may expect that the proposed mechanism is more effective .",
    "one of the important parameters of the model is @xmath44 , the energy necessary to transfer an electron from the valence band to the 5@xmath31 shell .",
    "the magnitude of the resulting 4@xmath5 ground state splitting decreases very quickly with @xmath44 .",
    "that is why the position of @xmath2 level with respect to the fermi energy decides whether the mechanism is important or not .",
    "for example , as it will be discussed in section iii , for gd in pbte this energy is small , of the order of 0.5 ev@xcite and the resulting @xmath17 is of the order of the one observed in experiment , while for eu @xmath44 is a few times larger and the calculated splitting is much smaller .",
    "+ in the next section we describe the model and we derive approximate , analytical result for @xmath17 .",
    "this formula enables us to discuss the salient features of the model , in particular the dependencies of @xmath17 on the parameters of the theory . in section",
    "iii we present details of numerical calculations and section iv is devoted to rederivation and discussion of the model by barnes et .",
    "some additional remarks are contained in the last section .",
    "let us consider a semiconductor crystal with one cation replaced by re atom .",
    "the unperturbed part of our model hamiltonian describes ground and excited states of the system .",
    "these two groups of states are connected by @xmath2 - band states hybridization , which we treat here as a perturbation .",
    "below , we describe these two parts of hamiltonian .",
    "+ in the ground state of the system the electrons fill the band levels up to the fermi energy .",
    "we assume that the band structure is not changed significantly by the presence of re atom . in our model re atom",
    "is treated as the host cation atom with additional @xmath24 and @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "there are seven electrons on @xmath24 orbitals and @xmath2 shell is empty . assuming validity of the hund s rule , the spin of the ion @xmath45 and its angular momentum @xmath46 thus the ground state of the system is eight fold degenerate and is described by @xmath47 , the projection of spin on a quantization axis . + as the excited states we take configurations with one additional electron on the @xmath2 level and one electron less in the band .",
    "the hamiltonian describing @xmath48 configuration of the ion reads : @xmath49 the first term describes the exchange interaction between the @xmath24 spin @xmath50 and the spin @xmath51 of the @xmath2 electron .",

    "this eight fold degenerate state of the system is characterized by @xmath166 - the projection of @xmath25 spin 7/2 on a quantization axis which we take along the ( 001 ) crystallographic direction . in the excited states we have the ion in @xmath42 configuration plus one additional electron above the fermi level characterized , like in section ii , by the quantum number @xmath87 . assuming the validity of the hund s rule for @xmath42 configuration , l=3 and s=3",
    ", the hamiltonian for the ion in excited state reads : @xmath167 in the above equation the indices 2,4,5 correspond to the decomposition of the @xmath168 representation into irreducible representation @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 of the cubic group.@xcite for example @xmath172 is the angular momentum operator between base functions of @xmath170 representation and @xmath173 between @xmath170 and @xmath171 base functions .",
    "@xmath50 is the spin operator of the length s=3 and @xmath174 is diagonal matrix describing the crystal field potential .",
    "+ let us stress that from the physical point of view this is rather unreasonable to describe spin - orbit interaction using four different constants @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the @xmath24 shell is very localized and contrary to @xmath2 orbitals the influence of the neighbourhood should be negligible .",
    "the only reason of introducing four constants instead of a single one is , that it is easier to understand the influence of the crystal field on the coefficient @xmath17 . + the important difference between our formulation of the model and that of barnes et .",
    "al.@xcite is in the form of hybridization elements .",
    "we propose that @xmath179 the state @xmath180 is the excited state of the system in which the projection on the quantization axis of the total angular momentum and spin of the ion are @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively , and there is one additional electron characterized by @xmath87 above the fermi energy .",
    "the element @xmath183 describes hybridization between band state @xmath87 and the @xmath24 spin orbital @xmath184 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath185 , omitted in ref .  , may be derived using explicit forms of antisymmetric many electron functions for ion s states @xmath186 and @xmath187@xcite .",
    "+ the further steps of calculation of the effective spin hamiltonian are , with minor modifications , very similar to those described in the previous sections . because of much higher complexity of the angular momentum algebra for l = s=3 it is not easy to derive formulas analogous to those from section ii .",
    "that is why the conclusions are based on numerical calculations only , performed for pbte crystal , the example semiconductor we use in the present paper .",
    "+ in general , the results are similar to those for the model described in section ii .",
    "first , we observe decrease of modulus of @xmath17 with the increase of @xmath44 , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in this section",
    "@xmath44 denotes the energy necessary to transfer an electron from @xmath24 shell to the fermi energy level .",
    "secondly , for @xmath44 and other parameters of the model kept constant , @xmath17 changes with the crystal field potential parameter @xmath188 , however as we see in the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] these changes are not very fast .",
    "@xmath188 is defined here as the total splitting of @xmath42 manifold in the crystal field , i. e. @xmath189 .",
    "the mechanism of changes of @xmath17 with @xmath188 is similar to the one analysed in section ii . from the performed numerical analysis it turns out that @xmath1900 for @xmath178=0 .",
    "the relative energy positions of @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 states , which change with @xmath188 are important , because they decide about the effectiveness of the transitions between them caused by spin orbit interaction . however , comparing to @xmath2 , in the case of @xmath24 shell this influence is rather small .",
    "this is connected with completely different ratio of spin - orbit to the crystal field strength . for the @xmath24 orbitals the effects caused by the crystal field are much smaller than those due to spin orbit interaction . +",
    "this main difference between our results and those by barnes et .",
    "is that the authors of ref .",
    "overlooked the fact that even for zero crystal field potential we obtain nonzero ground state splitting of the re ion .",
    "this splitting , however , may be achieved only if the symmetry of the band wave functions and , consequently , the proper symmetry of hybridization matrix elements is taken into account . if these symmetries are neglected and the @xmath24 - band hybridization is described by a single constant @xmath191 , ( see ref .  ) then , apart from the crystal field potential , the rest of the system s hamiltonian is invariant with respect to operations of rotation group and the ground state remains degenerate .",
    "then , indeed , in the first approximation , the splitting will be proportional to the crystal field and this is the only contribution calculated in ref .  .",
    "+ on the basis of our analysis , see fig .  [ fig4 ] , it is clear that in the case of @xmath24 - band states hybridization , the most important parameter of the model is not @xmath188 but @xmath44 , the energy necessary to transfer an electron from @xmath24 shell to the conduction band .",

    "the insert shows the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath188 for @xmath44=0.5 ev . ]",
    "in this paper we have proposed the model leading to the splitting of the ground state of @xmath0 rare earth ions in crystals .",
    "the main ingredients of the model are @xmath1 exchange intereaction , spin orbit coupling for @xmath2 electrons and their hybridization with the band states .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed for pbte , a semiconductor from iv - vi group of compounds .",
    "we have also limited considerations to the @xmath8 symmetry of the ion s neighbourhood .",
    "of course , the model may be applied to any semiconductor and , with slight modifications in hybridization matrix elements , to lower symmetry cases .",
    "+ in section iv we have discussed the model proposed by barnes et .",
    "al . in particular , we have shown the importance of the careful treatment of symmetry of the hybridization matrix . if the symmetry of the problem of this kind ist lost due to too big simplifications in the model s formulation we may also loose important , from the physical point of view , class of solutions , as it has happened in ref .  .",
    "+ the general conclusion resulting from the analysis of both models is inaccordance with the point of view presented in ref .  , namely that the ground state splitting of @xmath0 ions in crystals is not governed by their internal properties only , but the position of the ion s @xmath24 and @xmath2 levels relative to the host crystal band structure is at least of equal importance .",
    "+ the model introduced in section ii , applied to gd@xmath4 and eu@xmath3 ions in pbte explains origin of opposite signs of the coefficients @xmath17 observed in experiment .",
