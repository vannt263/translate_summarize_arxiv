    "in choosing a sample for an evolution study , great care must be taken .",

    "the rcs photometric redshift catalog provides the 68% ( @xmath57 if the error distribution is gaussian ) computed photometric redshift error for each object .",
    "the photometric redshift uncertainty depends on the errors of the photometry for @xmath58 and colors .",
    "the computed error is estimated using a combination of the bootstrap and monte - carlo methods and it has been confirmed empirically to be very reliable .",
    "the details are described in @xcite .    for the sample used in the pair analysis",
    ", a photometric redshift error cut has to be defined .",
    "a looser error cut will make the sample more complete , but the final result will be noisier because data with larger errors are included .",
    "a tighter error cut will make the final result cleaner , but the incompleteness and bias problems will be more severe .",
    "for example , the bluer objects tend to have larger photometric redshift error and will be rejected more easily than red objects . if the pair result is color - dependent , the conclusion could be biased . as a compromise , we choose @xmath59 to be the criterion for the photometric redshift error cut for the sample .",
    "this criterion can eliminate those objects with catastrophic errors , and at the same time , the incompleteness and bias problems will not be too severe",
    ". furthermore , we deal with the incompleteness and bias problems with completeness correction ( see   [ completeness ] for details ) to minimize this selection effect .",
    "the completeness correction factor is estimated using the ratio of the total number of galaxies within a 0.1 mag bin at the @xmath28 magnitude of the companion to the number of galaxies in that bin with photometric redshifts satisfying the redshift uncertainty criterion .",
    "the incompleteness problem is more severe with fainter magnitudes because of the larger photometry uncertainty .",

    "it is clear that tighter criteria suffer from worse incompleteness at fainter magnitudes .    however , the completeness of the sample depends not only on magnitudes of @xmath35 and @xmath20 but also on colors ( e.g. , galaxy types ) . at lower redshift ,",
    "red objects are more complete than blue objects because early - type ( red ) galaxies have a clearer 4000  break which results in better photometric redshift fitting . at higher redshift",
    ", the incompleteness for red objects is getting worse ( even worse than that of the blue objects ) because the photometry of the blue filters is sufficiently deep for blue objects but not for red objects .",
    "we refine our completeness correction by computing the factor separately for red and blue galaxies .",
    "figure  [ color - specz ] represents the observed @xmath38 vs. spectral redshift relation .",
    "most objects in the upper locus are early - type galaxies , and for the lower locus , most of them are late - type galaxies . for the redshift range of our sampling criterion ( @xmath1 ) , we can simply use @xmath64 to roughly separate different types of galaxies .",
    "there are two ways to select samples to perform a pair analysis .",
    "one is volume - limited selection , the other is flux - limited selection . the volume - limited selection is a proper way to pick up objects with the same characteristics .",
    "however , most previous pair studies select flux - limited samples and then try to correct these samples to volume - limited samples using monte - carlo simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of the small number of galaxies in their database .",
    "the rcs photometric redshift catalog contains more than one million objects ; we can simply select a volume - limited sample and the number of objects is still statistically adequate for pair analysis .",

    "we decide to include data with completeness correction factors less than 2 in our sample , i.e. , all the data in our volume - limited sample are at least 50% complete ( marked by the heavy hashed lines ) .",
    "while the sample is not 100% complete , the completeness problem can be dealt with the completeness correction later .",
    "( see  [ completeness ] for details . ) hence , based on figure  [ absr - photoz ] and the diagrams for the other patches , we choose a volume - limited sample using the following criteria : @xmath1 , @xmath11 ( hatched region ) , for which the completeness factor is less than 2 .",

    ".      the pair statistics could be very different in different environments .",
    "it is very interesting to study how the environment affects the pair result .",
    "however , for a cluster environment , the pair analysis is much more difficult and a significant amount of calibration / correction needs to be done because the pair signals could be embedded in a cluster environment and are difficult to delineate . we may need to develop a different technique for the pair analysis for the highest density regions ( i.e. , clusters ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the pair statistics in the field . the rcs cluster catalogs @xcite are used to separate the field and the cluster regions . the cluster catalogs provide the information of the red - sequence photometric redshift , astrometry , and @xmath68 , estimated using the richness @xmath69 statistics of @xcite in mpc and in arcmin . an object inside @xmath70 of a cluster and having a photometric redshift within @xmath71 is considered as a potential cluster member .",
    "our rejection of clusters is fairly conservative ; we throw away pretty large regions in order to avoid biasing the field estimate , at the expense of having a smaller field sample .",
    "approximately 33% of the galaxies are rejected due to possibly being in clusters .",
    "the remaining objects are considered to be in the field and included in our sample .",
    "we use the quantity @xmath0 , defined as the number of close companions per galaxy , which is directly related to the galaxy merger rate , for our pair study .",
    "the definition of a close companion is a galaxy within a certain projected separation and velocity / redshift difference ( @xmath72 ) of a primary galaxy . after counting the number of close companions for each primary galaxy ,",
    "we calculate the average number of close companions , which is @xmath0 ( all the projected separations in this paper are in physical sizes , unless noted otherwise ) .",
    "previous pair studies with spectroscopic redshift data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use pair definitions of 5 - 20 kpc to 5 - 100 kpc for projected separation , and a velocity difference @xmath73 500km / s between the primary galaxy and its companions .",
    "however , because of the much larger redshift errors of the photometric redshift data , we can not use the same criterion of @xmath74 as other spectroscopic pair studies for our analysis ( @xmath75 at @xmath18 is equivalent to @xmath76km / s ) .",
    "thus , to carry out the pair analysis using a photometric redshift catalog , we develop a new procedure which includes new pair criteria and several necessary corrections .    for the projected separation , we can use the same definition as the spectroscopic pair studies . for the redshift criterion",
    ", we utilize the photometric redshift error ( @xmath60 ) provided by the rcs photometric redshift catalog to develop a proper definition .",
    "we define the redshift criterion of a pair as @xmath77 , where @xmath72 is the redshift difference between the primary galaxies and its companion , @xmath78 is a factor to be chosen , and @xmath60 is the photometric redshift error of the primary galaxy . due to the fact that the behavior of the pair fraction for major mergers ( pairs with similar mass ) and minor mergers ( pairs with a huge difference of mass ) could be different , one has to give a mass ( luminosity ) ratio limitation between the primary galaxy and its companion to specify the kind of merger being studied , i.e. , @xmath79 mag .",
    "we note that the absolute magnitude of @xmath28 should be used for the luminosity / mass difference criterion .",
    "however , since we use a photometric redshift catalog to perform the pair analysis , the redshifts of the primary and the secondary galaxies may be different due to the photometric redshift errors , which would make the difference of the @xmath51-corrected absolute magnitudes of the primary and the secondary galaxies larger than the luminosity difference criterion , even if they actually fit the criterion .",
    "hence , we choose to use the apparent magnitude instead of the absolute magnitude .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 approximately equals to the pair fraction when there are few triplets or higher order @xmath5-tuples in the sample . in this study , @xmath0 will sometimes simply be referred to as the pair fraction .",
    "in this section , we discuss the effects of incompleteness , boundary , seeing and projection , and the steps we take to account for them . in all our subsequent discussions and analyses , we will use samples chosen with the following fiducial common criteria , unless noted otherwise : @xmath11 for the primary sample , @xmath80 for the secondary sample , with galaxies selected satisfying @xmath81 and @xmath1 , and with the pair selection criteria of @xmath82 , 5 kpc @xmath83 20 kpc , and @xmath84 1 mag .      for a pair analysis ,",
    "the completeness of the sample is always an important issue .",
    "the pair fraction will drop due to the lower number density if the sample is not complete .",
    "furthermore , the main point of this paper is to study the evolution of the pair fraction , and unfortunately , the incompleteness is not independent of redshift : it gets more serious at higher redshifts .",
    "this effect is expected to make the pair fraction at higher redshifts appear lower , and thus may bias conclusions regarding the redshift evolution of the pair fraction .",
    "hence , to draw the correct conclusion , a completeness correction has to be applied .",
    "figure  [ pair - zerr ] illustrates the pair fractions for different sampling criteria in @xmath85 without completeness corrections ( but with projection correction , see  [ backcor ] ) .",
    "each redshift bin contains from 15,500 objects ( for the @xmath63 criterion ) the plot shows that the larger the @xmath60 criterion , the higher the pair fraction .",
    "this is due to less completeness for a tighter criterion ; some real companions in pairs are missed because they have larger photometric redshift errors .",
    "the differences between the pair fractions with different @xmath85 criteria also become larger with redshift because the incompleteness is more severe at higher redshift , especially for the @xmath63 criterion . however ,",
    "if a proper completeness correction is adopted , the pair results should not be affected by the sampling criteria and these curves of pair fraction with different @xmath85 cuts should be similar .",
    "we discussed the derivation of the completeness correction in  [ completeness - correction ] , and after applying the completeness correction , we find the pair fractions to be very similar for the different redshift uncertainty criteria , which shows that the completeness correction works well .",
    "the results after the completeness correction are shown in  [ result ] .",
    "objects near the boundaries of the selection criteria or close to the edges of the observed field could have fewer companions .",
    "this effect is referred to as a boundary effect .",
    "there are four different boundaries for our sample : @xmath86 the boundaries of the selection criterion on the redshift axis ; @xmath87 the edge of the observing field ; @xmath88 the boundaries between the cluster region and the field ; and @xmath89 the boundary of the absolute magnitude @xmath48 cut . the methods to deal with these boundary effects are described in this subsection .    the redshift range for our pair analysis is @xmath1 . for primary galaxies at redshift close to 0.25 or 0.8",
    ", they will have fewer companions because some of their companions are scattered just outside the redshift boundaries and thus are not counted . to deal with this effect",
    ", we conduct the pair analysis for the full redshift range of the photometric redshift catalog ( @xmath90 ) , and then pick the primary objects satisfying the redshift criteria for the final result .",
    "the objects near the boundaries of the observing field or near the gaps between ccd chips will have smaller pair fractions because some companions of these objects lie just across the boundaries of the observing field",
    ". the projected size of 20 kpc ( the outer radius of pair searching circle ) is about 5 `` ( 24 pixels ) at redshift at 0.25 ; the size gets smaller at higher redshift .",
    "we limit the primary sample to be at least 5 '' from the edges of the ccds while the secondary sample still includes all the objects .",
    "this configuration allows us to avoid the boundary effect of the limited survey fields .    because we only study the pair fraction in the field for this investigation and separate our data into field environment and cluster environment , the boundary effect at the edges of @xmath70 and @xmath71 is of concern .",
    "we constrain the primary sample to be at least @xmath70 from the centers of clusters and @xmath91 from @xmath92 . for the secondary sample ,",
    "we limit it to be at least @xmath93 from the center of clusters and @xmath94 from @xmath92 .",
    "these new limits effectively eliminate these boundary effects .",
    "the objects with absolute magnitudes close to the @xmath48 cut will have a lower pair fraction as well .",
    "this can be solved easily by searching for companions down to @xmath95 for the primary sample with @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ absr - photoz ] shows that the completeness correction factors are still less than 2 even when we push the @xmath48 boundary to -19 at @xmath96 for patch 0926 ( the light shaded area ) .",
    "however , for patches 0351 and 1327 , the completeness is significantly worse than other 8 patches , and they are substantially incomplete at @xmath97 .",
    "hence , they are abandoned in our pair analysis .",
    "consequently , the magnitude limit for the secondary sample is extended to minimize this boundary effect .",
    "because of the projection effect due to the lower accuracy of the photometric redshifts compared with spectroscopic redshifts , a pair analysis using any criterion would find some false companions and get a higher @xmath0 than the real value . to eliminate these foreground and background objects from contaminating our results ,",
    "a projection correction is applied to our data .",
    "the magnitude of the projection effect on @xmath0 is illustrated in figure  [ noback ] which shows the results of using the fiducial sample but with different @xmath98 criteria for inclusion of the companion without any projection correction ( but with completeness correction ) .",
    "each data point contains about 17,500 objects .",
    "@xmath0 is higher with larger @xmath78 values because the pair criterion with larger @xmath78 includes more foreground / background galaxies and the results suffer from more serious projection effect . for lower redshift ,",
    "the projected search area is bigger than the one for higher redshift ; hence more foreground / background galaxies are counted .",
    "however , the photometric redshift error @xmath60 becomes larger at higher redshift ; this effect also makes more foreground / background galaxies included .",
    "therefore , from low redshift to high redshift , the projection effect affects the pair fraction about equally .    to correct for the projection effect ,",
    "we calculate the mean surface density of all the objects in the same patch as the primary galaxy satisfying the pair criteria , @xmath77 and @xmath99 mag , and then multiply it by the pair searching area ( 5 - 20 kpc ) for each primary galaxy .",
    "this is the projection correction value for each primary galaxy .",
    "the completeness corrections are also applied in the counting of the foreground / background galaxies .",
    "the final number of companions for each galaxy is the proper companion number with the projection correction value subtracted .",
    "because not all primary objects have companions , some objects have negative companion numbers after the projection correction .",
    "the projected separation we use for the pair criteria is 5 kpc @xmath83 20 kpc .",
    "for the highest redshift cut ( @xmath12 ) used in our analysis , the projected size is about three pixels ( 0\".7 ) for 5 kpc ( the inner radius ) .",
    "however , some data are taken in less favorable weather conditions , and the 5 kpc inner radius could be too small for these data due to poor resolution . in the meantime , we do not want to enlarge the inner radius because the closest pairs are the most important for a pair study .",
    "we have to make sure that the 5 kpc inner searching radius does not cause problems with data obtained in poorer seeing conditions .",
    "we only focus on the seeing conditions of the @xmath28 images because object finding was carried out using the @xmath28 images ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the distribution of the seeing conditions of @xmath28 for the 8 patches is shown in figure  [ r - seeing ] . from this plot ,",
    "most seeing values are between three to six pixels . to test",
    "if the inner radius ( 5 kpc ) of the searching criterion is too small for data taken in poorer seeing conditions , we perform the pair analyses for three subsamples with different seeing conditions separately , separated at seeing @xmath100 pixels ( 0@xmath101.78 ) and @xmath102 pixels ( 0@xmath101.97 ) .",
    "each subsample contains a similar number of pointings .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ seeing ] .",
    "the left panel represents the relation of the apparent size in pixels for different physical sizes ( 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 kpc ) vs. redshift , as a reference , while the right panel shows the results with different seeing conditions .",
    "there are about 10,000 objects in each redshift bin .",
    "we find that the curve with the best seeing condition is in fact about 20% lower than the other two poorer seeing conditions , indicating that the range of seeing in our data do not cause a drop in @xmath0 .",
    "we note that most pointings with the best seeing conditions are from patches 1416 and 1616 ; the 20% lower @xmath0 for the good seeing data could be just due to cosmic variance .",
    "therefore , the 5 kpc inner searching radius for all the data does not appear to produce a significant selection effect on the result .",
    "the error of @xmath0 is estimated assuming poisson distribution and derived using : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total number of the companions , @xmath105 is the sum of the projection correction values , and @xmath106 is the number of the primary galaxies in each redshift bin .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the ones without the completeness corrections in order to retain the correct poisson statistics .",
    "the results of the pair analysis are shown in figures  [ sigma_z ] to [ sep-1 ] . because we focus only on major mergers , the difference in @xmath28 between the galaxies in close pairs",
    "is restricted to be less than one magnitude .",
    "if the mass - to - light ratio is assumed to be constant for different types of galaxies at the same redshift , the mass ratio between the primary galaxies and companions ranges from 1:1 to 3:1 .",
    "figure  [ sigma_z ] shows the results with different @xmath85 cuts , with the fiducial sampling criteria listed in ",
    "[ selection_effect ] , with completeness and projection corrections applied .",
    "the redshift bins contain from 15,500 objects ( for the @xmath63 criterion ) to 17,500 objects ( for the @xmath61 criterion ) .",
    "compared to figure  [ pair - zerr ] , the curves of the pair fractions are very similar for the different redshift uncertainty criteria , which illustrates that the completeness correction works well .    for the redshift criterion of the pair definition , we count companions within @xmath98 , where @xmath107 is the redshift of the primary galaxy and @xmath108 ( see  [ method ] ) . if the photometric redshift error is assumed to be gaussian , when @xmath109 , we count only about 68% of the companions ; when @xmath110 , about 95% ; and so on . of course , the criteria with larger @xmath78 will include more foreground / background galaxies and make @xmath0 higher , but this can be dealt with by the projection correction ( see   [ backcor ] for details ) .",
    "figure  [ nx ] represents @xmath0 vs. photometric redshift curves using different @xmath108 criteria with the fiducial sampling criteria , with completeness and projection corrections applied .",
    "pair fractions using the values @xmath111 and @xmath112 are plotted .",
    "we use @xmath113 to approximate @xmath114 which is equivalent to the result using no redshift information for companions .",
    "each data point contains about 17,500 objects .",
    "curves with @xmath115 are consistent with being the same .",
    "as discussed , the curve with @xmath109 should be about 32% lower than the one with @xmath113 if the distribution of the photometric redshift error is gaussian .",
    "the curve with @xmath109 is about 40% lower than the one with @xmath113 , and about 30% lower than the one with @xmath116 .",
    "while the results do not perfectly match what is expected from a gaussian distribution of photometric redshift uncertainties , comparing figure  [ nx ] to figure  [ noback ] , the application of the projection correction does reduce the @xmath0 derived by approximately the correct amount .",
    "the somewhat larger difference is not unexpected , since the true probability distribution of the uncertainty of the photometric redshift is likely non - gaussian , but somewhat broader .",
    "we note that the error bars with larger @xmath78 are bigger because of larger projection correction errors ( see  [ err_est ] for details ) .",
    "we choose @xmath116 for our final result ; with this , about 99% of the companions are counted , which is a compromise between the completeness of the companion counting and the size of the error of the projection correction .    in figure  [ pair_sep ]",
    ", we show @xmath0 using different outer radii of the projected separations for the pair criterion . the completeness and projection corrections are applied .",
    "we use an inner radius of 5 kpc for all cases .",
    "different line types and symbols indicate different outer radii from 20 kpc to 100 kpc . as expected , the larger the outer radius , the higher the @xmath0 because more galaxies satisfy the pair criteria . for better statistics , and because most previous pair studies use 5 - 20 kpc as their pair criteria ( since pairs with separations of 20 kpc will be almost certain to merge ) , we choose 5 kpc @xmath83 20 kpc to be the pair criterion for the projected separation for this study .    using 5 kpc @xmath83 20 kpc and @xmath82 , as our fiducial criteria , we find that the pair fraction increases with redshift as @xmath117 where @xmath4 .",
    "the best fit is plotted as a solid line on figure 11 .",
    "the error is estimated using the jackknife technique .",
    "we note that the error bar of the @xmath9 value is affected not only by the error bar of each redshift bin but also by whether the function @xmath117 is a good representation of the data .",
    "we also study the pair fractions with different absolute magnitude @xmath48 cuts and show the results in figure  [ m_rc ] .",
    "the filled circles and the open squares indicate the absolute magnitude bins of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "the numbers of objects in each redshift bin with absolute magnitude cuts for faint and bright are about 15,700 and 10,500 , respectively .",
    "we find that the pair fraction increases with redshift as @xmath3 where @xmath120 ( solid line ) and @xmath121 ( dashed line ) for the absolute magnitude bins of @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively ; i.e. , the brighter the absolute magnitude , the smaller the @xmath9 value .",
    "however , the error bar of the @xmath9 value is significantly larger for the high - luminosity sample . this effect is not due to the slightly larger error bars in the bright sample , but rather that the @xmath3 power - law does not appear to be a good representation of the evolution of @xmath0 for the higher luminosity galaxies . this result",
    "is further discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] .    based on figure  [ pair_sep ] ,",
    "it is apparent that the larger the outer radii , the lower the @xmath9 value is . to look at this in more detail , we use rings of area for the pair counting , and show the results of the evolution of @xmath0 in figure  [ sep-1 ] .",
    "we note that all @xmath0 values are normalized by area using the 5 - 20 kpc bin as the reference .",
    "the number of objects in each redshift bin is about 17,500 .",
    "the evolution of the pair fraction follow @xmath3 where @xmath122 , and @xmath123 for separation 5 - 20 kpc , 20 - 50 kpc , 50 - 100 kpc , 100 - 150 kpc , respectively .",
    "we note that the @xmath9 value decreases with increasing separation .",
    "this result is further discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "all these results show that the pair fractions do not change much with different @xmath108 criteria after applying the completeness and projection corrections , which indicates that our results are very robust ; however , the results do change with different projected separation criteria and absolute magnitude cuts .",
    "we note that the role of photometric redshift in reducing the size of the projection effect is relatively limited , as indicated by the similar error bars for the pair fractions in figure  [ noback ] for different @xmath78 .",
    "this is because the criterion of @xmath124 effective eliminates most of the foreground background galaxies .",
    "however , photometric redshift is essential in defining a volume - limited sample and deriving the redshift dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "although we have applied projection correction for our pair analysis , not all the close pairs we count will result in real mergers .",
    "objects satisfying the pair criteria that are in the same structure ( i.e. , under each other s gravitational influence ) are within 20 kpc projected distance , but not within 20 kpc in real 3-d space distance .",
    "@xcite estimates that the true merger fraction ( @xmath125 ) is about half of the pair fraction which is evaluated with a triple integral over projected and velocity separation by placing the correlation function into redshift space .",
    "hence , we divide @xmath0 by 2 to calculate the merger fraction .",
    "close pairs are considered as early - stage mergers . to relate the close pairs to the overall importance of merger",
    ", the merger timescale ( @xmath126 ) has to be estimated .",
    "following previous studies @xcite , assuming circular orbits and a dark matter density profile given by @xmath127 , the dynamical friction timescale ( @xmath126 in gyr ) is given by : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the physical pair separation in kpc , @xmath130 is the circular velocity in km s@xmath24 , @xmath131 is the mass in @xmath132 , and ln @xmath6 is the coulomb logarithm . we adopt the average projected separation ( @xmath31 15 kpc ) as the physical pair separation since the major merger fraction has been corrected from projected separation to three - dimensional separation .",
    "we also assume @xmath133 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the mean absolute magnitude of companions is @xmath134 . if the mass - to - light ratio of @xmath135 is assumed , we derive a mean mass of @xmath136 .",
    "@xcite estimates ln @xmath137 . with these values",
    ", we find @xmath138 gyr . we note that this value is just a rough estimate over systems with a wide range of merger timescales , but it still represents the average merger timescale in our sample .",
    "the comoving merger rate is defined as the number of mergers per unit time per unit comoving volume . according to @xcite ,",
    "it can be estimated as : @xmath139 where @xmath126 is the dynamical friction timescale , @xmath140 indicates the fraction of galaxies in close pairs that will merge in @xmath126 , and @xmath141 is the comoving number density of galaxies .",
    "the factor 0.5 is to convert the number of galaxies into the number of merger events .",
    "we adopt @xmath142 gyr and @xmath143 , as discussed above .",
    "we compute @xmath141 using the primary sample , with the weight corrections included .",
    "we note that the computed @xmath141 show a slight decline at @xmath144 , which may be an indication of the effect of using a simple luminosity evolution description of @xmath145 for @xmath146 for choosing the sample .",
    "the evolution of the merger rate is shown in figure  [ merger_rate ] .",
    "each data point includes 17,500 objects and the error bars do not include the uncertainties in @xmath126 and @xmath140 .",
    "comparing our merger rate to @xcite measured between @xmath147 to 1.2 , our value is about 3 times lower .",
    "the primary reason is likely that we use @xmath99 mag and search for major mergers with mass ratio from 1:1 to 3:1 , but @xcite look for mergers with mass ratio from 1:1 to 6:1 .",
    "our results show an increase in the merger rate with redshift of the form @xmath148 , with @xmath149 .      with the derived major merger rates for several different epochs for @xmath150 and the merger timescale , we can use these parameters to estimate the fraction of present day galaxies which have undergone major mergers in the past .",
    "these galaxies are merger remnants , and the fraction of the merger remnants is defined as the remnant fraction ( @xmath151 ) . according to @xcite , the remnant fraction is given by @xmath152 where @xmath125 is the merger fraction , @xmath153 is the redshift which corresponds to a lookback time of @xmath154 , and j is an integer factor . because the mass ratio of galaxies in a pair for this study is from 1:1 to 3:1 , the merger remnant fraction is for major mergers . after applying this equation to our pair result , the estimated remnant fraction is @xmath10 , which implies that @xmath155 of galaxies with @xmath11 have undergone a major merger since @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath9 values determined in many previous observational results in similar redshift ranges are very diverse ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these results from the literature are listed in table  [ m - value ] in the order of redshift , and briefly discussed in  [ introduction ] . from @xmath6 cdm @xmath5-body simulations @xcite , the merger rates of halos increases with redshift as @xmath3 , with @xmath13 .",
    "our result for @xmath11 is broadly consistent with the @xmath5-body simulations as well as all the previous observational results , except those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the previous works , except that of @xcite , used spectroscopic redshifts to study pairs , especially for the lower redshift ranges . due to much smaller samples ( @xmath157 of our sample )",
    "these studies need to convert a flux - limited sample to a volume - limited sample ; this conversion may affect the final results .",
    "we note that all the previous studies did not exclude possible cluster environments , which may cause a problem of transforming @xmath0 to pair fraction , just because a galaxy would have a much higher chance to have more than one companion in cluster environments , relative to in field environments ; the value of average number of companions per galaxy is not a good representation of pair fraction anymore .",
    "we do not have this problem because potential cluster members in our sample are removed , and less than 2% of pairs actually consists of triples or more in our work .",
