    "quantum tunneling through a barrier , as a paradigm of quantum mechanics , has been observed in different systems , such as two superconductors separated by a thin insulator  @xcite , two reservoirs of superfluid helium connected by nanoscopic apertures  @xcite , and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in double wells  @xcite . comparing with the former two systems , becs in double wells",
    "offer a versatile tool to study the quantum tunneling phenomena due to the fact that almost each parameter , such as the inter - well tunneling strength , the inter - particle interaction , and the energy bias between the two wells , can be tuned experimentally .",
    "the competition between those parameters makes becs in double wells exhibit several fascinating phenomena , like rabi oscillation , self - trapping , and josephson oscillation , which have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "when a condensate is expected to be employed as a qubit , the first obstacle attempted to be avoided is the decoherence which was studied in experiment through the interference between becs  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the effect of decoherence on the dynamics of becs in double wells was recently discussed with the help of single - particle density matrix  @xcite .",
    "the problem of decoherence in qubit measurement was recently investigated  @xcite with a bec in double wells . in current literature ,",
    "the most of authors paid more attention on the time evolution of the atom distribution but less attention on the relative phase between the condensates in two wells .",
    "meanwhile , the systems were mostly assumed to be completely coherent at the initial time .",
    "since both relative phase and degree of coherence are believed to affect the dynamical properties of becs in double wells , it is worthwhile to study the coherence dynamics with attention to the relative phase and the degree of coherence .    in this paper , we study a bec system in double wells with different degrees of coherence . in mean - field approximation",
    ", we study the dynamical properties of the system in different regimes with the help of the single - particle density matrix and show that , in comparison to the completely coherent case , partially coherent becs in double wells can exhibit richer physics . in the next section , we model the partially coherent system and give the mean - field dynamical equation for the elements of single - particle density matrix . in sec .",
    "[ sec : coherence ] , we study the evolution of the degree of coherence and discuss the dynamical property of the partially coherent system in fock regime . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rabi ] , we study the system in rabi regime and discuss the influence of degree of coherence on the rabi oscillation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : selftrap ] , we study self - trapping phenomenon for the partially coherent system .",
    "then brief summary and discussion are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "we consider a bose - einstein condensate confined in a double - well potential , where atoms can tunnel between the two wells .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system in the second - quantization form is given by , @xmath0 where the bosonic operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates and annihilates an atom in the @xmath4th well , respectively ; and @xmath5 is the particle number operator . here the parameter @xmath6 denotes the energy bias between the two wells , @xmath7 is the inter - well tunneling strength , and @xmath8 is the interaction strength between atoms .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamquan ] ) can describe not only the bec in double wells but also that in two hyperfine states  @xcite .",
    "this model was conventionally studied in a mean - field approach by replacing the expectation values of annihilators in two different wells with two complex numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively  @xcite . in those works ,",
    "the system is essentially assumed to be of complete coherence , _",
    "i.e. _ , the condensate stays in a completely coherent superposition state @xmath11 . whereas , a realistic system of condensates may be not always in complete coherence for various situations .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to study the dynamical properties of partially coherent becs in double wells .    as we know",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the single - particle density matrix @xmath12 with entities @xmath13 where the expectation value is taken for the initial state of the system .",
    "clearly @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the population in the first and in the second well , respectively . with the help of heisenberg equation of motion for operators",
    ", one can derive the dynamical equations for the elements of the aforementioned density matrix by the mean - field approach in the semiclassical limit .",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 is set to unit and @xmath18 .",
    "the conservation of particle number requires that @xmath19 .    as the @xmath20 density matrix can be expanded as @xmath21 with @xmath22 s the pauli matrices and @xmath23 a vector inside the so - called bloch sphere .",
    "since @xmath24 refers to a pure state ( completely coherent superposition ) while @xmath25 refers to a mixed state ( partial coherence ) , one can measure the degree of coherence by @xmath26 .",
    "thus a natural definition of the degree of coherence is given by  @xcite @xmath27 which is an important quantity that affects the dynamical features , such as rabi oscillation , self - trapping , etc .",
    "with the help of the mean - field dynamical eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyeq ] ) for the single - particle density matrix , the dynamics of the system can be investigated .",
    "we know that the ratio of the interaction strength @xmath8 to the tunneling strength @xmath7 determines three distinct regimes , namely , the rabi regime , @xmath28 , the josephson regime , @xmath29 , and the fock regime , @xmath30 .",
    "the system manifests different dynamical features in different regimes , which will be given in the following sections .",
    "to study the evolution of the degree of coherence , we can conveniently introduce the pseudospin operators , @xmath31 which obey commutation relations for the angular momenta @xmath32= i\\epsilon_{_{jkl}}\\hat{j}_l$ ] , and fulfil @xmath33 for systems of @xmath34 bosons . in terms of these pseudospin operators ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamquan ] ) can be written as , @xmath35 this implies that the dynamical properties are determined only by the direction of the pseudospin @xmath36 since its magnitude is fixed on @xmath37 .",
    "we know that the eigenvalue of @xmath38 is @xmath39 , which refers to the population imbalance between the two wells . for convenience ,",
    "let us introduce the canonically conjugated operator @xmath40 of @xmath38 to characterize the relative phase , which can be regarded as the angle of @xmath41 in the @xmath42-@xmath43 plane in the angular - momentum picture . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the operator @xmath40 can be defined through @xmath44 , where @xmath45^{-1/2}(\\hat{j}_x+i\\hat{j}_y).\\ ] ] such a definition satisfies @xmath46=\\exp{i\\hat{\\varphi}}$ ] which is consistent with the condition @xmath47=-i$ ] , so that @xmath38 and @xmath40 are canonically conjugated to each other .",
    "then , in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath40 , equation  ( [ eq : hamimom ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath48    in the fock regime , the tunneling strength is much smaller than the interaction one between atoms , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath49 , hence the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ht ] ) can be neglected . such a condition can be satisfied in experiment through increasing the distance between the two wells or enhancing the height of the potential barrier separating the two wells",
    ". then the dynamical equations in this regime become , @xmath50 which means that the difference in particle numbers between the two wells is fixed but the relative phase @xmath51 evolves with time . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : coherence ] ) and the definition of pseudospin operators , the degree of coherence can be written as @xmath52 from the definition of @xmath40 , one can also get @xmath53 since the expectation value of @xmath38 is fixed in the extreme fock limit @xmath54 , the evolution of the degree of coherence only depends on that of @xmath40 .",
    "for example , if the particle numbers in the two wells are the same at the initial time , the expectation value of @xmath38 will be always fixed on zero in the extreme fock limit . in this case",
    ", the degree of coherence becomes @xmath55 , which reflects that the evolution of the degree of coherence is determined by the interaction strength @xmath8 , the detuning @xmath6 and the initial state of the system .    as we know , the fock bases @xmath56 composing the @xmath57-dimensional hilbert space of the system are @xmath58 where @xmath59 corresponds to the quantum number of @xmath38 denoting the half of the difference in the particle numbers between the two wells .",
    "since any initial state can be written as @xmath60 the degree of coherence can be obtained as long as @xmath61 is given .",
    "taking @xmath62 as an example and replacing the sum over @xmath59 by an integral , one can obtain the degree of coherence . if keeping the lowest order term in the taylor expansion in the calculation of the expectation value of @xmath63 , we have @xmath64 this expression is valid when the width of the gaussian distribution is much smaller than @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath65 .",
    "clearly , the degree of coherence decays with time as long as there is interaction between atoms . such result tells us that one can prepare systems with different degrees of coherence through changing the evolution time @xmath66 in the extreme fock regime . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : excohere ] ) , we can also find that the larger the @xmath67 is , the faster the degree of coherence will decay .",
    "then one can suppress the decay through decreasing the value of @xmath67 .",
    "note that in the above calculation of @xmath68 , we used @xmath51 which is valid only for the extreme fock regime . in the other regimes",
    ", one needs to solve eq .",

    "rabi oscillation is an important phenomenon reflecting the coherent property of a system , which has been discussed recently  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the initial state was assumed to be a pure state , _",

    "whereas , according to our formulation in sec .",
    "[ sec : coherence ] , one can prepare states with different degrees of coherence , which makes rabi oscillation worthwhile to be studied from a new angle of view .",

    "for example , we consider a initial state described by the density matrix @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we can obtain the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyeq ] ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is a real number related to the degree of coherence , _",

    "[ fig : rabiosc ] , we can see that the particle numbers in the two wells both periodically oscillate with time .",
    "the oscillation amplitude @xmath83 diminishes with the decrease in the degree of coherence . here",
    "the relative phase between the condensates in two wells is taken as zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath84 is real at the initial time .",
    "if the degree of coherence is fixed but the relative phase is not zero , saying @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we can also solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyeq ] ) analytically ( the expression of @xmath87 is omitted for saving space ) .",
    "one can find that the amplitude of rabi oscillation is affected by the initial values of the degree of coherence as well as the relative phase .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we plot a numerical result of the rabi oscillation in the presence of interaction ( @xmath88 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabiosc ] ( b ) . comparing the two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabiosc ] , we can see that the interaction between atoms will make both the amplitude and the period of the rabi oscillation decrease for the same initial states .",
    "the above discussions tell us that one can obtain the degree of coherence through measuring the amplitude of the rabi oscillation in experiment . for example , like in the experiment  @xcite , prepare a bec in one hyperfine state and transfer one half of atoms into the other hyperfine state through a two - photon pulse ; turn off the pulse to allow the system to evolve freely without the inter - state tunneling ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath54 ) until @xmath89 . then turn on a pulse which makes the atoms tunnel between the two states and measure the amplitude of the rabi oscillation . because the system is in the extreme fock regime when @xmath90 , based on the calculation given in sec .",
    "[ sec : coherence ] , we can have @xmath91 and @xmath92 at the time @xmath93 .",
    "such a state can be actually prepared as the initial state of the subsequent rabi oscillation procedure .",
    "note that the expression of @xmath94 can be also rewritten as @xmath95 considering the definition of @xmath96 .",
    "since the relative phase @xmath97 is determined , the amplitude of rabi oscillation only depends on the degree of coherence .",
    "the analytical result of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyeq ] ) can not be obtained due to the existence of interaction terms in the above example , so one can solve it numerically .",
    "the degree of coherence can be determined through fitting the experimental rabi oscillation profiles with the theoretical ones as the degree of coherence is evolved .",
    "as we know , the most prominent feature of atomic tunneling between two wells is the nonlinear dynamics arising from the interaction of atoms .",
    "whereas , equations  ( [ eq : dyeq ] ) can not be analytically solved once the interaction terms are taken into account . in this case , we solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dyeq ] ) numerically . in the numerical calculation",
