    "bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) are an extreme form of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which exhibit rapid flux variability at all frequency , high polarization , and weak or non - existent spectral features . along with their cousins , the flat - spectrum radio quasars ,",
    "they form the blazar class of agn . the model which best describes blazars is one in which a jet of relativistic material is beamed directly at us @xcite .    although among the rarest types of agn , bl lacs are particularly important precisely because we can look into their jets . in this way",
    ", we can see the site of energy production which is presumably close to the central engine , or black hole .",
    "thus , by studying these enigmatic objects we can better understand the central black hole in all other agn .    one way of studying these objects , which is independent of any assumptions made about the nuclear regions and energy production , is by their environments . there is growing consensus that bl lacs are found on average in poor clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , some individual objects ( e.g. pks 0548322 ) are found in rich clusters @xcite .",
    "work has progressed on the kilo - parsec - scale environments , or host galaxies of bl lacs as well .",
    "bl lacs are found in giant elliptical galaxies with @xmath2  mag @xcite .",
    "some individual objects were thought to be hosted by spiral galaxies , but high resolution observations have shown them to be ellipticals @xcite .",
    "high resolution images of the host galaxies of six radio - selected bl lac objects observed with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ have been presented in and .",
    "these are relatively deep wfpc2 images from cycle 5 . in addition",
    ", we are currently analyzing the host galaxies and extended environments of more than 100 bl lac objects at redshifts 0.03 - 1 observed by hst as part of a snapshot project ( pesce et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ; scarpa et al .",
    "2000 in preparation ; urry et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "the combined dataset will allow a thorough investigation of bl lac environmental properties over a large redshift range .",
    "in this paper we present the analysis of the extended environments of six radio selected objects from our hst cycle 5 go project ( pi urry ) . to this sample we have added three x - ray selected objects obtained from the hst archive and observed during cycle 5 ( pi jannuzi ) .",
    "we assume h@xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath6 .",
    "the objects were observed with the wfpc2 and the f814w ( i - band ) filter , the bl lac was centered in pc camera .",
    "exposure times varied and were approximately 10 min to 1.5 hours ( see table 1 ) .",
    "more details about the reduction and analysis of these fields can be found in .",
    "we used the focas software , in iraf , to detect and classify all objects on an image and produce a catalog ( figure 1 ) .",
    "for the central bl lac , the point spread function ( psf ) was created with tiny tim @xcite ; each object is classified as ` star ' or ` galaxy ' based on an automatic comparison of its profile to a standard psf profile . in these images , we detect objects down to a `` completeness limit '' of @xmath7 .",
    "objects fainter than the completeness limit are not considered in the analysis of the images .",
    "the automatic identifications from focas were checked with simulated images consisting of stars , galaxies , and noise .",
    "focas detected and correctly classified all objects above the completeness limit and 90% of objects below the limit .",
    "as a further check , the galaxy density on each image was compared to the average background density for the f814w filter from casertano ( 1997 , priv com ) .",
    "and the pc is @xmath8280 kpc square , while the maximum complete radius sampled ( the straight lines and arc ) is @xmath80.7 mpc.,width=377 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath9 apparent magnitude of a typical galaxy , assuming @xmath10 .",
    "no k - correction has been applied .",
    "to avoid background contamination , we only count galaxies with @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the pc images subtend 0.3 arcmin@xmath13 while the wf chips subtend 1.5 arcmin@xmath13 giving a maximum radial extent from our bl lacs of 0.4 - 0.8 mpc .",
    "most bl lac clusters are found within 0.5 mpc of object @xcite . however , because of the wfpc2 geometry , we only observe @xmath81/2 of the volume surrounding the bl lac .",
    "we checked our procedures by analyzing an archival image of the rich cluster abell 2390 ( richness class 1 , @xmath14 , exposure = 2100 s ) . on this image",
    ", we detected a significant ( factor 9 - 20 ) overdensity of galaxies .",
    "for our objects , we * detect enhancements ( factor 2 - 4 ) above background in four cases : * 1407 + 599 , 1538 + 149 , 1823 + 568 , 2143 + 070 .",
    "a modest enhancement is found around 2254 + 074 , but this object has the lowest redshift so we are observing only a small part of the potential cluster volume .    * no enhancements * are found for 0814 + 425 , 0828 + 493 , 1221 + 249 , 1308 + 326 . given our completeness limit , and assuming correct redshifts , we _ should _ detect any cluster present ( if the cluster is approximately symmetric ) . *",
    "these objects appear to be truly isolated . *",
    "we have analyzed the extended environments of nine bl lac objects observed with the hst wfpc2 in the f814w filter .",
    "the long exposures provide deep ( @xmath15 mag ) images .",
    "we find significant enhancement of galaxy density around four of the nine bl lac objects ( 1407 + 599 , 1538 + 149 , 1823 + 568 , 2143 + 070 ) . in some cases ( 1407 + 599 ,",
    "1823 + 568 ) the enhancement is extreme , with dozens of galaxies within @xmath8150 kpc of the bl lac object .",
    "the remaining five fields show no indication of excess galaxy counts .",
    "in fact , some fields are slightly below the average background galaxy density , although in general the galaxy density is consistent with the background .",
    "these objects are either truly isolated , their clusters are unusually asymmetric ( and strangely all out of the field of view ) , or the redshifts are incorrect . of these three explanations ,",
    "the first is most likely .",
    "thus , some bl lac objects appear to be in regions of significantly enhanced galaxy density , while others seem to be completely isolated .",
    "this result is not surprising given that bl lac hosts appear to be otherwise normal giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "such galaxies are found in all types of environments - from rich clusters to isolated regions of space . nonetheless if galaxy interactions play an important role in the agn activity ,",
    "future work needs to address this point .",
    "our sample is too small to determine differences between x - ray and radio selected objects , a point to be addressed in our analysis of the larger hst snapshot survey .",
