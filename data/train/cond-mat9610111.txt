    "in this paper we report _ ab initio _ calculations of equilibrium geometries , formation energies , and extrinsic gap levels of vacancies in @xmath0-quartz .",
    "we concentrate on oxygen vacancies , which are common defects in both silica ( amorphous sio@xmath1 ) and quartz , and alleged to be precursors of other more complex defects @xcite . in view of the short - range order conservation upon thermal amorphization of quartz , which basically rules out complex multicenter native defects ,",
    "the state - of - the - art results for oxygen vacancies in crystalline quartz to be discussed below are expected to shed some light on defect phenomenology in amorphous silica .",
    "recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the amorphization of a small ( 128-atom ) sample of @xmath0-quartz via melt quenching @xcite have given evidence for an almost perfect conservation of short range order in the amorphous phase ; the structure obtained in the simulation @xcite maintains chemical order , with si - centered tetrahedra linked by corner - sharing oxygens . in these simulations , disorder manifests itself merely as a broadening of the distribution of si - o - si angle between linked tetrahedra ; the o - si - o angle distribution has instead a sharp maximum close to the tetrahedral angle of 109@xmath6 .",
    "edge - sharing tetrahedra are absent in the amorphous phase , but they occasionally appear in the liquid @xcite . on the other hand , even in the liquid",
    "the dominant defects are simple miscoordinated atoms ( 3- or 5-fold coordinated si , and 1- or 2-fold coordinated o ) , occurring with small ( @xmath7 10 % ) probability . although the predictions of ab initio molecular dynamics may be considered too optimistic ( mostly , because of the smallness of the simulated amorphous sample ) , it is clear that even the simplest defects are not easily formed thermally in sio@xmath1 .",
    "more complex defects are likely to be even more rare .",
    "a study of lattice vacancies seems therefore timely , also because , although many semiempirical studies @xcite have appeared in the past , even these simple defects have not been widely studied at the ab initio level ( recent density - functional - theory studies are reported in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , no systematic study exists , to our knowledge , dealing with the charge states of the o vacancy beyond the neutral and + 1 states @xcite .",
    "we perform ab initio density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite plane - waves pseudopotential calculations , using ultrasoft - pseudopotentials @xcite , which guarantee a high degree of transferability and a fast convergence in fourier space of all the relevant quantities @xcite .",
    "a plane - waves basis is used with a cut - off at 20 ryd .",
    "a conjugate - gradient total - energy minimization @xcite is used to obtain the self - consistent electronic ground - state at fixed ions , and an efficient relaxation method @xcite is used to reach the minimum energy structure following hellmann - feynman forces .",
    "we employ 36-atom orthorombic supercells with no imposed symmetry , and one special * k * point as brillouin zone sampling .",
    "this setting gives structural properties in agreement with those obtained by liu _",
    "@xcite , matching experiment to better than 1 % , apart from two o internal parameters having a deviation of @xmath7 2% .",
    "the formation energy for an o vacancy in sio@xmath1 in charge state _ q _ ( where , conventionally , @xmath2 is the number of electrons transferred from the defect to a reservoir of chemical potential @xmath8 ) is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total energy difference between the defected supercell in charge state @xmath2 and the perfect bulk supercell , and @xmath8 is the electron chemical potential ( i.e the fermi level in our t=0 calculation ) .",
    "the zero of @xmath8 may be assumed to be the top valence band energy @xmath11 of the defected crystal in the charge state @xmath2 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath12 is one half of the total energy of the spin - unpolarized o@xmath1 molecule ( calculated in a large supercell ) .",
    "as expressed above , the formation energy depends on the charge state and on the fermi level .",
    "the latter embodies the effects of background doping , competing defect species , or externally injected carriers .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of a crystal with a fixed number of electrons have no rigorous relationship to observable optical transition , unless they are many - body quasiparticle energies .",
    "this is also the case for defected crystals , and for transitions involving extrinsic levels therein . in particular , transitions to and from extrinsic levels",
    "can not simply be extracted as differences of dft eigenvalues of e.g. the neutral state of the defect .",
    "this is true for any one - body theory , including hartree - fock calculations @xcite , since koopman s theorem gives ( e.g. ) an ionization potential which is not exact even in principle . within dft",
    "one can resort to total energy differences , since the dft total energy is exact in principle , apart from the local density approximation ( lda ) and other technical issues of practical relevance @xcite .",
    "in particular , in a dft calculation one calculates formation ( i.e. total ) energy differences between the relevant systems . for e.g.",
    "the case of @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=1 , this difference is , by definition , the energy needed to extract an electron from the @xmath2=1 state ( ionization of the charged center ) leaving behind a @xmath2=0 center , or to add one to the @xmath2=0 state ( binding to the neutral center ) transforming it into a @xmath2=1 state .",
    "when account for geometrical changes upon occupation is taken , this difference is the thermal excitation level ; `` thermal '' indicates that the structure is allowed sufficient time to rearrange to its new equilibrium position .",
    "we concentrate on the calculation of this quantity , and discuss later optical transitions .",
    "apart from basic choices such as the use of the lda as opposed to gradient - corrected functionals , the uncertainties in the predicted defect energy levels arise mainly from the alignment of the energy zero of differently - charged supercells .",
    "since we choose conventionally the fermi level zero at the valence band top , @xmath13 0 charge states have a constant energy offset @xmath14 away from the neutral state energy ( eq . [ eform ] ) .",
    "we proceed by calculating the _ bulk _ valence band top @xmath15 in a bulk supercell , and express the valence top in the charged supercell as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the difference of the macroscopic averages@xcite of the local potentials of the charged supercell and of the bulk supercell , @xmath18 this quantity is evaluated in an appropriate bulk - like region , i.e. regions of the simulation cell where the local potential is unaffected by the defect .",
    "the resulting uncertainties are at most of order @xmath19 0.1 ev in the thermal ionization levels .",
    "for the neutral state of the vacancy , the formation energy is 6.97 ev .",
    "such large energy is in accord with the need for irradiation to produce vacancies in the first place . as seen from fig .",
    "[ f1eform ] , the vacancy is stable in the @xmath2=+3 state for fermi level values of up to 2 ev above the valence band top .",
    "thereafter , the neutral state becomes stable , and remains such for fermi levels up to about 5.5 ev .",
    "the neutral state is therefore the ground state of the oxygen vacancy in nominally undoped quartz , i.e. for the fermi level at mid - gap ( @xmath7 4.5 ev ) . increasing further the fermi level , the vacancy becomes negatively charged .",
    "the @xmath20 charge state is the most stable state for fermi levels ranging from about 5.5 ev to 8 ev ( neglecting the small fermi level range from 5.5 ev to 5.7 ev , where the 2 state prevails ) .    while the thermal level sequence which is usually expected is @xmath2",
    "= + 3 , + 2 , + 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ... , in the present case we find a negative - u behavior @xcite between the triply positive state and the neutral state , and between the neutral and the @xmath20 state : the @xmath3 + 2 and @xmath3 + 1 states are unstable against the release of a further electron , and the @xmath2=1 and @xmath2=2 states are unstable towards the capture of a further electron .",
    "this is due to a strong electron - lattice coupling , as is discussed below .",
    "the realization of large-@xmath2 negative and positive states is not unusual for wide gap materials .",
    "the @xmath21 vacancy is a symmetric combination of si dangling bonds .",
    "the si neighboring to the vacancy relax almost symmetrically , by 9.5 % of the unrelaxed si - o bond length , towards the vacant site . in fig .",
    "[ f2rho0 ] , we display density isosurfaces for the defect state of the neutral vacancy .",
    "the only stable positive charge state is the @xmath2=+3 state .",
    "the two si atoms neighboring to the vacancy relax strongly away from their original positions in an asymmetric fashion : their distance to the vacancy site increases from 1.62  to 2.16  , and from 1.61   to 2.81  , respectively .",
    "the two si atom are three - fold coordinated and close to co - planar with the neighboring oxygens .",
    "the charge density of the last occupied state is delocalized , suggesting that the defect level is resonant with the valence band .",
    "the thermodynamical instability of the singly positive vacancy signals potential difficulties in previously proposed models @xcite of the so called e@xmath22 center .",
    "the @xmath23 charge state is the antibonding combination of the same dangling bonds as above , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f3rho-1 ] ( compare with the previous figure ) .",
    "additional relaxations with respect to the neutral state are below 1% .",
    "thus , electronic promotion into this state will require a ( rather large ) energy of almost purely electronic origin .",
    "in the @xmath24 charge state , the first antibonding state gets completely filled .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath23 , a large , markedly asymmetric relaxation occurs .",
    "this can be seen in the structure model of fig .",
    "[ fxmol ] . in this geometry atom si@xmath25 has moved towards the vacancy by about 20 % of the pristine unrelaxed bond length , whereas si@xmath1 has moved away from the vacancy by about 3 % .",
    "the tetrahedron centered on si@xmath25 remains essentially undistorted , while that centered on si@xmath1 is distorded concurrently with the neighboring tetrahedron centered on a third si atom , si@xmath26 .",
    "this effect is due to a large displacement of the bridging o atom . due to the large relaxation energy gain and to the associated electronic rehybridization ( visible in fig .",
    "[ f4rho-2 ] , where the relevant charge density isosurfaces are displayed ) , the @xmath24 state is lower in energy than the @xmath23 ( fig.[f1eform ] ) over most of the e@xmath27 range , despite the electron - electron repulsion .",
    "thus a negative - u effect takes place .",
    "the 2 state becomes favored over the neutral at a fermi level of 5.5 ev .    at a fermi level about 0.2 ev",
    "higher the @xmath20 state charge becomes favored .",
    "si@xmath25 moves towards the vacancy site by an additional 7 % ( its distance from the vacancy is about 30 % shorther than the unrelaxed bond length ) , while si@xmath1 moves closer by 2 % ( its distance from the vacancy is about 1 % longer than the unrelaxed bond length ) .",
    "the stability of the @xmath20 state over the @xmath24 state for a wide range of e@xmath27 is somewhat puzzling in view of the large repulsion to be expected among electrons in the center .",
    "the prominent feature of this state is indeed that the additional electron minimizes the coulomb repulsion with the preextant ones by occupying a state in the interstice between the vacancy - adjacent si@xmath25 and si@xmath1 atoms , and the si@xmath26 atom belonging to the tetrahedron neighboring to si@xmath1 and closest to the vacancy .",
    "the distance between si@xmath1 and si@xmath26 is reduced to only 4.3 a.u .",
    ", to be compared with a distance of 5.8 a.u . in the unrelaxed structure .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned distortion of the si@xmath1-o - si@xmath26 bridge linking the two tetrahedral units , whereby the corresponding angle decreases from the usual 144@xmath6 to only about 80@xmath6 .",
    "while this distortion is in fact already qualitatively present in the @xmath24 charge state , the additional electron in the @xmath20 state is effectively bound by si@xmath26 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f5rho-3 ] . in view of its electronic structure",
    ", the 3 charge state may be a candidate e@xmath22-like center ( see below ) .",
    "the @xmath20 state is stable up to extreme @xmath5-type conditions ( fermi level @xmath7 8.1 ev ) , whereby the @xmath28 state sets in .",
    "the fourth electron fills in the state whose occupation was initiated with q=3 , with marginal additional relaxation .",
    "the charge density and geometry are very close to the q=3 .    by the time one gets to extreme @xmath4 or @xmath5-type conditions ,",
    "the formation energies of the vacancy become very small .",
    "vacancy - driven compensation of acceptor and donor impurities will be very efficient , and we expect that @xmath5-type doping of quartz will only be achieved with extreme difficulty , if at all .",
    "the franck - condon ( fc ) shift @xmath29@xmath30 is defined as the total energy difference between the system in charge state @xmath2 in its own equilibrium configuration and the same system in the equilibrium configuration of charge state @xmath31 : @xmath32   - e_{\\rm tot}^q [ { \\bf r}_{q}]\\ , .\\ ] ] the fc shift is symmetric upon exchange of @xmath2 and @xmath31 if the dependence of the total energy on configurational coordinates is quadratic and with identical force constants in the two charge states .",
    "however , given the large distortions involved in the present case , the fc shift might be asymmetric ( expecially for large shifts ) both because of anharmonicity and of force - constant differences .",
    "these expectations are indeed verified in our calculations .",
    "we find large asymmetries for large shifts , which are consistent with force constants differing by factors of up to about @xmath33 assuming a single quadratic configurational cooordinate .",
    "we express for convenience the fc shifts between the non - positive ( non - negative ) charge states as a matrix @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) whose elements @xmath29@xmath36 ( @xmath29@xmath37 ) are the fc shifts for the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) state in the geometry of the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) state ; this matrix would be symmetric in the symmetric - fc hypotesis , and its diagonal elements are null . for negative states , with @xmath2 between 0 and 3 , we have @xmath42 while for positively charged states ( @xmath2 between 0 and + 3 ) we have @xmath43 all energies being expressed in ev .",
    "note that only the @xmath29@xmath44 elements are needed in the discussion to follow .",
    "the optical transition energy is the total energy difference of the two ( differently charged ) initial and final systems in a fixed geometry . alternatively",
    "( but equivalently ) , optical levels can be expressed as combinations of thermal levels and fc shifts .",
    "we only consider one - electron ( i.e. first - order ) processes .",
    "this kind of process amounts to transferring only one electron at a time into , or out of , a defect level .",
    "the transitions we consider are absorption ( an electron is transferred from the valence states reservoir into the defect , or transferred from the defect to the conduction band via an internal excitation of e.g. the 3 state into the 2 state ) , recombination ( the electron drops into the defect level from a reservoir of e.g. optically - excited conduction electrons ) , and single - particle deexcitation of a metastable charged center by recombination of an electron into the valence band .",
    "we assume that all processes involved , e.g. successive absorption transitions ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ... ) , take place on time scales shorter than those of lattice vibrations , so that ( e.g. ) absorption occurs in a frozen structure .",
    "this assumption seems plausible in view of typical phonon frequencies and optical transition times , especially in large excitation densities .",
    "we therefore assume that the structure remain frozen in the equilibrium configuration of a given state @xmath48 ( typically the initial state ) throughout the transition cascade .",
    "if the ground state of the defect is charge state @xmath2 , in terms of thermal levels @xmath49 $ ] and fc shifts @xmath29@xmath30 the optical absorption energy for electronic transitions from the valence band into charge state @xmath50 is @xmath51    + { \\cal{f } } _ { q-1,q_f } - { \\cal{f } } _ { q , q_f}.\\ ] ] for internal absorption excitations ( transforming e.g. @xmath24 into @xmath23 by electron excitation in the conduction band ) we have instead @xmath52    + { \\cal{f } } _ { q , q_f } - { \\cal{f } } _ { q-1,q_f}.\\ ] ] within the same assumptions , for the conduction band - to - acceptor recombination we have _ emissions _ at @xmath53 with @xmath54 ev , the experimental gap @xcite of @xmath55sio@xmath1 .",
    "once again we implicitly assumed that subsequent recombinations are instantaneous on the scale of ionic relaxation .",
    "deexcitation is slightly more complicated .",
    "suppose that the vacancies have been occupied with a number of electrons e.g. between 1 and 4 .",
    "assume further that the lifetimes of each charge states are larger than the inverse of typical phonon frequencies ( @xmath7 10 thz ) .",
    "this assumption seems again admissible in view of typical decay constants of observed luminescence bands in silica @xcite being of order 10@xmath56 to 10@xmath57 sec .",
    "then , each charge state can relax to its own ground state before deexcitation . for each vacancy in a given charge state ,",
    "a cascade of deexcitation processes occurs , whereby each charge state ( between the initial one , say @xmath58 , to @xmath21 ) is occupied in sequence , and it loses one electron to the valence band while in _ its own _ equilibrium geometry . expressing again total - energy differences in terms of thermal levels and fc shifts , we obtain the dexcitation emission energies from charge state @xmath2 as @xmath59   - { \\cal{f } } _ { q , q-1}.\\ ] ] for internal deexcitation the formula reads @xmath60   + { \\cal{f } } _ { q-1,q}.\\ ] ] here",
    "we did not consider selection rules possibly preventing some of the transitions involved , and remain with an open question on this issue .",
    "as mentioned above , quantitative predictions depend on which ground state is actually realized .",
    "this makes the optical properties of this system quite rich and complex . in table",
    "i we summarize the main groups of absorption and emission transitions involving different ground states .",
    "if the fermi level is at mid - gap ( i.e. the solid is undoped ) , the ground state is the neutral state . in moderate @xmath5-type conditions",
    ", the ground state will typically be the 3 state .",
    "the relevant thermal levels are @xmath61 $ ] = 6.24 ev , @xmath62 $ ] = 5.47 ev , and @xmath63 $ ] = 5.82 ev .",
    "the fc shifts have been given previously .",
    "in @xmath4-type conditions , the ground state will be the + 3 state .",
    "the relevant thermal levels are @xmath64 $ ] = 2.48 ev , @xmath65 $ ] = 2.69 ev , and @xmath66 $ ] = 0.72 ev ( the fc shifts have been given previously ) .    for the neutral state , the absorption band",
    "is centered around 6.6 ev and the emission band at about 2.3 ev .",
    "for the 2 charge state there is an absorption band at about 6.3 ev , while the emission one is centered around 3.0 ev . for the @xmath20 state",
    ", the absorption bands are located around 3.2 ev , 6.0 ev , and 7.1 ev .",
    "these correspond to internal excitations @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 respectively . while calculated line intensities are not available , we speculate that the latter components may give rise to a band centered around 6.3 ev , close to an experimentally observed absorption band ( 6.2 ev ) usually assumed to be related to the e@xmath22 center .    on the other hand ,",
    "the emission bands are around 2.7 ev , close to the 2.7/2.8 ev emission band generally attributed to the oxygen vacancy , and at 3.2 ev , where a band is also observed experimentally in silica . for the @xmath70 state , absorptions",
    "( either normal or internal ) are predicted at 2.2 ev , 3.1 ev and 5.0 ev , while emissions are at 1.9 ev and 0.9 ev .",
    "we note at this point that the triply - negative charge state of the oxygen vacancy exhibits several of the characteristic features of the e@xmath22 center @xcite in @xmath0-quartz .",
    "both the transition generating the center ( if the starting ground state is the neutral vacancy ) and that characteristic of the center itself are correctly predicted around 6 ev .",
    "while such transition energies appear also in the predicted spectra of other possible ground states , only the electronic structure of the @xmath2=3 state seems compatible with hyperfine - field and epr measurements @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate the presence of two weak hyperfine interactions and a strong one associated with the oxygen vacancy . in our 3 state the weak signals",
    "can be attributed to si@xmath25 and si@xmath1 , while the strong signal comes from the unpaired electron prevailingly bound to si@xmath26 .",
    "such attributions could not be made for the @xmath2=+3 , 0 , and 2 ground states .",
    "the unpaired electron lobe is approximately directed along the direction of the `` short bond '' @xcite in the ideal structure , and as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fxmol ] , si@xmath26 is close to three fold coordinated , as it is generally accepted that e@xmath22 should be @xcite .",
    "the main objection to identifying the @xmath2=3 state of the vacancy with e@xmath22 comes from experiments showing that e@xmath22 is positively charged in mos si - sio@xmath1 junctions @xcite .",
    "however , this result is not always reproduced in other instances @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze further these experiments in the light of our results , taking into account for instance band offset effects at the si / sio@xmath1 interface .",
    "as to magnetic data , recent calculations @xcite of the hyperfine tensor of a distorted variant of the singly positive vacancy have resulted in good agreement with the data pertaining to the e@xmath22 center @xcite , giving support to the attribution of e@xmath22 to a positive charge state of the vacancy . on the other hand",
    "our results indicate that the @xmath2=+1 vacancy is unstable towards becoming triply charged , and that the @xmath2=+3 state appears to be a valence resonance , lacking features which could explain the peculiar magnetic signature of e@xmath22 .",
    "it is clear that additional work is needed to resolve this puzzle .",
    "nevertheless , the 3 oxygen vacancy seems to carry several e@xmath22-like features , and it may be considered as a possible new variety of e@xmath22 defect .",
    "we have presented ab initio results on oxygen vacancies in @xmath55sio@xmath1 .",
    "the ground states for the vacancy as function of background doping are the triply - charged positive , neutral , and triply - charged negative states .",
    "the high - charge states are stabilized by large , asymmetric distortions involving at least three tetrahedral units neighboring to the vacancy . in connection with the possible different ground states we predict optical absorption energies in the 3.2 ev and 6 - 7 ev ranges , and emissions in the 2.3 - 3.2 ev range .",
    "based on predicted optical transitions , geometry , and electronic structure , we suggested a possible new e@xmath22-like center , namely the triply - charged negative oxygen vacancy .",
