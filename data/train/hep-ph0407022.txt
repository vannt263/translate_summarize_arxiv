    "the electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter at the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) @xcite has recently been equipped with a new nanosecond - resolution timing system , emtiming  @xcite , to measure the arrival time of energy deposited ( e.g. from photons ) .",
    "while it was initially designed to reject cosmics and accelerator backgrounds @xcite , we investigate the possibility of using it to search for neutral particles  @xcite with a lifetime of the order of a nanosecond which decay in flight to photons .",
    "an example of a theory which would produce these particles is the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) model @xcite with a neutralino , @xmath4 , as the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) and a light gravitino , @xmath5 , as the lsp . with a macroscopic lifetime for much of the gmsb parameter space .",
    "we begin with a study of the properties of events where timing can be used to separate between decay photons from long - lived particles , and photons produced promptly at the collision . a suitable variable to describe this distinction is the measured difference between the time after which the photon arrives at the face of the detector , and the time a prompt photon would virtually need to reach the same final position .",
    "this time difference for a prompt photon , from standard model ( sm ) sources , is exactly 0 but is always greater than  0 for photons from delayed decays , as in gmsb / supersymmetry , if we neglect the measurement resolution .",
    "we call this difference @xmath6 :    @xmath7  [ cap : explanation - of - delta ]    an important note in our analysis is that photons from long - lived particles will usually not arrive at the face of the em calorimeter at the usual 90 degree incident angle",
    ". this could have serious implications for photon identification .",
    "for the purposes of this study we assume that this issue can be addressed without significant changes to the identification efficiency .",
    "we further assume that the additional handles such as emtiming and timing in the hadronic calorimeters provide the necessary robustness needed to convince ourselves that photons which might not pass ordinary selection requirements are indeed from our signal source as opposed to sources which could produce fake photons and missing transverse energy , @xmath8 , like cosmics .",
    "we estimate our sensitivity to two different types of new particle production using gmsb models . as a quasi - model - independent sensitivity estimate to generic long - lived particles",
    "we simulate direct neutralino pair production and decay , and examine the dependency as a function of both neutralino mass , @xmath9 , and lifetime , @xmath10 . for a `` full '' gmsb model sensitivity , which means including all relevant gmsb subprocesses such that the neutralinos are part of cascades from gauginos and squarks , we allow all susy particle production and decay , and again vary the mass and lifetime variables . to choose analysis final states for both we consider three issues : 1 ) with neutralino lifetimes longer than a nanosecond it is possible that one or both of the neutralinos leave the detector before they decay , 2 ) with gravitinos or the neutralino leaving the detector @xmath8 should also help separate signal from sm backgrounds and 3 ) to ensure that our predictions are as reliable as possible we want to use the data selection requirements and background predictions from previously published papers by cdf  @xcite and d  @xcite . in the 1992 - 1995 collider run (",

    "we quantify the sensitivity for 2  fb@xmath13 in run  ii using the expected 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "cross section upper limits .",
    "results for both with and without the emtiming system , using kinematics cuts only , illustrate the contribution to the final sensitivity from kinematic and timing information considerations  @xcite .",
    "finally , we compare the final mass and lifetime exclusion regions for a gmsb scenario to direct and indirect searches from the aleph experiment  @xcite at lep  ii and the theoretically favored parameter space from cosmological model restrictions of @xmath1  @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "while the final sensitivity studies use both a full physics generation and a detector simulation of the geometry and timing resolution , we begin with a study of the kinematic properties of events which yield large @xmath6 measurements using a `` toy monte carlo . '' for now the cdf detector is assumed to be a cylinder , with length 3.5  m and radius 1.7  m , instrumented with time and position detectors of perfect resolution for both the collision point and where the photon hits the face of the detector .",
    "neutral particles , which we will refer to as neutralinos , are simulated as emanating isotropically from the center of the detector and emit a photon isotropically after a lifetime @xmath10 in their rest frame . for a promptly decaying photon the minimum time corresponds to the nearest distance to the detector face : @xmath14  =  5.6  ns ; the maximum to the largest distance @xmath15  =  8.1  ns . for pedagogic reasons , neutralinos are simulated with a flat momentum and lifetime distribution , i.e. independently any lifetime and momentum have equal probability .",
    "we note that to be conservative here , as later in the paper , only those neutralinos that decay before the face of the detector are considered to have produced a photon .",
    "figure  [ cap : delta - s-(ns ) ] shows the measured    next we consider the efficiency for neutralinos to remain in the detector and/or produce a photon with large @xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ cap : efficiency - vs .- tau ] shows the efficiency , the fraction of all generated events that produce photons which pass a given @xmath6 restriction , as a function of the event lifetime , @xmath16 , for @xmath17  0 ( neutralino stays in the detector ) ,  3  ns and 5  ns for the same production distribution .",
    "@xmath16 the efficiency is 100% and the efficiency decreases with higher event lifetime , since the neutralinos are more likely to leave the detector .",
    "when one applies a @xmath6 cut however , there is no efficiency for events that contain neutralinos with a low event lifetime ( @xmath18  2  ns ) .",
    "@xmath16 so , if an event contains a neutralino with a long lifetime and which decays in the detector , the decay photon always has high",
    "here we estimate our sensitivity to neutral , long - lived particles which decay to photons in as model - independent a manner as possible .",
    "we do so by considering a gmsb model  @xcite which we restrict to direct neutralino pair production and decay : @xmath19 .",
    "we use the  @xcite event generator , with  @xcite to generate the susy masses , and pgs with the parameter file for the cdf detector  @xcite as a simple detector simulation , modified for the use of timing information .",
    "we first look at the efficiency of the timing system with infinite resolution as a function of neutralino mass and lifetime for different @xmath6 restrictions .",
    "then we discuss background estimations , take into account a timing resolution of 1.0  ns and find the sensitivities for the model predictions for both the single and diphoton analysis .",
    "figure  [ cap2:efficiency - vs .- tau ] shows the efficiency for a mass of  70  @xmath3  @xcite single and diphoton events for all four distributions there is an efficiency maximum in the lifetime region between 4 and 9  ns . at lower lifetimes the probability that the neutralino stays in the detector is large enough that the diphoton final state dominates .",
    "@xmath10 . at a lifetime of about 3  ns ,",
    "independent of the single photon events become dominant .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath8    in contrast the timing efficiency is essentially constant as a function of neutralino mass at a fixed lifetime .",
    "figure  [ cap : efficiency - vs .- m_n1 ] shows the efficiencies at @xmath20  ns , where the system has the highest efficiency and single photon events dominate .",
    "note that the `` dip '' in the efficiency can be explained by the neutralino pair production mechanism : if the decay length is greater than the distance to the detector wall , the neutralino will leave .",
    "since this is proportional to the ratio of the neutralino s transverse momentum to its mass , @xmath21 , ( at constant lifetime ) , the dip occurs from a change in the shape of the @xmath21 distribution of the neutralinos as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : neutralino - p_t ] . for a mass of 80  @xmath3  the maximum moves towards higher @xmath21 and the distribution",
    "broadens compared to 40  @xmath3 , yielding a greater fraction of high-@xmath22 neutralinos and hence a loss in efficiency .",
    "as the mass gets higher the maximum remains the same and the distribution narrows , which in turn leads to a gain in efficiency .",
    "thus , the efficiency is essentially independent of the neutralino mass , with slight variations originating from the production mechanism , specifically the neutralino momentum distribution .",
    "we now estimate the sensitivity of our system in a quasi - model - independent manner using the neutralino pair production introduced in the previous section , but taking into account sm backgrounds , more realistic cuts and the timing resolution .",
    "we consider separately single photon and diphoton events and present our sensitivity as the expected 95%  c.l .",

    "we also compare our results with the results of no emtiming system available to estimate the effect of the emtiming system over a set of kinematics - only selection requirements . throughout this section",
    "we use the relative systematic uncertainties for luminosity , acceptance and background rates given in table  [ cap : errors ] and a @xmath6 resolution of 1.0  ns .",
    "the expected cross section limits are calculated following @xcite with the number of events observed `` in the data '' fluctuating around an expected mean background rate according to poisson statistics .",

    "photon pointing method  @xcite . in this section",
    "we compare the emtiming system to a potential photon pointing ability at cdf .",
    "a non - zero lifetime can result in a macroscopic decay length and impact parameter , where the impact parameter of the photon is basically the closest distance of the trajectory to the collision point .",
    "while cdf has never used its calorimeter for a pointing measurement it is possible to use the central em strip / wire gas chamber ( ces ) and the central pre - radiator gas chamber ( cpr ) at cdf to measure two points along the photon trajectories that determine the direction of the photon , and trace it back to yield the impact parameter  @xcite . since the cpr has no @xmath39-measurement ability this allows only a measurement of the radial component of the impact parameter with an estimated resolution of 10  cm ( see table [ cap : pointingerrors ] ) .",
    "one of the primary reasons this has not been used is the conversion , i.e. measurement , probability , of @xmath4065% , with an angular dependence obtained with : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of radiation lengths before the cpr and @xmath43 is the angle with respect to the beamline . to estimate the sensitivity with a pointing method we consider @xmath12  +  @xmath8  +  jets analysis .",
    "figure  [ cap : sig - b - deltas ] shows the distribution of the signal events vs. impact parameter and @xmath6 in a @xmath12  +  @xmath8  +  jets analysis taking into account the measurement probability ; there are roughly as many events in the region of low impact parameter and high @xmath6 as there are at high impact parameter and low @xmath6 .",
    "hence either method should have roughly the same effect on the exclusion region , as confirmed by fig .",
    "[ cap : xsecmin - gmsb-2000lumi - pointing ] , which shows the expected exclusion region in the mass - lifetime plane .",
    "while timing is better than pointing by itself , if pointing turns out to be feasible , a combination of the two would improve the sensitivity .",
    "considered separately , a second advantage of timing is that it `` filters '' manifestly long lifetime events , whereas the impact parameter allows also short lifetime - high momentum events , which might come from sm .",
    "another possible advantage of the combination is that in the event of an excess , we could draw more information about the individual events , for instance determine the direction of the photon . with the @xmath23-@xmath24-direction being fixed by the cpr / ces measurement",
    ", we can use the timing system to measure the @xmath39-direction . or",
    "if the pointing provided the photon direction in @xmath39 and @xmath23-@xmath24 , one could possibly determine the position of the vertex and thus the decay time .",
    "however , with the current 1.0  ns resolution the photon vertex position resolution would be roughly 50  cm , if we assume the neutralino boost to be @xmath44 .",
