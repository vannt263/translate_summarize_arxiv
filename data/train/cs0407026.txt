    "term descriptions , which have been carefully organized in hand - crafted encyclopedias , are valuable linguistic knowledge for human usage and computational linguistics research . however ,",
    "due to the limitation of manual compilation , existing encyclopedias often lack new terms and new definitions for existing terms .    the world wide web ( the web ) , which contains an enormous volume of up - to - date information , is a promising source to obtain new term descriptions .",
    "it has become fairly common to consult the web for descriptions of a specific term . however , the use of existing search engines is associated with the following problems :    1 .",
    "search engines often retrieve extraneous pages not describing a submitted term , 2 .",
    "even if desired pages are retrieved , a user has to identify page fragments describing the term , 3 .",
    "word senses are not distinguished for polysemous terms , such as `` hub ( device and center ) '' , 4 .",
    "descriptions in multiple pages are independent and do not comprise a condensed and coherent text as in existing encyclopedias .",
    "the authors of this paper have been resolving these problems progressively . for problems ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", fujii and ishikawa   proposed an automatic method to extract term descriptions from the web .",
    "for problem ( c ) , fujii and ishikawa   improved the previous method , so that the multiple descriptions extracted for a single term are categorized into domains and consequently word senses are distinguished .    using these methods ,",
    "we have compiled an encyclopedic corpus for approximately 600,000 japanese terms .",
    "we have also built a web site called `` cyclone '' to utilize this corpus , in which one or more paragraph - style descriptions extracted from different pages can be retrieved in response to a user input . in figure",
    "[ fig : xml ] , three paragraphs describing `` xml '' are presented with the titles of their source pages .",
    "however , the above - mentioned problem ( d ) remains unresolved and this is exactly what we intend to address in this paper .    in hand - crafted encyclopedias ,",
    "a single term is described concisely from different `` viewpoints '' , such as the definition , exemplification , and purpose .",
    "in contrast , if the first paragraph in figure  [ fig : xml ] is not described from a sufficient number of viewpoints for xml , a user has to read remaining paragraphs .",
    "however , this is inefficient , because the descriptions are extracted from independent pages and usually include redundant contents .    to resolve this problem",
    ", we propose a summarization method that produces a concise and condensed term description from multiple paragraphs . as a result ,",
    "a user can obtain sufficient information about a term with a minimal cost .",
    "additionally , by reducing the size of descriptions , cyclone can be used with mobile devices , such as pdas .",
    "however , while cyclone includes various types of terms , such as technical terms , events , and animals , the required set of viewpoints can vary depending the type of target terms .",
    "for example , the definition and exemplification are necessary for technical terms , but the family and habitat are necessary for animals . in this paper , we target japanese technical terms in the computer domain .",
    "section  [ sec : cyclone ] outlines cyclone .",
    "sections  [ sec : method ] and [ sec : eval ] explain our summarization method and its evaluation , respectively . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss related work and the scalability of our method .",
    "figure  [ fig : cyclone ] depicts the overall design of cyclone , which produces an encyclopedic corpus by means of five modules : `` term recognition '' , `` extraction '' , `` retrieval '' , `` organization '' , and `` related term extraction '' .",
    "while cyclone produces a corpus off - line , users search the resultant corpus for specific descriptions on - line .",
    "it should be noted that the summarization method proposed in this paper is not included in figure  [ fig : cyclone ] and that the concept of viewpoint has not been used in the modules in figure  [ fig : cyclone ] .    in the off - line process",
    ", the input terms can be either submitted manually or collected by the term recognition module automatically .",
    "the term recognition module periodically searches the web for morpheme sequences not included in the corpus , which are used as input terms .",
    "the retrieval module exhaustively searches the web for pages including an input term , as performed in existing web search engines .",
    "the extraction module analyzes the layout ( i.e. , the structure of html tags ) of each retrieved page and identifies the paragraphs that potentially describe the target term .",
    "while promising descriptions can be extracted from pages resembling on - line dictionaries , descriptions can also be extracted from general pages .",
    "the organization module classifies the multiple paragraphs for a single term into predefined domains ( e.g. , computers , medicine , and sports ) and sorts them according to the score .",
    "the score is computed by the reliability determined by hyper - links as in google and the linguistic validity determined by a language model produced from an existing machine - readable encyclopedia .",
    "thus , different word senses , which are often associated with different domains , can be distinguished and high - quality descriptions can be selected for each domain .    finally , the related term extraction module searches top - ranked descriptions for terms strongly related to the target term ( e.g. , `` cable '' and `` lan '' for `` hub '' ) . existing encyclopedias often provide related terms for each headword , which are effective to understand the headword . in cyclone , related terms can also be used as feedback terms to narrow down the user focus . however",
    ", this module is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "given a set of paragraph - style descriptions for a single term in a specific domain ( e.g. , descriptions for `` hub '' in the computer domain ) , our summarization method produces a concise text describing the term from different viewpoints .",
    "these descriptions are obtained by the organization module in figure  [ fig : cyclone ] .",
    "thus , the related term extraction module is independent of our summarization method .",
    "our method is multi - document summarization ( mds ) @xcite .",
    "because a set of input documents ( in our case , the paragraphs for a single term ) were written by different authors and/or different time , the redundancy and divergence of the topics in the input are greater than that for single document summarization .",
    "thus , the recognition of similarity and difference among multiple contents is crucial .",
    "the following two questions have to be answered :    * by which language unit ( e.g. , words , phrases , or sentences ) should two contents be compared ? * by which criterion should two contents be regarded as `` similar '' or `` different '' ?",
    "the answers for these questions can be different depending on the application and the type of input documents .",
    "our purpose is to include as many viewpoints as possible in a concise description .",
    "thus , we compare two contents on a viewpoint - by - viewpoint basis . in addition , if two contents are associated with the same viewpoint , we determine that those contents are similar and that they should not be repeated in the summary .",
    "our viewpoint - based summarization ( vbs ) method consists of the following four steps :    1 .",
    "identification , which recognizes the language unit associated with a viewpoint , 2 .",
    "classification , which merges the identified units associated with the same viewpoint into a single group , 3 .",
    "selection , which determines one or more representative units for each group , 4 .",
    "presentation , which produces a summary in a specific format .",
    "the model is similar to those in existing mds methods .",
    "however , the implementation of each step varies depending on the application .",
    "we elaborate on the four steps in sections  [ subsec : identification]-[subsec : presentation ] , respectively .",
    "the identification module recognizes the language units , each of which describes a target term from a specific viewpoint .",
    "however , a compound or complex sentence is often associated with multiple viewpoints .",
    "the following example is an english translation of a japanese compound sentence in a web page .    _",

    "it should be noted that because `` xml '' and `` extensible markup language '' are spelled out by the roman alphabet in the original sentence , the first clause does not provide japanese readers with the definition of xml .    to extract the language units on a viewpoint - by - viewpoint basis",
    ", we segment japanese sentences into simple sentences .",
    "however , sentence segmentation remains a difficult problem and the accuracy is not 100% .",
    "first , we analyze the syntactic dependency structure of an input sentence by cabocha .",
    "second , we use hand - crafted rules to extract simple sentences using the dependency structure .    the simple sentences excepting the first clause often lack the subject . to resolve this problem , zero pronoun detection and anaphora resolution can be used .",
    "however , due to the rudimentary nature of existing methods , we use hand - crafted rules to complement simple sentences with the subject .    as a result , we can obtain the following two simple sentences from the above - mentioned input sentence , in which the complement subject is in parentheses .",

    "these patterns are regular expressions , in which specific morphemes are generalized into parts - of - speech or the special symbol representing the target term .",
    "we use a two - stage classification method .",
    "first , the simple sentences that match with a pattern are classified into the associated viewpoint group .",
    "a simple sentence that matches with patterns for multiple viewpoints is classified into every possible group .",
    "however , the pattern - based method fails to classify the sentences that do not match with any predefined patterns .",
    "thus , second we classify the remaining sentences into the group in which the most similar sentence has already been classified . in practice ,",
    "we compute the similarity between an unclassified sentence and each of the classified sentences .",
    "the similarity between two sentences is determined by the dice coefficient , i.e. , the ratio of content words commonly included in those sentences .",
    "the sentences unclassified through the above method are classified into the `` miscellaneous '' group .",
    "in summary , our two - stage method uses predefined linguistic patterns and statistics of words .",
    "the following examples are english translations of japanese sentences extracted in the identification module .",
    "these sentences can be classified into a specific group on the ground of the underlined expressions , excepting sentence ( e ) .",

    "because these factors are different in terms of the dimension , range , and polarity , we normalize each factor in [ 0,1 ] and compute the final score as a weighed average of the three factors .",
    "the weight of each factor was determined by a preliminary study . in brief ,",
    "the relative importance among the three factors is w@xmath4r@xmath4c .",
    "however , because the miscellaneous group includes various viewpoints , we use a different method from that for the regular groups .",
    "first , we select representative sentences from the regular groups .",
    "second , from the miscellaneous group , we select the sentence that is most dissimilar to the sentences already selected as representatives .",
    "we use the dice - based similarity used in section  [ subsec : classification ] to measure the dissimilarity between two sentences .",

    "although the resultant summary describes xml from multiple viewpoints , there is a room for improvement . for example , the sentences classified into the definition and abbreviation viewpoints include almost the same content .",
    "existing methods for evaluating summarization techniques can be classified into intrinsic and extrinsic approaches .    in the intrinsic approach ,",
    "the content of a summary is evaluated with respect to the quality of a text ( e.g. , coherence ) and the informativeness ( i.e. , the extent to which important contents are in the summary ) . in the extrinsic approach , the evaluation measure is the extent to which a summary improves the efficiency of a specific task ( e.g. , relevance judgment in text retrieval ) .    in duc and ntcir ,",
    "both approaches have been used to evaluate summarization methods targeting newspaper articles . however , because there was no public test collections targeting term descriptions in web pages , we produced our test collection .",
    "as the first step of our summarization research , we addressed only the intrinsic evaluation .    in this paper , we focused on including as many viewpoints ( i.e. , contents ) as possible in a summary , but did not address the text coherence",
    ". thus , we used the informativeness of a summary as the evaluation criterion .",
    "we used the following two measures , which are in the trade - off relation .",
    "* compression ratio + @xmath6 * coverage + @xmath7    here , `` # viewpoints '' denotes the number of viewpoint _ types_. even if a summary contains multiple sentences related to the same viewpoint , the numerator is increased by 1 .",
    "we used 15 japanese term in an existing computer dictionary as test inputs .",
    "english translations of the test inputs are as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 10base - t , ascii , sql , xml , accumulator , assembler , binary number , crossing cable , data warehouse , macro virus , main memory unit , parallel processing , resolution , search time , thesaurus .",

    "to reduce the subjectivity in the evaluation , for each of the 15 terms , we asked two college students ( excluding the authors of this paper ) to annotate each simple sentence in the top 50 paragraphs with one or more viewpoints .",
    "the two annotators performed the annotation task independently .",
    "the denominators of the compression ratio and coverage were calculated by the top 50 paragraphs .    during a preliminary study ,",
    "the authors and annotators defined 28 viewpoints , including the 12 viewpoints targeted in our method .",
    "we also defined the following three categories , which were not considered as a viewpoint :    * non - description , which were also used to annotate non - sentence fragments caused by errors in the identification module , * description for a word sense independent of the computer domain ( e.g. , `` hub '' as a center , instead of a network device ) , * miscellaneous .",
    "it may be argued that an existing hand - crafted encyclopedia can be used as the standard summary .",
    "however , paragraphs in cyclone often contain viewpoints not described in existing encyclopedias .",
    "thus , we did not use existing encyclopedias in our experiments .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] shows the compression ratio and coverage for different methods , in which `` # reps '' and `` # chars '' denote the number of representative sentences selected from each viewpoint group and the number of characters in a summary , respectively .",
    "we always selected five sentences from the miscellaneous group .",
    "the third column denotes the compression ratio .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : results ]    the remaining columns denote the coverage on a annotator - by - annotator basis .",
    "the columns `` 12 viewpoints '' and `` 28 viewpoints '' denote the case in which we focused only on the 12 viewpoints targeted in our method and the case in which all the 28 viewpoints were considered , respectively .",
    "the columns `` vbs '' and `` lead '' denote the coverage obtained with our viewpoint - based summarization method and the lead method .",
    "the lead method , which has often been used as a baseline method in past literature , systematically extracted the top @xmath8 characters from the cyclone result .",
    "here , @xmath8 is the same number in the second column .    in other words ,",
    "the compression ratio of the vbs and lead methods was standardized , and we compared the coverage of both methods .",
    "the compression ratio and coverage were averaged over the 15 test terms .",
    "suggestions which can be derived from table  [ tab : results ] are as follows .",
    "first , in the case of `` # reps=1 '' , the average size of a summary was 616 characters , which is marginally longer than an abstract for a technical paper . in the case of `` # reps=3 '' , the average summary size was 1309 characters , which is almost the maximum size for a single description in hand - crafted encyclopedias . a summary obtained with four sentences in each group",
    "is perhaps too long as term descriptions .",
    "second , the compression ratio was roughly 10% , which is fairly good performance .",
    "it may be argued that the compression ratio is exaggerated .",
    "that is , although paragraphs ranked higher than 50 can potentially provide the sufficient viewpoints , the top 50 paragraphs were always used to calculate the dominator of the compression ratio .",
    "we found that the top 38 paragraphs , on average , contained all viewpoint types in the top 50 paragraphs .",
    "thus , the remaining 12 paragraphs did not provide additional information .",
    "however , it is difficult for a user to determine when to stop reading a retrieval result . in existing evaluation workshops , such as ntcir , the compression ratio is also calculated using the total size of the input documents",
    ".    third , the vbs method outperformed the lead method in terms of the coverage , excepting the case of `` # reps=1 '' focusing on the 12 viewpoints by annotator b. however , in general the vbs method produced more informative summaries than the lead method , irrespective of the compression ratio and the annotator .",
    "it should be noted that although the vbs method targets 12 viewpoints , the sentences selected from the miscellaneous group can be related to the remaining 16 viewpoints .",
    "thus , even if we focus on the 28 viewpoints , the coverage of the vbs method can potentially increase .",
    "it should also be noted that all viewpoints are not equally important .",
    "for example , in an existing encyclopedia  @xcite the definition , exemplification , and synonym are regarded as the obligatory viewpoints , and the remaining viewpoints are optional .",
    "we investigated the coverage for the three obligatory viewpoints .",
    "we found that while the coverage for the definition and exemplification ranged from 60% to 90% , the coverage for the synonym was 50% or less .",
    "a low coverage for the synonym is partially due to the fact that synonyms are often described with parentheses .",
    "however , because parentheses are used for various purposes , it is difficult to identify only synonyms expressed with parentheses .",
    "this problem needs to be further explored .",
    "the goal of our research is to automatically compile a high - quality large encyclopedic corpus using the web .",
    "hand - crafted encyclopedias lack new terms and new definitions for existing terms , and thus the quantity problem is crucial .",
    "the web contains unreliable and unorganized information and thus the quality problem is crucial . we intend to alleviate both problems . to the best of our knowledge , no attempt has been made to intend similar purposes .",
    "our research is related to question answering ( qa ) .",
    "for example , in trec qa track , definition questions are intended to provide a user with the definition of a target item or person  @xcite . however , while the expected answer for a trec question is short definition sentences as in a dictionary , we intend to produce an encyclopedic text describing a target term from multiple viewpoints .",
    "the summarization method proposed in this paper is related to multi - document summarization ( mds ) @xcite .",
    "the novelty of our research is that we applied mds to producing a condensed term description from unorganized web pages , while existing mds methods used newspaper articles to produce an outline of an event and a biography of a specific person .",
    "we also proposed the concept of viewpoint for mds purposes .    while we targeted japanese technical terms in the computer domain , our method",
    "can also be applied to other types of terms in different languages , without modifying the model .",
    "however , a set of viewpoints and patterns typically used to describe each viewpoint need to be modified or replaced depending the application . given annotated data , such as those used in our experiments , machine learning methods can potentially be used to produce a set of viewpoints and patterns for a specific application .",
    "to compile encyclopedic term descriptions from the web , we introduced a summarization method to our previous work .",
    "future work includes generating a coherent text instead of a simple list of sentences and performing extensive experiments including an extrinsic evaluation method .",
