    "this article is a companion article for @xcite . in that article we discussed intermittent dynamics associated with boundary crisis ( homoclinic ) bifurcations in families of unimodal maps . in the present work we treat saddle node bifurcations from the same perspective .    by jakobson",
    "s celebrated work @xcite , the logistic family @xmath0 , @xmath1 $ ] , admits absolutely continuous invariant measures ( a.c.i.m.s ) for @xmath2 from a set of positive measure .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 is a ( lebesgue or full ) density point of this set .",
    "a different argument for this result was given by benedicks and carleson @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their reasoning was generalized to unfoldings @xmath4 of unimodal misiurewicz maps @xmath5 , with eventually periodic critical point @xmath6 ( and possessing negative schwarzian derivative ) .",
    "it was shown that the bifurcation value @xmath7 is a density point of the set of parameter values for which @xmath8 admits an absolutely continuous invariant measure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we generalize these results to unfoldings of saddle - node bifurcations in families @xmath4 of unimodal maps with negative schwarzian derivative .",
    "we establish that a saddle - node bifurcation value occurs as a point of positive density of the parameter set for which there are absolutely continuous invariant measures . under the assumption that @xmath5 is not more than once renormalizable",
    ", we construct parameters for which @xmath8 possesses a.c.i.m.s supported on the maximal interval @xmath9 $ ] , see theorem  [ existence ] below .",
    "in contrast to the misiurewicz bifurcation values , the saddle - node bifurcation value is not a full density point of this parameter set .",
    "this is because it is known that the parameter set for which the map has a periodic attractor has positive density at any saddle - node .",
    "following the construction of a.c.i.m.s , we continue with a detailed discussion of the intermittency that occurs due to the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "that saddle - node bifurcations can give rise to intermittency is known since @xcite , who called intermittency associated with a saddle - node bifurcation type i intermittency .",
    "pomeau and manneville studied type i intermittency in connection with the lorenz model . in the model ,",
    "simplifying ( hyperbolicity ) assumptions on the dynamics outside a neighborhood of the saddle - node periodic orbit are made . in perhaps the most basic example of type i intermittency , in families of unimodal maps , such simplifications are not justified .",
    "this is due to the presence of a critical point .",
    "our discussion of absolutely continuous invariant measures allows us to give a rigorous treatment of intermittent time series , where we explain and prove quantitative aspects earlier discussed numerically in @xcite , see theorems  [ intermittency ] and [ saddlenode ] below .",

    "@xcite studied the unfoldings of saddle - node bifurcations in higher dimensional diffeomorphisms and their results imply in the present context that there exists a subset @xmath10 which has positive density at @xmath11 , such that for each @xmath12 , @xmath8 has an absolutely continuous invariant measure .",
    "the measures produced there are supported on small periodic domains on which the map renormalizes to a hnon - like family . in the present context",
    "this corresponds to parameter values inside periodic windows , for which @xmath8 is renormalizable .",
    "however , the invariant measures produced in jakobson s work are supported on the maximal possible interval , @xmath13 $ ] and the invariant measures that we construct are also supported on @xmath13 $ ] .    while editing the final draft of this paper , we learned of the results of maria joo costa @xcite , corresponding to part of her 1998 thesis , on related work in a similar context .",
    "she focused on the sink - horseshoe bifurcation in which a sink and a horseshoe collapse , see @xcite , and studied families @xmath14 of unimodal interval maps to describe bifurcations .",
    "the class of families of interval maps studied in @xcite differs from ours ; it consists of unfoldings of unimodal maps @xmath15 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] , that possess a saddle node fixed point at @xmath16 , so that the critical point @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 . for such families",
    "costa derived the analogue of theorem  [ existence ] below , stating that absolutely continuous invariant measures supported on the maximal interval occur with positive density at the bifurcation point .",
    "the set - up of costa s proof corresponds to ours in that she also combines arguments originating from benedicks and carleson @xcite with the introduction of induced maps , as discussed below .",

    "numerical simulations also suggest that near a saddle - node bifurcation , there is a large set of parameter values for which the a.c.i.m.s are supported on the maximal possible interval .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : quad ] .",

    "we now first consider intermittency that results from the saddle - node bifurcation and introduce our second main result .",
    "intermittent dynamics manifests itself by alternating phases with different characteristics . in one phase ,",
    "referred to as the laminar phase , the dynamics appear to be nearly periodic . while in the other phase , the relaminarization phase , the orbit makes large , seemingly chaotic excursions away from the periodic region .",
    "these excursions are called chaotic bursts .",

    "the main obstacle in the present case is the fact that when orbits fall into the saddle - node region they remain there for many iterations and the derivative of @xmath84 in that region is close to one .",
    "we get around this problem by defining an induced map which skips over the saddle - node region .",
    "we show that the induced map has uniform exponential growth of derivatives and that this implies exponential growth of derivatives ( with weaker constants ) for the original map .",
