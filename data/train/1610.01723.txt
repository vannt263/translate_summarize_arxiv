    "the internet of things ( iot ) is seen as the most promising networking technology of the coming decade @xcite . in the iot",
    ", a massive number of machine type devices ( mtds ) , such as sensors , wearables , or even mundane objects @xcite , will be endowed with large - scale wireless communication capabilities .",
    "such mtds will be critical for applications such as smart metering , smart agriculture , and healthcare .",
    "however , to enable such massive iot communication , many challenges must be overcome ranging from network modeling to resource management @xcite .",
    "first and foremost , wireless communication for the iot must take into account stringent resource constraints , massive scale , and high heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "additionally , it must satisfy strict system requirements , such as enhanced security , high reliability , and efficient resource management @xcite .",
    "+ the mtds will have different types of messages of varying characterizations , such as time sensitivity , urgency , and delay tolerance @xcite",
    ". some messages will be delay tolerant and not urgent and , thus , they will not require retransmissions or short delays . however , there also are urgent , delay intolerant messages , which require retransmissions and ultra low latency @xcite .",
    "thus , it is critical to develop reliable wireless communication protocols for the iot that can account for such message heterogeneity as well as for the stringent computational and memory constraints of the mtds .",
    "+ there are many works on designing , evaluating , and analyzing various wireless communication solutions for the mtds in an iot @xcite . some of these works , such as in @xcite , focus on improving latency , reliability , system throughput , and transmit power , which are of critical importance in an iot .",
    "other works , such as in @xcite , characterize various types of messages present in an iot . a framework for machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communication using various multiple access schemes is designed and analyzed to optimize the transmit power @xcite and to maximize the system throughput @xcite .",
    "a wireless communications system for an industrial control application that satisfies both low latency and high reliability requirements is developed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the messages used in the smart metering application are classified based on maximum latency , payload size , and frequency , and the integration of smart metering into the current wireless cellular systems is investigated .",
    "however , none of this existing body of works considers the heterogeneity in message properties and requirements while improving the performance metrics , such as latency and system throughput .",
    "moreover , works such as in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite assume mtds to have infinite computational and memory requirements and thus are able to operate similarly to classical human type devices such as smartphones .",
    "naturally , such an assumption does not hold for m2 m . + to cope with the resource limitations of mtds with respect to computational power and memory , _ sequential learning _",
    "models can be used to enable the mtds to learn to optimize their transmission parameters in a distributed manner .",
    "in particular , the authors in @xcite and @xcite introduce a finite memory sequential learning scheme using which a number of agents try to learn an underlying binary state of the world in a sequence , such as in a line , with only finite memory .",
    "this is in contrast to conventional sequential learning such as in @xcite and @xcite , which requires the agents to have a complete knowledge of other agents . in both cases",
    ", the agents will have to observe the independent , informative _",
    "private signals _ about the underlying binary state @xcite .",
    "although conventional sequential learning , which requires an infinite memory , performs better , the finite memory sequential learning is more appropriate for mtd communication .",
    "however , existing related works @xcite are tailored towards economic or social applications and thus , they can not be readily applied to an iot setting . indeed ,",
    "such works @xcite do not consider the resource constraints of mtds , the system properties of an iot , and the realistic limitations of communication system .",
    "+ the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a novel learning framework using which the mtds can learn their transmission parameters , under _ stringent memory and computational constraints_. in particular , we consider an iot system in which memory - constrained , low capability mtds can transmit both delay - tolerant , periodic messages , and real - time , critical alarm message . for this system ,",
    "the proposed framework enables the mtds to autonomously learn to adjust their transmission parameters , such as selected transmission code , for high reliability of delivering critical alarm messages .",
    "in particular , using the proposed approach , each mtd can properly learn about the presence of alarm messages with only a partial , finite knowledge of other agents .",
    "for the studied framework , we show that it can drastically mitigate the effects of limiting factors of learning , which prevent proper sequential learning in an iot .",
    "simulation results show that the delay of critical alarm message can be significantly reduced , and the number of mtds that learn the true , underlying binary state is greatly increased . in particular , the results show that the proposed learning with finite memory framework reduces the delay of urgent alarm messages up to @xmath1% with minimal memory , while reducing the system throughput by only @xmath2% . to our best knowledge",
    ", this paper is the _ first to develop a learning with finite memory framework within the context of the internet of things and machine type communications . _ + the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the system model . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the learning with finite memory framework .",
    "section iv analyzes the simulation results while section v draws conclusions .",
    "consider the uplink of a wireless iot system consisting of one base station ( bs ) located at the center of a geographical area in which @xmath3 mtds are deployed .",
    "for the communication between an mtd and the bs , we consider a time slotted system with time slot duration of @xmath4 using a code division multiple access ( cdma ) scheme with code length @xmath5 .",
    "cdma is chosen here since it has been recently shown to be promising for supporting a high iot message arrive rate in @xcite .",
    "we focus on uplink transmissions during which the mtds transmit their data to the bs using one out of a fixed number @xmath6 of binary spreading codes . as in @xcite , we assume that there is no coordination in choosing a random code and thus , the chosen codes are not necessarily orthogonal or unique . if more than one mtd use a given code , it would be impossible for the bs to distinguish the messages and thus , all transmissions using the given code will fail .",
    "a transmission is considered to be successful if it is the only mtd using a given code .",
    "furthermore , the messages transmitted to the bs are assumed to be short such that , when successful , the transmission can be completed in one period @xmath4 .",
    "the mtds are said to be _ active _ if they have a message to transmit , otherwise , they will be considered _ inactive _ and will not transmit in that given slot .",
    "+ we let @xmath7 be the random variable capturing the number of mtds that have a successful transmission in a given slot .",
    "then , for some number of active mtds @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the expected value of @xmath7 will be : @xmath10 = \\sum\\limits_{s = 1}^{s_{\\textrm{max } } } s \\pr(s = s ) \\binom{n}{s } , \\label{systhru}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the maximum number of mtds with successful transmission given @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath11 is defined as    @xmath13    since it is difficult to directly compute @xmath14 , we will first compute @xmath15 and use the fact that @xmath16 for some discrete random variable @xmath17 with sample space @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ". the probability of having at least @xmath20 mtds with successful transmission @xmath15 will be :    alignat=2 & _ j=0^s-1 ( ) ^(n - s ) &  s < c , s n , [ eq1 ] + & _ j=0^s-1 &  s = c = n , [ eq2 ] + & 0 &    is the probability that @xmath20 active mtds transmit successfully using @xmath20 codes without repetition while the remaining @xmath21 mtds transmit using the remaining @xmath22 codes , some of which may transmit successfully .",
    "accounts for the special case in which @xmath23 . using , , and",
    ", the probability of having @xmath20 mtds with successful transmission @xmath14 will be : @xmath24 where @xmath25 accounts for different combination of choosing @xmath26 active mtds , which transmit successfully , out of the remaining @xmath21 active mtds with uncertain transmissions .",
    "+ in our iot model , we consider different types of messages that the mtds can transmit .",
    "although the message types are application specific , we consider two general types of iot messages .    * _ periodic messages _ are update messages from the mtds to the bs .",
    "examples include meter readings , environment observations , and system status reports .",
    "this type of messages is delay tolerant and not of critical importance .",
    "such messages contain time sensitive data that may not be useful if outdated .",
    "therefore , retransmitting the same periodic message will not be allowed after failure .",
    "the mtds will transmit periodic messages every @xmath27 . * _ alarm messages _ are critical messages triggered by a rarely occurring abnormality .",
    "examples of alarm messages include system failure reports , fire or gas leakage , and power outages .",
    "this type of messages is highly delay intolerant and of critical importance .",
    "it is crucial to quickly notify the bs of this abnormality and thus , retransmissions are necessary .",
    "if there is an abnormality , an mtd will transmit the alarm message to the bs every @xmath4 to constantly update the status of the system .",
    "since abnormalities are rare occurrences , we assume that there will not be more than one alarm message at any given time .",
    "the time slot for the first periodic message is uniformly distributed over the set @xmath28 such that approximately an equal number of mtds will transmit the periodic messages in any given time slot .",
    "therefore , the expected number of active mtds in a given time slot is @xmath29 .",
    "if an mtd has an alarm message , the probability of successful transmission @xmath30 for the mtd given that there are @xmath31 other mtds possibly with periodic messages will be : @xmath32 in our model , delay is defined as the time taken until the first successful transmission and thus , the random variable @xmath33 for delay can be modeled as a geometric random variable with parameter @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the expected value of delay @xmath33 until the bs is first notified of an abnormality via an alarm message will be : @xmath34 = \\left(\\frac{c}{c-1}\\right)^{\\frac{(n-1)}{t}}. \\label{delay}\\ ] ] as the number of mtds , @xmath3 , increases , the probability of successful transmission @xmath30 decreases and the expected delay @xmath35 $ ] increases exponentially .",
    "therefore , in a massive - scale iot in which @xmath3 is very large , the expected delay for alarm messages will be very high , which is inacceptable for the urgent , alarm messages , as it will lead to detrimental effects on the overall iot system .",
    "hence , when there is an alarm message , the mtds transmitting the periodic messages must adjust their transmission parameters to satisfy the low delay and the high probability of successful transmission requirements of an alarm message .",
    "+ one simple solution is to reserve one of the @xmath12 codes only for the alarm messages all the time .",
    "however , since the alarm messages are a rare occurrence , this can be a waste of code resources in a resource - limited iot .",
    "moreover , as seen in and , reducing the number of codes from @xmath12 to @xmath36 will result in a significant reduction in system throughput .",
    "therefore , a novel framework to minimize the delay of an alarm message without significantly reducing the system throughput is necessary to improve the overall performance of an iot .",
    "the mtds must adjust their communication parameters , in terms of code selection , whenever there is an alarm message .",
    "for instance , by never using a reserved code , the system throughput in will be reduced .",
    "therefore , an ideal solution is to enable the mtds to adjust their communication parameters only once they become aware of the alarm message .",
    "therefore , there is a need for a learning framework using which mtds can learn of the presence of an alarm message and , subsequently , adapt their transmissions .",
    "such learning will allow the delay of an alarm message to be greatly reduced without jeopardizing network performance , such as system throughput in .",
    "+ any learning algorithm used by the mtds to learn the presence of an alarm message must satisfy certain properties to account for the unique nature of an iot . as one of the purposes of learning is to reduce the delay of an alarm message which is caused by an abnormality , such an algorithm must be decentralized , as the bs itself can have little to no information on the abnormality .",
    "moreover , learning must be properly tailored to the resource constrained nature of mtds .",
    "+ consequently , we propose a distributed learning algorithm using which the mtds can _ sequentially learn _ whether there is an alarm message based on their own information about the true , underlying state as well as that gathered from other mtds .",
    "sequential learning is a process in which agents sequentially estimate an underlying , binary state @xmath37 by observing their _ private signal _ and the estimates of previous agents without a central , omniscient entity @xcite . for our model ,",
    "@xmath38 means that there is an alarm message , and @xmath39 means that there is no alarm message .",
    "the private signal is a random variable , and its distribution depends on the true @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , the private signals are informative in estimating the true @xmath40 and are independently , identically distributed for different mtds . additionally , we assume that the likelihood ratio of any given private signal can not be 0 or infinity .",
    "in other words , for our model , a private signal can not fully reveal the true @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "therefore , private signals can be interpreted as independent binary signals with some probability of inferring the true @xmath40 . however , the agents do not know the probability of inferring the true @xmath40",
    ".      the unique properties of the iot pose challenges that are not dealt with in the conventional sequential learning literature such as @xcite . to sequentially learn whether there is an alarm message , the private signal for an mtd",
    "is defined as its observation of an abnormality . in the presence of an abnormality",
    ", we let @xmath41 be the probability of observing the abnormality and , then , @xmath42 would be the probability of not observing the abnormality .",
    "if there is no abnormality , the probability of observing an abnormality will be @xmath43 , and the probability of not observing an abnormality will be @xmath44 . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath45 and thus , @xmath46 .",
    "+ although the private signals are assumed to be equally informative in conventional sequential learning @xcite , the private signals for the mtds are not necessarily equally informative or may not even be informative in some cases .",
    "this is because an abnormality can be observed with probability @xmath41 only within certain distance @xmath47 from the abnormality .",
    "therefore , the mtds located beyond a distance @xmath47 from the abnormality will observe the abnormality with probability @xmath43 , and the private signals for the distant mtds are not informative about @xmath40 .",
    "+ in our model , the learning process of the mtds is initiated by one of their _ neighbors_. the neighbors of an mtd are defined to be the mtds that are within its communication range @xmath48 . after an mtd has learned @xmath40 , it will initiate the learning process on its neighbors .",
    "+ conventional sequential learning algorithms are typically developed for one dimensional settings , such as a line of agents @xcite .",
    "however , the mtds in an iot are deployed in a two - dimensional network .",
    "this brings in new , unique challenges .",
    "for instance , one such challenge is the fact that it is possible that multiple learning sequences may simultaneously arrive at an mtd .",
    "we assume that the mtds can not determine which learning sequence is the best and thus , an mtd will randomly choose one of the learning sequences to follow .",
    "moreover , it is possible for another learning sequence to arrive at an mtd that already belongs to some other learning sequence . in this case",
    ", we assume that an mtd will belong to the first learning sequence that it received .",
    "+ the necessary set of information for learning differs for the different types of sequential learning , and the set of information may include the estimates of @xmath40 of previous agents and the current state of learning process @xcite .",
    "the two main types of sequential learning schemes are _ infinite memory _ and _ finite memory_. the infinite memory sequential learning requires a complete knowledge of previous agents and their estimates of @xmath40 , and the necessary set of information will grow infinitely as the learning progresses .",
    "the finite memory sequential learning only requires information about a finite set of previous agents and thus , the necessary set of information is finite and fixed .",
    "most of works @xcite are on infinite memory sequential learning , but the infinite memory sequential learning is not suitable for the resource limited mtds due to computational limitations , power constraints , and communication restrictions .",
    "therefore , we focus on developing a finite memory sequential learning for the mtds in an iot .",
    "we propose a finite memory sequential learning algorithm , which extends the framework of @xcite to the iot case , thus enabling the mtds to properly learn whether or not there is an alarm message .",
    "our finite memory learning algorithm will nullify the effects of the limited observation range of an abnormality by using @xmath49 bits of information to learn @xmath40 and thus , the distant mtds with uninformative private signals can learn to adjust their communication parameters .",
    "@xmath50 is a design parameter affecting the convergence of learning , and the case of @xmath51 will coincide with the finite memory learning algorithm introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will focus on analyzing the performance of the proposed learning algorithm in the presence of an abnormality . + in our algorithm , we use @xmath49 bits of information to capture @xmath52 bits for tracking the learning process and @xmath53 bits for the private signals of previous mtds .",
    "the @xmath49 bits of information for an mtd @xmath26 are @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the private signal of mtd @xmath56 , @xmath57 is current estimate of the true @xmath40 , and @xmath58 indicates whether @xmath57 should be changed . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the @xmath52 bits for tracking the learning process . after learning , @xmath49 bits of information that an mtd @xmath26 will transmit to its neighbors will be @xmath59 , in which the oldest private signal @xmath60 is replaced by the private signal @xmath61 of an mtd @xmath26 .",
    "+ using previous private signals and its own private signal @xmath62 , an mtd will determine its _ private belief _ by maximum likelihood estimation of @xmath40 .",
    "the private belief is an estimate of the true @xmath40 only based on the private signals @xmath62 . in our proposed finite memory learning algorithm",
    ", the private belief will be used in place of the private signal in @xcite .",
    "the private belief @xmath63 for mtd @xmath26 is : @xmath64 since the private signals are independent .",
    "if the mtds know the values of @xmath41 and @xmath43 , @xmath63 can easily be found using : @xmath65 which is based on likelihood ratio test .",

    "@xmath68 which is higher than the probability @xmath41 that a private signal is reflecting the true @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that the private belief is more informative on the true @xmath40 than the private signal .",
    "+ for the mtds outside of the observation range , some of their @xmath53 previous private signals may stem from the mtds within the observation range . for an mtd @xmath26 outside of the observation range , we define @xmath69 to be the number of previous private signals that are from mtds within the observation range and @xmath70 to be the number of private signals that are from the mtds outside of the observation range .",
    "the probability that @xmath63 is reflecting the true @xmath40 for an mtd @xmath26 outside of the observation range will be : @xmath71 under the same assumption about the values of @xmath41 and @xmath43 , will simplify to @xmath72    the effective observation range @xmath73 of an abnormality with @xmath49-bit finite memory learning is @xmath74    from , @xmath69 must be at least 1 for having @xmath75 which implies that an mtd @xmath26 will have an informative private belief .",
    "since the oldest private signal @xmath60 is replaced by the current private signal @xmath76 , @xmath69 of an mtd @xmath26 outside of the observation range @xmath47 will decrement by 1 each time the sequential learning progresses .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 will eventually be zero for some mtds and thus , @xmath77 for such mtds .",
    "this implies that the private belief @xmath63 for such mtds will not be informative and thus , those mtds will not learn the true @xmath40 .",
    "+ since there are @xmath53 bits of previous private signals , @xmath69 will be zero after the sequential learning has progressed @xmath53 times .",
    "therefore , the furthest mtd with informative private belief is located @xmath78 from the observation range @xmath47 .",
    "the effective observation range @xmath73 in within which all of the mtds can learn the true @xmath40 depends on @xmath49 , which implies that @xmath49 is a design parameter that determines the number of mtds that will learn the true @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath79 , @xmath73 is greater than @xmath47 and thus , @xmath49-bit finite memory learning can effectively mitigate the limited observation range , which greatly limits the number of mtds that can learn the presence of an alarm message .",
    "although more mtds will learn with higher values of @xmath49 , it is not ideal to choose @xmath49 to be arbitrarily high , because an arbitrarily high value of @xmath49 will have undesirable effects , such as system throughput reduction .",

    "<S> machine - type devices ( mtds ) will lie at the heart of the internet of things ( iot ) system . a key challenge in such a system is sharing network resources between small mtds , which have limited memory and computational capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , a novel learning _ with finite memory </S>",
    "<S> _ framework is proposed to enable mtds to effectively learn about each others message state , so as to properly adapt their transmission parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an iot system in which mtds can transmit both delay tolerant , periodic messages and critical alarm messages is studied . </S>",
    "<S> for this model , the characterization of the exponentially growing delay for critical alarm messages and the convergence of the proposed learning framework in an iot are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show that the delay of critical alarm messages is significantly reduced up to @xmath0 with very minimal memory requirements . </S>",
    "<S> the results also show that the proposed learning with finite memory framework is very effective in mitigating the limiting factors of learning that prevent proper learning procedures . </S>"
