    "it is well - known that entangled atomic states ( e.g. so - called spin squeezed states ) potentially allow to significantly improve resolution in ramsey spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "entangled states are also a fundamental resource in quantum information and quantum computation science @xcite . however , in practice entangled states are difficult to prepare and maintain as noise and decoherence rapidly collapses them into classical statistical mixtures .",
    "thus one of the most important challenges in modern quantum physics is the design of robust and most - importantly decoherence resistant methods for entanglement generation .",
    "we have recently proposed a method @xcite that allows for noise resistent generation of entangled states .",
    "the method uses the energy gap of properly designed gapped - multi - degenerate hamiltonians . while the large number of degrees of freedom in the ground state manifold of such systems allows to create various quantum superpositions and to exploit rich dynamical evolution ( suitable for example for precision spectroscopy ) , the energy gap prevents decoherence as local excitations become energetically suppressed . a simple example of a many - body spin hamiltonian that illustrates the idea of our scheme is a multi - spin system with isotropic ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "these interactions will naturally align the spins . while all of the spins can be rotated together around an arbitrary axis without cost of energy , local spin flips are energetically forbidden .",
    "this paper presents a detailed analysis of this method when applied to trapped ions and cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "we demonstrate its applicability for decoherence resistant generation of @xmath0-particle greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite and the potential of the latter to be used for heisenberg - limited spectroscopy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec ii we review one of the standard procedures used to generate multi - particle ghz entangled states in ion traps and demonstrate the detrimental effect of phase decoherence in such entanglement generation schemes . in sec iii we explain the idea of a many - body protected manifold ( mpm ) and discuss how and under what conditions it can significatively reduce the effect of decoherence . in sec .",
    "iv we show the applicability of the gap protected evolution to precision measurements and discuss the significant improvement in phase sensitivity that it might provide . in section v we elaborate on the physical resources required for the implementation of the gap protected hamiltonian in trapped ions and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of its implementation with respect to standard unprotected hamiltonians . in sec .",
    "vi we study how to engineer the long range interactions required for the gap protected evolution in optical lattice systems interacting via short range interactions and discuss the effectiveness of the mpm for ghz generation . in sec .",
    "vii we analyze in such systems the effect of non - ideal conditions such as the magnetic trapping confinement and finally conclude in sec.viii .",
    "in this section we start by reviewing a method to generate multi - particle entangled states in a system of @xmath0 spin 1/2 atoms by time evolution under the so called squeezing hamiltonian . @xmath1 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath2 hamiltonian can be implemented in trapped ions by using the collective vibrational motion of the ions in a linear trap driven by illuminating them with a laser field @xcite . in eq.([hz ] ) we used @xmath3 to denote the collective spin operators of the @xmath0 atoms : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a pauli operator acting on the @xmath7 atom and we have identified the two relevant internal states of the atoms with the effective spin index @xmath8 . in this manuscript",
    "we will use units such that @xmath9 and assume @xmath0 to be even .    an appropriate basis to describe the dynamics of the system is the one spanned by collective pseudo - spin states denoted as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is an additional quantum number associated with the permutation group which is required to form a complete set of labels for all the @xmath15 possible states .",
    "the entanglement generation process starts by preparing the system at @xmath16 in a fully polarized state along the @xmath17 direction , @xmath18 . as any state with @xmath19",
    "is uniquely characterized by @xmath20 , for denoting them we omit the additional @xmath21 label .",
    "fully polarized states along @xmath17 can be written as a superposition of states with different @xmath20 values along the @xmath22 direction : @xmath23 . during the evolution the hamiltonian imprints an @xmath24 dependent phase to the different components .",
    "as the system evolves , at first the winding of the phases leads to a collapse of @xmath25 .",
    "however , at time @xmath26 all components rephase with opposite polarization , and a perfect revival of the initial state is observed with @xmath27 ( see fig.[figu1 ] ) .",
    "specifically , the time evolution of @xmath28 for systems with @xmath29 can be shown to be given by :    @xmath30    right at time @xmath31 the system becomes a macroscopic superposition of fully polarized states along the @xmath32 direction , i.e. a @xmath0-particle ghz state of the form @xmath33 with and @xmath34 real phases given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have used this type of scheme to generate ghz states in trapped ions with the aim to perform precision measurements of @xmath37 , the energy splitting between @xmath38 and @xmath39 levels . ideally the use of ghz states should enhance the phase sensitivity to the fundamental heisenberg limit @xcite . however , decoherence significantly limited the applicability of the method .      to understand the detrimental effect of decoherence we first assume that the dominant type of decoherence is single - particle dephasing .",
    "such dephasing comes from processes that , while preserving the populations in the atomic levels , randomly change the phases leading to a decay of the off - diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "we model the phase decoherence by adding to eq .",
    "( 1 ) the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 are assumed to be independent stochastic gaussian processes with zero mean and with autocorrelation function @xmath42 .",
    "here the bar denotes averaging over the different random outcomes . in what follows we will use the property that zero mean gaussian variables satisfy @xmath43}=\\exp [ -\\gamma(t)]$ ] , with @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "phase decoherence causes an exponential decay of the revival peak and and @xmath0 dependent decay of the fidelity , defined as latexmath:[$\\mathcal{f}(t_0)=\\overline{\\langle \\psi ^{ghz}_x    qualitatively the effect of phase decoherence on the evolving state can be understood from the energy levels of @xmath2 ( see fig . [ figu2 ] ) .",
    "while @xmath2 commutes with both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 only commutes with @xmath49 does not commute with @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , in the presence of phase decoherence transitions between different @xmath51 subspaces are allowed as long as @xmath20 is conserved .",
    "as all the states with the same @xmath52 value are degenerate , there is no energy barrier to prevent such transitions and very quickly the initially populated @xmath19 manifold is depleted and the fidelity of generating the ghz state significantly degraded .",
    "moreover , the degradation scales exponential with increasing @xmath0 due to the exponential scalability of the number of accessible states to which the initially @xmath19 population can be transferred to .",
    "quantitatively the effect of decoherence can be calculated by using the uncoupled spin basis as it diagonalizes the total hamiltonian .",
    "each state in this basis can be label as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    if at @xmath16 the reduced density matrix of the system , @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 , after time @xmath59 @xmath60}\\times\\notag\\\\ & & e^{-i\\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_0^t d\\tau h_i(\\tau ) ( s _ { i}^{k}- s_{i}^{l } ) } \\label{dede }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence , @xmath61=e^{-\\gamma(t)}\\langle { \\hat{j}^{(0)}}_{x}(t)\\rangle|_{\\gamma = 0}$ ] with @xmath62 the expectation value in the absence of noise ( eq.([jz2 ] ) ) .",
    "the factor @xmath63 comes from the fact that the operator @xmath64 only probes one - particle coherence , i.e it only connects states with exactly one spin flipped .    assuming that at @xmath16 all atoms are polarized in the @xmath17 direction ,",
    "i.e. @xmath65 , one can show from eq .",
    "( [ dede ] ) that the fidelity is degraded to    @xmath66",
    "let us now consider what happens if in addition of @xmath67 we assume that there is an isotropic infinite range ferromagnetic interactions between the spins so the system hamiltonian is described by the hamiltonian @xmath68 , where @xmath69 here we have assumed that all atoms are in different orbitals but have enough of spatial overlap that every spin interacts with every other spin .",
    "the isotropic hamiltonian @xmath70 has a ground state manifold spanned by a set of @xmath71 degenerate states .",
    "they lie on the surface of the bloch sphere with maximal radius @xmath19 and are totally symmetric , i.e. invariant with respect to particle permutations .",
    "there is a finite energy gap @xmath72 that isolates the ground state manifold from the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "this gap is the key for the many - body protection against decoherence .",
    "hereunder we will refer to the ground state manifold as the _ many - body protected manifold _ ( mpm ) .      the low energy spectrum of @xmath73 is shown in fig . [ figu2b ] .",
    "as @xmath74 commutes with @xmath70 , in the absence of decoherence the latter does not affect at all the ghz generation dynamics , however in the presence of decoherence the latter does significatively reduces the effect of local environmental noise .",
    "the protection can be best understood by using the basis of collective states . in terms of collective spin operators",
    "@xmath48 can be written as :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "note that allowed transitions must conserve @xmath20 as both the system and noise hamiltonian commute with @xmath78 . in the presence of a large energy gap @xmath79",
    ", one can distinguish two different type of processes : ( i ) decoherence effects that take place within the mpm due to the collective dynamics induced by the @xmath80 component of @xmath48 , and ( ii ) transitions across the gap induced by the inhomogeneous terms .",
    "the later couple the mpm with the rest of the system , however they are nonenergy conserving process and consequently perturbatively weak .    using a perturbative analysis , and assuming that at @xmath16 the system lies within the mpm , the evolution of the projection of the density matrix on the mpm : @xmath81 can be written as @xmath82here    @xmath83    accounts for the dynamics induced by the noise within the mpm and @xmath84 takes into account the depletion of the @xmath19 levels due to transition matrix elements between @xmath85 and states outside the mpm : @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 are the respective energy splittings . because @xmath48 is a vector operator , according to the wigner - eckart theorem , @xmath48 only couples the states in the mpm with states which have @xmath88 and thus with excitation energy @xmath89 .    assuming the power spectrum of the noise , @xmath90 , to have a cut - off frequency @xmath91 ( e.g. @xmath92 for @xmath93 and 0 otherwise ) , we find that @xmath94 in the limit when the noise is sufficiently slow , i.e. @xmath95 , then @xmath96 is bounded for all times , @xmath97 and the atomic population within the ground state manifold is fully preserved i.e. @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ densp ] ) .",
    "consequently , in the slow noise limit type ( ii ) processes are energetically forbidden and only type ( i ) processes are effective and therefore the noise acts just as a uniform random magnetic field : if at @xmath16 @xmath99 , then after time @xmath59 each component @xmath100 acquires an additional random phase @xmath101 and on average @xmath102 the factor of @xmath103 in the denominator of @xmath104 is fundamental for the reduction of the effect of decoherence within the mpm . for example , it makes @xmath105 to decay @xmath0 times slower than in the unprotected system : i.e. @xmath106 .    assuming all atoms are initially polarized in the @xmath17 direction , @xmath107 , using eqs .",

    "we now discuss the protection against spin flips , which can be modeled by terms proportional to @xmath113 , @xmath114 in the noise hamiltonian , eq.([env ] ) .",
    "first of all note that as the @xmath38 and @xmath39 states have a finite energy splitting @xmath37 , low frequency noise associated with such terms will be suppressed due it .",
    "however , most of the spin flips are generally induced by imperfections in the laser fields and therefore are at frequencies close to @xmath37 , i.e. they correspond to low frequency noise in the rotating frame of the laser . in the case involving ghz state generation ,",
    "the finite energy cost imposed by @xmath115 between levels with different @xmath52 value tends to inhibit these processes as illustrated in fig .",
    "if in addition @xmath116 is present this natural protection can be enhanced due to the fact that the energy gap suppresses the component of the noise that cause transitions between the mpm and other manifolds .",
    "more precisely , noise modeled as @xmath117 , when projected into the mpm reduces to @xmath118 with @xmath119 .    in fig .",
    "[ figur3 ] we quantify the protection provided by the mpm . in the absence of any protection we find the finite energy cost imposed by @xmath120 helps to protect the system against transversal noise . instead of the exponential decay ( @xmath121 ) of the fidelity observed when dephasing is present spin flips degrades the fidelity as @xmath122 ( at least for the moderated @xmath123 we have to restrict our simulations ) .",
    "with protection the fidelity scales even better as the transversal noise is restricted to act only within the mpm . instead of the exponential decay of the ghz generation fidelity with @xmath0 , with protection it decays as @xmath124 with @xmath125 a numerical constant , @xmath126 ( for this result we do not have to restrict to moderated n ) .",
    "hence , with @xmath70 we gain a factor of order @xmath127 .",
    "the reason why @xmath128 and @xmath129 noise degrade stronger the fidelity than @xmath130 noise ( which leads just to a @xmath0 independent fidelity ) is that the former do not commute with @xmath2 and mix states with different @xmath20 quantum number .",
    "additionally in the figure we show that for noise with long correlation time the use of spin echo techniques can help to further reduce the effect of decoherence .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have generated ghz states made of up to six beryllium ions and used them to perform precision measurements of @xmath37 .",
    "for the ideal ghz state preparation , the spectroscopy should lead to heisenberg - limited resolution , @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , even for six ions , the phase accuracy was significantly degraded by decoherence .",
    "the spectroscopy @xcite was realized by first creating the desire ghz state by applying to the initial polarized state , @xmath132 the unitary gate operation @xmath133 .",

    "the phase difference was then decoded by measuring the collapse probability into the states @xmath132 or @xmath136 after applying the unitary transformation @xmath137 .",

    "if the time required to generate the ghz state is such that @xmath154 ( i.e when @xmath155 $ ] ) , the phase accuracy is reduced to the classical shot noise resolution .    however ,",
    "if instead @xmath156 is used for the ghz generation , @xmath157 is replaced by @xmath158 . due to the @xmath0 times",
    "slower decay rate of the atomic coherences , the same preparation time that leads to shot noise resolution without protection , can lead to a sensitivity at the level of the fundamental heisenberg limit with protection .",

    "the dominant processes are two - photon transitions leading to a simultaneous excitation of pairs of ions .",
    "we first assume that the ion trap is in the lamb - dicke limit , i.e. , that the ions are cooled sufficiently enough , such that for all relevant excitation numbers @xmath150 of the trap oscillation @xmath170 holds . in this limit",

    "the second term acts as an effective magnetic field which can be canceled by adding an external magnetic field or by echo techniques .",

    "we write the manybody wave function as @xmath289 , where @xmath290 span the hilbert space with one atom per site and @xmath291 span the subspace with one particle and one hole adjacent to each other and @xmath292 singly occupied sites .",

    "it would be difficult to create a unit filled mott insulator as in an homogeneous system it only takes place when the number of atoms is exactly equal to the number of lattice sites .",
    "a drawback of the magnetic confinement is that it generates always superfluid regions at the edge of the cloud , so only a fraction of the total trapped atoms located at the trap center has to be selected as the quantum register .",

    "we have in this paper evaluated the possibility for a robust preparation of multi - particle ghz entangled states of trapped ions or cold atoms in optical lattice by generating a decoherence free multi - level manifold corresponding to the ground levels of properly designed hamiltonians .",
    "the mpm is isolated from the rest of the hilbert space by an energy gap which energetically suppresses any local decoherence processes .",
    "we have presented analytical estimates for the fidelity of the ghz preparation .    in trapped ions we demonstrated that the fidelity can be significantly better than the one achievable without any gap protection and therefore that our scheme is in the position to improve the spectroscopy resolution in current ramsey spectroscopy experiments .",
    "we also showed that cold atoms in optical lattices interacting via short range interactions can be utilized to engineer long range interactions which in turn can be used for generating many - body entanglement .",
    "we calculated the effects of non - ideal conditions and concluded that the main restriction in these systems is the scalability as the mpm protection degrades with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the scalability certainly limits the use of lattice systems for massive entanglement generation , however it is not a problem for recent quasi - one dimensional experiments @xcite where an array of 1d tubes with an average of 18 atoms per tube has been realized . in such systems",
    "therefore it should be possible to create few - particle collective entangled states using our scheme and to perform proof - of - principle experiments demonstrating the improvement of spectroscopic sensitivity .",
    "we emphasize that , even though we have limited the discussion to ensembles of spin @xmath315 particles , the mpm ideas can be straightforwardly generalized to systems composed of higher spin atoms . besides entanglement generation , the mpm might have also important applications for the implementation of good storage memories using for example nuclear spin ensembles in solid state @xcite or photons@xcite .",
