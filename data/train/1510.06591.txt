    "geospace monitoring of seismogenic disturbances using non - seismic sensors has gain significant momentum in the last decade . during giant tsunamis that occurred in last ten years , tsunamigenic disturbances in the atmospheric airglow from all - sky imagers , ionospheric electron density from gnss receivers and geomagnetic disturbances from magnetometers",
    "were reported @xcite .",
    "for the first time , airglow disturbances over hawaii were observed during tohoku - oki tsunami @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect observed during this tsunami was the presence of tsunamigenic total electron content ( tec ) disturbances towards continent opposite to the tsunami propagation direction , covering up to 25@xmath0 from epicentral distance @xcite .",
    "these backward propagating disturbances were simulated and interpreted as owing to the strong atmosphere shaking from the tsunami forcing near the coast @xcite .",
    "motivated by the presence of backward propagating tsunamigenic disturbances during tohoku - oki tsunami , we search for such disturbances in the present study during the chile tsunami that occurred on 16th of september , 2015 at 22:55 ut , with epicenter located at @xmath1 s and @xmath2 w in @xmath3 km depth , and accompanied by an earthquake of magnitude @xmath4 .",
    "we select a brazilian observatory located at so jos dos campos ( sjc - 23.2@xmath0s , 45.9@xmath0w ) and present the observation from the all - sky imager and magnetometer .",
    "the all - sky is a 180@xmath0 field of view multispectral imaging system that uses four 4-inch diameter interference filter of 2.0 nm bandwidth for oi 557.7 nm emission .",
    "the oi 557.7-nm greenline emission has been largely used to investigate wave dynamical processes around the mesopause region . in this kind of images , it is possible to observe gravity waves and tides signatures as well as infer the atomic oxygen profile @xcite .",
    "the oi 557.7-nm emission volumetric peak rate occurs around 95@xmath52 km . a fluxgate magnetometer with 0.1 nt resolution belonging to `` universidade do vale do paraba '' is used in the present study .",
    "this magnetometer also belongs to embrace magnetometer network in south america . in figure",
    "[ fig : map ] , the epicenter of earthquake and sjc observatory location are shown .",
    "also , it is shown an airglow image over sjc with effective field of view .",

    "the red square shows the epicenter of the chilean earthquake of 16th september , 2015 .",
    "the circle indicates the field of view at a zenith angle of 90@xmath0 projected at a @xmath6 km altitude and presents a raw image for oi 557.7-nm emission obtained at 23:05 lt over the field of view .",
    "the black dot shows sjc location.,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] + [ fig : ttt ]",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      +   +    in figures  [ fig:557][fig : direction ] , we present the images on the night of september 1617 , 2015 obtained using all - sky imager .",
    "figure  [ fig:557 ] shows sequences of images of the oi 557.7-nm emission in which we note the presence of faint band - like airglow disturbances that appear around 02:05 ut ( 3 hours and 5 minutes after the earthquake event ) and last about 30 minutes .",
    "these disturbances have wavefront aligned in northwest - southeast and propagated in northeastward direction , _",
    "i. e. _ , in the opposite direction to the tsunami propagation . from an enlarged image at 02:05 ut in figure",
    "[ fig : direction ] , we note that these disturbances have wavelength in between 60 to 100 km . the airglow movie for the night of this reported event and the night before and after are available in the auxiliary material as movie_15sep2015 , movie_16sep2015 and movie_17sep2015 for comparison . from these movies",
    ", we verify that such disturbances as noted on the night of tsunami are absent on other days .",
    "band - like airglow disturbances are common feature over brazilian region , and they are associated to gravity waves / medium - scale traveling ionospheric disturbances ( gws / mstids ) @xcite .",
    "both mesospheric gws and mstids signatures observed in airglow images by @xcite are commonly attributed to tropospheric convective processes or to middle latitude instabilities .",
    "in addition , they have opposite orientation ( northeast to southwest ) and propagation direction ( northwestward ) to those observed here .",
    "therefore , the observed airglow disturbances in figures  [ fig:557][fig : direction ] are not the convectively - driven gws / mstids commonly observed in the region .    on the other hand ,",
    "these disturbances are possibly seismogenic or tsunamigenic . for the tohoku - oki tsunami ,",
    "ionospheric disturbances in tec were reported to propagate towards backward direction in the form of concentric wavefronts , and to arrive up to 23@xmath0 from epicentral distance @xcite .",
    "the airglow disturbances in figures  [ fig:557][fig : direction ] offer a similar scenario where their presences are noted at 20003000 km ( @xmath718@xmath0  27@xmath0 ) from epicentral distance in the backward direction .    for the tohoku - oki tsunami , the backward propagating tec disturbances were simulated and interpreted as owing to the strong atmosphere shaking from the tsunami forcing near the coast @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed backward propagating airglow disturbances in the present study are possibly arising from the similar atmospheric shaking .      on figures  [ fig : event][fig : comphez ] ,",
    "geomagnetic field measurements are presented . in figure",
    "[ fig : event ] , the h- and z - components during 16 - 17 september , 2015 are plotted . in figure",
    "[ fig : comphez ] , the mean value ( black color ) of the quietest day of september ( 2015 ) and the standard deviation ( grey color ) between each day to the mean value are plotted .",
    "the 16th of september , 2015 is highlighted in blue color .     +    in figure  [ fig : event ] , we note a magnetic pulse around 24:00 ut , about 40 minutes after the earthquake .",
    "such pulse is not present on previous night .",
    "also , we note the presence of such pulse in figure  [ fig : comphez ] on night of tsunami while no such pulse is present in any other quiet days of september , 2015 .",
    "moreover , this pulse appears during the time when the seismic tremors were felt in the region .",
    "consequently , these aspects provide further evidence that this magnetic pulse is seismogenic or tsunamigenic .     +",
    "we document first report on the airglow and geomagnetic field disturbances related to the recently occurred chile tsunami ( 2015 ) . also , these disturbances are observed over the brazilian sector for the first time .",
    "the fact of airglow disturbances could be detected in opposite direction of the tsunami propagating is very encouraging , and it shows that the constant monitoring of the ionosphere and geomagnetic field could play an important role to calibrate seismic / tsunami models , and used in understanding of the physical processes involved in the tsunami propagation .",
    "v. klausner and c. m. n. candido wish to thanks their postdoctoral research for the financial support within the programa nacional de ps - doutorado ( pnpd  capes ) at univap and inpe , respectively .",
