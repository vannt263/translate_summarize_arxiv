    "in year 2012 , @xcite discovered a small cloud , later named `` g2 '' , at few thousands schwarzschild radii from sgra*. g2 has both a dust component , visible in the near infrared @xmath3 band , and a gaseous component , visible in br@xmath4 and other recombination lines .",
    "the cloud lies on a very eccentric orbit ( @xmath5 ) and reached its pericenter in early 2014 , with a distance from sgra * of @xmath6 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the line emission shows an increasing spatial extent and a broadening in the velocity space , interpreted as tidal stretching of the cloud by the tidal field of sgra * @xcite . observed position - velocity ( pv )",
    "diagrams and br@xmath4 maps also show the presence of a tail ( g2 t ) , following g2 on roughly the same orbit @xcite .",
    "we performed 3d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic simulations with the code pluto to understand whether g2 s gas component can be the outflow of a central source .",
    "we start the source at apocenter and let it move on the best - fit orbit derived by @xcite .",
    "we include an idealized adaf - like atmosphere and the gravitational field of sgra * ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the outflow initially expands with a spherical shape and stalls due to pressure balance .",
    "close to pericenter , the ram pressure of the atmosphere and the tidal force of the smbh increase .",
    "this leads to the stripping of the rayleigh - taylor fingers of shocked outflow material and to the stretching of the cloud ( see fig .",
    "we compare to observations by constructing mock position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams .",
    "for relatively high mass - loss rates ( @xmath0 ) and low velocity ( @xmath9 ) , the shocked outflow material can reasonably reproduce g2 in the observed pv diagrams , as in the case of the _ diffuse cloud scenario _",
    "( see conference contribution by marc schartmann ) . for same mass - loss rate , but higher velocity ( @xmath10 ) , the external ram pressure is more effective and the stripped material accumulates in the trailing region , forming a long tail ( see fig .",
    "the simulated pv diagrams , in the latter case , result in a bimodal emission ( see fig . 1c and * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion ) . in the latter scenario , g2",
    "would be produced by the leading stagnation shock of the outflow and g2 t by the long tail of stripped material .",
    "as in the case of previous studies @xcite , our best matching parameters seem to suggest a massive outflow , typical of young stellar objects such as t tauri stars ( as already suggested by * ? ?",
    "* see also the conference contribution by michal zajaek ) .",
    "a t tauri star is also appealing , since it could naturally explain the presence of dust embedded in g2 .",
    "the nature of g2 remains an open question ; however , in the case of a compact source , we should be able to observe a decoupling between the source and the previous outflow ( i.e. , between the dust and gas components ) in the next 5 - 10 years ( see fig .",
    "a new g2 should reform around the source , later on ."
