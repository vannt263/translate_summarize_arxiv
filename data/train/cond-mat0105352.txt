    "20 years after the investigation of transport in stratified random media by matheron and de marsily @xcite , their model is still intriguing . not only because it is exactly solvable , but also as it serves as a prototype of models exhibiting super - diffusive behaviour @xcite . as such it found applications in various fields like hydromechanics @xcite , @xcite and polymer physics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ the original model can be described as follows : consider a two - dimensional random medium consisting of distinct parallel layers ( or strata ) which extend in @xmath0-direction and have varying permeability .",
    "the resulting velocity field @xmath1 for a fluid flow in this medium depends only on the component @xmath2 transverse to the layers . in a random ensemble of such stratified media",
    ", it is a random field with given statistical properties .",
    "+ the properties of such two - dimensional stratified models are well known in the asymptotic limit of large times , @xmath3 , and for the case of vanishing local diffusion , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the large scale transport behaviour is roughly characterised by the mean square displacement of the tracer particles , appropriately averaged over the ensemble of the random flow fields .",
    "the time derivative of this quantity encodes the large scale diffusion or , as it is called , ` dispersion ' coefficient @xmath4 of the tracer cloud as a function of time",
    ". the transport is called diffusive if this coefficient becomes a finite constant in the asymptotic long - time limit @xmath5 , it is called super - diffusive if it asymptotically grows with time as @xmath6 with @xmath7 . for a flow field parallel to the strata the model exhibits ( for @xmath8 ) such a super - diffusive behaviour with @xmath9 . in the more general case , where one also has a transversal flow component , the dispersion coefficient eventually tends to a constant value , i.e. the transport shows normal diffusive behaviour .",
    "+ however , what is still lacking , to the best of our knowledge , is a detailed analysis of the pre - asymptotic behaviour of the model and , even more interestingly , of the corresponding sample to sample fluctuations of the dispersion coefficient .",
    "the latter is crucial for the reliability of the model .",
    "small fluctuations indicate that the transport parameters which are constructed as averages over the random ensemble are indeed also representative for the behaviour of individual realizations of the ensemble .",
    "+ in the present article , we try to close this gap . assuming a stratified gaussian random flow with a gaussian correlation function , we derive exact expressions for the dispersion coefficient and its mean square fluctuations as a function of time .",
    "the latter quantity encodes the sample to sample fluctuations of the dispersion coefficient .",
    "we show that it remains finite even in the asymptotic limit of infinite times @xmath3 as long as the initial tracer distribution is of finite extent which implies that in the given two - dimensional model the dispersion coefficient , surprisingly , is not self - averaging .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : in section [ model ] we give a brief description of the two - dimensional matheron - de marsily model and define the corresponding transport parameters .",
    "the next two sections deal with the exactly stratified model ( i.e. a model where the flow field is aligned parallel to the strata ) , and with the more general case of a non - vanishing transverse flow component . in section [ ave ]",
    "we analyse the self - averaging properties of the given transport parameters .",
    "the transport of a passive tracer particle by a two - dimensional flow field @xmath10 is modelled by a langevin equation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the position - vector of the particle , and @xmath13@xmath14 is a gaussian white noise which generates the local diffusion process .",
    "it has zero mean @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) , and a correlation function @xmath17 , where @xmath18 stands for the average over the white noise ensemble .",
    "we assume a diagonal local diffusion tensor , @xmath19 which , however , may have different entries for the longitudinal and the transversal diffusion constants , @xmath20 . + in a two - dimensional stratified medium",
    "the flow field @xmath1 depends on @xmath2 only . in the model investigated here",
    ", one has @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the components of a constant drift velocity in @xmath24-and @xmath25-direction , whereas @xmath26 is the random flow contribution generated by the layer to layer permeability variations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ the langevin equation therefore reduces to @xmath27 the flow contribution @xmath28 is a random function chosen from an appropriate stationary ensemble which defines its stochastic properties . in the model investigated here , we assume that it has zero mean and a gaussian correlation function , @xmath29 the over - bar denotes the average with respect to disorder ensemble , the parameter @xmath30 quantifies the disorder strength , and @xmath31 denotes the correlation length of the field . as is shown below , these two relations uniquely determine the temporal behaviour of the dispersion coefficient , higher correlation functions do not enter .",
    "this , however , is no longer true if one deals with the sample to sample fluctuations of this dispersion coefficient . in this case one",
    "needs also an explicit expression for the four - point function of the random field . for simplicity , and without severe restriction of generality ,",
    "let us assume a gaussian ensemble , so all higher correlation functions can be decomposed into products of the given two - point function .",
    "+ equation ( [ lang1 ] ) and ( [ lang2 ] ) define a system of differential equations which is readily solved by @xmath32 the single tracer particle subject to a given noise history is characterized by its trajectory @xmath33 , where the subscript @xmath34 indicates the fact that the tracer coordinates at a given time @xmath35 still depend on the initial injection position @xmath36 .",
    "+ in the general case where one has a spatially extended injection of material at time @xmath37 the injection points @xmath34 are distributed according to a distribution @xmath38 which without restriction is chosen to be normalised , @xmath39 the shape of the resulting concentration distribution is characterised by its moments @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 ) which in particular are used to define the centre - of - mass velocity and the dispersion coefficients of the resulting concentration plume .",
    "the centre - of - mass velocity ( for a given realization of the flow field ) reads @xmath42 the dispersion coefficients which give the spreading rate of the plume are defined by @xmath43 in a stochastic approach , the given single medium is viewed as one particular realization of a spatial stochastic process .",
    "large scale transport coefficients are derived from appropriately constructed averages over the ensemble of all possible medium realizations .",
    "these averages represent statistical properties of the ( artificial ) ensemble as a whole . at first glance",
    ", they therefore seem to be of limited predictive value with respect to the properties of a single given aquifer . for appropriately chosen quantities ,",
    "however , in many cases the fluctuations from realization to realization become small as soon as the cloud has sampled a sufficiently large representative part of the given medium .",
    "as soon as the transport properties found in different realizations of the medium then fluctuate only weakly around the corresponding ensemble averages , these averages again also predict properties characteristic of a single typical realization of the medium .",
    "+ in what follows , we investigate such ensemble averages of the centre - of - mass velocity and the dispersion coefficients .",
    "we call the averaged quantities corresponding to ( [ cmveloc ] ) and ( [ dispcoeff ] ) `` effective '' quantities .",
    "the resulting effective centre - of - mass velocity and effective dispersion coefficient are defined as @xmath44 and @xmath45 the non - diagonal dispersion coefficients vanish due to symmetry reasons .",
    "note that two types of averages are involved , the average over the white noise which generates the local diffusion process , indicated by the brackets , and the average over the disorder ensemble , indicated by the over - bar .",
    "the order in which these averages are performed is crucial , as the following slightly different definition of an averaged dispersion coefficient demonstrates .",
    "we define what we call `` ensemble dispersion coefficients '' as @xmath46 this quantity , which also is well known and frequently used in the literature , represents the dispersion characteristics of the whole ensemble of realizations of the flow field .",
    "it takes into account an artificial dispersion effect caused by fluctuations of the centre - of - mass positions of the tracer distributions in different realizations of the inhomogeneous medium .",
    "this effect is suppressed in the effective dispersion coefficient as defined in ( [ deff_pt ] ) because there the centre - of - mass positions are superimposed before the ensemble average is performed . for an extensive discussion of these problems and the related literature ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite . in general , the experimentally observable dispersion which is a property related to a single given realization is represented by the effective quantity @xmath47 .",
    "usually , at finite times the ensemble quantity overestimates the experimentally observable dispersion considerably , see again the detailed discussion given in @xcite , @xcite . in the asymptotic long - time limit @xmath3",
    ", however , one usually expects that the two types of dispersion coefficients become equal .",
    "+ for the model investigated here , the full temporal behaviour of the given transport coefficients can be evaluated explicitly .",
    "the corresponding calculations are elementary but somewhat tedious .",
    "they are summarized in [ app1 ] . using the explicit solution ( [ solution ] ) and performing the appropriate averages",
    ", one finds the more or less trivial results @xmath48 valid for all times .",
    "a more interesting behaviour follows for the longitudinal dispersion coefficients .",
    "here one derives the relations @xmath49 where we use @xmath50 as a convenient short - hand notation . + one can already observe three simple features : first of all , the effective and the ensemble dispersion coefficient in the direction transversal to the flow field are both equal to the local dispersion coefficient @xmath51 .",
    "the heterogenities of the model do not change this property because they do not depend on the fluctuating part of the flow field .",
    "the particles perform a simple random walk in @xmath2-direction .",
    "secondly , the effective dispersion coefficient in @xmath0-direction does not depend on the longitudinal extension of the initial distribution .",
    "this stems from the infinite correlation length of the flow field in that direction .",
    "the third observation is that the ensemble dispersion coefficient does not show any dependence on the size of the initial distribution . +",
    "what remains to be evaluated is the explicit behaviour of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient . in the following",
    "we will discuss the cases @xmath52 , where the fluid flow is aligned with the strata of the medium ( the so called ` exactly stratified model ' ) , and @xmath53 separately as they give rise to a different asymptotic behaviour .",
    "we will further distinguish between a point - like initial distribution at @xmath54 ( which implies @xmath55 in ( [ moments ] ) ) and an spatially extended distribution @xmath56 where the injection points are aligned along a line in @xmath2 direction . as it turns out , the line shape is no restriction of generality since a finite extent in @xmath0-direction does not alter the given results .",
    "for @xmath52 and a point - like initial distribution the expressions for the effective dispersion coefficients given by equations ( [ d11ens ] ) and ( [ d11eff ] ) can be evaluated easily .",
    "one derives @xmath57 where the time - scale @xmath58 is a measure for the diffusive transport over one transversal correlation length .",
    "the result is plotted in figure [ dkpkt ] .",
    "there are two characteristic regimes .",
    "for @xmath59 the dispersion coefficients asymptotically are given as @xmath60 in this regime there exist great fluctuations between the centre of mass coordinates of the source in different realizations of the flow field , the transport is dominated by advection which explains the linear time dependence of the ensemble dispersion coefficient . in each realization",
    "the particles only experience local diffusion which can be seen in the effective value which is approximately constant .",
    "this behaviour characterises the taylor regime as already described by @xcite .",
    "+ in the opposite long time limit , @xmath61 , the dispersion coefficients take the following asymptotic form @xmath62 \\ ,",
    "\\sqrt{2\\tau_d }   \\;\\ ; t^{1/2}\\ ;   \\;+ o\\left(\\left(t/\\tau_d\\right)^{-1/2}\\right ) \\label{3.31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they show the well known anomalous diffusion @xmath63-behaviour with different pre - factors for the two types of dispersion coefficients , a result which is already described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors derive this result by considering the asymptotic behaviour of a particle exhibiting a random walk and experiencing a different velocity after each time step , i.e. in each layer .",
    "the factor of @xmath64 between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is due to large fluctuations in the centre of mass coordinates of the source distribution in different realizations .",
    "+ for an extended initial distribution ( in particular for the line source given by equation ( [ initialdistrib ] ) the expression for the ensemble coefficient @xmath65 as given in ( [ dens_pt_v0 ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "the effective dispersion coefficient , however , now reads @xmath67 another time - scale that becomes relevant , @xmath68 , is the typical time for diffusive transport over the width @xmath69 of the initial concentration distribution . for times much smaller than @xmath70",
    "the effect of a finite initial extent of the injection region is equivalent to averaging over various realizations .",
    "the dispersion coefficient tends to the ensemble value given by given by equation ( [ dens_pt_v0 ] ) . for times much longer than @xmath70 the system behaviour no longer depends on the initial width of the injection region .",
    "the effective dispersion coefficient , therefore , tends to the value derived for a point source , equation ( [ deff_pt_v0 ] ) .",
    "the resulting temporal behaviour is plotted in figure [ dklin ] . for an infinite @xmath69 the value of @xmath71 tends to @xmath65 for all times .",
    "unlike the exactly stratified model , the long - time behaviour for the case @xmath53 shows normal diffusion for asymptotically large times , @xmath72 .",
    "evaluating equations ( [ d11ens ] ) and ( [ d11eff ] ) now lead to the more complicated expressions @xmath73   \\qquad   \\label{dens_pt_v } \\\\ & & d_{11}^{{\\rm eff}}(t )   = d^{{\\rm ens}}(t ) - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\ , \\sigma_0 ^ 2 \\ , \\tau_v \\left [ \\ ;      { \\rm erf}\\left ( \\sqrt{\\frac{t^2/2\\tau_v^2}{1 + 2t/\\tau_d } } \\ ; \\right )    \\ ; +   \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad + \\ ; \\left . \\exp\\left (   \\frac{\\tau_d^2}{2\\tau_v^2 } ( 1 + 4t/\\tau_d ) \\right ) \\left\\ {      { \\rm erf}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{t^2/2\\tau_v^2}{1 + 2t/\\tau_d } } \\ ; ( \\tau_d / t + 3 ) \\right ) \\ ; -   \\right.\\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad \\qquad   -   \\left.\\left .   { \\rm erf}\\left(\\sqrt { \\frac{\\tau_d^2}{2\\tau_v^2 } ( 1 + 4t/\\tau_d)}\\ ; \\right)\\ ; \\right\\ } \\ ; \\right ]   \\qquad   \\label{deff_pt_v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the gaussian error function as defined in @xcite .",
    "the time - scale @xmath75 is set by the time necessary to transport a tracer particle advectively over one correlation length of the flow field .",
    "+ for @xmath76 three regimes can be distinguished which is shown in figure [ dku2 ] . for small times",
    "the advection has only a negligible influence on the dispersion coefficient .",
    "we can therefore identify the two superdiffusive regimes from the exactly stratified case , i.e. the taylor - regime given by eqns .",
    "( [ 3.28 ] ) and ( [ 3.29 ] ) for @xmath77 ( neglecting terms of the order @xmath78 and @xmath79 , resp . ) and the superdiffusive @xmath63-behaviour given by eqns . ( [ 3.30 ] ) and ( [ 3.31 ] ) for @xmath80 ( neglecting terms of the order @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ) . in the asymptotic limit @xmath3 the system exhibits normal diffusion .",
    "the values of the dispersion coefficients are @xmath83 which shows that , somewhat unexpectedly , the two quantities do not become equal even in the normal - diffusive case .",
    "this model seems to be a counter - example to metzger s conjecture @xcite that for normally diffusive models the effective and the ensemble dispersion coefficients should always become equal in the asymptotic limit . +",
    "one remarkable feature of the cross - over between the superdiffusive and the normal diffusive regime is that it does not occur at @xmath84 , but at a time scale @xmath85 which is independent of the correlation length of the system .",
    "+ for the case @xmath86 the behaviour is much simpler .",
    "advection dominates over diffusion , i.e. the diffusive time scale @xmath87 can not be resolved .",
    "therefore there are only two regimes : for @xmath88 we again find the taylor regime with a linear growth of the ensemble dispersion coefficient , at @xmath84 there is a cross - over to a normal diffusive regime given by @xmath89 because the diffusive effect on the mixing is suppressed by advection , the effective dispersion coefficient is equal to @xmath90 in leading order : @xmath91",
    "the question remains as to whether the effective ensemble - averaged parameters represent the typical behaviour in a single realization of the statistical ensemble . to investigate this problem further",
    ", we calculate the root - mean - square sample - to - sample fluctuations of the centre - of - mass velocity and the dispersion coefficient which are given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath4 stand for the centre - of - mass velocity and the dispersion coefficient of the single realizations as defined in ( [ cmveloc ] ) and ( [ dispcoeff ] ) .",
    "+ again , these quantities can be evaluated explicitly in the given model . as expected , we find that the effective velocity becomes self - averaging in the asymptotic long - time limit , @xmath94 for @xmath3 . in the opposite short - time case , @xmath95 ,",
    "the fluctuations are determined by the fluctuation strength of the disorder @xmath96 . as an example , consider the simple case of an exactly stratified medium , @xmath52 , with point - like injection ( i.e. @xmath97 ) .",
    "the explicit temporal behaviour of the root - mean - square fluctuations is found to be @xmath98 surprisingly , the situation is different in the case of the dispersion coefficient .",
    "it does not become self - averaging even in the asymptotic long - time limit . here , in the limit",
    "@xmath3 the normalized fluctuations @xmath99 tend to a constant finite value for the exactly stratified case @xmath52 as well as for the case @xmath53 where on has normal diffusion in this limit .",
    "+ the explicit results are somewhat cumbersome and not very illustrative .",
    "the derivation and the explicit formulae are , therefore , deferred to [ app2 ] .",
    "figure [ fluk ] illustrates the qualitative behaviour for the case of an exactly stratified medium ( i.e. @xmath52 ) and line injections of different lengths @xmath69 .",
    "as already described in the previous two sections , the short time regime is characterized by an effective dispersion coefficient which is mainly determined by local diffusion .",
    "this quantity does not vary between different realizations of the flow field , the fluctuations therefore obviously vanish for @xmath95 . for @xmath3",
    "the sample - to - sample fluctuations tend to a constant value , irrespective of the initial length of the injection source .",
    "the time - scale on which this asymptotic value is reached is given by @xmath100 , i.e. it is larger for larger @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , an infinitely long source will show no fluctuations at all as all of the fluctuations of the flow field are already experienced right from the start .",
    "+ the non - vanishing sample - to - sample fluctuations demonstrate the fact that the effective dispersion coefficient as defined by ( [ deff_pt ] ) is not a self - averaging quantity , it therefore does not represent the typical behaviour expected in a single representation of the flow field in the two - dimensional stratified model .    [ [ app1 ] ]    in the following appendix , we sketch the basic steps used to derive the results for the temporal behaviour of the transport coefficients discussed in the text .",
    "starting point is the solution of the langevin equation given by ( [ x1 ] ) and ( [ x2 ] ) which is inserted into equation ( [ moments ] ) with @xmath101 and @xmath102 . to perform the necessary white - noise averages , it is useful to replace the flow field by its fourier representation , @xmath103 . after inserting ( [ x1 ] ) and ( [ x2 ] ) ,",
    "the resulting white - noise averages can be calculated using the general formula @xmath104 and an appropriate choice of the arbitrary auxiliary function @xmath105 .",
    "one ends up with @xmath106 and @xmath107 these expressions still depend on the initial positions @xmath108 of the particles . according to ( [ moments ] )",
    "one finally performs the remaining average over the initial distribution @xmath109 .",
    "inserted into the definitions for the effective and ensemble dispersion coefficients ( [ deff_pt ] ) and ( [ dens_pt ] ) , and performing the ensemble average over the disordered flow field , this eventually leads to ( [ triv ] ) , ( [ d11ens ] ) , and ( [ d11eff ] ) . using the explicit form for the initial distribution of equation ( [ initialdistrib ] ) and the expression for the disorder averages ( [ u - average ] ) and ( [ u - corr ] ) then yields the final explicit results given in the text .
