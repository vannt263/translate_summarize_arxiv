    "in the last two decades , triangular antiferromagnetic ( taf ) system was studied extensively using hexagonal abx@xmath9-type antiferromagnets and many types of the phase transitions due to the frustration were found@xcite . within the classical model , the spin structure of the two dimensional heisenberg taf in a magnetic field can not be determined uniquely , because the number of the parameters those are given by the equilibrium conditions are insufficient for the determination of the spin configuration , and thus there remains `` non - trivial continuous degeneracy '' at the ground state@xcite .",
    "chubukov and golosov@xcite suggested that quantum fluctuation can lift the continuous degeneracy at the ground state .",
    "they argued that the heisenberg taf undergoes a successive phase transition as shown in fig.[structures ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in that order with increasing magnetic field .     and @xmath10 within the _ bc_-plane .",

    "the open circles denote cu@xmath11-ions . ]    the intermediate collinear spin structure is stabilized in a finite field region and the magnetization plateau arises at one - third of the saturation magnetization .",
    "the magnetic phase transition of taf induced by the quantum fluctuation was firstly found in cscucl@xmath9@xcite . due to the weak easy - plane anisotropy , the umbrella spin structure as shown in fig.[structures ] ( d )",
    "is realized in the low - field region for @xmath4-axis , and the spin structure such as ( a ) and ( b ) are hidden by the magnetic anisotropy . consequently that cscucl@xmath9 undergoes the field induced phase transition from the structure ( d ) to ( c ) , which is accompanied by the small magnetization `` jump''@xcite .    in cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1",
    ", the arrangement of @xmath12 cu@xmath11-ion can be regarded as the distorted taf in the _ bc_-plane as shown in fig.[bc_lattice]@xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of the isostructural cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 have been investigated extensively by coldea @xcite , and cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 was characterized as the 2-dimensional ( 2d ) taf .",
    "therefore , it is expected that cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 is also described by an @xmath12 2d taf .    in our previous measurements for cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1@xcite , the magnetic",
    "ordering was found at @xmath2k , which is more than twice as large as @xmath13k in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the notable feature of the present system is the magnetization plateau at one - third of the saturation magnetization @xmath14 observed for the magnetic field @xmath3 and the _ c_-axes in the ordered phase as shown in below . since the magnetization plateau is observed for two different field directions , its origin is attributed not to the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy but to the quantum effect . on the other hand ,",
    "no plateau is observed for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the magnetization plateau observed in cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 is the first experimental example of the one - third plateau stabilized by quantum fluctuation in taf . in the present study , we have remeasured the magnetization process in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and performed the elastic neutron scattering experiments in order to determine the magnetic structure of cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 in the field parallel to the _",

    "magnetization data were collected at @xmath15mk in magnetic fields up to 35 t.    the elastic neutron scattering experiments at zero field were performed at her and ltas triple axis spectrometer installed at jaeri , tokai . a single crystal with @xmath163@xmath17 was used for this measurement .",

    "the magnetization saturates at @xmath23 t .",

    "the magnetization is just above @xmath32 . for the magnetic system that does not have uniaxial anisotropy",
    ", the appearance of the magnetization plateau can be attributed to the existence of a quantum excitation energy gap . since the distance of the field between these two peaks @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 is approximately 0.6 t , the energy gap around 2/3 plateau @xmath33 is roughly estimated as @xmath34k which is comparable with the measuring temperature .",

    "the origin of the incommensuration is attributed to the competition between @xmath39 and @xmath10 ( see fig.[bc_lattice ] ) . the ordering vector for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 is @xmath40@xcite . in the classical theory ,",

    "using this equation , we obtain @xmath43 for cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 and @xmath44 for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 .",

    "the neutron scattering cross section reflects the spin component perpendicular to the scattering vector .",
    "since the magnetization process for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are almost the same , it can be deduced that the magnetic moments almost lie in the @xmath47-plane as observed in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1@xcite .",
    "thus , the integrated intensity is expected to be increased with increasing external field , because of the increase of the spin component parallel to the _ c_-axis .",

    "the values of @xmath26 determined from the magnetization and the present neutron scattering measurements show the excellent agreement .",
    "this fact implies obviously that the three - sublattice _ up - up - down _ spin structure parallel to the external field is realized at the plateau .",
    "measurements have been done up to @xmath52 t , however , any evidence of the magnetic phase transition at @xmath53 could not be observed .",
    "the transition field @xmath27 seems to be just above the field range of the present measurement .    for the classical helical spin system ,",
    "a transition from a helical spin structure to a fan structure ( see the illustration in fig.[profiles ] ( b ) ) can occur when an external field is applied in the easy plane@xcite .",
    "the magnetization process of rbcucl@xmath9 which is described as ferromagnetically stacked distorted taf shows the _ helix - fan _ transition for the field parallel to the triangular plane@xcite . for rbcucl@xmath9 , the quantum fluctuation should be suppressed by the three dimensional interaction .",
    "there is possibility that the fan spin structure is also realized in cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 for the field region around the saturation field .",
    "the fan structure is characterized by the two ordering components parallel and perpendicular to the field .",
    "thus , the bragg reflections should split from @xmath50 , if the fan structure was realized in the high field region @xmath54 . if the high - field coplanar structure that has an advantage of quantum fluctuation ( shown in fig.[structures ] ( b ) ) was realized in the field region @xmath54 , the ordering vector does not move from @xmath50 . in order to confirm the spin structure in the field range @xmath54 , the measurements in more high fields are necessary .",
    "we have presented the results of the magnetization process and the elastic neutron scattering experiments on cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 .",
    "it was found that the magnetization curves have the plateaux at approximately 1/3 and 2/3 of the saturation magnetization . at zero field ,",

    ", the value of @xmath45 is increased , and then locked at approximately @xmath56 above the lower edge field @xmath57 t of the magnetization plateau .",
