    "the notion of pathwidth of a matroid has received some recent attention in the matroid theory literature @xcite , @xcite",
    ". this notion has long been studied in the coding theory literature , where it is used as a measure of trellis complexity of a linear code @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , there appears to be no standard coding - theoretic nomenclature for this notion .",
    "it has been called the state complexity of a code in @xcite , but the use of this term there conflicts slightly with its use in @xcite .",
    "so to avoid ambiguity , we will give it a new name here  _ trellis - width _  which acknowledges its roots in trellis complexity .",
    "the relationship between matroid pathwidth and code trellis - width can be made precise as follows . to an arbitrary linear code",
    "@xmath4 over a finite field @xmath0 , we associate a matroid , @xmath5 , which is simply the vector matroid , over @xmath0 , of any generator matrix of the code .",
    "recall that in coding theory , a matrix @xmath6 is called a generator matrix of a code @xmath4 , if @xmath4 is the rowspace of @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , the matroid @xmath5 does not depend on the actual choice of the generator matrix , and so is a characteristic of the code @xmath4 .",
    "the code @xmath4 may in fact be viewed as a representation over @xmath0 of the matroid @xmath5 .",
    "the trellis - width of @xmath4 is simply the pathwidth of @xmath5 ; we will give the precise definition of matroid pathwidth in section  [ pw_section ] .",
    "it has repeatedly been conjectured in the coding theory literature that computing the trellis - width of a linear code over a fixed finite field @xmath0 is np - hard @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) .",
    "this would imply that the corresponding decision problem ( over a fixed finite field @xmath0 )  given a generator matrix for a code @xmath4 over @xmath0 , and a positive integer @xmath1 , deciding whether or not the trellis - width of @xmath4 is at most @xmath1  is np - complete .",
    "this decision problem has been given various names  `` maximum partition rank permutation '' @xcite , `` maximum width '' @xcite and `` trellis state - complexity '' @xcite .",
    "an equivalent statement of the trellis - width conjecture above is the following : given a matrix @xmath7 over @xmath0 , the problem of computing the pathwidth the vector matroid @xmath8 $ ] is np - hard . in this paper , we prove the above statement for any fixed field @xmath0 , not necessarily finite .",
    "our proof is by reduction from the problem of computing the pathwidth of a graph , which is known to be np - hard @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , in particular , computing the trellis - width of a linear code over @xmath0 is np - hard , which settles the aforementioned coding - theoretic conjecture .",
    "the situation is rather different if we weaken the trellis - width decision problem above by _ not _ considering the integer @xmath1 to be a part of the input to the problem . in other words , for a fixed finite field @xmath0 , and a _ fixed _",
    "integer @xmath9 , consider the following problem : +    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given a length-@xmath10 linear code @xmath4 over @xmath0 , decide whether or not @xmath4 has trellis - width at most @xmath1 .",

    "we show that the list of excluded minors for @xmath14 consists of with ground set @xmath15 and rank function @xmath16 to be @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , what we consider to be matroids of pathwidth one would be matroids of pathwidth two in @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , the problem of finding excluded - minor characterizations of @xmath12 for @xmath23 becomes difficult very quickly .",
    "we give a list of excluded minors for @xmath24 , which is probably not complete .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ prelim_section ]",
    ", we lay down the definitions and notation used in the paper . in section  [ np_section ] , we prove that , for any fixed field @xmath0 , the problem of computing the pathwidth of an @xmath0-representable matroid is np - hard , and therefore , so is the problem of computing the trellis - width of a linear code over @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in section  [ bounded_pw_section ] , we consider the class of matroids @xmath12 . we give the complete lists of excluded minors for @xmath14 and the corresponding family of linear codes over @xmath13 having trellis - width at most one .",
    "we also give a partial list of excluded minors for @xmath24 .",
    "we assume familiarity with the basic definitions and notation of matroid theory , as expounded by oxley @xcite .",
    "the main results and proofs in this paper will be given in the language of matroid theory , rather than that of coding theory , as it is easier to do so .",
    "however , as our results may be of some interest to coding theorists , we make an effort in this section to provide the vocabulary necessary to translate the language of matroid theory into that of coding theory .",
    "definitions of coding - theoretic terms not explicitly defined here can be found in any text on coding theory ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be a linear code of length @xmath10 over the finite field @xmath25 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath26 , and the coordinates of @xmath4 are indexed by the integers from the set @xmath27 = \\{1,2,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] as usual .",
    "we will also associate with the coordinates of @xmath4 a set , @xmath28 , of _ coordinate labels _",
    ", so that there is a bijection @xmath29 \\rightarrow e(\\cc)$ ]",
    "label sequence _ of @xmath4 is defined to be the @xmath10-tuple @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . for notational convenience",
    ", we will simply let @xmath32 denote the label sequence of @xmath4 .",
    "unless specified otherwise ( as in the case of code minors and duals below ) , we will , by default , set @xmath28 to be @xmath27 $ ] , and @xmath32 to be the @xmath10-tuple @xmath33 .",
    "in such a case , the label of each coordinate is the same as its index .    given a code @xmath4 over @xmath13 , specified by a generator matrix @xmath6 , we define its _ associated matroid _",
    "@xmath5 to be the vector matroid , @xmath34 $ ] , of @xmath6 .",
    "we identify the ground set of @xmath5 with @xmath28 .",
    "note that if @xmath6 and @xmath35 are distinct generator matrices of the code @xmath4 , then @xmath34 = m[g']$ ] , and hence , @xmath5 is independent of the choice of generator matrix .",
    "thus , any generator matrix of @xmath4 is an @xmath13-representation of @xmath5 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath36 is an @xmath13-representable matroid , and @xmath6 is an @xmath13-representation of @xmath36 , then @xmath37 for the code @xmath4 generated by @xmath6 .",
    "thus , each @xmath13-representable matroid is associated with some code @xmath4 over @xmath13 .    for any code @xmath4 ,",
    "the dual code , @xmath38 , is specified to have the same label sequence as @xmath4 , _",

    "it is a particularly nice fact ( * ? ? ?",
