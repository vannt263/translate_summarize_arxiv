    "lattice monte carlo studies of the qcd phase diagram at finite temperature are still difficult for realistic quark masses , and at finite baryon density are beset by the sign - problem . despite the progress made in the last few years in circumventing these obstacles , such calculations still suffer severe restrictions . in particular , presently available methods are reliable only for small quark chemical potentials , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "these difficulties motivate the search for alternative ways to learn about the phase diagram .",
    "a popular choice is to consider lattice qcd in the strong coupling limit and to study its phase diagram either by analytic mean field methods @xcite or indeed by monte carlo evaluation of the strongly coupled theory @xcite,@xcite , since the sign problem in this case is much milder . in the early days of lattice gauge theory ,",

    "there have also been attempts to go beyond the strong coupling limit @xcite-@xcite , mostly in mean field theory .    in this paper",
    "we address the question whether it is possible to make predictions for the location and nature of the deconfinement phase transition more quantitative by taking corrections into account , and we can answer in the affirmative . in previous work @xcite we have already shown for @xmath1 yang - mills theory that it is quite possible to include spatial plaquettes and to obtain series of several orders . for lattices with temporal extent",
    "@xmath8 , this lead to satisfactory quantitative results for the equation of state up to the phase transition region . however , while the determination of the critical parameters was consistent with monte carlo results and universality arguments , it remained rather imprecise quantitatively . here",
    "we considerably improve on this by using the polyakov loop susceptibility as an observable , rather than the free energy . at a second order phase transition in infinite volume ,",
    "this observable develops a singularity which is well modelled by pad approximants to its series expansion , thus allowing to extract the critical coupling and exponent in satisfactory agreement with numerical results from @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    after a successful test of our method for @xmath1 yang - mills theory ,",

    "this is consistent with the findings from mean field theory @xcite and a monte carlo simulation of the effective theory with the same global symmetries , the 3-state potts model in 3 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the latter is the appropriate effective model also for continuum qcd . since our series furthermore correctly reflects the presence of the @xmath6 transition in the direction of imaginary chemical potential , this would suggest that the qualitative phase structure is correctly represented on lattices as coarse as @xmath129 .",
    "we conclude that strong coupling expansions are able to provide qualitative and , on coarse lattices , quantitative information about the phase structure of lattice qcd beyond mean field theory and the strong coupling limit , which easily extend to finite baryon density .",
