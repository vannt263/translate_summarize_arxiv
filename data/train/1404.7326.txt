    "<S> we demonstrate that in relatively small fields the spin noise spectrum consists of a single peak centered at a zero frequency while an increase of magnetic field results in the formation of the second peak in the spectrum owing to an interplay of the larmor effect of the magnetic field and the exchange interaction between electrons and holes forming excitons . experimental possibilities to observe the exciton spin noise </S>",
