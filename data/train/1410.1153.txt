    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are one of the most energetic events in the universe , now known to be originated by thermonuclear detonations of carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "several possible scenarios leading to a sn ia outburst are currently envisaged , although there might be some overlap between them .",
    "all scenarios have advantages and drawbacks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and there is not yet a general consensus on the leading scenario for sn ia .",
    "in fact , it is well possible that all of them contribute to the total sn ia rate in some unknown fraction .",
    "these scenarios can be listed as follows , according to alphabetical order .",
    "( a)_the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . within this scenario",
    "the wd merges with the hot core of a massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star . in this case",
    "the explosion might occur shortly or a long time after the merger . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite argue that at least @xmath5 , and likely many more , of all sne ia come from the cd scenario .",
    "( b)_the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is based on the merger of two wds .",
    "however , this scenario does not specify the subsequent evolution of the merger product , namely , how long after the merger the explosion of the remnant takes place ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent papers , for example , discuss violent mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) as possible channels of the dd scenario , while others consider very long delays from merger to explosion , e.g. , because rapid rotation keeps the structure overstable @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the delay between merger and explosion in the dd scenario should be @xmath6 .",
    "( c)_the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes mass from a non - degenerate stellar companion and explodes when its mass reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "( d)_the double - detonation mechanism _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "a sub - chandrasekhar mass wd accumulates a layer of helium - rich material coming from a helium donor on its surface .",
    "the helium layer is compressed as more material is accreted and detonates , leading to a second detonation near the center of the co wd ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein , for a recent paper ) .",
    "( e ) _ the wd - wd collision scenario _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario",
    "either a tertiary star brings two wds to collide , or the dynamical interaction occurs in a dense stellar system , where such interactions are likely . in some cases , the collision results in an immediate explosion .",
    "despite some attractive features of this scenario , it can account for at most few per cent of all sne ia @xcite .    finally , it should be mentioned that very recently it has been suggested that pycnonuclear reactions could be able to drive powerful detonations in single co white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this scenario  the so - called _ single wd scenario _  has , however , two important shortcomings .",
    "the first one is that the typical h mass fraction found in detailed evolutionary calculations of co wd progenitors is much smaller than that needed to ignite the core of the wd .",
    "the second drawback of this recently suggested scenario is that most sn ia come from wds with masses near the chandrasekhar limit ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the mass at which ignition may possibly occur in the single wd scenario is @xmath7 .",
    "hence , this scenario would also only account for a small percentage of all sn ia .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there is some overlap between these scenarios .",
    "for example , in the violent merger model @xcite it is possible that during the first stages of the merger of the two co wds the small helium buffer ( @xmath8 ) of the original co wds is ignited . in this case",
    "both the dd scenario and the double detonation mechanism operate simultaneously .",
    "also , the double detonation mechanism might operate in the cd scenario .",
    "in this paper we study the response of a donor star that is a he wd to an exploding co wd with mass below the chandrasekhar limit , @xmath9 .",
    "these parameters fit the double detonation scenario where a very low mass helium shell triggers the sn ia explosion of a co wd @xcite .",
    "we will answer five questions .",
    "( 1 ) does the shock wave induced by the ejecta ignite helium in the wd companion by adiabatic compression or by shock heating ? ( 2 ) is carbon in the ejecta ignited as it is shocked in the outer layers of the he wd ? ( 3 ) can mixing of helium from the donor and carbon from the ejecta lead to vigorous nuclear burning ? ( 4 ) how much helium is entrained by the ejecta ? ( 5 )",
    "what is the morphology of the snr long time after the explosion as the sn ejecta sweep some ambient medium gas ?",
    "to do so we will adopt two masses for the he wd companion .",
    "first we study analytically and then numerically the impact of the sn ia ejecta of a wd of mass @xmath10 residing at @xmath11 from the exploding co wd .",
    "this setting is based on the numerical simulations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , for similar ( but not identical ) progenitors that might lead to sn ia . in a second step , and following @xcite and @xcite we also consider a he wd of @xmath12 at an orbital separation of @xmath13 .",
    "there are a number of simulations studying similar processes to those studied by us , but in the sd scenario .",
    "@xcite conducted 2d simulations to study the impact of a sn ia on a hydrogen - rich non - degenerate companion .",
    "they found that several tenths of a solar mass of hydrogen are striped from the companion into a cone with a solid angle of @xmath14 behind the companion , depending on the type of companion .",
    "@xcite was interested in the effect of the companion on the light curve shortly , up to several days , after the explosion .",
    "@xcite found the striped hydrogen mass to be much lower , and compatible with limits from observations .",
    "@xcite took the companion in their 2d simulations to be a non - degenerate helium star .",
    "@xcite extended the study to 3d simulations and to hydrogen - rich companions .",
    "@xcite were interested in the evolution of a main sequence companion after the passage of the sn shock .",
    "we reproduce the dense conical surface found to be formed behind the companion by @xcite and @xcite , but we continue to follow the interaction of this cone with the ism . we note that none of the papers listed above continued their simulations to the stage of interaction with the ism , as we do in the present study .",
    "neither they included nuclear reactions in the companion as a result of the shock . here",
    "we study the interaction of a type ia supernova with a he  wd to examine he ignition and the snr morphology .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ejecta ] we discuss and quantify the properties of the material ejected from the disrupted co wd , while in section [ sec : ignition ] we assess analytically the possibility of an explosive ignition . in section [ sec : numeric ]",
    "we conduct 2d axisymmetrical numerical simulations of the interaction of the ejecta with the he wd , and we examine nuclear reactions and helium entrainment .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and their implications to the double detonation scenario .",
    "to facilitate an analytical estimate we assume that the sn ia ejecta is already in homologous expansion , and we take the profile of @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant which depends on the mass and kinetic energy of the ejecta , @xmath17 @xmath18 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a parameter given by @xmath21 the maximum velocity of the sn ia ejecta is @xmath22 .",
    "we compared this analytical profile with @xmath23 and @xmath24 with models 7d and 9c from @xcite , who calculated the explosion of wd models .",
    "the maximum velocity in the analytical profile used here is @xmath25 .",
    "we found our model to be practically identical to their model 7d for the outer @xmath26 of the ejecta , and somewhat slower than model 9d in that mass range .",
    "for inner mass coordinates the analytical fit is slower than models 7d and 9c of @xcite . as the outer layers determine whether the companion will be ignited , using models 7d or 9c of @xcite will result in an easier ignition of the companion . for that , and",
    "to keep the profile simple and flexible to changes , we use the analytical profile as given above both in the analytical and the numerical calculations .    for the analytical estimates derived in section [ sec : ignition ]",
    "we now estimate the maximum ram pressure of the ejecta on the he  wd . a cold he wd of mass @xmath27 has a radius of @xmath28 .",
    "as it overflows its roche lobe , with a co  wd companion of @xmath29 , in a stable mass transfer the orbital separation is @xmath30 times this distance , namely , @xmath31 .",
    "however , detailed numerical calculations show that for a powerful ignition to occur the mass transfer must be unstable @xcite , and the surface of the he  wd that fills the roche lobe can be as close as @xmath32 to the exploding co  wd @xcite .    the ram pressure of the ejecta at a distance @xmath33 from the explosion at time @xmath34 after explosion is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the maximum ram pressure is achieved at time @xmath37 , and its value is @xmath38 at @xmath39 and @xmath40 the pressure drops to a value of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the first material hits the wd at time @xmath43  km  s@xmath44 , with a ram pressure of @xmath45 .",
    "overall , the phase in which the pressure is larger than @xmath46 lasts for about two seconds at @xmath47 from the explosion .",
    "the density of the ejecta at maximum ram pressure is @xmath48",
    "[ f : profileprho ] shows two of the physical quantities of a @xmath27 he wd which are relevant for our study , namely the pressure and density as a function of the mass coordinate @xmath49 .",
    "this specific model corresponds to a wd with central temperature @xmath50  k , which results in a surface luminosity @xmath51 , an otherwise typical luminosity of field white dwarfs , an effective temperature @xmath52 , and corresponds to a sequence which was evolved performing full evolutionary calculations that consider the main energy sources and processes of chemical abundance changes during white dwarf evolution @xcite .",
    "there are three possible ways in which the he  wd or the co ejecta might be ignited :    \\(1 ) _ shock ignition of helium .",
    "_ it turns out that , for the model wd used here , he is shocked and ignited in a region where both thermal and radiation pressures play a role . in this region @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "a good estimate of the temperature in the shocked region of the he  wd can be obtained by equating the radiation pressure to the ram pressure given in equation ( [ eq : pramm ] ) : @xmath55 the burning time - scale of pure helium at these conditions is @xmath56 , just a little longer than the timescale of the dynamical flow , defined as the ejecta speed divided by the he wd radius , @xmath57 . for these parameters ,",
    "ignition conditions are reached for @xmath58 .",
    "this is compatible with the numerical results to be described in section [ subsec : massivewd ] , where the exact radius is found .",
    "\\(2 ) _ carbon burning in the shocked ejecta . _",
    "the second possibility we explore is the ignition of carbon - rich material of the ejecta as it is shocked upon hitting the he wd .",
    "the post - shock pressure of the ejecta is dominated by radiation pressure .",
    "the temperature at maximum ram pressure is given by equation ( [ eq : temphewd ] ) .",
    "for a distance to the explosion @xmath59 we find the temperature to be @xmath60 .",
    "for this temperature we expect that carbon will be burned .",
    "nevertheless , we need to compare the burning time with the dynamical timescale of the flow , @xmath61 . for the scaling and parameters used in sect .",
    "[ sec : ejecta ] the ejecta density at the time of maximum ram pressure and at a distance of @xmath62 from the center of explosion is @xmath63 .",
    "if the carbon mass is half of the mass of the ejecta and the compression factor is @xmath64 , then the post - shock density in the carbon - rich region is @xmath65 . as in this scenario",
    "the companion star is much closer to the center of the explosion than the corresponding one of the single - degenerate scenario , the density of the shocked ejecta will be much higher , and the burning timescale much shorter .",
    "we find that the carbon burning timescale for this density and a typical temperature @xmath66 to be about one second .",
    "these temperatures and densities are achieved near the stagnation point in a small region of size @xmath67  see below .",
    "the outflow time from this region is @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the outflow time is shorter than the burning time scale . in the numerical results to be described",
    "next we obtain no significant carbon burning , showing that the outflow time of carbon from the shocked region is indeed very short .",
    "this is unlike the case in which helium belonging to the he  wd is shocked inside the he  wd and can not flow outward .",
    "_ ( 3 ) igniting helium by mixing ejecta .",
    "_ even if carbon is not ignited , mixing of the ejecta at @xmath69 with helium might , in principle , even if helium was not ignited by the shock , power a thermonuclear runaway . in our numerical simulations mixing is not sufficiently deep to cause ignition by this process ( see section [ sec : numeric ] ) .    for the case of a low - mass he  wd we repeated all these calculations and we found that none of the previously described processes drive a powerful nuclear outburst , and thus the evolution in this case should mostly consist of a purely hydrodynamical flow . as it will be explained in detail in the next section ,",
    "full hydrodynamical numerical simulations confirm this .",
    "we use version 4.2.2 of the flash gas - dynamical numerical code @xcite .",
    "the flash code has been used before for a similar study in the sd scenario , in 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite .",
    "the widely used ` flash ` code is a publicly available code for supersonic flow suitable for astrophysical applications .",
    "the simulations are done using the unsplit ppm solver of ` flash ` .",
    "we use 2d axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates with an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) grid .",
    "the origin of the grid , @xmath70 , is taken at the center of the explosion .",
    "in all the figures shown below the symmetry axis of the grid is the vertical axis . the axisymmetric grid forces us to neglect the orbital relative velocity of the he  wd and the exploding co  wd . in any case , the orbital velocity is much smaller than the ejecta velocity , and will have virtually no effect on our conclusions . for the equation of state we use the helmholtz eos @xcite .",
    "this eos includes contributions from partial degenerate electrons and positrons , radiation , and non - degenerate ions .",
    "we use the aprox19 nuclear network of 19 isotopes @xcite in ` flash ` .",
    "the hydrodynamic module is coupled to the nuclear network by setting the parameter ` enucdtfactor=0.1 ` in ` flash ` @xcite , and shock burning is disabled by default .",
    "self gravity is included using the new multipole solver in ` flash ` with order @xmath71 .",
    "we run our collision simulations with two different resolutions as a test for convergence and found no appreciable difference .",
    "in addition , we run a low resolution simulation on a much larger grid to follow the long time evolution of the ejecta . for the high - resolution simulations the minimum cell size was @xmath72 with a total of 10 levels of amr refinement . for the low - resolution simulations the minimum cell size was @xmath73 .",
    "in addition we lowered the resolution in the large grid simulation to @xmath74 from initially @xmath75 after @xmath76 from the explosion to reduce the computational time .",
    "the initial he  wd mass , radius , and distance from the center of the explosion in the two simulated cases to be presented below are @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the low- and high - mass he  wds , respectively .",
    "the wds are cold , and the radius of the @xmath10 wd is somewhat smaller than the hotter wd presented in fig .  [",
    "f : profileprho ] .",
    "these models were built with version 6022 of the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ; @xcite ) .    initially , the ejecta in our simulations is homologous expanding according to equations ( [ eq : rhosn])-([eq : aconst ] ) , with @xmath24 and @xmath79 .",
    "the maximum velocity at the front of the ejecta is set to @xmath25 .",
    "its outer radius from the center of explosion is set to almost touch the he  wd .",
    "ideally one should start from a real explosion of the co wd .",
    "but we limit ourselves in the present study to explore the basic processes .",
    "we estimate the internal energy as follows . at shock breakout , about half",
    "the energy is thermal , half is kinetic .",
    "as the gas expands , thermal energy drops as @xmath80 . by the time it hits the he  wd the thermal energy",
    "is one third of its initial value .",
    "most of it went to accelerate the gas to almost the terminal velocity .",
    "the kinetic energy is now @xmath81 of the initial energy , and the thermal energy is @xmath82 . over all , the kinetic energy is 5 times or more higher than the thermal energy . in the simulations we therefore set the thermal energy to be @xmath83 of kinetic energy at @xmath84 from the start of the simulations .",

    "we ran our simulations with two different chemical compositions . in a first set of simulations we assumed that the ejecta was entirely made of nickel , while in a second set we adopted c / o .",
    "we found that our results are not sensitive to the adopted composition .",
    "( see version v1 of this paper on astro - ph for figures with c / o composition ) .",
    "finally , we mention that radiative cooling and photon diffusion are not important for the problem simulated here , and hence have not been included in our calculations .      in the case",
    "in which a low - mass he - wd is considered , nuclear reactions are not significant and three distinct stages of the interaction can be differentiated .",
    "( i ) the early interaction phase , when temperatures of the shocked gas are at maximum , and the ejecta flows around the he  wd .",
    "( ii ) the intermediate phase , when the shock breaks out from the back of the wd and ejects helium from it .",
    "( iii ) the late time phase , when expansion is homologous until the ejecta sweep a non - negligible ambient mass and adopts the shape of an old snr . we ran the simulations using both the low- and high - resolutions grids .",
    "this was done for checking numerical convergence . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the low - resolution grid was designed to cover a larger region around the interacting wds , and thus was used to follow the evolution of the snr at late times . in the overlapping regions , the results of the two simulations with different resolutions were found to be the same .    _ the early stage . _ in fig .",

    "the first two features fade as more ambient gas ( ism ) is swept .",
    "let us note that the main result here does not depend much on whether the he  wd is younger and hotter , hence has a larger radius .",
    "it will simply have somewhat larger orbital separation .",
    "but as the double - detonation model requires stable roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , the solid angle covered by the he  wd will be about the same , and so is the conical shape formed behind it ( see @xcite ) . here",
    "we find the angular size ( from symmetry axis to conical surface ) of the cone to be @xmath115 .",
    "@xcite found in their study of the single - degenerate scenario that the companion creates a ` hole ' in the supernova debris with an angular size of @xmath116 , depending on the part of the ejecta , and @xcite found an angular size of @xmath117 .",
    "most similar to our structure of the cone are the results of @xcite , where the angular size of the cone is @xmath118 , and of @xcite where in many cases the angular size of the cone is @xmath119 ( in some 3d simulations there is no well defined cone ) .",
    "all these results agree with each other within the range of different initial parameters .",
    "although some snrs show some dipole deviations from sphericity , we are not aware of any snr that shows such a conical imprint morphology",
    ". one might think of sn1006 , but examining the prominent features we find that sn1006 can not be explained by such an interaction .",
    "( a ) snr sn1006 has a flat front",
    ". however , there is a hydrogen - rich optical filament along the flat front .",
    "the flat front seems to have been formed by an asymmetrical external interaction formed by asymmetrical ism .",
    "( b ) in sn1006 the x - ray intensity of the flat front is lower than the front on the orthogonal directions , but not lower than the other side of the snr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , sn1006 does not show a uniform intensity along the spherical parts not including the flat front .",
    "( c ) a dense conical surface in the interior is not observed in sn1006 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ( d ) as can be seen from figure 9 of @xcite , the volume behind the flat front is rich in neon and oxygen , and it is not poor in ejecta . we conclude that the structure of the snr sn1006 , despite the flat front on one side , is incompatible with the morphology expected from the double - detonation scenario .     the results of asymmetrical snr obtained here applies to all single - degenerate scenarios as well .",
    "the dd scenario also leads to asymmetrical explosion if it occurs too shortly after the merger of the two wds .",
    "overall , it seems that the symmetrical structures of most snrs ia hint that when it explodes the wd is all alone .",
    "this is compatible with the cd scenario . in cases where a circumstellar gas is present and influences the snr morphology , e.g. , in forming two opposite ` ears ' as in the kepler sn remnant , the cd scenario seems to do better than other scenarios as well @xcite .     in some snrs",
    "one can identify two opposite ` ears ' that divert the snr from being spherical ( see @xcite for a list of objects ) .",
    "these ` ears ' might be formed by jets in the pre - explosion evolution , as expected for some snrs in the cd scenario @xcite .",
    "these snrs are not perfectly spherical , but the asymmetry is like a quadrupole , and not as a dipole as expected if a companion influence the shaping of the snr .",
    "a word of caution is in place here .",
    "our conclusions hold as long as there are no processes that erase the asymmetry caused by the companion .",
    "if the initial asymmetry is large , e.g. , as proposed by @xcite , then the morphology of snrs discussed above implies that there is a process that erases asymmetry .",
    "for example , radioactive heating of dense regions can cause them to expand and fill empty regions .",
    "however , three points should be made regarding the homogenizing effect on the flow by radioactive heating .",
    "( 1 ) the change in velocity and density cause a deviation from the purely homologous density profile of about 10 per cent @xcite .",
    "such small variations will not erase the dipole asymmetry .",
    "( 2 ) the nickel is concentrated in the center , while we are interested in the outer layers that are first to interact with the ism .",
    "( 3 ) the observed very low level continuum polarization at the first few weeks in sn  2012fr points to a symmetrical explosion that is inconsistent with the merger - induced explosion scenario @xcite .",
    "namely , it seems that explosion is not far from spherical from the beginning .     over all , despite the caution one must take at this stage , the assumptions and approximations made here lead to a fair representation of the snr that result from the double detonation scenario with low mass he  wd as the donor .      in this case",
    "we place a @xmath120 he  wd at closer distances than the @xmath121 one , as described in section [ subsec : setup ] .",
    "we find that the helium wd is ignited when the distance of its center to the center of the co wd is @xmath122 , and that practically no burning occurs if it is placed at larger distances .    in figs .",

    "( using co composition for the ejecta does not change the results ; see version v1 of the paper on astro - ph . ) .",
    "the lighter - red is the nickel mass fraction that is synthesized in the he wd .",
    "white regions are composed of he  wd gas that did not form nickel .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    note that this calculation shares some features in common with the evolution in the case in which a low - mass he  wd is considered , but also some noticeable differences . in particular , although the evolution of the hydrodynamical flow is apparently similar , the key difference is the much larger temperatures attained during the interaction between the ejecta and the he  wd .",
    "ignition of helium occurs just before @xmath85 , as can be seen in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure043 ] .",
    "the ignited helium raises the temperature and a thermonuclear detonation occurs , in accordance with the theoretical estimates presented in section [ sec : ignition ] . by the last panel",
    "the explosion has ended .",
    ", just after he ignition .",
    "the velocities are proportional to the arrow length , with the inset showing an arrow for @xmath88 the blue line shows when the helium fraction is @xmath125 .",
    "the figure is for the case in which a he  wd of mass @xmath10 is adopted.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    it is interesting to note as well the important role of radiation pressure in this simulation , as it should be expected given the considerations explained in section  [ sec : ignition ] . to corroborate this , in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure043 ] we show the total pressure ( top ) and ratio of radiation to total pressure ( bottom ) at the time of helium ignition , @xmath85 .",
    "it can be seen that at the ignition point the radiation pressure dominates , but thermal pressure is not negligible .",
    "also , the total pressure in the ignition region is @xmath126 , comparable to the estimate given in equation ( [ eq : pramm ] ) if we adopt @xmath127 .    given that the temperatures attained during the interaction between the ejecta and the massive he  wd are rather high , extensive nuclear processing occurs , and a substantial amount of nickel is synthesized .",
    "nickel first appears in a region laying between the center of the he  wd and the surface facing the ejecta . note that after a few seconds most of the material of the he  wd has been processed to nickel",
    "this contradicts observations , as the snr will be highly asymmetrical , as in the violent merger simulation presented by @xcite .",
    "we find that not all helium is burned and @xmath128 of helium is ejected from the exploding he  wd .",
    "this also contradicts some observations , e.g. , @xcite found a limit of @xmath129 of helium in sn ia 1994d . in a recent study",
    "@xcite put a much stronger limit of @xmath130 of ablated mass from a helium - rich companion to sn  2011fe and to sn  2014j .",
    "we conclude that the presence of a relatively close by , @xmath131 , he  wd donor to the exploding co  wd leads to an explosion that has characteristics contradicting observations of sne ia .",
    "accordingly , the double - detonation scenario seems to do not apply to normal sne ia .",
    "we have actually simulated here a ` triple detonation scenario ' .",
    "the three stages are : he detonation on the surface of a wd , then a co detonation , and finally a he detonation in the he wd companion .",
    "the outcome is a total ejected mass of about the chandrasekhar mass , although the two wds were each much below the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the ejected mass and synthesized nickel are larger than those inferred for sn  2005e @xcite , or ` calcium - rich gap ' transients in general ( @xcite ; for a recent list of transients see @xcite ) .",
    "we also expect iron group elements , which are not generally observed in sn  2005e and the other ` calcium - rich gap ' transients @xcite .",
    "one of these gap transients have hydrogen @xcite , which is not expected in the tripe - detonation scenario .",
    "such transients are more likely to come from helium detonation on a wd without ignition of the he  wd companion @xcite .",
    "the presence of helium might lead to classification of the event as a sn ib , but with high helium - burning products that will make it a peculiar sn ib .",
    "such sne might be related to the peculiar low - luminosity sne ib with relatively strong ca spectral lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , following @xcite , suggests that the progenitor system for these sne is a double wd system where at least one wd has a significant he abundance .",
    "we here raise the possibility that some ca - rich peculiar ib sne come from the triple - detonation scenario .",
    "this speculation deserves a separate study . in any case",
    ", we expect the triple - detonation scenario to be very rare .",
    "we have studied the impact of the ejecta of an exploding co wd on the donor star in the double - detonation scenario for the formation of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) .",
    "we have done so for two masses of the secondary he wd , namely @xmath26 and @xmath10 , assuming that the sn ia ejecta is already in homologous expansion when it hits the surface of the secondary wd .",
    "the first part of our study was done using analytical estimates , while in the second part of our work we performed full 2-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations , employing the ` flash ` code .",
    "our most relevant results can be summarized as follows .",
    "for the case in which a massive he  wd ( @xmath10 ) is considered , our analytical estimates predicted that the material of the he  wd would undergo a powerful thermonuclear runaway when the ejected material of the exploding co  wd interacts with outer layers of the donor wd ( sect . [ sec : ignition ] ) .",
    "our analytical predictions are confirmed by our detailed hydrodynamical calculations that also give us the evolution with time of the flow , where ignition occurs , the amount of nickel formed , and the mass of helium ejected by the interaction ( figs .",
    "[ fig : imagedensity3e9highmass ] - [ fig : pressure043 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the mass of ejected helium ( @xmath132 ) would have been easily detected in observations , implying that this scenario seems to be ruled out for standard sn ia .",
    "for the binary system containing a low - mass he  wd ( @xmath26 ) no significant nuclear processing occurs , and the evolution consists of an almost pure hydrodynamical flow . the evolution can be divided in three distinct phases . during the initial phase a shock runs through the outer layers of the he  wd , and the sn ejecta flows around the secondary star , forming a region with conical shape ( fig .",
    "[ fig : densp1lowmass ] ) . in the intermediate stage , just after the shock breaks - out from the back side of the he  wd , some material from the he  wd is ejected but most of it falls back at later times , while a conical dense surface continues expanding ( fig . [ fig : densp2lowmass ] ) .",
    "finally , during the late stages of the evolution the sn ejecta interacts with the ambient medium , which we numerically set to a very high density to mimic interaction with the ism hundreds of years later . during this phase",
    "the conical flow previously described forms a ring of high pressure , which accelerates material towards the low - density conical region ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : densp3lowmass ] ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical evolution previously described has observational consequences . in an attempt to model the morphology of the resulting snr we integrated the density squared of the hot gas for two viewing angles and two times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imagep3lowmass ] .",
    "the integrated ejecta density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imagep3onlyejectalowmass ] ) .",
    "we found that the shape of the snr , that contains a prominent flat region in the direction of the shadow of the he  wd , is at odds with known snr morphologies .    in conclusion ,",
    "our study supports previous claims that the double - detonation scenario can at best be responsible for a very small fraction of all sn ia .",
    "specifically , @xcite claimed that the double - detonation scenario can account for only a small fraction of all sn ia , because the parameter space leading to explosion is small .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , argued that the double - detonation model can account for a large fraction of sn ia .",
    "for that to be the case , most ( @xmath133 ) of the donors in the study of @xcite are he  wd .",
    "our results show that he  wd donors lead to explosions that are in contradiction with the observed morphology of the snrs of type ia sn , and that if the he  wd is massive ( @xmath134 ) , not all helium is burned and , consequently , would be spectroscopically observed , again in contradiction with observations .",
    "there is another severe problem with the double detonation scenario @xcite .",
    "as @xcite showed , most exploding wds in the double - detonation scenario are of mass @xmath135 .",
    "this is in a strong contrast with recent claims that most sn ia masses are peak around @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also claimed that at least @xmath137 of all sn ia come from near chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath138 ) wds .",
    "all in all , we conclude that the double - detonation scenario can lead to explosions , but their characteristics are not typical of those of sn ia .",
    "thus , sne ia must be originated by other channels , most likely the core - degenerate and the double - degenerate scenarios @xcite .",
