    "the strong quenching of jets observed experimentally in high - energy nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider  @xcite and the large hadron collider  @xcite has been interpreted as an indication for the formation of an opaque , deconfined plasma of qcd matter , in which the leading partons suffer medium - induced energy loss .",
    "the energy loss of relativistic partons is expected to be dominated by gluon radiation  @xcite .",
    "important in this context is the possibility of a destructive interference between the radiation amplitudes of multiple deflections during the formation time of gluons  @xcite and the influence of the dielectric polarization of the plasma  @xcite .",
    "both effects lead to a modification of the gluon radiation spectrum and , consequently , of the radiative energy loss .",
    "so far , however , the possible influence of damping of radiation in an absorptive plasma has been neglected in these considerations .",
    "recently  @xcite , the impact of polarization and absorption effects in a medium on the radiative energy loss of a relativistic charge @xmath0 has been studied in linear response theory .",
    "thereby , the influence of multiple deflections of the charge is incorporated in line with the original approach in  @xcite .",
    "these investigations can be viewed as abelian approximation for the dynamics of a colour charge in the qcd plasma .",
