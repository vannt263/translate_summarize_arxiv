    "supernovae and their remnants have long been identified as likely sites of galactic cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "evidence for electron acceleration first came from observations of radio synchrotron radiation .",
    "the observation of nonthermal x - ray emission from sn 1006 by _ asca _ has provided evidence for electron acceleration up to @xmath3 tev ( koyama 1995 ; reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "the proton cosmic ray component is more difficult to observe , but it has long been recognized that pion decays from collisions with interstellar gas could give an observable flux of @xmath4 gev photons .",
    "initial estimates of @xmath2-ray emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) , concentrating on the component resulting from pion decays , were made by chevalier ( 1977 ) , blandford & cowie ( 1982 ) , and drury , aharonian , & vlk ( 1994 ) . when @xmath2-ray emission was apparently detected from snrs by _",
    "cgro _ , the @xmath2-ray spectrum could not be fitted by a pure pion decay spectrum and some other component was needed ( esposito 1996 ; sturner 1997 ; gaisser , protheroe , & stanev 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to the pion decays , the relevant processes are bremsstrahlung emission of relativistic electrons and inverse compton emission .",
    "gaisser ( 1998 ) modeled these processes in detail in order to fit the observed @xmath2-ray spectra of the remnants ic  443 and @xmath2 cygni .",
    "they assumed acceleration to a power law spectrum in the shock front and determined the spectral index , electron to proton ratio , and the upper energy cutoff .",
    "the evolution of the relativistic component in a supernova remnant has been modeled by a number of groups .",
    "sturner ( 1997 ) assumed particle acceleration in the shock front with an @xmath5 energy spectrum and followed the evolution of the particle spectrum .",
    "their snr model was homogeneous : a factor 4 density jump at the shock front , constant density in the interior , and a constant magnetic field in the interior .",
    "their shock acceleration model had a diffusion length parameter that was important for the maximum energy reached by the particles .",
    "they modeled the nonthermal emission from ic  443 as synchrotron emission in the radio and bremsstrahlung in @xmath2-rays .",
    "de jager & mastichiadis ( 1997 ) dealt with the same processes in w44 , as well as inverse compton emission .",
    "they noted that the observed radio spectrum is flatter than would be expected from shock acceleration of newly injected particles and suggested that the particles originated from a pulsar in the supernova remnant .",
    "recently , ostrowski ( 1999 ) showed that second - order electron acceleration by the turbulent medium just after the shock could flatten the spectra to account for the radio observations of ic  443 . baring ( 1999 ) presented calculations of the broad - band emission from nonlinear shock models of shell - type snrs .",
    "they used sedov adiabatic shock dynamics in a homogeneous medium and a monte carlo simulation of the particle acceleration taking into account the nonlinear shock structure .",
    "the set of models considered by baring ( 1999 ) covers the range of shock speeds 490 @xmath6 4000 km s@xmath1 and ambient medium number densities 10@xmath7 1 @xmath8 .",
    "massive stars that are the likely progenitors of core collapse supernovae are expected to be spatially correlated with molecular clouds .",
    "the remnants that are likely to be @xmath2-ray sources in _ cgro _ observations ( esposito 1996 ) also show evidence for interaction with molecular gas .",
    "chevalier ( 1999 ) recently studied the evolution of supernova remnants in molecular clouds and concluded that many aspects of the multiwavelength observations could be understood in a model where the remnants evolve in the interclump medium of a molecular cloud , which has density of @xmath9 h atoms @xmath8 , and become radiative at radii @xmath10 pc .",
    "the compression in the radiative shell is limited by the magnetic field .",
    "molecular emission occurs when the radiative shell collides with molecular clumps .",
    "ic  443 is the remnant with the best evidence for high energy emission and also shows clear evidence for interaction of the shock with a molecular cloud ( e.g. , burton 1990 ; van dishoeck 1993 ; cesarsky 1999 ) .",
    "most of the current models of particle acceleration in snrs have dealt with adiabatic remnants in a homogeneous medium ( see , however , the model of boulares & cox 1988 for the cygnus loop and the model of jones & kang 1993 ) .",
    "in contrast , our aims here are to examine in detail the nonthermal emission of radiative supernova remnants in molecular clouds using a kinetic model of electron injection , acceleration and propagation , including the inhomogeneous structure deduced from multiwavelength snr observations .",
    "we use global mhd ( magnetohydrodynamic ) models of supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds as described by chevalier ( 1999 ) , including the theory of radiative shock structure by shull & mckee ( 1979 ) and the kinetic model of electron injection and acceleration by shocks from bykov & uvarov ( 1999 ) .",
    "the model described here is relevant to the mixed - morphology snrs ( rho & petre 1998 ) , if they are interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "these remnants comprise a sizable fraction of the galactic snr population .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in   2 , we treat the energy spectrum of energetic electrons as they pass through the regions associated with a radiative shock wave .",
    "we include the shock acceleration of particles from the thermal pool . in   3 , we present calculations of the nonthermal emission from the relativistic particles , including emission from shocks in clumps as well as emission from the radiative shock wave in the interclump region .",
    "our model is specifically applied to the well - observed remnant ic 443 , although we expect it to more generally apply to other supernova remnants in molecular clouds .",
    "we also examine the ionization by energetic particles and the energy involved in the relativistic particles .",
    "a discussion of results and future propects is in   4 .",
    "a detailed discussion of expected range of densities , shock velocities and magnetic fields determined from multiwavelength observations of ic 443 , w44 and 3c391 was given in the paper by chevalier ( 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the structure of the flow expected in a radiative shock can be divided into the following regions ( see , e.g. , draine & mckee 1993 ) : + _ ( i ) _ preshock gas ionized and heated by _ uv _ ( ultraviolet ) emission and fast particles from the shock ; + _ ( ii ) _ shock transition region ; + _ ( iii ) _ postshock cooling layer ; + _ ( iv ) _ cold shell of swept - up gas ; + _ ( v ) _ hot low density gas interior to the shock .",
    "+ radiative shocks are subject to thermal instabilities ( chevalier & imamura 1982 ; bertschinger 1986 ) as well as dynamical instabilities ( vishniac 1983 ; blondin et al .",
    "although the effect of inhomogeneous magnetic fields on the stability of radiative shock flow is yet to be studied , mhd turbulence is expected in such a system .",
    "the transport and acceleration of nonthermal particles in the violent snr environment are governed by the mhd flow and depend on the ionization structure and on the spectrum of mhd turbulence .",
