    "what is the nature of this structure and why is the distribution of young stars so complicated ?    in this paper",
    "we shall focus on one aspect of the galactic - centre disc(s ) , their substantial warp .",

    "we argue that the most important torques are those that arise from the mass distribution of the cluster stars after averaging over orbital phase and apsidal angle ( vector resonant relaxation ) and that the self - gravity of the disc suppresses the excitation of small - scale normal modes so that vector resonant relaxation warps the disc , rather than thickening it . in ",
    "[ sec : timescale ] , we discuss the timescales of various processes in the galactic centre , and establish that vector resonant relaxation with the old cluster stars is significant for the galactic - centre disc(s ) , whereas most other dynamical relaxation processes ( e.g. , scalar resonant relaxation , two - body relaxation , etc . ) are not . in  [ sec : laplag ] , we derive an analytic solution to the time evolution of an initially flat stellar disc , based on the following approximations : ( i ) the orbital period and the apsidal precession period are much shorter than the timescale for the warping of the disc , so we can average the motion over the orbital phase and apsidal angle ; ( ii ) external torques on these timescales are generated exclusively by the orbit - averaged mass distribution of the cluster stars ( i.e. , vector resonant relaxation ) , ( iii ) the eccentricities of the disc stars are negligible ; ( iv ) the warping angle is small ( in particular , the relative inclination between any two disc stars is small compared to their fractional difference in semi - major axis ) ; ( v ) the orbits of cluster stars are uncorrelated and independent of the disc ( i.e. , the back - reaction of the disc on the cluster is negligible ) ; ( vi ) the cluster is spherical on average ( i.e. , the non - spherical component of the cluster mass distribution is due solely to poisson fluctuations from individual stars ) . in this case",
    ", the problem reduces to laplace  lagrange theory , in which the secular evolution of the disc is described by a quadratic hamiltonian , and the disc is equivalent to a system of point masses interconnected with springs and driven by the external forces from the cluster .",

    "the long - wavelength modes are well represented by the average waveform , while shorter wavelength modes in a single realization deviate more strongly from the mean ( compare the orange lines , @xmath454 , in the left and centre panels of figure [ fig : modes ] ) .",
    "the right panel shows the probability distribution for the saturation times @xmath455 for various realizations of the disc .",
    "the probability distribution is sharply peaked for @xmath239 ( for each fixed @xmath246 ) with a fwhm of about @xmath421 . therefore , @xmath239 can be predicted from the surface - density distribution without knowing the locations and masses of disc stars .",
    "the normal modes @xmath456 are still growing ( @xmath457 ) , @xmath458 is just around saturation , and all other modes are saturated .    these considerations and the theory presented in ",
    "[ sec : coherent ] allow us to make general remarks on the expected warping of the disc .",
    "recall that modes in the oscillating phase  with either the coherence time or the disc age less than the saturation time @xmath445  are suppressed in amplitude relative to lower frequency modes by @xmath310 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : correlatedgrowth ] ] and  [ sec : warp ] below ) .",
    "therefore if the external torques on the disc stars do not depend too strongly on radius , the shape of the disc is expected to be dominated by long - wavelength modes .",
    "there are presently few observational constraints on the maximum radial extent of the disc , and its evolution would be different if it extended to larger radii .",
    "as an example , the top ( red ) curves in figure [ fig : lambdahist ] show the histogram of saturation times for a hypothetical disc extrapolated to @xmath459 with the same power - law surface density distribution . in this case , there are many more modes still in the growing phase at the current age of @xmath125 .",
    "however , the characteristic wavelengths of these additional modes are larger than @xmath34 , and the saturation timescales of the smaller wavelength modes are not very different from the case in which the disc is truncated at @xmath34 . therefore we expect that our predictions of the shape of the warped disc at radii @xmath460 are robust , and independent of whether or not there is an outer disc .",
    "we model the torques on the disc from the star cluster as follows : ( i ) as described above , since the torque distribution is a gaussian random process , we may assume that all cluster stars have the effective mass @xmath103 , as defined following equation ( [ eq : trelax ] ) ; we typically assume @xmath158 .",

    "( iv ) we assume a disc age of @xmath125 .    alternatively , random realizations of cluster torques may be generated by sampling an @xmath25-dimensional gaussian distribution ( where @xmath25 is the number of disc stars ) with a covariance matrix @xmath466 given by equations ( [ eq : sigmaij2])([eq : sigmaij3 ] ) .",
    "we can decompose the torques into independent driving modes , corresponding to the eigenvectors of @xmath466 .",
    "these driving modes , shown in figure [ fig : excitationmodes ] , are a property of the spherical cluster of old stars and hence are distinct from the normal modes of the disc shown in figure [ fig : modes ] .",
    "we find that the corresponding eigenvalues , which correspond to the mean squared amplitude of the particular driving mode , span a vast range , some 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "remarkably , the five longest wavelength driving modes typically contribute 90% of the total torque .",
    "therefore , the cluster excites the disc predominantly through a few long - wavelength driving modes .",
    "as described at the end of  [ sec : incoh ] , the coherence time of the torques from the cluster can be shorter than the disc age depending on the radius .",
    "the two are equal at a radius around @xmath467 . nevertheless , to avoid excessive complication  both conceptual and numerical  in our simulations",
    "we shall assume that the coherence time is long compared to the disc age , so that the perturbing forces @xmath289 , @xmath290 can be regarded as time - independent and the formulae in  [ sec : coherent ] can be used to calculate the disc evolution .",
    "this simplification has a smaller impact on the evolution of long wavelength modes @xmath468 , while it may be important for short wavelength modes close to the center . to account properly for the temporal evolution of the torques from the cluster would require solving simultaneously for the secular evolution of both the cluster and the disc stars ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",

    "warping , rather than thickening , occurs in this case for two main reasons :    \\(i ) vector resonant relaxation arises through the torque from a stellar orbit after averaging over mean anomaly and argument of pericentre , and this averaged torque has much less small - scale power than the forces exerted in the passage of a nearby star ( cf .",

    "more quantitatively , consider two nearby stars on circular orbits with semi - major axes @xmath37 and @xmath473 , and relative inclination @xmath474 ; torques from stars at larger relative inclinations are smaller and can be neglected for this argument .",

    "a rough measure of the validity of this approximation is given by figure [ fig : warpone ] , which shows the evolution of the orientations of the stars in a disc of zero mass : since the disc self - gravity has been turned off in this figure , the stars behave in the same manner as random stars in the spherical cluster , so the approximation that the perturbing forces from the cluster are constant is valid if the inclinations of the stars in this figure are small .",
    "evidently the approximation of constant forces is good for the outer parts of the cluster , where the relaxation time is relatively long , and suspect in the inner parts .    both of our major approximations  laplace ",
