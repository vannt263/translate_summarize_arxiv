    "artificial antiferromagnets , formed of nanostructured superlattices that are coupled antiferromagnetically , have been the focus of many recent studies , due to their high potential for innovative technological applications .",
    "these possible applications range from high - density recording technology @xcite to spintronics devices @xcite and magnetic refrigeration.@xcite artificial antiferromagnets are heterostructures composed of ferromagnetic layers that are coupled antiferromagnetically via spacers .",
    "this structure yields a high level of control over both the intra- and interlayer interactions , allowing for a tailoring of the physical properties .",
    "examples include [ co / pt]/ru , where ferromagnetic co / pt multilayers are periodically separated by ru layers,@xcite or co / cr , where thin co films are separated by the spacer cr.@xcite the magnetic moments of the ferromagnetic layers can thereby either be perpendicular ( as it is the case for co / pt with perpendicular anisotropy ) or parallel ( as encountered in co films ) to the interface separating the ferromagnetic layers from the spacers .",
    "[ co / pt]/ru with strong perpendicular anisotropy , as well as the related systems like [ co / pt]/nio , co / ir , and fe / au , have been called synthetic metamagnets,@xcite as they can exhibit a regime with an antiferromagnetic phase at low external magnetic fields and a paramagnetic phase at large fields .",
    "when changing the value of the magnetic field , plateaux show up in the magnetic hysteresis of these films , due to the fact that different layers reverse their magnetization at different values of the field.@xcite in fact , for an even number of identical ferromagnetic layers in a thin film exactly two metamagnetic transitions are observed , as one of the outermost layers switches at a lower field than the internal layers.@xcite the same sequence of phases should also be realized for in - plane magnetization and strong anisotropy.@xcite    in a phenomenological approach it is customary to replace in systems with strong perpendicular anisotropy the ferromagnetic multilayers by a single ferromagnetic layer.@xcite this naturally leads to a modeling of synthetic metamagnets by an ising metamagnet , i.e. a layered ising model with ferromagnetic in - layer interactions and antiferromagetic interactions between adjacent layers .",
    "the advantage of using a layered ising model is that this type of model is perfectly suited for a study of thermal properties through standard numerical methods .",
    "however , modeling ferromagnetic multilayers by single ferromagnetic layers also has its restrictions as it does not allow a theoretical description of the multidomain states , composed of metamagnetic stripe and bubble domains , that may form when applying a magnetic field to an artificial antiferromagnet with strong anisotropy.@xcite    over the years ising metamagnets have attracted quite some attention on their own.@xcite indeed , due to their simplicity , ising metamagnets are ideal systems to study the properties of a tricritical point that separates a discontinuous transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases at high fields and low temperatures from a continuous transition between the same phases at low fields and high temperatures .",
    "in addition , the mean - field prediction of a decomposition of the tricritical point into a critical end point and a double critical end point @xcite has led to systematic numerical investigations of this possible scenario . whereas many studies have concluded that this decomposition does not take place in short - range models,@xcite the increase of the interlayer coordination , which brings the model closer to be of mean - field type , yields anomalies in the specific heat and the magnetization @xcite that resemble those measured in febr@xmath0.@xcite    the general behavior of ising metamagnets is by now well understood .",
    "however , all mentioned studies focused on bulk systems and no systematic studies of metamagnetic properties of thin ising films have been done .",
    "the recent interest in synthetic metamagnets warrants an in - depth understanding of metamagnets in confined geometries , and we propose here a step in that direction by studying thin ising metamagnetic films .",
    "an additional motivation for our work comes from the recent analysis @xcite of non - equilibrium relaxation processes in co / cr superlattices .",
    "this study revealed that intriguing aging phenomena take place in layered antiferromagnets . in order to better understand these observations",
    "a thorough study of the dynamical properties of related theoretical models is needed . however , before being able to study in depth the non - equilibrium properties of metamagnetic films , we found it necessary to first fully understand the equilibrium properties of these systems",
    ". therefore we focus in this paper on the equilibrium phase diagram of thin metamagnetic films .",
    "the non - equilibrium properties of these systems will be discussed in a separate publication .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . after having introduced our model in section ii",
    ", we discuss in section iii its equilibrium properties . using the wang - landau scheme ,",
    "we determine the density of states ( degeneracy ) of our classical model and discuss its prominent features .",
    "this density of states is then used for a canonical analysis of the system where the focus is on the two phase transitions that are observed in thin film geometry when increasing the external magnetic field . as the wang - landau scheme",
    "is restricted to small systems , we supplement our study by standard monte carlo simulations of larger systems . from these numerical data",
    "we derive the phase diagram of thin metamagnetic films and show that in thin films a new phase transition line shows up that separates two ordered phases .",
    "this transition , which is absent in bulk systems , is found to be discontinuous and to end in a critical end point . finally , in section iv we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "we consider a layered lattice model on a cubic lattice where every lattice point @xmath1 is characterized by an ising spin , @xmath2 .",
    "the interactions between nearest neighbor spins are ferromagnetic in the planes perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis .",
    "these two - dimensional planes are coupled antiferromagnetically in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "adding an external magnetic field of strength @xmath4 , the hamiltonian of our system is then given by @xmath5 where we have introduced the internal energy @xmath6 and the magnetization @xmath7 .",
    "the sums over @xmath8 resp .",
    "@xmath9 are sums over nearest neighbor pairs in the plane resp . along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the intralayer and interlayer coupling strengths are given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast to previous studies we focus on thin films which are realized by imposing free boundary conditions in the @xmath3 direction , whereas in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions we have periodic boundary conditions . in accordance with the synthetic metamagnets we consider rather few layers , typically @xmath14 or @xmath15 ( we restrict ourselves to even numbers of layers ) . for the case of periodic boundary conditions in all three directions , which has been studied extensively in the past , the system undergoes a metamagnetic transition between an antiferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase when increasing the field strength .",
    "this transition is discontinuous for high fields and low temperatures and continuous for low fields and high temperatures .",
    "it is expected that an additional transition shows up when considering films , this transition being characterized by the alignment of the magnetization of one of the outermost planes with the external field.@xcite    we study this system using different simulation techniques . in order to elucidate its static properties we compute the degeneracy ( or density of states ) @xmath16 as a function of internal energy @xmath17 and magnetization @xmath18 using the wang - landau scheme.@xcite the degeneracy can then be used for a standard canonical analysis , with the partition sum as a function of temperature @xmath19 and magnetic field @xmath4 being given by ( we choose units for which @xmath20 ) @xmath21 all global quantities of interest ( like the mean magnetization , the mean energy , the susceptibility , and the specific heat ) then follow from derivatives of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that the wang - landau scheme usually yields a very good estimate for the degeneracy , allowing for a detailed canonical analysis .",
    "however , only rather small systems can be studied in this way .",
    "we therefore supplement our study with traditional importance sampling simulations of larger system sizes , using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we thereby study thin films with layers that contain @xmath23 spins , with @xmath14 , 16 , 32 , and 64 .",
    "relevant quantities are computed for a large number of temperatures and field strengths ; in order to completely cover the phase diagram , the increment between successive @xmath19 and @xmath4 values is typically 0.01 .",
    "we focus in the following on the thermal equilibrium properties of thin ising ferromagnets .",
    "the statistical physics treatment of our classical spin models allows for an in - depth discussion of its properties as a function of all relevant parameters , which in our case are the temperature and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "as already mentioned we compute for our smaller systems the density of states @xmath16 , i.e. the number of microscopic configurations that have the same internal energy @xmath17 and the same magnetization @xmath18 . having this two - dimensional histogram at our disposal",
    ", we can then compute all relevant global thermodynamic quantities from the partition sum ( [ eq : z ] ) and its derivatives by simply inserting the numerical values for @xmath19 and @xmath4 .    before doing that we briefly discuss the density of states itself .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the microcanonical entropy @xmath24 as a function of the energy density @xmath25 and the magnetization density @xmath26 ( here @xmath27 is the total number of spins in our systems ) for three different cases .",
    "whereas in ( a ) we consider a system with periodic boundary conditions composed of @xmath28 spins , with @xmath29 , in ( b ) and ( c ) we show two systems of @xmath28 sites with free boundary condition in @xmath3 direction , the different systems having different relative strengths of the interactions : @xmath29 in ( b ) and @xmath30 in ( c ) .     as a function of energy density @xmath25 and magnetization density @xmath26 for systems containing @xmath28 spins .",
    "( a ) periodic boundary conditions in all three directions and @xmath29 , ( b ) free surfaces in @xmath3 direction with @xmath29 , and ( c ) free surfaces in @xmath3 direction with @xmath30 .",

    "the supports of the entropy surfaces are indicated by the larger points . , width=604 ]    in a microcanonical analysis one infers the physical property of a system from a direct study of the microcanonical entropy @xmath31 . @xcite",
    "most investigations of this type focused on spin models with ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions , as for example the standard ising or potts models,@xcite or on polymer models.@xcite due to its complicated interactions , the microcanonical entropy of the ising metamagnet is more complex as , for example , that of the standard nearest neighbor ising model,@xcite see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . still some of its features and properties are readily understood .",
    "firstly , there are obvious properties that are independent of the boundary conditions and of the interaction ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the ground state is two - fold degenerate and has magnetization zero ( recall that we only study systems with even numbers of layers ) , with the fully ordered layers pointing alternatively in up or down direction .",
    "obviously , a given ground state can be changed into the other ground state by multiplying all the spins by @xmath33 .",
    "this symmetry of the internal energy also shows up in the symmetry of the entropy surfaces with respect to the @xmath34 line .",
    "interestingly , the entropy surfaces all display prominent kinks at magnetizations @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , corresponding to configurations with fully ordered planes where @xmath37 planes have been flipped with respect to the ground state .",
    "changing the interaction ratio @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b and [ fig1]c , mainly changes the range of accessible energies . as a result ,",
    "smaller values of @xmath32 yield a compressed , but otherwise unchanged , entropy surface .    at a first look ,",
    "changing the boundary condition in @xmath3 direction also seems to only have minor effects on @xmath38 . however , one notes that the energy difference between the ground state and the state with one flipped layer , with @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is smaller for the free boundaries in @xmath3 direction than for the periodic boundaries , compare fig .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ fig1]b .",
    "as we already argued in the introduction ( and as we will see later in the canonical analysis ) , our metamagnetic films should display two metamagnetic transitions , a first transition at low magnetic fields , where only one surface layer is flipped , and a second transition at higher fields where the remaining layers pointing opposite to the magnetic field are flipped .",
    "in contrast , a system with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions is known to undergo a single metamagnetic transition.@xcite with this in mind , it seems surprising that very similarly looking entropy surfaces should yield these different phase transition sequences .",
    "in fact , it is the decrease of the energy difference between the ground state and the states with fully ordered planes and magnetization @xmath40 that ultimately is responsible for the emergence of this additional transition .",
    "we show that in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we plot for systems with @xmath41 the quantity @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and different values of @xmath4 . in the canonical ensemble",
    "the corresponding quantity is of course the helmholtz free energy density which is minimal for the stable state .",

    "[ fig2]a , our quantity is minimal for @xmath34 and low fields . when the field strength exceeds @xmath45 , a metamagnetic phase transition takes place such that the stable phase is now the paramagnetic phase with @xmath46 .",

    "the canonical correspondence of this quantity is the helmholtz free energy density .",
    "the global minimum of the plotted quantity allows to understand the sequence of phases that show up when changing the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the systems contain @xmath28 spins , with ( a ) periodic boundary conditions and ( b ) free boundary conditions in @xmath3 direction .",
    "the insets show the relevant parts of the microcanonical entropy , see main text .",
    ", width=537 ]      even so the microcanonical analysis allows to determine the sequence of phases , an in - depth study of the thermal properties of the metamagnetic films warrants a canonical analysis of the standard quantities as a function of temperature and magnetic field . in the following ,",
    "we discuss small systems for which the density of states can be obtained numerically , as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "this density of states @xmath50 is then used for the computation of the partition sum and related quantities .",
    "thus for a quantity @xmath51 the thermal average at temperature @xmath19 and field strength @xmath4 is @xmath52 where the partition function @xmath53 is given by eq .",

    "we supplement this canonical analysis of small systems based on the density of states by standard canonical simulations of larger systems , with the same number of layers but different number of spins in the layers .",
    "this allows us to assess the finite - size effects and to extrapolate to films with a large number of spins in every layer .",
    "standard importance sampling monte carlo simulations often yield results of lesser quality than the canonical analysis based on the wang / landau scheme . on the other hand larger systems can easily be simulated .",

    "this excludes the existence of a line of continuous phase transitions at high temperatures and low fields , indicating that the line of discontinuous transitions ends in a critical end point .",
    "therefore , instead of crossing a phase transition line , with its characteristic singularities , one can go from the antiferromagnetic phase at low temperatures and fields to the intermediate phase with one flipped layer in a smooth and gradual way .",
    "this is in complete analogy to the well known behavior of water where one can go in a similar way from vapor to liquid without a phase transition .",
    "based on our data we locate this critical end point at @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "the intermediate phase is replaced by the paramagnetic phase where all layers are parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this intermediate phase is absent in the corresponding bulk system and is therefore characteristic for thin metamagnetic films .    using the wang - landau algorithm and importance sampling monte carlo simulations we thoroughly studied the equilibrium properties of our system .",
    "the wang - landau method yields the microcanonical entropy ( or , alternatively , the degeneracy ) as a function of magnetization and internal energy .",
    "the microcanonical entropy surface is rather complicated and reveals interesting features that we discussed in some detail .",
    "thus we were able to relate the appearance of the intermediate phase to a subtle change in the microcanonical entropy when changing the boundary condition .    our canonical analysis of different thermal quantities , as for example the global and layer magnetization , the global and layer susceptibility as well as the global and layer specific heat , allows us to determine the temperature @xmath92 magnetic field phase diagram shown in fig .",
