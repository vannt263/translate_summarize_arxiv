    ", the fine - structure lines do not suffer as much from dust extinction , and the low energies of the fine - structure levels ( @xmath7k ) , make the fine - structure lines relatively insensitive to the nebular electron temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath9k in h  ii regions ) .",
    "fine - structure line emissions from photoionized gas have been observed in a wide range of astrophysical sources ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; cox et al . 1999 ; thornley et al .",
    "their measured intensities have been shown to be strong , comparable to optical hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "the relative strengths of the fine - structure emission lines may be used to probe the ionizing spectral energy distributions ( seds ) because different ionization stages are formed by significantly different photon energy ranges in the ionizing spectrum .",
    "for example , the [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  line ratio is sensitive to photons emitted at @xmath10 rydberg region , while [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m   probes the region @xmath11 rydberg . measuring these ( and other ) ratios can constrain the seds of the hot stars in h  ii regions ( thornley et al .",

    "2001a ) or of the non - stellar sources in active galactic nuclei ( alexander et al . 1999 ; 2000 ) .",
    "the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on board _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) made spectroscopic studies of galactic and extragalactic sources possible across the entire mid - infrared ( 2.545@xmath0 m ) spectral range ( de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ; kessler et al . 1996",
    "; genzel & cesarsky 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we have compiled sws observations of fine - structure emission lines from galactic and nearby extra - galactic h  ii regions from the iso data archive .",
    "the sources were selected as those in which the [ ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  or [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0 m  lines are present , and eliminating target types other than h  ii regions . since these objects are typically prominent sources of the diagnostically useful [ ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m , [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0 m , [ s  iii]18.7@xmath0 m , [ s  iii]33.5@xmath0 m , and [ s  iv]10.5@xmath0mfine - structure lines and the br@xmath1  and br@xmath2  recombination lines , we extracted these lines as well for sources in which they were observed .",
    "in this paper we have several goals .",
    "first , we wish to re - investigate the large scale variations in elemental abundances and nebular excitation across the galactic disk .",
    "the galactic sources in our sample have a wide enough range in galactocentric distance ( 0  kpc  @xmath12  kpc ) to enable us to study these variations .",
    "such studies using iso data have been presented by cox et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a sample of 46 galactic h  ii regions over a range of 0 kpc to 25 kpc in galactocentric radius , and showed that the excitation ratios [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  and [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m  increase as a function of the galactocentric radius .",
    "they also showed that the argon and neon abundances , based on observations of [ ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  and [ ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m decrease by a factor of 2 from the inner galaxy outwards ( see also roelfsema et al . 1999 and martn - hernndez 2000 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the trends found in earlier studies of galactic h  ii regions using ground - based and air - borne observations ( simpson , colgan , & rubin 1995 ; afflerbach , churchwell , & werner 1997 ) . here",
    "we present results for a larger source sample . understanding",
    "the excitation gradient within our galaxy may shed further light on excitation variations observed in external galaxies ( e.g. shields & tinsley 1976 in m101 ; henry & howard 1995 in m33 , m81 and m101 ; see also shields 1990 ) .",
    "second , we use the observations as templates for constraining the results of new generation wind- driven ( nlte ) stellar atmosphere computations ( pauldrach , hoffmann , & lennon 2001 ) .",
    "for example , a long - standing problem in galactic h  ii regions studies has been the failure of photoionization simulations employing old - generation static ( lte ) atmospheres ( kurucz 1992 ) to reproduce the observed ( high - excitation ) [ ne  iii ] line emission ( baldwin et al .",
    "1991 ; simpson et al .",
    "we re - investigate ( and resolve ) this issue here using nlte atmospheres . in our analysis",
    "we construct an [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m  _ vs. _ [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  diagnostic diagram as a measure of the nebular excitation .",
    "we fit the observed correlation between these two line ratios by constructing nebular simulations in which the photoionizing stellar seds are modeled using nlte atmosphere computations .",
    "we compare with results obtained using the older lte kurucz atmospheres .",
    "we also explore the effects of metallicity variations by self - consistently varying the nebular and the stellar atmosphere abundances .",
    "this paper is a part of a larger framework , whose aims are to study theoretical models of starburst regions , as they are probed by ir spectroscopy ( kunze et al . 1996 ; lutz et al .",
    "1996 ; rigopoulou et al . 1996",
    "; sturm et al . 1997 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; thornley et al . 2000 , frester schreiber et al .",
    "2001a , b ) . for example , thornley et al . ( 2000 ) measured the [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  excitation ratio in extra - galactic starburst sources , and found it to be _ low _ compared to starburst models which incorporate the new - generation atmospheres .",
    "they concluded that this is evidence for global aging of the star - forming regions .",
    "fine - structure emission lines have also been used to try and determine the primary energy source in the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; lutz et al .",
    "1996 ; genzel et al . 1998 ; rigopoulou et al . 1999 ) .",
    "understanding the properties of the seds of hot stars , as probed by galactic h  ii regions , is crucial to the interpretation of the extra - galactic observations .",
    "the iso data archive contains several thousands of observations that were obtained with the 2.445@xmath0 m grating spectrometer sws .",
    "we have identified potential h  ii regions in all observations taken in the full spectrum mode ( sws01 ) and the line spectroscopy mode ( sws02 ) during the iso mission .",
    "an automatic procedure starting from the off - line processing version 7 standard processed data ( spd ) processed all these observations to the auto analysis result ( aar ) level . from every aar , a spectral range of @xmath1330 resolution elements ( r=2000 ) around the [ ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  and [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0 m  lines , was cut out for further analysis .",
    "this processing was automated by a script which flat - fielded the individual detectors to their mean value , removed 3@xmath14 outliers and rebinned each line to a single - valued spectrum .    for the sws01 data , a simple automatic removal of the sws band-3 instrumental fringes , was applied in this procedure when the continuum for the [ ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  and [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0 m  lines exceeded 100 jy .",
    "we then automatically fitted gaussians to the rebinned spectral segments and measured line fluxes .",
    "a source was considered a candidate for in - depth processing if at least one of the two lines was apparently present at a level above @xmath15 w@xmath16 .    for the sws02 data , the automatically produced single valued spectral segments for each line",
    "were stored and later inspected visually for the presence of lines , which finally gave a list of observation number and target name for every clear detection of either [ ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m or [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0 m or both .",
    "visual inspection was preferred here , since the defringing step in aot02 observations is less robust , and a lot of faulty detections would occur otherwise .",
    "our selection procedure initially gave also objects of similar spectral characteristics ( nearby galaxies , planetary nebulae etc . ) which were subsequently identified and excluded from further processing .",
    "all observations from the list of candidate h  ii regions were then reprocessed and the line fluxes were measured . in table  [ linelist ] we list the the specific emission lines included in our source sample , together with their ionization potentials , line wavelengths , and critical densities for electron impact collisions .    for the sws01 data , this needed special care since a large fraction of the observations was taken in the faster speed options of the sws01 mode . for those observations ,",
    "the grating moved during integrations causing curved integration ramps when passing a strong emission line .",
    "the automatic deglitching of the sws data occasionally confused such curved ramps with jumps in the ramps that correspond to glitches caused by ionizing particle hits , and thus might have affected emission line fluxes ( section 4.5 of iso handbook volume 6 , the short wavelength spectrometer , sai-2000 - 008/dc , version 1.1 . , http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/manuals/handbook/vi/sws_hb/ ) .",
    "all sws01 data except for the slowest speed 4 were hence reprocessed twice from erd level , once with standard olp version 8 calibration files and once with one calibration file changed to switch off the glitch recognition . in both cases ,",
    "the data were processed to the aar level , cleaned from outliers by iterative clipping , flat - fielded , and rebinned to a single - valued spectrum .",
    "the two versions were then plotted and inspected to determine whether the deglitching might have affected the real line in the standard processing , or whether a glitch might have been present in those data with glitch recognition switched off .",
    "this classification was in most cases possible on the basis of feature shape and widths .",
    "the line flux or limit was then measured in that version not affected by problems . in a few cases with both versions affected ,",
    "generous upper limits were adopted .",
    "sws01 speed 4 and sws02 data were processed by default before measuring line fluxes by direct integration of the continuum subtracted line , or determining upper limits corresponding to a line , of 3@xmath14 peak height and the proper width . for sws01 observations",
    "this was done for all lines in table  [ linelist ] , for sws02 only for those present in a particular observation . the uncertainty in the line fluxes is estimated to be @xmath17 .",
    "the final identification of individual objects  whether it is an h  ii region or a different kind of source ( e.g. nearby galaxy , planetary nebula etc . ) that was missed by the first filtering , or whether there were multiple observations of the same object  is based on a literature survey , mainly using the simbad astronomical database .",
    "a total of 149 sws spectra were selected for the final sample .",
    "this includes almost all of the h  ii regions observed by iso - sws - 112 galactic h  ii regions , spanning galactocentric radii of 0 to @xmath1818 kpc , 14 h  ii regions in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , 4 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , and 19 in the nearby spiral galaxy m33 .",
    "this sample is certainly heterogeneous since it is a collection of targets observed for different proposals and scientific reasons .",
    "these include detailed studies of well known individual h  ii regions , more systematic surveys of compact h  ii regions originally selected on the basis of iras - lrs spectra and on the basis of iras sources located outside the solar circle , observations of the brightest h  ii regions in the lmc , smc , and m33 , and h  ii region observations targeted at specific issues of ism physics rather than a per se characterization of the h  ii region observed .",
    "the selection criteria adopted by these proposals necessarily differed , and incomplete execution of planned observations during the iso mission induces another ( though uncritical ) selection effect .",
    "some observations represent integrated fluxes of rather compact well - defined h  ii regions , others different parts of more complex regions , including pointings in the outskirts of resolved nebulae . however , the sample spans h  ii regions with a wide enough range of positions and excitation conditions to study both the stellar seds and galactic metallicity and nebular excitation gradients .",
    "metallicity gradient analyses in our galaxy should be little affected by possible selection biases in our sample , as long as there is efficient mixing at a given galactocentric radius .",
    "the situation is less clear for excitation analyses where competing selection biases are possible .",
    "selection on compactness , for example , might prefer younger ( harder ) but also less luminous ( softer ) objects , with additional effects due to dust possible .",
    "similarly , optical rather than infrared / radio selection might prefer more evolved ( softer ) but also more luminous ( harder ) and lower metallicity ( harder ) objects , all perhaps more likely to be optically visible .",
    "since a large fraction of the targets in the iso database is originally iras - selected , such effects are likely not governing excitation analyses as a function of galactocentric radius in our sample .",
    "we obtained radial velocity measurements for most of the galactic sources from the literature ( see references in tables  2 and [ data_ref ] ) .",
    "these velocities were determined using different methods and are based on various emission features ( e.g. , radio recombination lines ; sub - mm molecular lines of co , cs , and ci ; maser emission ) . in some cases ( dr21 , gal 007.47 + 00.06 ) , the given velocity value is the mean between different values obtained from the same method ( i.e. , several recombination lines ) .",
    "we use the rohlfs & kreitschmann ( 1987 ) galactic rotation curve to calculate the galactocentric distance of each source .",
    "their rotation curve spans a range of 0.1 to 19.4 kpc in galactocentric radius . for the sun",
    "we adopt a galactocentric distance @xmath19 kpc and rotational velocity @xmath20 km s@xmath21 ( honma & sofue 1997 ) .",
    "we have transformed the rotation curve of rohlfs & kreitschmann ( @xmath22 kpc and @xmath23 km s@xmath21 ) using the more updated solar values of honma & sofue .",
    "most of the galactic sources lie very near the galactic plane ( typically , @xmath24 ) , so we assume that they lie in the galactic plane ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "( an exception is the orion nebula ( @xmath26 ) , for which the following procedure was not applied . ) for each source having a radial velocity @xmath27 and a galactic longitude @xmath28 , we compute the quantity @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . \\label{rot_curve_eq}\\ ] ] here , @xmath32 is the galactocentric radius and @xmath33 is the rotational velocity at @xmath32 . using a linear interpolation of the @xmath29 curve from honma & sofue we find the values of @xmath32 corresponding to the @xmath29 of each source .",
    "the kinematic distance ( @xmath34 ; distance from the sun ) is calculated by inverting the formula @xmath35 for sources outside the solar circle , this gives a single solution , whereas inside the solar circle , one obtains two solutions .",
    "the choice of distance in this case is based on different methods discussed in the references .",
    "a distance ambiguity remains for only three sources designated with asterisks in table 2 ( column 8) .",

    "the iso fine - structure data thus provide direct empirical evidence for the improved accuracy of the nlte atmosphere seds in the lyman continuum range .",
    "the nlte sequence also indicates that for most of the displayed h  ii regions the effective temperatures of the exciting stars plausibly lie in the range of 35,000 to 45,000 k.    we have examined the dependence of the model results on the ionization parameter by considering variations in both @xmath121 and @xmath64 ( see eq .",

    "we will explore the effects of realistic clusters containing a synthesized distribution of stars and associated cluster seds in a later paper .",
    "variations in the assumed density ( in the range of 10@xmath122 to @xmath96 @xmath54 ) induce only small shifts in the positions of the computed model sequences .    in figure  [ ar_ne_den ]",
    "we show the nlte dwarfs and lte model sequences for nebular densities of 100 , 800 , and @xmath96 @xmath54 .",
    "we conclude that the lte sequence can not be reconciled with the data by varying either @xmath121 or @xmath64 .    in order to investigate the influence of varying the metallicity we show in figure  [ ar_ne_metal ] results for three sequences of nlte atmosphere models of dwarfs  computed assuming half - solar , solar , and twice - solar metallicities .",
    "we varied the metallicity self - consistently in the nebulae and in the stellar atmospheres .",
    "both of these variations affects the computed line ratios .",
    "lower nebular metallicity results in higher gas temperatures , reduced recombination rates , and therefore slightly higher excitation .",
    "afflerbach et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a similar trend in their study , but they also stressed the need for exploring the effects of metallicity variations in the stellar atmospheres as well .",
    "we have done this here , and find that such variations have a somewhat larger effect on the computed line ratios . for a given effective temperature",
    "the sed hardens with decreasing metallicity , due to decreased line blocking in the stellar atmosphere winds .",
    "this effect is primarily significant above @xmath123 ryd . at these energies",
    "the blocking is dominated by many fe  iv , fe  v and fe  vi lines , which are mainly optically thick near the wind sonic point and optically thin in the outer wind region .",
    "as the metallicity is increased , the fe lines remain optically thick to higher velocities , thus enhancing the blocking influence in this frequency regime .",
    "however , below @xmath123 ryd the blocking is dominated by c , n , o , ne , and ar . the corresponding lines are mainly optically thick in the entire wind region .",
    "changes in metallicity therefore do not significantly affect the emergent ( blocked ) fluxes below 2.5 ryd .",
    "therefore , varying the metallicity has a larger effect on the [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratio than on the [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m  ratio as indicated in figure  [ ar_ne_metal ] .",
    "for example , for a 40,000 k star increasing the nebular and stellar metallicty from 0.5 to 2 @xmath124 reduces the [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m  ratio by a factor of @xmath125 and the [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratio by a factor of @xmath126 .",
    "figure  [ ar_ne_metal ] also demonstrates that the excitation in the lmc nebulae ( indicated by star symbols ) is plausibly enhanced , at least in part , by the reduced metallicity of the lmc .",
    "however , the low - excitation of the inner galaxy sources ( indicated by the crosses ) is probably _ not _ due to their large metallicities , since these objects appear to have relatively large [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratios for their [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m  ratios , whereas increasing the metallicity should selectively _ reduce _ the [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratio .",
    "the low excitation of the inner galaxy sources is most likely due to lower effective temperatures of the stellar ( or cluster ) sources . in this respect",
    "these objects may resemble the typical low - excitation sources observed in the starburst sample of thornley et al .",
    "we have not attempted detailed modeling of individual sources in this paper . however , as we have shown , the ensemble of galactic fine - structure emission line data provide empirical support for the generally harder photoionizing seds predicted in nlte wind driven line blocked models of hot - star atmospheres . in particular , such models can readily account for the presence of high excitation [ ne  iii ] emission lines in nebular spectra .",
    "earlier studies which had relied on lte atmospheres in the nebular analysis were unable to account for the observed [ ne  iii ] emission , and under - predicted the line intensities by factors of @xmath116 ( e.g. baldwin et al .",
    "1991 ; rubin et al . 1995 ; simpson et al .",
    "our study largely resolves this issue and supports the suggestions of sellmaier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and stasinska & schaerer ( 1997 ) that this `` ne  iii problem '' was due primarily to a significant under - prediction of lyc photons above @xmath127 ev in the kurucz lte atmospheres .",
    "this conclusion has important consequences for the interpretation of extragalactic fine - structure line observations .",
    "thornley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) carried out detailed starburst modeling of the [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratio expected from h  ii regions ionized by clusters of stars in which the stellar seds were modeled using the new generation nlte atmospheres .",
    "given that the hottest stars in such models easily produce large nebular [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratios , the low ratios actually observed led to the conclusion that the relative number of hot stars is small due to aging of the starburst systems .",
    "our analysis supports the conclusion that low [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratios require the removal of the hottest stars as dominant contributors to the ionization of the starburst galaxies .",
    "we summarize our key results .",
    "we have compiled archival mid - ir iso - sws fine - structure lines and h  ii recombination line observations from h  ii regions in the galaxy , the lmc , smc , and m33 .",
    "we find that :    * there is a steep outward increase in excitation in the galaxy as probed by the fine - structure line ratios [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m , [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m , and [ s  iii]18.7@xmath0m/[s  iii]33.5@xmath0 m .",
    "sources in the central kpc of the galaxy show the lowest levels of excitation , and the lmc , and smc sources show the highest excitation level .",
    "* there is a slight decrease in metallicity from @xmath4 in the galactic center to @xmath5 in the outer disk . *",
    "the increase in nebular excitation across the galactic disk is likely due mainly to a rise in the typical effective temperatures of the exciting stars rather than a hardening of the stellar seds and enhanced nebular excitation associated with the decline in metallicity at fixed effective temperature .",
    "* by comparing models to observations , we find that the nlte wind model atmospheres represent an impressive improvement in the realistic description of hot star ionizing spectra ( compared to lte static models ) .",

    "<S> we present mid - infrared iso - sws observations of the fine - structure emissions lines [ ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m , [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0 m , [ ne  iii]36.0@xmath0 m , [ ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m , [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0 m , [ s  iii]18.7@xmath0 m , [ s  iii]33.5@xmath0 m , [ s  iv]10.5@xmath0 m and the recombination lines br@xmath1  and br@xmath2 , in a sample of 112 galactic h  ii regions and 37 nearby extra - galactic h  ii regions in the lmc , smc , and m33 . </S>",
    "<S> we selected our sources from archival iso - sws data as those showing prominent [ ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  or [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0 m  emissions . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic sources have a wide range in galactocentric distance ( 0 kpc @xmath3 kpc ) , which enables us to study excitation and metallicity variations over large galactic scales . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a steep rise in the [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m , [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m , and [ s  iv]10.5@xmath0m/[s  iii]33.5@xmath0 m  excitation ratios from the inner galaxy outwards , and a moderate decrease in metallicity , from @xmath4 in the inner galaxy to @xmath5 in the outer disk . </S>",
    "<S> the extra - galactic sources in our sample show low gas density , low metallicity and high excitation . we find a good correlation between [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  and [ ar  iii]8.99@xmath0m/[ar  ii]6.99@xmath0 m  excitation ratios in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the observed correlation is well - reproduced by theoretical nebular models which incorporate new generation wind - driven nlte model stellar atmospheres for the photoionizing stars . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the nlte atmospheres can account for the production of [ ne  iii ] emission in the h  ii regions . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed self - consistent nebular and stellar atmosphere models for a range of metallicities ( 0.5 to 2 @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the increase in nebular excitation with galactocentric radius is due to an increase in stellar effective temperature ( as opposed to a hardening of the stellar seds due to the metallicity gradient ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate an integrated [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratio for the galaxy of 0.8 , which puts it well inside the range of values for starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the good fit between observations and our models support the conclusion of thornley et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2000 ) , that the low [ ne  iii]15.6@xmath0m/[ne  ii]12.8@xmath0 m  ratios observed in extra - galactic sources are due to global aging effects . </S>"
