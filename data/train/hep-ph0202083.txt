    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the sine and cosine of the electroweak mixing angle @xmath18 . in cp ",
    "noninvariant theories , the mass parameters are complex . without loss of generality @xmath1 can be taken real and positive so that the two remaining non  trivial phases may be attributed to @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "neutralinos are produced in @xmath19 collisions , either in diagonal or in mixed pairs : @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "if the collider energy is sufficient to produce the four neutralino states in pairs , the underlying fundamental susy parameters @xmath22 can be extracted from the masses @xmath23 ( @xmath11=1,2,3,4 ) and couplings .",
    "partial information from the lowest @xmath23 ( @xmath11=1,2 ) neutralino states is sufficient to extract @xmath24 if the other parameters have been pre  determined in the chargino sector @xcite .",
    "in the mssm , the four neutralinos @xmath25 are mixtures of the neutral u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauginos and the su(2 ) higgsinos . since the matrix @xmath26 is symmetric , one unitary matrix @xmath27 is sufficient to rotate the gauge eigenstate basis @xmath28 to the mass eigenstate basis of the majorana fields @xmath29 : @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the mass eigenvalues @xmath32 in @xmath33 can be chosen positive by a suitable definition of the unitary matrix @xmath27 , which can be parametrized by 6 angles and 10 phases .",
    "it is convenient to factorize the matrix @xmath27 into a diagonal majorana @xmath34 and a dirac ",
    "type @xmath35 component in the following way : @xmath36 one overall majorana phase is unphysical and may be chosen to vanish and the matrix @xmath35 can be written as a sequence of 6 two - dimensional rotations .",
    "complete analytical results are given in @xcite .",
    "the unitarity constraints on the elements of the mixing matrix @xmath27 can be formulated by means of unitarity quadrangles which are built up by the links @xmath37 connecting two rows @xmath11 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 and by the links @xmath40 connecting two columns @xmath11 and @xmath38 @xmath41 of the mixing matrix .",
    "the areas of the six quadrangles @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by @xmath44=\\frac{1}{4 }           ( |j_{ij}^{12}|+|j_{ij}^{23}|+|j_{ij}^{34}|+|j_{ij}^{41}| ) , \\quad { \\rm area}[d_{ij}]=\\frac{1}{4 }           ( |j_{12}^{ij}|+|j_{23}^{ij}|+|j_{34}^{ij}|+|j_{41}^{ij}| ) , \\label{eq : ad}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 are the jarlskog  type cp  odd `` plaquettes '' : @xmath46 . the matrix @xmath27 is cp violating , if either any one of the plaquettes is non  zero , or , if the plaquettes all vanish , at least one of the links is non  parallel to the real or to the imaginary axis .",
    "the phases of the neutralino fields are fixed ( modulo a common phase ) and the orientation of the neutralino quadrangles @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the complex plane is physically non  trivial . since the neutralino mass matrix involves only two invariant phases @xmath47 and @xmath48 , all the physical phases of @xmath27 are fully determined by these two phases in the mass matrix .",
    "therefore the experimental reconstruction of the unitarity quadrangles overconstrains the neutralino system and numerous consistency relations can be exploited to scrutinize the validity of the underlying theory @xcite .",
    "in cp  invariant theories the s - wave excitation giving rise to a steep rise @xmath49 of the cross section for the nondiagonal pair near threshold signals opposite cp parities of produced neutralinos .",
    "not all nondiagonal pairs of neutralinos can be produced in the s  wave ; if @xmath50 and @xmath51 have opposite cp parities , the pair @xmath52 has the same and it will be excited in the p - wave characterized by the slow rise @xmath53 of the cross section .",
    "it is important to realize that cp - violation may change the threshold behaviour , cf .",
    "fig.[fig : th]a , and in particular may allow s - wave excitations in any nondiagonal pair , e.g. finding the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 pairs to be excited in the s  wave would uniquely signal cp violation .",
    "the measurements of the chargino  pair production processes @xmath54 ( @xmath55=1,2 ) carried out with polarized beams can be used for a complete determination of the basic susy parameters @xmath56 in the chargino sector with high precision @xcite .",
    "each of the four characteristic equations for the neutralino mass squared can be cast into the form @xcite @xmath57 the coefficients @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are functions of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 pre  determined in the chargino sector , and the mass @xmath63 ; the coefficient @xmath59 is necessarily proportional to @xmath64 because physical masses are cp  even .",
    "each neutralino mass defines a circle in the @xmath65 plane .",
    "thus the measurement of three neutralino masses leads to an unambiguous determination @xmath4 , cf .",
    "[ fig : contour]a . with only two light neutralino masses , the two  fold ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting the measured cross section @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour]b",
    ". however , if the phase @xmath64 vanishes , there remains a two  fold discrete sign ambiguity @xcite .",
    "if all four masses are experimentally accessible the complete reconstruction of the mass and mixing parameters is easy .",
    "the four  state mixing of neutralinos in the mssm is reflected in the sum rules for the neutralino couplings @xcite . therefore evaluating these sum rules experimentally",
    ", it can be tested whether the four  neutralino system @xmath67 forms a closed system , or whether additional states at high mass scales mix in , signaling the existence of an extended gaugino system .",
    "a linear collider with polarized beams @xcite offers the possibility to verify very accurately the fundamental susy assumption that the yukawa couplings , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are indentical to the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "varying the left  handed and right  handed yukawa couplings leads to a significant change in the corresponding left  handed and right  handed production cross sections . combining the measurements of @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the process @xmath74",
    ", the yukawa couplings @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be determined to quite a high precision as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : th]b .",
    "the @xmath75 statistical errors have been derived for an integrated luminosity of @xmath76 and @xmath77 fb@xmath78 and for partially polarized beams .",
    "= 5.0 cm = 4.7 cm    -1 cm",
    "the measurement of the processes @xmath79 ( @xmath55=1,2,3,4 ) , carried out with polarized beams and combined with the analysis of the chargino system @xmath80 ( @xmath55=1,2 ) , can be used to perform a complete and precise analysis of the basic susy parameters in the gaugino / higgsino sector @xmath81 .",
    "the closure of the neutralino system can be verified by exploiting the sum rules for production cross sections .",
