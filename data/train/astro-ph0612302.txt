    "an x - ray burst source hete j1900.1 - 2455 was discovered by high energy transient explorer 2 ( hete-2 ) on 14 june 2005 .",
    "the position of the source was distributed through the gamma ray bursts coordinates network circular @xcite and the astronomer s telegram @xcite .",
    "the follow - up observations were performed by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on june 16 and 17 in 2005 with exposures of 1.14 ks and 5.46 ks respectively .",

    "@xcite observed the field of the sxc error circle with the robotic palomar 60-inch telescope with r - band and i - band from 07:27 to 07:57 ut on 18 june 2005 , and detected a previously unknown object at r.a .",

    "hete j1900.1 - 2455 is the seventh known accretion - powered millisecond pulsar .",
    "the sources of this class have some common properties .",
    "their orbital periods are distributed between 40 min and 120 min @xcite , spectra above 15 kev were described by power - law models with exponential cut - off ( for example @xcite ) , while low energy spectra need blackbody and/or disk blackbody components ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , through the observation of hete j1900.1 - 2455 by rxte , power - law and blackbody spectral features are found by @xcite and a hint of high energy emission is reported by @xcite .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig.asm ] shows the light curve of hete j1900.1 - 2455 observed by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on rxte .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the time of the first burst .",
    "the persistent flux of hete j1900.1 - 2455 suddenly brightened at the time of the first burst and remains almost constant after that .",
    "since the orbital period of the source is 83.3 min @xcite , the sudden brightening is not likely to be related to the orbital motion of the source .",
    "in contrast , the other accretion - powered millisecond pulsars are transients with typical decay time of a few weeks .",
    "according to @xcite , the mass of companion is probably between 0.016 @xmath6 and 0.07 @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite suggested the possibility that the companion was born as an object of a small mass , such as a brown dwarf or a planet , though the detailed path of evolution of the system is not clear .",

    "we report the timing and spectral properties of these five x - ray bursts from hete j1900.1 - 2455 observed during the summer of 2005 .",
    "the french gamma telescope ( fregate ) , the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ) , and the soft x - ray camera ( sxc ) instruments on board hete-2 detected an x - ray burst ( trigger i d h3804 ) at 11:22 ut on 14 june 2005 .",

    "( 80mm,)figure2.eps      in addition to the first burst on 14 june , hete-2/wxm detected four more x - ray bursts from the source on 17 june , 27 june , 7 july , and 21 july in 2005 .",
    "the burst on 14 june and 7 july were triggered events while the others were untriggered .",
    "for the second burst on 17 june the information of accurate spacecraft attitude was not available , because the optical camera system had been turned off about 100 seconds before the burst .",
    "the source position of the burst was found to be 0.6 degree off hete j1900.1 - 2455 if the attitude information of 100 seconds before the burst was used .",
    "we consider , however , that hete j1900.1 - 2455 is still the most likely source of this burst , as it is possible that the spacecraft attitude drifted 0.6 degree in 100 seconds , and there are no known x - ray sources within comparable distances .",
    "the time of the all events and their incident angles are summarized in table [ tab.obs ] .",
    "we note that the burst on 21 july was also detected by rxte @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in section [ section.spec ] , we showed that the spectra of all time interval are consistent with blackbody emission .",
    "all the bursts have the time regions which show the drops of blackbody temperature and the rises of source radius .",
    "these features can be interpreted as photospheric expansion at the eddington luminosity .",
    "the drop of blackbody temperature in the tail parts show cooling .",
    "all these results are consistent with eddington - limited type - i x - ray burst .    from the spectral fitting we obtained bolometric flux @xmath7 at the peak of each burst , and summarized in table [ tab.spec ] .",
    "the largest peak flux is that of the second burst , 1.21 @xmath8 [ ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 ] .",

    ", we should have detected bursts between 2001 and 2004 , if the source had been active as much as in 2005 .",
    "the absence of the burst before 2005 means that the source was `` turned on '' some time after the summer of 2004 .    in the insets of figure [ fig.asm ] , the time of the bursts are plotted with arrows .",
    "the figure clearly show the correspondence between persistent flux and burst activity of the source , which is the common behavior of bursts from the transient sources ( e.g. , cen x-4 : @xcite ; aql x-1 : @xcite ; x1608 - 522 : @xcite ) .",
    "these observations agree with theoretical predictions that bursts occur when the persistent flux is between 0.1% and 10% of the eddington luminosity @xcite . in the case of hete j1900.1 - 2455 , assuming the peak flux of the bursts reached the eddington luminosity , the persistent flux at the time of bursts is about 1% of the eddington luminosity . on the other hand , the upper limit of the persistent flux in the quiescent state",
    "is an order of magnitude smaller than in the active state , which can be read from figure [ fig.asm ] .",
    "these facts are consistent with the above theoretical expectation .",
    "we can see the bursts occurred somewhat regularly in june and july of 2005 except the first burst .",
    "unfortunately , the wxm did not point toward the source after early august .",
    "therefore we do not know the regularity of the bursts after the last burst .",
    "we should note here that the instruments on hete-2 are turned off during the half of the orbits , and observation efficiency is @xmath13% .",
    "there may be missing burst in the time interval of regular activity .",
    "we estimated @xmath14 value @xcite , which is ratio of the average persistent x - ray flux to the average flux emitted in bursts , using the information of persistent flux reported by @xcite . the average persistent flux in 2@xmath520 kev is @xmath15 erg @xmath3 sec@xmath4 during the observation .",
    "to calculate average flux emitted in bursts @xmath16 , we divided the burst fluence by the waiting time after the previous burst . since there may be some bursts we",
    "did not observed , @xmath16 that we calculated should be lower limit .",
    "the fluence of the 2nd , 3rd , 4th , and 5th bursts are @xmath0 2.0 , 1.1 , 0.96 , and 4.1 @xmath17 erg @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the waiting time of these bursts are 2.97 , 8.36 , 8.61 , and 12.4 @xmath18 sec .",
    "therefore upper limits of @xmath14 for these bursts are @xmath0 100 , 500 , 700 , and 200 .",
    "the @xmath14 for the 2nd burst is consistent with , the standard @xmath14 value for a pure helium atmosphere , which is @xmath0 100 .",
    "it is unlikely that more than three missing bursts were present between the waiting time , because the observation efficiency of wxm is roughly 0.5 .",
    "thus real @xmath14 of the 3rd and 4th bursts might not be lower than 150",
    ". this @xmath14 value may be slightly higher than standard value . here",
    "we note that the estimated bolometric persistent flux may be smaller than the real value , because the persistent emissions of this type of sources have bright power - law component in addition to the blackbody emission from the neutron star surface .",
    "the harder and the brighter spectral shape makes the larger difference between estimated and real bolometric persistent flux .",
    "however , the difference may not be larger than several tens percent of the estimated flux .",
    "more precise consideration is possible in comparing the @xmath14 value of hete j1900.1 - 2455 with other burst sources on the @xmath14 and @xmath19 plane , where @xmath19 is the bolometric persistent flux normalized with the bolometric peak flux of the burst .",
    "the studies of relation between @xmath14 and @xmath19 are summarized in @xcite , and there is a trend of lower @xmath14 for the source with lower @xmath19 . on the other hand , our results ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 , show high @xmath14 despite low @xmath19 .",
    "the other accreting millisecond pulsars with type - i x - ray bursts , which are sax j1808.4 - 3658 and xte j1814 - 338 @xcite , may show the same tendency .",
    "therefore , high @xmath14 in low @xmath19 might be a common property of the accreting millisecond pulsar , while the confirmation with larger samples is needed .",
    "the 5th burst had obviously longer duration than other four bursts , and smaller @xmath14 value at the same time . according to the model of hydrogen and helium flash",
    ", the burning of hydrogen together with helium makes the rise time longer and @xmath14 value smaller .",
    "since both short and long bursts have the indications of photospheric expansion , both bursts reach the eddington limit .",
    "generally the eddington limit corresponding to the hydrogen - rich matter should be lower than the case of the pure helium matter .",
    "the observed peak flux are , however , almost constant or slightly higher in the longer burst .",
    "these results are not fully understood in the framework of hydrogen and helium flash model .",
    "we discovered the new x - ray burst source hete j1900.1 - 2455 .",
    "we analyzed five x - ray bursts from the source .",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of the bursts are consistent with those of eddington - limited type - i bursts .",
    "if the peak luminosity of the bursts is the eddington luminosity of a standard 1.4 solar mass neutron star with a helium atmosphere , the distance to the source is @xmath0 4 kpc .",
    "the alpha values of the 3rd and 4th bursts , were estimated to be @xmath22150 . such a large value can be explained by the bright power - law component of the persistent emission .",
    "the long duration and lower @xmath14 value of 5th burst may indicate the hydrogen - rich composition of burst fuel .",
    "however the eddington limit of the burst is comparable to the other bursts .    9 arimoto ,  m. , et al .",
