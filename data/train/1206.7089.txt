    "the nature of the primary cosmic rays is intimately related to the astrophysical objects capable of accelerating these particles to such high energies . also , propagation in the intergalactic medium depends on the composition , which affects the resulting spectral distribution of the flux observed at earth .",
    "a knowledge of the composition is also very important for primary energy reconstruction and for anisotropy studies .",
    "one of the most important limitations of composition analyses comes from the lack of knowledge of the hadronic interactions at the highest energies .",
    "composition studies are based on the comparison of experimental data with monte carlo simulations of atmospheric cosmic rays showers , which makes use of hadronic interaction models which extrapolate the available low energy accelerator data to the energies of the cosmic rays .",
    "one of the most sensitive parameters to the mass of the primary cosmic ray is the atmospheric depth at which the showers reach their maximum development .",
    "lighter primaries generate showers that are more penetrating , producing larger values of @xmath0 . also , the fluctuations of this parameter are smaller for heavier nuclei . the pierre auger observatory and the hires experiment",
    "are able to observe directly the longitudinal development of the showers by means of fluorescence telescopes .",
    "therefore , in both experiments , the @xmath0 parameter of each observed shower can be reconstructed from the data taken by the telescopes .",
    "the mean value and the standard deviation of @xmath0 , as a function of primary energy , obtained by auger @xcite and hires @xcite appear to be inconsistent . from the comparison with simulations ,",
    "the auger data suggest a transition to heavier nuclei starting at energies of order of @xmath2 ev , whereas , the hires data are consistent with protons in the same energy range . in ref .",
    "@xcite a new parameter , the difference between the mean value and the standard deviation of @xmath0 , was introduced in order to reconcile the auger and hires results .",
    "this new parameter has the advantage of being much less sensitive to the first interaction point than the mean value and the standard deviation separately . from a comparison of the experimental values of this parameter , obtained by auger and hires , with simulated data ,",
    "they infer that the composition of the cosmic rays is dominated by protons .",
    "they say that the energy dependence of the distribution of @xmath0 , observed by auger , seems to be caused by an unexpected change in the depth of the first interaction point , which can be explained by a rapid increase of the cross section and/or increase of the inelasticity .",
    "both possibilities require an abrupt onset of new physics in this energy range , which makes them questionable .",
    "they also suggest that the deviation of the distribution of @xmath0 from the proton expectation , present in the auger data , could be originated in the statistical techniques used to analyze the data .",
    "in particular , they suggest that the deviation of the mean value of @xmath0 from the proton expectation could be explained by a bias originated from the exponential nature of the @xmath0 distribution and the decreasing number of events as a function of primary energy .    in this work we show that , considering a better description of the @xmath0 distribution , the bias in the determination of the mean value of @xmath0 become more than one order of magnitude smaller than the one obtained for the exponential distribution .",
