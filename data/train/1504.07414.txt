    "through the ages , the problem of 2d bloch electrons under an influence of vertical uniform magnetic field has attracted many interests of physicists . under two limiting conditions , i.e. only with either magnetic field or potential , discrete landau levels ( lls ) or continuous bloch bands",
    "are given as solutions @xcite , both of which are fundamental knowledge in solid state physics .",
    "a typical problem in the intermediate , or two - combined case is as follows : a single electron in a very strong potential under a weak magnetic field in an isotropic square lattice , where the hamiltonian reduces to a proper equation named `` harper equation '' @xcite .",
    "while analytic solution does not exist for general @xmath0 , the system shows two extremely intriguing properties : integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) and fractal energy band structure .",
    "the latter combines the adverse nature of the lls and the bloch bands , which is expressed in the energy diagram known as `` hofstadter s butterfly '' @xcite .",
    "the iqhe is described as a quantization of hall conductance @xmath1 , which usually occurs when the fermi energy lies between the lls .",
    "first discovered by von klitzing _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , this strikingly odd phenomenon has contributed to the development of condensed matter physics both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "for instance , since the theoretical explanation of iqhe was given first by laughlin @xcite based on the gauge invariance , physicists were further encouraged to demonstrate the validity of the method of gauge theory .",
    "et al . _ ( or tknn ) suggested that a noninteracting two - dimensional electron system always shows iqhe @xcite , which was later understood as the consequence of topological invariance of @xmath1 .",
    "namely , the hall conductance can be identified as a berry phase in the brillouin zone ( bz ) @xcite , which is gauge invariant , so that @xmath1 is stable unless the band gaps open and close @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the label of each gap is related to the hall conductance .",
    "as for the square lattice , a very simple yet powerful diophantic equation to associate @xmath1 with the gap label was discovered by tknn .",
    "however , the multivalency of the solution requires another rule to give the authentic @xmath1 , whose reasonable justification is still an open question .",
    "note that , of course one may compute @xmath1 directly from tknn formula if needed .",
    "other methods are streda formula @xcite and the adoption of lattice gauge theory techniques @xcite .",
    "while the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) has been a research topic , not so many works have focused on the fractality , an apparently interesting nature first confirmed by hofstadter with a help of continued fraction expansion @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we clarify the relation of the iqhe and the fractal structure . as a result",
    ", we find that the hall conductance at gaps between `` families '' ( the definition of a family is given in @xmath25 ) can be determined without numerical calculation , whose uniqueness is supported by a physical background .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "@xmath22 gives a brief derivation of harper equation , which is the proper equation in our system . in @xmath23",
    ", we estimate the conductance on the basis of the linear responce theory , and we describe the correspondence between the hall conductance and the energy spectrum . in @xmath24 , we divide the energy spectrum into `` subcells '' , employing the notation used by hofstadter .",
    "this enables us to state the grouping rules for families in @xmath25 .",
    "we discuss the relationship between two nature in @xmath26 , and the conclusion is given in @xmath27 .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian on an isotropic square lattice under a vertical uniform magnetic field is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator on the @xmath6 site , and @xmath7 is a transfer integral between @xmath6 and @xmath8 sites .",
    "peierls phase @xmath9 satisfies @xmath10 , with the right - hand side representing the magnetic flux per plaquette in units of magnetic flux quantum , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "when we choose the landau gauge @xmath12 , only the transfer integrals along the @xmath13 axis acquire nonzero peierls phase .",
    "using the cartesian coordinate @xmath14 of site @xmath6 ( @xmath15=integer ) , the peierls phase becomes @xmath16 for the link between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "let us assume @xmath19 is a rational number @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are coprime integers . in this case",
    "@xcite@xcite , the magnetic unit cell becomes @xmath22 times larger in the @xmath23-direction , and correspondingly the bz is @xmath22 times smaller than the original one . by a straightfoward calculation ,",
    "the hamiltonian is transformed to @xmath24 where each component is defined by @xmath25 with @xmath26 here , @xmath27 denotes the fermion operator in the reciprocal space , @xmath28 equation ( [ harper ] ) , which is called harper equation , is known to have @xmath22 bands when @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ butterfly_zero_mode ] shows the energy spectrum obtained by hofstadter @xcite .    .",
    "the blue circle indicates a dirac point.,width=377 ]    it was shown @xcite that two bands happen to cross linearly at zero energy , i.e. form a dirac cone , when @xmath22 is an even number . the blue circle shown in fig .",
    "[ butterfly_zero_mode ] indicates one of the dirac cone at @xmath30 .",
    "further more , the magnetic translation symmetry leads to a @xmath22-fold degeneracy of the brillouin zone in the direction of @xmath31 , which means that each ll is @xmath22-fold degenerate @xcite . in the vicinity of this dirac point",
    ", we can see that the vertical uniform magnetic field measured from the dirac point ( i.e. @xmath32 ) induces lls with their energy in proportion to @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the ll number .",
    "we refer these lls as `` the dirac lls '' , discriminating from `` the fermi lls '' with the ordinary linear energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the hall conductance of the @xmath35-th band is computed in the linear response theory as @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes the fermi distribution function .",
    "assuming zero temperature and sufficiently large system size , @xmath38 , ( [ sigmakubo ] ) is reduced to @xmath39\\\\ & = & \\gamma_n \\frac{e^2}{h},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where mbz means magnetic brillouin zone and @xmath40 is regarded as the berry phase in the brillouin zone @xcite . since the mbz is two - torus , @xmath40 is integer for arbitrary @xmath35 .",
    "as an example , we calculate the hall conductance as a function of fermi energy @xmath41 at @xmath42 as shown in fig .",

    "plateaux in family gaps , whose definitions are given in @xmath25 , are shown in blue lines and others in red lines.,width=377 ]    since there is a particle - hole symmetry , we discuss only the region of @xmath43 below .",
    "as @xmath41 decreases from @xmath44 , the conductance changes as @xmath45 as shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma_of_family2 ] .",
    "we can see that the hall conductance is constant between band gaps in the energy spectrum . in the following ,",
    "we clarify the relationship between the energy spectrum and the value of the conductance .",
    "in order to understand the behavior of hall conductance , we find it necessary to classify the magnetic bloch bands .",
    "first , we review minimum but sufficient information of the notion `` subcell '' which was first proposed by hofstader .",
    "we restrict our argument to @xmath46 since the identical diagram is given for the other @xmath19 s .",
    "there are three types of subcells : @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 subcells are the outermost bands as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) are in the regions of @xmath54 @xmath48 subcells consist of the center bands as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath53 ) are in the regions of @xmath56 note that the existence of gaps between the @xmath49 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 subcells enable us to determine the label of each band uniquely .",

    "( b ) expanded energy spectrum inside the @xmath57 subcell .",
    "yellow straight lines denote the centermost bands which have self - similar structure.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] ( b ) [ c1 ]    from fig .",
    "3(a ) we can see that each subcell , @xmath58 , contains the self - similar butterfly pattern as in the original one for @xmath59 .",
    "mathematically , as first claimed by hofstadter and proved by macdonald @xcite , an appropriate linear stretching of the local variable @xmath60 $ ] gives nearly the same diagram as the original butterfly pattern . here",
    "the term ` nearly ' reflects the fact that the streched diagram of @xmath51 and @xmath52 subcells differ from the original butterfly in that the gaps do not close at @xmath61 etc , although there are no gap in the original butterfly at @xmath62 .",
    "however , we do not need to discuss this difference further because in the following we restrict our argument on @xmath48 subcells in which gap closes at @xmath63 etc .",
    "the substructure inside @xmath55 can be classified again by @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the following ,",
    "we denote @xmath65 in @xmath55 as @xmath66 etc ; which means that `` @xmath67 subcell inside @xmath55 . ''",
    "note that repetition of such operation determines the division of the butterfly spectrum uniquely .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] [ family_label ]    next we introduce the concept of `` families '' in the hofstadter s butterfly .",
    "figure 4 shows the energy spectrum obtained for @xmath68 .",
    "the energy levels in @xmath57 is expanded in the r.h.s . of fig . 4 and the energy bands in @xmath57 are named in the method described in the previous section .",
    "we define these bands as families .    in order to understand these families , we use @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 integer ) @xcite : @xmath72 which were introduced by hofstadter to describe the continued fraction expansion . for example",
    ", @xmath68 can be expressed in various ways of continued fraction expansions as follows :    @xmath73    here @xmath74 represents the continued fraction @xmath75 and @xmath76 is @xmath77 .    in the general case , @xmath29 is expressed in various ways as @xmath78 the relation between the denominators is @xcite @xmath79",
    "we discuss the relationship between the hall conductance and the energy spectrum on the basis of the `` families '' .",
    "as shown in @xmath80 , the hall conductance are , -2 , -8 , -14 , -20 when @xmath81 .",
    "we find that the absolute values of @xmath1 are equivalent to the denominators of 1/2 , @xmath82 = 3/8 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 . in the general case ,",
    "when the magnetic flux is @xmath85 , we calculate @xmath86 .",
    "then the hall conductance when @xmath41 is located in the gap between @xmath87th and @xmath88-th family from the top is given by @xmath89    it is widely known that the hall conductance is quantized in unconventional way in the gaps of the dirac lls ( e.g. @xmath90 in graphene ) @xcite . therefore , we can expect the hall conductance to be quantized as @xmath91 when infinitesimal magnetic flux @xmath92 additionarily is imposed to @xmath93 . in our case",
    "@xmath42 , the family @xmath94 corresponds to the @xmath95 dirac ll originated from @xmath96 . as antisipated from fig .",
    "3(b ) , this @xmath95 dirac ll is broadened as @xmath19 decreases from 7/20 , and at @xmath68 , it becomes the family of @xmath94 .",
    "therefore the conductance when @xmath41 is just above this family becomes -20 which is determined for @xmath96 .",
    "similarly , the central three families correspond to the broadened @xmath95 dirac ll originated from @xmath97 . as a result , the conductance when @xmath41 is just above @xmath98 becomes -14 .",
    "details would be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the bands in 2d electron system under a vertical uniform magnetic field can be classified into families , which is a notion introduced to describe the recursive structure of the hofstadter s butterfly .",
    "the hall conductance when @xmath41 is located in the gaps between families is given by the denominator of the aborted continued fraction expansion .",
    "this can be physically understood from the two types of lls .",
