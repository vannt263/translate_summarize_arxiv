    "the capacity of cellular networks has been a classical and important issue for efficient radio resource management @xcite .",
    "the most improvement of the network capacity has come from reducing the cell size by installing more base stations such as femtocells @xcite .",
    "we may have a question ,  how much does the network capacity increase as we install more base stations ?",
    "\" unfortunately , answers to the question are not trivial , in particular when it comes to the case of multiple interfering base stations and mobile users .",
    "so far , the only attractable approach is to rely on simulations , where various models on radio channels and the spatial distribution of base stations and users are used . in this paper",
    ", we tackle the issue to derive closed form formulas for quickly answering the question .",
    "many previous studies on cellular networks assumed that base stations are positioned regularly and tractable analysis was performed only for a fixed location user ( e.g. , cell center or edge user ) @xcite .",
    "this regular model tends to overestimate the capacity of cellular networks owing to the perfect geometry of base stations and the neglect of weak interference from outer tier base stations . for this reason",
    ", we use the stochastic geometry approach , where base stations can be modeled as a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this ppp model is that we can derive the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) distribution at an arbitrary location considering random channel effects such as fading and shadowing .",
    "moreover , the ppp model reflects random location characteristics of base stations .",
    "this randomly located base station scenario exists in heterogeneous networks where a large number of microcell and femtocell base stations are deployed .",
    "particularly , user - deployed femtocells increase the randomness .",
    "the stochastic geometry approach has recently got much attention in particular for quantifying the co - channel interference in the wireless network ( see @xcite and literature therein ) .",
    "it has been applied to cdma cellular networks @xcite , cellular networks with multi - cell cooperation @xcite , femtocells @xcite , cognitive radio networks @xcite and csma / ca based wireless multihop networks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the _ downlink _ capacity of a cellular network , as closed form formulas , and evaluate its correctness by means of simulations . the most relevant research to our work is the one by andrews _ et al . _ @xcite . in that paper",
    ", the authors used a ppp modeling for the base station distribution but did not consider the user density .",
    "therefore , their results are useful for calculating the _ area _ outage probability , i.e. , the probability that an arbitrary location is under outage owing to the low sinr .",
    "a key observation in @xcite is that the area outage probability is independent of the base station density in interference limited cellular networks .",
    "this means that the network capacity linearly increases with the base station density .",
    "however , the result can be achieved under a assumption that every cell has saturated traffic .",
    "this is unreasonable as the number of base stations increases ; some of the small cells do not even have any user to serve . also , even if the user density is sufficiently high for the saturated traffic assumption , each base station can serve only one user in a resource block at a given time , which makes some users be under outage . therefore , we define and derive the _ user _ outage probability , the probability that an arbitrary user is under outage considering not only the sinr level but also the user selection .",
    "we assume base stations and mobile users are located with respective densities and radio channels fluctuate according to short - term fading and pathloss .",
    "the inter - cell interference is dependent on the frequency reuse factor but here we assume that every channel can be reused in every cell ( i.e. , the frequency reuse factor is 1 ) .",
    "the rest of the paper contains how we derive our results ( propositions 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "consider a downlink cellular network consisting of base stations ( bss ) and mobile users ( mus ) .",
    "many previous studies on cellular networks assumed that bss are positioned regularly .",
    "however , in reality , it is not true and there are some random characteristics . to remedy the model , we apply a homogeneous ppp to the spatial distribution of the bss such as @xcite-@xcite . besides , we consider the density of mus , where the mus are randomly distributed according to some independent homogeneous ppp with a different density .",
    "one can argue that the mu distribution may not be best modeled as the ppp . however , this is a tractable and reasonable approach as was also used in @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of bss follows ppp @xmath1 with the density @xmath2 , over which mus are positioned with ppp @xmath3 with the density @xmath4 .",
    "each mu is served by the nearest bs .",
    "this means that the cell area of each bs forms a _ voronoi tessellation _ @xcite as in figure [ voronoi ] .",
    "we assume that the radio channel attenuation is dependent on pathloss and rayleigh fading in our analysis .",
    "further , we consider log - normal shadowing as well in our simulations .",
    "we consider only one resource block at a given time and assume that only one mu is scheduled in the resource block .",
    "in other words , if there are multiple mus in the voronoi cell of a bs , then the bs can serve only one of them in the resource block .",
    "the resource block can be interpreted as a time slot ( in time division multiple access systems ) , a sub - carrier ( in frequency division multiple access systems ) or a scheduled slot ( in code division multiple assess systems ) .",
    "we assume that selection probabilities of the mus within a voronoi cell are equally likely ( i.e. , random selection with equal probability ) for the fairness . on the other hand",
    ", there might be some bss that do not have any mu to serve . in that case",
    ", the bss will not transmit any signal ( i.e. , inactive ) .",
    "the inactive probability may increase with the number of bss .",
    "in this section , we derive two important probabilities , _ inactive bs probability _ and _ user selection probability_. the inactive bs probability refers to the probability that a randomly chosen bs does not have any mu in its voronoi cell .",
    "this probability will be used for calculating the aggregate inter - cell interference in section iv .",
    "the user selection probability denotes the one that a randomly chosen mu is assigned a resource block at a given time and is served by the nearest bs .      at a given time",
    ", there can be some bss that do not have any mu in their voronoi cells .",
    "this happens when the bs density is high , e.g. , femtocells .",
    "those bss are inactive .",
    "we start with the probability density function of the size of a typical voronoi cell , which was derived by the monte carlo method @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a random variable that denotes the size of the typical voronoi cell normalized by the value @xmath7 . using ( [ eq : bs_size ] ) , we can derive the probability mass function of the number of mus in a typical voronoi cell :    * lemma 1 * : _ let the random variable @xmath8 denote the number of mus in the voronoi cell of a randomly chosen bs .",

    "therefore , there is small gap between our analysis and the simulation result as the bs density increases .",
    "however , the general shape of the curves exactly match each other .    in figure [ service_success_probability]-(b ) , we see that the service capacity is a concave function of the number of bss . in other words ,",
    "the average quality of service may not increase rapidly with the installation of additional bss , after some point .",
    "this is because some of small cells can not have any user to serve as the number of bss increases .",
    "moreover , increase of co - channel interference by a large number of bss leads to decrease of the marginal capacity .",

    "this is due to the fact that the higher pathloss will filter co - channel interference among the cells @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    ", the user selection probability can be approximated to one ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) and the density of the transmitting bss can be approximated to that of the mus ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) .",

    "this scenario is for the highly congested area like downtowns . in the case",
    ", inactive probability can be approximated to zero ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) and the density of the transmitting bss can be approximated to that of the existing bss ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) . therefore , service success probability and service capacity are given as follows : @xmath76 similarly , if we assume that the noise is negligible and @xmath71 , those are reduced to : @xmath77",
    "in this paper , we used the stochastic geometry approach and derived useful distributions and probabilities for cellular networks ( propositions 1 , 2 and 3 ) . using these , we calculated the density of success transmissions in the downlink cellular network that was defined as the service capacity ( proposition 4 ) .",
    "a key observation is that the success transmission density increases with the base station density , but the increasing rate diminishes .",
    "if the mu density is much higher than the bs density ( i.e. , saturated traffic condition ) and the noise is negligible ( i.e. , interference limited system ) , however , the success transmission density linearly increases with the bs density ( equation ( [ eq : aymptotic_2_simple ] ) ) .",
    "the limitation of our current work is as follows : first , we did not consider the shadow fading in the channel model of our analysis .",
    "even though we verified our results using simulations , extension to the shadow fading case seems to be necessary in particular shadowing are correlated @xcite .",
    "second , the user selection is equally likely in each base station .",
