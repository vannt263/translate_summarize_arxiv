    "analytically continuing physical parameters such as temperature and field to unphysical , even complex values , is often done in the study of equilibrium statistical mechanical models , for instance in determining the lee - yang @xcite and fisher @xcite zeroes for partition functions whose scaling properties provide an alternative approach to characterizing phase transitions .",
    "it has been less commonly practised for non - equilibrium models , though blythe and evans have considered `` normalization zeroes '' for the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) by taking complex injection or removal rates at the boundary and recovered the known phase diagram for the non - equilibrium steady states @xcite from the scaling properties of these zeroes .",
    "more recently , sasamoto and williams @xcite showed that choosing a negative injection rate at one boundary could relate the finite and semi - infinite partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) over the region in which the finite pasep was defined .",
    "in @xcite the interesting general question of whether one can still give a probabilistic or physical meaning to the corresponding stationary distribution if one makes one or more parameters negative or complex in finite markov chain models , such as the pasep , was posed .",
    "the pasep with a reverse hopping rate ( defined below ) of @xmath0 appears to be an example of a model with a probabilistic interpretation since we find that not only does the normalization remain positive but quantities such as the current and particle density continue to behave in a reasonable manner .",
    "an additional motivation for choosing @xmath0 comes from consideration of finite dimensional representations of the pasep algebra .",
    "such @xmath10-dimensional representations have been obtained when @xmath11 along lines in the non - equilibrium steady state phase diagram of the pasep given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are convenient parametrizations of the injection and extraction rates @xmath15 .",
    "however , they also exist when @xmath16 .",
    "these representations have not been considered before in the context of the pasep precisely because the hopping rate takes an unphysical value but the study of the @xmath17 spin chain , which is closely related to the pasep , at @xmath16 has been a topic of interest for many years @xcite .",
    "the simplest non - trivial example of such finite representations in the pasep is found when @xmath0 , giving the two dimensional representation whose properties we investigate here .",
    "we adopt a low - tech approach throughout , diagonalizing the @xmath18 matrices of the pasep algebra and explicitly calculating the current and density from these , which allows straightforward direct comparisons between the two - dimensional representations for @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly outline the existence of similar finite dimensional representations for @xmath16 ( and @xmath0 in particular ) when the boundary conditions are generalized .",
    "we also discuss the lattice path interpretation of the generating function for the pasep normalization and note that a different representation of the pasep algebra related to the q - harmonic oscillator does _ not _ admit finite dimensional representations , at least in an obvious manner , because it is no longer possible to implement the boundary conditions .",
    "we start with the standard setup for the pasep with continuous time markov dynamics on a finite lattice of length @xmath19 with open boundaries .    a typical particle configuration with allowed moves and rates in the pasep model .",
    "particles are injected on the left at a rate @xmath2 when a space is available and leave at a rate @xmath3 on the right .",
    "their internal hopping rates are @xmath5 to the right and @xmath1 to the left when spaces are available . ]    specifying the various injection , extraction and hopping rates for particles as shown in fig.(1 ) defines the model .",
    "the model is clearly out of equilibrium since it supports a current driven by the injection and extraction of particles but non - equilibrium steady states can exist .",
    "the matrix product ansatz solution for the pasep , @xcite calculates the probability @xmath20 of a given configuration @xmath21 in a non - equilibrium steady state by employing two vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 to sandwich a word @xmath24 generated from an alphabet of two matrices @xmath25 representing particles and holes in the configuration @xmath21 .",
    "this gives @xmath26 where the normalization for lattice of length @xmath19 is @xmath27 and we have defined @xmath28 .",
    "these expressions are then related to the dynamics of the pasep by imposing a quadratic algebra and boundary conditions on the matrices @xmath25 and vectors @xmath22,@xmath23 @xmath29 exact solutions for any @xmath19 may then be obtained by finding representations of the matrices and vectors or by normal - ordering the matrices to let them act on the appropriate boundary vector .",
    "the end result @xcite is a phase diagram for the non - equilibrium steady states of the pasep which contains a low - density ( @xmath30 ) a high density ( @xmath31 ) and a maximal current ( @xmath32 ) phase as the boundary rates @xmath33 are varied , with the transition lines between the various phases being shown in fig.(2 ) .",
    "a novel feature is that a one - dimensional non - equilibrium system can exhibit ( boundary driven ) phase transitions , unlike its equilibrium counterparts in one dimension such as the ising model .",
    "the phase diagram of the pasep . here",
    "hd , ld and mc denote the high - density , low - density and maximal - current phases , respectively . the mean field line ( a hyperbola ) @xmath34",
    "is indicated , below which no finite dimensional representations exist when @xmath11 .",
    "we also show the dashed line @xmath7 along which the physical two dimensional representation may be defined , taking @xmath35 for definiteness . ]    in general , representations of the pasep algebra are non - unique and will be infinite dimensional .",
    "the particular choice of representation which we find useful here is related to al - salam chihara @xcite polynomials and is given by @xcite @xmath36 and @xmath37 where the various parameters which appear are defined as @xmath38 with these choices the matrix @xmath39 is @xmath40 and the normalization @xmath41 in equ.([eqn : zdef ] ) may then be calculated using various techniques .",
    "similar expressions involving @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which we discuss below explicitly for both @xmath44 and @xmath45 , may also be evaluated for the current and density .    in the sequel",
    "we first reiterate the known results for the physical two - dimensional representation which exists when @xmath7 , before going on to consider @xmath0 .",
    "we compare the features of physical quantities such as the current and densities in both these representations and also discuss the representation related to the q - harmonic oscillator where , at least naively , continuation to @xmath0 does not appear to be possible .",
    "we conclude with some general comments on other representations with @xmath16 for @xmath46 and various possible generalizations .",
    "the study of finite dimensional representations of the pasep algebra and other quadratic algebras associated with different reaction - diffusion models pre - dated the exact matrix product solution of the pasep @xcite .",
    "it is useful to think of @xmath39 as a transfer matrix ( indeed , when the pasep is mapped onto a lattice path model , as discussed in section 7 , it _ is _ a transfer matrix ) so looking at equ.([c ] ) we can see that an @xmath10-dimensional representation will exist if @xmath47 since this decouples the matrix into blocks .",
    "only the block in the upper left - hand corner will give a non - zero scalar product with the vectors @xmath48 .",
    "one way this can occur is if @xmath49 , which restricts us to hyperbolic lines in the @xmath50 plane of the pasep phase diagram for physical values of @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath6 ) .",
    "the simplest of these is @xmath51 , giving @xmath52 which is just the mean field line for the pasep , as indicated on fig.(2 ) .",
    "all the other finite dimensional representations may be defined on hyperbolae which lie above this , for instance the two - dimensional representation when @xmath7 , which is shown in fig.(2 ) for @xmath35 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the two - dimensional representation at @xmath0 with this other , physical , two - dimensional representation which exists along the line @xmath7 for @xmath53 .",
    "this latter has been discussed by both essler and rittenberg @xcite and mallick and sandow @xcite in some generality , including the possibility of extraction at a rate @xmath54 at the left boundary and injection at a rate @xmath55 at the right boundary .",
    "the overall structure of the phase diagram is not altered by this embellishment ( at least when @xmath56 ) so we largely stick to the case of @xmath57 for simplicity .",
    "the line @xmath7 can cross the transition between the @xmath31 and @xmath30 phases in fig.(2 ) as @xmath33 are varied , so we must choose either @xmath58 or @xmath59 depending on the dominant eigenvalue . taking the former for definiteness ( i.e. the @xmath31 phase ) ,",
    "@xmath39 is given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath43 by @xmath62 the vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 are simply truncated to two components @xmath63 for the @xmath30 phase we exchange @xmath64 , and it is straightforward to verify that both the quadratic algebra relation and boundary conditions of equ.([eqn : decommute ] ) are still satisfied in both phases",
    ".    the off - diagonal elements of @xmath39 in this representation are imaginary but the expressions contributing to physical quantities such as the current and densities are real and positive .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath39 are @xmath65 and it may thus be diagonalized using @xmath66 and @xmath67 this gives @xmath68 and we can also define @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are both lower diagonal in the new basis @xcite @xmath71 which , as we shall see below , simplifies the expressions for densities ( and correlators ) somewhat by comparison with @xmath0 .",
    "the vectors @xmath72 in the diagonalized basis are given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and the combinations contributing to physical quantities again contrive to be real and positive .",

    "we may evaluate two point correlators in a similar manner , giving exponential correction terms which continue to play a role only near the left boundary for the connected correlator .",
    "similar expressions may be evaluated for the @xmath30 phase @xcite , here the density stays low in the bulk before increasing exponentially at the right boundary and the connected correlator corrections are non - zero only close to the right hand boundary .",
    "the results might be summarized by saying that for both the @xmath31 and @xmath30 phases one of the boundary rates ( @xmath94 or @xmath95 respectively ) dominates the behaviour and corrections to the bulk are seen at one of the boundaries ( left or right respectively ) only .",
    "the maximal current phase is inaccessible to the two - dimensional representation along @xmath7 as can be seen in fig.(2 ) .",
    "since @xmath96 when @xmath16 , @xmath10-dimensional representations also exist if @xmath1 is taken to be a root of unity .",
    "let us ignore any qualms about the physical interpretation of such values of @xmath1 and simply set @xmath0 to find another two - dimensional representation with the following expressions for @xmath39 @xmath97 and the individual @xmath25 @xmath98 the expressions for the vectors remain the same as the other two - dimensional representation at @xmath7 @xmath99 and both the quadratic algebra relation and boundary conditions of equ.([eqn : decommute ] ) can be seen to be satisfied here too .",
    "it is simpler to diagonalize @xmath39 for explicit calculations just as it was for @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath39 now has the eigenvectors @xmath100 so we may use @xmath101 and @xmath102 to diagonalize , where we have defined @xmath103 and @xmath104 for conciseness . the natural range of the parameters @xmath50 when @xmath0 is @xmath105 , since the physical injection and extraction rates satisfy @xmath106 .",
    "the eigenvalues thus range over @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "we would therefore not expect any phase transitions , which require @xmath109 , since this is not possible for physical values of @xmath33 unlike the @xmath7 representation .",

    "a naive continuation to @xmath0 from the maximal current phase which extends to @xmath124 gives the value of @xmath122 observed here for @xmath0 at @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath41 and hence @xmath82 contain exponential corrections which oscillate in sign , a feature which is also apparent in the density , which we turn to next .    if we evaluate the density @xmath132 the individual terms in the numerator no longer remain positive , for example @xmath133 but the numerator as a whole _ does _ stay positive .",

    "the various coefficients in the above are given by @xmath136 as with the current , the behaviour of the central ( bulk ) density appears to be physically reasonable . from equ.([zntau ] ) and fig.(5 ) we can see that the central density @xmath137 depends on both @xmath95 and @xmath94 , rather than just @xmath94 as in the @xmath31 phase and @xmath95 in the @xmath30 phase when @xmath138 . from fig.(5 )",

    "the horizontal steps may be composed into two different `` colours '' , weighted by @xmath199 and @xmath200 respectively , so the model is really one of bi - coloured motzkin paths , which are of considerable interest to combinatorialists because may be put into bijection with numerous other objects .    in the lattice path model",
    "the dominant paths contributing to the normalization in the @xmath31 and @xmath30 phases contain mostly one colour of step bound closely to the horizontal axis , where the binding energies are given in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the maximal current phase , on the other hand , corresponds to unbound paths in which entropy dominates @xcite . restricting @xmath39 to be finite in this context",
    "means that the heights of the paths in the ensemble are restricted to lie below a ceiling determined by the dimension of the representation .",

    "the generating function of @xmath41 in the q - harmonic oscillator representation could also be viewed as a motzkin lattice path model since the matrices there are still tridiagonal , but in this case the form of the vectors in equ.([qvec ] ) means that the paths may start and end at _ any _ height , showing why a consistent truncation to height zero and one paths does not appear to be possible in that case .",
    "we have seen that a two - dimensional representation of the pasep quadratic algebra at @xmath0 presents broadly reasonable physical behaviour , although the oscillating sign exponential corrections at both ends are unusual .",
    "we compared its properties in detail with the two - dimensional representation which exists when @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "the behaviour when the boundary conditions were extended to non - zero @xmath54 and @xmath55 was found to be similar , in that two - dimensional physical representations existed when parameters were restricted appropriately , e.g. @xmath7 or @xmath201 , alongside another two - dimensional representation when @xmath0 .",
    "we found that a naive continuation to @xmath0 was not possible for the representation of the pasep related to the q - harmonic oscillator because of the form of the vectors @xmath22,@xmath23 in that case and presented some heuristic arguments from a weighted lattice path interpretation of the pasep as to why such behaviour might have been expected .",
    "exploring @xmath10-dimensional representations for @xmath202 would be a possible extension of the current work , but we note that in such cases the @xmath41 is no longer necessarily real when expressed as a function of real @xmath33 so extracting a physical interpretation for currents , densities and correlators may not be quite so straightforward .",
    "having already allowed the unphysical value of @xmath0 in the two - dimensional representation , one might also take unphysical values of @xmath50 in that case .",
    "it would then be possible to arrange @xmath203 , and hence a phase transition , at @xmath204 .",

    "<S> we note that these quantities behave in an _ a priori _ reasonable manner in spite of the apparently unphysical value of @xmath1 as the input , @xmath2 , and output , @xmath3 , rates are varied over the physical range of @xmath4 to @xmath5 .    as is well known , another two dimensional representation exists when @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and we compare the behaviour at @xmath0 with this . an extension to generalized boundary conditions where particles may enter and exit at both ends is briefly outlined . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that a different representation related to the q - harmonic oscillator does not admit a straightforward truncation when @xmath0 and discuss why this is the case from the perspective of a lattice path interpretation of the pasep normalization . </S>"
