    "the concept of squeezed state has been established in the language of physics mainly by the developments in quantum optics . on the other hand , basic requirement of finding",
    "a system in a squeezed state is to have bosons as the constituents of the system interacting in a pairwise manner and that might be fulfilled not only in optical systems but in some other bose - type systems as well . in actual fact , the introduction of squeezed states in optics @xcite was based on the previous consideration of superfluidity@xcite in liquid @xmath0 ( also see @xcite ) . while squeezing of quantum fluctuations is the most well - known aspect of squeezed states , rich variety of effects might be expected due to their interesting statistical properties even at thermal equilibrium .",
    "certain effects like anti - bunching have already been observed in the realm of quantum optics and this makes it an intriguing question how to find squeezed states and their effects in other places . in this context , few proposals have been suggested for the generation and detection of squeezed states of bose - type excitations in solids@xcite .",
    "quite recently , squeezed phonons have been produced and detected@xcite .",
    "it is very interesting that , unlike the case of light , the squeezed states of phonons may arise from different microscopic interactions in solids even at thermal equilibrium @xcite . deviations from typical equilibrium distribution of phonons , namely bose - einstein distribution , might arise from anharmonic interactions among phonons or from some other mechanisms such as the polariton coupling in ionic crystals @xcite or polaron mechanism @xcite . in such cases , equilibrium distribution of phonons",
    "are that of squeezed thermal phonons@xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems to be an important question how to determine the equilibrium distribution of phonons when there is a possibility that phonons can be found to be in non - classical states . as a particular example of some considerable interest , the squeezed states of phonons due to the photon - optical phonon interaction in an ionic crystal @xcite should be mentioned here .",
    "the polariton coupling in such a system is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath1 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the photon frequency , @xmath3 is the frequency of transversal oscillations of optical phonons , @xmath4 is the polariton coupling constant and the operators @xmath5 describe the annihilation of photons and optical phonons respectively .",
    "since the hamiltonian under consideration is the hermitian bilinear form , it can be diagonalized by the bogolubov canonical transformation @xcite similar to that used in the definition of squeezed states @xcite . as a result",
    ", the thermal equilibrium state of the system is described by the following density matrix @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the hamiltonian @xmath8 in diagonal ( polariton ) representation and @xmath9 is the reciprocal temperature . in analogy to the quantum optics , consider the so - called degree of coherence @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the average with respect to the density matrix @xmath12 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate @xmath13 as a function of temperature for typical parameters of an ionic crystal ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . one can see that , at low temperatures , @xmath14 , while the same correlation function calculated with the bose - einstein distribution gives @xmath15 .",
    "it is also seen that the strong quantum fluctuations can be observed only below @xmath16 because they are eroded by thermal fluctuations with the increase of temperature .",
    "in contrast to the case of non - classical states of photons there is no an efficient direct method of measurement allowing the characterization of the quantum state of bose - type excitations in solids@xcite .",
    "even though correlation functions to any order would be demanded to describe fully a quantum state , it is usually good enough to distinguish quantum states by their number variances@xcite . here",
    ", we present a way to determine the number variance of phonons at equilibrium in a raman active medium .",
    "it is already suggested that correlation raman spectroscopy may be used to measure the quantum statistical properties of a vibration mode for the case of stokes ( s ) type raman scattering through a measurement of the intensity and the mandel s q - factor of the rayleigh mode@xcite .",
    "however , even at low temperatures vacuum fluctuations of the anti - stokes ( as ) modes might disturb measurements of high order correlations and thus careful study of the role of the as modes in such measurements is demanded . in this article , we follow a similar ideology in more general terms by examining both the s and as components of multi - mode raman scattering . even though the problem becomes analytically intractable when as modes",
    "are included , it is now possible to establish an interesting connection between the number variance of phonons and the correlations of s and as modes .",
    "moreover , due to the removing low temperature restriction in the exclusion of as modes , influence of temperature in the high order quantum correlations can be examined as well .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , using a general model of raman type three - body scattering , we find the inter - mode correlation function of s and as modes .",
    "discussion of this general result under standard approximations of raman scattering , with an emphasis of modifications in their range of validity , is subject to sec.iii .",
    "finally , sec.iv gives a brief summary of our results and conclusions .",
    "general relations between the correlation function of s and as modes and the number variance of phonons is developed in this section for the following raman - type hamiltonian , @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the @xmath19-mode with momentum @xmath20 and corresponding frequency @xmath21 . here",
    "the mode index @xmath22 stands for stokes , anti - stokes , vibration and rayleigh modes , respectively . as usually , the polarization labels are suppressed within the momentum symbols for the sake of notational simplicity .",
    "coupling constants are denoted by @xmath23 for the s - type scattering and @xmath24 for the as - type scattering .",
    "while writing this tri - linear bosonic hamiltonian we assumed as usually @xcite that the raman scattering is observed under the condition @xmath25 when the pair - wise creation of radiation modes has quite small probability so that energy is conserved .",
    "this supposition is equivalent to the rotating wave approximation of the quantum optics@xcite .",
    "we also assumed that the radiation consists of three @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 pulses which are well - separated on the frequency domain so that @xmath29 = \\delta_{{\\bf kk^{\\prime}}}\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda^{\\prime}}$ ] .",
    "if a single - mode strong coherent ( classical ) pumping is assumed , all one can expect is that the phase - matching conditions would have limited the number of active phonon modes to one .",
    "nevertheless , it seems to be reasonable to consider the raman scattering by an infinite markoffian system of phonons@xcite . in particular",
    ", it permits oneself to take into account the broadening of @xmath27 and @xmath28 lines .",
    "the usual selection rules of raman scattering , namely phase - matching or quasi - resonance conditions@xcite , are not essential for the derivation of the general relations below .",
    "therefore , the results given in this section are also valid in not so perfect raman coupling situations which should be important in real materials .",
    "if we define the number operator @xmath30 for the @xmath19-mode with momentum @xmath20 as @xmath31 , then the total number operator @xmath32 for @xmath19-mode becomes @xmath33 .",
    "heisenberg equations of motion yield the conservation laws , also known as manley - rowe relations@xcite , @xmath34 here constant operators @xmath35 are specified by the initial conditions .",
    "similar relations can also be constructed for the scattering of photons of a monochromatic laser beam from a dispersionless optical phonon@xcite . solving these equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 ,",
    "the s and as correlation function is found to be @xmath38 where the correlation function @xmath39 of two operators @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 and hence variance of operator @xmath42 is given by the self - correlation function @xmath43 . here the averages @xmath44 are with respect to the initial state since heisenberg picture is used .",
    "it is natural to consider an initial state in which the @xmath27 and @xmath28 modes are in their vacuum states , when we obtain , @xmath45 an operator @xmath42 at time @xmath46 is indicated by @xmath47 while initially by @xmath48 .",
    "that equation connects the s and as correlation function to the quantum statistical behavior of phonons and pump photons .    within conventional raman theory quantum properties of pump",
    "are usually neglected through the classical pump assumption@xcite .",
    "this approximation introduces a time range to the problem during which changes in the pump intensity remains negligible .",
    "we can apply a similar approximation by assuming an intense laser pump with photons in coherent states and performing a mean field average over them in the above equations . under this assumption",
    ", the correlation function of the s and as modes is related only to phonon statistics and the initial , known , number variance of the pump photons . however",
    ", time range of validity for the parametric approximation should be modified in our case .",
    "as we shall show in the subsequent section , statistical behavior of the pump might change significantly in shorter time than the occurance of a significant change in its intensity .",
    "our purpose is to examine the equilibrium statistics of phonons determined by @xmath49 ; therefore we need to express all time dependent terms on the right hand side of the eq.4 in terms of initial operators to see any further relation between the s and as correlation function and the equilibrium variance of phonons . for that aim",
    "we specify a model system and study its dynamics .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that a similar relation can be derived for the molecular raman model , which is equivalent to the full bosonic raman model under holstein - primakoff approximation in the case of low excitation density@xcite . in that case ,",
    "s and as correlations depend on the quantum statistics of population distributions of the molecular energy levels .",
    "in reality , coupling of one vibration mode to the pump beam for sufficiently long time of measurement is not an easy task .",
    "therefore , in this section we investigate a raman scattering in which coupling of pump photons to all phonon modes are allowed .",
    "we shall treat the pump as an intense coherent beam of photons and thus its state @xmath50 in general is described by a multimode coherent state , @xmath51 in which @xmath52 are the coherence parameters of the modes @xmath53 . according to the remarks at the end of previous section , we now perform mean field averaging with respect to pump photon states in eq.1 assuming the raman - active material is placed in an ideal cavity which selects single modes for s and as radiations , namely @xmath54 .",
    "then after dropping constant terms the hamiltonian in eq.1 reduces to an effective one , @xmath55 where new effective coupling constants @xmath56 are introduced by @xmath57 the summation above can be calculated once the density of states for the pump is also specified .",
    "as one can see , the hamiltonian will be in the given form , involving summations over phonon modes , in all cases except the case of perfectly phase matched single pump and phonon modes . in order to make sure that our results are not too susceptible to any imperfectness of the system arising from multi - mode nature of pump or phase - mismatches among the phonon and photon modes",
    ", we shall treat the problem using the model described by the above hamiltonian involving summations over phonon modes .",
    "when finite number of phonon modes are assumed , which is reasonable for real crystals of finite size , then such a model becomes integrable since the dynamics is ruled by the following closed set of operator linear differential equations , @xmath58 let us introduce a vector of operators such that @xmath59^{t}$ ] .",
    "we denote the matrix of coefficients in the above set of equations by @xmath60 and its diagonalizing matrix by @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 with eigenvalues @xmath63 . thus , we get @xmath64 where summation over repeated index is implied .",
    "it is therefore possible to write the solution for @xmath65-modes in the form , @xmath66 operators without time arguments are taken at @xmath67 .",
    "time dependent parameters @xmath68 are determined by the elements of matrix @xmath61 and eigenvalues @xmath63 .",
    "let us note here that some general relations exists among @xmath68 due to the commutation relations for @xmath69 operators and they are not independent each other . more explicit way of evaluating @xmath68 is presented below for the single mode phonon case where vector @xmath70 reduces to three dimensions in operator space .",
    "when there are no scattered light modes initially , the correlation function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 modes becomes @xmath71 here , parameters @xmath72 are functions of @xmath68 .",
    "since the summations above can be converted into integrals involving phonon density of states , we see that if there are van hove singularities corresponding to the modes selected by raman scattering , as in the case of recent experiments on the generation of non - classical phonon states via raman scatterings@xcite , then the correlation of @xmath27 and @xmath28 modes will be determined strongly by that mode .",
    "if this not the case , then one can still expect domination of the modes obeying raman selection rules .",
    "then for that mode the random phase approximation permits us to write@xcite @xmath73 in which the momentum label corresponding to relevant mode is fixed and dropped for the notational simplicity and primed parameters evaluated at that mode .",
    "it is possible to argue by the results above that a measurement of the correlation between s and as can be utilized to determine the variance of vibration modes , which we usually consider as phonons here , provided one knows the mean number of such modes initially .",
    "the latter information can be determined by either one of the first two relations in eq .",
    "12 after measurement of radiation mode intensities .",
    "also measurement of radiation mode intensities and the knowledge of initial phonon number allow one to keep track of the evolution of mean phonon number through the manley - rowe relations given by the eq.(2 ) .",
    "interestingly , since the mean number of phonons with non - classical distributions deviate significantly from that of bose - einstein distribution , it might be possible to find some traces of non - classicality even here .",
    "however , in order to classify the distribution of phonons strictly it would still be necessary to find the next moment of the distribution , in other words the variance of phonons .",
    "now , an explicit way of determining @xmath68 parameters will be demonstrated for the case of a single phonon mode .",
    "because of three dimensional operator space in this situation , eigenvalues @xmath74 are found to be as the roots of the cubic equation @xmath75 + \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\omega_{v}(\\omega_{v}^{2}-\\omega_{r}^{2})=0 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing coefficients @xmath76 as @xmath77 we write the field operators as @xmath78 common operator coefficients @xmath79 are determined in terms of the operators @xmath80 using the cramer s rule @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the matrix obtained by replacing the elements in the @xmath84th column of @xmath61 by the column vector @xmath85^{t}$ ] .",
    "thus , parameters @xmath68 are determined in terms of interaction constants and the frequencies .",
    "more explicit expressions are too long and not very illuminating to reproduce here , but above analysis is quite suitable for numerical computation when some experimental data is available . at that moment",
    "we shall content ourselves with more fundamental discussions only .    in order to give a brief discussion of the dependence of the correlation function in eq.9 on squeezing parameter and temperature",
    ", we consider an equilibrium distribution of vibration mode as of the squeezed thermal state with the following mean number and number variance@xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mean number of phonons according to bose - einstein ( be ) distribution and @xmath88 is the real squeezing parameter . when @xmath89 , we recover the usual be - distribution .",
    "according to eq.10 the @xmath27 and @xmath28 correlations increases with variance of phonons . and",
    "since both the @xmath90 and the @xmath91 increases with temperature due to eq.12 , we see that temperature enforces stronger correlations of @xmath27 and @xmath28 modes .",
    "however , we need to put a word of caution here , since the fluctuations which are determined by the self - correlations of the modes also increases with the temperature . in order to represent this competition",
    ", one can consider the cross - correlation function defined by@xcite @xmath92 since the denominator can be expressed in a similar structure as with the correlation function in eq.10 , the cross correlation function will eventually saturate at high temperatures and at high squeezing parameters . therefore , at high temperatures thermal fluctuations becomes important but not more important than in any typical quantum measurement .",
    "an estimation for a typical ionic crystal , for example , shows that the level of quantum fluctuations of phonon number exceeds that of thermal fluctuations below @xmath93k @xcite .",
    "we also see through eq.10 and eq.12 that @xmath27 and @xmath28 correlation increases with the squeezing parameter @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we examine the time range of validity for the parametric approximation . for that aim",
    ", we consider the hamiltonian given in ( 1 ) for the case of perfect coupling of single modes .",
    "let us suppress the momentum within the mode labels @xmath94 and calculate @xmath95 for times close to the beginning of interaction@xcite .",
    "up to the second order , we get @xmath96 where @xmath97 . here , operators at @xmath67 are those without time arguments .",
    "then , we calculate the mean number and the variance of pump photons for s and as modes are in vacuum states initially as @xmath98 in these equations averaging symbol , @xmath44 , is not shown . using the relation for a coherent field",
    ", we find the time ranges @xmath99 , for which the field intensity and the variance remain close to their initial values , as @xmath100 clearly , we see a rescaling of time range of the usual time range of parametric approximation . at low temperatures @xmath101 and",
    "thus @xmath102 shows a reduction of time range to @xmath103 of the typical range of parametric approximation . as an estimation , we may take @xmath104@xcite , giving time ranges as @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ". these ranges are readily available due to the remarkable recent developments in the field of femto - second spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "summing up our results , we should stress that the measurement of stokes  anti - stokes correlations looks like a reasonable method for detecting the number variance of a raman - active vibration mode in solids .",
    "the most interesting and crucial fact is that the above method permits us to determine the number variance at thermal equilibrium , in other words , the variance just before the application of the pump beam .",
    "the phonon sub - system could be be in a non - classical state due to an interaction providing necessary correlations among phonons before the pump beam is applied .",
    "that interaction could be some anharmonic coupling with the heat bath , polaron or polariton mechanisms .",
    "since these mechanisms are usually weaker than the first order raman effect , after the application of the pump beam , dynamics of the phonon system is governed mainly by the raman effect .",
    "therefore , initial non - classical state of phonons and non - classical effects like squeezing which require phase coherence might be destroyed .",
    "that is why we have determined the general and fundamental formula given by eq.4 in terms of the initial state of phonons and showed that under certain conditions it provides direct information on the initial , thermal equilibrium variance of phonons . analyzing those conditions of applicability , we propose that at liquid @xmath107 temperatures , using an intense coherent beam of ultra - fast laser source such as @xmath108-sapphire as a pump for a raman active medium , one can measure the number correlation of the scattered stokes and anti - stokes modes and the mean photon numbers in these modes simultaneously by some photon counters , in order to determine the number variance of the vibration mode at equilibrium .",
    "the measurement can be realized through the use of a homodyne - type scheme@xcite in which the @xmath27 and @xmath28 photons are counted by two different detectors connected with a computer fixing the simultaneous arrival of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 photons .",
    "it is also shown that when the vibration mode is in squeezed state then an increase in the correlation of the stokes and anti - stokes modes occurs .",
    "case of a multi - mode pump , important for ultra - short pulses , can be handled easily for materials which involves a strongly preferred phonon mode due to a van hove singularity in the frequency range of the pump , by an appropriate calculation of the effective coupling constants defined by eq.7 which in turn modify only the coefficients @xmath109 in eq.12 .",
    "thus our conclusions should also be valid in this case . for materials in which such phonon modes are many or not exists at all , then application of a multi - mode pump and measurement of stokes - anti - stokes correlation would still provide information on multi - mode phonon correlations according to the general formula eq.11 .",
    "this is a valuable knowledge to classify a possible non - classical multi - mode state of phonons like a multi - mode squeezed state .",
    "so far , the best achievement in squeezing of phonons is reported to be @xmath110 @xcite , provided by second order raman scattering .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this is not the squeezing parameter @xmath88 of eq.12 but related to @xmath111 .",
    "hence , the change in the stokes  anti - stokes correlations we expect to be in the same order .",
    "there are other mechanisms which result in non - classical excitations in solids with different expressions and larger values for @xmath88 and @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , squeezing parameter reflects the strength of interaction preparing the non - classical state of these excitations@xcite , which is the initial phonon state in our scheme .",
    "the example of optical polariton we have discussed in the introduction , provides a two - mode squeezed state with squeezing parameter in the range @xmath113 in @xmath114@xcite .",
    "therefore , such a measurement with the ultrafast raman correlation spectroscopy should not be too challenging and looks promising in our opinion .",
    "let us finally note that the case of molecular raman spectroscopy can also be treated with a similar formalism to get information on the quantum statistics of populations of molecular energy levels .",
