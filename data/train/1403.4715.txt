    "despite two decades of extensive studies the detailed structure of the superconducting order parameter in sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 remains unclear  @xcite .",

    "the invariance of the spin susceptibility on entering the superconducting state with the magnetic field @xmath14 both parallel and perpendicular to the ruo@xmath5 layers was argued to be consistent with very weak spin - orbit coupling in sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6 , so that the @xmath15-vector representing the orientation of the spin - triplet pairing state would always rotate to be perpendicular to @xmath14 for @xmath16  mt  @xcite , where @xmath17 is the vacuum magnetic permeability .",
    "however , this scenario is in direct conflict with the suppression of the in - plane upper critical field @xmath18 ( @xmath19  t ) at low temperatures @xmath0  @xcite , reminiscent of the strong pauli pairbreaking limit in spin - singlet pair states  @xcite or a spin - triplet pair state with the @xmath15-vector parallel to the field  @xcite .",
    "indeed , with the assumption that the @xmath15-vector is locked in some direction in the basal plane , the suppression of @xmath18 could possibly be explained by the inclusion of pauli pairbreaking  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies in the orientation of the @xmath15-vector are even aggravated by the extreme sensitivity of the @xmath18 suppression  @xcite as well as by the in - plane anisotropy of @xmath20  @xcite to the precise field alignment .",
    "although introducing a multi - component order parameter seems rather unconvincing that it might apply to all cases  @xcite , it might be relevant to the chiral - nonchiral transition in vortex states  @xcite or even to the first - order transition to the normal state  @xcite . further complicating matters , one set of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments was consistent with a single nodeless gap on all three fermi surfaces of sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6  @xcite , but in another stm experiment , the tip was placed in a spot with substantial normal regions for @xmath21  @xcite , completely disguising any possible superconducting order parameter form . to gain a possibly consistent interpretation to all pieces of experimental evidence",

    "the two chiral states @xmath25 with @xmath26 are believed to be stabilized near @xmath27  @xcite , while with @xmath28 , only the four helical states with @xmath15-vectors lying in the basal plane could be consistent with the in - plane @xmath18 measurements  @xcite by including the effects of pauli limiting  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the the assumption of very weak spin - orbit coupling , allowing the @xmath15-vector to rotate to a direction perpendicular to @xmath14 , that was argued to explain the knight shift observations for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 , sufficiently strong spin - orbit coupling should be assumed to allow for zeeman energy splitting in spin - triplet pairing states@xcite . in this case",
