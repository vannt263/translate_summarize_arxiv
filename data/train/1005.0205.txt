    "computing invariants of real quadratic fields , in particular the ideal class group and the regulator , has been of interest since the time of gauss , and today has a variety of applications . for example , solving the well - known pell equation is intimately linked to computing the regulator , and integer factorization algorithms have been developed that make use of this invariant .",
    "public - key cryptosystems have also been developed whose security is related to the presumed difficulty of these computational tasks .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the fastest algorithm for computing the ideal class group and regulator in practice is a variation of buchmann s index - calculus algorithm @xcite due to jacobson @xcite .",
    "the algorithm on which it is based has subexponential complexity in the size of the discriminant of the field .",
    "the version in @xcite includes several practical enhancements , including the use of self - initialized sieving to generate relations , a single large - prime variant ( based on that of buchmann and dllman @xcite in the case of imaginary quadratic fields ) , and a practical version of the required linear algebra .",
    "this approach proved to work well , enabling the computation of the ideal class group and regulator of a real quadratic field with a 101-decimal digit discriminant @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , both the complexity results of buchmann s algorithm and the correctness of the output are dependent on the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) .",
    "nevertheless , for fields with large discriminants , this approach is the only one that works .",
    "recently , biasse @xcite presented practical improvements to the corresponding algorithm for imaginary quadratic fields .",
    "these included a double large prime variant and improved algorithms for the required linear algebra .",
    "the resulting algorithm was indeed faster then the previous state - of - the - art @xcite , and enabled the computation of the ideal class group of an imaginary quadratic field with @xmath0 decimal digit discriminant .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a number of practical improvements to the index - calculus algorithm for computing the class group and regulator of a real quadratic field .",
    "in addition to adaptations of biasse s improvements in the imaginary case , we have found some modifications designed to improve the regulator computation part of the algorithm .",
    "we also investigate applying an idea of bernstein @xcite to factor residues produced by the sieve using a batch smoothness test .",
    "extensive computations demonstrating the effectiveness of our improvements are presented , including the computation of class group and regulator of a real quadratic field with @xmath0 decimal digit discriminant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly recall the required background of real quadratic fields , and give an overview of the index - calculus algorithm using self - initialized sieving .",
    "our improvements to the algorithm are described in section  [ sec : improvements ] , followed by numerical results in section  [ numerical ] .",
    "we present an overview of required concepts related to real quadratic fields and the index - calculus algorithm for computing invariants .",
    "for more details , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be the real quadratic field of discriminant @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a positive integer congruent to @xmath4 or @xmath5 modulo @xmath6 with @xmath3 or @xmath7 square - free .",
    "the integral closure of @xmath8 in @xmath9 , called the maximal order , is denoted by @xmath10 an interesting aspect of real quadratic fields is that their maximal orders contain infinitely many non - trivial units , i.e. , units that are not roots of unity .",
    "more precisely , the unit group of @xmath11 consists of an order @xmath12 torsion subgroup and an infinite cyclic group . the smallest unit greater than @xmath13 denoted by @xmath14",
    "is called the fundamental unit .",
    "the regulator of @xmath11 is defined as @xmath15    the fractional ideals of @xmath9 play an important role in the index - calculus algorithm described in this paper . in our setting ,",
    "a fractional ideal is a rank @xmath12 @xmath8-submodule of @xmath16 any fractional ideal can be represented as @xmath17 \\enspace,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 the integers @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are unique , and @xmath23 is defined modulo @xmath24 the ideal @xmath25 is said to be primitive if @xmath26 and @xmath27 is integral .",
    "the norm of @xmath25 is given by @xmath28    ideals can be multiplied using gauss s composition formulas for indefinite binary quadratic forms .",

    "@xmath34 it suffices to factor @xmath35 and , for each prime @xmath33 dividing the norm , determine whether the prime ideal @xmath36 or @xmath37 divides @xmath25 according to whether @xmath38 or @xmath39 modulo @xmath40    the ideal class group , denoted by @xmath41 is the factor group @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the subgroup of principal ideals .",
    "the class group is finite abelian , and its order is called the class number , denoted by @xmath44 by computing the class group we mean computing the elementary divisors @xmath45 with @xmath46 for @xmath47 such that @xmath48      like other index - calculus algorithms , the algorithm for computing the class group and regulator relies on finding certain smooth quantities , those whose prime divisors are all small in some sense . in the case of quadratic fields ,",
    "one searches for smooth principal ideals for which all prime ideal divisors have norm less than a given bound @xmath49 the set of prime ideals @xmath50 with @xmath51 is called the factor base .    a principal ideal @xmath52 with @xmath53 that factors completely over the factor base yields the relation @xmath54 the key to the index - calculus algorithm is the fact , proved by buchmann @xcite , that the set of all relations forms a sublattice @xmath55 of determinant @xmath56 provided that the prime ideals in the factor base generate @xmath57 this follows , in part , due to the fact that @xmath58 the integer component of @xmath59 is the kernel of the homomorphism from @xmath60 to @xmath61 given by @xmath62 for @xmath63 if @xmath64 generate @xmath41 then this homomorphism is surjective , and the homomorphism theorem then implies that @xmath65    the main idea behind the index - calculus algorithm is to find random relations until they generate the entire relation lattice @xmath66 let @xmath67 denote the sublattice of @xmath68 generated by the relations that have been computed . to determine whether @xmath69 one computes an approximation @xmath70 of @xmath56 such that @xmath71 the value @xmath70 is obtained by approximating the @xmath72-function @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the kronecker symbol @xmath75 and applying the analytic class number formula . if @xmath76 then @xmath77 is a integer multiple of @xmath78 thus , @xmath79 as soon as @xmath80 because @xmath56 is the only integer multiple of itself in the interval @xmath81    as described in @xcite , an adaptation of the strategy used in the self - initialized quadratic sieve ( siqs ) factoring algorithm is used to compute relations .",
    "first , compute the ideal @xmath82 $ ] with @xmath83 let @xmath84 with @xmath85 be an arbitrary element in @xmath86 then @xmath87 where @xmath88 because ideal norm is multiplicative , there exists an ideal @xmath89 with @xmath90 such that @xmath91 thus , finding @xmath92 and @xmath93 such that @xmath94 factors over the norms of the prime ideals in the factor base yields a relation .",
    "such @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be found by sieving the polynomial @xmath95 and a careful selection of the ideals @xmath25 yields a generalization of self - initialization , in which the coefficients of the sieving polynomials and their roots modulo the prime ideal norms can be computed quickly . in practice ,",
    "we use @xmath96 for sieving , so that the algorithm resembles the siqs more closely . for more details , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the determinant of the relation lattice @xmath67 is computed in two stages .",
    "the first step is to compute the determinant of the integer part of this sublattice by finding a basis in hermite normal form ( hnf ) .",
    "once @xmath67 has full rank , the determinant of this basis is computed as the product of the diagonal elements in a matrix representation of the basis vectors .",
    "the group structure is then computed by finding the smith normal form of this matrix .",
    "the real part of @xmath97 a multiple of the regulator @xmath98 is computed by first finding a basis of the kernel of the matrix consisting of the integer parts of the relations .",
    "every vector @xmath99 in the kernel corresponds to a multiple of the regulator computed with @xmath100 the `` real gcd '' of the multiples @xmath101 computed from each basis vector of the kernel , defined as @xmath102 is then the real part of @xmath103 an algorithm of maurer @xcite can be used to compute the real gcd efficiently and with guaranteed numerical accuracy given explicit representations of the @xmath104 and the kernel vectors .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the correctness of this algorithm depends on the truth of the generalized riemann hypothesis .",
    "in fact , the grh must be invoked in two places .",
    "the first is to compute a sufficiently accurate approximation @xmath70 of @xmath56 via a method due to bach @xcite . without the grh ,",
    "an exponential number of terms in the euler product used to approximate @xmath105 must be used ( see , for example , @xcite ) . the second is to ensure that the factor base generates @xmath57 without the grh , an exponential size factor base is required , whereas by a theorem of bach @xcite the prime ideals of norm less than @xmath106 suffice . in practice ,",
    "an even smaller factor base is often used , but in that case , the factor base must be verified by showing that every remaining prime ideal with norm less than bach s bound can be factored over the ideals in the factor base .",
    "in this section , we describe our practical improvements for computing the class group structure and the regulator of a the real quadratic field .",
    "some of these improvements , such as the double large prime variant and structured gaussian elimination , were used in @xcite for the simpler case of imaginary quadratic number fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the batch smoothness test and system solving based methods for computing the regulator had never been implemented in the context of number fields before .",
    "improving the relation collection phase allows us to speed up every other stage of the algorithm .",
    "indeed , the faster the relations are found , the smaller the factor base can be , thus reducing the dimensions of the relation matrix and the time taken by the linear algebra phase .",
    "in addition , the verification phase also relies on our ability to find relations and therefore benefits from improvements to the relation collection phase . throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", @xmath107 denotes the relation matrix , the matrix whose rows are the integer parts of the relations .",
    "the large prime variants were developed in the context of integer factorization to speed up the relation collection phase in both the quadratic sieve and the number field sieve .",
    "a single large prime variant was described by buchmann and dllman @xcite for computing the class group of an imaginary quadratic field , and adapted to the real case by jacobson @xcite .",
    "biasse @xcite described how the double large prime strategy could be using in the imaginary case , and obtained a significant speed - up .",
    "the idea is to keep relations involving one or two extra primes not in the factor base of norm less than @xmath108 .",
    "these relations thus have the form @xmath109 for @xmath110 in @xmath111 , and for @xmath112 of norm less than @xmath113 .",
    "we will refer to these types of partial relations as 1-partial relations and 2-partial relations , respectively .",
    "keeping partial relations only involving one large prime is the single large prime variant , whereas keeping those involving one or two is the double large prime variant which was first described by lenstra and manasse @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the case of more large primes , but it is a possibility that has been studied in the context of factorization @xcite .",
    "partial relations may be identified as follows .",
    "let @xmath114 be the remainder of @xmath96 after the division by all primes @xmath115 , and assume that @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath117 then we have a full relation .",
    "if @xmath118 then we have a 1-partial relation .",
    "we can see here that detecting 1-partial relations is almost for free .",
    "if we also intend to collect 2-partial relations then we have to consider the following possibilities :    1 .",
    "@xmath119 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath114 is prime and @xmath120 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath114 is prime and @xmath121 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath114 is composite and @xmath122 .    in cases 1 and 2",
    "we discard the relation . in case 3",
    "we have a 1-partial relation , and in case 4 we have @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "cases  1 , 2 , and 3 can be checked very easily , but if none are satisfied we need to factor @xmath114 in order to determine whether case  4 is satisfied .",
    "we used milan s implementation of the squfof algorithm @xcite based on the theoretical work of @xcite to factor the @xmath114 values produced .",
    "even though we might have to factor the remainder , partial relations are found much faster than full relations .",
    "however , the dimensions of the resulting matrix are much larger , thus preventing us from running the linear algebra phase directly on the resulting relation matrix . in addition",
    ", we have to find many more relations since we have to produce a full rank matrix .",
    "we will see in [ gauss ] how to reduce the dimensions of the relation matrix using gaussian elimination techniques .",
    "after detecting potential candidates for smooth integers via the siqs , one has to certify their smoothness . in @xcite ,",
    "this was done by trial division with the primes in the factor base . the time taken by trial division",
    "can be shortened by using bernstein s batch smoothness test @xcite , which uses a product tree structure and modular arithmetic to factor a batch of residues simultaneously in time @xmath126 where @xmath23 is the total number of input bits .",
    "instead of testing the smoothness of every potential candidate as soon as they are discovered , we rather stored them and tested them at the same time using bernstein s method as soon their number exceeded a certain limit .",
    "this improvement has an effect that is all the more important when the time spent in the trial division is long . in our algorithm",
    ", this time mostly depends on the tolerance value @xmath127 a parameter used to control the number of candidates yielded by the sieve for smoothness testing .      as mentioned in [ sieving ] , in order to determine whether the computed relations generate the entire relation lattice , we need to compute the hnf basis of the sublattice they generate .",
    "this can be done by putting the integer components of the relations as rows in a relation matrix , and computing the hnf .",
    "the first step when using large primes is to compute full relations from all of the partial relations .",
    "traditionally , rows were recombined to give full relations as follows . in the case of 1-partial relations , any pair of relations involving the same large prime @xmath128",
    "were recombined into a full relation . in the case of 2-partial relations ,",
    "lenstra @xcite described the construction of a graph whose vertices were the relations and whose edges linked vertices having one large prime in common .",
    "finding independent cycles in this graph allows us to recombine partial relations into full relations .    in this paper , we instead follow the approach of cavallar @xcite , developed for the number field sieve , and adapted by the first author to the computation of ideal class group structures in imaginary quadratic number fields @xcite , which uses gaussian elimination on columns .",
    "the ideas is to eliminate columns using structured gaussian strategies until the dimensions of the matrix are small enough to allow the computation of the hnf with standard algorithms .",
    "let us recall a few definitions .",
    "first , subtracting two rows is called _ merging_. if two relations corresponding to rows @xmath129 and @xmath130 share the same prime @xmath128 with coefficients @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively , then multiplying @xmath129 by @xmath132 and @xmath130 by @xmath131 and merging is called _",
    "pivoting_. finally , finding a sequence of pivots leading to the elimination of a column of hamming weight @xmath133 is a @xmath133-way merge .",
    "we aim to reduce the dimensions of the relation matrix by performing @xmath133-way merges on the columns of weight @xmath134 in increasing order for a certain bound @xmath135 . to limit the growth of the density and of the size of the coefficients induced by these operations , we used optimized pivoting strategies . in what follows",
    "we describe an algorithm performing @xmath133-way merges to minimize the growth of both the density and the size of the coefficients , thus allowing us to go deeper in the elimination process and delay the explosion of the coefficients .    as in @xcite",
    ", we define a cost function @xmath136 mapping rows onto the integers .",
    "the one used in @xcite satisfied @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are positive numbers , and @xmath140 $ ] is a row corresponding to @xmath141 .",
    "this way , the heaviest rows are those which have a high density and large coefficients . in our experiments for this work , we used a different cost function , see [ timings ] . then",
    ", to perform a @xmath133-way merge on a given column , we construct a complete graph @xmath142 of size @xmath133 such that    * the vertices are the rows @xmath143 and * every edge linking @xmath144 and @xmath145 has weight @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is obtained by pivoting @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "finding the best sequence of pivots with respect to the chosen cost function @xmath136 is equivalent to finding the minimum spanning tree @xmath148 of @xmath142 , and then recombining every row @xmath149 with its parent starting with the leaves of @xmath148 .    unlike in @xcite",
    ", we need to keep track of the permutations we apply to the relation matrix , and of the empty columns representing primes of norm less than @xmath150 .",
    "this will be required for the regulator computation part of the algorithm described next .      as mentioned in [ sieving ] ,",
    "the usual way to compute the regulator is to find a basis of the kernel of the relation matrix , compute integer multiples of the regulator from these basis vectors , and compute their real gcd using maurer s algorithm @xcite .",
    "if @xmath151 then either the class number or regulator computed is too large , and we need to find extra relations corresponding to new generators , and new kernel vectors involving them .    in this section , we describe a way of taking advantage of the large number of generators involved in the different partial relations .",
    "indeed , the dimensions of the relation matrix before the gaussian elimination stage is much larger than in the base scenario and thus involves more generators .",
    "consequently , given a set of @xmath152 kernel vectors @xmath153 , the probability that the corresponding elements @xmath154 where @xmath104 is the generator of the @xmath155-th relation , can be recombined into @xmath156 is much larger . on the other hand ,",
    "the dimensions of the matrix prevents us from running a kernel computation directly after the relation collection phase .",
    "thus , rather than attempting to compute the kernel , we use a method similar to that of vollmer @xcite based on solving linear systems .",
    "the first step of our algorithm consists of putting the matrix in a pseudo - lower triangular form using a permutation obtained during the gaussian elimination phase .",
    "indeed , as part of this computation we obtain a unimodular matrix @xmath157 such that @xmath158{c.c}{c.c }     \\begin{bmat}[2pt,1cm,1.5cm]{c}{c }       a      \\end{bmat } &       \\begin{bmat}[2pt,2cm,1.5cm]{c}{c }       ( 0 )      \\end{bmat } \\\\",

    ", we used the algorithm ` certsolveredlong ` from the iml library @xcite .",
    "it takes a single precision dense representation of @xmath163 and returns an lll - reduced solution .",
    "once @xmath107 is in pseudo - lower triangular form , we draw a set of relations @xmath164 which are not already rows of @xmath107 , and for each @xmath144 , @xmath165 , we solve the system @xmath166 we then augment @xmath107 with the rows @xmath144 for @xmath165 and the vectors @xmath167 with  @xmath22 extra coordinates , which are all set to zero except for the @xmath155-th which is set to  @xmath168 .",

    "in this section , we give numerical results showing the impact of our improvements . for each timing , we specify the architecture used . all the timings were obtained with our code in c++ based on the libraries gmp @xcite , ntl @xcite , iml @xcite and linbox @xcite .",
    "all timings are in cpu seconds .      the state of the art concerning class group and regulator computation was established in @xcite , where all the timings were obtained with the sparcstation ii architecture .",
    "in addition , most of the code used at the time is unavailable now , including the hnf computation algorithm .",
    "thus , providing a meaningful comparison between our methods and those of @xcite is difficult .",
    "we chose to implement the hnf computation algorithm in a way that resembles the one of @xcite , but takes advantage of the libraries available today for computing the determinant and the modular hnf .",
    "we used this implementation in each different scenario .",
    "the relation collection phase is easier to compare , since our method relies on siqs .    in the following",
    ", we will refer to the base case as the strategy consisting of finding the relation matrix without using the large prime variants or the smoothness batch test , and calculating the regulator by computing its kernel with the algorithm ` nullspacelong ` from iml library .",
    "it differs from the 0 large prime case ( 0lp ) where we use the algorithm described in [ kernel ] for computing the regulator , along with a relation collection phase that does not use large primes .",
    "we also denote the 1 large prime scenario by 1lp , the 2 large primes by 2lp and 2lp batch when using batch smoothness test .      in table",
    "[ tab : sieve ] , we give the time taken to collect all necessary relations . without large primes , we collected @xmath174 relations , whereas when we allow large primes we need to collect enough relations to ensure that the number of rows is larger than the number of non - empty columns .",
    "we used a 2.4 ghz opteron with 16 gb of memory and took @xmath175 with  @xmath176 . for each discriminant",
    ", we used the optimal parameters given in @xcite , including the size of the factor base , even if we tend to reduce this parameter when optimizing the overall time .",
    "the only parameter we modified is the tolerance value for the siqs , as a higher tolerance value is required for the large prime variations .",
    "in each case we took @xmath177 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the ratio @xmath178 does not have an important impact on the sieving time .",
    ".comparative table of the relation collection time [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     table [ overall : tab ] shows that there is an overall speed - up of of a factor of 2 for the smallest discriminants and 4 for the largest .",
    "the base case with the largest discriminants suffers from the necessity of finding some relations in a more randomized way .",
    "this ensures that we can get full rank submatrices of the relation matrix after the gaussian elimination to compute a small multiple of @xmath179 .",
    "matrices produced using the large prime variants do not need this extra step , even with the largest discriminants .",
    "this naturally affects the sieving time , since we can not use siqs for that purpose , but also affects phases relying on linear algebra .",
    "indeed , elimination produces a matrix with larger entries and dimensions .",
    "the improvements we described allow us to compute class groups and regulators of real number fields with larger discriminants than was previously possible .",
    "the key is to parallelize the relation collection and verification phase , while the linear algebra has to be performed the usual way .",
    "these methods were successfully used in @xcite to compute the class group structure of an imaginary quadratic field with a 110-digit discriminant .",
    "we used a cluster with 260 2.4ghz xeon cores to compute a relation matrix corresponding to the discriminant @xmath180 in 4 days .",
    "we allowed two large primes , used a tolerance value of 3.0 , tested batches of 100 residues , took @xmath181 and set @xmath182 .",
    "then , we used three 2.4 ghz opterons with 32 gb of memory each to compute determinants of full - rank submatrices of the relation matrix after the gaussian elimination in 1 day , and one 2.4ghz opteron to compute the hnf modulo the gcd of these determinants in 3 days .",
    "we had to find 4018 extra relations during the verification phase that took 4 days on 96 2.4ghz xeon cores .",
    "we thus obtained that @xmath183 and the corresponding regulator is @xmath184 we estimate that it would take two weeks ( 4000 relations per day ) to complete the relation collection for @xmath185 with the same factor base as @xmath186 , thus requiring a similar time for the linear algebra .",
    "recently , our work has been extended to the problems of principal ideal testing and solving the discrete logarithm problem in the ideal class group @xcite . the double large prime variant and improvements to relation generation translated directly to improvements in this context",
    ". however , hnf computations are not required for this problem , and linear system solving over @xmath8 can be used instead .",
    "the numerical results were used to give estimates for discriminant sizes that offer equivalent security to recommended sizes of rsa moduli .",
    "some possibilities for further improvements remain to be investigated .",
    "for example , a lattice sieving strategy could be used to sieve @xmath187 instead of @xmath188 factor refinement and coprime factorization techniques may be a useful alternative to bernstein s batch smoothness test .",
    "multiple large primes have been successfully used for integer factorization and could also be tried in our context .",
    "there is also still room for improvement to the linear algebra components .",
    "for example , a hnf algorithm that exploits the natural sparseness of the relation matrix , perhaps as a black - box algorithm , would be useful .",
    "if such an algorithm were available , we could reconsider using gaussian elimination techniques since they induce a densification of the matrix .",
    "we could also study the effect of other dense hnf algorithms in existing linear algebra packages such as kash , pari , sage and especially magma which seems to have the most efficient hnf algorithm for our types of matrices . in that case",
    ", we would need the elimination phase regardless of how these algorithms are affected by the density and the size of the coefficients of the matrix .",
    "indeed , we can not afford manipulating a dense representation of the matrix before the gaussian elimination phase .",
