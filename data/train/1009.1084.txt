    "magnetic fields play an important role in the study of astrophysical objects such as neutron stars , white dwarfs , pulsars , black holes and galaxy formation .",
    "in fact , several observations show that there are various scenarios where the magnetic fields and general relativity can not be neglected .",
    "one of them is the presence of strong magnetic fields in active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "these nuclei are known to produce more radiation than the rest of the entire galaxy and directly affect its structure and evolution .",
    "another scenario is the production of relativistic collimated jets in the inner regions of accretion discs , which can be explained considering magneto - centrifugal mechanisms @xcite . also , magnetic fields are important in understanding the interplay between magnetic and thermal processes for strongly magnetic neutron stars @xcite .",
    "at least 10% of all neutron stars are born as magnetars , with magnetic fields above @xmath0 g @xcite .",
    "analytical models that describe these astrophysical objects are often associated with solutions of einstein s equations @xcite . in the search for more realistic models for compact stellar systems ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor , the source of einstein s equations , is modified by introducing more complex terms that take into account additional physical properties as , for example , electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "stationary or static axially symmetric exact solutions to the einstein field equations representing relativistic thin disks are of great astrophysical importance since they can be used as models for certain galaxies , accretion disks , and the superposition of a black holes and a galaxy or an accretion disk as in the case of quasars .",
    "static thin disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite . also thin disks with radial tension",
    "were considered @xcite .",
    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static thin disks with or without radial pressure have been obtained by different authors @xcite .",
    "rotating thin disks that can be considered as a source of a kerr metric were presented by bick and ledvinka @xcite , while rotating disks with heat flow were were studied by gonzlez and letelier @xcite .",
    "disk sources for stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with electromagnetic fields , especially magnetic fields , are also of astrophysical importance in the study of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation .",
    "in such situation one has to study the coupled einstein - maxwell equations . thin disks in presence of electromagnetic field have been discussed as sources for kerr - newman fields @xcite , magnetostatic axisymmetric fields @xcite , conformastationary metrics @xcite , while models of electrovacuum static counterrotating dust disks were presented in @xcite .",
    "charged perfect fluid disks were also studied by vogt and letelier @xcite , and charged perfect fluid disks as sources of static and taub - nut - type spacetimes by garca - reyes and gonzlez @xcite .    in all the above cases ,",
    "the disks are obtained by an `` inverse problem '' approach , called by synge the `` _ g - method _ '' @xcite .",
    "the method works as follows : a solution of the vacuum einstein equations is taken , such that there is a discontinuity in the derivatives of the metric tensor on the plane of the disk , and the energy - momentum tensor is obtained from the einstein equations .",
    "the physical properties of the matter distribution are then studied by an analysis of the surface energy - momentum tensor so obtained .",
    "another approach to generate disks is by solving the einstein equations given a source ( energy - momentum tensor ) .",
    "essentially , they are obtained by solving a riemann - hilbert problem and are highly nontrivial @xcite .",
    "a review of this kind of disks solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations was presented by klein in @xcite .",
    "motion of matter near compact stars and black holes has been discussed widely in literature .",
    "the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic interaction is essential for characteristics of the motion , namely its stability properties .",
    "motivation for these studies arises from the problem of motion and acceleration of matter ( charged particles or dust grains ) @xcite .",
    "the study of the interaction between particles and electromagnetic fields in curved spacetimes is also of astrophysical interest , such is the case of strong synchrotron radiation emerging galactic cores , which can be explained admitting the existence in those regions of extended and very intense magnetic fields , interacting with ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "such magnetic fields could originate in the inner part of an accretion disc around the central black hole @xcite .",
    "also have been shown that the presence of a strong magnetic field provides the possibility of relativistic motion of counterrrotating matter @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we construct three families of general magnetostatic axisymmetric exact solutions of einstein - maxwell equations in spherical coordinates , prolate , and oblates .",
    "the zero order of this solutions were investigated previously in the ref .",
    "@xcite , and although the models of thin disks constructed there satisfied all the energy conditions , the solutions are not asymptotically flat .",
    "thus the solutions presented in this work are a generalization of solutions discussed in that reference , and , except the zero order , the new families of solutions are asymptotically flat but with total mass zero .",
    "hence , all discussed solutions with magnetic field are either singular , not asymptotically flat or massless .",
    "moreover , in all cases we build models of thin disk in which all the energy conditions are satisfied , which characterizes a matter distribution made of usual matter . in the case of oblates",
    "coordinates , the built solutions correspond to the magnetized version of the morgan - morgan vacuum solution @xcite .",
    "these solutions are interpreted as the exterior gravitational field of a finite dislike matter distribution immersed in a magnetic field , and thus can be used to model disklike astrophysical objects such as galaxies , accretion disks , and certain stars in presence of magnetic fields . however , unlike the part material or the electrostatic case , we show that the source of the magnetic field is not planar but of a different origin such as a remnants or fossil magnetic field @xcite , or can come from external sources , such as the presence of a nearby magnetars or neutron stars . on the other hand , even though realistic disklike sources have thickness , in first approximation these astrophysical objects can be considered to be very thin , e.g. , in our galaxy the radius of the disk is @xmath1 @xmath2 and its thickness is @xmath3 @xmath2 . in all cases we also construct relativistic models of infinite thin disks .",
    "we find for all the values of parameters that the surface energy density decreases rapidly which permits one can define a cut off radius and , in principle , to consider these disks as finite .",
    "in addition , we analyze the motion of charged test particles around these fields for circular equatorial orbits and we discuss the stability of this orbits against radial perturbations . for magnetized morgan - morgan fields",
    "we find that inside of disk the presence of magnetic field provides the possibility of to find relativist charged particles moving in both prograde and retrograde direction . even though this result can be seen as merely theoretical ,",
    "there are observational evidence of counterrotating matter components in certain types of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we make a review of the ernst s method in the case of a magnetostatic axisymmetric spacetime and we construct three families of solutions of einstein - maxwell equations in spherical coordinate , prolate and oblate , and then in generalized spheroidal coordinates which are a generalization of the previous cases .",
    "we also show explicitly some particular solutions among them a magnetized erez - rosen solution and magnetized morgan - morgan solution , and we analyze limiting cases .    in section iii",
    "we present a summary of the procedure to obtain models of thin disks with a purely azimuthal pressure and currents for the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "in particular , we obtain expressions for the surface energy - momentum tensor and the surface current density of the disks . in the case of the magnetized morgan - morgan solutions ,",
    "these are interpreted as the exterior gravitational field of a finite dislike source immersed in a magnetic field .",
    "then we construct using the well known `` displace , cut and reflect '' method exact solutions representing relativistic thin disks of infinite extension .    in section",
    "iv we study for some particular solutions the equatorial circular motion of charged test particles and we also discuss their stability against radial perturbation using an extension of rayleigh criteria of stability @xcite .",
    "in particular we analyze the circular velocity and the specific angular momentum of the particles . in order to compare the behavior of these physical quantities with other known magnetized solutions",
    ", we also study the electrogeodesic motion of test particles and their stability for a kerr - type solution or magnetic dipole solution @xcite .",
    "finally , in section v we summarize and discuss the results obtained .",
