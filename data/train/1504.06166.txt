    "during solar eruptions , charged particles are accelerated up to relativistic energies , to form the solar energetic particle ( sep ) population of the cosmic rays observed by in situ instruments at different locations in the heliosphere .",
    "the particles are believed to be accelerated in flares and cme - driven shock waves @xcite",
    ". however , the relative importance of the flare and cme processes on the origin of the observed sep populations is still under scientific discussion , and opinions differ on how the eruption phenomena and the sep production are connected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the difficulty in deducing the particle acceleration scenarios during solar eruptions stems from the nature of sep observations .",
    "the propagation of the charged seps is affected by the interplanetary magnetic field .",
    "the seps are guided by the large - scale archimedean spiral structure of the interplanetary magnetic field , the parker spiral .",
    "solar wind is turbulent , and the particles scatter off the inhomogeneities of the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the particle propagation is diffusive rather than direct propagation from the acceleration site to the in - situ particle detectors , typically at 1  au from the sun . in order to understand the connections between the components of a solar eruption and the observed sep intensities",
    ", we must understand the propagation of seps in the interplanetary space , and deconvolve it from the observations .",
    "this has been done for several sep events ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "deconvolving of the interplanetary transport from the in - situ sep observations is , however , not simple , and is usually performed only in case studies . for larger statistical studies ,",
    "simpler methods to obtain the injection time of the seps are commonly used .",
    "the popular choice is to use the velocity dispersion analysis ( vda ) , where the first - observed particles are assumed to have propagated without scattering ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the possible uncertainties on the arrival times of first particles caused by interplanetary transport effects are typically not evaluated in these studies .",
    "the validity of the vda method has been studied by using numerical sep simulations that solve the focused transport equation describing particle propagation in interplanetary space . by using onset times at 1  au obtained from simulated sep time - intensity profiles at different energies",
    ", it has been shown that for strong scattering conditions the vda can result in large errors for the injection times and path lengths of the particles @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , defined the onset time relative to the maximum intensity ( e.g. , the time when the intensity reaches 1% of the maximum intensity ) , which is not the common practice when analysing real sep events . unlike in simulated sep events ,",
    "real events may have a complex structure , due to local interplanetary magnetic field structures and multiple , energy - dependent injection components ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this may affect the time profile of the event before the maximum intensity is reached .",
    "thus , to get the best estimate of the beginning of the injection , the onset of an sep event is typically determined by using the moment when the sep intensity exceeds the pre - event background by a statistically significant amount ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite analysed simulated sep events with vda by adding a pre - event background to the time - intensity evolution of the sep event , and using the background - exceeding time as the event onset time .",
    "they found that the errors in vda have strong dependence on the pre - event and event maximum spectra .",
    "in this work , we build on the results of @xcite and discuss the complexity of the effect of the pre - event background and the role of scattering in different types of sep events , and show how different event types can result in very different vda results .",
    "we study the sep time - intensity profile of energetic protons at the time of the observed onset , and derive a simple estimation for the delay the particles experience due to the scattering in interplanetary space .",
    "we show that this delay estimate can successfully be used as a correction to the observed onset times to improve the accuracy of the vda .",
    "we apply the correction and its error limits to simulated sep events and the sep event of june 10 2000 , and show that the method improves the deduced injection time in both cases .",
    "to clarify the used terminology , we use the term `` _ _ injection time _ _ '' to describe the time of release of seps at or near the sun , `` _ _ onset time _ _ '' to describe the time when the sep intensities are observed to rise at 1 au ( see discussion below ) , and `` _ _ launch time _ _ '' as the time when a cme is estimated to lift off .",
    "furthermore , the symbol @xmath0 refers to the injection time obtained by vda , and @xmath1 , the onset time obtained from the simulated events . the time required for a scatter - free particle with velocity @xmath2 to propagate distance @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 ,",
    "is referred to as `` _ _ scatter - free time _ _ '' .",
    "in this work , we study the effect of pre - event background on sep injection times as determined by the vda method , in the presence of interplanetary scattering and different injection profiles .",
    "we solve the focused transport equation of energetic protons , @xmath5 with @xmath6 the particle distribution function , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the speed , pitch angle cosine , position along field line and time , respectively , @xmath10 the focusing length , @xmath11 the scattering frequency , and @xmath12 describing the particle source .",
    "the equation is solved using monte carlo simulations , where test - particles are propagated and focused along the parker spiral in a frame co - rotating with the sun , and scattered isotropically in pitch angle , with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the parallel scattering mean free path ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "adiabatic deceleration is taken into account by scattering the particles in the co - rotating solar wind frame .",
    "propagation of paricles across the parker spiral direction is not considered .",
    "we use the initial energy range from 1  to 120  mev with a power law spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "this power law is used for all runs , to reduce the parameter space .",
    "the particles are injected at 0.01  au , at time @xmath16 , with a reflecting boundary at the sun , and followed for 48  hours .",
    "the parker spiral is parametrised by a constant solar wind velocity of 400  km / s and solar rotation period of 25.35 days , resulting in parker spiral length of 1.17  au .",
    "we use constant radial mean free path , with values @xmath17  au at 1gv rigidity to represent moderate scattering conditions , and 1  au at 1  gv rigidity to represent weak scattering conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mean free path is taken to depend on the particle rigidity , as @xmath18 , consistent with quasilinear theory for kolmogorov slab spectrum @xcite and observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the monte carlo simulations are used to obtain a response , as observed at 1  au , for an impulsive injection of protons , at 20 logarithmically spaced energy channels between 1  and 100  mev .",
    "the upper limit of the channels is chosen to be 100  mev rather than 120  mev , because particles experience adiabatic deceleration . in order to mimic more realistic particle release scenarios , we convolve the impulsive responses with two injection profiles at the sun : a _ fast injection _ model , with 30 minutes of linear increase of injection strength , followed by 570 minutes of linear decay ; and a _ slow injection _ model , with 570 minutes of linear increase , followed with 30 minutes of linear decay . these profiles were selected because cme - related sep acceleration has been estimated to be most efficient when the cme is at 515  r@xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a cme with velocity 2000  km / s reaches 5  r@xmath19 in half an hour , corresponding to our fast injection model .",
    "the slow injection model accounts for slower cmes , higher maximum injection heights , poor connection between the spacecraft and acceleration region and possible cross - field transport of seps , that may cause a gradual injection of particles .    , where the event maximum intensity is an order of magnitude times the background intensity .",
    "the event maximum spectrum power law index is  3 , and the background power law index  1.[fig : spectra ] ]    we define our study parameters using sep intensities that can be observed directly at 1  au .",
    "we scale the convolved time - intensity profiles of simulated seps at 1  au so that the spectrum calculated from the maxima of the scaled intensities at each channel forms a power law , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sep event maximum intensity at energy @xmath22  mev , and @xmath23 the power law index of the spectrum .",
    "the resulting event time - intensity profiles are overlaid on a constant pre - event background , which also follows a power law energy spectrum , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background intensity at @xmath26 and @xmath27 the background power law index .",
    "an example of the spectra is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion analysis is based on the assumptions that the first particles observed at a given distance from the sun have been released simultaneously , propagate the same path length , and experience no scattering or energy changes .",
    "under these conditions , the arrival time , @xmath28 , of the particles to the observer at distance @xmath3 along the magnetic field line is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the particles injection time at the sun , @xmath3 the travelled distance and @xmath2 the particle velocity .",
    "thus , knowing the observed onset times at 1  au , and the velocities of the particles , a simple linear fitting of this data according to the eq .",
    "( [ eq : vda ] ) gives the particles injection time at the sun , and the path length traveled by the particles .",
    "in the simulated events , the injection of the particles starts at @xmath16 , thus a successful vda fit would give @xmath31 and @xmath32  au .",
    "while all of the vda assumptions can be questioned , in this study we concentrate only on the effect of the scattering on the derived injection time and path length .",
    "in particular , we will study the common practice of defining sep onset as the moment the intensity is discernible from the pre - event background , and how this practice affects the vda results .",
    "the sep event onset time , observed by particle detectors , is often difficult to determine due to low counting rate of particles of the ambient energetic particle population before and at the very beginning of the event . to determine the onset time , typically a threshold of one or several standard deviations above the pre - event background is used to define the onset in a statistically significant way",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for an alternative method ) .",
    "this results in a delay for the observed onset . in order to mimic this effect",
    ", we define the onset to be observed when the intensity at 1  au rises 10% above the pre - event background .",

    "the onset times of the intensity increases are shown by symbols , with the brown thick curve crossing the time - intensity curves on the left showing the theoretical time of arrival of particles in the case of particles following the assumed 1.17  au parker spiral field without scattering .",
    "as can be seen , the intensity increase begins significantly later than the scatter - free time at all energy channels .",
    "the effect of the delay on the vda can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : binvexample ] , where we show the onset time plotted against @xmath36 ( the red and green symbols ) . as can be seen ,",
    "the onset times are clearly delayed from the velocity dispersion pattern for particles that are observed immediately after scatter - free propagation to 1.17  au ( dashed blue line ) . in addition ,",
    "not all observed onsets follow the linear velocity dispersion pattern . in our example",
    "event , at large energies the arrival time dependence on @xmath36 is inverted , with onsets at higher energeies observed later than at lower energies , due to the pre - event background .",
    "such energy channels clearly must be excluded from the velocity dispersion fit . in order to achieve this ,",
    "we have excluded energy channels where @xmath37 ( the green curves and small symbols in figs .",
    "[ fig : eventexample ] and  [ fig : binvexample ] ) .",
    "however , even after removing the non - linearly behaving energy channels from the velocity dispersion fit , the pre - event background and scattering still have a substantial effect on the determination of the sep injection time .",
    "the observed onset time at different energy channels is delayed by 2040 minutes from the scatter - free arrival time .",
    "the vda - fitted injection time for this event is 21 minutes later than the actual release time of particles at the sun .",
    "the path length , 1.26  au , is clearly longer than the nominal 1.17  au parker spiral length in our model .",
    "the increased path length is due to the low - energy ( high @xmath36 ) particles having longer delay relative to the scatter - free arrival time ( blue dashed line in fig .  [",

    "this type of event may be observed when the pre - event background is not affected by preceding sep events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in such an event , the intensities at higher energies are masked more efficiently by the pre - event background than at lower energies . as can be seen , the vda path lengths are typically close to or slightly longer than the nominal parker spiral length , with the obtained injection time considerably later than the actual solar injection time .    in the event shown in the middle panels , the pre - event and event maximum spectral indices are equal .",
    "this can take place for example when a soft - spectrum sep event follows a harder - spectrum sep event .",
    "the delay with respect to the scatter - free arrival time is significantly larger at low energies .",
    "this results in a significantly longer path length , of 1.52 au in the case of fast injection model ( left middle panel ) , and 1.75  au for the slow injection model ( right middle panel ) .",
    "the long path length , however , compensates partly the delay caused by scattering , resulting in only 2-minute error for the injection time determination with the fast injection model .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] depict an event where a hard sep event takes place on a soft pre - event background .",
    "this typically takes place when a previous sep event is still decaying at the time of a new sep event . in this case , the lower energies are efficiently masked by the pre - event background , and the velocity dispersion fit results in a very long path length . as can be seen in both the fast and slow injection models ( bottom left and right panels , respectively ) , the obtained injection time can precede the real injection time in such cases .    fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] shows that also the injection profile of the particles has a significant effect on the vda results , with the comparison of fast and slow injection profiles on the left and right columns , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the effect of the pre - event and event maximum spectral shapes on the velocity dispersion pattern is similar for both injection models .",
    "however , the delay times for individual energy channels are longer in the slow injection case , and the resulting error in injection time is also larger .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , the assumption of scatter - free propagation can result in significant systematic errors for the sep injection time and the traversed path length .",
    "this error is caused by the delay of particles due to interplanetary scattering , which should be taken into account in the velocity dispersion analysis as @xmath38 the estimation of the delay time @xmath39 is not trivial , as it depends on scattering conditions , injection profile and the level of the pre - event background relative to the sep event intensity .",
    "also the estimation of the resulting error in vda is not straigthforward : as shown in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , an error in the path length can compensate the error in the injection time determination .",
    "such a complicated relation between the observed velocity dispersion and the injection is difficult to analyse , and may skew the results of large statistical sep studies , where fitting of the transport of seps is not feasible .",
    "the rise time of sep intensities above the pre - event background is not the only observable of an sep event onset . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eventexample ] , the intensities rise initially roughly exponentially , with different rise rates at different energies and intensities . this gradual rise , as opposed to immediate rise to the maximum intensity , is a result of the particle scattering in interplanetary space . in the following",

    "however , as there are no analytic descriptions for the initial phase for diffusively spreading particles , we will use diffusion as a starting point of our study .",

    "[ fig : fits ] : if the path length is nominal , as in the top panels , all of the fitted energies will have almost equal delay time @xmath39 , which results in a large error for the injection time . if , on the other hand , the path length is long , the delay time is shorter at higher energies ( smaller @xmath36 ) , and the vda - fitted curve converges towards the scatter - free vda pattern ( middle panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : fits ] ) at the limit of @xmath80 , and the resulting error in the vda injection time is small .",
    "this can take place in particular when the spectral indices of the pre - event background and event maximum spectra are similar . in this case",
    "the ratio of maximum and background intensities is independent of energy , and the vda result is similar to the method used by @xcite and @xcite , who determine the onset time as the time when a fixed fraction of maximum intensity at the energy channel is reached .    it should be remembered that also factors other than the parallel scattering may influence the particle propagation in the interplanetary space .",
    "recent multi - spacecraft analyses of sep events suggest that sep events have a wide extent in heliographic longitudes @xcite . while the large longitudinal spread of particles may be caused by processes low in the corona ( see , e.g. ,",
    "* for discussion ) , the observed longitudinal dependence of anisotropy suggests that significant interplanetary cross - field transport is taking place @xcite .",
    "while cross - field diffusion has traditionally been suggested to transport seps across the mean field also other mechanisms , such as large - scale drifts @xcite and propagation along meandering field lines @xcite have received recent attention .",
    "each of the suggested mechanisms would result in different type of interplanetary transport , which may be seen in the velocity dispersion pattern .",
    "however , without taking the diffusion in the interplanetary medium into account in any way , it may be difficult to discern between the different mechanisms . in this work",
    ", we derived an estimate for the delay time of seps due to the scattering , using a simple model for the onset evolution , and sep transport simulations .",
    "we showed that the estimate improved the vda fitting results in the case where particles propagate along the parker spiral field .",
    "we tested the model by analysing a solar event that could be assumed to be magnetically well connected from the sun to earth and found that the correction brought both the injection time and path length to be consistent with the expected solar and interplanetary conditions .",
    "a comparison of our model results against multi - spacecraft observations , as well as events modelled with cross - field diffusion , drifts and meandering fieldlines , may bring more light into the mechanism behind the efficient spreading of seps in the inner heliosphere .",
    "in this work , we have studied the validity of the velocity dispersion method in estimating the injection times of seps by using simulations of energetic protons .",
    "we find that the typical method of determining the onset time as time when the intensity of the seps exceeds the pre - event background in statistically significant amount can lead to significant errors when estimating the solar injection time and path length with the vda method .",
    "it is important to note that a reasonable path length does not imply a good estimate for the injection time .",
    "we studied the use of the intensity increase timescale , @xmath48 to improve the vda estimate .",
    "the gradual increase of the sep intensities in time is caused by the scattering of the seps in the interplanetary space , and we find a relation between @xmath48 , the diffusion timescale @xmath72 and the delay of the seps with respect to the scatter - free propagation time of the particles from sun to the earth . using this relation , we showed that the injection time estimate given by the vda can be improved in case of magnetically well - connected sep events .",
    "we conclude that the injection times and path lengths obtained by using the vda method should be used with care .",
    "the interplanetary scattering of particles does delay the arrival of the first - observed seps .",
    "this delay is likely to cause errors in injection analysis based on the observed sep onset times particularly if the pre - event particle intensities are high compared to the event maximum intensity .",
    "while our analysis was performed using energetic protons , our results are valid for any particle species that are affected by interplanetary scattering , including heavy ions and electrons ."
