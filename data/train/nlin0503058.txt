    "when a quantum system is known to have a chaotic classical limit , the simplest description of its eigenvalues , eigenstates , and dynamics is given by the universal predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite and the closely related random wave hypothesis  @xcite . recently , however , there has been increased interest in understanding the deviations from rmt that are quite sizable in many systems of interest and are often due to short - time dynamical effects .",
    "rmt assumes implicitly that under time evolution , any initial state immediately spreads randomly over the entire available hilbert space ; any realistic chaotic dynamics , however , maintains at short times information about the initial state and only after some finite mixing time @xmath0 does the dynamics become truly random .",
    "for the purpose of describing spectral statistics , such as the distribution of level spacings , the above consideration may easily be taken into account by noting that rmt predictions are valid only inside energy windows of size less than a ballistic thouless energy @xmath1 .",
    "the situation with wave functions is not so simple , as short - time dynamical effects can lead to large deviations from rmt not only for energy - averaged quasimodes but also for individual eigenstates .",
    "any short unstable periodic orbit is one obvious example of a non - random dynamical feature that is known to cause significant deviations from rmt statistics in the eigenstates .",
    "it has been shown that the  scarring \" of individual wave functions by a typical periodic orbit is an @xmath2 effect that persists in the semiclassical limit , as measured by the distribution of wave function intensities on the periodic orbit in husimi phase space  @xcite . using a linearization of the dynamics around the specific orbit",
    ", the distribution of quantum intensities on or near the orbit may be obtained semiclassically as a function of the classical monodromy matrix , and various moments of the distribution , such as the inverse participation ratio , may be expressed analytically  @xcite .",
    "the scarring effect has been studied experimentally and numerically in a wide variety of systems  @xcite , and may have consequences for the conductance through a resonant tunneling diode or a ballistic quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "the imprint of short - time dynamics on eigenstate structure is not limited to situations where the short - time dynamics is related to classical unstable periodic orbits .",
    "for example , scar - like resonances related to diffractive trajectories have been observed in a 2deg conductance experiment  @xcite .",
    "the approach of using short - time behavior to understand eigenstate structure and statistics has been used successfully in many situations where a proper classical limit does not exist , such as two - body random interactions in a many - fermion system  @xcite or dynamics on a quantum graph or lattice  @xcite , as well as in pseudo - integrable systems where the lyapunov exponent vanishes  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , short - time dynamical information necessarily implies deviations from rmt not only for individual wave function intensities , but also for spatial or phase space correlations  @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to discuss a systematic , general , and efficient framework for studying the constraints that short - time correlations impose on the eigenstate structure , regardless of whether such short - time correlations can be computed semiclassically .",
    "we allow ourselves to focus on one or an arbitrary number of initial wave packets , and the calculations may be performed equally well in closed or open systems , as there is no assumption of unitarity in the dynamics .",
    "we explicitly allow for the presence of errors in the short - time correlations , and demonstrate the stability of the results with respect to such errors .    in the context of extracting stationary properties from a time - domain correlation function",
    ", we mention the important work that has been done by mandelshtam and coworkers using the  filter diagonalization \" method  @xcite . in that approach ,",
    "one typically begins with a single wave packet , and spectral information can in principle be computed _ exactly _ when the correlation function is known for at least @xmath3 times , where @xmath3 is the hilbert space dimension . in the bootstrapping approach ,",
    "we use multiple initial wave packets , and we do not assume exact finite - dimensionality of the hilbert space . thus our goal is not an exact solution of the spectral analysis problem , but rather an increasingly good approximation as the amount of input data increases .",
    "of course , exact solutions are not possible in any case in the presence of noise or numerical instability , so in practice regularization must be performed , yielding comparable results for the two approaches .",
    "one advantage of the bootstrapping approach is that the linear algebra involved requires @xmath4 matrices only , where @xmath5 is the number of initial wave packets , allowing the problem to scale very well computationally for large system sizes and long times .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ secsum ] .",
    "we begin by considering a set of @xmath5 wave packets @xmath6 , for simplicity taking the wave packets to be orthonormal ( but not a complete set ) . in practice",
    ", the choice of @xmath6 will be dictated by the physics of interest .",
    "for example , the @xmath6 may be chosen as position eigenstates if we are interested in position - space wave function structure , or momentum eigenstates for scattering behavior , or gaussian wave packets for analyzing the effects of classical periodic orbits . in a many - body problem ,",
    "the @xmath6 may usefully be taken as the non - interacting product states .",
    "the quantity of interest in the time domain is the correlation function @xmath7 whose diagonal elements @xmath8 constitute the autocorrelation functions for the individual wave packets .",

    "the @xmath15matrix is defined directly in the energy domain whereas we begin our analysis in the time domain and transform to the energy domain later on .",
    "the decomposition used here also resembles somewhat the one used in the quantitative analysis of periodic orbit scarring  @xcite , where it is helpful to separate terms in the return amplitude that are associated with paths staying on the periodic orbit from terms associated with homoclinic paths that leave the orbit once and first return at some later time . of course ,",
    "in the case we consider here the @xmath16dimensional subspace spanned by the wave packets @xmath6 will not in general have any connection with a particular classical structure such as a periodic orbit or surface of section .",
    "instead the choice of @xmath6 is governed either by our exact or approximate knowledge of the correlation function for those initial and final states or by an interest in extracting wave function structure information in a specific basis or phase space region .",
    "furthermore , no semiclassical approximation is implicit in the method we develop here , although we will see below that the approach can be extended to situations where the correlation function information used as input is only approximate , as would be the case for example when a semiclassical propagator is used .",

    "we note also that , in the case of scar theory , little or no benefit is gained by following several wave packets launched along the same weakly unstable periodic orbit , since they all exhibit very similar time evolution , and share nearly identical local density of states  @xcite . from a bootstrapping perspective , we may consider two wave packets nearly related by time evolution , e.g. , @xmath163 .",
