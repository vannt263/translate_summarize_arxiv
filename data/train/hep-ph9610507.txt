    "despite great experimental efforts , the tau - neutrino still remains as the only one which can have mass in the mev range .",
    "the present experimental limit on its mass is @xcite : m _ _ < 23 [ mlab ] further progress will have to wait for the improvements expected at future tau - charm or b factories @xcite . on the other hand , many particle physics models of massive neutrinos lead to a tau neutrino with mass in the mev range @xcite .",
    "moreover such a neutrino may have interesting cosmological implications @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine critically the cosmological constraints .",
    "the first comes from the critical density argument @xcite .",
    "however , as has been widely illustrated with many particle physics models where neutrinos acquire their mass by the spontaneous violation of a global lepton number symmetry @xcite , this limit can be avoided due to the existence of fast decays @xcite and/or annihilations @xcite into majorons .",
    "although the majoron was first introduced in the context of the seesaw model @xcite the spontaneous breaking of lepton number can be realized in many different models .",
    "there is only one important constraint on its properties following from the precision measurements of the invisible z width at lep , namely the majoron must be mostly singlet under the 1 symmetry .",
    "it has been noted that , in many models of this type the relic number density can be depleted well below the required value for all masses obeying .    in order to demonstrate the cosmological viability of the mev tau neutrino we must also consider the restrictions that follow from primordial nucleosynthesis considerations @xcite . in the standard model ,",
    "these rule out @xmath14 masses in the range @xcite : 0.5 < m _ _",
    "< 35 [ mns ] this would imply that @xmath15 mev is the nucleosynthesis limit for the case of a majorana tau neutrino .",
    "here we will only assume that is a majorana particle , which is the most likely possibility .",
    "this assumes for the maximum allowed effective number of extra neutrino species @xmath16 during nucleosynthesis either 0.4 or 0.6 .",
    "recent contradictory data on the primordial deuterium abundance @xcite may cast some doubts on the validity of this assumption ( for recent analysis see refs .",
    "in particular , if @xmath17 is allowed @xcite , there may be an open window for neutrino mass somewhere near 20 mev",
    ". however it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this window actually does not exist , when one carefully takes into account the influence of non - equilibrium electronic neutrinos on the neutron - to - proton ratio",
    ". these neutrinos would come from massive @xmath14 annihilations @xmath18 .",
    "however one knows that new interactions capable of depleting mev density in the cosmic plasma are needed , at some level , in order to comply with the limit on the relic neutrino density .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to analyse their possible effect in relation with the primordial nucleosynthesis constraints @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the effect of neutrinos with large annihilation cross sections into majorons . in order to compute the relevant annihilation rates",
    "we must parametrize the majoron interactions .",
    "these arise from the diagrams shown in .",
    "the t - channel diagram is present in all majoron models , while the strength of the s - channel scalar exchange diagram is somewhat model - dependent .",
    "one way of writing the couplings of majorons to neutrinos is using the fact that the majorons are nambu - goldstone bosons and hence have derivative couplings .",
    "this is the so called _ polar coordinate _ method .",
    "the other method is to use a pseudoscalar interaction , sometimes refered to as the _ cartesian method_. the two methods are equivalent , even for second order processes as we are considering here , if we include _ all _ the feynman diagrams contributing at that order to the process of interest @xmath19 j j. in our calculations throughout this paper we will use the cartesian method of parametrizing the majoron interactions . though we must in principle include also the s - channel diagram in , we will neglect this contribution .",
    "we explicitly show in the appendix , that it is justified in our case to use only the t - channel contribution in order to derive a _ conservative _ limit on neutrino mass @xmath20 and majoron coupling @xmath1 .",
    "we have determined the restrictions imposed by primordial nucleosynthesis upon such a heavy tau neutrino in the presence of annihilations into majorons .",

    "we also show how such @xmath1 values are theoretically plausible in the context of the most attractive elementary particle physics models where mev tau neutrinos arise , and which are based upon the spontaneous violation of lepton number .",
    "massive tau neutrinos certainly interact with leptons via the standard weak interactions , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , as assumed in refs .",

    "this corresponds , in the usual four - component notation to = i g j _ _ 5 _ [ lagint ] the corresponding elastic processes do not change particle densities , but as long as they are effective they maintain all species with the same temperature .",
    "we now comment on the cosmological bound provided by the critical density argument @xcite . in order to be consistent with cosmological limits ,",
    "the relic abundance of the heavy majorana tau neutrinos must be suppressed over and above what is provided by the standard model charged and neutral current weak interactions , as well as those derived from .",
    "this happens automatically in many majoron models , where neutrinos decay with lifetimes shorter than required by the critical density constraint @xcite .",
    "for example , in majoron models of the seesaw - type a massive @xmath14 will typically decay with lifetimes shorter than the one required in order to obey the critical density bound , but longer than the relevant nucleosynthesis time , as illustrated in figure 18 of ref .",
    "another example is provided by the model of ref .",
    "a lifetime estimate was given for this model in fig .",
    "it is seen explicitly that a of mass in the mev range of interest to us is expected to be stable on the nucleosynthesis time scale , but decays with lifetimes shorter than required by the critical density bound .",

    ". however we assume that the weak and electromagnetic interactions are effective enough to keep @xmath49 s and @xmath51 s densities in their equilibrium values , @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "thus we are left with a system of just two coupled boltzmann equations : @xmath54 @xmath55 now let us briefly describe our calculations .",

    "note that in the standard @xmath101 case we agree with the previous results of ref . @xcite but get somewhat larger values than those obtained in ref .",
    "we ascribe this small discrepancy to the use , in ref.@xcite of an approximate expression for the energies , rather than the exact ones .",

    "in reality , the true value of @xmath106 is always larger than its frozen value , and we have taken this into account in order to obtain reliable limits in the low mass region .    in order to derive the nucleosynthesis limits , first we developed a simple code for the numerical calculation of the neutron fraction @xmath107 , as presented e.g. in ref .",

    "then we incorporated @xmath108 to this numerical code and performed the integration of the neutron - proton kinetic equations for each pair of @xmath102 values , where @xmath1 is the coupling constant which determines the strength of the annihilation cross section . comparing @xmath109 with @xmath110 at @xmath111 mev ( the moment when practically all neutrons are wound up in @xmath112he )",

    "we have found that both methods are in good agreement .",
    "the results for the numerical calculations of the equivalent number of massless neutrinos during nucleosynthesis with the use of kawano s numerical code are shown in figure [ neffm ] .",
    "for comparison the case of @xmath101 is shown ( dashed line ) . from figure [ neffm ]",
    "one can see that , in the asymptotic limit of very large the annihilation into majorons is very inefficient ( see ) , so that the effective @xmath0 value is larger than in the standard @xmath101 case precisely by a factor @xmath113 , which corresponds to the extra majoron degree of freedom .",
    "thus , if we take also @xmath1 very large we get just @xmath114 .",
    "of course this asymptotic limit is already experimentally ruled out by the aleph mass limit @xcite and thus is not displayed . for values in the range from 10 to 23 mev or so ,",
    "@xmath0 can be made acceptable , provided g is raised sufficiently . for the intermediate mass region , 1 - 10 mev , and @xmath115 the model may even give @xmath3 , which is possibly supported by some of the observational data .",
    "finally , in the small mass limit the energy density of is roughly the same as that of the massless or , so that all @xmath1 values shown in the figure lead to the same asymptotic value @xmath116 , corresponding to the three massless neutrinos plus majoron ( instead of @xmath117 for a very heavy ) .",
    "however , it might be that observations eventually could lead to a tighter limit @xmath118 . in such event",
    "a simple way out is to have the majoron out - of - equilibrium , which would require a very small @xmath1 value , @xmath119 , so that the production of majorons through annihilations of s would be negligible .",
    "should the observations eventually lead to an even tighter limit @xmath120 the situation is qualitatively different , as it would raise a conflict with the standard model . a possible way to lower @xmath0 below three provided by our model is to have a massive in the mev range and with a relatively strong coupling with majorons .",
    "indeed , one can see from figure [ neffm ] that , while it is not possible in the standard model to account for @xmath120 , it is quite natural in our model to have @xmath120 for a wide range of intermediate tau neutrino masses and reasonable large values of the coupling constants @xmath1 .    in summary",
    ", one sees that all masses below 23 mev are allowed by the nucleosynthesis condition @xmath121 if @xmath122 , provided that the coupling between @xmath14 s and @xmath78 s exceeds a value of a few times @xmath123 .",
    "this situation seems at the moment compatible with the experimental data , at least the @xmath112he and @xmath124li determinations @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to express the above results in the @xmath125 plane , as shown in figure [ neffmg ] .",
    "the region above each curve is allowed for the corresponding @xmath126 .",
    "there has been a variety of majoron models proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "they are attractive extensions of the standard electroweak model where neutrinos acquire mass by virtue of the spontaneous violation of a global lepton number symmetry . apart from their phenomenological interest as extensions of the lepton and/or higgs sectors of the standard model @xcite , majoron models offer the possibility of loosening the cosmological limits on neutrino masses ,",
    "either because neutrinos decay or because they annihilate to majorons .",
    "the first and most obvious of these is the limit that follows from the cosmological density argument @xcite .",
    "as we saw in the previous section one can also place limits on a heavy tau neutrino with mass in the mev range by using primordial element abundances .",
    "we have determined the restrictions imposed by primordial nucleosynthesis upon a heavy tau neutrino , in the presence of annihilations into majorons .",
    "our results are completely general and may be compared to any bound characterized by an allowed value of @xmath126 . given any @xmath126 value one can readily obtain the allowed regions of and the majoron coupling constant @xmath1 as shown in . as an example , a recent model - independent likelihood analysis of big bang nucleosynthesis based on @xmath112he and @xmath124li determinations has claimed an upper limit @xmath127 ( at 95% c.l . )",
    "@xcite . from this",
    "would imply that all masses are allowed , as long as @xmath1 exceeds @xmath123 or so .",
    "however we believe that , in the present state of affairs , one should probably not assign a statistical confidence to nucleosynthesis results , to the extent that these are still dominated by systematic , rather than statistical errors .",
    "strictly speaking , what really displays is the equivalent neutrino number @xmath0 for various combinations of ( , @xmath1 ) parameters that give the same helium abundance , rather than real limits . of course , from these contours which contain the raw information an educated reader can judge which helium abundance should be considered plausible or not .",
    "we now illustrate in concrete models the fact that such values of the majoron coupling @xmath2 are theoretically plausible .",
    "different models imply different expectations for the majoron coupling constants @xmath1 and the relation they bear with the mass @xmath20 . our discussion",
    "so far is applicable to the simplest seesaw majoron model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case one expects that @xcite g =  ( ) where @xmath128 is a typical dirac neutrino mass and @xmath129 is the majorana mass of the right - handed 1 singlet neutrino .",
    "clearly @xmath1 values in the range required by nucleosynthesis are quite reasonable say , for @xmath130 gev and @xmath131 gev .",
    "moreover , it is a good approximation in this model to neglect the s - channel scalar exchange diagram of .",
    "there is a wide class of alternative majoron models characterized by a low scale of lepton number violation @xcite .",
    "these models are attractive because they lead to a wide variety of processes which may be experimentally accessible @xcite . in this case one",
    "expects a simple direct correlation between the mass of the neutrinos and the magnitude of the diagonal couplings of neutrinos to majorons .",
    "the mass is simply the product of the yukawa coupling @xmath1 and the vacuum expectation value @xmath132 which characterizes the spontaneous violation of the global lepton number symmetry @xcite , m = g from this it follows that for @xmath133 10 mev and @xmath134 100 gev one obtains @xmath135 .",
    "this situation is therefore characteristic of models where lepton number spontaneously breaks at the weak scale .",
    "there are more complicated models where the degree of correlation between the mass @xmath20 and the lepton number violation scale may be different and may involve more free parameters . just to give a concrete example of such models ,",
    "let us consider the supersymmetric models with spontaneous violation of r parity @xcite .",
    "these models lead to m where @xmath132 is identified with the vacuum expectation value of the right - handed 1 singlet sneutrino and @xmath136 denotes a typical neutralino mass .",
    "the expected values of ( @xmath1,@xmath20 ) are depicted in , obtained when one varies the other relevant free parameters over a theoretically reasonable range .",
    "for all models with low - scale lepton number violation we have shown , by doing the full calculation , that the overall annihilation cross section for annihilation into two majorons can be enhanced by an order of magnitude with respect to our above simplified calculation which neglected the s - channel scalar exchange diagram in .",
    "although this would allow us to weaken our limits , the effect on @xmath1 would only be a factor @xmath137 , so that the limits derived in figure [ neffmg ] could be relaxed by a factor @xmath138 in this class of models .    as a last comment",
    ", we note that the limits obtained in our paper could also be tightened by including the influence of non - equilibrium electronic neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) produced by annihilations on the neutron - to - proton ratio @xcite but , again , the effect is quite small on the bounds derived on @xmath1 .",
    "last but not least , we must compare the limits obtained by primordial big bang nucleosynthesis with those derived from astrophysics .",
    "a new light particle , like the majoron , may have an important effect on stellar evolution and this allows one to place stringent limits on the strength of the interaction of such particles @xcite . in the case",
    "we consider here , the majorons interact predominantly with a heavy @xmath14 ( with the mass in mev range ) , so its influence may be noticeable in supernova explosions when the temperature reaches tens of mev .",
    "the bounds on majoron properties which can be deduced from supernova physics have been widely discussed @xcite and recently analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "for example a majoron with yukawa coupling to electronic neutrinos in the range @xmath139 could be important for supernova physics .",
    "however in our model this coupling to is much smaller",
    ". a majoron coupling constant to tau - neutrinos around @xmath123 may be potentially interesting for supernova physics and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "here we only mention that @xmath1 values larger than ( a few)@xmath140 may be dangerous because the coupling is strong enough for abundant production of majorons in high temperature regions in the supernova core and simultaneously small enough so that the mean free path of the produced majorons is larger than the central stellar core .",
    "still the coupling @xmath141 seems to be allowed .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the implications for primordial nucleosynthesis of a heavy tau neutrino in the mev range , in the presence of sufficiently strong annihilations into majorons .",
    "we have determined the effective neutrino number @xmath0 , or equivalently the primordial helium abundance , and studied the level of sensitivity that it exhibits when expressed in terms of the underlying mass and coupling parameter @xmath1 , the relevant coupling constant determining the annihilation cross section .",
    "given the fact that present nucleosynthesis discussions are still plagued by systematics , it is useful to interpret our results this way , rather than as an actual limit in the statistical sense .",
    "for each value , one can in principle identify the corresponding lower bounds on @xmath1 for which the annihilations to majorons are sufficiently efficient in order not to be in conflict with nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the standard model , these models can account for a value of @xmath3 if the mass lies in the region 1 - 10 mev , provided @xmath142 .",
    "we have been conservative in determining the nucleosyhthesis limits , to the extent that we have neglected model - dependent contributions from s - channel higgs boson exchange , given in .",
    "this seems reasonable from the point of view of the relevant particle physics models @xcite .",
    "we have also concluded that , indeed , the required choice of parameters can be naturally realized in majoron models both with weak and large - scale lepton number violation . as a result , for sufficiently large but plausible values of the majoron coupling @xmath2 one can not rule out any values of the mass up the present laboratory limit based on the cosmological argument .",
    "this highlights the importance of further experimental efforts in laboratory searches for the mass .",
    "improvements expected at a tau - charm factory are indeed necessary , since the primordial nucleosynthesis constraints on the mass can be easily relaxed in a large class of extensions of the standard electroweak model .",
    "here we show why one can neglect the s - channel diagram of in the determination of the nucleosynthesis bound on @xmath20 and majoron coupling @xmath1 .",

    ", one can see that @xmath144 is proportional to the couplings @xmath148 and @xmath149 . when @xmath150 the s - channel becomes zero .",
    "the value of @xmath144 depends very much on the model . for the pure - singlet majoron models with low lepton number violation scale considered in ref .",
    "@xcite there is a strict correlation between the mass and the lepton number violation scale . in this case one",
    "has @xmath151 . for seesaw models , with lepton number violated at a large mass scale , one has @xmath152 . for the supersymmetric model with spontaneous breaking of r parity @xcite at the weak scale",
    "one can show that @xmath144 typically lies in a range around the value 1/2 .",
    "in our analysis we wanted to stay as much model independent as possible . in order to have an idea of the dependence of our results on @xmath144 we define @xmath153    which is just the integrand of in section [ bef ] . in",
    "we plot the function @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "we see that the value @xmath157 represents a lower bound on that integral . for most models",
    "we would get a higher value . if we notice that the cross section is proportional to @xmath158 , that diference in @xmath154 would translate into a smaller value needed for @xmath1 to satisfy the nucleosynthesis bounds .",
    "therefore , one can obtain a model - independent and conservative bound by taking the worst possible case , which corresponds to @xmath157 . due to the dependence of @xmath159 on @xmath158",
