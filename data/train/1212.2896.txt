    "therefore , maximum entanglement is achieved at the conditions that , dynamically , optimize the squeezing of the mirror mode .",
    "clearly , the true physical situation at hand is somehow different from this intuitive picture as we deal with a stationary state that is affected by losses and noise .",
    "the above discussion , however , is sufficient to get an intuition of the physical process at hand .",
    "let us now shift our attention to the cavity field state and consider the wigner function @xmath81 associated with its reduced state .",

    "( [ w ] ) with @xmath82 and its behavior is shown in figs .",

    "the cavity field squeezing appears to be a simple consequence of the coupling to the mirror .",

    "the sudden squeezing of the cavity field state , which is absent in the mirror state , may be due to the different initial conditions assumed for the two subsystems .",
    "the explicitly mixed nature of the mirror state ( due to the thermal background of phononic modes ) requires the enhancement of the nonlinear character of the interaction with the field in order to exhibit significant squeezing .",
    "this is effectively achieved via a non - zero detuning . on the other hand ,",
    "as the cavity field is prepared in a coherent state , even a resonant interaction significantly affects its state .    by following the same line as in the case of the mirror",
    ", we can calculate the effective mean occupation number and degree of squeezing of the field state against the optomechanical coupling and the detuning , so as to gather a complete picture ( see fig .  [ solido ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath90 which can be easily calculated by using eq .",
    "( [ tipica ] ) and the approaches of refs .",
    "any resulting expression is however too lengthy to be reported here and we summarize our findings in fig .",

    "the effective squeezing , on the other hand , starts from zero as a concave function , soon becomes convex and grows as @xmath92 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ solido ] * ( b)*. this proves that even at @xmath84 squeezing of the field state should be expected . on the other hand ,",
    "as previously commented , we have checked that no squeezing appears in the mirror state at resonance .    * ( a ) *    at @xmath84 , tuning @xmath88 simply determines the isotropic increase of the width of @xmath46 .",
    "we now address a second interesting point : different from the case of the mirror state , @xmath93 at @xmath94 rotates ( in the phase space ) with the degree of squeezing , which implies that the squeezing factor of the field state is complex and provides additional information on the mechanism for setting entanglement within the system .",
    "in fact , by using again the equivalent interferometric description depicted before , one can conclude that along with the amount of squeezing of the mirror state , an important role is played by the relative direction of squeezing of the two subsystems states .",
    "while the state of the mirror is squeezed along a fixed direction in phase space , the direction of squeezing of the field changes with the detuning as shown in fig .",
    "[ wignerfield ] , thus affecting the amount of entanglement in the output modes . in this picture",

    "it is important to note that a study including larger values of @xmath88 is not possible unless the set of parameters we are using is adjusted . indeed ,",
    "larger values of @xmath88 soon put the system in a regime of instability where a stationary solution to the langevin equations is no longer possible . as we would like to keep the level of technicalities related to the search for stability regions away from our discussion",

    "for instance , by taking the degree of squeezing of the reduced state of the mirror as an indicator of its non - classicality , is there a way to push it closer to the vacuum limit ?",
    "here we consider measurements performed over the field interacting with the mechanical mirror as well as an ancillary mode that is superimposed to the field state at a beam splitter .",

    "a first proof - of - principle demonstration has been reported recently  @xcite .    in any case , the linearity of the relations at hand allows to work directly with @xmath33 .",
    "we restrict our attention to gaussian measurements , which preserve the gaussian character of the state being measured .",
    "we explicitly consider projective measurements of a field mode onto the vacuum and homodyne measurements .",

    "[ wignersequenceproj ] , where the large initial squeezing and its decrease to zero are clearly evident ) .",
    "although effective in pushing the mirror towards a more non - classical state , the strategy used above obviously can not be used to affect the optomechanical entanglement . in order to achieve this task , we have to consider an ancillary mode that effectively introduces an additional control .",
    "we thus consider a second field , superimposed to the one studied so far at a beam splitter with a tunable splitting ratio @xmath120 .",
    "the ancilla is initially prepared in its vacuum state and , consistently with the analysis above , projections onto vacuum are considered .",

    "what has to be expected from this thought - experiment , we have to analyze the dynamics of the entanglement within the tripartite system comprising the mirror and the two fields .",

    "<S> we characterize the local properties of an optomechanical system comprising the movable mirror of a resonator and its intracavity field , mutually coupled via radiation - pressure . </S>",
    "<S> our approach shows that both the state of the mirror and the field can be interpreted as squeezed thermal states whose dynamical properties can be tuned by properly choosing the working parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to design conditional procedures for the amplification of the correlation properties of the optomechanical state . </S>",
    "<S> our study is a step forward in the understanding of the physics that rules a system of current enormous experimental interest .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of quantum dynamics of a macroscopic system is an outstanding goal in modern physics . </S>",
    "<S> several paths have been followed in order to achieve macroscopic quantum mechanical behaviors , using nano - electro - mechanical devices coupled to single - electron transistors or optomechanical systems coupling electromagnetic fields and vibrating mechanical structures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the _ desideratum _ </S>",
    "<S> common to all such physical situations is the achievement of negligible thermal excitations of any mechanical system , whose energy has to be pushed down to a level comparable with their specific single - quantum transition energy . </S>",
    "<S> recently , some notable results have been achieved in this respect , both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite , by exploiting back - action induced mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , correlations of quantum mechanical nature have been predicted in micro - optomechanical systems , resilient to the exposure to markovian environmental noise and relatively high operating temperatures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> progresses towards the experimental revelation of their classical counterparts have been recently reported  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this complements previously studied unitary dynamics  @xcite and sets the ground for realistic experimental investigations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , operative schemes for the observation of optomechanical entanglement have been suggested , based on the use of ancillary fields and all - optical observations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> noticeably , very recently , evidences of quantum effects in the motion of a mechanical system have been observed  @xcite .    in the optomechanical </S>",
    "<S> setting comprising an optical cavity with a movable mirror coupled to light through radiation pressure forces , however , a complete understanding of the effects that the coupling with light has on a micromechanical device is still lacking . the `` not immediately intuitive '' nature of the correlations studied in  @xcite , for instance , deserves a deeper investigation : the properties of the whole system and its constituents have to be properly unravelled . in this context , in consideration of the formal equivalence between the movable mirror and a quantum harmonic oscillator , it is natural to use techniques and tools of quantum optics to provide a more explicit interpretation of the dynamics of the system </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the direction considered in this paper , where we draw a phase - space analysis of the cavity mirror - field system depicted above . </S>",
    "<S> this allows not only for a complete characterization of both the mirror and the field as squeezed thermal states , but also the identification of conditioning strategies , based on measurement and postselection , through which the state of the mirror is significantly modified .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ formalism ] we introduce the formalism and technical details being used in order to tackle the problem at hand . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed and extensive description of the methods can be found in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> [ wigner ] is devoted to the description of the dynamics , in phase space , of the reduced state of the mirror and the field of one of the cavities . </S>",
    "<S> we determine occupation number and degree of squeezing of the equivalent squeezed thermal states used in order to effectively describe the reduced state of each subsystem . in sec .  </S>",
