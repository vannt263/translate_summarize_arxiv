    "millisecond radio pulsars ( msrps ) are believed to descend from the neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that have been spun up by acquiring angular momentum through accretion of matter from their companions @xcite .",
    "khz quasiperiodic oscillations and millisecond pulse periods of neutron stars in several lmxbs support this theory ( @xcite and references therein ) and the most compelling proof came from the msrp j1023 + 0038 which has lost its accretion disc within the past decade @xcite . in spite of continuing efforts to understand the evolution of lmxbs @xcite ,",
    "sometimes discoveries of msrps with peculiar characteristics impose problems and compel us to think of alternative scenarios .",
    "two such systems are binary msrps psr j1903 + 0327 which has an eccentric orbit @xcite and psr j1614 - 2230 which is highly recycled with comparatively larger companion mass @xcite ; and special evolutionary channels have been proposed for these objects @xcite .",
    "but all these evolutionary models usually ignore the effects of binding energies of neutron stars which should be taken care of for a more realistic understanding of the binary evolution as neutron stars posses significant amounts of binding energies . in the present work ,",
    "we show that the change in the total binding energy in accretion driven evolution is significant and should be incorporated in realistic models of binary evolutions .",
    "the gravitational mass of a neutron star is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass density at a radial distance @xmath2 from the center and @xmath3 is the radius of the neutron star .",
    "this is the measurable entity and being used in studies of neutron star mass distributions @xcite .",
    "but in the case of relativistic objects like neutron stars , one should think about the proper volume element @xmath4 which becomes @xmath5^{-1/2 } \\",
    ", dr$ ] in schwarzschild geometry .",
    "so the proper mass of the neutron star becomes @xmath6^{-1/2 } \\rho(r ) \\ , dr$ ] and the total number of particles ( baryons ) becomes @xmath7^{-1/2 } n(r ) \\ , dr$ ] where @xmath8 is the particle number density at @xmath2 .",
    "this makes one define the baryonic mass as @xmath9^{-1/2 } n(r ) \\ , dr$ ] where @xmath10 is the mass of a baryon .",
    "the binding energy of the neutron star is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the velocity of light and the gravitational binding energy of the neutron star is @xmath13 . as the only difference in the expression of @xmath14 from that of @xmath15 is the appearance of the metric element @xmath16^{-1/2}$ ] inside the integral , so @xmath17 is actually the manifestation of the space - time curvature for objects as compact as neutron stars .",
    "solving tollman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations of hydrostatic equilibrium , one can obtain the values of all these entities with a suitable choice of the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention here that although tov equations have been derived for non - rotating stars in schwarzschild geometry , these are good enough even for the millisecond pulsars .",
    "the definition of the proper volume @xmath4 is different for a rotating - star where the metric is different , but we have found with the freely available  rapidly rotating neutron star \" code by nikolaos stergioulas that for a fixed value of @xmath18 , @xmath19 usually decreases by an amount less than 1% if we increase the angular velocity @xmath20 from zero to 3000 @xmath21 .",
    "so in the present work , we keep ourself confined within schwarzschild geometry .",
    "one important question that arises here is what is the value of @xmath10 ? following @xcite , we set @xmath10 equal to one atomic mass unit ",
    "_ u _ \" ( based on @xmath22 scale , 931.49402 mev ) which is appropriate as pre - collapse evolved stars contain large amounts of @xmath22 or nuclei of similar binding energy per nucleon .",
    "the mass of @xmath23 is 1.007825 _ u _ and the mass of @xmath24 is 4.002602 _ u _ , so choosing @xmath25 _ u _ is valid even for the present work although we are mainly concerned about the change in @xmath26 due to the accretion of hydrogen or helium rich matter on the neutron star from its binary companion ( usually in the red - giant phase ) .    among numerous nuclear esos",
    ", we choose a standard eos apr @xcite which agrees with the possible @xmath27 regions for three neutron stars determined from x - ray observations of thermonuclear bursts @xcite as well as gives maximum value of @xmath15 to be greater than the mass of the most massive neutron star discovered till date - the millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 having @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "but there is a possibility of discovering even heavier neutron stars in future - the  black widow \" pulsar b1957 + 20 may be one such example which has the lower limit of @xmath15 as @xmath29 with the best fit value as @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "further study is needed to get a precise mass measurement for this neutron star .",
    "but at the present situation , one should not exclude very stiff esos in any study involving esos . as an example of such a stiff eos , we use ms0 @xcite although it disagrees with the findings of @xcite . as an eos much softer that apr would not give @xmath15 as high as @xmath31",
    ", we do not use any such eos .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that the statistical method of @xcite favors esos which are even softer than apr at high densities ( see their figure 8) .",
    "but their results fail to give @xmath15 as high as @xmath32 and there is enough scope to improve their method ( see their discussions ) . on the other hand",
    ", the study of the cooling phase of the x - ray burster 4u 1724 - 307 by @xcite favors an eos as stiff as ms0 .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mrbn ] , we show mass - radius relations of neutron stars as obtained by solving tov equations with these two esos .",
    "it is clear that the difference between three types of masses increases with the increase of @xmath18 leading to the increase in @xmath17 and @xmath33 with @xmath15 ( shown in the middle and bottom panels of the same figure ) .",
    "this happens because with the increase of @xmath15 , neutron stars become more compact and the general relativistic effects more dominant . for a fixed value of @xmath15 , the values of @xmath17 and @xmath33 are higher for a softer eos than those for a stiffer eos due to the higher compactness of the neutron star in the first case",
    "this fact had been observed earlier by @xcite . while @xmath17 is useful to understand general relativistic effects , it is @xmath33 which is relevant in case of the accretion driven evolution which we discuss next .",
    "we study the role of the binding energy in the evolution of millisecond pulsars which are the results of the mass accretion onto the initial slow neutron stars from their companions .",
    "let us assume a millisecond pulsar with gravitational mass @xmath34 and binding energy @xmath35 initially was a slow neutron star with the gravitational mass @xmath36 and binding energy @xmath37 before the accretion process started . here",
    "@xmath38 implying @xmath39 ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mrbn ] ) .",
    "the increase in the gravitational mass is @xmath40 and the increase in the binding energy is @xmath41 and the total amount of mass accreted is given by @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately , people usually assume @xmath43 ; one of the main aims of the present paper is to point out this error .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : macc ] we plot @xmath36 along x - axis , @xmath34 along y - axis and @xmath44 as the colour palette .",
    "the increase of @xmath15 of a neutron star with the amount of accreted matter can be studied along a straight line parallel to the y - axis .",
    "the x - coordinate of the line will give the initial value of the @xmath15 ( @xmath36 ) and the y - coordinate at any point in the line will give the final value of @xmath15 ( @xmath34 ) for which the amount of mass accreted can be obtained from the colour at that point .",
    "but @xmath36 is not the observable entity , it is @xmath34 which can be measured . by noting the colours at different points along a straight line parallel to the x - axis , one can get the amount of accreted mass , where the y - coordinate of the straight line should be set equal to the measured value of @xmath34 and the x - coordinate of any point along the line will correspond to the assumed value of @xmath36 . let us substantiate this for the case of the millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 which has @xmath45 @xcite , spin period 3.15 ms and a companion of mass @xmath46 . table [ tb : macc ]",
    "shows the values of @xmath44 for different values of @xmath47 setting @xmath48 .",
    "we find that @xmath44 ( @xmath49 ) is quite high for @xmath50 which is difficult to explain with present evolutionary models .",
    "there are two possibilities to explain the fact , first the neutron star was probably born massive ( @xmath51 ) or the accretion process is much more efficient .",
    "further study is needed to be sure of possible origin of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "moreover , we see from table [ tb : macc ] that for fixed values of @xmath52 and @xmath47 , different esos give different values for @xmath44 . for",
    "a softer eos , fixed values of @xmath52 and @xmath47 give a larger value of @xmath44 than that obtained for a stiffer eos because of the larger compactness of the neutron star in the first case .",
    "thus proper understanding of binary evolution requires the true knowledge of dense matter eos .",
    "similarly for any other msrp , @xmath44 can be estimated with proper choices of @xmath47 and the eos .    .@xmath44",
    "as obtained using esos apr and ms0 for different values of @xmath47 when @xmath48 which gives @xmath53 for eos apr and @xmath54 for eos ms0 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tb : macc ]",
    "the extra contribution of the binding energy to the estimate of total accreted mass @xmath44 makes the recycling process more efficient as the conservation of angular momentum gives @xmath55 . here",
    "the angular momentum of the accreted material is given by @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 is the alfven radius and @xmath58 is the keplerian velocity at @xmath57 ; @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the final angular momentum , moment of inertia and angular velocity and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the initial angular momentum , moment of inertia and angular velocity .",
    "moment of inertia of a neutron star increases almost linearly with the increase of @xmath18 except very close to the maximum mass @xcite .",
    "so if one perform the calculation considering @xmath67 instead of @xmath43 with the same choice of all other parameters , @xmath63 will be higher in the earlier case .",
    "the effect of binding energy will be important in any study for @xmath68 correlation as recently done by @xcite without considering this effect .",
    "we find that neutron stars posses significant amount of binding energies which increase with the increase of the gravitational mass of the neutron stars .",
    "so when a neutron star gains mass by accreting matter from its companion , its binding energy also increases and the amount of accretion needed becomes greater than the difference in the gravitational masses before and after the accretion process .",
    "indeed it is the difference between the baryonic masses before and after the accretion process .",
    "this fact makes it more difficult to explain the evolution of massive msrps like psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "it seems that probably psr j1614 - 2230 was born massive ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then it is quite possible of discovering more neutron stars with such high gravitational masses - even the neutron stars in the double neutron star systems may have such high gravitational masses whereas in the present sample of double neutron stars , the gravitational masses are usually much smaller - with a mean of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "we also find that for the same amount of increase in the gravitational mass of a neutron star , different equations of state predict different values for the increase in the total binding energy .",
    "this fact reveals the importance of knowing the true nature of the matter inside a neutron star for better understanding of the evolution of the neutron star through mass accretion from its companion .",
    "we use two sample esos in this work but the correctness of these are not firmly established .",
    "measurement of the moment of inertia from the faster component of the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 @xcite or detection and analysis of low - frequency ( @xmath70 hz ) gravitational waves @xcite might help us to constrain dense matter esos in near future .",
