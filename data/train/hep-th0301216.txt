    "a fermi ball @xcite , a kind of non - topological soliton @xcite , is composed of three parts : a false vacuum domain , a domain wall enveloping the domain , and zero - mode fermions @xcite confined in the domain wall . the fermi ball is stabilized owing to the dynamical balance of the shrinking force due to the surface energy and the volume energy , and the expanding force due to the fermi energy .",
    "the fermi ball is thought to be a candidate for one kind of cold dark matter in the present universe @xcite .",
    "macpherson and campbell pointed out that such stability holds good only for the spherical shape of the fermi ball @xcite .",
    "they further showed that the fermi ball is not stable against the deformation of the spherical shape , and thus flattens and fragments into tiny fermi balls .",
    "the destabilization is caused by the volume energy of the fermi ball .    we , however , pointed out that the perturbative correction due to the domain wall curvature can stabilize the fermi ball when the volume energy is small enough compared to the curvature effect @xcite . in case of a simple model with a single fermion flavor , we found that only in the quite narrow region of the parameters does the fermi ball become stable .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to examine how the fermion content of the model affects the stability of the fermi ball . as an example , we consider an extended model in which fermions with multi - flavors are coupled to a scalar field through yukawa coupling . since the pauli s exclusion principle does not apply to the different flavors of the fermions , the stable region of the parameters is expected to broaden .",
    "we consider the following lagrangian density , @xmath4 where the scalar potential @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 if the quantity @xmath7 is zero , the lagrangian density is invariant under the @xmath0 transformation , @xmath8 .",
    "there is , however , a small but a finite quantity @xmath9 , where the invariance is not a strict one .",
    "we consider a spherical fermi ball with the radius @xmath10 , and assume that the wave function @xmath11 and the boson @xmath12 are static and that @xmath12 depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the eigenfunction of the total angular momentum squared @xmath14 , the @xmath15 component @xmath16 and the parity @xmath17 with the eigenvalues of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath11 is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spherical spinors having the eigenvalues @xmath25 and @xmath19 , with @xmath26 . substituting eq.([fygy.eqn2 ] ) into the lagrangian @xmath27 , we obtain @xmath28=      -\\int_{0}^{\\infty}{\\rm d}r~      \\left [      4\\pi r^2\\left\\ {          \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{{\\rm d}\\phi}{{\\rm d}r}\\right)^2          + u(\\phi)\\right\\ }      + \\sum_i\\sum_{km }      \\psi_i^{\\dagger}h_f\\psi_i      \\right]~~ , \\label{ll.eqn2}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "since the fermi ball is a ground state with a fixed number of fermions , @xmath32 we obtain the wave function @xmath33 and the scalar field @xmath12 by extremizing @xmath34=l[\\phi,\\psi_i ]      + \\sum_i\\epsilon_i \\left (          \\sum_{km}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}{\\rm d}r~              \\psi_i^{\\dagger}\\psi_i -n_i\\right)~~ , \\label{le.eqn2}\\ ] ] with the lagrange multipliers @xmath35 .",

    "we take the thin - wall approximation and obtain the correction due to the finite curvature radius @xmath10 by the perturbation with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "we expand @xmath12 , @xmath33 , and @xmath40 in the power of @xmath39 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 with @xmath43 . from @xmath44",

    "we note that the second term of the r.h.s . of eq.([eqm0phi.eqn2 ] ) vanishes .",
    "the leading order of the eigenvalue is given by @xmath60 where we take @xmath61 positive ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we have solutions for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 substituting the solutions into eq.([e.eqn2 ] ) , we obtain the energy of the fermi ball , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the leading order contribution to the energy , @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the energy correction of the order of @xmath72 , @xmath73 in the above equations , we use the relations , @xmath74    ( 1)_stability in the leading order approximation _ + let us examine the stability of the fermi ball within the leading order approximation in the @xmath75-expansion . from @xmath76 , we get the minimizing radius , @xmath77 and the energy at the radius , @xmath78 we note @xmath79 at @xmath80 .    in order to examine the stability against the fragmentation , we compare two states ; a state @xmath81 in which a single fermi ball has the fermion number @xmath1 for @xmath3-th flavor , and a state @xmath82 in which @xmath83 fermi balls have the fermion number @xmath84 each and conserve the total fermion number as @xmath85 for each flavor .",

    "we evaluate eq.([c.eqn2 ] ) using a numerical integration , and obtain the stable region of the parameters where @xmath117 is positive ( see figures [ onphase.fig ] and [ glfixphase.fig ] ) .     and the yukawa coupling constant @xmath112 for the fermi ball to be stable against the fragmentation .",

    "[ glfixphase.fig],width=302 ]    these figures show that the allowed regions of the parameters exist for the fermi ball to be stable against the fragmentation ( the shadowed regions in the figures ) .",
    "we see in the figures that the allowed region broadens as the number of the flavors @xmath111 increases .",
    "we have considered a model for the fermi ball in which the fermions with multi - flavors @xmath11 ( @xmath118 ) are coupled to the scalar field @xmath12 and the total fermion number of each @xmath3-th flavor is fixed as @xmath1 .",
    "we have examined the region of the parameters for the fermi ball to be stable against fragmentation , and how the number of the fermion flavors @xmath111 affects the stability .",
    "we have considered the thin - wall fermi ball , i.e. , the radius @xmath10 is much larger than the wall thickness @xmath119 .",
    "we have taken into account the effect due to the finite wall thickness by the perturbation expansion with respect to @xmath75 . in the leading order thin - wall approximation , we have compared the energy of the initial state of a single fermi ball and that of the final state of fragmented @xmath83 fermi balls , with the total fermion number @xmath1 of each flavor @xmath3 being conserved , @xmath85 . we have found that the former is smaller than the latter and thus the fermi ball is stable against fragmentation , except for the special case of @xmath93 with @xmath95 .",

    "this tells us that even in that case the fermi ball is stable when @xmath114 takes a positive value in the parameter region of @xmath116 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
