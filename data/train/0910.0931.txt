    "universal extra dimension ( ued ) @xcite and its recent extension split - ued @xcite are flat extra dimension models based on a @xmath1 orbifold .",
    "all standard model fields are universally propagating through the 5d bulk so that their kaluza - klein ( kk ) excited states are phenomenologically important if the compactification scale is low ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the model has an underlying symmetry , called the kk parity , that prevents the lightest kk odd state to decay .",
    "if such a state is neutral , then it provides a viable dark matter candidate . in the minimal setup",
    ", the gauge group is the same as the standard model one , @xmath3 .",
    "quarks and leptons are also alleviated to higher dimensional ones and their kk spectra are doubled .",
    "one chirality of their zero modes is projected out by the orbifold condition , leaving the other one as the standard model fermions .",
    "the most prominent feature of split - ued is the presence of ( double ) kink masses for fermions while keeping the kk parity .",
    "the five dimensional action of split - ued is the same as the minimal ued ( mued ) except the 5d bulk mass terms : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the bulk dirac spinors containing quarks and leptons in their zero modes and the kink mass , @xmath6 , is introduced with a step function defined as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 signs depends on the the chirality of the zero mode .",
    "once 5d bulk mass is introduced , kk fermions get additional masses and become heavier @xmath10 where the first term , second term and third term are coming from the ordinary sm yukawa interaction , the momentum of the extra dimension and the 5d bulk mass , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is determined by @xmath12 for kk even modes and the n - th solution of @xmath13 for kk odd modes .",
    "having the generic idea of split - ued , we can control the kk spectra by turning on some bulk mass parameters . in order to suppress the hadronic annihilation cross section and avoid the unnecessary flavor problems , we first choose our 5d bulk masses for quarks to be universal and larger than the typical kk scale , which is @xmath14 .",
    "for the charged leptons , in order to control their annihilation cross section ratio among different flavors which are dominantly coming from the right - handed components , we choose separate 5d bulk masses @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 to achieve that . we left the bulk masses of the left - handed leptons to be small to evade the experimental constrains from the lepton flavor violation and four fermion operators .",
    "the kk dark matter ( @xmath18 ) , mainly annihilates into fermion pairs among which charged lepton pair is dominant . stable particles , like proton ( p ) , electron ( @xmath19 ) and photon ( @xmath20 ) , and their antiparticles are generated from the casecade decay of hadrons and heavy charged leptons in the @xmath21 annihilation process and propagate to the earth .",
    "in @xcite we calculate the electron , positron and gamma - ray flux from the annihilation of @xmath18 and compare them with the recent observations from pamela @xcite , atic @xcite and fermi - lat collaborations @xcite .    ) with @xmath22 gev , compared with pamela data .",
    "the mass of kk quark is taken to be about @xmath23 .",
    "the black curve is for @xmath24 case and the blue curve is for @xmath25 case . _",

    "[ fig1],title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig  [ fig1 ] , we fit the positron fraction ( @xmath26 ) in the pamela energy range ( upper ) and electron plus positron flux ( @xmath27 ) in the fermi - lat range ( lower ) with @xmath28 gev . for fitting the atic `` peak and sharp drop - off pattern '' ,",
    "a lower mass @xmath29 gev is preferred as shown in @xcite .",
    "the anti - proton flux is not a problem in split - ued because the hadronic branching fraction is suppressed by heavy kk quark masses . in the figures we took @xmath30",
    "so that the hadronic branching fraction is less than @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the gamma - ray signal for inner galactic plane region and the region of intermediate galactic latitudes .",
    "the black curve is the sum of primary and ics contributions , the blue and red lines are the gamma - ray from @xmath32 and hadrons from @xmath18 dark matter annihilation , respectively , and the magenta lines are contributions of three components of ics . in the region of low energy ( @xmath33 gev ) , the dark matter signal is much smaller than the observed data , however , starting from few tens of gev , the signal is about a factor of @xmath34 smaller .",
    "a characteristic of our model is that a bump at @xmath35 gev can be seen , due to the main contributions from primary @xmath32 and also the ics from the star light in a subleading way , which can be checked soon if higher energy of gamma ray data is available .",
    "we also show the case of universa kk lepton in dashed line for reference .",
    "the behavior is similar to the non - universal case , but with more energetic gamma - ray due to more hard @xmath36 and more @xmath32 .",
    "dark matter annihilation for the regions of inner galactic plane ( _ upper _ ) and intermediate galactic latitudes ( _ lower _ ) .",
    "the black solid and dashed curves are the sum of primary and inverse compton scattering ( ics ) contributions when the final state charged lepton branching ratios are @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( upper ) . because of the large mass splitting between the 1st kk quark @xmath47 and 1st kk gluon @xmath48 , we can separate out the production of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 by using the @xmath52 cuts .",
    "we focus on the @xmath53 production , which has two hard jets so that we can distinguish the signals from the sm background .",
    "the split - ued @xmath47 pair signal is simulated by scaling the susy signatures with the same mass spectrum .",
    "after the appropriate cuts , our signal is well above the sm background .",
    "we calculate the @xmath54 distribution of the @xmath47 pair signals as shown in @xcite , and its end point reflects the information for combination of @xmath47 and @xmath48 masses .",
    "although we are unable to determine the mass of individual particle in split - ued , its predictions of the signatures of @xmath53 production at the lhc , e.g. @xmath55 and @xmath54 , can be examined whether they are consistent with the cosmic - ray signatures in the near future , and vice versa .",
    "because of the kk number violation at the tree level , the kk even gauge bosons , especially the 2nd kk gluon ( @xmath56 ) , can be singly produced at a large rate .",
    "we expect to discover the resonance in the dijet channels against the large qcd background @xcite even in the early stages of lhc ( @xmath57100 @xmath58pb@xmath59 ) . to explore this possibility , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( lower ) , we plot the invariant mass distribution of qcd dijets simulated by madgraph @xcite ( with rough acceptance cuts @xmath60 and @xmath61 gev to reduce the sm background ) .",
