    "it is well known @xcite that due to unitarity one can relate the amplitudes describing three hadronic elastic processes @xmath5 .",
    "namely , if a simple regge pole at @xmath6 contributes in the @xmath7-channel for each of the above - mentioned processes , the residues of the poles are factorized @xmath8 however it is difficult to check directly such a relation .",
    "firstly , there are no experimental data for all three processes ( for example , @xmath9 is missing , if one considers @xmath10 and @xmath11 scattering ) .",
    "secondly , the best fit to the hadronic cross section data is achieved in the models with multiple regge poles rather than with simple ones @xcite .",
    "factorization properties of multiple poles are to be determined .    on the other hand , the dis and total cross - section data @xcite as well as the measurements of the @xmath12 total cross section and of the off - shell photon structure function @xmath13 @xcite are available now .",
    "if factorization is valid in the case of the photon amplitudes then it can be checked for another set of related processes : @xmath14 and , probably , for @xmath15 .    in this talk , we show how to derive the generalized factorization for the partial amplitudes of the related processes at an arbitrary , but common for these amplitudes , @xmath7-channel regge singularity .",
    "we also give arguments in favor of its validity in the photon case and apply the new factorization relations to describe @xmath12 and @xmath16 cross sections .",
    "it is an old result that one can relate the amplitudes describing three elastic processes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the trick is to continue these to the crossed channels @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where they exhibit discontinuities because of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 thresholds .",
    "one then obtains a nonlinear system of equations , which can be solved . working in the complex @xmath25 plane above thresholds ( @xmath26 ) , and defining the matrix @xmath27 one obtains@xmath28 with @xmath29 for the case of two thresholds and @xmath30 .",
    "the latter is made of the amplitudes on the other side of the cut . for any @xmath31 , equation ( [ solved ] )",
    "is enough to derive factorization : the singularities of @xmath32 can only come from the zeroes of @xmath33 taking the determinant of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ solved ] ) , we obtain in the vicinity of @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is regular at the zeroes of @xmath37 . as the l.h.s . is of order @xmath38 we obtain the well - known factorization properties from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) : + @xmath39 the elastic hadronic amplitudes have common singularities ; + @xmath39 at each singularity in the complex @xmath25 plane , these amplitudes factorise .    for isolated simple poles one obtains the usual well - known factorization relations for the residues .",
    "however , it is appropriate to mention here that the relation @xmath40=\\mbox{finite terms},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the position of a zero of @xmath37 , is valid not only for a simple pole but also for any common @xmath25-singularity in the amplitudes .",
    "moreover , it has a more general form than just a relation between residues . to avoid a misunderstanding we would like to note that `` any @xmath25-singularity '' means a singularity of the full unitarized amplitude rather than those partial singularities which are produced _",
    "e.g. _ by @xmath42-pomeron exchange .",
    "these equations are used to extract relations between the residues of the singularities , which can be continued back to the direct channel .",
    "we have extended @xcite the above argument including all possible thresholds , both elastic and inelastic .",
    "the net effect is to keep the structure ( [ solved ] ) , but with a matrix @xmath31 that includes multi - particle thresholds .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that one does not need to continue the amplitudes from one side of the cuts to the other , but that the existence of complex conjugation for the amplitudes is enough to derive ( [ solved ] ) and consequently the factorization relations ( [ factor1],[factor2 ] ) .",
    "hence there is no doubt that the factorization of amplitudes in the complex @xmath25 plane is correct , even when continued to the direct channel .    if @xmath43 has coinciding simple and double poles ( at any @xmath7 or _",
    "e.g. _ colliding simple poles at @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 one obtains the new relations @xmath46 in the case of triple poles @xmath47 the relations become @xmath48    although historically one has used @xmath7-channel unitarity to derive factorization relations in the case of simple poles , it is now clear @xcite that a soft pomeron pole is not sufficient to reproduce the @xmath49 data from hera @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible , using multiple poles , to account both for the soft cross sections and for the dis data @xcite .",
    "we shall see later that relations ( [ double ] , [ triple ] ) enable us to account for the dis photon - photon data from lep .      for photons , due to the fact that an undetermined number of soft photons can be emitted , two theoretical possibilities exist : + i ) the photon cross sections are zero for any fixed number of incoming or outgoing photons @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is impossible to define an s matrix , and one can only use unitarity relations for the hadronic part of the photon wave function . because of this , photon states do not contribute to the threshold singularities , and the system of equations does not close .",
    "the net effect is that the singularity structure of the photon amplitudes is less constrained . @xmath50 and @xmath51 amplitudes must have the same singularities as the hadronic amplitudes , but extra singularities are possible : in the @xmath50 case , these may be of perturbative origin , but must have non perturbative residues . in the @xmath51 case ,",
    "these singularities have their order doubled .",
    "it is also possible for @xmath51 to have purely perturbative additional singularities .",
    "\\ii ) it may be possible to define collective states in qed for which an s matrix would exist @xcite . in this case",
    ", we obtain the same situation for on - shell photons as for hadrons .",
    "however , in the case of dis , virtual photons come only as external states .",
    "because they are virtual , they do not contribute to the @xmath7-channel discontinuities , and hence the singularity structure for off - shell photons is as described in i ) .",
    "let us consider the second possibility in more details and define virtuality of photons as shown in fig.[fig : tmatrix ] .     and @xmath52 .",
    "]    in the case of real photons ( @xmath53 ) we have obtained for the matrix @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) ( see @xcite ) the same expression as in the hadron case ( eq.([solved ] ) ) .",
    "it means that there are no extra singularities in the photon amplitudes besides those contributing to @xmath11 amplitude .    in the dis case ( @xmath56 ) we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 is expressed through @xmath62 .",
    "hence we see that all the on - shell singularities must be present in the off - shell case , but we can have new ones coming from the singularities of @xmath63 .",
    "these singularities can be of perturbative origin ( _ e.g. _ the singularities generated by the dglap evolution ) but their coupling will depend on the threshold matrix @xmath64 , and hence they must know about hadronic masses , or in other words they are not directly accessible by perturbation theory .    in the case of @xmath65 scattering ,",
    "we take @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and obtain @xcite @xmath68 this shows that the dis singularities will again be present , either through @xmath69 , or through extra singularities present in dis ( in which case their order will be different in @xmath70 scattering , at least for @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is also possible to have extra singularities purely from @xmath72 . _",
    "a priori _ these could be independent from the threshold matrix , and hence be of purely perturbative origin ( _ e.g. _ @xmath73 or the bfkl pomeron coupled to photons through a perturbative impact factor ) .",
    "we also want to point out that the intercepts of these new singularities can depend on @xmath74 , and as the off - shell states do not enter unitarity equations , these singularities can be fixed in @xmath0 .",
    "however , their residues must vanish as @xmath75 .    in the following",
    ", we shall explore the possibility that no new singularity is present for on - shell photon amplitudes , and show that it is in fact possible to reproduce present data using pomerons with double or triple poles at @xmath76 .",
    "for a given singularity structure , a fit to the @xmath77 part of proton cross sections , and to @xmath78 data enables one , via relations ( [ solved ] ) , to predict the @xmath79 cross sections . hence we have fitted @xcite @xmath11 and @xmath80 cross sections and @xmath81 parameters , as well as dis data from hera @xcite . the general form of the parametrizations which we used is given , for total cross sections of @xmath23 on @xmath24 , by the generic formula @xmath82 . the first term , from the highest meson trajectories ( @xmath81 , @xmath83 , @xmath23 and @xmath84 ) , is parametrized via regge theory as @xmath85 with @xmath86 gev@xmath87 .",
    "here the residues @xmath88 factorize . the second term , from the pomeron , is parametrized either as a double pole @xcite @xmath89 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & c_{ab}(q^2)+(\\tilde s\\rightarrow -\\tilde s ) \\label{doubfit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or as a triple pole @xcite @xmath90 .",
    "\\label{tripfit}\\ ] ] it may be noted , in the double - pole case , that the parameter @xmath91 is close to the hard pomeron intercept of @xcite . at high",
    "@xmath92 , because the form factor @xmath93 falls off , the logarithm starts looking like a power of @xmath94 , and somehow mimics a simple pole .",
    "it may thus be thought of as a unitarized version of the hard pomeron , which would in fact apply to hard and soft scatterings .",
    "+ in the triple - pole case , this is accomplished by a different mechanism : the scale of the logarithm is a rapidly falling function of @xmath92 , and hence the @xmath95 term becomes relatively more important at high @xmath92 .",
    "the thick and thin curves correspond respectively to the triple - pole and to double pole cases.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   parameter .",
    "the thick and thin curves correspond respectively to the triple - pole and to double pole cases.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    what is really new is that these forms can be extended to photon - photon scattering , using relations ( [ double ] , [ triple ] ) .",
    "the total @xmath51 cross section is well reproduced ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : strho ] ) and the de - convolution using phojet is preferred .",
    "the fit to @xmath99 has quite a good @xmath100 as well .",
    "we have checked that one can easily extend it to @xmath101 gev@xmath102 for the triple pole , and to @xmath103 gev@xmath102 in the double - pole case .",
    "it is interesting that one can not go as high as in ref .",
    "this can be attributed either to too simple a choice for the form factors , or more probably to the onset of perturbative evolution .",
    "[ fig : f2q2 ] shows the @xmath104 fit for some selected @xmath92 bins ( figures for other @xmath105 bins can be found in @xcite ) . as pointed out before , our fits",
    "do reproduce the low-@xmath92 region quite well , but predict total cross sections on the lower side of the error bands .",
    "hence the extrapolation to @xmath106 of dis data does not require a hard pomeron .    for photon structure functions , one needs to add one singularity at @xmath107 corresponding to the box diagram @xcite , but",
    "otherwise the @xmath51 amplitude is fully specified by the factorization relations .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : f2gam ] that the data on photon structure are well reproduced by both parametrizations .    even more surprisingly , it is possible to reproduce the @xmath108 cross sections when both photons are off - shell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsame ] .",
    "this is the place where bfkl singularities may manifest themselves , but as can be seen such singularities are not needed .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that @xmath7-channel unitarity can be used to map the regions where new singularities can occur , be they of perturbative or non - perturbative origin .",
    "indeed , we have seen that although hadronic singularities must be universal , this is not the case for @xmath104 and @xmath109 , as dis involves off - shell particles . nevertheless , up to @xmath110 gev@xmath102 , the data do not call for the existence of new singularities , except perhaps the box diagram . in the case of total cross sections ,",
    "this suggests that it is indeed possible to define an @xmath111 matrix for qed .    for off - shell photons ,",
    "our fits are rather surprising as the standard claim is that the perturbative evolution sets in quite early .",
    "this evolution is indeed allowed by @xmath7-channel unitarity constraints : it is possible to have extra singularities in off - shell photon cross sections , which are built on top of the non - perturbative singularities .",
    "but it seems that regge parametrisations can be extended quite high in @xmath92 without the need for these new singularities .",
    "thus it is possible to reproduce soft data ( _ e.g. _ total cross sections ) and hard data ( _ e.g. _ @xmath99 at large @xmath92 ) using a common @xmath25-plane singularity structure , provided the latter is more complicated than simple poles . furthermore , we have shown that it is then possible to predict @xmath51 data using @xmath7-channel unitarity . how to reconcile such a simple description with dglap evolution , or bfkl results , remains a challenge",
