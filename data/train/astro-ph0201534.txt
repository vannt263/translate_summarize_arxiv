    "the spatial correlation function of galaxy clusters provides an important cosmological test , as both the amplitude of the correlation function and its dependence upon mean intercluster separation are determined by the underlying cosmological model . in hierarchical models of structure formation , the spatial correlation length , @xmath2 , is predicted to be an increasing function of cluster mass , with the exact dependence determined by @xmath3 ( or equivalently @xmath4 , using the constraint on @xmath5 from the local cluster mass function ) and the power spectrum shape parameter , @xmath6 . low density and low @xmath6 models generally predict stronger clustering for a given mass and a greater dependence of the correlation length upon cluster mass .",
