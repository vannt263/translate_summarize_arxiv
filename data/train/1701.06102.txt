    "therefore , we do not have many effective methods to observe the evolution of our universe at @xmath5 , usually referred as the `` cosmological desert '' .",

    "the equivalent isotropic energy radiated in a few seconds can reach up to @xmath6 erg ( see e.g. ,  @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "thanks to the extreme brightness and the immunity to dust extinction of high - energy photons in the gamma - ray band , grb are detectable up to redshift @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the literatures , grb are widely proposed , as a complementary data of sn , to trace the hubble diagram of the universe at high redshifts .",
    "however , different from the consistent luminosities of sn which allows us to qualify sn as an ideal distance indicator , the central engine mechanism of explosions of grb has not yet clearly been understood .",
    "therefore , drawing cosmological implications from grb observations is quite intractable .",
    "recently , many methods have been proposed to achieve some progresses , in order to treat grb as the distance indicator  @xcite .",
    "luminosity or energy correlations of grb are empirical connections between measurable properties of the prompt gamma - ray emission and the luminosity or energy of grb . in recent years",
    ", several empirical luminosity correlations have been statistically proposed from observations , such as various popular two - variable relations : the correlation between spectrum lag and isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath8 )  @xcite ; the correlation between time variability and isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath9 )  @xcite ; the correlation between the peak energy of @xmath10 spectrum and isotropic equivalent energy ( @xmath0 , the amati relation )  @xcite ; the correlation between peak energy and collimation - corrected energy ( @xmath11 )  @xcite ; the correlation between peak energy and isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath12 )  @xcite ; the correlation between minimum rise time of light curve and isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath13 )  @xcite ; and some well - known multi - variable relations , such as the correlation between @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the break time of the optical afterglow light curves @xmath16",

    "determinations of coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 of correlations could tell us whether these empirical luminosity correlations are independent on the redshift , which is very crucial for treating grb as the distance indicator to investigate the evolution of our universe .",
    "in addition , some new models for grb have been proposed in resent years , such as the spectro - temporal multi - component model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this model could result in a new time - resolved relation : the relation between the luminosity of the non - thermal component , @xmath27 , and its corresponding @xmath10 spectral peak energy in the rest frame , @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath29 relation ) .",
    "more importantly , determinations of coefficients can also show the reliability of the calibration of grb luminosity correlations directly . in the literatures ,",
    "there are two methods to calibrate the luminosity correlations : `` self - calibration '' method , which is based on the global fitting technique using all grb data to constrain the cosmological parameters and the coefficients of luminosity correlations simultaneously  @xcite ; `` low - redshift calibration '' method , which is using the low - redshift grb data to obtain the constraints on coefficients of luminosity correlations , and directly extrapolate them to high redshifts to constrain the cosmological parameters using the high - redshift grb data  @xcite .    apparently , these two methods are seriously dependent on the assumption that empirical luminosity correlations are universal and do not evolve with respect to redshift .",
    "in practice , for the amati relation , @xcite first revealed that the systematically significant variations of the intercept @xmath25 and the slope @xmath26 with the cosmological redshift .",
    "later , @xcite investigated the same issue for several other luminosity relations . due to the limited quality of grb samples",
    ", there was no statistically significant evidence for evolution of the calibration parameters .",
    "in addition , as a cosmological probe , the evolution of grb luminosity correlations may result in overestimate or underestimate of cosmological parameters  @xcite .",
    "more recently , in  @xcite , they re - investigated the amati relation using low - redshift ( @xmath30 ) and high - redshift ( @xmath31 ) grb , and found that the coefficients of amati relation in low - redshift grb differs from those of high - redshift grb at more than @xmath32 confidence level .",
    "therefore , they finally concluded that long gamma - ray bursts might not be standard candles .",
    "following on this topic , @xcite further examined the possible redshift dependence of several other luminosity correlations and found that only for the @xmath33 relation , the low - redshift grb could give the similar constraints on the coefficients with those from the high - redshift grb within @xmath34 confidence level .    in this paper",

    "the result is similar with some other works @xcite .",
    "as the statistically obvious evolution of the luminosity correlation has been revealed , we should be careful to use the grb data as the distance indicator for cosmological studies . because all these investigations are based on the assumption that the luminosity correlation does not vary with respect to the redshift , i.e. , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eq .",

    "the red points with error bars represent the best - fit value and 1@xmath59 error of @xmath1 for different numbers of grbs respectively . the red dashed line corresponding to the fiducial value of @xmath45.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +",
    "thanks to the extremely high power of the explosion , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are proposed as a promising candidate to trace the hubble diagram of the universe in high redshift range . in recent years , several popular luminosity correlations have been statistically concluded from grbs observations .",
    "people also have made great efforts to standardize them as cosmological distance indicators . in general",
    ", there are two key issues extensively discussed in the literature when we use these correlations for cosmology .",
    "the first issue is that whether luminosity correlations evolve with redshift .",
    "the other one is about methods to calibrate luminosity correlations . in this paper",
    "we take the amati relation as an example and use the current grb data in the redshift range [ 0.0331 ,  8.1 ] to investigate these two issues . here",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in more detail :    * we divide the whole grb data into two redshift bins and constrain the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the original amati relation in each bin , respectively .",
    "based on the mcmc method , we find that the constraints on both the intercept @xmath25 and the slope @xmath26 are quite different from the low - redshift and high - redshift grb data , respectively . the tension is more than @xmath34 level , which implies that the parameters of original amati relation could be redshift - dependent .",
    "* we introduce two extra redshift - dependent terms to characterize the redshift evolution of the luminosity correlation .",
    "interestingly , we find that the tension between constraints of parameters from low-@xmath50 and high-@xmath50 grb data are alleviated . * besides the evolution of amati correlation , the calibration is also very important for using grb data in cosmological studies .",
    "we firstly check the constraint on the matter density parameter using the low - redshift calibration method and obtain @xmath105 ( 68% c.l . ) which is consistent with other works .",
    "* however , we could also use the global fitting method to calibrate the grb data , in which we use all the grb data to constrain coefficients of the extended amati relation and the cosmological parameters simultaneously . in this case , we find that , due to the current poor precision of the grb data , the constraint on @xmath1 is very weak , which is quite different from that by using the low - redshift calibration method . * after our careful checks , we find that the low - redshift calibration method does not take the whole correlations between @xmath1 and coefficients into account . neglecting the correlation information can break the degeneracies between @xmath1 and coefficients .",
    "therefore , the obtained constraint on @xmath1 is totally biased .",
    "a small shift of the parameters of `` calibrated '' relation could significantly change the final constraint on @xmath1 in the low - redshift calibration method , which implies that the constraint on @xmath1 is very sensitive to the values of parameters for the calibration . * in order to investigate how large biased constraint on @xmath1 by using the low - redshift calibration , we simulate the mock grb data with different precisions .",
    "we find that the mock data with current precision will give significantly biased result using the low - redshift calibration method , even we assume a small shift on the parameters of `` calibrated '' relation . when grb data include larger samples with the current precision or the relative errors of grb data decreases , the constraint on @xmath1 is more and more close to the fiducial value .",
