    "the heavy fermion system ceni@xmath6ge@xmath2 exhibits an outstanding fermi - liquid behavior with the largest value of the electronic specific heat @xmath7jmol@xmath8k@xmath9 ever recorded in the absence of any magnetic order @xcite .",
    "the crystal field , investigated by single crystal susceptibility analysis , consists of a quasi - quartet ground state and one doublet at @xmath10mev ( @xmath11k ) @xcite . the quasi - quartet is internally split into two doublets separated by @xmath12mev ( @xmath13k ) .",
    "the kondo - temperature @xmath14k , determined by inelastic neutron scattering studies , falls in the same energy - range as the splitting of the quasi - quartet ground state . +",
    "while this unusual fermi - liquid behavior is mainly driven by single - ion effects @xcite , ni / cu substitution leads to antiferromagnetic order in ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 with @xmath15mk .",
    "profound analysis of specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity of the substitution - series ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1ge@xmath2 reveals a continuous tuning of the ground state from an effectively fourfold degenerate nonmagnetic kondo ground state in ceni@xmath6ge@xmath2 towards a magnetically ordered , effectively twofold degenerate ground state in ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 @xcite . around the critical cu - concentration of @xmath16",
    "the system exhibits quantum critical behavior with @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "previous investigations on the system suggested , that this quantum phase transition is not only driven by the competition between kondo - effect and rkky interaction , but also by a reduction of the effective crystal field ground state degeneracy , caused by two or more different crystal field environments of the ce@xmath3-ion @xcite . to prove these suggestions , which were mainly based on specific heat measurements",
    ", we performed neutron scattering experiments on the compound ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 in order to study the crystal field and the disorder effects , occurring in the chemical environment of the ce@xmath3-ion .",
    "several polycrystalline samples of ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 and of the nonparamagnetic reference compound lani@xmath5cuge@xmath2 have been synthesized by arc melting of pure elements in a highly purified argon atmosphere .",
    "the samples were flipped over several times and remelted to obtain the highest possible homogeneity .",
    "after annealing the samples under vacuum for one week at 950@xmath20c , x - ray diffraction was used to check the phase purity .",

    "about 35 g of each compound were filled in a thin double - walled aluminium can mounted onto a closed - cycle refrigerator , whereas for powder diffraction experiment on ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 a single - wall cylindric vanadium container ( 14 mm in diameter , 0.15 mm wall thickness ) was used .",

    "it is evident that x - ray diffraction did not revealed any ordering of copper in the lattice due to the minute differences in the scattering factors of ni and cu . in order to determine which of the individual ni - sites",
    "is preferentially substituted by cu and to estimate the degree of ni / cu disorder in ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 a neutron diffraction experiment was performed at 300k and 4k .",
    "first , the sample homogeneity was checked by a full profile decomposition technique , where the background ( determined by a linear interpolation between points in non - overlapping regions ) , lattice , profile ( pseudo - voigt function ) and asymmetry parameters were refined .",
    "a rather weak , but still noticeable reflection broadening was observed over the entire @xmath27-range accessible in the diffraction experiment .",
    "after deconvolution with the instrumental resolution function this line broadening could be assigned to a size - effect , which was best simulated with platelet - like shaped crystallites ( ca .",
    "400  in diameter and surface parallel to [ 200 ] ) . in further structure considerations , based on the rietveld method , observed weak microstructural effects were included by simultaneous refinements of the caglioti profile parameters .",
    "for the localization of the copper atoms in the lattice , the occupancies of the different ni sites were checked . as a result of the best rietveld fit ( fig.[fig1 ] ) 99% of the copper atoms",
    "could be located on the ni1 site .",
    "this is in good agreement with bandstructure calculations based on the new full - potential augmented spherical wave method @xcite , which clearly show an energetic preference for a ni / cu substitution at the ni1 site .",
    "furthermore , a little excess of the occupancy on the @xmath24-place of both ni and ge was found , which is probably related to a weak static disorder existing in the material .",

    "part of the scattering and the detector efficiency",
    ". the main challenge in the quantitative interpretation of measured ins spectra is to derive the phonon contribution correctly , particularly in compounds , such as ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 , that have a large nuclear cross section .",
    "the phonon correction used in our case , was based on the different @xmath27-dependencies @xmath30 of the phononic ( approximately @xmath31 ) und magnetic scattering ( form - factor decrease with increasing @xmath27-values ) . therefore , we summed the detector counts at low ( @xmath32 ) and high ( @xmath33 ) scattering angles with the corresponding momentum transfer ranges of @xmath34@xmath8 and @xmath35@xmath8 .",
    "the nonparamagnetic reference compound was used to determine the ratio of the high - angle and low - angle scattering intensities .",

    "two broad excitations around 4.5mev and 12mev are observed in the spectrum , which can be assigned to magnetic transitions .",
    "the deviation from the fit around 2mev could be caused by disorder effects as already mentioned in @xcite . in order to analyze the scattering function in a proper way , we fitted a combination of two gaussian - functions ( dashed line ) , representing the crystal field transitions , and a lorentzian - function ( dash - dotted line ) , describing the elastic scattering line , to our data . from the fit",

    "the crystal field scheme determined from the ins experiments described above is displayed in the insert in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "in contrast to the preliminary results published in @xcite , where the phonon - contribution was taken into account by a simple la - subtraction and which conclude that more than one ce site with different environments exist , we observe only one ce site with @xmath41k and @xmath42k . in fig.[fig3 ] an analysis of the magnetic contribution to the specific heat @xmath29 of ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 considering the above determined crystal field scheme is shown .",
    "the interplay between molecular field and kondo effect within the doublet ground state is regarded by the resonant - level model in combination with a molecular field approach ( for details see @xcite ) . the good agreement with the experimental data",
    "support the investigated crystal field scheme and therefore the fact , that the system ceni@xmath5cuge@xmath2 exhibits only one crystal field environment of the ce - atoms with the cu - atoms localized at the ni1 site .",
    "the deviation between the experimental data and the theoretical adjustment around 7k could be due to a weak static disorder , which can not be excluded , especially because of the observation of the additional scattering intensity in the ins spectra around 2mev .",
    "structural disorder can indirectly be confirmed by relatively high magnitudes of isotropic displacement parameters at 4 k as well as a weak excess occupation on ni2 @xmath43 and ni1 @xmath44 atomic sites .",
    "+ comparing the crystal field scheme with the pure ni - compound ceni@xmath6ge@xmath2 , where the crystal field consists of a quasi - quartet ground state at around @xmath45k and one doublet at @xmath46k , the substitution of ni by cu leads to a splitting of the quasi - quartet into a twofold degenerated ground state and a higher shifting doublet , while the excited doublet remains at almost the same energy .",
    "this reduction of the effective crystal field ground state degeneracy could be related to the quantum phase transition in ceni@xmath0cu@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "so not only to the competition between kondo effect and rkky interaction but also the change in the crystal field could be the driving force in this quantum critical scenario . to prove that this crystal field shift is a crucial tuning parameter in terms of the observed quantum critical transition , further ins experiments on other ni / cu - composition are in progress , to study the change of the crystal field in detail , especially around the quantum critical transition ( @xmath47 itself .",
