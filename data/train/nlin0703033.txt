    "recent studies of complex networks @xcite have shown inhomogeneous connectivities having a small number of highly connected nodes , frequently called as hubs , along with many poorly connected nodes .",

    "the boolean network @xcite is one of the discrete dynamical models for the transcriptional regulatory network and exhibits binary sequences of the state variables that represent expression pattern of the network @xcite .",
    "since the state variables in the network are sensitive to inputs from other nodes via directed edges , and affect other nodes , the quality of communication is characterized as the size of mutual information @xcite .",
    "this mutual information indicates the degree of coherence , synchronization , amount of information content in the state variables , or potential for computational capability of the network @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we show the role of hubs for the emergence of coherence in a boolean network . since we embedded power - law rank outdegree distributions in the boolean networks with an input connectivity of @xmath0= 2 ,",
    "the model networks have some hubs that integrate many outdegree connections . because the hubs synchronously transmit their state to the downstream nodes , these nodes are simultaneously affected by single or multiple hubs .",
    "the structural condition seems to automatically provide global coherence in the state variables ; however , the structural aspects give only the possible effects of the hubs .",
