    "the very first stars to form in the universe are believed to have formed within small protogalactic objects , cooled primarily by molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "molecular hydrogen cooling becomes ineffective at temperatures below @xmath1 , and at gas number densities @xmath2 , and so any dense fragments that form in the cooling and collapsing gas have a characteristic mass of a few hundred solar masses , set by the jeans mass at this temperature and density ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also the reviews of @xcite and @xcite ) . since there is little evidence for sub - fragmentation during later stages of the collapse ( although for a dissenting view see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and since the high gas temperature leads to a high protostellar accretion rate , there seems little to limit the growth of the first stars , which may easily grow to @xmath3 or more ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "efficient cooling from hydrogen deuteride , hd , can alter this scenario .",
    "hd can cool the gas to lower temperatures than @xmath0 , and remains an effective coolant up to higher densities , @xmath4 .",
    "the characteristic mass of stars formed in hd - cooled gas is therefore believed to be smaller , @xmath5 @xcite , reflecting the smaller characteristic mass scale imprinted on the cooling gas .",
    "however , hd cooling will only bring about a change of this kind in the characteristic mass scale if enough forms to cool the gas efficiently .",
    "@xcite show that in simulations following the formation of the very first stars , in protogalaxies with virial temperatures @xmath6 , this does not occur : the inclusion of deuterium chemistry and hd cooling has very little effect on the outcome . on the other hand",
    ", various authors have shown that in gas cooling from an initially ionized state , enough hd forms to cool the gas down to temperatures close to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "note , however , that even without hd cooling the characteristic masses of objects collapsing from gas within a relic primordial hii region have already been demonstrated to be smaller @xcite .",
    "this difference in thermal evolution , depending on whether or not the gas was once ionized , is a consequence of the chemistry of hd formation and destruction .",
    "the dominant reactions regulating the amount of hd in the gas are @xmath7 and @xmath8 reaction 1 is exothermic , while reaction 2 is endothermic by 0.0398  ev ( 462  k ) , and so at low temperatures , chemical fractionation occurs : the hd:@xmath0 ratio becomes enhanced over the cosmological d : h ratio by a large numerical factor .",
    "consequently , even though the hd cooling rate per molecule decreases with decreasing temperature , the hd cooling rate per unit volume can actually increase , owing to the increase in the hd abundance produced by this fractionation process ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in conventional population iii star formation calculations ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , the fractional ionization is small , and because of @xmath9 heating the gas temperature never becomes low enough for chemical fractionation to become efficient .",
    "therefore , hd cooling remains unimportant .",
    "in contrast , in gas cooling from an initially ionized state , more @xmath0 forms , owing to the non - equilibrium fractional ionization in the cooling gas @xcite , and the gas can reach a lower temperature . in practice ,",
    "the extra cooling provided by the enhanced @xmath0 abundance is sufficient to cool the gas to a point at which chemical fractionation becomes very important , following which hd dominates the cooling .",
    "several processes and rate uncertainties , hitherto neglected , may interfere with this simple picture .",
    "first , most calculations assume a ratio of ortho - hydrogen ( @xmath0 with nuclear spin quantum number @xmath10 ) to para - hydrogen ( @xmath0 with @xmath11 ) that is @xmath12 .",
    "this value is appropriate for warm @xmath0 in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , which has many different rotational and vibrational levels populated , but at low temperatures and low densities , the ortho - para ratio may differ significantly from this value .",
    "for instance , if only the @xmath13 and @xmath14 rotational levels of the vibrational ground state are populated , then the equilibrium ortho - para ratio is @xmath15 .",
    "the relevance of this to the current situation lies in the fact that the energy associated with the @xmath16 rotational transition in para - hydrogen , @xmath17 , is significantly smaller than the energy associated with the @xmath18 transition in ortho - hydrogen , @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , para - hydrogen can cool the gas to lower temperatures than ortho - hydrogen .",
    "it is therefore possible that the ability of the gas to cool to the low temperatures required for hd cooling to take over and dominate will be sensitive to the assumed ortho - para ratio , and that the outcome of calculations that determine it accurately will differ from that of calculations that assume a ratio of 3:1 .",
    "a second issue affecting existing calculations is the fact that the low temperature behaviour of the @xmath0 cooling rate remains uncertain .",
    "the root cause of this uncertainty is the sensitivity of the low energy @xmath20-@xmath0 excitation cross - sections to the choice of the interaction potential used to calculate them .",
    "most previous studies of hd cooling in primordial gas have made use of the fit to the low - density @xmath0 cooling rate given by @xcite . at @xmath21 , this fit",
    "is based on excitation rates from @xcite that were calculated using the bkmp2 potential energy surface of @xcite .",
    "however , recently @xcite have published a new set of @xmath0 collisional excitation rate coefficients based on calculations performed using the @xcite potential energy surface .",
    "the @xmath0 cooling function derived from these revised excitation rates differs significantly from the @xcite rate at temperatures @xmath22 , but the consequences of this reduction in the cooling rate have yet to be explored in much detail .",
    "a third issue regarding the @xmath0 cooling rate is that fact that most previous calculations have only included the effects of collisional excitation of @xmath0 by atomic hydrogen .",
    "however , @xmath0 can also be excited by collisions with @xmath0 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . as we show in  [ res - cool ] , in the conditions of interest for hd formation , several of these neglected processes play important roles .",
    "the final issue affecting studies of the role of hd cooling that we examine here is the impact of the large uncertainties that exist in several key rate coefficients for chemical reactions involved in the formation and destruction of @xmath0 .",
    "although some of these uncertainties ( which are discussed in detail in  [ chem - model ] ) have received previous study in the literature @xcite , their impact on the ability of the gas to cool to temperatures at which hd cooling becomes dominant has not previously been explored .    in this paper , we explore these issues with the aid of a detailed chemical and thermal model of primordial gas , coupled to two simple dynamical models . our main aim is to determine whether any of these sources of uncertainty can plausibly lead to significant differences in the evolution of the gas , or whether existing results on the role of hd cooling are robust .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ num ] ,",
    "we outline the numerical model used in this work . in this context",
    ", we also discuss in more detail the major uncertainties highlighted above . in section  [ results ] , we present and discuss our results , and we conclude in  [ concl ] with a brief summary .",
    "to model the chemistry of @xmath0 and hd in primordial gas , we use a chemical network consisting of 115 reactions between 16 species , as summarized in table  [ chem_gas ] .",
    "this network differs significantly from previous treatments of primordial deuterium chemistry in that it includes the formation and destruction of doubly - deuterated hydrogen , @xmath26 .",
    "this is included because it has been suggested ( d.  savin , private communication ) that conversion of hd to @xmath26 at low gas temperatures may be a significant destruction mechanism for hd , although in practice we find that it is unimportant .    for simplicity , we omit @xmath27 , @xmath28 and their deuterated analogues from our chemical model .",
    "the abundances of these species are very small and their influence on the cooling of the gas at intermediate to low densities is minimal @xcite , so their omission should not significantly affect our results .",
    "we also omit lithium , for similar reasons .",
    "we assume that any radiation backgrounds are negligible and so do not include any processes involving photoionization or photodissociation .",
    "we also neglect cosmic ray ionization ; the influence of this latter process on promoting hd cooling has been treated in detail elsewhere @xcite .    whenever possible , rates for deuterated analogues of the basic hydrogen reactions have been taken from the primary literature , or from the compilations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , some reactions do not appear to have been previously considered in the astrochemical literature . in cases where we have been unable to find an appropriate rate ,",
    "we have generally adopted the same procedure as in @xcite : for a non - deuterated reaction with a reaction rate that has a power - law temperature dependence @xmath29 , we have generated the rates of the deuterated analogues by multiplying this rate by a scaling factor @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the reduced masses of the reactants in the non - deuterated and deuterated reactions respectively .    for reactions where the presence of a deuteron increases the number of distinguishable outcomes ",
    "e.g.  the dissociative attachment of @xmath33 with @xmath25 ( reactions 5758 ) , which can produce either @xmath20 and @xmath34 or @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in contrast to the dissociative attachment of @xmath0 with @xmath25 ( reaction 23 ) which can only produce @xmath35 and @xmath20  and where no good information exists on the branching ratio of the reaction , we assume that the probability of each outcome is uniform .",
    "for this particular example , this gives branching ratios of 50% for reactions 57 and 58 respectively .",
    "[ [ associative - detachment - and - mutual - neutralization - of - h -- admn - rates - and - d- ] ] associative detachment and mutual neutralization of @xmath37 [ admn - rates ] and @xmath38 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    the rates of reactions 2 & 5 , i.e. the associative detachment of @xmath35 with @xmath20 : @xmath39 and the mutual neutralization of @xmath35 with @xmath24 , @xmath40 are uncertain by up to an order of magnitude . when the fractional ionization of the gas is small , these uncertainties are unimportant , as in this case reaction 2 proceeds much faster than reaction 5 .",
    "however , in gas with a high fractional ionization , such as gas recombining from an initially ionized state , reaction 5 competes with reaction 2 for the available @xmath35 ions and so the uncertainties in the rates of these reactions introduce a significant uncertainty into the amount of @xmath0 that is formed . a large associative detachment rate and small mutual neutralization rate lead to the production of a larger @xmath0 fraction ( at a given time ) than a small associative detachment rate and large mutual neutralization rate @xcite .",
    "the default value for @xmath41 in our models is @xmath42 based on the measurement of @xcite .",
    "however , in  [ res - chem ] we present results from models performed using @xmath43 and @xmath44 which represent plausible upper and lower bounds on the actual rate @xcite .    similarly , our default value for @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 taken from @xcite , but in  [ res - chem ] we also examine models using @xmath47 taken from @xcite and @xmath48 taken from @xcite .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the last of these rates may be erroneously small , owing to typographical errors in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this rate has been used in a number of recent models of hd formation in primordial gas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , justifying its consideration here .",
    "in view of the large uncertainties in the rates of reactions 2 & 5 , we have assumed that identical rates apply for the deuterated analogues of these reactions ( nos .",
    "5456 and 6668 ) , since any small differences in the basic rates caused by the presence of one or two deuterons in place of protons are likely swamped by this basic uncertainty .",
    "the most accurate cross - section for this process at astrophysically relevant energies is that computed by @xcite ; the corresponding thermal rate coefficient is given in @xcite .",
    "however , as @xcite discuss in some detail , a large number of other rates for this reaction are given in the literature , differing by orders of magnitude at temperatures below @xmath51 .",
    "as this reaction is an important @xmath0 destruction mechanism , particularly in gas recombining from an initially ionized state , and as most previous studies of @xmath33 formation in primordial gas have used one or another of these less accurate rate coefficients ( @xcite are a notable exception ) , it seems appropriate to examine the effect that the choice of this rate coefficient has on the final amount of @xmath0 formed and on the ability of the gas to cool to temperatures at which hd cooling becomes dominant . therefore , while we use the @xcite rate in most of our models , we examine in  [ res - chem ] the effect of using two other rates from the literature .",
    "the first of these , from @xcite @xmath52 is , strictly speaking , only applicable to vibrationally excited @xmath0 , but in spite of this @xcite use this rate for charge transfer with ground - state @xmath0 in their study of @xmath33 cooling .",
    "as the comparison in figure  1 of @xcite demonstrates , this rate is significantly larger than other determinations in the literature .    at the other extreme , @xcite quote a rate @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gas temperature in units of electron - volts .",
    "this rate is based on @xcite , and has subsequently been adopted by a number of authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is much smaller at @xmath55 than any of the other determinations in the @xcite comparison .      in table",
    "[ chem_gas ] , we list two rates for each process : one for @xmath0 that is all in the vibrational ground - state ( appropriate for low density gas ) , and one for @xmath0 with local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) level populations . at intermediate densities , we adopt a rate coefficient for each reaction given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the collisional dissociation rate for collisions with species @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the rates for this reaction in the @xmath61 and lte limits respectively , and @xmath62 is the critical density , given by @xmath63 here , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , and @xmath68,\\ ] ] @xmath69,\\ ] ] and @xmath70,\\ ] ] with @xmath71 .",
    "the expression for @xmath72 is from @xcite , but has been decreased by an order of magnitude , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath73 comes from @xcite , and the expression for @xmath74 comes from @xcite . note that this expression for the critical density assumes that in high density gas , @xmath75 , so that electron excitation of @xmath0 does not significantly affect the value of @xmath62 .      in optically thick gas that is a mixture of neutral h and he",
    ", the effective @xmath77 recombination coefficient is given by @xmath78 where we have assumed that @xmath79 ; see @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "in these conditions , it is also necessary to take account of the photoionization of @xmath20 caused by the @xmath77 recombination emission .",
    "as long as the gas is highly optically thick above the lyman limit , this can be modelled as a local @xmath20 ionization rate with a value @xmath80 where @xmath81.\\ ] ] we have not included a similar contribution from @xmath82 recombination , as in conditions where the @xmath82 abundance is significant , we expect @xmath20 to be almost completely ionized .      at high densities ,",
    "reactions 30 & 31 are important sources of @xmath0",
    ". however , the rate coefficients for these reactions are highly uncertain , as previously discussed in @xcite . to assess the importance of this uncertainty on our results , we have carried out simulations using two different values for @xmath83 : the first , taken from @xcite and partially based on @xcite is the lowest of the values we have found in the literature : @xmath84 the other , taken from the recent paper of @xcite has the highest value at low temperatures of any of the rates we have found : @xmath85 to fix the rate of reaction 31 , we follow @xcite and assume that @xmath86 .",
    "the data tabulated in @xcite span the temperature range @xmath88 . at lower temperatures ,",
    "we simply extrapolate our fit to the higher temperature data : this fit remains well behaved at low temperatures , and since the rate of this reaction falls off exponentially at low @xmath89 , we are not particularly sensitive to errors in its value in this temperature range . at @xmath90 , we use the simple exponential fit given by @xcite to their high temperature calculations ; although not formally valid at these temperatures , the fit remains well - behaved , and hopefully lies not too far from the true value .      for collisions with electrons ,",
    "accurate rates are available in @xcite and @xcite . for collisions with h , @xmath0 or he , however , we have been unable to find a treatment in the literature .",
    "we have therefore assumed that the rates of these reactions in the @xmath61 and lte limits are the same as for the corresponding h reactions ( nos .",
    "for @xmath26 , we also adopt the same value for the critical density , while for hd , we increase @xmath62 by a factor of 100 to account for its larger radiative transition probabilities .",
    "note that although these rates are highly approximate , this probably does not introduce much uncertainty into the chemical model , as reactions 40 and 107 become effective at much lower temperatures and therefore will generally dominate the destruction of hd and @xmath26 in warm gas .      in order to follow the evolution of the ortho - para hydrogen ratio in the gas ,",
    "we directly follow the time - dependent level populations of the lowest four energy levels of the @xmath0 molecule , the @xmath92 and 3 rotational levels of the vibrational ground state .",
    "rates for collisional transitions between these four states are taken from several sources : non - reactive collisions with @xmath20 ( which can not change the ortho - para ratio ) are treated using the rates computed by @xcite , while for reactive collisions ( which _ can _ change the ortho - para ratio ) , we use the rates suggested by @xcite .",
    "collisions with protons are treated using the rates computed by @xcite .",
    "radiative transitions rates are taken from @xcite .",
    "newly - formed @xmath0 is assumed , for simplicity , to reside in the @xmath13 ground state .",
    "this assumption is not correct : @xmath0 formed by associative detachment of @xmath35 is , in general , highly excited and has a non - zero ortho - para ratio @xcite .",
    "however , it is easy to show that this assumption has little effect on the ortho - para ratio . in conditions where associative detachment dominates the destruction of @xmath35 , we can write the @xmath0 formation timescale as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the fractional abundances of @xmath0 and free electrons respectively . in comparison ,",
    "collisions with protons cause the ortho - para ratio to reach equilibrium on a timescale @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the ortho - para ratio , @xmath98 is the fractional abundance of protons , and @xmath99 is an appropriately averaged rate coefficient for the conversion of ortho-@xmath0 to para-@xmath0 by proton collision . from @xcite ,",
    "we know that @xmath100 , while from table  [ chem_gas ] we see that at a representative low temperature of 200  k , @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the timescales are comparable only if @xmath102 if we make the reasonable assumption that @xmath103 , and that @xmath97 is of order unity , then this argument demonstrates that the @xmath0 formation process has a significant effect on the ortho - para ratio only when the @xmath0 fraction is very small , @xmath104",
    ".    a similar comparison can also be performed between the @xmath0 formation timescale and the lifetimes of excited states of @xmath0 , but again the after - effects of the formation process are important only when the @xmath0 fraction is very small .    our model for the ortho - para",
    "ratio becomes increasingly inaccurate at high temperatures , as the excitation of states with @xmath105 or @xmath106 becomes important , but since the sensitivity of the @xmath0 cooling rate to the ortho - para ratio is large only at low temperatures ( see  [ h2_cool_func ] below ) , this simplified approach is sufficient for our purposes .        as we have already discussed in section 1 ,",
    "the low temperature rates for the collisional excitation of @xmath0 by @xmath20 are highly sensitive to the choice of potential energy surface used to describe the @xmath107 system @xcite .",
    "an accurate determination of the @xmath0 cooling function at low temperatures and low gas densities requires a level of accuracy in the potential that has been difficult to achieve , and as a consequence there are a number of determinations of the low - density limit of the @xmath0 cooling function in the literature that differ substantially at temperatures @xmath22 ( see , for instance , the comparison in figure  a1 of * ? ? ?",
