    "heavy meson decays , both inclusive and exclusive , have long been an interesting subject in both experimental and theoretical study .",
    "these decays play their special role in extracting the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and probing new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the inclusive decays of heavy mesons are more difficult to measure but theoretically cleaner than exclusive decays . on the other hand ,",
    "exclusive decays are cleaner in experimental measurements but more difficult in theoretical calculations as they require the knowledge of form factors , which contains long distance ingredients and has to be estimated via nonperturbative methods such as sum rules , lattice simulations or phenomenological models .",
    "the heavy to light exclusive decays can be grouped as semileptonic decays and rare decays . besides using lattice calculations @xcite and quark models @xcite ,",
    "these decays have been analyzed by using sum rules in full qcd @xcite .",
    "since the heavy meson @xmath9 or @xmath10 contains one heavy quark and one light quark , it is expected that the heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) and the effective field theory of heavy quark may help to improve our understanding on heavy to light decays .",
    "recently , some work has been done in this direction @xcite . in particular , in refs.@xcite the @xmath11 decays are investigated within the framework of heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) @xcite , and the relevant form factors are calculated at the leading order of heavy quark expansion , using which @xmath12 is extracted .    this paper will provide a more general discussion on exclusive heavy to light decays within the framework of effective theory .",
    "we shall apply the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) and light cone sum rule ( lcsr ) techniques to more heavy ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) to light ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) exclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "namely , we extend the study to d decays , and also extend it to decays into kaon mesons . we know that the reliability of hqe is different for b and d mesons , and that the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects arise in the kaon systems",
    "so , through a consistent study on decays of both bottom and charm mesons with the final mesons including both nonstrange and strange ones , we aim at a general view on the applicability of the combination of hqeft and lcsr method in studying heavy to light semileptonic decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ formulation ] , we first formulate the heavy to light transition matrix elements in the framework of hqeft , and then present the light cone sum rules for the heavy flavor independent wave functions .",
    "some of the analytic formulae are found to be similar to those presented in refs.@xcite and so have a general meaning . in reviewing them , we pay our main attention to the relations and differences among different decay channels .",
    "section [ result ] contains our numerical analysis on the heavy to light transition form factors .",
    "the numerical results are compared with data from other approaches .",
    "based on the results of section [ result ] , branching ratios are evaluated and discussed in section [ ratio ] . finally a short summary is presented in section [ sum ] .",
    "for convenience of discussions , we denote in this paper the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons as @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , and use @xmath15 to represent the heavy mesons @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "then the decay matrix elements and form factors can be written in a general form as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17 in the currents ( not to be confused with the lepton pair momentum ) represents light quarks ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 denotes any heavy quark ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 are the heavy and light pseudoscalar ( vector ) meson masses , respectively . in hqeft , the leading order matrix elements in the @xmath7 expansion can be simply expressed as the following trace formulae @xcite @xmath26 , \\\\ \\label{parinhqet2 } \\langle v(p,\\epsilon^*)|\\bar{q } \\gamma { q_v^{+}}|m_v \\rangle & = & -i \\mbox{tr}[\\omega(v , p)\\gamma { \\cal m}_v]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 , \\\\ \\label{pari2 }   \\omega(v , p)&=&l_1(v\\cdot p ) { \\epsilon\\hspace{-0.2cm}\\slash}^ *     + l_2 ( v\\cdot p ) ( v\\cdot \\epsilon^ * ) + [ l_3(v\\cdot p )      { \\epsilon\\hspace{-0.2cm}\\slash}^ * + l_4(v\\cdot p ) ( v\\cdot \\epsilon^ * ) ]     { \\hat{p}\\hspace{-0.2cm}\\slash},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",

    "correspondingly @xmath32 is the effective heavy meson state .",
    "it is related to the heavy meson state @xmath15 in eqs.([fdefa ] ) and ( [ fdefb ] ) by the normalization of the hadronic matrix elements @xcite : @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 in eqs.([parinhqet1 ] ) , ( [ parinhqet2 ] ) is the heavy pseudoscalar spin wave function in the hqeft @xcite , @xmath36 which exhibits a manifest heavy flavor symmetry . here",
    "@xmath37 is the heavy flavor independent binding energy .    the relations between the form factors defined in eqs.([fdefa ] ) ,",
    "( [ fdefb ] ) and the universal wave functions defined in eqs.([parinhqet1])-([pari2 ] ) can be derived straightforwardly .",
    "one has @xmath38    note that the form factors introduced in eqs.([fdefa ] ) , ( [ fdefb ] ) are heavy flavor dependent .",
    "but the functions @xmath39 , @xmath0 and @xmath40 in eqs.([pari1 ] ) , ( [ pari2 ] ) are leading order wave functions in the @xmath7 expansion , so they should be ( at least explicitly ) independent of the heavy quark mass .",
    "an advantage using the effective field theory of heavy quark is that it enables one to formulate wave functions conveniently in such a heavy quark mass independent way .",
    "when the wave functions @xmath39 , @xmath0 and @xmath41 are estimated to a relatively precise extent , then the form factors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath14 for different decay channels can be easily obtained by adopting the relevant parameters such as masses and binding energies of the mesons . in other words ,",
    "eqs.([aandl1])-([aandl5 ] ) show the relations among different decays . from this point of view , considering the whole group of heavy to light semileptonic decays , one can say that to certain order of the @xmath7 expansion , the hqs and hqe simplify the theoretical analysis and reduce the number of independent functions , though it is well known that for an individual decay the number of independent functions does not decrease .    in light cone sum rule analysis ,",
    "the wave functions are explored from the study of appropriate two point correlation functions .",
    "for example , for decays into pseudoscalar and vector light mesons , using the interpolating current @xmath45 for the pseudoscalar heavy mesons , one may consider the functions : @xmath46 in applying for the sum rule method , on the phenomenological considerations , a complete set of states with the heavy meson quantum numbers are inserted into the above two point functions , i.e. , between the two currents .",
    "for the insertion of the ground states of heavy mesons , one obtains meson pole contributions . while for the insertion of higher resonances",
    ", the results are generally written in the form of integrals over physical densities @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the resulting formulae ,",
    "the matrix elements can be expanded in powers of @xmath7 in the effective theory . in this paper",
    "we consider only the leading order contributions in the heavy quark expansion .",
    "similar to refs.@xcite , we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the scaled decay constant of the heavy meson at the leading order of @xmath7@xcite .",
    "note that when studying @xmath51 decay in @xcite , there is an overall factor @xmath52 multiplied to the meson pole contribution .",
    "though such a factor can be obtained in the effective field theory , it can be written in the form @xmath53 . since we want eqs.([phen1 ] ) and ( [ phen2 ] ) represent only the leading order contribution in heavy quark expansion , it is consistent to miss the factor @xmath54 here .",
    "this change may enlarge the @xmath55 decay form factors obtained in @xcite by the same ratio , as can be seen in the next section .",
    "heavy quark expansion can be performed to the correlators ( [ correlator1 ] ) , ( [ correlator2 ] ) in the framework of effective theory , after which the field variables and meson states can be replaced by their counterparts in effective theory , and those correlators turns into @xmath56    we will include for light pseudoscalar and vector mesons the distribution amplitudes up to the same order as in refs.@xcite . in other words ,",

    "<S> we present a general study on exclusive semileptonic decays of heavy ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) to light ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) mesons in the framework of effective field theory of heavy quark . </S>",
    "<S> transition matrix elements of these decays can be systematically characterized by a set of wave functions which are independent of the heavy quark mass except for the implicit scale dependence . </S>",
    "<S> form factors for all these decays are calculated consistently within the effective theory framework using the light cone sum rule method at the leading order of @xmath7 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratios of these decays are evaluated , and the heavy and light flavor symmetry breaking effects are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we also give comparison of our results and the predictions from other approaches , among which are the relations proposed recently in the framework of large energy effective theory .    # </S>"
