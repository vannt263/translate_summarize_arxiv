    "the phenomenon of entanglement @xcite is a remarkable feature of quantum physics that has been identified as a key ingredient in many areas of quantum information theory including quantum key distribution @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and teleportation @xcite .",
    "however the general problem of how to quantify @xcite the level of entanglement in an arbitrary multipartite system remains unresolved .",
    "there has been some progress towards a solution @xcite , but the task at hand is generally considered a difficult one and may never be completed . we are thus lead to consider simple computable measures of entanglement @xcite that although can not fully characterize the multipartite nature of the correlations , may nevertheless still provide a useful gauge of their levels .    in this article",
    "we investigate the average bipartite entanglement , over all possible divisions of a multipartite system , as a useful measure of multipartite entanglement .",
    "such measures might be considered the least sophisticated of choices ; however , their simplicity allows theoretical calculations to be exercised with ease . we will restrict our study to pure - state entanglement where the subsystem linear entropy is a clear choice for the bipartite measure .",
    "it was recently shown by brennen @xcite that an entanglement measure proposed by meyer and wallach @xcite is of the above described form , and hence , the multipartite entanglement measures considered in this paper may be viewed as generalizations of the meyer - wallach measure .",
    "our measures may also be viewed as variations of those considered by pope and milburn @xcite where instead the minimum bipartite entanglement was considered .",
    "we show that the average bipartite entanglement elects self - dual quantum - error - correcting codes to the status of maximally entangled states .",
    "the connection between entanglement and quantum - error - correcting codes has been highlighted elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) ; however we make this relationship explicit by expressing the average entanglement of encoded states in terms of the weight distribution of the code .",
    "we also investigate the multipartite entangling power of quantum evolutions . a simple extension of the work of zanardi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite allows the derivation of an explicit formula .",
    "such formulae are relevant to current studies in the entangling capabilities of chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "an example treated in this article is the quantum kicked rotor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the meyer - wallach entanglement measure and its generalizations .",
    "the connection between these measures and quantum - error - correcting codes is discussed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "this relationship is further strengthened in section [ sec4 ] where we derive a formula for the average entanglement over a subspace . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we derive a formula for the multipartite entangling power of an arbitrary unitary . finally in section [ sec6 ] we conclude by applying our results to the quantum kicked rotor .",
    "it is generally accepted that when a bipartite quantum system is in an overall pure state , there is an essentially unique resource - based measure of entanglement between the two subsystems .",
    "this measure is given by the von neumann entropy of the marginal density operators @xcite .",
    "to ease theoretical calculations , one often replaces the von neumann entropy with its linearized version , the linear entropy . for a bipartite system in an overall pure state @xmath0 , the _ subsystem linear entropy _",
    "is defined as @xmath1 where the normalization factor , @xmath2 with @xmath3 , is chosen such that @xmath4 .",
    "the state is separable if and only if @xmath5 , and maximally entangled when @xmath6 .    in general , as the number of subsystems increases , an exponential number of independent measures is needed to quantify fully the amount entanglement in a multipartite system .",
    "consequently , the following entanglement measures can not be thought of as unique .",
    "different measures will capture different aspects of multipartite entanglement .",
    "the meyer - wallach measure @xcite , @xmath7 , which can only be applied to multi - qubit pure states @xmath8 , is defined as follows . for each @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we define the linear map @xmath11 through its action on the product basis , @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the meyer - wallach entanglement measure is then @xmath14 where @xmath15 meyer and wallach showed that @xmath16 is invariant under local unitary transformations and that @xmath17 , with @xmath18 if and only if @xmath19 is a product state .",
    "recently , it was shown by brennen @xcite that @xmath16 is simply the average subsystem linear entropy of the constituent qubits : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the density operator for the @xmath22-th qubit after tracing out the rest .",
    "this simplification is easily understood @xcite by first showing that @xmath23 is unchanged by a local unitary applied to the @xmath24-th qubit ( a fact already proven by meyer and wallach ) , and hence , invariant under a change in the qubit s fiducial basis .",
    "consequently , a judicious choice of the schmidt basis gives @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the schmidt coefficients in the decomposition between the @xmath24-th qubit and the remainder of the system .",
    "brennen s simplification immediately allows the generalization of @xmath16 to multi - qudit states @xmath28 , and by considering all other possible bipartite divisions , we can now define a class of related multipartite entanglement measures in the obvious manner : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the density operator for the qudits @xmath32 after tracing out the rest .",
    "note that @xmath33 reduces to the original meyer - wallach measure when @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the above `` multipartite '' entanglement measures are merely averages over the well - established bipartite measure .",
    "consequently , @xmath33 is invariant under local unitary transformations , nonincreasing on average under local quantum operations and classical communication i.e. @xmath33 is an entanglement monotone @xcite , and @xmath36 .",
    "the lower bound is only reached for product states .",
    "+ * proposition 1 : * @xmath37 for some @xmath38 i.e. @xmath39 is a product state .",
    "+ when @xmath34 the upper bound is reached by the generalized ghz states @xmath40 in general @xmath41 and hence , the entangled states @xmath42 do not saturate the upper bound for @xmath43 .",
    "we have not , however , established whether or not there even _ exist _ states which saturate the upper bound .",
    "define an _",
    "@xmath44-uniform _ multi - qudit state to be a state with the property that after tracing out all but @xmath44 qudits we are left with the maximally mixed state , for any @xmath44-tuple of qudits .",
    "thus , all information about the system is lost upon the removal of @xmath45 or more parties .",
    "+ * proposition 2 : * @xmath46 whenever @xmath47 i.e. @xmath39 is @xmath44-uniform .",
    "+ obviously , if @xmath39 is @xmath44-uniform then it is also @xmath48-uniform , and hence , @xmath49 .",
    "however , note that the measures @xmath33 do not obey any ordering .",
    "for example , in the case of qubits , consider the generalized w - states @xmath50 one can calculate @xmath51 and hence , for @xmath52 say , @xmath53 .",
    "the measures @xmath33 also do not preserve the partial ordering of entangled states i.e. @xmath54 does not necessarily imply that @xmath55 for other @xmath44 .",
    "these facts might be considered as unlucky properties of @xmath33 .",
    "however they do suggest that the extremal entanglement measure @xmath56 does not necessarily tell the entire story ; different @xmath33 capture different aspects of multipartite entanglement .",
    "the original meyer - wallach measure @xmath57 is the average entanglement between individual qudits and the rest , whereas , on increasing @xmath44 , @xmath33 measures the average entanglement between blocks of qudits , of an increasing size , and the rest .",
    "consequently , as @xmath44 increases , we expect that @xmath33 will be sensitive to correlations of an increasingly global nature .",
    "proposition 2 implies that the task of finding states which saturate the the upper bound 1 of @xmath33 is equivalent to the construction of @xmath44-uniform multi - qudit states .",
    "we now show in the next section how quantum - error - correcting codes ( qecc s ) produce @xmath44-uniform multi - qudit states .",
    "an example is the six - qubit hexacode state @xmath58 , which arises as the code subspace of the self - dual qubit stabilizer code @xmath59 $ ] . in this case @xmath60 .",
    "the idea behind quantum error correction @xcite is to encode quantum states into qudits in such a way that a small number of errors affecting the individual qudits can be measured and corrected to perfectly restore the original encoded state .",
    "the encoding of a @xmath61-dimensional quantum state into @xmath62 qudits is simply a linear map from @xmath63 to a subspace @xmath64 of @xmath65 .",
    "the subspace itself is referred to as the _ code _ and is orientated in such a way that errors on the qudits move encoded states in a direction perpendicular to the code .      an _ error operator _",
    "@xmath66 is a linear operator acting on @xmath65 .",
    "the error is said to be _",
    "detectable _ by the quantum code @xmath64 if @xmath67 for all normalized @xmath68 .",
    "equivalently , if @xmath64 is spanned by an orthonormal _ logical basis _",
    "@xmath69 , then an error @xmath66 is detectable if and only if @xmath70 for all @xmath71 where the constant @xmath72 depends only on @xmath66 .",
    "it is a general theorem of qecc s that a set of errors @xmath73 can be _ corrected _ by a code @xmath64 , if and only if for each @xmath74 , the error @xmath75 is detectable by @xmath64 .",
    "a _ local error operator _ has the form @xmath76 where each @xmath77 acts on @xmath78 .",
    "the _ weight _ of a local error operator @xmath66 , denoted by @xmath79 , is the number of elements @xmath77 which are not scalar multiples of the identity .",
    "a quantum code @xmath64 has a _ minimum distance _ of at least @xmath80 if and only if all local error operators of weight less than @xmath80 are detectable by @xmath64 .",
    "a code with minimum distance @xmath81 allows the correction of arbitrary errors affecting up to @xmath82 qudits . in the case of qubits ,",
    "such codes are denoted by the triple @xmath83 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath84 for the general case of qudits @xcite .",
    "an @xmath84 code is called _ pure _ if @xmath85 for all @xmath86 whenever @xmath87 .",
    "when considering self - dual codes ( @xmath88 ) , we adopt the convention that the notation @xmath89 refers only to pure codes since the condition on the minimum distance is otherwise trivial .",
    "there is a continuum of possible errors in a single qudit ; however , due to the phenomenon of measurement collapse , the correction of an arbitrary single - qudit error only requires an ability to correct @xmath90 different types , each corresponding to an orthonormal basis element for single - qudit operations .",

    "the weight of @xmath100 is simply the number of pairs @xmath101 different from @xmath102 .",
