    "the intensive study of this area was pioneered by erds and szemerdi in their celebrated paper @xcite from 1983 , studying sum - products over the integers .",

    "@xcite improved the bound on @xmath16 for sums and products over @xmath23 to @xmath24 and finally to @xmath25 . for more details on this problem and related results , cf .",
    "@xcite as well as @xcite and the references therein .",
    "different variants of the sum - product problem were the focus of extensive research in the past decade , with numerous applications in analysis , combinatorics , computer science , geometry , group theory .",
    "most notable is the version of the sum - product theorem for finite fields @xcite , where one must add a restriction that @xmath26 is not too large ( e.g. , almost all of @xmath27 ) nor too small ( e.g. , a subfield of @xmath27 ) .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for further information on sum - product theorems over finite fields and their applications , and also @xcite for such theorems over more general rings .      in their aforementioned paper @xcite ,",
    "erds and szemerdi introduced the following generalization of the sum - product problem , where an underlying geometry ( in the form of a graph on @xmath0 labeled vertices ) restricts the set of the pairs used to produce the sums and products .",
    "formally , we let the sum - product with respect to a ring @xmath9 be the following graph parameter :    let @xmath28 be a graph . given @xmath29 , an injective map of @xmath30 into some ring @xmath9 , define the sum - set @xmath31 and the product - set @xmath32 as follows : @xmath33 the _ sum - product _ of @xmath3 over @xmath9 , denoted by _",
    "@xmath34 _ , is the smallest possible value of over all injections @xmath35 .    in other words ,",
    "each ordered set @xmath36 of cardinality @xmath37 is associated with a sum - set and a product - set according to @xmath3 as follows : the elements of @xmath8 correspond to the vertices , and we only consider sums and products along the edges .",
    "thus the original sum - product problem of erds - szemerdi corresponds to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the complete graph on @xmath0 vertices .    in the above notation , erds and szemerdi",
    "conjectured the following :    for all @xmath40 and every sufficiently large @xmath0 , if @xmath28 is a graph on @xmath0 vertices satisfying @xmath41 then @xmath42    erds and szemerdi note that the above conjecture is likely to hold also over the reals .",
    "however , for sparse graphs ( graphs that contain @xmath43 edges ) there is a fundamental difference between the sum - product behavior over the integers and the reals .",
    "as stated in @xcite , erds had originally thought that also holds when @xmath3 is a graph on @xmath0 vertices with at least @xmath44 edges for some @xmath45 .",
    "it was then shown by a.  rubin that the analogue of for sparse graphs does not hold over @xmath23 , yet the question of whether or not it holds over @xmath46 remains open .",
    "see @xcite , where the author relates this question of erds to a famous conjecture of w.  rudin @xcite .",
    "clearly , for any ring @xmath9 and graph @xmath28 we have that @xmath47 .",
    "we will mostly be interested in a choice of either @xmath46 or @xmath23 for the ring @xmath9 , and as we later state , these satisfy @xmath48 thus , when @xmath3 is a sparse graph with @xmath0 edges , the order of @xmath49 is between @xmath50 and @xmath0 .",
    "our main focus in this paper is the case where @xmath3 is a matching , i.e. , a graph consisting of disjoint edges .",
    "the sum - product problem corresponding to this graph over the integers is already challenging , and as the next theorem demonstrates , it has an immediate implication for the original erds - szemerdi problem :    [ thm - kn - reduction ] let @xmath51 be a matching of size @xmath0 .",
    "the following holds : @xmath52 in particular , if the sum - product of @xmath51 over @xmath46 is @xmath53 for some @xmath54 , then every @xmath0-element subset @xmath14 satisfies @xmath55 .",
    "note that translates any nontrivial lower bound in the sparse setting to one for the dense setting .",
    "in particular , the best - possible lower bound of @xmath56 for a matching of size @xmath0 would imply that @xmath57 , improving upon the currently best known bound of @xmath58 . moreover , points out a relation between the upper bounds in these two settings : just as in the sum - product problem for the complete graph , the @xmath16 in the upper bound of @xmath59 for the sum - product of a matching is essential .",
    "our next main result reduces the problem of obtaining a lower bound on @xmath60 , the sum - product of a matching over the integers , to bounding the maximum possible number of translates of a set of integers into the set of perfect squares , denoted by @xmath61 .",

    "<S> in their seminal paper from 1983 , erds and szemerdi showed that any @xmath0 distinct integers induce either @xmath1 distinct sums of pairs or that many distinct products , and conjectured a lower bound of @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> they conjectured a version of the sum - product theorem for general graphs that have at least @xmath1 edges .    in this work , we consider sum - product theorems for sparse graphs , and show that this problem has important consequences already when @xmath3 is a matching ( i.e. , @xmath4 disjoint edges ) : any lower bound of the form @xmath5 for its sum - product over the integers implies a lower bound of @xmath6 for the original erds - szemerdi problem .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , over the reals the minimal sum - product for the matching is @xmath7 , hence this approach has the potential of achieving lower bounds specialized to the integers . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to give lower and upper bounds for this problem in different settings . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we provide tight bounds for sums along expanders .    a key element in our proofs is a reduction from the sum - product of a matching to the maximum number of translates of a set of integers into the perfect squares . </S>",
    "<S> this problem was originally studied by euler , and we obtain a stronger form of euler s result using elliptic curve analysis . </S>"
