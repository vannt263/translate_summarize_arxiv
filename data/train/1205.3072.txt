    "spatially localized patterns of persistent neural activity ( bumps ) are well studied phenomena thought to subserve a variety of processes in the brain @xcite . working ( short term ) memory tasks are the best known examples of brain functions that may exploit the fact that bumps are localized in feature or physical space @xcite . for example , in oculomotor delayed - response tasks , monkeys preserve knowledge of a visual cue location using prefrontal cortical neurons with elevated activity that is correspondingly tuned to the cue location for the duration of the delay @xcite . there has been a great deal of discussion concerning the relative role of various classes of prefrontal cortical neurons in maintaining persistent activity @xcite .",
    "one strongly supported claim is that slow recurrent excitation is the operant synaptic mechanism for preserving this localized activity during the retention period @xcite .",
    "experimentalists have suggested that prefrontal cortical circuitry consisting of local recurrent excitation and lateral inhibition may underlie the formation of the observed tuning of neurons to particular cue locations @xcite .",
    "networks with such synaptic architecture have long been studied as a theoretical framework for neural pattern formation , with seminal studies of spatially extended neural fields carried out by wilson and cowan @xcite and amari @xcite .",
    "a distinct advantage of such networks is that they display bistability , where stable spatially localized bumps can coexist with a spatially homogeneous  off \" state .",
    "another common feature of these models is that they tend to be ( continuously ) translationally symmetric , since they are spatially continuous dynamical system whose symmetry is preserved under reflections and arbitrary translations @xcite .",
    "stationary localized bump solutions arising in these models have been used as theoretical descriptions of tuning to visual input @xcite , head direction @xcite , and working memory @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrate that neural field models are a useful tool for understanding the dynamical mechanisms necessary to sustain the neural substrates of a variety of sensory and motor processes .",
    "since stationary bumps are an idealized description of encoding location in networks representing feature space , many neural field studies have examined more deeply how model modifications affect the dynamics of bump solutions @xcite .",
    "many studies have also probed the effects of persistent inputs on the dynamics of neural fields with feedback inhibition @xcite . for sufficiently strong inhibition",
    ", networks can generate spontaneous traveling waves so activity fails to lock to stationary @xcite or traveling @xcite inputs .",
    "this can lead to breathing instabilities where the activity pattern oscillates regularly @xcite .",
    "axonal delays can also substantially alter the dynamics of bumps in models with lateral inhibition , leading to multibumps @xcite , oscillatory bumps @xcite , and anti - pulses @xcite .",
    "multibump solutions can also be generated by introducing synaptic connectivity that is oscillatory in space @xcite .",
    "aside from the connectivity function , the form of the firing rate function , which converts local synaptic inputs to an output firing rate , can also affect the shape and stability of stationary bumps @xcite .",
    "many studies of bumps have also explored the effect of auxiliary negative feedback variables like spike frequency adaptation @xcite or synaptic depression @xcite .",
    "substantially strong negative feedback can lead either a drift instability , where the bump propagates as a traveling pulse @xcite , or a breathing instability , where the edges of the bump oscillate their position in time @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that an auxiliary synaptic facilitation variable can serve to curtail the tendency of bumps in neural fields with heterogeneous connectivity to wander @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a veritable wealth of dynamic instabilities of bumps that have been examined in deterministic neural fields .    beyond these studies ,",
    "there have been several analyses of spiking neuron models of stationary bumps @xcite .",
    "spiking models have the advantage of capturing finer timescale dynamics , for example spike time synchrony , than those of which neural fields are capable .",
    "another major difference is that spiking models are often chaotic , leading to dynamics that can appear random .",
    "this is much more akin to the environment of networks of neurons in the brain , seething with fluctuations . as a result , a basic behavior that has been revealed in numerical simulations of bumps in spiking networks is wandering of the bump s mean position @xcite .",
    "there has been very limited investigation of such dynamics in neural field equations @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in both spiking models and neural fields with noise , the variance of the bump s position scales linearly with time , suggesting the position as a function of time behaves as a purely diffusive process @xcite .",
    "this is due in part to these system often being translationally symmetric @xcite . while this symmetry allow bumps to be initially nucleated at any point in the network , an inherent marginal stability makes it so that bumps are never firmly pinned to any particular location over time @xcite",
    "thus , bump position is fragile to noise and as well as perturbations of the evolution equations of the underlying dynamical system , which itself contains a line attractor .    the fact that bumps in noisy models of working memory wander should be no surprise , in light of existing data concerning the dependence of recall error on delay time @xcite . in spite of the relatively reliable correspondence between the elevation of neural activity and the cue location in prefrontal cortical networks @xcite",
    ", there is inevitably some error made in reporting the original cue location @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude of this error scales linearly in time @xcite , suggesting that it may be generated by some underlying diffusive process .",
    "thus , for a network to have improve memory storage accuracy , it should reduce the effects of this diffusion as much as possible .",
    "this invites the question of how networks for working memory may exploit dynamics that are close to line attractors to improve memory recall accuracy .",
    "some computational studies have suggested that relaxing the translation symmetry of line attractors by introducing multiple discrete attractors may make dynamics more resilient @xcite .",
    "however , others have viewed spatial heterogeneity in networks as a detriment to working memory that must be overcome @xcite . therefore , to make the theory of bump attractors for working memory more robust",
    ", we must consider the effects of noise and network heterogeneity and any new phenomena they bring .",
    "we propose to perform an in depth analysis of the diffusion of stationary bump solutions in neural field equations with noise . in doing so",
    ", we wish to understand how parameters of the model affect the degradation of the bump s initial position . since oculomotor delayed - response tasks usually require recalling the location of an object on a circle , this suggests using a neural field model whose spatial domain is finite and periodic @xcite .",
    "thus , to accompany our analysis of stochastic neural fields , we will review and extend some of the results for bump existence and stability in the deterministic ring model @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the total synaptic input to spatial location @xmath2 $ ] at time @xmath3 .",
    "a variation of this model , that includes spatially varying inputs , is examined in section [ input ] .",
    "the integral term represents synaptic feedback from the entirety of the network so that the kernel @xmath4 encodes the strength of connections from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "in many studies of the ring model , @xmath7 so the network is spatially homogeneous @xcite . in particular , using the cosine weight kernel @xmath8 makes the equation ( [ ring ] ) translationally symmetric in space and amenable to explicit analysis .",
    "we study bump solutions that arise in the case of homogeneous synaptic weights extensively in section [ bump1 ] .",
    "however , we also study the effect of spatially heterogeneous synaptic connections in section [ inhom ] , so that @xmath9 particularly , we analyze ( [ ring ] ) when @xmath10 which provides spatially heterogeneous , yet periodic , synaptic modulation whose frequency is set by the @xmath11 . spatial heterogeneities in the weight functions of neural fields",
    "have been shown to lead to multibump solutions @xcite and to alter traveling waves @xcite . in section [ inhom ] ,",
    "we study how periodic heterogeneities affect the stability and evolution of bumps in the presence of noise .",
    "the nonlinearity @xmath12 is a firing rate function which converts synaptic inputs @xmath13 to a resulting fraction of active neurons , between zero and one by definition . in line with experimental observations ,",
    "this is often taken to be a sigmoidal function @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gain and @xmath16 is the threshold .",
    "we can perform much of our analysis for a general firing rate function @xmath12 , such as the sigmoid ( [ sig ] ) .",
    "however , one particular idealization that eases mathematical analysis considers the infinite gain @xmath17 limit , so that ( [ sig ] ) becomes a heaviside step function @xcite @xmath18 the heaviside firing rate function ( [ h ] ) allows us to explicitly calculate many quantities of interest in our study .",
    "as mentioned , the deterministic neural field equation ( [ ring ] ) has been studied extensively as a model of neural pattern formation @xcite .",
    "the main interest of this paper is to consider effects of fluctuations on stationary bump solutions of ( [ ring ] ) .",
    "in particular , we will consider the general case where noise can depend multiplicatively on the state variable @xmath13 .",
    "thus , we have the following langevin equation that describes a noisy neural field @xmath19 { { \\rm d}}t + { \\varepsilon}^{1/2 } g({{\\mathcal u}}(x , t ) ) { { \\rm d}}w ( x , t ) , \\label{ringlang}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 tracks the sum of synaptic inputs at position @xmath21 at time @xmath3 .",
    "the term @xmath22 is the increment of a spatially dependent wiener process such that @xmath23 so that @xmath24 determines the noise amplitude , which is weak ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "spatial correlations of the noise are described by the function @xmath26 , which is symmetric and depends on the distance between two spatial locations in the network .",
    "the function @xmath27 , describing the multiplicative noise , can be specified arbitrarily in a great deal of our analysis .",
    "models such as ( [ ringlang ] ) have been recently introduced as stochastic versions of neural field equations @xcite .",
    "note that we can also examine the effects of additive noise in the framework ( [ ringlang ] ) by simply taking the function @xmath28 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ bump1 ] we study the effects of noise on bump solutions of the ring network ( [ ring ] ) with spatially homogeneous synaptic weights @xmath29 .",
    "since bumps have a zero eigenvalue associated with their linear stability , indicating marginal stability and translation symmetry , the introduction of noise in the langevin equation ( [ ringlang ] ) leads to their wandering as a purely diffusive process .",
    "we compute the effective diffusion coefficient of this process as well as a shift in the mean width of the bump due to the multiplicative noise .",
    "we examine the effects of spatially dependent inputs in section [ input ] .",
    "since , in this case , the network will no longer be ( continuously ) translationally symmetric , stable bumps are linearly stable to perturbations of their mean position . introducing noise then leads to their position evolving as a mean - reverting stochastic process , rather than a purely diffusive one .",
    "however , on exponentially long time scales , the bump can escape from the position to which they are pinned so they move to the vicinity of another discrete attractor of the deterministic system . in section [ inhom ]",
    ", we introduce spatially periodic heterogeneities into the weight function so that bumps still exist , but calculation of their stability reveals there is no longer a generic zero eigenvalue , once again reflecting the loss of translation symmetry . as in the case of external inputs ,",
    "this leads to pinning of bumps to a finite number of discrete attractors in the stochastic system ( [ ringlang ] ) so their position evolves as a mean - reverting process .",
    "even though bumps can escape from these pinned positions , they ultimately wander with a smaller effective diffusion coefficient than in the spatially homogeneous network .",
    "we begin by studying bumps in a spatially homogeneous ring model ( @xmath7 ) , first in the absence of noise ( [ ring ] ) and then with multiplicative noise ( [ ringlang ] ) .",
    "previous studies of traveling fronts in reaction diffusion equations and neural fields have found multiplicative noise can alter the mean speed of the front and causes the front to wander diffusively @xcite . analyzing ( [ ringlang ] )",
    "reveals that multiplicative noise leads to dynamics whose mean is given by a bump with a position that wanders diffusively .",
    "our analysis allows us to approximate the diffusion coefficient of the bump , estimating the error a network may make in a working memory task that relies on the position of the bump center @xcite .      to begin",
    ", we derive stationary bump solutions . as opposed to the method of construction of amari @xcite , we need not presume a heaviside firing rate function ( [ h ] ) to derive explicit bump solutions .",
    "we exploit the fact that the cosine weight function ( [ cos ] ) is separable through a trigonometric identity to reduce the existence and stability problems to root - finding problems or linear algebraic systems @xcite .    upon assuming a stationary solution @xmath30 , the scalar equation ( [ ring ] ) with a spatially homogeneous weight function @xmath31 requires that it satisfy the integral equation @xmath32 for the weight function ( [ cos ] )",
    ", we can employ the trigonometric identity @xmath33 so that ( [ bumpwf ] ) becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 we look specifically for even symmetric stationary bump solutions , as is often done in analyses of localized solutions in neural fields @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath36 , so @xmath37 and we can solve for @xmath38 by requiring self consistency of the solution @xmath39 such that ( [ bumpa ] ) becomes @xmath40 for a general sigmoidal firing rate function ( [ sig ] ) , one could determine @xmath38 using a numerical root finding method .",
    "for a heaviside firing rate function ( [ h ] ) , we can solve exactly for the amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "equation ( [ bsola ] ) shows @xmath41 is unimodal and symmetric , so it will cross above and below @xmath16 at locations @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "this provides us with the threshold conditions @xmath44 for ( [ bsola ] ) , which can be written equivalently as @xmath45 thus , we know @xmath46 for @xmath47 , so the self - consistency condition ( [ baselfcon ] ) becomes @xmath48 solving ( [ baheav ] ) for the bump scaling factor @xmath49 reveals there are two bump solutions @xmath50 and we can show that the wide solution ( @xmath51 ) is stable and the narrow solution ( @xmath52 ) is unstable , forming a separatrix between the wide bump and the rest state @xmath53 . applying ( [ wid1beqn ] ) , half - widths @xmath54 , can be easily computed @xmath55 as we have mentioned , the network with a cosine weight kernel ( [ cos ] ) is translationally symmetric , so that we could construct a bump solution centered at any position @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this would simply lead to a system of two equations for @xmath38 and @xmath57 associated with ( [ ubumpab ] ) , but the width of such a bump would be the same as that of ( [ bsola ] ) .",
    "we can also show this by calculating the linear stability of bumps in the network ( [ ring ] ) , revealing marginal stability of a shift perturbation .",
    "this we do now for the case of a general firing rate function @xmath12 .",
    "linear stability of bumps ( [ bsola ] ) can be computed by analyzing the evolution of small , smooth , separable perturbations such that @xmath58 for @xmath59 . plugging this expansion into the evolution equation ( [ ring ] ) , taylor expanding , applying ( [ bumpwf ] ) , and studying first order equation yields @xcite @xmath60 for the cosine weight function ( [ cos ] ) , we can apply the identity ( [ cosid ] ) so that @xmath61 where @xmath62 thus , we reduce the infinite dimensional equation ( [ evalb1 ] ) to a @xmath63 linear spectral problem ( [ beigcon ] ) .",
    "such a technique was recently shown for a general class of weight functions in @xcite . plugging the form of @xmath64 given by ( [ beigcon ] ) into the system of equations ( [ beig ] )",
    ", we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 first of all , note that the essential spectrum is @xmath67 and thus does not contribute to any instabilities . upon integrating ( [ baselfcon ] ) by parts , we see @xmath68 therefore",
    ", as long as @xmath69 , the equality ( [ sin2fpid ] ) tells us @xmath70 using this identity ( [ sin2id ] ) and the fact that ( [ bintfp ] ) is linear , we can then compute @xmath71 finally , we can use integration by parts to show @xmath72 since @xmath41 is even . using the identities ( [ sin2id ] ) , ( [ icosid ] ) , and ( [ csfpid ] ) , it is straightforward to compute the eigenvalues that determine the stability of the bump ( [ bsola ] ) .",
    "we do so by finding the roots of the associated characteristic equation @xmath73 which reveals the zero eigenvalue @xmath74 , associated with the constant @xmath75 , defined in ( [ beig ] ) , which means it reveals the linear stability of bumps in response to odd ( shifting ) perturbations . the fact that @xmath76 is zero arises due to the underlying translation symmetry of ( [ ring ] ) when @xmath4 is the cosine weight function ( [ cos ] ) .",
    "in addition , the stability of the bump ( [ bsola ] ) is determined by the sign of the other eigenvalue @xmath77 associated with @xmath78 , defined by ( [ beig ] ) , and thus even ( expanding or contracting ) perturbations of the bump .    in the limit of infinite gain @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath12 becomes the heaviside ( [ h ] ) , and @xmath79 in the sense of distributions , so the formula for the generically nonzero eigenvalue will be @xmath80 for the bump ( [ bdetsol ] ) of half - width @xmath54 . identifying threshold @xmath16 values at which ( [ hevbump ] ) crosses zero will give the location of a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ hevbump ] ) allows us to compute eigenvalues exactly for the wide and narrow bumps since ( [ b1widths ] ) gives the half - widths and the spatial derivative at the edges @xmath81 plugging the expression ( [ upabump ] ) into ( [ hevbump ] ) yields @xmath82 the nonzero eigenvalue associated with the wide ( @xmath51 ) and narrow ( @xmath52 ) bump . to identify the threshold @xmath16 where the two pulses annihilate in a saddle - node bifurcation",
    ", we look for where @xmath83 . imposing this requirement on ( [ wdnarevbump ] ) means",
    "@xmath84 it can be shown that ( [ hbsn1 ] ) is equivalent to finding zeros of the quartic @xmath85 , whose real solutions are @xmath86 .",
    "thus , as @xmath16 is increased from zero , the stable wide and unstable narrow bump branches will coalesce in a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath87 .",
    "we now consider the effect noise has on bumps by studying approximate solutions to the langevin equation ( [ ringlang ] ) with a spatially homogeneous weight function @xmath7 .",
    "the primary behavior in which we are interested is how the bump s position changes .",
    "wandering of bumps was first observed numerically in modeling studies of working memory that employed rate @xcite and spiking models @xcite .",
    "these authors rightly observed that such pure diffusion was due to the potential landscape of the deterministic dynamical system being a line attractor @xcite . in the case of truly multiplicative noise , we show that the mean width of the bump changes changes as well .",
    "mainly , we show that we can use a linear expansion to approximate the influence of spatially correlated multiplicative noise on the position of bumps in a neural field .",
    "this reveals that the bump undergoes pure diffusion whose associated coefficient we can derive from our asymptotic analysis .    the fact that multiplicative noise alters the mean width of the bump arises from the fact that this noise does not have zero mean , @xmath88 .",
    "we can calculate this average using novikov s theorem @xcite @xmath89 one method for deriving the result ( [ novikov ] ) is to fourier transform ( [ ringlang ] ) and evaluate averages using the corresponding fokker - planck equation in fourier space @xcite . rewriting equation ( [ ringlang ] ) using ( [ novikov ] ) , we can formulate the fluctuating term so that it has zero mean @xmath90 { { \\rm d}}t + { \\varepsilon}^{1/2 } { { \\rm d}}z ( { { \\mathcal u } } , x , t ) ,   \\label{rlangzm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 the stochastic process @xmath93 has zero mean and variance @xmath94 next , we assume that the multiplicative noise in ( [ rlangzm ] ) generates two phenomena that occur on disparate time scales . diffusion of the bump from its original position occurs on long timescales , and fluctuations in the bump profile occur on short time scales @xcite .",
    "thus , we express the solution @xmath95 of equation ( [ rlangzm ] ) as the sum of a fixed bump profile @xmath96 displaced by @xmath97 from its",
    "mean position @xmath6 , and higher order time - dependent fluctuations @xmath98 in the profile of the bump @xmath99",
    "so @xmath97 is a stochastic variable indicating the displacement of the bump @xmath96 with slightly altered half - width @xmath100 .",
    "to a linear approximation , the stochastic variable @xmath97 undergoes pure diffusion with associated coefficient @xmath101 , as we show .",
    "the expansion ( [ ringbexp ] ) is not a standard small - noise expansion , since the modified bump @xmath96 implicitly depends upon @xmath24 , where the subscript denotes parametrization . by substituting ( [ ringbexp ] ) into equation ( [ rlangzm ] ) and taking averages",
    ", we find the leading order deterministic equation for @xmath96 is @xmath102 the mean pulse half - width @xmath100 and profile @xmath103 depend non - trivially on the noise strength @xmath24 , since @xmath104 , given by ( [ hfblang ] ) , is @xmath24-dependent .",
    "therefore , the width @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the width of the bump in the absence of multiplicative noise . proceeding to next order , and requiring ( [ langmbump ] ) , we find @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the non - self - adjoint linear operator @xmath111 for any function @xmath112 $ ] .    upon differentiating ( [ langmbump ] ) and integrating the convolution by parts @xmath113",
    "so @xmath114 belongs to the nullspace of @xmath110 .",
    "now , we can ensure a bounded solution to equation ( [ dplangb ] ) exists by requiring the inhomogeneous part is orthogonal to all elements of the nullspace of the adjoint operator @xmath115 .",
