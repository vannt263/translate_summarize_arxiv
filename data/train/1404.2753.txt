    "nowadays , it is generally accepted the existence of the so - called _ pasta phase _",
    "@xcite in the inner crust of a neutron star close to the crust - core transition . constituted by several types of complex structures such as _ e.g. , _ rods and slabs , the pasta phase is a frustrated system formed as a result of the competition between the strong and the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the effect of the density dependence of the symmetry energy on the pasta phase has been discussed in several works @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that for very large values of the symmetry energy slope parameter , @xmath3 , non - spherical structures ( _ e.g. , _ rodlike or slablike ) are not expected in @xmath0-equilibrium matter , and that the number of nucleons in the clusters as well as the cluster proton fraction and the size of the wigner  seitz ( ws ) cell are sensitive to this quantity . it has been also discussed that @xmath1 may have quite dramatic effects on the cell structure if its value is very large or small @xcite .    in the present work the effect of @xmath1 on the size of the inner crust will be discussed within a thomas  fermi ( tf ) formalism in the ws approximation in the framework of relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) nuclear models @xcite .",
    "the tolman ",
    "volkov equations ( tov ) @xcite will be integrated and the size of the inner crust as well as the localization of the pasta structures identified .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that smaller values of @xmath1 favor a wider slab phase and a larger relative size of the inner crust with respect to the total crust , and a steeper crust profile .",
    "we will also study the effect of temperature on the size of the inner crust .",
    "it will be shown that pasta clusters in @xmath0-equilibrium will completely melt for temperatures above 5 - 6 mev .",
    "these results agree partially with the predictions obtained within a dynamical spinodal ( ds ) approach @xcite .",
    "a similar calculation was done with skyrme forces in ref .",
    "the melting of the pasta phase was previously studied in @xcite , were the effect of thermal fluctuations was taken into account .",
    "it is expected that if thermal fluctuations are larger than the radius of the ws cell , the ws approximation breaks down .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations will not be considered in the present calculation and , therefore , the reader must interpret our results just as upper limits .",
    "the existence of non - homogeneous matter will affect the evolution of a supernova or proto - neutron star matter , in particular the diffusion of neutrinos out of the star @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results of the present study have been published in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the formalism is briefly reviewed in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the presentation and discussion of the results while the main conclusions are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "to describe the inner crust in this work we apply the self - consistent tf formalism presented in refs .",
    "we use relativistic mean field nuclear models with constant couplings and non - linear terms  @xcite , and with density dependent couplings  @xcite . within the first class of models , that we will designate by non linear walecka models , we consider the following ones : nl3  @xcite with non linear @xmath4 terms , tm1 @xcite with non linear @xmath4 and @xmath5 terms , nl3@xmath6 including also non - linear @xmath7 terms which allow the modulation of the density dependence of the symmetry energy  @xcite , fsu  @xcite and iu - fsu  @xcite with non - linear @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 terms . within the second class of models with density dependent couplings we consider the models dd - me2  @xcite and dd - me@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the latter , among the parametrizations considered , is the only one including the @xmath8 meson .",
    "all the equations that allow the performance of the tf calculation are derived from the lagrangian density @xmath9 where the nucleon lagrangian reads @xmath10 \\psi _ { i }   \\label{lagnucl},\\ ] ] with @xmath11 and the electron lagrangian is given by @xmath12\\psi_e .",
    "\\label{lage}\\ ] ] the meson and electromagnetic lagrangian densities are @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the four coupling parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the mesons to the nucleons are density dependent in the relativistic density dependent models considered , namely , dd - me2  @xcite and dd - me@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the non - linear term @xmath21 is absent in these models .",
    "in all the other models , nl3  @xcite , tm1 @xcite , nl3@xmath6  @xcite , fsu  @xcite and iu - fsu  @xcite , the couplings are constant and at least some of the non - linear terms of @xmath22 are included . in the above lagrangian density @xmath23",
    "is the isospin operator . for reference ,",
    "we give in table [ tabsat ] the main properties of the above models at saturation density .",
    "we will discuss how sensitive is the structure of the non - homogeneous inner - crust of a neutron star to the properties of the equation of state ( eos ) .    in the tf approximation of non - uniform @xmath24 matter",
    ", fields are assumed to vary slowly so that baryons can be treated as moving in locally constant fields at each point @xcite .",
    "the calculation starts from the grand canonical potential density , @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27 stands for the neutron , proton and electron positive ( negative ) energy distributions , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the total entropy and energy densities , respectively @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the meson fields ( see _ e.g. , _ ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) follow from the variational conditions @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the numerical algorithm for the description of the neutral @xmath24 matter at finite temperature is a generalization of the @xmath32 case which is discussed in detail in refs . @xcite .",
    "the poisson equation is always solved by using the appropriate green s function according to the spatial dimension of interest , and the klein ",
    "gordon equations are solved by expanding the meson fields in a harmonic oscillator basis with one , two or three dimensions based on the method presented in refs .",
    "the interested reader is referred to these works for details of the calculation .",
    ".nuclear matter properties at saturation : density ( @xmath33 ) , energy ( @xmath34 ) , incompressibility ( @xmath35 ) , skewness ( @xmath36 ) , symmetry energy ( @xmath37 ) , and symmetry energy slope parameter ( @xmath1 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         from the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ tcrust ] , we observe that the droplet - rod and the rod - slab transition densities do not depend on the temperature .",
    "however , the melting temperature of the three geometries is different , with the droplets surviving up to higher temperatures .    in the present calculation",
    "we suppose that the ws cells exist until the clusters melt .",
    "this is an approximation that will probably break down close to the melting point due to thermal fluctuations , and therefore , the numbers obtained should be interpreted as an upper limit .",
    "the problem of the effect of thermal fluctuations on the pasta structures has been studied in refs . @xcite and it has been shown that thermally induced displacements of the rodlike and slablike nuclei can melt the lattice structure when these displacements are larger than the space available between the cluster and the boundary of the ws cell . moreover",
    ", it was also shown that slablike nuclei would more easily be dissolved , while the rodlike were expected to survive at temperatures relevant for supernova cores . in the present calculation , except for iu - fsu , all models predict the melting of the slabs at a temperature @xmath38 mev , while the rods will melt at temperatures one mev higher , see table [ tabtra ] . neglecting thermal fluctuations we expect that clusters will survive in @xmath0-equilibrium matter at temperatures below @xmath2 mev , approximately twice the melting temperature of non - droplet structures .",
    "we next analyse the effect of the temperature on the size of the ws cells . in fig .",
    "[ radius ] we plot the ws radius as a function of the temperature for all the models .",
    "we select three reference densities : @xmath392.76 @xmath40 and 2.02 @xmath41 @xmath42 , at which the clusters are spherical for all models , and @xmath43 @xmath42 , where all are in rod phase except iu - fsu , that is in a slab phase . in fig .",
    "[ radiusrho ] we focus on the tm1 model , which only shows spherical clusters , and plot the radius of the ws cell versus density at different temperatures .",
    "in general , for the densities shown , the ws radius increases with the temperature , but for @xmath44 @xmath42 the @xmath45 suffers a small decrease of the order of 0.5 fm below @xmath46 mev .",
    "the surface energy decreases with temperature , and , as a result , we could expect that the wigner seitz radius would decrease with temperature .",
    "this , in fact , occurs for temperatures well below the critical transition temperature to homogeneous matter , corresponding to the behavior below @xmath47 mev in the fig .",
    "[ radius ] middle panel for most of the models considered , or to the iufsu below 7 mev and nl3@xmath7 below 2 mev in the bottom figure .",
    "however , for temperatures close to the critical temperature , the wigner seitz radius increases most probably due to the restrictions of the present calculation which does not allow the freedom for the cluster to choose the shape that minimizes the free energy .",
    "a similar behavior was obtained within a different formalism , namely considering plane - wave density fluctuations and relating the wave number of the unstable modes with the wigner seitz cell size . in @xcite and @xcite , both in the framework of the non - relativistic skyrme interactions and the rmf nuclear models",
    ", the wigner seitz cell increases with the temperature . in this case",
    "the size of the wigner seitz cell is identified with the wave - length of the perturbation , and the cluster size with half - wave length , and the system does not have the freedom to have the size of the cluster and of the cell uncorrelated .",
    "we have performed a calculation of the ws radius within a ds calculation for tm1 and @xmath48 and 1 mev ( thick lines in fig .",
    "[ radiusrho ] ) .",
    "tf and ds give similar sizes for @xmath32 mev at the bottom of the inner crust , where the dynamical calculation predicts non - homogeneous matter .",
    "however , in general the ds predictions are quite different from the tf results , in particular quite smaller at @xmath32 mev and larger at finite @xmath49 .",
    "in the present work the inner crust , including the non - spherical pasta phases , was calculated within a self - consistent thomas ",
    "fermi approach @xcite for @xmath0-equilibrium matter at zero and finite temperature .",
    "several relativistic nuclear models , both with constant and density dependent couplings , have been considered .",
    "all models , except nl3 and tm1 , both with a symmetry energy slope at saturation above 110 mev , predict the existence of _ lasagna_-like structures that may have an important contribution to the specific heat of the crust @xcite .",
    "the effect of the inner crust eos on the neutron star profiles was also analysed .",
    "it was verified that a smaller slope gives rise to a steeper crust density profile and a larger inner crust with respect to the total crust .",
    "it may also enhance the slab phase size as observed in iu - fsu .",
    "it was observed that the star profile obtained using the tf inner crust calculation or the homogeneous eos above the outer - inner crust transition did not differ much except for the models with a large symmetry energy slope .",
    "the finite temperature calculation of the pasta phase in @xmath0-equilibrium has shown that non - homogeneous matter is expected for temperatures below 5 - 6 mev , the only exception was obtained with the parametrization iu - fsu which only melts at 9.5 mev .",
    "non - spherical structures , rodlike and slablike , melt above , respectively , 2 - 3.5 mev and 1 - 3 mev .",
    "it was also verified that the onset density of the rodlike and the slablike structures is independent of the temperature .",
    "finally , it was shown that a ds calculation is able to give a good prediction of the crust - core transition , even at finite temperature . however , considering the size of the ws cells , this formalism fails except for @xmath32 mev close to the crust - core transition .",
