    "if the solar galactic environment is to have a discernible effect on events on the surface of the earth , it must be through a subtle and indirect influence on the terrestrial climate .",
    "the scientific and philosophical literature of the 18th , 19th and 20th centuries all include discussions of possible cosmic influences on the terrestrial climate , including the effect of cometary impacts on earth ( @xcite ) , and the diminished solar radiation from sunspots , which herschel attributed to `` holes '' in the luminous fluid on the surface of the sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of interstellar material in the 20th century led to speculations that encounters with dense clouds initiated the ice ages ( @xcite ) , and many papers appeared that explored the implications of such encounters , including the influence of interstellar material ( ism ) on the interplanetary medium and planetary atmospheres ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ism - modulated heliosphere was also believed to affect climate stability and astrospheres ( e. g. @xcite ) .",

    "the answer to the question posed above lies in an interdisciplinary study of the coupling between the interstellar medium and the solar wind , and the effects that ism variations have on the 1 au environment of the earth through this coupling .",
    "the articles in this book explore different viewpoints , including _",
    "experiments , as well as data - rich summaries of variations in the solar environment and paleoclimate data on cosmic ray flux variations at earth .",

    "the properties of these buffering interactions are evaluated for heliosphere models that have been developed using boundary conditions appropriate for when the sun traverses different types of interstellar clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the consequences of sun - cloud encounters are then discussed in terms of the accretion of ism onto the terrestrial atmosphere for dense cloud encounters , and the possibly extreme variations expected for cosmic ray modulation when interstellar densities vary substantially ( @xcite ) .",

    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows a cartoon of the present - day heliosphere , with labels for the major landmarks such as the termination shock , heliopause , and bow shock .    in the present - day heliosphere ,",

    "the subsonic solar wind region between the termination shock and heliopause is called the inner `` heliosheath '' .",
    "the outer heliosheath lies just beyond the heliopause , where the pristine ism is distorted by the ram pressure of the heliosphere . a bow shock , where the interstellar gas becomes subsonic , is expected to form ahead of the present - day heliosphere in the observed upwind direction of the ism flow through the solar system .    large interstellar dust grains and interstellar atoms that remain neutral inside of the orbit of earth , such as he , are gravitationally focused in the downwind direction .",

    "the heliotail itself extends @xmath1 au from the sun in the downwind direction , forming a cosmic wake for the solar system .    of significance",
    "when considering the interaction of the heliosphere with an interstellar cloud is that neutral particles enter the heliosphere relatively unimpeded , after which they are ionized and convected outwards with the solar wind .",

    "the present - day termination shock appears to be weak , with a solar wind velocity jump ratio ( the ratio of upstream to downstream values ) of @xmath02.6 and a magnetic field compression ratio of @xmath03 .",
    "the magnetic wall that is predicted for the heliosphere ( @xcite , chapter 3 by pogorelov and zank ) appears to have been detected through observations of magnetically aligned dust grains ( @xcite ) , and the offset between upwind directions of interstellar  and  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the compressed and heated  in the hydrogen wall region of the outer heliosheath has now been detected around a number of stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present - day solar wind is the baseline for evaluating the heliosphere response to ism variations in the following articles , so a short review of the solar wind is first presented .",
    "the remaining part of @xmath21.2 introduces the topics in the following articles in terms of the underlying query of the book .",
    "the solar wind originates in the million degree solar corona that expands radially outwards , with a density @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the distance to the sun , and contains both features that corotate with the sun , and transient structures ( e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the solar wind vary with the phase of the solar magnetic activity cycle and with ecliptic latitude .",
    "the best historical indicator of solar magnetic activity levels is the number of sunspots , first detected by galileo in 1610 , which are magnetic storms in the convective zone of the sun .",
    "sunspot numbers indicate that the magnetic activity levels fluctuate with a @xmath011 year cycle , or the `` solar cycle '' , and solar maximum / minimum corresponds to the maximum / minimum of sunspot numbers .",
    "the magnetic polarity of the sun varies with a @xmath022 year cycle . during solar maximum , a low - speed wind , with velocity @xmath0300600  and density @xmath5 particles  at 1 au",
    ", extends over most of the solar disk .",
    "open magnetic field lines700 , solar wind .",
    "] are limited to solar pole regions .",
    "a neutral current sheet @xmath00.4 au thick forms between the solar wind containing negative magnetic polarity fields and the solar wind that contains positive magnetic polarity fields .",
    "the neutral current sheet reaches its largest inclination ( @xmath6 ) during solar maximum . during the conditions of solar minimum , a high speed wind with velocity @xmath0600800  and density @xmath05",
    "is accelerated in the open magnetic flux lines in coronal holes . during mininum ,",
    "the high speed wind and open field lines extend from the polar regions down to latitudes of @xmath7@xmath8(@xcite ) .",
    "the higher solar wind momentum flux associated with solar minimum conditions produces an upwind termination shock that is @xmath0540 au more distant in the upwind direction than during solar maximum conditions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the alignment and strength of the solar magnetic multipoles depend on the phase of the solar cycle ( @xcite ) . during solar minimum conditions ,",
    "the magnetic field is dominated by the dipole and hexapole moments , and the dipole moment is generally aligned with the solar rotation axis .",
    "sunspots migrate from high to low heliographic latitudes .",
    "the magnetic poles follow the coronal holes to the solar equator as solar activity increases . during the solar maximum period ,",
    "the galactic cosmic rays undergo their maximum modulation , the dipole component of the magnetic field is minimized , the quadrapole moment dominates , and the polarity of the solar magnetic field reverses ( @xcite , figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "over historic times , the cosmic ray modulation by the heliosphere correlates better with the open magnetic flux line coverage than with sunspot numbers ( @xcite ) .",
    "variable cosmic ray modulation produced by a variable heliosphere may be a primary factor in both solar and ism forcing of the terrestrial climate .",
    "the heliosphere modulation of cosmic rays is well established .",
    "john simpson , to whom this book is dedicated , initiated a program 5 solar cycles ago in 1951 to monitor cosmic ray fluxes on earth using high - altitude neutron detectors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results show a pronounced anticorrelation between cosmic ray flux levels and solar sunspot numbers , which trace the 11-year schwabe magnetic activity cycle , and which also show that the polarity of the solar magnetic field affects cosmic ray modulation ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the articles in this book show convincingly that the ism also modulates the heliosphere , and the effect of the solar wind on the heliosphere must be differentiated from the influence of interstellar matter .",
    "variations in solar activity levels are also seen over @xmath9 year timescales , such as the absence of sunspots during the maunder minimum in the 17th century .",
    "modern climate records show that the maunder minimum corresponded to extremely cold weather , and radioisotope records show that the flux of cosmic rays was unusually high at this time ( see kirkby and carslaw , chapter 12 ) .",
    "similar effects will occur from the modulation of galactic cosmic rays by the passage of the sun through an interstellar cloud .",
    "these temporal and latitudinal variations in the solar wind momentum flux produce an asymmetric heliosphere , which varies with time .",
    "any possible historical signature of the ism on the heliosphere must first be distinguished from variations driven by the solar wind itself .",
    "the ism forms the boundary conditions of the heliosphere , so that encounters with interstellar clouds will affect the global heliosphere , the interplanetary medium , and the inner heliosphere region where the earth is located .",
    "today an interstellar wind passes through the solar system at 26.3  ( @xcite ) .",
    "an entering parcel of ism takes about 20 years to reach the inner heliosphere , so that ism near the earth is constantly replenished with new inflowing material .",
    "this warm gas is low density and partially ionized , with temperature @xmath106,300 k , and densities of neutral and ionized matter of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "an elementary perspective of the response of the heliosphere to interstellar pressures is given by an analytical expression for the heliopause distance based on the locus of positions where the solar wind ram pressure , @xmath13 , and the total interstellar pressure equilibrate ( @xcite ) .",
    "the solar wind density @xmath14 falls off as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance to the sun , while the velocity @xmath17 is relatively constant . at 1",
    "au the solar wind ram pressure is @xmath18 so the heliosphere distance , @xmath19 , is given by :    @xmath20    the interstellar pressure terms include the magnetic pressure @xmath21 , the thermal , @xmath22 , and the ram , @xmath23 , pressures of the charged gas , and the pressures of dust grains , @xmath24 , and cosmic rays , @xmath25 , which are excluded by heliosphere magnetic fields and plasma .",
    "some interstellar neutrals convert to ions through charge exchange with compressed interstellar proton gas in heliosheath regions , adding to the confining pressure .",
    "an important response characteristic is that , for many clouds , the encounter will be ram - pressure dominated , where @xmath26 for interstellar cloud mass density @xmath27 and relative sun - cloud velocity @xmath17 , so that variations in the cloud velocity perturb the heliosphere even if the thermal pressures remain constant .",
    "the multifluid , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) , hydrodynamic and hybrid approaches used in the following chapters provide much more substantial models for the heliosphere , and include the coupling between neutrals and plasma , and field - particle interactions .",
    "these sophisticated models predict variations in the global heliosphere in the face of changing interstellar boundary conditions , and for a range of different cloud types .",
    "although impossible to model a solar encounter with every type of interstellar cloud , the following articles include discussions of many of the extremes of the interstellar parameter space , including low density gas with a range of velocities , very tenuous plasma , high velocity clouds , dense ism , and magnetized material for a range of field orientations and strengths .",
    "the discussions in these chapters extrapolate from our best theoretical understanding of the heliosphere boundary conditions today to values that differ , in some cases dramatically , from the boundary conditions that prevailed at the beginning of the third millennium in the gregorian calendar .",
    "the sun has been , and will be , subjected to many different physical environments over its lifetime .",
    "theoretical heliosphere models yield the properties of the solar wind - ism interaction for these different environments , which in turn determine the nature and properties of interstellar populations inside of the heliosphere for a range of galactic environments .",
    "these models form the foundation for understanding the significance of our galactic environment for the earth .",

    "the interstellar magnetic field introduces an asymmetric pressure on the heliosphere , affecting the heliosphere current sheet and cosmic ray modulation .",
    "pogorelov and zank ( chapter 3 ) use mhd models to probe the heliosphere response to the interstellar magnetic field , including charge exchange between the neutrals and solar wind .",
    "the resulting asymmetry provides a test of the magnetic field direction , and shows strong differences between cases where the interstellar flow is parallel , instead of perpendicular , to the interstellar magnetic field direction .",
    "since the random component of the interstellar magnetic field is stronger , on the average , than the ordered component , particularly in spiral arm regions where active star formation occurs , a range of interstellar magnetic field strengths and orientations are expected over the solar lifetime ( shaviv , chapter 5 , and frisch and slavin , chapter 6 ) .",
    "the earth s magnetosphere acts as a buffer between the solar wind and atmosphere , and as such is an ingredient in understanding the effect of our galactic environment on the earth .",
    "the decreasing solar wind density in the outer heliosphere results in an interplanetary medium around outer planets that is more sensitive to ism variations than for inner planets , with implications for the magnetospheres of jupiter , neptune , and uranus .",

    "there is every reason to expect that the galactic environment of the sun varies over geological timescales .",
    "the sun moves through space at a velocity of 1320 , and interstellar clouds have velocities ranging up to hundreds of .",
    "the arecibo millennium survey showed that @xmath025% of the mass contained in interstellar , including both warm and cold ism , is in clouds traveling with velocities @xmath3110  through the local standard of rest ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus sun - cloud encounters with relative velocities exceeding 25 are quite likely , and for a typical cloud length of @xmath01 pc the cloud transit time would be @xmath040,000 years .",

    "the sun entered a flow of tenuous , partly neutral ism , nick - named the `` local fluff '' , with density @xmath060 times higher ( chapter 6 ) .",
    "this transition was accompanied by the appearance of interstellar dust and neutrals in the heliosphere , along with the pickup ion and anomalous cosmic ray populations .",
    "galactic cosmic ray modulation was affected , providing a possible link between our galactic environment and climate .",
    "intriguingly , the averaged cosmic ray flux at earth , as traced by  records , was lower in the past @xmath0135 kyrs than for earlier times ( chapter 12 ) .",
    "was the decrease in the galactic cosmic ray flux @xmath0135 kyrs ago caused by an increase in modulation as the sun entered the local fluff ?",
    "the galactic environment of the sun also varies quite dramatically over long time scales , as discussed by shaviv ( chapter 5 ) . over its 4.5 billion year lifetime ,",
    "the sun traverses spiral arm and interarm regions , with atomic densities varying from less than @xmath34 g  to over @xmath35 g , and temperatures ranging over 7 orders of magnitude , 1010@xmath36 k. the sun is now in low density space between the perseus and sagittarius spiral arms , and on the inner edge of what is known as the orion spur on the local arm .",

    "paleoclimate archives include terrestrial records of cosmic ray spallation in the atmosphere , as traced by radioisotopes with short half - lives ( ) , e.  g.   ( = 5,730 yrs ) and  ( = 1.6 myrs ) .",
    "possible mechanisms linking the cosmic ray flux at 1 au and the climate include cloud nucleation by cosmic rays , and the global electrical circuit ( see chapter 12 and @xcite ) .",
    "the discussion in chapter 12 provides persuasive evidence linking the surface temperature to cosmic ray fluxes at earth .",
    "the anticorrelation between sunspot number and cosmic ray fluxes in figure [ fig:2 ] shows the heliosphere role in cosmic ray modulation ; this mechanism must have also been a prominent mechanism for relating the ism - modulated heliosphere with the climate .",
    "fortunately this hypothesis is also verifiable by comparing paleoclimate data with astronomical data on the timing of cloud transitions .",
    "the radioisotope records also indicate that cosmic ray fluctuations have occurred over longer timescales of many @xmath50 years .",
    "shaviv compares the  ( @xmath00.3 myrs ) and  ( @xmath01.3 gyr ) cosmic ray exposure records in iron meteorites ( chapter 5 ) , but in this case to obtain cosmic ray flux increases due to the sun s location in spiral arms where active star formation occurs .",
    "a number of studies , none convincing , have invoked the geological  record , as a proxy for cosmic ray fluxes at earth , to infer historical encounters with interstellar clouds . as a way of dating the loop i supernova remnant , it was suggested that the relative constancy of  in sea sediments precluded a strong nearby x - ray source within the past @xmath02 myrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "sonett ( 1992 ) suggested that peaks in  layers 35,000 and 65,000 years ago resulted from a compressed heliosphere caused by the passage of a high - velocity interstellar shock .",
    "this extreme heliosphere compression expected for a rapidly moving cloud is supported by heliosphere models ( chapter 2 ) .",
    "structure in the peaks has also been related to spatial structure in the local ism ( @xcite ) , and solar wind turbulence caused by mass - loading of interstellar neutrals may supply the required mechanism .",
    "global geomagnetic excursions such as the events @xmath032 kyr and @xmath040 kyr ago also affect the  record , and can not be ignored ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , figure [ fig:2 ] shows the sensitivity of galactic cosmic ray fluxes on earth to geomagnetic latitude .",
    "this brief summary of the scientific question motivating this book does not relay the full significance of the galactic environment of the sun to the heliosphere and earth ; the following chapters provide deeper insights into this question .",
    "historical and paleoclimate data show a correspondence between high cosmic ray flux levels and cool temperatures on earth ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disappearance of sunspots for extended periods of time , such as the maunder minimum in the years 1645 to 1715 , shows up in terrestrial radioisotope records such as  in ice cores ( chapter 12 ) .",
    "the solar magnetic activity cycle was present during this period , and cosmic ray modulation by the heliosphere was still evident ( @xcite ) .",
    "the  record now extends to @xmath010@xmath49 years before present , raising the hope that encounters between the sun and interstellar clouds can be separated from solar activity effects , and from the global signature of geomagnetic pole wandering .",
    "sunspots have long been controversial as an influence on the terrestrial climate .",
    "sir william herschel carefully observed them , and postulated that diminished solar radiation at earth during sunspot maximum affected the terrestrial climate ( 1801 ) .",
    "langley ( 1876 ) measured the radiative heat from sunspot umbral and penumbral regions , and concluded the @xmath320.1% solar radiation decrease associated with sunspots was inadequate to affect the climate .",
    "climate records show that the maunder minimum and other periods of low solar activity levels have been exceptionally cold , which implicates high cosmic ray fluxes with cold climate conditions .",
    "solar activity levels have returned to historic highs in the past few decades ( @xcite ) , and the historic correlations indicate these high levels also yield warm climate conditions .",
    "unfortunately , these scientific conclusions also impact the politically loaded issue of global warming .",
    "the possibility that the cosmos has affected the terrestrial climate is a longtime source of speculation , with many of the first discussions focused on explaining the  universal deluge `` . in 1694",
    "edmond halley presented his thoughts to the royal society as to whether the ' ' casual shock of a comet , or other transient body `` might instantly alter the axis orientation or diurnal rotation of the earth , thus disturbing sea levels , or whether the impact of a comet could explain the presence of ' ' vast quantities of earth and high cliffs upon beds of shells , which once were the bottom of the sea \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "halley s speculation has resurfaced in the hypothesis that the impact of a comet led to the extinction of dinosaurs 65 myrs ago at the cretaceous - tertiary boundary ( @xcite ) .",
    "the common sense disclaimer that accompanied halley s discussion is timeless : _",
    "`` ... the almighty generally making us of natural means to bring about his will , i thought it not amiss to give this honourable society an account of some thoughts that occurrd to me on this subject ; wherein , if i err , i shall find myself in very good company . '' _    the articles in this volume show firmly that the interaction between the heliosphere and ism depends on the detailed boundary conditions set for the heliosphere by each type of interstellar cloud encountered by the sun , and that the galactic environment of the sun changes over both geologically short time scales of @xmath51 years , and long time scales of @xmath52 years .",
    "this interaction , in turn , affects the flux of gas , dust , and energetic particles in the inner heliosphere .",
    "the discussions in this book also apply to the study of astrospheres around cool stars , which are expected to have similar properties as the heliosphere .",
    "is the historical astrosphere of a star a factor in climate stability for planetary systems ?",
    "i think so ( @xcite ) .",
    "if so , then the sample of @xmath0100 detected extrasolar planetary systems can be narrowed to those that are the most likely to harbor technological civilizations by evaluating the astrosphere characteristics suitable to the space trajectory of each star ( @xcite ) .",
    "astrospheres have now been detected towards @xmath060% of the observed cool stars within 10 pc ( @xcite ) , and extensive efforts to detect earth - sized exoplanets are underway . perhaps some day these questions will be answered .",
