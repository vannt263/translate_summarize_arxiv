    "<S> the giant @xmath0-core  maximal connected subgraph of a network where each node has at least @xmath0 neighbors  is important in the study of phase transitions and in applications of network theory . unlike erds - rnyi graphs and other random networks where @xmath0-cores emerge discontinuously for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we show that transitive linking ( or triadic closure ) leads to 3-cores emerging through single or double phase transitions of both discontinuous and continuous nature . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a @xmath0-core calculation that includes clustering and provides insights into how high - level connectivity emerges .    </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of high - level or large - scale connectivity patterns on a network influences its macroscopic behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> it is at times essential , as it is for traffic on transportation networks or communication on the internet , and at times detrimental , such as epidemics on social networks or cascades of failure on technological networks . </S>",

    "<S> when _ and _ how _ strong connectivity appears or disappears is critical . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the explosion of models to produce phase transitions of rich and diverse nature on networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here discuss how single or double phase transitions of both discontinuous and continuous nature can occur solely due to the structure of a network , without ad hoc rules or complicated models . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we focus on random networks with clustering and investigate the emergence of @xmath0-cores .    </S>",
    "<S> giant @xmath0-cores are the largest maximal connected sub - graphs of the network where each node has at least @xmath0 neighbors within the subgraph . </S>",
    "<S> we use the word ` giant ' when the largest @xmath0-core component scales linearly with the size of the network . </S>",
    "<S> network @xmath0-cores are important for network analysis @xcite , diffusion of information @xcite , and the spread of diseases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a well - known result is that the giant @xmath0-core of the erds - rnyi graphs @xcite emerges discontinuously @xcite if @xmath2 , whereas giant @xmath3-core ( the largest connected component ) and @xmath4-core emerge continuously .    </S>",
    "<S> however , many empirical studies @xcite have shown that most real - world networks are highly clustered , i.e. they have a large number of triangles and higher order motifs , which can not be accounted for by simple random network models like erds - rnyi ( er ) networks @xcite , block models @xcite , or the configuration model @xcite.we here consider the simplest way in which we can extend the er random network model to incorporate clustering by using transitive linking or triadic closure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that despite its simplicity , this ensemble of networks shows remarkably rich features in its @xmath0-core structure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on the emergence of giant 3-cores ( henceforth we omit the word ` giant ' )  and calculate their sizes in more realistic networks with clustering .    considering that real - world networks are often highly clustered @xcite , our results challenge the typical assumption of simple and discontinuous emergence of @xmath0-core structure . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions therefore have important implications on resilience @xcite , outbreaks of diseases @xcite or social contagions @xcite , jamming @xcite and failures of multiple dependent networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these processes can be interpreted as generalizations to higher order constraints of classic bond percolation . </S>",
    "<S> they thus all depend , either directly or indirectly , on the @xmath0-core structure and clustering of connections in a network .    </S>",
    "<S> our model , which we call the @xmath5-process , is a one - step extension to the classic er random network . </S>",
    "<S> it has two parameters , @xmath6 , the average degree of the er substrate , and @xmath7 the probability of transitive links . </S>",
    "<S> we generate an ensemble of random networks with the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , draw an er random network with average degree @xmath6 . on this network , identify all pairs of nodes joined by a mutual neighbor ( equivalently all motifs with three nodes and two links ) . </S>",
    "<S> connect each of these pairs independently with probability @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath7 controls the level of clustering in the network . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth we call links from the er substrate as ` er - links ' and links from the transitive linking process as ` clustering ' links </S>",
    "<S> .    a node with er degree @xmath0 , has @xmath8 pairs of neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> each pair is linked with probability @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the total number of clustering links is given by @xmath9 yielding a total average degree of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> a more careful , but similar calculation gives us the full degree - distribution . </S>",
    "<S> each node with er degree @xmath11 , has second - neighbors distributed as the sum of @xmath11 poisson random variables with average excess degree @xmath6 ( average number of links from a node reached by a random link , not counting the link you came from ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of @xmath11 poisson random variables with average @xmath6 is again a poisson random variable with average @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> each of these second - neighbors is linked to the node with probability @xmath7 , yielding a poisson distributed number of clustering links with average @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total degree distribution is given by , @xmath14 where the individual terms within the summation are the joint probability distribution of a node having @xmath11 er links and @xmath15 clustering links .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we are only interested in the @xmath0-core structure of this model . </S>",
    "<S> note that the transitive linking process does not change the size of the 1-core as it only links nodes that are already in the same component . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath5-process can upgrade nodes in the 1-core component to a 2-core nodes by connecting the nodes of degree-1 to nodes of higher degree , but since in the er substrate both the giant 1-core and 2-core emerge at exactly @xmath16 , we expect no difference after the transitive linking process . the emergence of the 3-core as a function of @xmath6 exhibits four distinct regimes depending on @xmath7 ,    1 .   a regime of sudden discontinuous appearance of a 3-core when @xmath7 is lesser than some bound @xmath17 ( we notate @xmath18 ) , 2 .   a double phase transition regime consisting of a continuous appearance of a 3-core followed by a discontinuous jump in size when @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> another double phase transition regime consisting of two continuous transitions when @xmath20 , 4 .   a single sudden but continuous appearance of a 3-core for @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the effect of @xmath7 on the size of the 3-core , we develop the following analytical approximations : we calculate the 3-core sizes in random networks with the same degree distribution as our @xmath5-process and in random networks with the same joint degree - triangle distribution as our @xmath5-process . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations lead us to conclude that the degree - distribution and clustering by themselves are not a sufficient to explain the regimes of double transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also highlight the role of higher order motifs in the @xmath5-process . +    [ [ configuration - model . ] ] * configuration model . * + </S>",

    "<S> the probability @xmath22 , that a randomly chosen link does _ not _ lead to the 3-core is given by , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the generating function for the degree distribution @xcite and @xmath25 is its @xmath26-th derivative . from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we then calculate the fraction @xmath28 of nodes in the 3-core by summing the probability that a randomly chosen node has at least three links leading to the @xmath29-core ( or one minus the probability of having less than three ) : @xmath30    this approach always leads to discontinuous transitions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ clustered - and - config - model ] ) , which shows that the degree distribution alone is not sufficient to explain the existence of the three other regimes . </S>",

    "<S> we wish to calculate the size of the @xmath29-core given this probability @xmath31 of a randomly chosen node having @xmath0 links and @xmath32 triangles . </S>",
    "<S> this ensemble of networks was introduced to study the impact of clustering on bond percolation @xcite . in networks without clustering , all links were considered independent ( as they are indeed independent in a fully random network ) . however , this assumption fails when a network contains triangles and we must therefore explicitly account for triangles through additional self - consistent equations .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be the excess degree - triangle distribution when following a link or a triangle , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can write self - consistent equations for the probability @xmath22 of following a link to a node _ not _ in the 3-core , the probability @xmath35 that following a triangle does _ not _ lead to two nodes in the 3-core and the probability @xmath36 that following a triangle leads to exactly _ zero _ node in the 3-core . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ cartoon - kore ] gives a visual representation of these probabilities and motifs . </S>",

    "<S> equation ( [ eqn : u ] ) is equivalent to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ uconfig ] ) , a regular link will not lead to the 3-core if the node it reaches has at _ most _ one link leading to the 3-core . </S>",
    "<S> this potential link can either be a regular link ( subscript @xmath41 for the binomial term @xmath42 ) or be one link of a triangle ( subscript @xmath6 for the binomial term @xmath43 ) , but no triangles can contribute more than a single link ( the term @xmath44 ) . equation ( [ eqn : v ] ) corresponds to following a triangle from one node and finding that both links lead to the 3-core , hence both nodes reached must have at _ least _ one other link leading to the 3-core . </S>",
    "<S> we thus write @xmath45 has the square of one minus the probability of having zero link leading to the 3-core , since the other links of these two nodes are independent . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eqn : w ] ) is more involved but similar . </S>",
    "<S> when following a triangle , if neither of the two links lead to the 3-core , both nodes must have at _ most _ one link leading to the 3-core , but they can not both have one as there is also a link between the two .    </S>",
    "<S> the size of the 3-core , @xmath28 , is then given by , @xmath46    we evaluate this formula on our @xmath5-process as follows . </S>",
    "<S> as we can not calculate the @xmath31 matrix analytically , we empirically obtain @xmath31 from generated networks and use this in eq .     to obtain fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> [ clustered - and - config - model ] . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this to the 3-core sizes obtained from rewired networks preserving @xmath31 and from our @xmath5-process simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we see that there is remarkable agreement except at the onset of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the rewired networks show a systematic quantitative difference as compared to our model . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the high density of adjacent triangles that share a link . under a configuration model </S>",
    "<S> rewiring , these adjacent triangles are very unlikely , which means that the rewired networks have a higher average degree from the same @xmath31 joint distribution . </S>",
    "<S> every triangle contributes two links in the clustered configuration model whereas , in the @xmath5-process , we see many pairs of adjacent triangles that account for only three links as they overlap .    </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the clustered configuration model captures how high clustering drastically diminishes the size of the discontinuous jump . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transition is still discontinuous and we do not see regimes of double phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus conclude that regimes ii through iv are caused the high number of adjacent triangles in the @xmath5-process and correlations between neighboring nodes .    </S>",

    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our model is a simple extension of the classic er network to include clustering through triadic closure . </S>",
    "<S> the degree distribution still has a gaussian tail , but remarkably we find four distinct regimes shaping how 3-cores can emerge : through a single discontinuous phase transition ( @xmath18 ) , through a double transition of hybrid nature ( @xmath19 ) , through two consecutive continuous transitions ( @xmath20 ) , or through a single continuous phase transition ( @xmath21 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the first and last regime were previously obtained in heterogeneous @xmath0-core percolation where different nodes have different thresholds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the regime of hybrid phase transitions ( @xmath19 ) was observed in the completely different context of percolation on interdependent networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these analogies might hold the key to understanding the mechanisms at play behind these different regimes : they all use a mixture of nodes with different sensitivity to `` criticality '' . </S>",
    "<S> criticality here means whether a given node is in the giant component or not ( either a giant percolating component , or a giant @xmath0-core ) . </S>",
    "<S> interdependent networks use a mixture of nodes that are either independent or dependent on a given node in a different networks . </S>",
    "<S> heterogeneous @xmath0-core percolation uses a mixture of nodes with different thresholds ; such that the giant component is a mixture of , for example , the 2-core and the 3-core . </S>",
    "<S> however we show that realistic networks can have very similar properties even using the simplest definition of @xmath0-cores where all nodes obey the same rules . in this context , these different sensitivities are structural ( e.g. is a node part of an important motif ) rather than _ ad hoc _ conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we showed a simple way to extend the configuration model to incorporate clustering in calculations for the size of the 3-core . </S>",
    "<S> this way of evaluating motifs can be extended straightforwardly to higher @xmath0-cores , and even to higher order motifs by introducing more self - consistent equations . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this new analytical @xmath0-core calculation will provide useful estimates for the aforementioned applications as well as for the emergence and growth of @xmath0-core structure in real - world networks . </S>"
