    "thermodynamic bethe ansatz is know to be one of the most impressive achievements of two dimensional physics relating ( in the high temperature limit ) the data of a perturbed conformal field theory ( cft ) and an exact factorizable s - matrix for relativistic integrable model with its spectrum and analytical structure .",
    "unfortunately not only s - matrix often has a conjectural status , but also the tba system corresponding to the s - matrix ( e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) . the main obstacle in exact derivation of tba system from s - matrix",
    "is usually related to the problem of diagonalization of transfer matrix ( tm ) , which is especially a non trivial issue , when s - matrix has internal degrees of freedom , i.e. is non diagonal . in this paper",
    "we show how one can solve this technical problem for relativistic integrable models using some facts , established in investigation of trigonometric tms of lattice models with lie algebraic symmetries .",
    "these results were obtained in the framework of algebraic bethe ansats @xcite@xcite , tm functional relations and analytical bethe ansatz @xcite .    the method to incorporate lattice model as",
    "a  carrier  of magnonic degrees of freedom responsible for entire symmetries of a relativistic integrable model , is an alternative to another method of explicit lattice light cone regularization of whole relativistic model ( see , e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "as far as we know , the first time this program was successfully brought about by hollowood in @xcite , where he derived tba system in the @xmath6 case .",
    "another successfull implementation of this procedure was done in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use this method applying it to the integrable models with other lie algebraic symmetries .",
    "it is known for a long time @xcite that integrable quantum field theories arising as perturbations of the coset cft @xmath7 by the operator @xmath1 for different lie algebras @xmath8 is a wide class of models , with with @xmath9 symmetric trigonometric s - matrices , @xmath10 a root of unity .",
    "more precisely , it was conjectured in @xcite that the massive s - matrix has the symmetry @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dual coxeter number of @xmath14 . in other words ,",
    "the s - matrix is , up to a scalar factor , a tensor product of two trigonometric @xmath15 invariant integrable models at @xmath10 a root of unity , i.e. rsos models .",
    "this class of s - matrices contains some other integrable quantum field theories ( iqft ) with yangian symmetry ( rational s - matrices ) , as a subclasses with specific choice of parameters @xmath16 : principal chiral models ( pcm ) : @xmath17 , gross - neveu models ( gn ) group . ] and current - current perturbations of wzw models : @xmath18 .",
    "there is a lot of literature devoted to investigation of these models and we wo nt cite it here . in the context of the general @xmath19 symmetry these limits for",
    "@xmath20 mean some essential simplification in the s - matrix structure , related to peculiarity of rsos models and some identities existing between them for low level of restriction , which we discuss in the last section .",
    "as we said , the main goal of this work is direct derivation of  tba equations from the full s - matrix and their high temperature analysis . in principle , such derivation is impossible , in @xmath21 and @xmath22 cases , since the spectral decomposition of the s - matrices is unknown for arbitrary two fundamental highest weights of the algebras because of multiplicities appearing in irreducible representations decomposition .",
    "but as we will see below , even in these cases some information about the full s - matrix can be extracted from requirement of consistency of derived tba equations . more precisely , the requirement that the obtained tba system will correspond to the proper @xmath5-system , fixes the crossing - unitarising prefactor of corresponding s - matrices .",
    "in contrast , in the cases @xmath6 and @xmath23 the irrep .",
    "decomposition of tensor product of any two fundamental representations is known , and full s - matrix may be written explicitly .",
    "derivation of tba @xmath5-system is exact in the sense the assumption about this prefactor can be checked exactly . in all the cases of the considered lie algebras @xmath14",
    "we show that the derived tba equations lead to the correct ground state free energy reproducing in the uv limit the central charge of the coset .    in the second section",
    "we show how results about transfer matrix diagonalization may be used in the derivation of tba equations in the framework of bethe ansatz ( ba ) string hypothesis .",
    "we show the role of magnonic degrees of freedom and their relation to the main massive particles . in the third section",
    "we show that in the thermodynamic limit one of the possible magnonic degrees of freedom is always  frozen   it always has zero density of holes , and we perform the reduction of this degree of freedom in the equations .",
    "the main fourth part is devoted to the transformation of obtained system of equations to the form of @xmath5-system .",
    "as we show , this transformation is possible and requires a natural assumption about the form of the full s - matrix . using results of @xcite",
    ", we show that the obtained @xmath5systems has correct high temperature behavior , reproducing central charges of the coset for any @xmath24 . in the fifth section",
    "we show that the assumption made about the form of the crossing unitarising scalar prefactor of the s - matrix , is really correct in the @xmath25 cases .",
    "we also discuss particular cases of the general s - matrix for some specific models with yangian symmetry .",
    "we conclude the paper by brief discussion . in appendix",
    "we collect kernels and technical details of the tba derivation .",
    "in contrast to the case of relativistic two dimensional integrable quantum field theories ( iqft ) with elastic ( diagonal ) s - matrices , such as , e.g. s - matrices of affine toda field theories ( see , e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite ) , the transfer matrix diagonalization for the iqft with internal lie algebraic symmetry , is hard , and , in general , non solvable problem .",
    "more progress was achieved in solution of this problem in lattice models , such as spin chains or rsos models invariant under some lie algebraic symmetry , rather in relativistic iqft . here",
    "we recall one simple method to attach the lattice results , derived in rsos like traditional bethe ansatz methods , to explicit derivation of tba equations for s - matrices describing integrable perturbations of @xmath26 coset cfts ( @xmath2 ) relevantly perturbed by operator @xmath1 .",
    "the s - matrix for this iqft was conjectured a long time ago @xcite and it has the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is unitary , crossing symmetric  minimal  ( without poles in the physical strip @xmath29 ) rsos - like s - matrix for scattering of two particles from two multiplets corresponding to fundamental weights @xmath30 and @xmath31 of algebra @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath32 is the restriction level of rsos model .",
    "@xmath33 is a cdd factor which generates poles for the s - matrix corresponding to each fundamental weight of @xmath14 , and guarantee the bootstrap closure .",
    "recall that from the point of view of quantum groups , @xmath34 rsos s - matrix has the @xmath35 symmetry with @xmath10 a root of unity @xmath36 .",
    "the procedure of tba derivation is standard : we pull one particle @xmath37 from the fundamental multiplet @xmath38 with rapidity @xmath39 , through a gas of other particles living on a circle of length @xmath40 . on the way it scatters on each other particle @xmath41 with rapidity @xmath42 with the s - matrix @xmath43 ,",
    "giving rise to the transfer matrix @xmath44 the requirement of the wave function periodicity looks like @xmath45 non diagonality of the scattering leads to the change of states of the particle inside its multiplet . in terms of bethe ansatz",
    ", this change is taken into account by means of magnonic excitations described by bethe ansatz equation ( bae ) .",
    "they are responsible for the non diagonal part of the s - matrix , defined by spectral decomposition , whereas the diagonal part is defined by the prefactors before this spectral decomposition ",
    "@xmath33 , and crossing - unitarising prefactors @xmath46 of the minimal s - matrices @xmath47 .",
    "explicit and full form of the non diagonal part of the transfer matrix in terms of magnonic degrees of freedom is complicated .",
    "but it was proven by kirillov and reshetikhin for simply laced algebras @xcite , and conjectured , and partly proved , for non simply laced algebras @xcite , that in the thermodynamic limit , when the number of particles @xmath48 together with the length @xmath40 are going to infinity , there is dominating ",

    "leaving only this top term , we have for the transfer matrix the following expression @xmath49 @xmath50 here the last line describes the  top  term contribution , according to @xcite , @xmath13 is a dual coxeter number of algebra @xmath14 , @xmath51 - integer number related to the node @xmath30 of dynkin diagram of @xmath14 . for algebras @xmath2",

    "it is worth to notice here that rapidities of the physical particles @xmath60 appear as inhomogeneities in the l.h.s . of the bae ( [ bae ] ) for magnonic degrees of freedom",
    "this procedure differes from light cone lattice regularization scheme for relativistic iqft , when one considers bae like ( [ bae ] ) with light cone inhomogeneities @xmath61 in the l.h.s . , and mass scale is introduced in a special scaling limit : @xmath62 , lattice step @xmath63 .",
    "it is important that according to the general conjecture @xcite@xcite about the top term ( [ tm1 ] ) , this transfer matrix eigenvalue is associated to a representation of @xmath64 with highest weight @xmath65 and the rsos restrictions @xmath66 impose important restrictions on the possible values of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the highest root of @xmath14 .",
