    "searching for the phase boundary in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram is one of the main motivations of the beam energy scan ( bes ) program at rhic .",
    "the elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) could be used as a powerful tool  @xcite , because of the sensitivity of underlying dynamics in the early stage of the collisions .",
    "the number of constituent quark ( ncq ) scaling in the top energy collisions at rhic ( = 200 gev ) indicates the collectivity has been built up in the partonic level  @xcite .",
    "recently , the similar ncq scaling of multi - strange hadrons , @xmath7 and @xmath19 , which are less sensitive to the late hadronic interactions provides the clear evidence of partonic collectivity  @xcite .",
    "an energy dependence study based on a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model indicates the ncq scaling is related to the degrees of freedom in the system  @xcite .",
    "if the partonic degree of freedom is included in the ampt model , the ncq scaling ( including multi - strange hadrons ) could be observed ; whereas the ncq scaling is broken in the case of including only hadronic degree of freedom .",
    "the bes data offer us the opportunity to investigate the qcd phase boundary with @xmath0 measurements . in this paper",
    ", we present the @xmath16 results from the star experiment in au+au collisions at = 7.7 - 62.4 gev .",

    "the observed difference in @xmath0 reflects that the particles vs. anti - particles could not fit into the ncq scaling .",
