    "in recent years , stoichiometric yb - based heavy fermion compounds have raised a lot of interest , particularly due to the limited number of such systems known to date .",
    "ybptin is one of the few examples of such heavy fermion systems@xcite , as indicated by measurements performed on single crystal samples extracted from on - line melts of the polycrystalline material .",
    "based on the existing data@xcite , ybptin has a relatively low magnetic ordering temperature ( t@xmath8 k ) and an enhanced electronic specific heat coefficient ( @xmath9 mj@xmath10mol k@xmath11 ) , whereas the magnetic entropy at t@xmath12 amounts to only about 60@xmath13 of the @xmath14 value expected for a doublet ground state . in light of these observations , this system appears to be qualitatively similar to the other recently studied yb - based heavy fermion antiferromagnets , ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite , and ybagge@xcite , the latter compound being isostructural to ybptin . in ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15",
    ", magnetic order occurring at very low temperature ( below 70 mk)@xcite was associated with a low entropy release ( around 0.01 @xmath16)@xcite . for the ybagge@xcite compound , the temperature associated with the magnetically ordered state , whereas still fairly low ( @xmath17 k ) , is enhanced compared to that of ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15 ; also , the magnetic entropy at the ordering temperature is larger than in ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15 , but still less than 10@xmath13 of @xmath14 . thus these two compounds can be regarded as systems with small moment ordering . having an even higher ordering temperature and magnetic entropy at t@xmath12 , ybptin seemed a good candidate to further study a progression from small moment to reduced moment ordering , in stoichiometric yb - based heavy fermion compounds , with field - induced quantum critical point .",
    "in contrast to a classical phase transition at finite temperatures , driven by temperature as a control parameter with thermal fluctuations , a quantum phase transition is driven by a control parameter c other than temperature ( _ e.g. _ , c = pressure , doping or magnetic field ) at t = 0 , with quantum mechanical fluctuations .",
    "such a control parameter tunes the system from a magnetically ordered state towards a state without magnetic order , at zero temperature , crossing a quantum critical point . due to the hybridization of the 4f electrons and the conduction electrons in heavy fermion ( hf ) systems , which can be modified by any one of the aforementioned c control parameters , the ( hf ) compounds are very suitable to study quantum critical behavior .",
    "moreover , close to the critical value c@xmath18 which drives the ordering temperature close to zero , pronounced deviations from the fermi liquid - like fl behavior can occur .",
    "this has been observed in a large number of hf systems where c = doping or pressure , and only a few doped systems have been field - tuned through a qcp@xcite . to date , ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite are the only stoichiometric yb - based hf compounds in which a field - induced quantum critical point qcp has been observed . the heavy fermion character of the ybptin system has already been reported@xcite ; in this paper we will discuss the existence of a field - induced qcp in ybptin which renders it very similar to the other two stoichiometric , yb - based heavy fermions .",
    "recently we presented anisotropic low - field susceptibility measurements , as well as specific heat data in zero applied field , on solution - grown single crystals of the rptin series , including ybptin@xcite .",
    "no features indicative of magnetic order could be identified in our magnetization measurements on single crystals of the r = yb compound , down to t @xmath19 2 k. however , a well - defined peak at @xmath20 k in the zero - field specific heat data suggests that this compound orders magnetically below 2.1 k , just above the low temperature limit of our magnetization measurements . as we will present in this paper , detailed transport and thermodynamic measurements down to 0.4 k not only confirm the magnetic ordering in this compound below 2.1 k , but also suggest that another phase transition might exist in this system around 1 k.    however , our measurements were in part inconsistent with previous reports on ybptin single crystals : whereas kaczorowski _ _ et al.__@xcite have also presented magnetization data showing no features associated with magnetic ordering above 1.7 k , in their specific heat measurements three anomalies can be observed ( at 3.1 , 2.3 , and 1.2 k ) , all at slightly different temperatures than in our data .",
    "furthermore , the low - field susceptibility data presented by trovarelli _ _ et al.__@xcite are consistent with an ordering temperature around 3.4 k , also confirmed by their resistivity and specific heat measurements .    in order to address these apparent discrepancies between our data on solution",
    "grown single crystals and the two previous reports on on - line grown single crystals@xcite , we reproduced the growth as described by trovarelli _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the anisotropic specific heat and transport measurements on our single crystals extracted from the melt confirmed the existence of magnetic phase transitions at 3.4 k and 1.4 k , as observed previously .",
    "in this paper we will try to examine the differences between solution and on - line grown single crystals , given that a small pt - deficiency occurred in the former types of crystals , leading to a stoichiometry closest to ybpt@xmath1 in , and no disorder could be detected in the on - line grown crystals .",
    "also , given that heavy fermion compounds with small moment ordering are likely to be driven to a quantum critical point qcp by disorder or applied field , we will study the evolution of both ybpt@xmath1 in and ybptin towards a field - induced qcp .",
    "detailed anisotropic measurements of specific heat and resistivity on the two types of crystals , for fields up to 140 kg and temperatures down to 0.4 k , will be used for the comparison between the two types of crystals .",
    "additional hall effect measurements were performed on the solution grown single crystals for the same temperature and field ranges , allowing us to further explore the effects of the qcp in this compound .",
    "after briefly describing the methods used for synthesizing the two types of ybptin single crystals , and the measurement techniques used for the sample characterization , we will present the results of single crystal x - ray diffraction .",
    "next we will compare the low field data for the two types of compounds , pointing out the similarities , as well as the significant differences in their physical properties .",
    "next we will present the higher field data for both types of crystals , for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this will allow us to follow , in both systems , the progression from reduced magnetic moment order to the quantum critical point qcp , as driven by the application of increasing magnetic field .",
    "also , we will extend the zero - field comparison between the two ybptin systems to their field- dependent properties , and will try to identify common features as well as possible effects of the site deficiency .",
    "ybptin is one of the rptin compounds , reported to crystallize in zrnial hexagonal structure@xcite , space group p@xmath23 .",
    "single crystals of this compound were obtained by two methods : from high - temperature ternary solution , as described in ref . [ 15 ] , and from stoichiometric on - line melt@xcite .",
    "the initial concentration used for the solution growth was yb@xmath24pt@xmath25in@xmath26 , and the ternary solution , sealed in a 3-cap ta crucible@xcite under partial argon pressure , was slow - cooled from 1200@xmath27 c to 1000@xmath27 c over approximately 100 hours .",
    "subsequently , the excess liquid solution was decanted , and the resulting hexagonal rods were briefly etched in hcl to remove residual flux from the surface .",
    "for the on - line melt , 1:1:1 atomic ratios of yb , pt and in were sealed in a ta crucible under partial argon atmosphere .",
    "after briefly heating the sealed crucible up to approximately 1650@xmath27 c in an induction furnace , the crucible was sealed in a quartz ampoulle and annealed at 700@xmath27 c for 120 hours .",
    "small rods were subsequently extracted from the resulting crystalline conglomerate .",
    "anisotropic magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and applied field m(h , t ) were performed in a quantum design mpms squid magnetometer ( t @xmath28 k , h@xmath29 kg ) .",
    "temperature- and field - dependent specific heat c@xmath30(h , t ) , resistivity @xmath31(h , t ) and hall resistivity @xmath32(h , t ) measurements were taken in a quantum design ppms-14 instrument with he-3 option , for temperatures down to 0.4 k , and applied magnetic fields between 0 and 140 kg .",
    "for the anisotropic ( _ i.e. , _ @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) specific heat measurements a relaxation technique with fitting of the whole calorimeter ( sample with sample platform and puck ) was used .",
    "the sample platform and grease background , measured separately for all necessary ( h , t ) values , was subtracted from the sample response . also , the non - magnetic contribution to the total specific heat was estimated based on measurements on flux - grown luptin , used as the non - magnetic analogue of ybptin .",
    "the single crystals of luptin were grown using similar initial composition ( r@xmath35pt@xmath35in@xmath36 ) and temperature profile ( slow cooling from 1190@xmath27c to 800@xmath27c over @xmath19100 hours ) that yielded fully - occupied rptin single crystals for the lighter members of the series@xcite .",
    "we therefore anticipate that the luptin crystals are also fully - occupied , and we used this system as the non - magnetic analogue for our both yb compounds .",
    "it should be noted that we made the assumption that the non - magnetic background is insensitive to the 2@xmath13 pt - deficiency in the solution - grown compound .",
    "the specific heat for luptin was measured in the same temperature range as for ybptin and ybpt@xmath1 in , for 0 and 140 kg applied field , and was found to be virtually field - independent over the measured temperature range .    a standard ac four - probe resistance technique ( @xmath37 hz , @xmath38 ma ) was used for the field- and temperature - dependent resistivity measurements . given the rod - like geometry of the samples , the current was always flowing along the crystallographic c - axis , whereas the field was either parallel ( for longitudinal magnetoresistance ) , or perpendicular ( for transverse magnetoresistance ) to the direction of current flow .",
    "the hall resistivity measurements were performed on a sample that was polished down to a plate - like shape .",
    "this sample geometry restricted the hall resistivity measurements to the field applied within the hexagonal crystallographic plane ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the hall resistivity @xmath32(h , t ) was measured for field perpendicular to both the current and the hall voltage directions . in order to minimize the inherent ( small ) misalignment of the voltage contacts ,",
    "these measurements were taken for two opposite directions of the applied field , h and -h , and the odd component , ( @xmath32(h ) - @xmath32(-h))@xmath40 was taken as the hall resistivity .    for each of the two systems ( ybptin and ybpt@xmath1 in ) , we will compare the similar data for the the two orientations of the applied field ( _ i.e. _ , for @xmath39 and @xmath41 ) , as well as the resulting t - h phase diagrams .",
    "the criteria used for determining the points on all presented phase diagrams will be discussed in more detail in the appropriate sections , but in general they were maxima in the c@xmath30(h , t ) data , and derivative maxima or onset values for the transport data . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the maximum temperature for which the @xmath42 could be fit to a straight line was the criterium used in determining the upper limit of this fermi liquid - like region .",
    "additional hall resistivity measurements were performed for the field applied within the basal plane , for the ybpt@xmath1 in ( flux - grown ) compound .",
    "various criteria were used for determining critical points similar to the hall line for the ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite systems .",
    "for both solution and on - line grown crystals , the crystal structure was confirmed by powder x - ray diffraction , with no detectable impurity peaks .",
    "however , additional single crystal x - ray measurements were performed on the two types of ybptin compounds .",
    "crystals with dimensions @xmath43 and @xmath44 were extracted from the flux and on - line grown samples respectively .",
    "room - temperature x - ray diffraction data were collected on a stoe ipdsii image plate diffractometer with mo k@xmath45 radiation , and were recorded by taking @xmath46 scans in @xmath47 in the full reciprocal sphere .",
    "the range of 2 @xmath47 extended from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "numerical absorption corrections for both crystals were based on crystal face indexing , followed by a crystal shape optimization .",
    "structure solution and refinement were done using the shelxtl program .",
    "the crystallographic and structural data are summarized in tables [ t1 ] - [ t2 ] .",
    ".atomic coordinates and equivalent isotropic displacement parameters ( @xmath50 ) for the flux - grown ybptin system .",

    ", a @xmath53 , c @xmath54 , r = 0.0273 , r@xmath55 = 0.0598 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a high temperature factor was inferred for pt(1 ) of the flux - grown crystal during final stages of the refinement , which is usually indicative of possible atomic deficiencies , symmetry reduction or superstructure formation .",
    "no superstructure reflections were observed , and symmetry reduction did not resolve the issue .",
    "however , relaxing pt(1 ) site occupancy resulted in a statistically significant deficiency ( 0.06(1 ) , table [ t1 ] ) , and led to improvements in the pt(1 ) temperature factor and overall residual r value .",
    "we also tested for possible deficiencies on the other atomic sites in this crystal , but refined occupancies for yb ( 1.00(6 ) ) , pt(2 ) ( 1.00(6 ) ) and in ( 1.02(2 ) ) did not suggest presence of atomic deficiencies .",
    "thus the composition of the flux - grown crystal can be written as ybpt@xmath1 in , noting that the pt@xmath1 value reflects the pt stoichiometry of the whole unit cell , not just of the pt(1 ) site .",
    "in contrast to the flux - grown sample , the pt(1 ) temperature factor of the on - line grown crystal had a reasonable value . relaxing the pt(1 ) occupancy yielded only a slight and statistically insignificant deficiency of 0.014(9 ) ( table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "occupancy refinement for other atomic sites showed no deviations from unity .",
    "although small deficiencies on the pt(1 ) site could not be excluded , the ybptin formula is a good presentation of the composition of the on - line crystal in terms of sensitivity of our x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "this difference in the stoichiometry of the solution and on - line grown samples is consistent with ybptin having a small width of formation extending towards the pt - deficient side ; given that the initial melt composition is very pt - poor ( _ i.e. _ , yb@xmath24pt@xmath25in@xmath26 ) , it is expected to be sensitive to such a small width of formation",
    ".    a closer look at the atoms positions given in tables [ t1]-[t2 ] suggests that two compounds might be mirror images of each other ; whereas racemic twinning could not be excluded for either the solution or the on - line grown compounds , no evidence of the existence of both `` left '' and `` right '' structures in each system could be found .",
    "the lattice parameters and unit cell volume for the solution - grown , ybpt@xmath1 in crystals were @xmath56  , @xmath57 @xmath58and @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the analogous unit cell dimensions on the on - line grown crystals were slightly smaller : @xmath61  , @xmath62 @xmath58and @xmath63 @xmath60 .",
    "anisotropic magnetization measurements are presented in fig.[f01 ] for both the ybpt@xmath1 in ( full symbols ) and the ybptin ( open symbols ) compounds .",
    "as can be observed in fig.[f01]a , the paramagnetic susceptibility indicates moderate anisotropy for both systems ( with @xmath64 at the lowest temperature ) , and no clear sign of magnetic ordering down to @xmath65 k. the anisotropic m(h ) isotherms show a continuous increase of the magnetization , with a trend towards saturation above 40 kg ( fig.[f01]b ) for h applied within the ab - plane ; the axial magnetization remains linear and significantly smaller than m@xmath66 up to our maximum field available for these measurements ( 55 kg ) . whereas qualitatively there is an overall similarity between the corresponding data of the two compounds , the absolute values of both susceptibility and field - dependent magnetization",
    "are slightly larger for ybpt@xmath1 in than for ybptin .",
    "we believe the @xmath19 10 to 20@xmath13 difference to be too large to have been caused by weighing errors alone , and thus we conclude that it may reflect the different kondo temperatures and exchange coupling due to the change of stoichiometry in the two compounds .",
    "the zero - field specific heat and resistivity data shown in fig.[f02 ] are consistent with magnetic ordering in both compounds , however at different temperatures : two well defined peaks at t@xmath67 k and 1.4 k are visible in the ybptin c@xmath30(t ) data ( open symbols , fig.[f02]a ) , whereas only one peak can be distinguished , around 2 k , in the ybpt@xmath1 in data ( full symbols ) .",
    "these transition temperatures are marked by the vertical dotted lines for the former compound , and by one dashed line for the latter .",
    "it can be seen that the corresponding resistivity measurements ( fig.[f02]b ) show changes in slope around the respective transition temperatures .",
    "another noticeable difference between ybptin and ybpt@xmath1 in manifests in the resistivity values ( fig.[f02]b and [ frt300 ] ) with the ones for the former compound being approximately three times smaller in the latter one .",
    "the error bars shown for the lowest temperature @xmath31 values give a caliper of the uncertainty in estimating the resistivity values for the two compounds , further confirming the aforementioned difference .",
    "the larger residual resistivity in ybpt@xmath1 in is consistent with the additional disorder ( _ i.e. _ , site disorder ) or presence of additional vacancies in this type of crystals .",
    "thus the zero - field measurements indicate a dramatic effect of the small pt - deficiency on the ordered state in ybptin : the upper transition is shifted down in temperature in the pt - deficient compound , whereas a second one is clearly identifiable only in ybptin . in order to explore the differences between these two samples more thoroughly , a systematic study of the field - dependence of @xmath68 and c@xmath69",
    "was undertaken .      * @xmath39 * + the low - temperature specific heat data for the on - line grown compound ybptin is shown in fig.[f11]a , for various values of the applied field . as already seen , two sharp peaks present in the h = 0 data can be associated with magnetic phase transitions at t @xmath70 k and 1.4 k. as the applied field is increased , these transitions ( indicated by small arrows in fig.[f11]a ) move to lower temperatures , and eventually drop below 0.4 k around 20 kg , and 60 kg respectively .",
    "trovarelli _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have reported similar measurements up to 80 kg , which are consistent with our data ; however , their study did not include a systematic analysis of the h - t phase diagram or the potential quantum critical behavior in this compound . from the linear extrapolation of the zero - field c@xmath71",
    "_ vs. _ t@xmath11 data from t @xmath19 5 k down to t = 0 ( dotted line in the inset , fig.[f11]a ) , the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath72 can be roughly estimated as @xmath73 mj / mol k@xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic component of the specific heat is defined as @xmath74(ybptin)@xmath75(luptin ) , and is shown in fig.[f11]b as @xmath76 _ vs. _ t@xmath11 , for the same field values as before .    when the magnetic specific heat is plotted in c@xmath77 vs. @xmath78 t",
    "coordinates ( fig.[f11a ] ) , a reduced region of logarithmic divergency ( non - fermi liquid nfl behavior ) is apparent ; however this linear region in c@xmath79 is more ambiguous than in other heavy fermion compounds displaying nfl behavior ( _ e.g. _ , ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite ) . because of a downturn in the high field data ( h @xmath80 50 kg [ fig.[f11a]b ] ) around 5 k for h = 50 kg , the largest logarithmic divergency which occurs for h @xmath19 60 kg , is limited to only a fraction of a decade in temperature ( 1.5 k @xmath81 t @xmath81 6.5 k ) .",
    "the above observations suggests that a qcp may exist around a critical field value h@xmath4 just above 60 kg , but the presence of a nfl region at intermediate field values is less clearly defined than in the previously studied yb - based heavy fermion compounds .",
    "one of the expressions considered in the scaling analysis at a qcp@xcite is the cross - over function @xmath82~/~t$ ] _ vs. _ @xmath83 . in the case of ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite",

    "the analogous @xmath87 t range is drastically reduced ( 1@xmath10 t @xmath81 0.3 k@xmath84 ) , making the unambiguous determination of the critical exponent @xmath88 essentially impossible .",
    "low - temperature resistivity curves for different values of the applied magnetic field are shown in fig.[f12 ] .",
    "the @xmath89 data are consistent with the presence of two magnetic phase transitions at low fields ; the small arrows indicate these transition temperature values , as determined from maxima in the d@xmath90 .",
    "both these transitions are suppressed by increasing applied field . whereas the upper transition can still be detected for h @xmath91 kg , a field of about 20",
    "kg is sufficient to drive the lower one below our base temperature of 0.4 k. it is worth noting that the critical field h@xmath92 kg , determined from the @xmath31(t , h ) data as the field required to suppress the magnetic ordering , is close to the position of the qcp as inferred based on the c@xmath30 data ( fig.[f11]-[f11a ] ) .    as fig.[f12sqab",
    "] indicates , when the magnetic field is increased beyond h@xmath4 , the temperature dependence of the resistivity is ambiguous ; particularly at fields just above h@xmath4 ( h @xmath93 100 kg ) , it is difficult to distinguish between linear or quadratic behavior of the resistivity as a function of temperature .",
    "consequently we leave the complete analysis of the temperature - dependent resistivity outside the ordered state for the discussion section .",
    "when magnetoresistance measurements ( @xmath94 ) are performed ( fig.[f13 ] ) three features are apparent at very low temperatures , as indicated for t = 0.4 k by the small arrows . the inset shows @xmath31(h ) at t = 0.8 k , to exemplify how these transition temperatures were inferred from these data . for t @xmath80 1 k ,",
    "the two lower transitions merge and the resulting one is still distinguishable up to approximately 1.4 k. the upper transition moves down towards zero field as the temperature approaches t@xmath95 k.    based on the above field- and temperature - dependent thermodynamic and transport measurements , a @xmath96 phase diagram for @xmath21 can be constructed ( fig.[f14 ] ) : in zero magnetic field , two magnetic phase transitions can be observed , around t@xmath95 k and t@xmath97 k. increasing magnetic field splits the lower transition into two separate ones around h @xmath98 kg ; one of these phase lines drops towards our lowest temperature at almost constant field , whereas the second one has a slower decrease with field , such that it approaches t = 0.4 k around h = 20 kg . in a similar manner ,",

    "high torques on this sample for this orientation of the field prevented us from completing these measurements up to 140 kg .",
    "moreover , as will be shown below , there are significant discrepancies between the transition temperatures determined even from the intermediate - field specific heat data and transport measurements ( _ i.e. _ , for h @xmath80 40 kg ) .",
    "this observation prompts us to suspect that significant torques may have changed the sample orientation for the specific heat measurements , even for fields significantly lower than 80 kg .    in zero field",
    ", we can confirm the two magnetic transitions observed before , at t@xmath95 k , and t@xmath97 k respectively ; as the small arrows indicate , the lower - t transition is driven down in field , and falls below 0.4 k for h @xmath101 kg , whereas the upper transition persists above 80 kg .",
    "the temperature and field dependent resistivity data ( fig.[f21]-[f21rh ] ) indicate a much slower suppression of the magnetic order with the applied field . in fig.[f21]a ,",
    "@xmath68 curves are shown , with the arrows indicating the transition temperatures as determined from @xmath102 .",
    "fig.[f21]b presents a subset of these derivatives , to illustrate the criteria for determining the temperatures : for the lower transition , a peak in @xmath102 broadens as field is increased , and disappears for h @xmath103 80 kg ; the upper transition is marked by a step in these derivatives , which also broadens as h increases . at the highest measured field ( _ i.e. _ , 140 kg ) we are unable to distinguish between a very broad step ( with a possible transition temperature marked by the small arrow ) or a cross - over in corresponding @xmath102 .",
    "the field - dependent resistivity data ( fig.[f21rh ] ) are indicative of a low temperature transition consistent with that seen in @xmath68 , with the critical fields determined from onsets .    given the above c@xmath30(t , h ) and @xmath31(t , h ) data , we suspect that magnetic fields h @xmath103 20 kg deform the four wires supporting the he-3 specific heat platform used for the c@xmath30(t , h ) measurements , whereas the resistivity sample appears to be well held in place by grease on the rigid platform .",
    "consequently , at high fields , the two sets of data ( c@xmath30(t , h ) and @xmath31(t , h ) ) may not correspond to the same orientation of the field ( @xmath41 ) , yielding different transition temperature values for the corresponding applied fields .    as a result ,",

    "two transitions can be observed in fig.[f22 ] , at low fields , around 3.4 k , and 1.4 k respectively . as h",
    "is being increased , the low temperature line slowly approaches t = 0 around h @xmath107 kg .",
    "the step in @xmath102 associated with the upper transition ( fig.[f21]b ) broadens as the field increases , resulting in increasingly large error bars in determining these transition temperatures .",
    "as already mentioned , it is uncertain if the transition persists up to h = 140 kg , or if cross - over occurs between 120 and 140 kg .      * @xmath39 * + given the differences between ybptin and ybpt@xmath1 in evidenced by both thermodynamic and transport data ( figs.[f01]-[frt300 ] ) , it is desirable to compare similar measurements on the two compounds , and to study the effect of the small stoichiometry change on the field - induced qcp .",
    "consequently , in fig.[f03 ] we present the low - temperature specific heat data of ybpt@xmath1 in , for various values of the applied field h @xmath108 .",
    "a well - defined peak at t @xmath109 k in the h @xmath110 data may be associated with the magnetic ordering of this compound . as the applied magnetic field is increased , this transition ( indicated by small arrows ) moves to lower temperatures , and eventually drops below 0.4 k around 35 kg . from the linear extrapolation of the h = 0 data from t @xmath111 k down to t = 0 ( inset , fig.[f03]a ) , we can estimate the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath72 as @xmath112 mj / mol k@xmath11 . fig.[f03]b the magnetic specific heat data for the same field values , @xmath74(ybpt@xmath1in)@xmath75(luptin ) , plotted as c@xmath113 _ vs. _ t@xmath11 .",

    "it thus appears that the largest temperature region ( close to a decade ) for the logarithmic divergency of the c@xmath113 data may occur for some intermediate field value ( 35 kg @xmath81 h @xmath81 40 kg ) .",

    "the case of ybptin , in ybpt@xmath1 in the temperature dependence of the resistivity outside the ordered state is ambiguous . from figs.[f04]b-[f04sqab ] it is unclear whether the resistivity is linear or quadratic in field for h @xmath123 , particularly for intermediate field values ( h @xmath106 55 kg ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the resistivity data above the critical field will be performed in the discussion section , for both compounds .",
    "this should allow us to better clarify the position of the qcp and the existence of a fermi liquid - like ( fl ) regime in these systems .",
    "transverse magnetoresistance measurements were taken at constant temperatures ranging from 0.4 k to 10 k. as shown in fig.[f05 ] , two different temperature regimes can be identified in these data : for t @xmath124 k ( fig.[f05]a ) , two transitions can be distinguished .",
    "the small arrows mark the positions for these two transitions for t = 0.4 k , whereas the inset illustrates how these critical field values were determined .",
    "as the temperature increases up to about 1.8 k , the upper transition moves down in field and broadens , whereas the position of the lower one seems almost unaffected by the change in temperature . for temperatures higher than 2",

    "as in the case of the stoichiometric compound , significant torques on the specific heat platform and sample for h @xmath80 50 kg may be the cause of the different transition temperature values , as determined by the two data sets mentioned above . therefore we will only take into consideration c@xmath30(t , h ) data for h @xmath81 50 kg ( fig.[f17 ] ) .",
    "similar to the @xmath39 measurements ( fig.[f03 ] ) , the @xmath41 c@xmath30 curves reveal a magnetic transition around 2.1 k for h = 0 ( fig.[f17 ] ) , which drops to @xmath19 2 k for h = 40 kg , before the sample torques significantly ; small arrows indicate the position of the transition temperature for the three curves shown in fig.[f17 ]",
    ".    the temperature and field dependent resistivity data ( fig.[f18 ] ) indicate a slow suppression of the magnetic order with the applied field .",
    "fig.[f18]a shows the @xmath31(t ) curves in various applied fields , with the large circles marking the phase transition as determined from d@xmath90 ; the inset illustrates how the transition temperature was determined for h = 0 . the critical field required to suppress this transition below our base temperature appears to be around 120 kg .",
    "given the limited temperature range at these high fields , for h = 130 and 140 kg we were unable to distinguish a linear or quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "the magnetoresistance isotherms are presented in fig.[f18]b , and the large squares on this plot also indicate the high - t magnetic phase transition ; in the inset , a few d@xmath126 curves are shown to illustrate how the critical field values for the transition were determined .    based on the c@xmath30(t , h ) and @xmath31(t , h ) presented above , the @xmath41 t - h phase diagram for ybpt@xmath1 in can be obtained , as shown in fig.[f19 ] . at low fields ,",
    "this t - h phase diagram is consistent with the in - plane one for this compound : a magnetic transition is apparent around 2.2 k , but the possible second one around 1.0 k is not visible in the h@xmath0c measurements ; the t @xmath127 2.2 k transition is driven down in temperature by increasing applied fields , and it approaches our base temperature ( _ i.e. _ , 0.4 k ) around 120 kg .",
    "lack of measurements below 0.4 k or above 140 kg limits our ability to probe the existence of a qcp in this orientation , similar to the one at h@xmath128 kg for @xmath39 .",
    "for both the ybptin and ybpt@xmath1 in compounds a number of similar properties , as well as systematic differences , could be distinguished .",
    "first , the small stoichiometry difference was apparent from single crystal x - ray measurements , which also resulted in slightly reduced lattice parameters and unit cell volumes in the ybptin system .",
    "furthermore , the resistivity values were shifted towards higher values in the pt - deficient compound ( figs.[f02]b-[frt300 ] ) for the whole temperature ( t = 0.4 - 300 k ) and field ranges ( h = 0 - 140 kg ) of our measurements .",
    "high enough fields suppressed the magnetic order in both systems , at least for field applied within the basal plane ; in a similar manner to the t - scale in these compounds , the critical field value was reduced in ybpt@xmath1 in by comparison to the analogous one in ybptin . for @xmath129 , the field values required to suppress the magnetic order in ybpt@xmath1 in and ybptin were close to , or respectively higher than our maximum available field ( _ i.e. _ , 140 kg ) ; this precluded us from studying the low temperature properties of the two compounds outside the ordered state , for this orientation of the field .    for @xmath39 nfl - like behavior seems to occur in ybpt@xmath1 in for intermediate field values above the ordering temperatures , as indicated by the logarithmic divergence of the c@xmath113 data ( fig.[f03b]a ) . in ybptin",
    "the nfl region is less clearly defined in the specific heat , as its logarithmic divergence was limited to a small temperature range by a downturn in the c@xmath130 data ( fig.[f11a ] ) towards high t. even more ambiguous was the temperature dependence of the resistivity data in both compounds , for h @xmath123 .",
    "below we are presenting a detailed analysis of these data , aimed at distinguishing between , if existent , the nfl and fl regimes , and providing a more accurate estimate of the qcp position in each of the two compounds",
    ".      given the ambiguity already mentioned in the power law that best describes @xmath68 data above the ordered state , we attempt to determine the exponent @xmath88 when the temperature dependence of the resistivity is given by : @xmath131 , where @xmath132 .",
    "this is best done by determining the slope of the @xmath133 data on log - log plots at various field values .",
    "however , the accuracy of the resulting @xmath134 values is highly dependent on accurate estimates of the residual resistivity values @xmath135 . in turn , the estimates of the @xmath135 values are made difficult by their enhanced values compared to the over - all resistivity values ( fig.[frt300 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we determine the residual resistivity values using two criteria : firstly , from fits of the low - t resistivity data to a @xmath136 function ; secondly , given that figs.[f04]b-[f04sqab ] ( for ybpt@xmath1 in ) , or fig.[f12sqab ] ( for ybptin ) suggests that low - t @xmath68 data are close to being either linear or quadratic in t , we also choose ( for mathematical rather than physical reasons ) a second - order polynomial function to determine @xmath137 as a function of field : @xmath138 .",
    "for each field value , the average @xmath137 resulting from the two aforementioned criteria is used to calculate @xmath132 plotted in fig.[f04sqcd]a and [ f12sqcd]a respectively , on a log - log scale .",
    "the large data scattering towards the lowest temperatures , particularly at high fields , is due to the fact that @xmath139 is calculated as the difference between two comparably large values , @xmath68 and @xmath137 . as a consequence",
    ", the values of the exponent @xmath88 are being determined from ( i ) linear fits shown as solid lines , for @xmath132 larger than @xmath19 0.1 @xmath140 ( marked by the dashed horizontal line ) , and ( ii ) from similar linear fits down to the lowest measured temperature ( dotted lines ) .",
    "together with the exponent values originally determined from fitting the low - t data to @xmath136 functions , we can now determine the @xmath88 values shown in fig.[f04sqcd]b and [ f12sqcd]b , as full symbols , with their corresponding error bars .    in the case of ybpt@xmath1 in ( fig.[f04sqcd]a ) , the resistivity is linear on the log - log scale , up to some maximum temperatures t@xmath141 marked with large triangles , with a large change in slope for 60 kg @xmath81 h @xmath81 70 kg .",
    "this is equivalent to the exponent @xmath88 having a discontinuous change from @xmath142 below 60 kg ( _ i.e. , _ for h @xmath103 h@xmath4 ) , to @xmath143 in higher fields ( h @xmath144 h@xmath4 ) , as can be seen in fig.[f04sqcd]b . also shown in fig.[f04sqcd]b are the temperatures t@xmath141 below which the low - temperature @xmath145 manifests a fermi liquid - like exponent of @xmath146 2 , analogous to the cross - over previously reported for ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite . the departure from linearity on the resistivity plots can be determined up to a temperature range , and not a unique temperature value , which results in finite error bars on these cross - over temperatures . however , a monotonic increase of the cross - over temperatures with field is observed , with the corresponding error bars also increasing . when adding this cross - over line to the h - t phase diagram ( see below fig.[f09 ] , full triangles ) , it appears to converge with the magnetic order upper boundary ( solid line ) around the qcp between 45 and 70 kg .",
    "when we describe the ybptin low - t resistivity data as @xmath147 for h @xmath103 h@xmath4 , we encounter a situation very similar to that seen in ybpt@xmath1 in : the logarithmic plot in fig.[f12sqcd]a , linear at low t , is indicative of a jump in slope for an applied field between 70 kg and 80 kg , where the slope gives the values of the exponent @xmath88 .",
    "it appears that the exponent @xmath88 has a discontinuous variation with field ( fig.[f12sqcd]b ( left ) ) from @xmath148 for h @xmath103 h@xmath4 , to @xmath149 when h @xmath144 h@xmath4 .",
    "this suggests a nfl - like regime just above the magnetically ordered state , with a cross - over to a fl state above 100 kg , making this compound fairly similar to the pt - deficient one , but also to the previously reported ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite .",
    "as observed before for ybpt@xmath1 in , due to the data scattering , the departure of the low temperature resistivity plots from the fl - like @xmath146 2 behavior at the highest field allows us to determine a cross - over temperature range , rather than a temperature value .",
    "this results in finite error bars on the cross - over temperatures , as seen in fig.[f12sqcd]b ( right )",
    ". however , an increase of the cross - over temperatures with field is observed , both in fig.[f12sqcd]b , and also in the revised h - t phase diagram ( fig.[f14beta ] ) ( full symbols ) .",
    "based on the low temperature thermodynamic and transport measurements , ybptin and ybpt@xmath1 in can be regarded as yb - based heavy fermion compounds with long range , possibly reduced moment ordering that can be driven through a field - induced quantum critical point , similar to the previously studied yb - based hf systems , ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite . in the latter two compounds , the hall effect served as an additional tool for characterizing the qcp and its effects on the finite - temperature properties of these materials .    in order to further explore the field - induced qcp",
    "our yb - based compounds , field - dependent hall resistivity measurements were performed for temperatures up to 300 k. however , the data on the stoichiometric compound was noisy , given the limited ( small ) crystal size , and meaningful hall resistivity data could only be collected for the solution - grown compound for h @xmath108 .",
    "these measurements are shown in fig.[f07 ] .",
    "we determined the hall coefficient r@xmath150 for ybpt@xmath1 in as @xmath151 , in the low - field ( h @xmath152 kg ) and high - field ( h @xmath153 kg ) regimes , shown in fig.[f07 ] for various t. ( this alternative definition for the r@xmath154 was preferred to @xmath155 due to the scattering of the data at low fields as seen later in fig.[f08]b ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[f10 ] on a semi - log scale .",
    "the high - h points ( squares ) show the expected leveling off of r@xmath154 as @xmath156 , whereas the low - h data appear to have a stronger temperature dependence . at temperatures",
    "higher than 25 k , the two data sets merge ( as the @xmath157 data become roughly linear for the whole field range [ fig.[f07]a ] ) .",
    "these data indicate that the field - dependent hall resistivity will be non - trivial and potentially of interest at low temperatures .",
    "in the field - dependent hall resistivity measurements shown in fig.[f07 ] , two possible regimes can be distinguished : a high - t regime ( t @xmath158 k ) , where a monotonic decrease with field can be observed , despite the scattering of the data ( fig.[f07]a ) , and a low - t regime ( t @xmath159 k ) , for which a minimum in the @xmath160h ) data appears and sharpens as the temperature decreases ( fig.[f07]b ) . for 5 k @xmath106 t @xmath106 25 k",
    ", the hall resistivity curves show a fairly broad minimum ( fig.[f07]b ) , marked by the large gray dots , which moves down in field with decreasing temperature . below 5 k , this minimum is more and more pronounced , and is almost unaffected by the change in temperature .",
    "coleman _ _ et al.__@xcite have indicated that r@xmath150(c ) data ( where c is a control parameter , _",
    "i.e. , _ h in our case ) can be used to distinguish between two possible qcp scenarios : diffraction off of a critical spin density wave sdw ( manifesting as a change in the slope of r@xmath150(c ) at c@xmath18 ) or a breakdown of the composite nature of the heavy electron ( signaled by the divergence of the slope of r@xmath150(c ) at c@xmath18 ) . in our case , it is not clear what definition of the hall coefficient should be used for comparison with the theory ( _ i.e. _ , either r@xmath161 or r@xmath162 ) since the magnetic field h is itself the control parameter c. therefore in fig.[f08 ] we are presenting the r@xmath150(h ) curves determined using both of the aforementioned definitions .",
    "( fig.[f08]a ) , the hall coefficient is linear up to a field value which varies non - monotonically with t , as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "this line is shifted to higher field values with respect to the hall resistivity line ( fig.[f08]a ) , and is marked here by the large diamonds .",
    "when using the r@xmath150(h)@xmath164 definition for the hall coefficient ( fig.[f08]b ) , the maximum - h points on the low - field linear fits could be used as the criterium for defining the hall line ( indicated by the dotted line ) .",
    "regardless of what criterium is being used , the hall measurements define a new phase line , distinct from any of the ones inferred from either the c@xmath30(t , h ) or the @xmath31(h , t ) data .",
    "fig.[hallht ] shows the @xmath96 phase diagram with the phase lines determined from the @xmath31(h , t ) ( h @xmath165 ) or the c@xmath30(t , h ) data ( lines ) , together with the cross - over line and the hall line inferred from the various definitions ( symbols ) .",
    "the line resulting from the hall resistivity @xmath32 data ( diamonds ) seems to persist even below t@xmath12 , down to our lowest t. however , the other two criteria used for the definition of the hall line ( r@xmath166 or h@xmath141 for the linear fit of r@xmath167 ) delineate lines , which more closely resembles the hall line observed for either ybrh@xmath15si@xmath15@xcite and ybagge@xcite as it appears to converge with the `` coherence '' line ( _ i.e. _ , the line defining the cross - over between the non - fermi liquid and fermi - liquid like regimes ) , and the high - t magnetic ordering phase boundary , at the qcp , around h@xmath4 .",
    "it should be noted , though that , unlike ybagge , for which the hall line is clearly not associated with the saturation of the yb moments@xcite , for ybpt@xmath1 in the hall line appears to be close to the saturation fields , at least at the lowest temperatures .",
    "based on the presented data , we can conclude that , in both ybpt@xmath1 in and ybptin , when magnetic field is increased above @xmath168 , the system first enters a nfl state , followed , at higher fields , by a fl - like state : the specific heat has a logarithmic divergence ( figs.[f03b ] and [ f11a ] ) and the resistivity shows a @xmath169 functional dependence ( fig.[f04sqcd]a , b and [ f12sqcd]a , b ) , with @xmath88 having a discontinuous change at intermediate field values , from @xmath148 to @xmath170 2 .",
