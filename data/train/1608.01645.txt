    "<S> given that no breathing distortion is introduced yet in this plot , the peak arises due to non - local excitations between the two clusters . </S>",
    "<S> such an effect is perhaps not surprising , given the negative charge transfer energy and strong covalence , but it demonstrates that even in the absence of breathing distortions , a proper interpretation of the spectra of high valence transition metal oxides might require at least a double cluster model where such excitations can be captured . </S>",
    "<S> similar inter - site effects requiring extensions beyond the single cluster approximation were recently identified in the xas of strongly covalent mixed valence systems @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig : spec](b ) shows the effect of the breathing distortion on the xas spectra . in the presence of the distortion </S>",
    "<S> there are distinct spectra , one arising from each of the two inequivalent sites , and as such we show these two spectra , along with their sum . here </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the spectrum from the long ( short ) bond octahedron shifts to lower ( higher ) energies as the breathing distortion is increased . in the extreme case , </S>",
    "<S> the sharp pre - peak arises entirely from the long bond ni . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is in excellent agreement with the nickelate phase diagram , where smaller rare earths lead to larger breathing distortions and a larger separation of the xas peaks @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : spec](c ) details the magnetic response for the same three breathing distortions of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spec](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total xas is shown again for comparison , and the site - decomposed mcd spectra are shown . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the tendency toward @xmath11 and @xmath14 moments on the short and long bond sites , as was shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , the mcd spectrum of the long ( short ) bond site becomes stronger ( weaker ) as the breathing distortion is introduced . as the long bond site contributes the most to the sharp first peak , the mcd response is then concentrated mostly on that peak as well . for comparison to experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we also show the calculated resonant magnetic diffraction ( rmd ) response , which peaks strongly at the xas first peak and has a weak shoulder at higher energies , in excellent agreement with previous experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the effects of intercluster hopping on the xas spectra of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spec](a ) demonstrate the importance of non - local excitations and accordingly suggest a highly covalent nature of the ground state captured in our double cluster model . </S>",
    "<S> we verify this in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : char ] by a decompositional analysis of the ground state wavefunction . within the configuration interaction approach taken here , </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction is built up of determinants belonging to specific electronic configurations . in conventional single cluster theory , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is thus given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 gives the weight of configuration @xmath41 . in the nickelates , @xmath42 , and one is therefore limited to 4 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of these configurations in the single cluster limit of our model are plotted on the right in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : char](a ) . in green </S>",
    "<S> we show the calculations including electron - electron correlations , i.e. the hamiltonian including the full coulomb interaction is solved by exact diagonalization . in red </S>",
    "<S> we show the weight of the different configurations approximating the coulomb interaction by a potential as one would do in a local density or hartree - fock approximation . </S>",
    "<S> correlations induced by the coulomb interaction reduce the amount of charge fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> one configuration gains more weight , reducing the weight of all others and thus changing the variance of the ni @xmath43 electron count . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly it is not the @xmath44 configuration that gains the most weight in the strongly correlated limit , but the @xmath45 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the local symmetry is still that of a @xmath44 configuration , i.g . @xmath46 and one has a local doublet , defining the formal valence to be ni@xmath6 .    in the double cluster model many more configurations are possible ( @xmath47 , in general ) due to charge fluctuations between the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the configuration weights for the double cluster model with no breathing distortion on the left in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : char](a ) . again correlations ( green ) reduce the amount of charge fluctuations on the ni site and , like the single cluster calculation , the @xmath48 configurations have the most weight . </S>",
    "<S> the ligand charge fluctuations are not reduced between the correlated ( green ) and uncorrelated ( red ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the local state can thus be thought of as a superposition of @xmath49 , @xmath45 , @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> magnetically the local cluster state is thus a superposition of a triplet , doublet and singlet with ni - ligand cluster formal valences of 2 + , 3 + , and 4 + respectively .     </S>",
    "<S> are compared for the present double cluster model ( left , green ) and conventional ligand field theory ( right , green ) , demonstrating the new determinants which arise in negative charge transfer situations not captured by single cluster theory . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the weights for the non - interacting approximation are shown in red for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> divisions on the bars have values of 0.05 for the double cluster and 0.10 for the single . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the compressed octahedron exhibits a wavefunction with dominant ligand hole - rich @xmath48 determinants , while the expanded octahedron has a much more ionic wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> , width=324 ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : char](b ) , we show the effects of the breathing distortion on the @xmath48 derived configurations of the double cluster model . as demonstrated above , for no breathing distortion </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong mixture of configurations ( high covalency ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , upon the introduction of the breathing distortion the ligand hole character strongly shifts , such that the compressed octahedron has mostly @xmath8 ( and to a lesser extent , @xmath51 ) character ( reflecting what was shown in fig . [ fig:1](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expanded octahedron , however , becomes much more ionic , being dominated by the @xmath9 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> it is this ionic character of the long bond sublattice which has led to suggestions that the nickelate mit can be described as a _ site selective _ </S>",
    "<S> mott transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , given the active oxygen electronic structure due to the negative charge transfer energy , and the lattice breathing distortion , the mit might be more aptly described as peierls - like .    </S>",
    "<S> our double cluster model bridges the gap between electronic structure experiments and theories of negative charge transfer and bond disproportionation in the rare earth nickelates . by accounting for self - doped holes in the oxygen @xmath0 band as well as structural breathing distortions , </S>",
    "<S> we find pronounced bond disproportionation effects in the ground state , including unequal spin moments on the two sublattices in excellent agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we show the effect of bond disproportionation on the soft x - ray spectral response , again finding excellent agreement with experiment and providing a tool for future studies of engineered phases . the highly covalent wavefunctions and non - local excitations captured by the double cluster model developed here </S>",
    "<S> show that it will be important for other high oxidation state transition metal oxides , even in the absence of breathing distortions . </S>",
    "<S> new insights into highly studied materials such as perovskite manganates , ferrates , cobaltates , etc . , and their resonant scattering responses , should also be captured by the model .    </S>",
