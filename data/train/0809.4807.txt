    "due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels , the issues of privacy and security in wireless networks have taken on an increasingly important role , especially in military and homeland security applications .",
    "physical ( phy ) layer based security using an information - theoretic point of view is attracting much attention in this context .",
    "the basic idea of phy - based security is to exploit the physical characteristics of the wireless channel . in the real world , signals transmitted over physical channels experience impairments such as channel fading and additive noise . while channel fading and thermal noise have traditionally been viewed as impediments , phy layer security approaches can exploit these channel characteristics in order to enhance the security of digital communication systems .",
    "this line of work was pioneered by wyner , who introduced the wiretap channel and established the possibility of creating almost perfectly secure communication links without relying on private ( secret ) keys @xcite .",
    "wyner showed that when the eavesdropper channel is a degraded version of the main channel , the source and destination can exchange perfectly secure messages at a non - zero rate , while the eavesdropper can learn almost nothing about the messages from its observations .",
    "the maximal rate of secrecy information from the source to its intended destination is defined by the term _",
    "secrecy capacity_. follow - up work by leung - yan - cheong and hellman characterized the secrecy capacity of scalar gaussian wire - tap channel @xcite . in a further paper , csiszr and krner generalized wyner s approach by considering the transmission of confidential messages over broadcast channels",
    "recently , there have been considerable efforts devoted to generalizing these studies to the wireless channel and multi - user scenarios ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the feasibility of traditional phy - based security approaches based on single antenna systems is hampered by channel conditions : if the channel between source and destination is worse than the channel between source and eavesdropper , the secrecy capacity is typical zero @xcite,@xcite .",
    "some recent work has been proposed to overcome this limitation by taking advantage of multiple antenna systems , e.g. , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) @xcite,@xcite , single - input multiple - output ( simo ) @xcite and multiple - input single - output ( miso ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , due to cost and size limitations , multiple antennas may not be available at network nodes .",
    "under such scenarios , node cooperation is an effective way to enable single - antenna nodes to enjoy the benefits of multiple - antenna systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a situation in which each network node is equipped with only a single omni - directional antenna and there are one or more eavesdroppers in the network .",
    "secure communication is achieved via node cooperation in a decode - and - forward ( df ) fashion .",
    "we assume that source and relays are located in the same cluster , while destination and eavesdropper(s ) are at faraway locations outside this cluster .",
    "we propose a two - stage cooperative protocol . in stage 1 ,",
    "the source node broadcasts its message locally to other nodes within the cluster .",
    "these local transmissions typically require a small amount of power only , and the information rate at faraway eavesdropper(s ) can be ignored .",
    "thus , transmissions in stage 1 can be considered to be secure . in stage 2 ,",
    "relay nodes decode the received messages .",
    "then , the source node and relay nodes cooperatively transmit a weighted version of the message signal to the destination .",
    "our focus is on secret communications in stage 2 .",
    "we are interested in two optimization problems : ( 1 ) design node weights to maximize the secrecy capacity for a fixed transmit power ; and ( 2 ) design node weights to minimize the transmit power for a fixed secrecy capacity .",
    "we assume that the global channel state information ( csi ) is available for weight design .",
    "cooperation is here used in place of multiple transmit antennas in miso systems .",
    "since there is a step involved before transmission , during which the information is made available to the relays , the corresponding secrecy capacity is half of that corresponding to a miso system .",
    "we should also point out that existing results for system design for a centralized miso system can be also applied in system design for df - based cooperative protocols .",
    "for example , in the case of one eavesdropper , the closed - form expression for weights that maximize the secrecy capacity subject to a transmit power constraint has been studied in @xcite , @xcite . beyond existing results in @xcite,@xcite , we here propose the following new results for the df - based cooperative protocol : ( 1 ) for the case of one eavesdropper , we study system design to minimize the transmit power for a fixed secrecy capacity .",
    "we propose an iterative algorithm to reach the optimal solution , by using the solution for the problem of maximizing the secrecy capacity for a fixed transmit power .",
    "( 2 ) prior work considered the presence of one eavesdropper only . for the case of multiple eavesdroppers , the aforementioned optimization problems are in general intractable .",
    "we obtain a suboptimal ( in terms of secrecy capacity or transmit power ) but simple closed - form solution , by introducing an additional constraint , i.e. , complete nulling of signals at all eavesdroppers .",
    "( 3 ) prior work assumed either complete knowledge of the eavesdroppers channels , or only the channel statistics . in this paper , we investigate the weight design for the more practical case in which only imperfect estimates of eavesdroppers channels are available .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ df - protocol ] , the system model and the df - based cooperative protocol is described . in section [ systemdesign ] ,",
    "single and multiple eavesdroppers cases are investigated for the secrecy capacity maximization problem and the power minimization problem .",
    "the case of imperfect csi of eavesdroppers is also studied .",
    "simulations are described in section [ sec : simulation ] , and conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "we consider a wireless network model consisting of one source node ( node index : 0 ) , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) trusted relay nodes ( node index @xmath14 ) , a destination node , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) eavesdroppers .",

    ", destination - related csi can be obtained by periodic pilots , and eavesdroppers - related csi and the number of eavesdroppers may be obtained by monitoring the behavior of eavesdroppers . a cluster head ( ch ) then collects the global csi , executes the weight computation algorithm and sends the weights back to cluster nodes for cooperative transmissions .    a df - based cooperative protocol will be used .",
    "the number of relays with successful decoding is assumed to be known a priori ( rather than being a random variable ) . to implement this in practice ,",
    "each relay with successful decoding can send a non - interfering notification message to the ch .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe the df - based cooperative transmission protocol based on our system model .",
    "* stage 1 * : the source broadcasts its message signal @xmath17 locally to its trusted relays within the cluster .",
    "the transmit power is chosen so that the signal @xmath17 can be decoded at the relays with high probability . in this paper , for simplicity we assume that the transmit power in stage 1 is known a priori .",
    "this stage usually requires a small amount of power only , and the information rate at the faraway eavesdropper(s ) can be ignored .",

    "then , totally @xmath25 nodes ( @xmath12 relays plus one source ) , indexed by @xmath26 , participate in cooperative transmissions in stage 2 .",

    "in this section , we discuss the weight design for the df - based cooperative protocol to achieve secure wireless communications , for the cases of one eavesdropper and multiple eavesdroppers , respectively .",
