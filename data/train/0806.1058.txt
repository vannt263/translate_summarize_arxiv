    "only when feynman @xcite had published his paper on vortices in superfluid helium , did landau agree and abrikosov could publish his solution in 1957 @xcite . for his prediction of the vortex lattice",
    "abrikosov 50 years later in 2003 received the nobel prize in physics together with vitalii ginzburg and anthony leggett .",
    "after first evidence of the triangular vortex lattice in superconducting niobium by small - angle neutron scattering in saclay @xcite , truble and essmann in stuttgart succeeded @xcite to observe the vortex lattice directly by decorating the surface of a superconductor with iron microcrystallites ( `` magnetic smoke '' ) .",
    "at that time i joined this research group headed by a.  seeger and wrote my thesis on the theory of defects in the vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "parts 1 and 2 deal with low inductions @xmath19 when london theory may be used and the vortices interact with each other pairwise , similar to 2d atomic lattices .",
    "parts 3 and 4 consider high inductions @xmath20 , where the shape of the gl solutions @xmath6 and @xmath21 may be obtained from linearized gl theory , while the nonlinear gl terms determine the amplitudes of this @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "my thesis extended abrikosov s theory of periodic vortex lattices to non - periodic vortex arrangements , see below .",
    "such distorted - lattice solutions are required to calculate the elastic energy of the vortex lattice and the energy of lattice defects like vacancies and dislocations .",

    "obviously , if the other vortices are not allowed to relax , this solution at large distances vanishes as @xmath107 ; it can not be normalized and its energy is infinite .",
    "however , if the relaxation of the other vortices is chosen appropriately it will minimize the defect energy and make it finite .",
    "this can be seen from the solution @xmath109 the constant factor @xmath110 was added to force convergence of the infinite product .",
    "the solution for a super lattice of vacancies positioned at the @xmath111 , is given by expression ( 13 ) divided by @xmath112 that removes the zeros at positions @xmath113 ..    the energy of both the ideally periodic and the distorted vortex lattices is calculated via the abrikosov parameter @xmath114 this @xmath115 enters the free energy of the linearized gl theory ( referred to the normal state ) , that has to be minimized when @xmath0 is held constant , @xmath116}\\ ] ] and the free enthalpy that has to be minimized when @xmath7 is held constant , @xmath117 the elastic energy of the distorted vortex lattice is the product of the derivatives @xmath118 or @xmath119 times the change of @xmath120 times the volume , with the limit of infinite volume taken .",
    "this means that all elastic energies and energies of structural defects near @xmath24 vanish as @xmath121 .",
    "this is true also for the shear modulus @xmath122 of the vortex lattice , which can be obtained using abrikosov s periodic lattice solution @xcite .    in the case of the vortex vacancy ,",
    "the resulting defect energy is finite only if the vortices relax ( shift towards the removed vortex ) such that at large distances ( and after numerical minimization practically at all distances ) the vortex displacements are @xmath123 with @xmath124 the vortex density .",
    "if the radial displacements were chosen smaller ( larger ) than in ( 19 ) , the order parameter ( 15 ) would vanish ( diverge ) at large distances @xmath125 . but with the correct displacements that minimize @xmath115 and thus the defect energy , the amplitude of the oscillating order parameter stays almost constant , even near the vacancy .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  1 , where the profiles of @xmath126 along @xmath127 are plotted for ideal triangular vortex lattice and for the lattice with a central vacancy with the simple relaxation ( 19 ) and with an improved relaxation field @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "figure 2 shows the contour lines of the fully relaxed order parameter @xmath126 , which has a maximum at the origin ( vacancy position ) and minima ( zeros ) at the vortex positions .",
    "the displacement ( 19 ) means that the area of the `` relaxing ring '' , @xmath129 , exactly equals the area of one lattice cell . in other words ,",
    "the removal of one vortex at @xmath130 is compensated by the relaxation of the surrounding vortices such that the average vortex density in any contour ( containing or not containing the vacancy ) stays constant and equals the density @xmath131 that was there before the vacancy was introduced .",
    "note that the field ( 19 ) satisfies @xmath132 , and thus describes a pure shear deformation .",
    "more precisely , one has @xmath133",
    "( @xmath134 is the 2d delta function ) , i.e. , the displacement field ( 19 ) `` remembers '' that one vortex cell area was removed .",
    "further interesting properties of structural defects in vortex lattices and other two- or three - dimensional soft lattices are discussed in [ 10 ] .",
    "as shown with the vacancy example , the distorted - lattice solution ( 14 ) of the linearized gl equations yields finite energies of lattice defects only if most of the vortex displacements are allowed to relax appropriately .",
    "but without this relaxation , the elastic energy is infinite .",
    "for example , if only the one vortex at the origin is displaced , @xmath135 ( @xmath136 if @xmath137 , else @xmath138 ) one has from ( 14 ) @xmath139 i.e. , the periodic order parameter is modulated by a slowly decreasing function .",
    "the abrikosov @xmath115 of this defect times the volume , @xmath140 , diverges and so the defect energy diverges .",
    "this unphysical divergence of defect energies of the vortex lattice is removed when the influence of the nonlinear gl terms on the solutions @xmath126 and @xmath21 is accounted for .",
    "this calculation was performed in a series of 4 papers @xcite : parts 1 and 2 deal with the linear elastic energy of the vortex lattice at low and high inductions @xmath0 .",
    "parts 3 and 4 derive the gl solutions for the distorted vortex lattice when the vortex lines are straight and parallel or arbitrarily curved .",
    "the essential result is that the long - ranging modulation factors like @xmath141 in the linearized solution ( 14 ) become exponentially damped over a new length @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "as @xmath144 , this screening length becomes infinite and the linearized solution ( 14 ) is recovered . at @xmath145 , the distorted - lattice solution ( 14 ) should be replaced by @xmath146 ^ 2                               + o(s^2 ) \\",

    "the iteration is stable and converges rapidly if one isolates a term @xmath305 on the l.h.s .  and puts the remaining terms to the r.h.s .  as an `` inhomogeneity '' of such london - like equations , e.g. , @xmath306 with the abbreviations @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , and @xmath310 .",

    "next we allow for the terms with @xmath424 .",
    "this yields a `` mushrooming '' of the field lines of each vortex when it approaches the film surface such that these lines smoothly cross the surface with no bend , see right part of fig .",
    "9 .    profiles @xmath425 and @xmath426 are shown in fig .  10 for @xmath427 ( middle plane of the film ) and @xmath428 ( film surface ) .",
    "one can see that the spatial variation of @xmath23 at the surface is reduced from its bulk value by nearly @xmath429 . outside the film , the transverse field components @xmath430 , @xmath431 rapidly decrease as @xmath432 where @xmath433 is the distance from the surface .",
    "interestingly , the profile of the order parameter @xmath313 in films is almost independent of @xmath8 .",
    "the shear modulus @xmath122 of the triangular vortex lattice in films can be positive even when @xmath434 , provided the film thickness @xmath397 is smaller than the coherence length @xmath435 , see fig .",
    "this means that a stable vortex lattice may exist in thin type - i superconductor films .",
    "our numerical result confirms the @xmath122 of films that was calculated analytically near @xmath24 by albert schmid @xcite .",
    "in such infinitely extended films one has @xmath406 since all field lines have to pass the film .",
    "therefore , the magnetization @xmath436 of the film can not be calculated as a difference of fields , but one has to take the derivative of the total free energy , @xmath437 .",
    "a more elegant method calculates @xmath436 by doria s virial theorem @xcite , which for bulk superconductors yields eq .",
    "indeed , it was shown recently @xcite that this virial idea can be generalized to films of arbitrary thickness and @xmath436 may be calculated directly from the gl solution for the film , with no need to take an energy derivative .",
    "the resulting magnetization of the film is plotted versus the applied field in fig .  12 for various film thicknesses @xmath397 and various gl parameters @xmath1 .",
    "the curves for various @xmath397 cut each other at @xmath438 .",
    "for @xmath439 the thick film limit ( @xmath440 but still film width @xmath441 ) yields a straight line , @xmath442 .",
    "this result is valid for large demagnetization factor @xmath84 , @xmath443 ; it differs from the bulk result for @xmath436 shown in fig .  3 , which is valid for the demagnetization - free limit of @xmath444 .",
    "one may ask why the magnetization @xmath445 is not calculated via the general definition of the magnetic moment @xmath446 @xcite from the current density @xmath447 , which is easily calculated as a periodic function by our fourier method , both for bulk and film superconductors .",
    "however , into this definition enters not only the periodic part , i.e. , the vortex currents circulating inside each vortex cell ; this contribution even would give the wrong sign of @xmath448 . the main contribution to",
    "the magnetic moment of a superconductor of any shape comes from the screening currents that flow near the surface of the specimen .",
    "the magnetization in superconductors is thus not a volume property as it is in magnets .",
    "for example , for a long cylinder in parallel field @xmath7 the magnetization @xmath449 is composed of the positive contribution @xmath0 of the vortex currents and the negative ( and larger ) contribution @xmath7 of the surface currents that screen the cylinder from the applied field @xmath7 before vortices are allowed to penetrate . near @xmath24 , both terms nearly compensate and @xmath450 is a small difference of two big terms . in the film geometry , and for most other shapes of the superconductor ,",
    "the screening current is not easily known but has to be computed ; such computations for thin and thick strips , disks , and plates of macroscopic size @xmath451 are presented in @xcite .",
    "landau knew this problem , since he worked on demagnetization factors and on the intermediate state in type - i superconductors @xcite , and he used the thermodynamic definition of the magnetization as an energy derivative . in my view , the simple formula ( 55 ) derived by doria , gubernatis and rainer @xcite by scaling the coordinates in gl theory and finding a novel virial relationship between kinetic and potential energies from which the equilibrium field @xmath452 follows , was a fundamental discovery that occurred long after the publication of gl theory @xcite .                                        i.  l.  landau and h.  keller , phys .",
