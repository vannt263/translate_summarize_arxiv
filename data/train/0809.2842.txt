    "the equation of state ( eos ) is one of the most fundamental observables to identify different phases in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature @xmath1 . also , it is an essential input to describe the space - time evolution of the hot qcd matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "so far , the lattice qcd is the only systematic method to calculate eos for wide range of @xmath1 across the region of the hadron - quark phase transition ( see the recent review , @xcite ) .",
    "conventionally , the eos on the lattice is extracted from a method in which @xmath2 is varied by changing the lattice scale @xmath3 ( or equivalently the lattice gauge coupling @xmath4 ) with a fixed temporal lattice size @xmath0 . using the thermodynamic relation @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the spatial volume and @xmath7 being the partition function ,",
    "the pressure @xmath8 is calculated as @xcite @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the lattice action and @xmath11 is the thermal average with zero temperature contribution subtracted .",
    "( in multi - parameter cases such as qcd with dynamical quarks , `` @xmath12 '' should be generalized to the position vector in the coupling parameter space . )",
    "the initial point of integration @xmath13 is chosen in the low temperature phase from the condition @xmath14 .    in this conventional method , major part of the computational cost is devoted to zero temperature simulations ; they are necessary to set the lattice scale and to carry out zero - temperature subtractions at the simulation points .",
    "furthermore , for the calculation of the trace anomaly @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the energy density , the non - perturbative beta functions have to be determined by zero temperature simulations at the same simulation points . in multi - parameter cases",
    ", simulations should be performed on a line of constant physics ( lcp ) in the coupling parameter space in order to identify the effect of temperature to a given physical system .",
    "lcp s should be determined also at @xmath17 .",
    "these zero temperature simulations for a wide range of coupling parameters are numerically demanding , in particular , for qcd with dynamical quarks .    in this paper",
    ", we push an alternative approach where temperature is varied by @xmath0 with other parameters fixed . the fixed scale approach has been applied with the derivative method @xcite in , e.g. ref .",
    "however , determination of nonperturbative karsch coefficients for all the simulation points requires quite a work , which will not be easy for qcd with dynamical quarks . here",
    ", we propose a new method , `` the @xmath1-integral method '' : to calculate the pressure non - perturbatively , we use @xmath18 which is obtained from the thermodynamic relation valid at vanishing chemical potential : @xmath19 the initial temperature @xmath20 is chosen such that @xmath21 .",
    "calculation of @xmath22 requires the beta functions just at the simulation point , but no further karsch coefficients are necessary . since @xmath1 is restricted to have discrete values , we need to make an interpolation of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "since the coupling parameters are common to all temperatures , our fixed scale approach with the @xmath1-integral method has several advantages over the conventional approach ; ( i ) @xmath17 subtractions can be done by a common zero temperature simulation , ( ii ) the condition to follow the lcp is obviously satisfied , and ( iii ) the lattice scale as well as beta functions are required only at the simulation point . as a result of these ,",
    "the computational cost needed for @xmath17 simulations is reduced largely .",
    "we may even borrow results of existing high precision spectrum studies at @xmath17 which are public e.g.  on the international lattice data grid @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when the beta functions are not available , we need to perform additional @xmath17 simulations around the simulation points as in the case of the conventional method .    for a continuum extrapolation",
    ", we need to repeat the calculation at a couple of lattice spacings .",
    "if we adopt coupling parameters from @xmath17 spectrum studies in which the continuum extrapolation has already been performed , we can get all configurations for @xmath17 subtractions . furthermore , because the lattice spacings in spectrum studies are usually smaller than those used in conventional fixed-@xmath0 studies around the critical temperature @xmath24 , the values of @xmath0 in our approach are much larger there than those in conventional studies . for example ,",
    "at @xmath25 fm , @xmath26 mev is achieved by @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , for thermodynamic quantities around @xmath24 , we can largely reduce the lattice artifacts due to large @xmath3 and/or small @xmath0 over the conventional approach , without high computational cost for @xmath17 calculations .",
    "this is also a good news for phenomenological applications of the eos , since the temperature achieved in the relativistic heavy ion collision at rhic and lhc will be at most up to a few times the critical temperature @xcite . on the other hand , calculation of the trace anomaly around and below",
    "@xmath24 with large values of @xmath0 may require high statistics due to large cancellations by the @xmath17 subtraction .",

    "we estimate the statistical error for the @xmath1-integration by the jackknife analysis at each @xmath1 and accumulate the contributions from different @xmath1 s by the error propagation @xcite , because simulations at different @xmath0 are statistically independent .",

    "although a negative pressure is unphysical , because this shift in @xmath60 is smaller than the statistical errors , we disregard the effects of the negative pressure in this paper . to avoid arbitrary data handlings , we just adopt the results of natural cubic spline interpolations as the central values in the followings .    in fig .",

    "the normalized energy density @xmath65 is calculated by combining @xmath60 and @xmath51 .",
    "we find that , except for the vicinity of @xmath24 , the eos is rather insensitive to the variation of lattice size ( between @xmath66 fm and @xmath67 fm ) and the lattice spacing ( between @xmath68 fm and 0.063 fm ) .",
    "the results of eos agree within 10% for our variation of lattice parameters .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that @xmath51 is not so sensitive to the lattice parameters up to high temperatures .",
    "note also that , because @xmath69 in the high temperature limit , the increasingly large lattice artifacts at large @xmath1 are naturally suppressed in the @xmath1-integration .",
    "looking at the @xmath1  @xmath24 region closer , we note a slight tendency that both @xmath8 and @xmath16 decrease as the lattice size ( lattice spacing ) becomes larger ( smaller ) .    near and below @xmath24 , we observe a sizable finite size effect between @xmath66 fm ( i1 ) and @xmath67 fm ( i2 ) , while the effect of the lattice spacing is quite small ( i1 and i3 ) .",

    "we note that the height of the peak on the a2 lattice is similar to that of the fine i3 lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso1 ] and the fixed @xmath52 result . similar to the case of the isotropic lattice ,",
    "our result slightly overshoots the fixed @xmath0 result below @xmath24 and at @xmath86 mev . around the sharp lower edge at @xmath87 mev",
    ", the undershooting of the natural cubic spline interpolation on the i2 lattice , discussed in the previous section , is avoided by the finer data points on the a2 lattice .",
    "the results of pressure on the a2 and i2 lattices are compared in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2 ] . while they are roughly consistent with each other , we find that the pressure on the anisotropic lattice is slightly smaller than that on the isotropic lattice .",
    "this is in part due to the smaller values of @xmath15 around the peak at @xmath88 mev .",
    "we also note a slight tendency that the trace anomaly on the a2 lattice is systematically lower than that on the i2 lattice by about @xmath89 in the high temperature side .",
    "when we consider the difference between the a2 and i2 lattices as the systematic error due to the cruder @xmath1-resolution of the i2 lattice , the systematic error is about 2 - 3 times larger than the estimation in the previous section from a comparison of different interpolation anstze . therefore , for an estimation of the systematic error on isotropic lattices , it may be safer to assume a few times larger errors than those estimated from a comparison of different interpolation anstze .",
    "some part of this difference in the eos between a2 and i2 lattices might be explained by the difference of the lattice spacing in the temporal direction , since lattice artifacts of thermodynamic quantities generally have dominant contributions from the temporal lattice spacing @xcite . indeed this interpretation is supplemented by the fact that the difference in the eos between i1 and i3 has a similar tendency as shown in fig.[fig : iso2 ] .",
    "we reserve further investigation of this possibility for future study .",
    "we proposed a fixed scale approach to investigate finite temperature qcd on the lattice . to calculate eos non - perturbatively at fixed scale",

    ", we can largely reduce the lattice artifacts than the fixed @xmath0 approach .",
    "on the other hand , our approach is not suitable for studying the approach to the high @xmath1 limit because of small @xmath0 there .",
    "also , around and below @xmath24 , the large values of @xmath0 may require high statistics due to large cancellations by the @xmath17 subtraction . to test the @xmath1-integral method",
    ", we performed a series of simulations of su(3 ) gauge theory on isotropic and anisotropic lattices .",
    "we found that the method works quite well .",
    "our results of eos for the quenched qcd on isotropic and anisotropic lattices are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso2 ] , which are qualitatively consistent with the previous results using the conventional fixed @xmath0 approach .",
    "our eos in the high temperature region turned out to be roughly independent of the lattice spacing , lattice volume , and the anisotropy .",
    "all the results agree within about 10% for the range of our lattice parameters . with small statistical errors of less than about 2% , we identified small systematic shifts under the variations of lattice parameters .",
    "the smallness of them will be useful for precise continuum extrapolations . around the critical temperature",
    ", we found that the lattice size should be at least larger than about 2 fm .    the fixed scale approach with the @xmath1-integral method is applicable to qcd with dynamical quarks too .",
    "with dynamical quarks , it is more convenient to simulate isotropic lattices , because the tuning of anisotropy parameters as well as the determination of the factors @xmath90 in ( [ eq:7 ] ) requires quite a few works for full qcd .",
    "therefore , it is important to estimate the systematic error in eos due to the limited resolution of @xmath1 on an isotropic lattice . from the test of quenched qcd presented in this paper , we found that this systematic error is under control and its order of magnitude can be correctly estimated by a comparison of different interpolation anstze , though it may be safer to introduce a factor of about 2 - 3 to the estimates .",
    "we are currently investigating eos in @xmath91 flavor qcd with non - perturbatively improved wilson quarks , using the configurations by the cp - pacs / jlqcd collaboration @xcite , which are public on the ildg @xcite . the pseudo - critical temperature ( @xmath92 mev )",
    "is around @xmath93 on the finest lattice with @xmath25 fm .",
