    "the metal - insulator phase transition associated with charge and orbital ordering has been one of the central issues in physics of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "recently , isobe _",
    "et al._@xcite reported that the metal - insulator transition occurs in hollandite vanadate k@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 at @xmath8160 k , which is accompanied by a rapid reduction of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "a characteristic superlattice of @xmath9 is observed below the transition temperature .",
    "a possible charge - ordering phase transition accompanied by the spin - singlet formation has thereby been suggested.@xcite quite recently , the phase diagram under high pressures has also been obtained,@xcite where a variety of charge - ordered phases have been suggested to appear .",
    "the metal - insulator transition has also been observed in bi@xmath10v@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite and k@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite    the crystal structure of k@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 belongs to a group of hollandite - type phases and has a v@xmath11o@xmath2 framework composed of double strings of edge - shared vo@xmath12 octahedra .",
    "the system may be regarded as a one - dimensional version of livo@xmath0 known as a possible orbital - ordering system of the @xmath3 orbitals on the triangular lattice of @xmath13 spins.@xcite the present system k@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 has the average valence of v@xmath14 and thus is in the mixed valent state of v@xmath15 :  v@xmath16 .",
    "thus , the central issue in the present system is the mechanism of the metal - insulator transition concerning how the highly frustrated spin , charge , and orbital degrees of freedom at high temperatures are relaxed by lowering temperatures and what type of order is realized in the ground state .    in our previous paper,@xcite",
    "we studied this material in the strong correlation limit ; we set up a high - energy model hamiltonian and applied a strong - coupling perturbation theory to obtain the low - energy effective spin - orbit hamiltonian .",
    "the obtained effective hamiltonian was analyzed numerically and the possible orbital and spin structure of the ground state of the system was proposed.@xcite    however , so far not much is known even for the basic electronic states of the system , such as the band dispersion , fermi surface , density of states , etc .",
    ", both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is therefore to present an _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculation of this system to clarify its basic electronic structure . here",
    ", we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the electron correlations in the density functional theory .",
    "the study is thus in the weak correlation limit but we hope that one can learn much of the basic electronic states of this material .    in this paper , we will show the following : the electronic states near the fermi level are dominated by the three @xmath3-orbital components , where the hybridization with the oxygen @xmath4 orbitals is small .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are exactly degenerate and are lifted from the @xmath7 orbital ( hereafter we use the notation of the axes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 defined in ref . ,  @xcite also see fig .  5 below ) .",
    "the calculated band structure and fermi surface indicate that the system is not purely one - dimensional but the coupling between the vo double chains is important .",
    "we find no nesting features in the fermi surfaces that contribute to the instability of the doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath20 axis , suggesting the observed lattice instability to be the strong - coupling origin .",
    "we will compare our calculated results with experiment such as photoemission spectroscopy@xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr),@xcite from which we will discuss the implications on the electronic states and peculiarity of this material .    we hope that the present study , if combined with the strong - coupling approach , will give a reliable theory to explain the mechanism of the electronic phase transition of this intriguing material .",
    "we here employ the computer code wien2k@xcite based on the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method . we have tested both the local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation potential@xcite in the density functional theory . in this paper",
    ", we will however present only the results of gga because no significant differences are found between the results of lda and gga .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is not taken into account .",
    "no spin - polarization is assumed . in the self - consistent calculations , we use 4,335 @xmath21 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone ( see fig .",
    "1 ) with an anisotropic sampling in order to achieve better convergence . we use the plane - wave cutoff of @xmath22 bohr@xmath23 .",
    "we assume the experimental crystal structure of k@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 observed at room temperature ( above the metal - insulator transition ) with the lattice constants of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .@xcite the bravais lattice is body - centered tetragonal ( see fig .  1 ) and",
    "the primitive unit cell contains four v ions , one k ion , and eight o ions .",
    "we use the code xcrysden@xcite for graphical purposes .",
    "the calculated band dispersion near the fermi energy is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we find that there are 12 @xmath3 bands of the v @xmath26 orbitals , 5 of which cross the fermi level .",
    "we find the highly dispersive bands along the @xmath27-k@xmath28 , x - p , and m - k@xmath0 lines and weakly dispersive bands along the @xmath27-x , p - k@xmath28 , and k@xmath28-k@xmath0 lines , reflecting the one - dimensionality of the electronic state .",
    "however , the band structure is not simple even near the fermi energy , suggesting that the contributions from the three - dimensionality are not negligible ; in particular , the relatively large dispersion along the @xmath27-m line reflects the coupling between the vo double chains .",
    "thus , to consider the low - energy electronic properties of this system , the three - dimensionality or the coupling between the vo double chains is essential .",
    "this result is consistent with the observed rather small anisotropy of the electric resistivity of the single crystal of this material.@xcite     +      the calculated density of states is shown in fig .  3 , both in a wide energy range in ( a ) and near the fermi energy in ( b ) .",
    "we find that the v @xmath26 band is located between @xmath29 ev and @xmath30 ev and is well separated from the o @xmath4 band located between @xmath31 ev and @xmath32 ev . the hybridization between v @xmath26 and o @xmath4 orbitals seems to be rather small , justifying the use of the strong - coupling model with only the @xmath33 orbitals.@xcite we also find that the @xmath3 band is well separated from the @xmath34 band in the v @xmath26 bands , corresponding to a large value of the crystal field splitting of @xmath35 ev .",
    "thus , the low - energy properties of this system is essentially governed by the three @xmath3 orbitals , @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the calculated orbital - decomposed partial densities of states @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are shown in fig .",
    "we first find that the total density of states at the fermi level is very high , @xmath38 states / f.u./ev ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , which comes mainly from the three @xmath3 orbitals ; the large ferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed in the nmr experiment@xcite may be related to this high density of states at the fermi level .",
    "we then find that the three @xmath3 orbitals equally contribute to the low - energy states near the fermi energy .",
    "more precisely , we note that , even in the presence of the distortions of the vo@xmath12 octahedra , the relation @xmath39 strictly holds .",
    "this is due to the inversion symmetry along the @xmath20-axis preserved even in the presence of the distortion.@xcite we find that the width of the @xmath7 band is slightly smaller than the width of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "we also find that the number of electrons in the @xmath7 orbital is slightly larger than that in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals ; in the v atomic sphere , they are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , in the energy range of the @xmath3 bands ( see sec .",
    "iii d ) .",
    "+   +      the calculated results for the fermi surface are shown in fig .",
    "there are 12 @xmath3 bands , 5 of which cross the fermi level and form the fermi surface . if the system were strictly one - dimensional , a pair of the parallel fermi surfaces should appear at @xmath42 .",
    "we actually find such types of the pairs of the fermi surfaces in figs .  4 ( c ) and ( d ) , but the surfaces are rather distorted and moreover there are other types of the fermi surfaces present . in particular , the fermi surface shown in fig .",
    "4(e ) comes from the dispersive band along the @xmath27-m line of the brillouin zone ( see fig .  2 ) and is related to the coupling between the vo double chains .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the system is not purely one - dimensional , but the three - dimensionality or the coupling between the vo double chains is important .",
    "we should point out that the possible nesting features in the two nearly - parallel fermi surfaces seen in fig .",
    "4(c ) does not lead to the @xmath43 instability corresponding to the observed@xcite doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath20 axis expected in the weak - coupling theory because the distance between the two fermi surfaces is too short .",
    "no other fermi surfaces are seen to contribute to the instability of the @xmath44 superlattice formation .",
    "we therefore consider the observed lattice instability to be the strong - coupling origin , such as the long - range coulomb interactions leading to charge orderings.@xcite     +      the spatial distribution of the valence electrons of k@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 in the energy range between @xmath29 ev and the fermi level is shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath3 electrons mainly contribute to this distribution .",
    "we find that the result can be understood if we assume that the valence electrons are confined predominantly in the ligand field of each vo@xmath12 octahedron ; i.e. , the distribution can be projected mainly onto the @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 orbitals . more precisely , however , we find that the distribution is somewhat compressed in the @xmath19 direction ( toward the apical o ) and spread in the @xmath45 plane , indicating that the number of @xmath7 electrons is larger than that of @xmath5 and @xmath6 electrons .",
    "this is consistent with the results for the orbital - decomposed partial density of states ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , where the area below the fermi level in the @xmath7 component is slightly larger than that in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components .",
    "we also note that the electron distribution reflects the symmetry that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are equivalent . in the atomic limit , this degeneracy corresponds to the fact that the atomic energy levels of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are exactly degenerate in the ionic model and are located slightly lower in energy than the atomic level of the @xmath7 orbital.@xcite the orbital ordering in this system has thereby been suggested in the strong coupling theory.@xcite     +",
    "our calculated results presented here contains series of theoretical predictions , which should be checked by the experimental studies .",
    "let us first compare our calculated results with the results of the photoemission spectroscopy experiment.@xcite it has been reported that , above the transition temperature , the coherent quasiparticle peak appears at the binding energy of @xmath46 ev ( where the fermi energy is set to 0 ) , which we find corresponds well to the @xmath3 band below the fermi energy shown in fig .  3 .",
    "the large incoherent spectral weight also appears at the binding energy of @xmath47 ev where a large gap with vanishing density of states appears in our calculated results ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this result suggests the importance of electron correlations in this material ; as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the situation is similar to the case of v@xmath0o@xmath48 , for which the single - particle excitation spectra have been studied in detail.@xcite the large and broad spectral weight appears at @xmath49 ev , which comes mainly from the o 2@xmath50 orbitals .",
    "the position and shape of this spectral weight agree well with our calculated density of states shown in fig .",
    "3 .    below the transition temperature , the coherent peak near the fermi energy has been reported to shift largely to higher binding energies , reflecting the opening of the quasiparticle gap of 230 mev.@xcite the reconstruction of the electronic states by the metal - insulator transition should be pursued theoretically . however , the lda and gga calculations can not reproduce the charge - ordered states with the spin - singlet formation .",
    "one needs to invent the strongly - correlated electron models to account for the phase transition , of which the simplest one - dimensional version has been proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "further study is required to take into account of the three - dimensionality of the system .",
    "it has been reported in a recent nmr experiment@xcite that there appears an exceptionally strong temperature dependence of the rotation of the nmr knight - shift tensor , which suggests the strong orbital dependence of the local spin susceptibility .",
    "the degeneracy of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals may play a role here .",
    "we point out that the essential information should be obtained if the calculation of the spin density distribution under a uniform magnetic field can be made , which we leave for our future study .",
    "it has also been reported@xcite that , under high pressures , a variety of charge - ordered phases appear in this system ; in particular , a different charge - ordered pattern with the antiferromagnetic long - range order has been suggested to occur above @xmath81 gpa at low temperatures .",
    "competing phases with similar energies have therefore been suggested to exist in this system , which should further be clarified both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "we have carried out the _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculation of hollandite vanadate k@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 to clarify its basic electronic states in the weak correlation limit .",
    "we have shown the following :    \\(i ) the states near the fermi level consist predominantly of the three @xmath3 orbitals and the hybridization with the oxygen @xmath4 orbitals is small . the strong - coupling model based on the three @xmath3 orbitals",
    "may therefore be justified .",
    "\\(ii ) the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are exactly degenerate and are lifted from the @xmath7 orbital .",
    "the doubly - degenerate atomic energy levels may play a role in the observed electronic properties of the system .",
    "\\(iv ) no nesting features in the fermi surfaces that contribute to the instability of the doubling of the unit cell along the @xmath20 axis are seen , suggesting the observed lattice instability to be the strong - coupling origin .",
    "we hope that the present results obtained in the weak correlation limit will be combined with the theory based on the strongly - correlated electron models in near future , to help us understand the nature of the charge , orbital , and spin degrees of freedom of this intriguing material .",
