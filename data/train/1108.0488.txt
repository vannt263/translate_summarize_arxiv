    "controllability and observability are fundamental properties of a linear system ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with extending these notions to the case of uncertain linear systems with the aim of gaining greater understanding of the structure of uncertain linear systems when applied to problems of reduced order modelling and minimal realization .",
    "one reason for considering the issue of controllability for uncertain systems might be to determine if a robust state feedback controller can be constructed for the system ; e.g. , see @xcite . in this case",

    ", one would be interested in the question of whether the system is `` observable '' for all possible values of the uncertainty ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "however , these questions of robust controllability and robust observability are not the questions being addressed in this paper .    for the case of linear systems , the notions of controllability and observability",
    "are central to realization theory ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "for example , it is known that if a linear system contains unobservable or uncontrollable states , those states can be removed in order to obtain a reduced dimension realization of the system s transfer function . from this point of view , a natural extension of the notion of controllability to the case of uncertain systems , would be to consider `` possibly controllable '' states which are controllable for some possible values of the uncertainty .",
    "this idea was developed in the paper @xcite for the case of uncertain linear systems with structured uncertainty subject to averaged integral quadratic constraints ( iqcs ) .",
    "similarly , a natural extension of the notion of observability to uncertain systems is to consider robustly unobservable states which are `` unobservable '' for all possible values of the uncertainty .",
    "this idea was developed in the papers @xcite .",
    "this paper builds on concepts of  robust unobservability and `` possible controllability '' developed in the papers @xcite .",
    "the results presented in the paper aim to provide insight into the structure of uncertain systems as it relates to questions of realization theory and reduced dimension modelling for uncertain systems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "we formally define notions of robust unobservability and possible controllability in terms of certain constrained optimization problems .",
    "the notion of robust unobservability used in this paper involves extending the standard linear systems definition of the observability gramian to the case of uncertain systems ; see also @xcite .",
    "also , the notion of possible controllability used in this paper involves extending the standard linear systems definition of the controllability gramian to the case of uncertain systems ; see also @xcite .",
    "we then apply the s - procedure ( e.g. , see @xcite ) to obtain conditions for robust unobservability and possible controllability in terms of unconstrained lq optimal control problems dependent on lagrange multiplier parameters as in @xcite . from this",
    ", we develop a geometric characterization for the set of robustly unobservable states ( as in @xcite ) and the set of possibly controllable states .",
    "these characterizations imply that the set of robustly unobservable states is in fact a linear subspace .",
    "similarly , we show that the set of possibly controllable states is a linear subspace ; see also @xcite .",
    "these characterizations lead to a kalman type decomposition for the uncertain systems under consideration ; see also @xcite , @xcite and theorem 4.3 in chapter 3 of @xcite .",
    "this decomposition is described in the four possible cases for which an uncertain system model can have robustly unobservable states or states which are not possibly controllable .",
    "these are the cases in which a reduced dimension uncertain system model can be obtained which retains the same set of input - output behaviours as the original model .",
    "as compared to the previous papers @xcite , the results of this paper enable a complete geometrical picture to be obtained which can be applied to problems of reduced dimension modelling of uncertain linear systems .",
    "also , the results of this paper are much more computationally tractable than the results of the papers @xcite . the main assumption required in this paper as compared to the previous papers @xcite is the assumption that the uncertainty is unstructured and described by a single averaged uncertainty constraint .    the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows . in section [ formulation ] , the class of uncertain systems under consideration is introduced and definitions of robust unobservability and possible controllability are given . in section [ existing ] , the existing geometrical results on robust observability are summarized . in sections",
