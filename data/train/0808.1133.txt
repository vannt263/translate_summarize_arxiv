    "this insight has proved useful both for unifying numerous previously known inequalities of this kind and for discovering new ones @xcite .",
    "related methods have also been used to obtain control on the spectrum of laplace and schrdinger operators in terms of curvature @xcite .",
    "many of the universal inequalities related to trace identities are sharp in the sense that they are saturated for particular examples : for the schrdinger operators treated in @xcite the upper bounds on eigenvalue gaps @xmath5 become identities for all @xmath6 in the case of the harmonic oscillator , while for laplacians on embedded manifolds discussed in @xcite all of the gap bounds become identities for embedded spheres .",
    "more recently , in some circumstances ( e.g. , @xcite ) universal bounds on moments of eigenvalues have been connected to `` semiclassical '' theorems about the spectrum such as asymptotic behavior as the index @xmath7 and nonasymptotic bounds in the spirit of the berezin - li - yau inequality @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations of this work is to sharpen the understanding of moments of eigenvalues and of riesz means of the spectrum , which plays something like the role of a dual version of moments . among the applications of our analysis",

    "these imply bounds on ratios of averages of eigenvalues .",
    "we also introduce a novel type of inequality relating arithmetic and geometric means of eigenvalues .",
    "a second motivation is to better unify the subject of universal bounds with formally analogous semiclassical spectral theorems .    in the next section we present some more abstract versions of the essential trace identity of @xcite for a class of self - adjoint operators @xmath8 enjoying algebraic properties modeled on those of of schrdinger operators .",
    "we also identify a special family of functions for which @xmath9 can be sharply controlled , _ viz . _ :    [ sj ] let @xmath8 be a self - adjoint operator and let @xmath10 be a distinguished subset of the spectrum .",
    "we let @xmath11 denote the smallest closed interval containing @xmath12 .",
