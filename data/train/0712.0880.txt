    "driven metal - insulator transition has been experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "however , in shallow wells , the quantum fluctuations are expected to be small , making gp equation useful for identifying ground state structures .    for discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation , smerzi _ et al . _ in 2002 @xcite , predicted a dynamical superfluid insulator transition ( dsit ) , which is different from the fluctuation driven quantum phase transition .",
    "modulational instability , occurring in the system , leads to the loss of phase coherence .",
    "hence , dsit takes place and the superfluid phase transits to the insulating state . followed by this prediction , cataliotti _ et al . _ in @xmath0 @xcite , reported the experimental observation of the destruction of interference pattern and loss of superfluidity through dsit . in the same year , adhikari demonstrated numerically the loss of phase coherence and superfluidity of bec @xcite with two - body interaction .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of a superfluid density wave state of bec in an optical lattice , in the presence of both cubic and quintic nonlinear interactions .",
    "this phase , with twice the periodicity of the lattice , ceases to exist , when only cubic and quintic nonlinearities are present .",
    "we have considered two - body interaction to be repulsive and quintic interaction to be attractive for physical realization .",
    "the existence of stripe phase is shown , where superfluid matter is found only in finite domains .",
    "we predict that dsit occurs in this system also , where all the atoms transit from the superfluid phase to an insulating phase , with analogous periodicity .",

    "it differs for odd and even lattice positions with respect to a given site , taking a constant value for even @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , for odd @xmath1 , it depends on the depth of the lattice potential , as well as the interaction strengths . in the presence of quintic nonlinearity alone",

    "the energy is continuous ; however , the first derivative at the transition point ( t ) , is discontinuous like the previous case , hence , indicating that the phase transition , is of first order .",

    "the interaction and potential strength , here , should have the same signature . for a positive @xmath69 ,",
    "these two phases respectively belong to attractive and repulsive regimes .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that for a fixed @xmath69 and coupling both these insulating phases only exist for a given number density of atoms . in this case , as well as in the previous cases ,",
    "interestingly we find that the dispersion affects the density marginally , where it adds a constant term in the phase .",
    "keeping in mind the possibilities of charge density type of ground states in one dimension , it is natural to investigate if other type of solutions , still commensurate with lattice periodicity , are allowed in this system .",
    "we have found such an exact solution exhibiting _ rational _ character : @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these solutions do not exist in superfluid phase .",
    "the parameters for this insulating phase are given by , @xmath73 with , @xmath74 . here , the competition of the lattice potential with the non - linearity is responsible for the non - perturbative rational solutions with dual frequency character , both commensurate with the lattice potential .",
    "it is worth observing that , in case of solitons , non - linearity and dispersion compensate each other , leading to stable localized solutions , as well as periodic non - sinusoidal cnoidal waves .",
    "presently , the dispersion affects the character of the solution marginally . for non - singular solutions , @xmath75 in repulsive interaction regime ( @xmath76 ) , and @xmath77 in attractive regime ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in contrast to the earlier found insulating phases , which are independent of the background , the present density wave solution has a background , which depends both on potential and the coupling .",
    "we further observe that , both the modulations are necessarily present in the presence of the lattice potential .    the energy function is non - analytic as @xmath79 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the pad type of solutions representing insulating phase reduces to the insulating phase exhibiting single frequency behaviour found earlier . in the limit @xmath81 ,",
    "the bec is pushed gradually to the unstable position on top of the hills of the lattice potential indicating the unphysical nature of this singular point .",
    "in the superfluid phase , the phase coherence between the different sites of the optical lattice in a bec has been established experimentally through the formation of the interference pattern between condensates located at the nodes of the laser standing wave . in the insulating phase ,",
    "the phase coherence is lost and hence , no interference pattern is formed .",
    "the phases identified here , can be detected in a method used by cataliotti _ et .",
    "al . _ , in @xcite for pure two - body interaction .",
    "the density wave insulating phase will not show phase coherence , however , unlike the regular insulating phase , the spatial distribution of atoms will show periodic behaviour commensurate with the lattice potential .",
    "the stripe phase will show phase coherence between the atoms , where the atoms will occupy only the alternating lattice sites .    to check the parameter regime for the possible existence of these type of density wave and stripe phase , we consider the @xmath82 condensate with @xmath83 number of atoms .",
    "mass of the atom is @xmath84 @xmath85 and the transverse trapping frequency is @xmath86 @xmath87 . the s - wave scattering length @xmath88 @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the two - body interaction strength is given by , @xmath90 .",
    "the wave vector @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all the above parameters can be changed independently .",
    "larger values of interaction strengths can be achieved by higher density of the condensate , higher @xmath46 and for small @xmath9 .",
    "the scattering length can be tuned as well by feshbach resonance .",
    "small @xmath9 may be achieved by adjusting the relative angle between the two interfering laser beams .",
    "the optical lattice depth is taken as @xmath93 ( in the units of @xmath7 ) , implying that the potential is shallow , where the mean field gp equation is valid .",
    "as we increase @xmath69 , at some point , phase coherence is lost and superfluidity breaks down and there will be no tunnelling of atoms between consecutive lattice sites .",
    "hence , the phenomena discussed in this paper should be observable within the present experimental capability .",
    "in summary , a superfluid density wave , having a periodicity twice that of the lattice potential , exists in the presence of both cubic and quintic nonlinear interactions , where the density modulation is over a constant background . a stripe phase is present in certain parameter regime , where superfluid matter is present in only some domains of the lattice .",
    "these phases are absent , when , only cubic and quintic nonlinear interactions are present .",
