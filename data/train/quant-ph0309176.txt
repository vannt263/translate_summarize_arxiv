    "<S> we present the case of quantal transmission through a smooth , single - piece exponential potential , @xmath0 , in contrast to the piece - wise continuous potentials , as a pedagogic model to demonstrate the analytic extraction of transmission ( reflection ) co - efficient .    </S>",
    "<S> = 100000    the schrdinger transmission through a one - dimensional potential well / barrier constitutes an essential topic in the courses and text - books [ 1,2 ] on quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the main interest is to find the probability of transmission , @xmath1 , and that of reflection , @xmath2 , when a particle is incident with an energy @xmath3 at the potential from one side . for a real potential </S>",
    "<S> these two probanilities are such that @xmath4 , ensuring the conservation of the incident flux of the particles . due to simplicity of treatment , usually a rectangilar well / barrier or a sharp step - potentials </S>",
    "<S> are included as examples . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials are both piece - wise constant and piece - wise continuous , the former is a three - piece and the latter is a two - piece function .    for the case of three - piece potentials : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where the schrdinger equation does not possess analytic form , the numerical computation of @xmath1 is performed by letting @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 [ 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote two linearly indedependent solutions of the schrdinger equation with initial values as @xmath12 , for numerical integration of the schrdinger from @xmath13 upto @xmath14 . here </S>",
    "<S> the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath15 . for the case of a rectangular well / barrier of depth / height , @xmath16 , </S>",
    "<S> these functions are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 . the     +    matching of the wavefunctions and their derivatives at @xmath14 , leads to the elimination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 and we can get the complex transmission amplitude as @xmath22 and complex reflection amplitude as @xmath23 the energy - dependent quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 are called reflection phase - shift and transmission phase - shift , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the energy derivative of the phase - shift is interpreted as the time spent by a particle in these processes [ 1,2 ] .    however , in practical situations the potentials are smooth ( continuous and diferentiable everywhere ) and single piece which may or may not vanish asymptotically . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials are the parabolic barrier [ 4 ] , the eckart barrier [ 3,4,5 ] , the fermi - step barrier[3,5 ] , the rosen - morse barrier [ 6 ] , the ginocchio barrier [ 7 ] , the scarf barrier [ 8 ] , the morse barrier [ 9 ] and a potential which interpolates between morse and eckart barriers [ 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission co - efficients for these models have been obtained analytically . in all such cases [ 3 - 10 ] , </S>",
    "<S> a single function is obtained as the solution of the schrdinger equation which behaves as a transmitted wave on one side of the potential at asymptotically large distances ( say , @xmath26 ) . on the other side of the potential </S>",
    "<S> the same wavefunction behaves asymptotically ( say , @xmath27 ) as a combination of oppositely travelling incident and reflected waves . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these asymptotic forms of the wavefunctions may or may not be plane - waves depending on whether the potential converges to zero or not at the asymptotic distance . </S>",
    "<S> this dual asymptotic behaviour of a single wave - solution on two sides of the potential barrier which is absent in the piece - wise constant / continuous potentials is worthwhile to demonstrate through a simple do - able example </S>",
    "<S> . it will be even more valuable if one can extract simple forms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 analytically .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a smooth single - piece potential ( see fig.1 ) : @xmath28 which vanishes asymptotically as @xmath27 but it diverges to @xmath29 as @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we feel that the attractive exponential potential ( 1 ) presents a simple instance containing the essential features of analytic extraction of transmission co - efficient for a one piece smooth potential .    in </S>",
    "<S> the following we proceed to find @xmath1 and discuss various aspects of schrdinger transmission arising thereby . </S>",
    "<S> the time - independent schrdinger equation with ( 1 ) is written as @xmath31\\psi(x)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the mass and energy of the incident particle and @xmath34 is the planck - constant . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent wave function is written as @xmath35 let us substitute @xmath36 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) and write @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the transformed equation is the standard cylindrical bessel equation [ 11 ] whose linearly independent solutions for any positive energy are the bessel functions : @xmath40 and @xmath41 or the henkel functions : @xmath42 and @xmath43 . noting the asymptotic property that @xmath44 as @xmath45 is large for large positive values of @xmath15 , we admit    @xmath46    @xmath47,~~\\mbox{when}~x\\rightarrow \\infty,\\ ] ]    @xmath48.\\ ] ]    this represents a wave which is exponentially decaying yet travelling towards @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of constancy of the phase i.e. , @xmath49 yields positive phase velocity : @xmath50 which is positive definite and does not change sign and hence the direction of the wave is unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> thus eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6a ) represents a transmitted wavefunction , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the other degenerate and linearly independent solution of the schrdinger equation ( 2 ) , @xmath43 has been dropped . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to note that a linear combination of these solutions can not produce the boundary condition of a transmitted wave , traveling towards @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we note valuable identities : @xmath52/\\sin(\\nu \\pi ) , \\mbox{and } h^{(2)}_\\nu(z)=i[j_{\\nu}(z)-e^{i \\pi \\nu}j_{-\\nu}(z)]/\\sin(\\nu \\pi).\\ ] ] we can also write eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6a ) as @xmath53 e^{-iet \\over \\hbar}.\\ ] ] the asymptotic behaviour of bessel function for small @xmath54-values is given by [ 11 ] @xmath55}.\\ ] ] consequently , we can write by combining eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) and ( 9 ) @xmath56 } e^{i(kx - et/\\hbar)}- { ( p/2)^{-iq } \\over \\sinh   q\\pi \\gamma[1-iq]}e^{-i(kx+e t/\\hbar)},~~ x \\rightarrow -\\infty.\\ ] ] when @xmath27 , @xmath54 tends to a very small value , for the result ( 9 ) to hold . </S>",
    "<S> the right side of the above equation represents a linear combination of two oppositely travelling plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - velocities of the first and second part are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the transmitted wave has been identified to have positive phase - velocity travelling from left to right so as to leave the barrier , the first part represents the incident wave , @xmath59 travelling from left to right impinging upon the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the second part represents a reflected wave , @xmath60 , travelling from right to left . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to note here that the asymptotic form of @xmath61 as @xmath27 is a linear combination of the plane - waves since the potential ( 1 ) actually vanishes at a large distance on the left side of the barrier ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the wave - function @xmath61 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) and ( 10 ) are nothing but exact and asymptotic forms of the sum of incident wave , @xmath59 , and reflected wave , @xmath60 , wavefunctions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> having found the incident , reflected and transmitted wavefunctions , we now find the flux , @xmath62 arising due to @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> yet another instructive point is in order here . </S>",
    "<S> the flux can also be written as a wronskian : @xmath64 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the linearly independent solution of ( 2 ) , the wronskian , @xmath67 $ ] , will be constant ( independent of @xmath15 ) of motion ( see e.g. , p. 48 in [ 2 ] ) . therefore , if the ( approximate ) asymptotic forms of @xmath68 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6b ) and ( 10 ) are used they will yield the same value of flux @xmath69 as the exact wavefunctions will do . </S>",
    "<S> one can check this point for the present problem by recalling the wronskians [ 11 ] ,    @xmath70=-{2\\sin\\nu \\pi \\over \\pi z},~ w[h^{(1)}_{\\nu}(z),h^{(2)}(z)_{\\nu}]=-{4i \\over \\pi z}~\\ ] ]    and @xmath71^\\ast=- e^{\\pi q } h^{(2)}_{iq } ( z).\\ ] ]    thus , the various fluxes work out to be @xmath72 in obtaining the above results we have used the formula : @xmath73 [ 11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the transmission and reflection co - efficients are found as @xmath74,~r(e)={{\\cal j}_r \\over { \\cal j}_i}=e^{-2\\pi q},~ q=\\sqrt { e\\over \\delta},~~\\delta={\\hbar^2 \\over 8ma^2}.\\ ] ] these co - efficients satisfy @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> let us find the special values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for consistency . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath75 ; @xmath76 which are physically feasible . interestingly </S>",
    "<S> , these co - efficients ( 14 ) do not depend up on the parameter , @xmath16 , and rightly so . since any finite positive value of @xmath16 is expressible as @xmath77 , and it would merely result in shifting the whole potential on the @xmath78axis by a distance @xmath79 : @xmath80 .    in mathematical terms , when @xmath81 , the classical limits are obtained as @xmath82 , and @xmath83 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , practically the classical limit is reached when an effective parameter , for example @xmath84 ( 14 ) , becomes extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn is materialized when the tunneling system becomes massive or / and a length scale found in the interaction ( e.g. , @xmath85 here ) becomes extremely large . in the cases [ 3 - 10 ] , where a potential offers a barrier of a height , @xmath16 , the classical limit of @xmath1 is a step function of energy : @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> since the exponential potential ( 1 ) does not offer any barrier to an incident particle in a classical sense , we have got @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us divide eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) and ( 6b ) by the co - efficent of @xmath87 in ( 10 ) to re - write @xmath61 respectively as    @xmath88 \\over \\gamma[1-iq]}\\right ) e^{-i(kx+e t/\\hbar ) } , ~~ x \\rightarrow -\\infty,\\ ] ]    @xmath89 e^{-q\\pi/2 } \\right ) e^{-{x \\over 4a } } \\exp [ i(pe ^{x \\over 2a}-e t/\\hbar)],~~\\mbox{when}~x\\rightarrow \\infty.\\ ] ]    the multiplicative factor of @xmath90 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15a ) is called as reflection amplitude , @xmath91 and the factor written in big brackets in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15b ) is called transmission amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath92 generally , @xmath93 , however , @xmath94 holds only if the potential converges to the same asymptotic value on both the sides of the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> since here it is not the case ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , the expression of @xmath1 as obtained in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) by using the ratio of transmitted to incident flux , is more fundamental and one finds that @xmath95 is proportional to ( if not identical ) to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> let us define arg@xmath96=\\alpha$ ] and arg@xmath97=\\beta$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> for the exponential potential barrier , we get @xmath98    when a particle is transmitted through a potential from one side to the other , it sees the total potential in every detail . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , detailed balancing takes place to give rise to reciprocity of transmission : it does not matter if the particle is incident from left of right the transmission amplitude remains the same ( invariant ) , i.e. , @xmath99.$ ] this implies the invariance of both transmission probability i.e. , @xmath100 and transmission phase - shift i.e. , @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> further , due to the conservation of flux invariance of reflection probability also takes place , namely , @xmath102    the behaviour of @xmath103 with respect to the side of the incidence the particle is known ( p. 109 </S>",
    "<S> [ 1 ] ) as . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath104 = ( 2n+1)\\pi-[\\phi_{right}(e)-\\theta_{right}(e)],~n=0,1,2, ... \\ ] ] interestingly , it turns out that if the potential is real and symmetric , we have @xmath105 [ 12 ] , and hence @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the present potential being non - symmetric provides an opportunity for a simple pedagogic demonstration of the result in eq . ( </S>",
    "<S> 18 ) and the invariance of @xmath107 and @xmath2 with respect to the side from which the particle is incident on the potential .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to repeat the calculations when the side of the incidence has been changed from left to right ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . using the standard relations ( 7 ) </S>",
    "<S> : we find that @xmath108 this identity suggests that    @xmath109    which in turn has an analytic behaviour for @xmath110 , @xmath111 } e^{-i(kx+et/\\hbar)}.\\ ] ]    this represents a wave travelling to the left after being transmitted from the potential ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . using eq.(9 ) and the asymptotic properties of @xmath112 as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) , we find that @xmath113 in the asymptotic form of the wave function ( 21 ) , the first part denotes the incident wave , @xmath59 , entering from the right side of the potential ( see fig.1(b ) ) and travelling to the left . </S>",
    "<S> the second part denotes oppositely travelling reflected wave , @xmath60 . the transmitted wave , @xmath51 , is represented by eq.(19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can recover , the results found in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 14 ) by evaluating the flux arising due to these wave - forms when the side of incidence has been changed . </S>",
    "<S> the recovery of @xmath1 and @xmath2 despite the change of the side of the incidence of the particle on the potential ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) demonstrates their invariance with respect to the side of incidence of the particle whether it is left or right .    </S>",
    "<S> once again , let us divide eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 19b ) and ( 20 ) by the co - efficient written outside the big bracket in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 20 ) to get    @xmath114 } e^{-i(kx+et/\\hbar ) } , ~~ \\mbox { when}~~x\\rightarrow -\\infty,\\ ] ]    @xmath115    the amplitudes can be extracted as earlier : @xmath116}.\\ ] ] further , we find the phase - shifts as @xmath117 to compare with phase - shifts given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 17 ) , and this completes the demonstration of the general results given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 18 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is further relevant to know that when the potential is complex , the reciprocity of the transmission amplitude with respect to the side of the incident particle still holds . </S>",
    "<S> however , reflection and absorption amplitudes and co - efficients depend on the side ( left / right ) of incident particle , if only , the total complex potential is non - symmetric , namely @xmath118 [ 13 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the utility of the schrdinger transmission in many physical processes can be appreciated as follows . </S>",
    "<S> look at one body , @xmath119 , at rest in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and let other body , @xmath120 , come from a side with an energy , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> assume that the interactions between @xmath119 and @xmath120 are of two types : short - ranged and long - ranged . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interaction barrier ( e.g. eq.1(b ) ) due to long - ranged interaction has to be overcome by the body @xmath120 in order to appear on the other side to have any worthwhile contact / reaction with @xmath119 , characterized by their short - ranged interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of the appearance of the body , @xmath120 , on the other side is clearly proportional to the probability of transmission through the potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the reaction rates of @xmath119 and @xmath120 , would depend on the transmission probability , @xmath1 , apart from other factors .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , barrier penetration method of determining the fusion rates ( see [ 10 ] and refs . therein ) of nuclei is one such instance where fusion rates are determined by finding the penetrability @xmath121 of the inter - nuclear potential barrier formed due to short - ranged nuclear attraction and coulomb plus centrifugal repulsion .    in other kind of instances , a bound system ( e.g. @xmath122-particles in a nucleus [ 14 ] or electrons of a metal in the field emission [ 15 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> faces a barrier and the emission rates are then determined by the transmission co - efficient of the barrier .    </S>",
    "<S> the analytically solvable , smooth and single - piece potential barriers mentioned in the introduction find applications in several physical processes . </S>",
    "<S> the extraction of transmission co - efficient for these barriers involves higher order functions . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> the exponential barrier ( 1 ) presented here , despite being simple allows one to have the actual experience of extracting transmission ( reflection ) amplitude / co - efficent from a smooth , single - piece potential analytically . </S>",
    "<S> this problem may be practised right after doing rectangular well / barrier and before attempting the `` higher - order '' problems found in refs . </S>",
    "<S> [ 3 - 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential potential model also illustrates , with simplicity , several other aspects of schrdinger transmission from one - dimensional , real potentials . </S>"
