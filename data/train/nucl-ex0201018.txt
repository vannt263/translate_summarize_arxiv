    "<S> it is observed that @xmath0 in a+a and possibly p+p and @xmath1+p collisions follows interesting systematics in @xmath2 , the pion transverse energy per unit of rapidity and transverse overlap area . </S>",
    "<S> the systematics show a linear increase of @xmath0 with @xmath2 in the ags and sps energy regime and a saturation at rhic energy . </S>",
    "<S> the systematics indicate that @xmath2 might be the relevant variable underlying @xmath0 . at high energy , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 variable is related to the gluon saturation scale in high density qcd , and perhaps to the initial energy density in the bjorken picture .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd predicts that at sufficiently high energy density matter should be in a state of deconfined quarks and gluons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested long ago  @xcite that strangeness production is a sensitive probe to such a deconfined state . </S>",
    "<S> one of the common observables to search for strangeness enhancement is the @xmath3 ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> strangeness production and @xmath4 have been intensively studied in heavy - ion collisions at the ags  @xcite , sps  @xcite , and rhic  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ kpi_roots ] compiles @xmath4 in central heavy - ion ( a+a ) collisions  @xcite as a function of the collision energy , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 steadily increases with @xmath5 , while @xmath6 sharply increases at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of the rhic @xmath6 measurement clearly demonstrates that @xmath6 drops at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum @xmath6 value is reached at about @xmath7  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior of @xmath6 lies in the net - baryon density which changes significantly with @xmath5 , as noted previously  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to consider the two possible kaon production mechanisms : pair production of @xmath8 and @xmath9 which is sensitive to @xmath5 , and associated production of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) with a hyperon ( antihyperon ) which is sensitive to the net - baryon density . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a maximum in @xmath6 results from a dropping net - baryon density with energy and an increasing production rate . for comparison , fig .  [ kpi_roots ] also shows data from p+p  @xcite and @xmath1+p  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> enhancement in @xmath0 from elementary p+p to a+a collisions is about a factor of 2 and is similar at the sps and rhic , while that in @xmath6 is larger at lower energies due to the large net - baryon density in a+a . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath6 is complicated by the net - baryon density , the rest of the paper will focus on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> experiments at the ags and sps have studied the centrality dependence of kaon production in a+a . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ kmpi_npart ] shows @xmath0 as a function of the number of participants , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 increases with @xmath10 within the same collision system , however , differs in different systems at the same value of @xmath10 , indicating that @xmath10 is not an appropriate variable to describe @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been noted and emphasized before  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated thus far , @xmath0 depends on both the collision energy and centrality . to identify </S>",
    "<S> the possible underlying physics is the goal of the present study . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we first note that strangeness production may be enhanced due to the fast and energetically favorable process of gluon - gluon fusion into strange quark - antiquark pairs , and therefore may be sensitive to the initial gluon density . at high energies , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of mid - rapidity hadrons are products of gluons of transverse momentum @xmath11@xmath121  </S>",
    "<S> gev/@xmath13 in a pseudo - rapidity range @xmath14@xmath121  @xcite ( i.e. @xmath15 ) . from heisenberg uncertainty principle </S>",
    "<S> , these gluons occupy a longitudinal size of @xmath16  fm , which is larger than the lorentz contracted nucleus size at rhic energy . </S>",
    "<S> each gluon therefore sees all the nucleons in the longitudinal direction ( they overlap longitudinally ) ; the relevant quantity should be the gluon transverse area density  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the gluon density , @xmath17 , at bjorken @xmath18 is large such that gluons overlap in a volume of the gluon transverse size , @xmath19 , the gluons will recombine populating the large @xmath11 region , resulting in a saturation of gluon density with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation scale @xmath21 , based on the above uncertainty principle argument , is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the transverse overlap area of the colliding nuclei . that derived from qcd  @xcite is @xmath24 , where the number of colors @xmath25=3 , the strong coupling constant @xmath26@xmath120.6 , and @xmath27 is the participant density in the transverse plane . at rhic energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 is on the order of 12  gev/@xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that particle production at rhic ( and perhaps at sps ) is dominated by the gluon saturation region  @xcite . while number of constituents is not conserved during the hadronization process , the total transverse energy of gluons ( @xmath28 ) may be better preserved in the final hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the gluon saturation picture , we introduce a new , experimental variable : @xmath29^{1/3 } \\ ; . \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] since pion multiplicity is approximately proportional to the overlap volume ( or @xmath10 ) , and since @xmath30 is approximately constant over the measured centralities , @xmath2 is an approximate measure of the pion transverse energy per unit of rapidity and transverse overlap area : @xmath31 here @xmath30 and @xmath32 are the mid - rapidity pion mean transverse mass and multiplicity density , respectively , and the subscript ` cent ' stands for the most central collisions ; @xmath33 is the transverse radial size of nuclear overlap , and @xmath34=@xmath35 is that for the most central collisions . the first factor on the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w ] ) quantifies transverse energy production ; the second factor depends on the collision energy : the larger the energy , the smaller the @xmath36 probed by mid - rapidity hadrons , and the larger the gluon density ; the third factor defines centrality : the more nucleons in the longitudinal direction , the larger the gluon density in the transverse plane . </S>",
    "<S> the second and third factors combined , as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w_approx ] ) , scales with the transverse area gluon density . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 variable therefore unifies all three effects and is of use in studying systematics in heavy ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ kmpi_w ] shows the mid - rapidity @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite including different collision systems , energies , and centralities . </S>",
    "<S> the data seem to follow a trend : a linear increase of @xmath0 with @xmath2 in the ags and sps energy regime and a saturation at rhic with further increase in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed trend could imply that @xmath2 may be the relevant variable underlying @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting study in terms of the participant density @xmath27 can be found in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to emphasize that the @xmath2 defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w ] ) is an experimental variable . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation , however , needs a leap of faith . in the gluon saturation picture , it is possible that the initial gluon density is saturated at the sps and rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> as the saturation scale @xmath37 becomes large , the difference between kaon and pion masses becomes less important , resulting in a roughly constant @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> gluon saturation should be irrelevant at ags energies , as gluons can be distinguished longitudinally and quark contribution to particle production is significant . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that si+al and au+au data are on top of each other in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ kmpi_w ] indicates that @xmath2 may be the relevant quantity for @xmath0 at the ags , although the interpretation may be different from that at high energies .    a quick examination of eq .  ( [ eq : w_approx ] ) </S>",
    "<S> reveals that @xmath2 is approximately equal to the bjorken estimate  @xcite of the initial energy density ( @xmath38 ) times the formation time ( @xmath39 ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath39 as constant , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ kmpi_w ] implies that @xmath0 , while is increasing with @xmath38 at the sps , becomes insensitive to @xmath38 when @xmath38 becomes large at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation is that the chemical freeze - out condition ( which fixes @xmath0 ) is sensitive to @xmath38 at sps , while at rhic @xmath38 is no longer relevant to the ( later ) chemical freeze - out condition . </S>",
    "<S> we note , as @xmath39 likely decreases with the collision energy and some of the transverse energy is carried by particles other than pions , the above line of argument is at best qualitative .    </S>",
    "<S> strangeness enhancement is often referred to as an enhancement in @xmath4 in a+a with respect to minimum bias p+p at the same energy ( e.g. as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ kpi_roots ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this may not be justified as energy is not the only relevant variable . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is indeed the relevant variable , then a+a should have a larger @xmath2 value than the same energy p+p due to the @xmath40 factor . to calculate @xmath2 for p+p and @xmath1+p by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w_approx ] ) , we use @xmath41  fm , the proton size from the mit bag model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ kmpi_w ] shows in filled points @xmath0 in minimum bias p+p and @xmath1+p as a function of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the p+p and @xmath1+p data are , surprisingly , not far away from the systematics observed in a+a . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the @xmath33 value used is rather model dependent ; a choice of @xmath33=0.60.7  fm would bring the p+p and @xmath1+p data points on top of a+a .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> an interesting observation is made for the mid - rapidity @xmath0 ratio in heavy - ion collisions as a function of the experimental @xmath2 variable , the pion transverse energy per unit of rapidity and transverse overlap area , as defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w ] ) . at high collision energies </S>",
    "<S> , the variable may be related to the gluon saturation scale in high density qcd , and/or the bjorken estimate of initial energy density times formation time . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that @xmath0 increases linearly with @xmath2 in heavy - ion collisions at low energies and saturates at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> whether or not the elementary p+p and @xmath1+p data follow the same systematics depends on the choice of the proton size which is less certain than the transverse size of a heavy - ion collision . </S>",
    "<S> to further establish the observed systematics , low energy rhic data , overlapping with the existing sps and rhic data in @xmath2 , are essential . </S>"
