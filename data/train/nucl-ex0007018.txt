    "in the last decade a copious set of data on the close - to - threshold production of mesons @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 in the collisions of protons has been collected at the high precision accelerators in bloomington , uppsala , saclay and jlich .",
    "the quality of the determined energy dependence of the total cross sections for the @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath7  @xcite , and @xmath8  @xcite reactions enables investigations of the microscopic description of the primary production mechanism  @xcite and the interaction of protons with the created meson  @xcite . here a special emphasis is given to the still unknown interaction of protons with the @xmath1 meson , which can not be studied directly in the elastic @xmath1-proton scattering , due to the short life time of this meson .",
    "this issue will be discussed in the next section where the qualitative phenomenological analysis will be presented which results in the rough estimation of an upper limit for the proton-@xmath1 scattering length . in the third section",
    "preliminary results concerning the studies of the open strangeness production via the @xmath9 reaction close to the production threshold will be overviewed .    since the subject of this report covers only a part of the cosy  ",
    "11 activity the interested reader is encouraged for further reading of an unexpected large difference , observed recently , in the close - to - threshold @xmath10 meson production depending whether it is associated with a  @xmath11 or a  @xmath12 hyperon  @xcite .",
    "trying to compare the total cross section for the close - to - threshold production of different mesons one has to find an appropriate kinematical variable . usually , the total cross section is presented as a function of the dimensionless parameter  @xmath13  @xcite   only . ] , which is defined as the maximum center - of - mass meson momentum in units of meson mass  @xmath14 , or as a function of the excess energy  @xmath5  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ cross_q_eta]a the total cross sections for the reactions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are compared versus the parameter @xmath13 and in figure  [ cross_q_eta]b versus the excess energy .",
    "one immediately notices the qualitative difference between both representations .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 meson production cross section exceeds the @xmath3 cross section by a factor of 2 and more using @xmath13 , whereas the @xmath3 meson cross section is always larger than the @xmath0 one when the @xmath5 scale is employed . to find a proper variable for the comparison of the cross sections for mesons of significantly different masses we recall a definition of the total cross section , which is just the integral over phase space of the squared transition matrix element normalized to the incoming flux factor  f : @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the @xmath17 or @xmath1 meson , @xmath18 denotes the phase space volume , and @xmath19  =  @xmath20  @xcite , with @xmath21 being the square of the total energy in the center - of - mass frame .    1.0 cm    ( 12.2,12.0 ) ( 2.0,0.0 ) ( 10.7,6.6 )",
    "a ) ( 10.7,1.0 ) b )    this definition suggests that a natural variable for comparing the total cross sections for different mesons may be the volume of available phase space  @xcite . note that in case of the same dynamics ( transition matrix element ) for the production of two different mesons we would obtain identical values for the total cross section as a function of @xmath18 independently from the produced meson masses , which would not be the case when the variables @xmath13 or @xmath5 would have been employed .",
    "now , in order to study the proton-@xmath1 interaction we will employ two assumptions  @xcite , which were lively discussed during this conference  @xcite :    \\1 )  in analogy with the _ watson - migdal _",
    "approximation  @xcite for two body processes , we will assume that the complete transition amplitude for a production process @xmath22 factorizes approximately as :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 represents the total production amplitude , @xmath25 describes the elastic interaction among particles in the exit channel , and @xmath26 denotes the reduction factor due to the interaction of the colliding protons .",
    "this factorization , however , is valid only as long as the energy dependence of the total cross section is considered  @xcite .",
    "\\2 )   we will assume also that in the exit channel only the proton - proton interaction is significant ( @xmath27 = @xmath28 ) .",
    "1.0 cm    ( 12.2,10.5 ) ( 3.0,0.0 ) ( 9.5,1.5 ) b ) ( 3.0,4.5 ) ( 9.5,6.0 ) a )    these two assumptions enable us to derive from the measured cross sections the phase space dependence of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31  @xcite , since the @xmath32 amplitude is known and the @xmath26 factor can be calculated according to the formula from reference  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no unequivocal description for the @xmath28 enhancement factor  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to minimize ambiguities resulting from this uncertainties , we consider the ratios @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xcite , which normalize the transition amplitude for @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the one for @xmath3 production @xmath35 . this should be independent of the model used for the determination of @xmath36 , and will allow an estimate of the relative strength of the @xmath3-proton and @xmath37-proton interactions .",
    "indeed , we examined that within the errors the ratio @xmath38 does not depend on the model used for @xmath36 .",
    "as an example , in figure  [ mmnisk ] we show this ratio as obtained from the amplitude @xmath36 taken from references  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ mmnisk]a shows an increasing strength of @xmath39 for the @xmath0 production at low @xmath18 , indicating a strong @xmath0-proton fsi , as was discussed previously for the cross section ratio by caln et al .",
    "note also that the ratio for the @xmath1 meson is constant over the phase space range considered ( figure  [ mmnisk]b ) .",
    "this observation , and the fact that theoretical calculations predict the primary production amplitude to be constant within a few per cent  @xcite independently from the mechanism assumed , allows us to conclude that the @xmath1-proton scattering parameters are in the order of , or smaller than , the proton-@xmath3 ones .",
    "two years ago at the meson98 we presented upper limits for the total cross section of the @xmath40 reaction  @xcite .",
    "at present due to the gained statistics and the understanding of the background we are pleased to present an absolute value for the total cross section at an excess energy of @xmath5  =  17  mev .",
    "the primordial motivation for studying this reaction was presented already ten years ago at this conference hall by w. oelert  @xcite .",
    "it concerns the study of the @xmath41 interaction and the investigation of the structure of the @xmath42(980 ) meson , which is still discussed to be either the usual @xmath43 , the exotic state @xmath44 or a strongly bound @xmath45 molecule .    in order to identify this reaction",
    "the four - momentum vectors for three positively charged particles are determined  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ inv_vs_mm_3356 ] shows the preselected data where two of the positively charged particles are identified as protons . on the vertical axis the measured mass of the third registered particle",
    "is plotted as a function of the mass of an unobserved system . in the case of the @xmath46 reaction both the invariant mass of the third particle and the missing mass    with respect to the identified ( @xmath47 ) subsystem    should correspond to the mass of the kaon . already at this level of analysis",
    "the group of events corresponding to the @xmath46 reaction can be recognized .",
    "the projection of events contained in the horizontal shaded area onto the missing mass axis reveals a clear signal originating from the @xmath41 meson pair production , as presented in figure  [ mmppk ] .",
    "the much broader structure seen on the left side of the peak is due to the @xmath10 meson production associated with the hyperon resonances @xmath12(1405 ) or @xmath48(1385 )   ( eg .",
    "@xmath49 ) . in this case",
    "the missing mass of the pp@xmath10 system corresponds to the invariant mass of the ( @xmath50 ) subsystem .",
    "demanding an additional signal in a silicon pad detector  @xcite at the position expected for the @xmath51 meson the background is reduced by more than one order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this additional requirement diminishes the signal from the @xmath46 by about 50  @xmath52 only  @xcite , which is understood by the decay of the @xmath51 meson on its way to the dedicated silicon detector .    the preliminary analysis of the data taken at the excess energy of @xmath5  =  17  mev results in a cross section value of 2.1  @xmath53  0.8  nb  @xcite .",
    "when compared to the value 200  @xmath53  11  @xmath53  80  nb determined at @xmath5  =  111  mev  @xcite , one observes that the cross section for the production of the @xmath51 meson in the elementary proton - proton collisions increases much stronger than the corresponding one for the @xmath10  @xcite meson .",
