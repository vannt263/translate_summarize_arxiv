    "the doppler velocity technique , which measures the small to and fro motion induced in a parent star by an orbiting planet , has clearly demonstrated that several percent of solar - type stars have planets very _ unlike _ those in the solar system ( marcy , cochran & mayor 2000 ) .",
    "known extrasolar planets are plotted with the nine solar system planets in figure  1 . with the exception of the few bodies orbiting dead stellar cores",
    "known as pulsars , exoplanets discovered to date populate a portion of mass - orbit parameter space that barely overlaps that of solar system planets .",
    "this is due to selection effects of the doppler method which is sensitive to high - mass planets orbiting close to their parent bodies .",
    "the best doppler searches have velocity precisions of 3 to 10  m / s , just below that needed to detect a jovian analog in the most favorable orientation .",
    "a suite of search techniques is thus required to explore the range of masses and orbital characteristics exhibited by solar system planets .",
    "we describe a combined microlensing and transit search ( planet ii ) for extrasolar gas giants that begins this wider exploration .",
    "a general review of microlensing and transit exoplanet searches is given by sackett ( 1999 ) .",
    "2.0cm=9.1 cm -0.2 cm",
    "-0.2 cm    gravitational microlensing occurs when a massive compact object ( such as a star ) passes very near the line - of - sight to a background luminous source ( such as another star ) .",
    "the gravitational field of the foreground `` lens '' bends the light rays from the background `` light bulb '' , resulting in more light reaching the observer s telescope .",
    "significant lensing requires precise source - lens alignment , comparable to the angular radius of the so - called einstein ring , defined as @xmath0^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the lens mass , lens distance , and source star distance , respectively . for typical galactic microlensing , @xmath51  mas , corresponding to separations of @xmath6  au at the position of the lenses .",
    "thus , when these rare precise alignments occur , planetary orbits comparable in size to those of earth and jupiter are detectable .    as an isolated lens , source , and observer move relative to one another , different portions of the lens magnification pattern",
    "are traversed by the source , resulting in a symmetric rising and falling light curve .",
    "if the lens is orbited by another star or a planet , however , more complicated magnification patterns are formed ; the shape of the resulting light curve then depends on the precise source trajectory ( fig .",
    "2 ) , as described by mao & paczynki ( 1991 ) . if the source passes near a defect  or `` caustic ''  in the lensing pattern caused by the companion , an anomalous light curve will result that deviates from the smooth , symmetric light curves of isolated lenses .",
    "precise characterization of the anomaly allows the mass ratio @xmath7 and projected separation @xmath8 of the lens and companion ( in units of @xmath9 ) to be determined .",
    "the size of caustics ( and thus the probability that a random background star will pass near one ) decreases slowly with mass ratio @xmath10 ( dominik 1999 ) , making microlensing an attractive method to search for low - mass planets .    -7.7",
    "cm 0.25cm=12.5 cm -1.0 cm",
    "-0.2 cm    the precise alignment required for microlensing and the vast emptiness of space conspire to reduce the probability of microlensing for background galactic stars at any given time to @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "international groups such as ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1994 ) and moa team ( bond et al .",
    "2001 ) monitor millions of stars nightly in search of these needles in a haystack , issuing real - time electronic alerts when they find them .",
    "the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ) then performs the intensive and sensitive photometric measurements necessary to detect low - mass lensing companions .",
    "because planetary light curve anomalies are short - lived ( several hours to few days ) and rare , planet uses a network of semi - dedicated telescopes longitudinally distributed around the southern hemisphere for round - the - clock monitoring ( albrow et al .",
    "1998 ) .    over its first five years",
    ", planet monitored 43 microlensing events intensely , but found no light curve anomalies attributed to low - mass companions .",
    "( stellar binary systems , with @xmath13 were sometimes observed . ) by computing the detection efficiency of each light curve to planets with given @xmath8 and @xmath10 ( gaudi & sackett 2000 ) , these null results were translated into upper limits on the frequency of gas giants orbiting the most typical stars ( ie . , the lenses ) in the galaxy ( albrow et al .",
    "2001 ; gaudi et al .  2002 ) .",
    "no more than 50% of the lenses can have planets with parameters falling anywhere above the indicated planet  i line sketched in fig .  1 .",
    "specifically , less than 50% of @xmath110.3  m@xmath14 stars have companions with semi - major axes in the range 1.5  au@xmath154  au and masses greater than that of saturn .",
    "the increased number of alerts now issued by ogle and moa allow planet to select and monitor events that have particularly high sensitivity to the presence of planets .",
    "the overall planet detection efficiency is expected to increase by a factor of five , resulting in substantial sensitivity to saturnian - mass planets throughout the range @xmath16  au@xmath17  au in orbital radius ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the expanded program , planet  ii , includes access to the eso  2.2 m telescope ; its wide field of view ( @xmath18 degree on a side ) , enables a simultaneous search for transiting gas giants orbiting solar - type f and g stars in the same fields .",
    "the size of the planet is determined from the depth of the partial eclipse , the orbital period is given by the time between successive transits .",
    "the smaller the orbit , the larger the geometric probability of transiting .",
    "so - called `` hot jupiters , '' with periods of 35 days , have @xmath1110% chance of transiting solar - type parent stars , producing photometric dips of amplitude @xmath111% lasting 13 hours .",
    "about 1% of solar neighborhood stars searched for doppler signals have such planets .",
    "if hot jupiters are equally prevalent around inner galaxy stars , simulations suggest that up to 100 planets could be found per year by searching for partial eclipses in wide - field surveys of the galaxy .",
    "ogle  iii has already found tens of transit candidates ( udalski et al .",
    "2001 ) ; recent test results that the image subtraction technique employed by planet can generate comparable photometry ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "planet  ii will sample fewer fields much more frequently and with higher signal - to - noise when using the eso  2.2 m telescope .",
    "transit and microlensing searches probe two important regimes of the angular momentum exchanging migration process ( trilling et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) thought to be responsible for hot jupiters .",
    "microlensing can detect cool gas giants at the separations ( several au from the parent star ) where they are believed to have formed ; transit photometry is sensitive to hot gas giants that have migrated during their infancy from these birthplaces to small , inner orbits .",
    "proper statistical analysis of the results of both searches would place constraints on the numbers of jovians that migrate , and thus on the physical process itself .",
    "both microlensing and transit photometry have the ability to push the discovery space for extrasolar planets into smaller mass regimes than can be probed by the doppler technique , over a wider range of orbital radii .",
    "uranus- and neptune - mass planets orbiting several au from their parent stars can be detected with microlensing .",
    "less massive planets have caustics so small that light curves probing them will be rare and suffer from finite source size effects that dilute the signal , unless smaller ( and thus fainter ) background stars can be monitored ( bennett & rhie 1996 ; gaudi & sackett 2000 ) .",
    "the best ground - based transit photometry ( @xmath110.001  mag ) is sensitive to planets with radii one - third that of jupiter , i.e. , planets similar to uranus and neptune .",
    "unless ground - based efforts considerably more substantial and precise can be undertaken , the sensitivity to terrestrial - mass planets promised by both techniques will await proposed space missions such as corot , eddington , kepler , mons , most and gest .",
