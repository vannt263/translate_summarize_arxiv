    "some technically details are discussed in the appendices .",
    "our calculation starts with the usual tight - binding hamiltonian for graphene @xmath10 where the second sum runs over nearest - neighbors and @xmath11 is an on - site potential that may depend on position .",
    "the graphene hopping integral @xmath12 picks up a peierls phase in the presence of a magnetic field yielding for the nearest - neighbor coupling element the expression @xmath13 where the line integral is taken along the straight path between sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "the system under consideration is a ring - shaped structure cut out of a graphene sheet , which is attached to two crystalline leads also modeled using the graphene lattice structure ( see fig .  [",

    "the structure is subject to a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath17 resulting from a vector potential @xmath18 as well as a gate electrode potential @xmath19 located on top of the lower arm of the ring . the smoothness of the potential interface is controlled via the smoothing width @xmath20 measured from the lower edges of the leads : @xmath21 taking the origin of coordinates at the center of the ring . in our simulations , we used a cosine - shaped smoothing profile and chose values @xmath22 .    for a fermi energy @xmath23 , together with the adjacent leads this lower arm forms either a @xmath0- or @xmath1-junction for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ( see fig .",

    "note that the setup exhibits a flat potential profile for trajectories along the upper ring arm , i.e. a @xmath26-junction , since there is no gate potential applied .",

    "the coupling of the leads via the hamiltonian @xmath32 describing the ring structure is expressed through dyson s equation . in order to obtain the effective coupling between the leads",
    ", we apply a recursive green s function ( rgf ) technique .",
    "the @xmath29-matrix is then obtained from the system s green s function using the fisher - lee relation .",
    "@xcite      for the calculation of the lead s surface green s functions , we essentially follow ref .  .",

    "since we consider the zero temperature regime , transport takes place at the fermi energy @xmath27 , measured relative to the charge neutrality point in the leads . the approach outlined in ref .   then requires the inversion of the inter - cell matrix @xmath35 .",
    "however this matrix is singular in the case of a graphene lattice . to overcome this problem , we will use an effective description for the leads as outlined in app .",
    "[ sec : app_effleads ] .",
    "this description is based on the fact , that in many cases not all of the atomic sites contained in one cell couple to the adjacent cell .",
    "one can then conveniently divide the unit cells into even- and odd - indexed subcells and eliminate the latter from the calculation by writing down the effective coupling between even - indexed subcells .",
    "this yields an expression of the form @xmath38 with invertible coupling matrices @xmath39 .",
    "as will be shown later , this effective description also has the additional benefit of increased performance of the recursive green s function scheme .",
    "note that since the approach does not depend on details of the matrices @xmath33 and @xmath35 it may also be applied to other lattice structures that exhibit non - invertible coupling matrices or that enable a potential performance gain .",
    "the isolated leads sgfs @xmath30 and @xmath31 are thus obtained according to expressions ( 2.16 ) and ( 2.17 ) of ref .",
    ", respectively , using the effective description ( [ for : effsg ] ) for the leads .      in order to obtain the @xmath29-matrix",
    ", we need to compute the green s function @xmath40 describing the effective coupling between the surface sites of the two leads . to this end",
    ", we apply a variant of the commonly - used rgf scheme .",
    "@xcite as described in app .",
    "[ sec : app_interface ] , in an effective description , the leads have to couple to the conductor through an additional contact slice , which has to be taken into account in contrast to conventional rgf algorithms .",
    "similar to the leads , the sample itself is also divided into slices . the width @xmath41 of the slices",
    "is chosen as small as possible , since the algorithm scales only linear with the length of the sample ( along @xmath7-direction ) but up to third power with the width ( along @xmath6-direction ) .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath42 for zigzag leads and @xmath43 for armchair leads , where @xmath44 is the lattice constant of the honeycomb lattice along the @xmath7-direction , which is @xmath45 in the zigzag case and @xmath46 in the armchair case , @xmath47 being the nearest - neighbor distance in graphene .",
    "the applied rgf procedure then has the following structure :    1 .",

    "increase @xmath51 by one and repeat the previous step until all slices are connected .    in each step",
    "it is sufficient to update the contact slice green s functions .",
    "the green s function ( [ for : fullgf ] ) of the fully coupled leads is updated once when all slices are connected .",
    "@xcite the scheme of a particular step in the recursion is as follows : interpreting the coupling to slice @xmath51 as perturbation to the system of coupled slices up to slice @xmath52 , the green s function describing the coupled system @xmath53 is obtained from the unperturbed green s function @xmath54 and the coupling matrix ( the perturbation ) @xmath55 via dyson s equation @xmath56 here , the index @xmath57 refers to the contact slices , whereas the index @xmath58 refers to the last connected slice of the sample .",
    "@xmath59 is the layer - local hamiltonian of slice @xmath51 of the sample , and the matrices @xmath60 describe the coupling of the contact slices and slice @xmath52 to slice @xmath51 of the sample . for a simple two - terminal setup as we consider here , @xmath61 is non - zero only for @xmath62 , @xmath63 being the total number of slices of the sample .",
    "note that the matrix elements containing an index @xmath64 in ( [ for : rgf_fullgf ] ) do not have to be calculated since they do not appear in the next step of the recursion .",
    "further note that we do not need to add an inconvenient infinitesimal imaginary part to the energy in expression ( [ for : isolatedgf ] ) since it would anyway be absorbed by finite imaginary terms introduced by the fact that we deal with an open quantum system .",
    "the linear conductance of the system is obtained using the landauer formula @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",

    "in the following we present transmission properties for a ring with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . edge disorder is applied to the ring by randomly removing sites within a width @xmath9 from the inner and outer edges of the ring , respectively ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : quantumhall ] , we show the same plot for @xmath89 .",
    "the oscillations diminish at @xmath90 .",
    "this field strength marks the onset of the quantum hall regime , where the cyclotron diameter becomes comparable to the width of the arms of the ring ; an estimate of the graphene cyclotron diameter @xmath91 , taking the fermi velocity at the dirac point in graphene , @xmath92 , yields @xmath93 , a value of same order of magnitude as the width @xmath77 .",
    ", @xmath77 at energy @xmath89 and zero gate voltage , showing the onset of the quantum hall regime . note : the conductance is still finite near zero magnetic field , which is not visible on this scale . ]    by applying a gate voltage @xmath94 to one of the ring arms , the magnitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations may be modified . a convenient measure of the oscillation magnitude is the root mean square ( rms ) amplitude of the signal .",
    "prior to the rms analysis , the ucf background has to be removed from the signal .",
    "this is achieved by applying a high pass frequency filter to the fourier transform of the magnetoconductance data , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourierspectrum ] .",
    "the retained , unbiased signal is squared , and the root of the average over the squared signal is defined as the rms amplitude @xmath95 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsplot ] we show the dependence of the rms oscillation amplitude @xmath95 on the gate voltage @xmath19 for different smoothing widths @xmath20 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) at energy @xmath82 , where the average is taken over the full range @xmath96 . increasing the gate voltage from zero towards the neutrality point @xmath97",
    "not only leads to increased potential scattering but also to a reduction in the number of accessible propagating states in the lower arm of the ring .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsplot ] , the oscillation amplitude diminishes and reaches a minimum value at the neutrality point .",
    "note that , since the transmission through the upper ring arm is not at all affected by a gate potential , the overall conductance itself is only slightly changed to fluctuate around @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diracconductance ] ) as compared to values around @xmath99 in the case of zero gate potential on the lower ring arm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : magnetoconductance ] ) .     for different smoothing widths @xmath100 .",
    "each data point results from an average over five realizations of edge disorder .",
    "the corresponding standard deviations lie between @xmath101 and @xmath102 but are suppressed for better visibility . for better clarity , the spectrum schematics ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : junctiondirac ] ) are also included . ]    , @xmath77 tuned close to the neutrality point in the lower arm with a smooth potential interface ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the plots ( a)(d ) constitute a representative selection and are obtained by variation of the microscopic edge disorder configuration ( which is always chosen randomly ) for values @xmath104 . ]    for @xmath24 , the decay of the rms amplitude towards the neutrality point does not depend on the details of the gate potential interface .",
    "however , in the regime of klein tunneling , @xmath25 , the oscillation behavior strongly depends on the smoothness of the gate potential . in case of a smooth potential ,",
    "the partial waves in the lower arm have to tunnel through a finite region of low density of states , where @xmath105 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , in order to interfere with the partial waves traversing the upper arm .",
    "the lower arm becomes increasingly penetrable as this region gets narrower , until it gets transparent in case of a sharp potential .",
    "this reflects the usual behavior of klein tunneling phenomena , where the probability for tunneling through a @xmath4-junction depends on the smoothness of the @xmath4-interface .",
    "@xcite    the described behavior of the rms amplitude is robust over the whole energy range under consideration , except for an increasing uncertainty at lower values for the fermi energy .",
    "although all results are presented for zigzag boundary conditions in the leads , the effects are independent of a change of orientation of the graphene lattice to armchair boundaries in the leads .",
    "before we conclude , we mention here an additional observation concerning the dependence of the magnitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations on the magnetic field strength @xmath106 , when the lower arm of the ring is tuned near the neutrality point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diracconductance ] ) .",
    "it seems that in this regime the oscillation magnitude is in general significantly lower for low field strength , compared to the oscillations at higher field strength .",
    "this is indeed the case for most of the ring realizations we investigated , though not for all of them ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diracconductance](d ) ) .",
    "the reason for such a behavior is so far not understood .",
    "since the increase in oscillation magnitude can not be related to any particular length scale a connection to the quantum hall effect seems unlikely .",
    "in summary , we have numerically analyzed transport through graphene ring structures in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field based on the recursive green s function formalism . in order to understand the physics of the interplay of the aharonov - bohm effect and klein tunneling in graphene , we have looked at the influence of a local gate over one of the arms of the ring on magnetotransport . by varying the gate voltage ,",
    "we have been able to tune this arm from the @xmath51-type to the @xmath3-type transport regime via the dirac point .",
    "the analysis of the root mean square amplitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations clearly shows that the @xmath3-type signal is smaller for smooth @xmath4-junctions in the ring arm and can recover the full @xmath51-type value only for very sharp @xmath4-junctions .",
    "our predictions nicely complement the analysis of ref .   where both arms of the ring are assumed to be tuned to the charge neutrality point .",
    "this might lead to the first observation of the aharonov - bohm effect caused by transport through evanescent modes or a combination of propagating modes in one arm and evanescent modes in the other arm of the ring .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with c. bruder , k. ensslin , a.f .",
    "morpurgo , p. recher , c. stampfer , m. wimmer , and financial support from the german dfg , the swiss nsf , and the nccr nanoscience .",
    "the leads may be described in an effective manner if some of the atomic sites contained in cell @xmath107 do not couple to the adjacent cell @xmath108 .",
    "one can then conveniently divide the unit cell into two subcells according to @xmath109 resulting in a double - periodic structure as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : celldivision ] , where @xmath110 only describes atomic sites that directly couple to the next cell .",
    "writing @xmath111 then yields the effective description of the lead ( [ for : effsg ] ) where @xmath112 note that simple single - periodic structures are included in the description via @xmath113 .    , and",
    "the second slice that contains those sites which couple to the next unit cell to the right is described by @xmath110 .",
    "analogously , in the armchair case , the first three slices of a unit cell are described by @xmath114 , whereas only the fourth slice is described by @xmath110 . ]    in the case of a graphene lead with zigzag edges in zero magnetic field , the non - vanishing matrix elements of the @xmath115-matrices @xmath116 and @xmath117 may be written in a compact form , @xmath118 where we assumed @xmath119 and a constant on - site matrix element @xmath120 .",
    "of course , the roles of @xmath110 and @xmath114 are interchangeable , dependent on the details of the lead s surface .",
    "obviously , the effective coupling matrix @xmath121 is invertible , in contrast to the original @xmath122 coupling matrix @xmath35 in the non - effective description , which is clearly non - invertible .",
    "additionally , the size @xmath123 of the matrices describing the effective lead is smaller by a factor of two compared to the original description , yielding increased performance , since the computational effort of the applied rgf scheme roughly scales as @xmath124 .",
    "the performance gain is even larger in the case of graphene leads with armchair edges , since then only @xmath125 of the atomic sites within a particular unit cell couple to the next cell .",
    "the derivation is similar to the zigzag case and will not be repeated here .",
    "one point to note is that @xmath39 is not well defined for energy values matching the eigenvalues of @xmath114 , @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath127 corresponds to the charge neutrality point in graphene , where the density of states vanishes and hence there are no propagating modes in the lead that may contribute to the current .",

    "see refs .  .",
    "the subdivision of the graphene lead s unit cell as depicted in fig .",
