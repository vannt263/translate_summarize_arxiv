    "recently attention was drawn to the fact that in various strongly correlated systems the curves of the specific heat @xmath10 vs.   temperature @xmath1 cross once or twice when plotted for different values of a second thermodynamic variable @xmath11.@xcite for example , crossing points are observed for different pressures ( @xmath12 ) in normalfluid @xmath13he ( ref .  ) and heavy - fermion systems such as ceal@xmath14@xcite and ube@xmath14.@xcite by changing the magnetic field ( @xmath15 ) the same feature is seen in heavy - fermion compounds such as cecu@xmath16al@xmath17@xcite and nd@xmath18ce@xmath17cuo@xmath19.@xcite crossings of the specific heat curves are also observed in the simplest lattice model for correlated electrons , the hubbard model,@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dispersion of a single electronic band , @xmath22 the chemical potential , and @xmath2 the local interaction . at half filling the curves @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 always cross at two temperatures .",
    "this is observed , for example , in the case of the model with nearest - neighbor hopping in @xmath23 , @xcite @xmath24,@xcite and @xmath25,@xcite as well as for long - range hopping in @xmath23;@xcite for the latter two systems the specific heat is shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , crossing is found in @xmath23 when a magnetic field @xmath26 is changed at constant @xmath2.@xcite the fact that these crossing points may be very sharp was analyzed in ref .  , and was traced to the properties of certain generalized susceptibilities of the system .    in the following",
    ", we will consider only the crossing of the specific heat curves occuring for @xmath27 in the paramagnetic phase of the hubbard model with a symmetric half - filled band ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we will investigate yet another observation , namely that for small @xmath2 the specific heat at the high - temperature crossing point _ has practically the same value of approximately @xmath29 for all dimensions @xmath5 and dispersions @xmath21 _ , which can be seen also in fig .",
    "this is surprising , because the temperatures at which this crossing occurs are very different for different dispersions and dimensions , and because the maximum value of @xmath0 and its value at the low - temperature crossing point vary strongly , too .",
    "it should be noted that the specific heat , like the entropy , is a dimensionless quantity when expressed in units of @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the temperature at which the curves @xmath0 vs.   @xmath1 cross for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "then the specific heat is _ independent _ of @xmath2 at the crossing temperature @xmath31 , defined by@xcite @xmath32 since we are not concerned with the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath2 , but rather with the crossing point value of @xmath0 for different lattice systems , we consider only the limit of small @xmath2 and define @xmath33    this weak - coupling crossing point can be calculated without approximation using second order perturbation theory in @xmath2 .",
    "higher orders in perturbation theory would be necessary to determine the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath2 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that the value of @xmath3 at the high temperature crossing point is almost universal , and to analyze the origin of this peculiar feature .",
    "we calculate @xmath3 for a half - filled band with a symmetric density of states ( dos ) @xmath35 .",
