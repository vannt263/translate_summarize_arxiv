    "uncertainty regarding the behaviour of nuclear matter in the deep neutron star interior has compromised a complete description of the dense matter equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "various theoretical models in circulation predict a range of macroscopic observables , such as masses , radii , temperatures and maximum rotation rates , and as such are open to scrutiny with empirical data .",
    "relativistic effects complicate such observations , with the true radius , @xmath6 , related to the _ apparent _ radius at a distance ( d @xmath7 ) as @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the mass of the compact object , and @xmath10 the associated gravitational redshift .",
    "theory to date indicates that 7 km @xmath11 @xmath3 @xmath11 20 km , dependent on the stiffness of the eos ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "binary studies suggest a common value of neutron star mass approximately that of the canonical estimate of 1.4 @xmath12 ( @xcite ) . typically , the model neutron star is assumed to have @xmath9 @xmath2 1.4 @xmath12 and @xmath3 @xmath2 13 km ( @xmath6 @xmath2 10 km ) .",
    "based on observations of the neutron star s thermal emission in the extreme uv ( euv ) and soft x - ray bands , it should in principle be feasible to compute the ideal blackbody spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as a function of ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 & @xmath1 ) , and for a known distance @xmath15 , an estimate of the apparent neutron star radius .",
    "it is generally agreed that such a measurement would have a profound impact in constraining eos models .",
    "however , strong galactic @xmath16 absorption at these wavelengths restricts observations to the closest neutron stars , and uncertainty in x - ray detector sensitivities at these low ( @xmath4 0.2 kev ) energies ( e.g. @xcite ) has compromised attempts to accurately determine estimates for @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , such an analysis may be complicated by neutron star phenomenology , such as atmospheric opacity effects , an active magnetosphere , hot polar cap regions and accretion processes .",
    "it is critical to separate the various contributions , so as to estimate the genuine total surface component . for the older , isolated neutron stars ( ins ) , phase - resolved studies in the soft x - ray , euv and optical wavebands can provide such a sed , and thus a real possibility of determining @xmath3 .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans tail in the optical regime provides stringent constraints to any sed model - fit , and in this waveband atmospheric opacity effects are expected to have the most noticeable impact . in the x - ray regime",
    "where the blackbody continuum peaks , low @xmath17 atmospheres preferentially transmit radiation from the lower , hotter regions of the photosphere , producing a x - ray spectrum suggestive of a hotter source ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans tail is unaffected by this deviation , and discrepancies between optical spectrophotometry and higher energy extrapolations may be rigorously tested ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the intrinsic faintness of these astrophysical objects in the optical regime coupled with the limitations of current technology have restricted previous optical studies to deep integrated photometry .",
    "these observations have in some ways aided such thermal continuum studies ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the differentiation of pulsed ( predominantly nonthermal ) and unpulsed ( thermal ) components would be ideal in a more rigorous treatment .",
    "recently , the triffid high speed optical photometer detected pulsations in the @xmath0 band from the optical counterparts of the middle aged pulsars geminga and psr b0656 + 14 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both light curves are highly pulsed and suggest a dominant nonthermal mode of emission optically . despite their extreme faintness , it was possible in both cases to determine upper limits to each pulsar s thermal component of emission . in this letter , we combine these unpulsed limits with the results of recently published ground - based and hst photometric analysis on these two pulsars ( @xcite , @xcite hereafter @xmath18 & @xmath19 ) , and derive radius / distance estimates for both . in particular , for the case of geminga with a known parallax distance of @xmath2 160 pc , we provide for the first time an upper limit for @xmath3 based upon such phase - resolved photometry .",
    "we approach the analysis of the optical photometry by assuming a model fit incorporating both nonthermal power - law and thermal components of emission in the ubvri regime , as originally adopted by @xmath18 .",
    "this two - component model fit is defined as : @xmath20\\times 10^{-0.4 a(\\nu)}~,\\ ] ] with @xmath21 = 8.766 @xmath22 hz an arbitrary reference frequency , and @xmath23 the interstellar extinction determined following savage & mathis ( 1979 ) . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are taken to be the values of the nonthermal and thermal fluxes at @xmath26 .",
    "the latter can be expressed , for the chosen value of @xmath21 , as @xmath27 where @xmath28  k is the apparent neutron star brightness temperature , @xmath29  km the radius and @xmath30  pc the distance to the blackbody .",
    "model fits for both pulsars have suggested the presence of both emission modes , yet uncertainty in the optimum ( @xmath13,@xmath14 , @xmath1 ) solution based on euv / soft x - ray datasets restricts accurate differentiation . by providing upper bounds for the unpulsed flux , and indirectly @xmath14 via the estimated @xmath23 towards the pulsar , we can derive an _",
    "independent _ estimate of @xmath31 and in this way , constrain ( @xmath13 , @xmath1 ) space .",
    "the use of the lower bounds to @xmath13 for a given neutron star would then yield _ upper _ bounds to the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "psr 0633 + 17 , or geminga , provides one of the most ideal neutron stars for such an analysis , as hst observations have determined its distance by parallax to @xmath32 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is by no means clear precisely what the nature of its emission processes are , despite considerable observational efforts from the optical to @xmath33-rays .",
    "original rosat observations suggested dominant thermal emission from the surface modulated by a hotter polar cap ( @xcite ) , although later observations especially those of _ asca _ indicated the emission was thermal and nonthermal in origin ( @xcite ) .",
    "disagreement remains on the optimum sed fits to data from rosat , euve and asca with the pulsar s surface temperature within @xmath34 k. there have been further suggestions that the pulsar s thermal emission is strongly affected by magnetospheric cyclotron resonance blanketing ( @xcite ) , which would severely compromise any estimate of the _ true _ neutron star surface temperature .",
    "optical observations suggest an unusual sed , with deviations in the expected functional form , possibly as a result of ion cyclotron absorption / emission processes .",
    "the most recent of such observations ( @xmath19 ) , made using the keck lris , spanned 370 - 800 nm and yielded a flat power law shape ( @xmath35 @xmath36  @xmath37 ) and a noticeable broad dip at 630 - 650 nm with perhaps a slight modulation at @xmath38 , @xmath0 @xmath39 @xmath40 as advanced by bignami et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . the composite power - law may be fitted by either a combined blackbody and power - law ( i.e. nonthermal emission with @xmath41 @xmath2 @xmath42 ) or a blackbody plus global ion cyclotron emission .",
    "the former model is undoubtedly the most likely , following the discovery of a highly pulsed lightcurve in the @xmath0 band ( @xcite ) .",
    "1 . shows the model - fit spectrum of @xmath19 with the results of shearer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "3.0truein    a value of @xmath31 = 4.4 is obtained by applying a solution in the form of ( 3 ) to the best - fit keck observations of @xmath19 , setting a(@xmath43 ) @xmath2 0 due to the pulsar s close proximity . introducing our independently estimated unpulsed upper limit in the @xmath0 band of @xmath44 , we conclude with @xmath31 @xmath4 @xmath45 , allowing errors in @xmath31 for the spectral response of the mama/@xmath0-filter combination .",
    "the decrease can be inferred as either a reduction in the emission area or a drop in @xmath13 ( @xmath15 @xmath2 160 pc ) . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects the nonthermal component to increase proportionately in the original model fit , if this unpulsed estimate is representative of a general surface based thermal emission .",
    "if we assume that @xmath13 remains unchanged , then the obvious conclusion is that @xmath6 has been overestimated .",
    "in fact , using @xmath31 @xmath4 3.6 , @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath46 k ( mhs98 ) and @xmath15 = @xmath32 pc suggests @xmath3",
    "@xmath4 @xmath47 km for a @xmath2 blackbody source ( indistinguishable from a fe / si atmosphere - see @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the change in @xmath31 could be understood under the assumption of atmospheric opacity effects for the total surface thermal emission at x - ray energies .",
    "as @xmath18 point out , there is no ideal way to reconcile the actual brightness temperature with the estimated x - ray @xmath13 .",
    "fits with magnetized ( @xmath2 @xmath48 g ) @xmath5 atmospheres suggest that a spectrum in the optical regime can be fitted as a rayleigh - jeans tail with @xmath49 ( @xmath18 ) . applying this correction yields @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath50 km .",
    "an extensive literature exists devoted to the analysis of exosat , rosat and euve observations of the pulsar psr b0656 + 14 .",
    "the consensus is of thermal emission from the surface , modulated by emission from a hot polar cap and from nonthermal activity in the magnetosphere .",
    "however , its distance estimate is by no means exact ranging from @xmath2 100 to 760 pc ( @xcite ) - the latter based upon a dm fit to the uncertain galactic electron model in this vicinity ( taylor et al .",
    "1993 ) . applying a common distance estimate of @xmath2 500 pc , a range of solutions",
    "are possible in ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) space assuming the canonical model , and this is reflected in the literature , with @xmath13 = ( 3 - 9)@xmath51 k and @xmath14 = ( 0.5 - 2.0)@xmath52 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "early limited observations using the @xmath53 ( @xcite ) and the @xmath54 ( @xcite ) indicated that the optical counterpart s emission was predominately nonthermal in nature , and a subsequent two - component model fit to detailed @xmath54 and ground - based photometry spanning the ubvri regime by @xmath18 substantiated this assessment - although the detection of highly pulsed emission in the @xmath0 band ( @xcite ) from the optical counterpart unequivocally confirmed this hypothesis . the upper limit on the unpulsed flux from the resulting lightcurve",
    "was estimated to be @xmath55 .",
    "2 . shows the @xmath18 model fit with these pulsed / unpulsed fluxes .",
    "@xmath18 fitted the observed ubvri spectrum with a two - component model following the formalism of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . applying the interstellar extinctions determined for the three estimated colour excesses towards the pulsar of @xmath56 = 0.01 , 0.03 and 0.05 yielded best fit values of @xmath31 = 3.0 , 3.7 and 4.3 respectively .",
    "taking @xmath57 = @xmath58 , ( 2 ) may be rearranged in terms of @xmath31 , and solved for the three @xmath56 estimates , concluding with @xmath31 = 4.4 , 4.8 and 5.2 ( all @xmath59 ) . respectively .",
    "an increase of this @xmath31 parameter is consistent with either an increase in the expected @xmath13 , emission area or a decrease in the pulsar s distance .",
    "3.0truein    in terms of previous model fits , @xmath31 ranges from 0.9 ( @xcite ) , 2.1 ( @xcite ) to 2.6 ( @xcite ) , the latter incorporating a magnetised ( @xmath60 g ) @xmath5 atmosphere . as observations have accrued , and uncertainties in x - ray detector sensitivities have been addressed , the trend has been a decrease in the derived surface temperature , from @xmath61k to @xmath62k",
    ". recent work by edelstein et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which substituted euve ds data in place of the uncertain low energy rosat pspc channels , has yielded a ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) space differing markedly from earlier rosat results alone . combining this new parameter space with independent model",
    "fits incorporating the @xmath0 unpulsed upper limit suggests @xmath13 @xmath63 5.0@xmath51 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to constrain @xmath1 for b0656 + 14 in two ways - firstly by determining apparent expected radii using both column density and @xmath64 derived distances , and secondly by applying canonical or otherwise derived radius limits to yield optimum distance scales .",
    "@xmath14 estimates towards psr b0656 + 14 , although by no means certain , suggest that the pulsar is @xmath2 250 - 280 pc ( @xcite , @xcite ) , rather closer than the dm derived distance of @xmath65 pc . by manipulation of ( 3 ) with @xmath13",
    "@xmath63 5.0@xmath51 k and the range of @xmath31 parameters determined from the unpulsed upper limit , the expected radial estimates for the @xmath14 distances are 14.7 @xmath11 @xmath3 @xmath11 17.7 km , and substantially greater in the case of the radio derived distance .",
    "we note that such radii estimates are _ in excess _ of the 14 km upper limit determined by walter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the old ins rxj185635 - 3754 . alternatively , applying the ideal canonical @xmath3 @xmath2 13 km , manipulation of ( 3 ) as above suggests that 205 @xmath4 @xmath15 @xmath4 227 pc based upon the range of @xmath66 estimates .",
    "this supports the conclusions of @xmath18 although placing the pulsar somewhat in closer proximity than had been originally thought . indeed",
    "if one was to consider the proposed estimate of @xmath3 @xmath2 @xmath47 km for geminga as a working upper limit , this would place psr b0656 + 14 at a distance of no less than @xmath15 = @xmath67 for the suggested optimum colour index of @xmath66 = 0.03 ( pwc97 )",
    "the acquisition and analysis of optical photometric data on ins has been shown to provide an independent dataset from which constraints to the optimum thermal spectral energy distribution may be applied .",
    "we have attempted for the first time to apply the phase - resolved optical flux consistent with that expected _ specifically _ from the thermal component to the previous integrated analysis of the pulsars geminga and psr b0656 + 14 . despite being upper limits to the unpulsed optical flux in the @xmath0 band",
    ", we find that in both cases , the resulting blackbody spectral distribution is constrained to the extent that we can set upper limits to the @xmath1 parameter for both neutron stars . for the case of geminga , with a known parallax derived distance of @xmath2 160 pc and using the lower @xmath13 limit , we suggest that @xmath3 @xmath4 9.5 km for a @xmath2 blackbody source , and @xmath3 @xmath4 10.0 km with the presence of a magnetized @xmath5 atmosphere .",
    "previous work using these unpulsed upper limits has suggested a @xmath13 @xmath63 5.0@xmath51 k for the pulsar b0656 + 14 ( golden , 1998 ) , and under the assumption of @xmath3 @xmath2 13 km , places the pulsar at @xmath2 210 pc - in contrast to the @xmath64 derived distance of 760 pc . assuming the neutron star has @xmath3 @xmath4 9.5 km",
    ", then this limits the distance to @xmath2 160 pc .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the pulsar may be a viable candidate for a parallax measurement attempt using the hst .    despite using upper limits to the unpulsed fluxes of these two ins ,",
    "we have been successful in indicating how important such definitive measurements are in the rigorous derivation of a given neutron star s thermal parameters . in this way",
    ", we have independently provided limits to the radius of one , geminga , and the distance of another , psr b0656 + 14 and shown the promise to future studies this observational technique offers .",
    "this short report documenting these results is most timely , following on from a recent forum on the study of ins in this energy regime , at which the future importance of such high speed photometric studies was stressed ( @xcite ) , and where a recent theoretical analysis based upon the discovery of rxj185635 - 3754 has shown that neutron star radii should be ideally @xmath4 10 km if one can hope to effectively constrain the eos ( @xcite ) . that our results point to such a radius limit only emphasises the need for further high speed photometry of both pulsars , particularly geminga , so as to provide definitive , rather than upper limit , fluxes of their unpulsed emission .",
