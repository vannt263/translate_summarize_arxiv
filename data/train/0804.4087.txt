    "the successful preparation of monolayer graphene has allowed the possibility of studying the properties of electrons in graphene @xcite .",
    "the nature of quasiparticles called dirac electrons in these two - dimensional systems is very different from those of the conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) realized in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "graphene has a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms .",
    "the quasiparticles in graphene have a band structure in which electron and hole bands touch at two points in the brillouin zone . at",
    "these dirac points the quasiparticles obey the massless dirac equation . in other words , they behave as massless dirac particles leading to a linear dispersion relation @xmath3 ( with the characteristic velocity @xmath4 .",
    "this difference in the nature of the quasiparticles in graphene from conventional 2deg has given rise to a host of new and unusual phenomena such as anamolous quantum hall effects and a @xmath1 berry phase@xcite@xcite .",
    "besides the fundamental interest in understanding the electronic properties of graphene there is also serious suggestions that it can serve as the building block for nanoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "in addition to the graphene monolayer , there has been a lot of interest in investigating the properties of bilayer graphene .",
    "the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene exhibit a parabolic dispersion relation which implies that they are massive particles .",
    "these quasiparticles are also chiral and are described by spinor wavefunctions@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work on graphene multilayers has also shown the existance of dirac electrons with a linear energy spectrum in monolayer graphene and a parabolic spectrum for dirac electrons in bilayer@xcite .",
    "bilayer graphene consists of two monolayers stacked as in natural graphite .",
    "this , bernal stacking , yields a unit cell of four atoms with the result that there are four electronic bands . in @xmath5 space",
    ", the bilayer has a hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "its physical properties are mainly determined by the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions at two inequivalent corners of the brillouin zone , @xmath6 and @xmath7 where the @xmath8 conduction and @xmath1 valence bands meet at the fermi surface . due to the strong interlayer coupling both the conduction and valence bands",
    "are split  by an energy @xmath9 near the @xmath6 and @xmath10 valleys .",
    "only two of these bands , upper valence and lower conduction band , are relevant at low energy and they can be described by the effective hamiltonian given below@xcite    it was found years ago that if conventional 2deg is subjected to artificially created periodic potentials it leads to the appearence of weiss oscillations in the magnetoresistance . this type of electrical modulation of the 2d system can be carried out by depositing an array of parallel metallic strips on the surface or through two interfering laser beams @xcite .",
    "weiss oscillations were found to be the result of commensurability of the electron cyclotron diameter at the fermi energy and the period of the electric modulation .",
    "these oscillations were found to be periodic in the inverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "recently , an investigation of electric field modulation effects on transport properties in monolayer graphene has led to the prediction of enhanced weiss oscillations in the magnetoconductivity@xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnetoplasmons spectrum , density of states , bandwidth and thermodynamics properties of monolayer graphene in the presence of electrical modulation have been investigated so far@xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in studying the effects of electric modulation on magnetoconductivity in bilayer graphene and we compare the results obtained with those of monolayer graphene and the conventional 2deg .",
    "we consider symmetric bilayer graphene within the single electron approximation described by the following effective hamiltonian ( @xmath11 here)@xcite@xmath12{c}% 0\\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( } p_{x}-ip_{y}\\text{)}^{2}\\\\ \\text{(}p_{x}+ip_{y}\\text{)}^{2}\\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ } 0\\text { } % \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , with the vector potential expressed in the landau gauge as @xmath14 and the magnetic field is @xmath15which is perpendicular to the bilayer graphene , @xmath16 is the effective mass of the electrons in bilayer : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the usual electron mass .",
    "the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction in the presence of the magnetic field are@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cyclotron frequency . for the low magnetic fields considered in this work",
    ", the hamiltonian of eq.(1 ) and the landau level spectrum in eq.(2 ) adequately captures the low energy electronic properties in bilayer in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite .",

    "we apply standard perturbation theory to determine the first order correction to the unmodulated energy eigenvalues in the presence of modulation with the result@xmath31 where@xmath32 @xmath33and @xmath34 are laguerre polynomials .    from equations ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , the energy eigenvalues for the system in the presence of modulation are@xmath35 from equation ( 6 ) we observe that the formerly sharp landau levels are now broadened into minibands by the modulation potential .",
    "furthermore , the landau bandwidth ( @xmath36 ) oscillate as a function of @xmath37 , since @xmath34 is an oscillatory function of its index .",
    "the bandwidth contains an average of laguerre polynomials with indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "to compare , in the electrically modulated monolayer graphene the bandwidth depends on a linear combination of laguerre polynomials with indices @xmath37 and @xmath39 whereas for standard electrons in 2deg there is only a single term that contains laguerre polynomial with index @xmath37 .",
    "we expect that this modulation induced change in the electronic density of states to influence the magnetoconductivity of bilayer graphene and this is calculated in the following section .",
    "to determine the magnetoconductivity in the presence of weak electric modulation we apply the kubo formula in the linear response regime .",
    "in the presence of the magnetic field , the main contribution to the weiss oscillations in magnetoconductivity arises from scattering induced migration of the larmor circle center .",
    "this is the diffusive conductivity and we shall determine it following the approach in@xcite . in the case of quasielastic scattering of the electrons ,",

    "@xmath47 does not contribute as the component of velocity in the @xmath48-direction is zero here .",
    "the collisional contribution due to impurities is not taken into account in this work .",
    "the summation in eq.(7 ) over the quantum numbers @xmath46 can be written as@xmath49 where @xmath50 is area of the system .",
    "the component of velocity required in eq.(7 ) can be calculated from the following expression@xmath51 substituting the expression for @xmath52 obtained in eq.(6 ) into eq.(9 ) yields @xmath53 with the results obtained in eqs.(8 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) we can express the diffusive contribution to the conductivity given by eq.(7 ) as@xmath54 where@xmath55 and the dimensionless conductivity of bilayer graphene @xmath56 is given as @xmath57^{2}}[l_{n}(u)+l_{n-2}(u)]^{2}. \\label{13}%\\ ] ] where @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 is the fermi energy .",
    "to get a better understanding of the results of the previous section we will consider the asymptotic expression of conductivity where analytic results in terms of elementary functions can be obtained@xcite .",
    "we shall compare the asymptotic results for the dimensionless conductivity obtained in this section with the results obtained for the electrically modulated conventional 2deg system .",
    "we shall also compare these results with recently obtained results for the monolayer graphene that is subjected to only the electric modulation .",
    "the asymptotic expression of dimensionless conductivity can be obtained by using the following asymptotic expression for the laguerre polynomials@xmath60 note that the asymptotic results are valid when many landau levels are filled .",
    "we  now take the continuum limit:@xmath61 to express the dimensionless conductivity in eq.(13 ) as the following integral@xmath62^{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{u}{n}% } \\cos^{2}(\\sqrt{u / n})\\cos^{2}(2\\sqrt{nu}-\\frac{\\pi}{4 } ) \\label{16}%\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and the dimensionless magnetic field @xmath64 is introduced as @xmath65 with @xmath66    now assuming that the temperature is low such that @xmath67 and replacing @xmath68 , we rewrite the above integral as@xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dimensionless fermi momentum of the electron . to obtain an analytic solution",
    "we have also replaced @xmath71 by @xmath59 in the above integral except in the sine term in the integrand .",
    "the above expression can be expressed as @xmath72 the above integration can be performed by using the following identity @xmath73 with the result@xmath74   \\right ] \\label{20}%\\ ] ] where @xmath75  is the characteristic damping temperature of weiss oscillations in bilayer graphene : @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "we will now compare the results obtained in this work with results obtained in @xcite for the case of electrically modulated monolayer graphene system .",
    "we will first compare the energy spectrum in the two cases .",
    "the difference in the energy spectrum due to modulation effects was obtained in eq.(6 ) .",
    "if we compare this result with the corresponding expression for the electrically modulated monolayer graphene case , we find the following differences : firstly , in the monolayer we have an average of two successive laguerre polynomials with indices @xmath37 and @xmath39 whereas here we also have the average of two laguerre polynomials but not successive ones but rather with indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "secondly , in the monolayer the energy eigenvalues are multiplied by the square root of the landau band index @xmath79 whereas in the bilayer we have @xmath80 factor .",
    "thirdly , the cyclotron frequency in the two systems is different since the quasiparticles in monolayer are massless dirac particles whereas they have a finite mass in the bilayer .",
    "these differences cause the velocity expression for the electrons given by eq.(10 ) to be different in the two systems .",
    "we now compare the expressions for dimensionless conductivity @xmath56 given by eq .",
    "( 20 ) with the electrically modulated case ( eq.(22 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the argument of the cosine terms in the expression for bilayer are 2@xmath81 whereas in monolayer it is @xmath81 which results in the phase difference of @xmath1 in the the dimensionless conductivity in the two systems .",
    "this we expect as the quasiparticles in graphene ( both monolayer and bilayer ) are chiral and acquire a berry s phase in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the berry s phase acquired by dirac electrons in monolayer graphene is @xmath1 whereas it is @xmath2 for particles in bilayer graphene@xcite .",
    "therefore we observe a difference in phase of @xmath1 in the magnetoconductivity oscillations in the two systems .",
    "the dimensionless magnetoconductivity for both electrically modulated mono- and bi - layer graphene as a function of inverse magnetic field is shown in fig.(1)at temperature @xmath82 , electron density @xmath83 and period of modulation @xmath84.we also observe that in the region of high magnetic field sdh oscillations are superimposed on the weiss oscillations .",
    "the oscillations are periodic in @xmath85 and the period depends on electron density as @xmath86",
    "we start by comparing the energy spectrum and velocity expression obtained in eq.(6 ) and eq.(10 ) with similar expressions for the conventional 2deg where the the quasiparticles are standard electrons @xcite . for the energy spectrum , we find that the landau level spectrum is significantly different from that of standard electrons in conventional 2deg .",
    "the first term @xmath87 in eq.(6 ) has to be compared with @xmath88 with @xmath89 for standard electrons .",
    "not only the dependence on the landau level index @xmath37 is different in the two systems but the cyclotron frequency is also not the same due to the difference in mass of the quasiparticles .",
    "the modulation effects are carried by the second term where the essential difference is in the structure of the function @xmath90 we find that there is a basic difference : in bilayer we have a sum of two laguerre polynomials with indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 whereas only a single laguerre polynomial appears in the corresponding term for standard electrons in 2deg .",
    "this difference in the @xmath91 function causes the velocity expression for the electrons in bilayer given by eq.(10 ) to be different from that of the standard electrons . to highlight the difference in the dimensionless conductivity in the two systems ,",
    "we compare the asymptotic expression in bilayer eq.(20 ) with the corresponding expression for 2deg ( eq .",
    "( 25 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that dimensionless conductivity in bilayer has an additional prefactor @xmath92 which is not present in the corresponding expression for 2deg .",
    "in addition , conductivity in bilayer contains the characteristic damping temperature @xmath75 which is higher than the corresponding damping temperature in 2deg @xmath93 due to the smaller effective mass of the quasiparticles in bilayer .",
    "this results in the magnetoconductivity oscillations to be more robust with temperature than in 2deg . to see the effects of this difference on the magnetoconductivity we present the dimensionless magnetoconductivity for both electrically modulated bilayer graphene and the electrically modulated standard 2deg in fig.(2),as a function of inverse magnetic field at temperature @xmath82 , electron density @xmath83 and period of modulation @xmath84 .",
    "we find that the there is a difference in phase of @xmath2 between the oscillations in magnetoconductivity in the two systems since the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene are chiral .",
    "a berry s phase of @xmath2 is acquired by the quasiparticles in bilayer relative to the standard electrons resulting in the appearence of @xmath2 phase difference in the magnetoconductivity oscillations .",
    "we also find a peak in magnetoconductivity in 2deg that is absent in bilayer which is due to the absence of contribution from the @xmath94 and @xmath95 landau levels as they lie at zero energy .",
    "we also find that the magnetoconductivity oscillations in bilayer graphene are less damped by temperature and are more prounced as compared to those in conventional 2deg system whereas they are less pronounced and are more damped with temperature compared to those in monolayer graphene .",
    "this can be seen in fig.(3 ) where dimensionless conductivity as a function of inverse magnetic field is presented for the three systems .",
    "the parameters used are : @xmath82 , electron density @xmath83 and period of modulation @xmath84 .",
    "this can be understood by considering the temperature scale for damping of weiss oscillations in bilayer graphene obtained from eq.(20 ) which is characterized by @xmath75 given as @xmath96 whereas the characteristic tempererature for 2deg is given in @xcite as @xmath97 comparing @xmath75 and @xmath93 the essential difference is the difference in the effective masses of the quasiparticles in the two systems .",
    "since the quasiparticles in bilayer have a smaller effective mass @xmath98 the characteristic damping temperature @xmath75 is higher in bilayer than in conventional 2deg characterized by @xmath93 .",
    "hence weiss oscillations in magnetoconductivity in bilayer graphene are less damped with temperature compared to 2deg system .",
    "we have investigated the diffusive magnetoconductivity component @xmath0 in bilayer graphene in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and a one - dimensional weak electric modulation . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the weiss oscillations in magnetoconductivity .",
    "we have compared the results obtained with those of electrically modulated monolayer graphene as well as electrically modulated conventional 2deg system .",
    "we find phase differences of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the magnetoconductivity oscillations compared to monolayer graphene and conventional 2deg system which arises due to the chiral nature of quasiparticles in graphene.we also find that the oscillations due to modulation in the magnetoconductivity are enhanced and less damped with temperature compared to conventional 2deg system whereas they are less robust with temperature compared to monolayer graphene .",
