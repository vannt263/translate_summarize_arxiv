    "all detected binary systems at tev @xmath0-rays belong to the class of high mass binaries in which compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) appears very close to the stellar surface at least during a part of its orbit .",
    "in fact , tev @xmath0-rays have been expected on theoretical grounds from the well known be binary system , psr b1259 - 63/ss2883 , containing 47.7 ms pulsar since it was well known that even isolated pulsars with similar parameters should emit tev @xmath0-rays ( e.g. the crab pulsar and its nebula ) .",
    "such emission has been discovered from this object during the periastron passage of the pulsar in 2004 ( aharonian et al .",
    "a year later , emission from two compact binary systems , ls 5039 and lsi + 61 303 , classified as microquasars , have been observed by hess and magic telescopes ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005b , albert et al .  2006 ) .",
    "this emission is clearly modulated with the orbital periods of the binary systems ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 , albert et al .",
    ". moreover , there are evidences of detection of the tev @xmath0-ray flare from another microquasar cyg x-1 ( albert et al .  2007 ) .",
    "finally , the hess discovered the tev emission from the open cluster westerlund 2 which contains the most massive binary system of two wr type stars , wr 20a ( aharonian et al .",
    "this emission might also be related to this very unusual binary system .",
    "tev @xmath0-ray production in binary system containing energetic pulsar is usually interpreted in terms of the leptonic ic scattering model in which relativistic electrons scatter soft radiation coming from the massive star ( e.g. see scenarios discussed by maraschi & treves  1981 , tavani & arons  1997 , kirk et al .  1999 ) .",
    "similar radiation processes have been also considered in more detail in the case of electrons accelerated in the jets of microquasars ( e.g. bosch ramon et al .",
    "2006 , dermer & bttcher  2006 ) . in these calculations",
    "the absorption of @xmath0-ray photons on the stellar radiation is usually not taken into account or considered only in approximate way .",
    "more recently @xmath0-ray emission from one - directional ic @xmath1 pair cascades ( secondary leptons move in the direction of primary @xmath0-ray photons ) have been considered in a few papers ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 , orellana et al .",
    "2007 , khangulyan et al .  2008 ) .    here",
    ", we discuss the three dimensional ic @xmath1 pair cascade scenario for the tev @xmath0-ray origin in the massive binary systems which have been developed in the late 90-ties ( e.g. bednarek  2000 ) and later applied to these type of sources in a sequence of recent papers ( bednarek  2005 , 2006a , b , 2007 , bednarek & giovannelli  2007 , sierpowska - bartosik  2007 , sierpowska & bednarek  2005 , sierpowska - bartosik & bednarek  2008 , sierpowska - bartosik & torres  2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "6.truecm    the optical depth in the massive star radiation has been calculated in a few papers with different simplified assumptions .",
    "the most general one ( which can be applied to the case of injection source at arbitrary location around the massive star ) can be found in bednarek ( 2000 ) .",
    "these calculations take into account the dimensions of the massive star which is specially important in the case of very compact binaries of the type recently detected at tev @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "only these calculations can be applied for the case of the simulation of the full problem of the anisotropic cascade initiated by primary leptons or @xmath0-rays in the radiation field of the massive star since in such a case parts of the cascade can also develop very close to the surface of the massive star .    note , that these early calculations of the optical depths can be simply scaled for the massive stars with other parameters , i.e. radius and surface temperature .",
    "let us denote the parameters of the reference calculations by stars and the parameters of the optical depths for other stars by @xmath2 .",
    "then , this simple scaling formula can be described as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , distance from the star , d , is measured in the stellar units , and @xmath6 is the injection angle .",
    "therefore _ there is no need for separate calculations of the optical depths for the stars with other parameters_. such example calculations which may serve as the base for the scaling procedure according to eq .",
    "1 has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( see also bednarek 2000 ) .",
    "the optical depths inside most of the massive binary systems mentioned above , for the location of the @xmath0-ray source at the distance of the compact object from the massive star , can reach values above ten .",
    "the only exception is the system psr 1259 - 63/ss2883 .",
    "however , as we have shown in sierpowska - bartosik & bednarek  ( 2008 ) , it is likely that electrons also in this binary system can be accelerated much closer to the surface of the massive star than the distance of the periastron passage . at such distances the optical depths for @xmath0-rays",
    "can be larger than unity .",
    "therefore , we conclude that when calculating the @xmath0-ray spectra from all these binary systems , the cascade processes has to be taken into account .",
    "the acceleration of electrons injected somewhere inside the binary system occurs in strong radiation field of the nearby massive star and also in its magnetic field .",
    "the maximum energies of electrons depend on the efficiency of their energy losses on these two processes , on the efficiency of acceleration process , and on the escape conditions from acceleration region .",
    "moreover , in some situations also the radiation produced by the compact object itself can serve as a target for electrons .",
    "therefore , the spectrum and maximum energies of electrons , depend on the conditions which are not usually well known and some simplified assumptions are necessary .",
    "we limit our considerations only to the case when the dominant energy loss mechanism is provided by the synchrotron and ic energy losses ( the radiation and magnetic field of the massive star can be uniquely defined ) .    in order to consider the radiation processes of accelerated electrons",
    ", someone usually assumes that electrons are injected mono - energetically or with the power law spectrum .",
    "electrons produce first generation of @xmath0-rays by ic scattering of stellar radiation with specific angular distribution , since they are injected into anisotropic radiation field ( the stellar radiation arrives from specific directions in respect to electron ) . moreover , secondary @xmath0-rays see also anisotropic radiation field of the massive star .",
    "so then , their escape / absorption conditions strongly depend on their direction in respect to the massive star .",
    "therefore , the whole process of @xmath0-ray production in such scenario becomes very complicated even without including secondary processes such as synchrotron losses of secondary leptons .",
    "such cascade process can be considered in the three limiting cases :    1 .   one - dimensional linear cascade .",
    "2 .   three dimensional cascade with isotropization of secondary leptons .",
    "3 .   three dimensional cascade with leptons following the magnetic field .    all these cases are approximations of the case realized in practice and they might give reasonable approximation in specific parts of the binary system . in the case",
    "( 1 ) , secondary leptons , produced as a result of absorption of @xmath0-rays in the stellar radiation , propagate linearly in the direction of the parent @xmath0-ray photon .",
    "this is the simplest possible case but also the least realistic for @xmath0-rays injected relatively close to the massive star ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the larmor radius of secondary leptons in a typical magnetic field of the massive star is significantly lower than the characteristic interaction length on the ic scattering of tev leptons in the radiation field of the massive star . as an example , let as consider the case of the massive star with the surface magnetic field of the order of 300 g. at the characteristic distance of the tev @xmath0-ray source inside massive binary system ( equal to @xmath8 ) the magnetic field strength is @xmath9 g. the larmor radius of 1 tev leptons is then equal to @xmath10 cm .",
    "on the other hand , the characteristic distance scale for ic scattering in the thomson regime in the radiation of the massive star with surface temperature @xmath11 k and above mentioned distance , @xmath12 , is @xmath13 cm .",
    "this is clearly larger than @xmath14 which means that leptons are isotropized or driven by the magnetic field before interacting with stellar photons .",
    "note , that ic scattering of secondary leptons with tev energies occurs in fact in the kn regime and the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath14 is larger for distances closer to the massive star at which the compact object is located .",
    "these two additional effects strengthen the conclusion that inside the binary system secondary leptons can not follow the direction of the parent @xmath0-ray photon and their trajectories are significantly re - directed before the ic interaction with the stellar photon .",
    "therefore , we consider only the cascade scenarios according to ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the difference between these two cases depends on the domination of the main component of the magnetic field around the massive star . in the earlier approach ( 2 )",
    ", it has been assumed that the random component is enough important to isotropize secondary leptons produced in the cascade process .",
    "this occurs when the larmor radius of secondary leptons is much smaller than the characteristic ics length .",
    "also the synchrotron energy losses are neglected in respect to ic energy losses ( for discussion of these conditions see sect .  2 in bednarek  1997 ) in the recent calculations ( 3 ) , we follow the paths of secondary leptons in the magnetic field with the dipole structure and",
    "also subtract their energy losses on synchrotron process ( see details in sierpowska & bednarek  ( 2005 ) .",
    "three geometrical scenarios for the acceleration of electrons has been considered up to now , i.e. injection of particles : ( a ) along the shock structure which appears due to the presence of energetic pulsar or by pulsar itself ; ( b ) along the jet from the accretion disk around the compact object ; ( c ) along the shock structure created in collisions of stellar winds .      in this case",
    "leptons can be directly accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere or at the shock ( in classical shock acceleration scenario ) which appears as a result of collision between the pulsar and stellar winds ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "if the pulsar and stellar winds and spherical then the shock structure is axially symmetric and easy to consider .",
    "however , in the case of the be type stars , the winds are composed of two parts : the equatorial low velocity but dense wind and the polar fast and rare wind .",
    "then , the shock can reach very complicated structure with some parts very close to the massive star ( see fig  2 ) . in this last case , which we consider for the binary psr 1259 - 63/ss2883 ( bednarek & sierpowska  2008 )",
    ", leptons can be injected into the binary system even at a few stellar radii in spite of the periastron passage of the pulsar at the distance of @xmath16 from the star .      the cascade @xmath0-ray spectra and light curves in the case of the pulsar inside the spherical stellar wind has been shown for the example case of the binary system with the cyg x-3 parameters in sierpowska & bednarek  ( 2005 ) .",
    "we concluded that the distribution of the cascade @xmath0-ray spectra on the sky shows interesting structures which are determined by the dipole structure of the magnetic field of the massive star and the injection directions of primary particles .",
    "the case of the pulsar wind interacting with the non - spherical stellar wind has been discussed with the application to the be binary system psr 1259 - 63/ss2883 ( see sierpowska - bartosik & bednarek  2008 ) .",
    "we show that even in the case of this relatively extended binary system the cascade calculations should be applied for some parts of the shock structure which can even appear at the distance of a few stellar radii from the surface of the be star .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0-ray light curve close to the periastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "it has general features similar to those observed by the hess telescopes ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005a ) .",
    "the detailed studies of the spectral and time characteristics of the tev @xmath0-ray binary system ls 5039 under the assumption of the presence of energetic pulsar have been recently performed by sierpowska - bartosik & torres  ( 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "these type of objects , called microquasars , can accelerate electrons along the straight jet .",
    "the process of acceleration is not well known .",
    "modelling of such sources needs to fix various parameters which describe acceleration process such as : acceleration efficiency along the jet and along the orbit of the compact object , maximum energies of electrons , jet direction in respect to the plane of the binary .",
    "therefore , the final results are strongly model dependent . however , other parameters , such as the orbit of the binary , the massive companion , location of the observer are usually quite well known , making these systems better defined than e.g. in the case of @xmath0-ray production in agns jets .",
    "the calculations of @xmath0-ray spectra from the ic @xmath1 pair cascades initiated by primary electrons inside the jet has been done with application to three massive binary systems : ls 5039 ( bednarek  2006a ) , lsi + 61@xmath17 303 ( bednarek  2006b ) , and cyg x-1 ( bednarek & giovannelli  2007 ) .",
    "it has been shown that in general the maximum of the tev @xmath0-ray emission from these massive binaries should appear close to the phases when the compact object is in front of the massive star ( in the case of circular orbit ) .",
    "if the orbit of the compact object is very extended , than the phase of the periastron passage , in respect to the phase of the observer , can significantly change the simple pattern expected for the circular orbit .",
    "moreover , the ic @xmath1 pair cascade model for these binary systems predicts unticorrelation of the tev @xmath0-ray emission in respect to gev emission ( see also early calculations in bednarek  2000 ) .",
    "this prediction should be tested by the future observations with the lat telescope on the board of glast .",
    "particles can be also accelerated at the shock wave formed in collisions of fast winds from two massive stars in compact binary system . as an example",
    ", we discussed ( bednarek  2005 ) the most massive binary of two wr stars , wr 20a , in the open cluster westerlund 2 .",
    "however , in this case , due to extremely strong radiation field , electron acceleration is saturated by huge ic energy losses at energies which prevent tev @xmath0-ray production .",
    "therefore , we consider acceleration of nuclei to characteristic lorentz factors @xmath18 , which interacting with the matter of the stellar winds produce pions .",
    "these pions decay to @xmath19tev @xmath0-rays and leptons initiating ic @xmath1 pair cascade in the stellar radiation . in the case of wr 20a ,",
    "we were able to normalize the gev emission produced in the cascade to the flux of the egret sources observed in the direction of wr 20a . on this base ,",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray flux has been predicted on the level which should be detectable by the southern hemisphere cherenkov telescopes .",
    "in fact , the tev @xmath0-ray source has been discovered from the direction of wr 20a ( aharonian et al .",
    "2007 ) , but it does not necessarily can be linked to wr 20a due to its significant extend .",
