    "a precise theoretical framework is needed for the study of the quark mass effects in physical observables because quarks are not free particles .",
    "in fact , the quark masses should be seen more like coupling constants than like physical parameters .",
    "the perturbative pole mass and the running mass are the two most commonly used quark mass definitions .",
    "the perturbative pole mass , @xmath1 , is defined as the pole of the renormalized quark propagator in a strictly perturbative sense .",
    "it is gauge invariant and scheme independent .",
    "however , it appears to be ambiguous due to non - perturbative renormalons .",
    "the running mass , @xmath2 , the renormalized mass in the @xmath3 scheme , does not suffer from this ambiguity .",
    "both quark mass definitions can be related perturbatively through m =    can be extracted using qcd sum rules or lattice calculations from the quarkonia spectrum , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the bottom quark perturbative pole mass appears to be around @xmath4 whereas the running mass at the running mass scale reads @xmath5 . performing the running until the @xmath0-boson mass scale we find @xmath6 . since for the bottom",
    "quark the difference between the perturbative pole mass and the running mass at the @xmath7 scale is quite significant it is crucial to specify in any theoretical perturbative prediction at @xmath7 which mass should we use .    the relative uncertainty in the strong coupling constant decreases in the running from low to high energies as the ratio of the strong coupling constants at both scales . on the contrary , if we perform the quark mass running with the extreme mass and strong coupling constant values and take the maximum difference as the propagated error , induced by the strong coupling constant error , the quark mass uncertainty increases following _ r ( |m(m_z ) ) _ r ( |m ( ) ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , see figure  [ running ] .",
    "we use the world average @xcite value @xmath11 for the strong coupling constant .",
    "it is interesting to stress , looking at figure  [ running ] , that even a big uncertainty in a possible evaluation of the bottom quark mass at the @xmath7 scale can be competitive with low energy qcd sum rules and lattice calculations with smaller errors  , due to unknown higher orders in the perturbative matching of the hqet to the full theory . ] .",
    "furthermore , non - perturbative contributions are expected to be negligible at the @xmath0-boson mass scale .",
    "the running mass holds another remarkable feature .",
    "total cross sections can exhibit potentially dangerous terms of the type @xmath12 that however can be absorbed @xcite using eq .",
    "( [ relates ] ) and expressing the total result in terms of the running mass .",
    "quark masses can be neglected for many observables at lep because usually they appear as the ratio @xmath13 . for the heaviest quark produced at lep , the bottom quark ,",
    "this means a correction of 3 per mil for a quark mass of 5 ( gev ) .",
    "even if the coefficient in front is 10 we get at most a 3% effect , 1% if we use the bottom quark running mass at @xmath7 .",
    "this argument is true for total cross section .",
    "however , jet cross sections depend on a new variable , @xmath14 , the jet - resolution parameter that defines the jet multiplicity .",
    "this new variable introduces a new scale in the analysis , @xmath15 , that for small values of @xmath14 could enhance the effect of the quark mass as @xmath16 .",
    "the high precision achieved at lep makes these effects relevant .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that the biggest systematic error in the measurement of @xmath17 from @xmath18-production at lep from the ratio of three to two jets comes from the uncertainties in the estimate of the quark mass effects .",
    "we are going to study the effect of the bottom quark mass in the following ratios of three - jet decay rates and angular distributions    r_3^bd & & , [ r3bd ] + r^bd _ & & .",
    "/ , [ rtheta ] where we consider massless the @xmath19-quark and @xmath20 is the minimum of the angles formed between the gluon jet and the quark and antiquark jets .",
    "both observables are normalized to the total decay rates in order to cancel large weak corrections dependent on the top quark mass @xcite .",
    ".the jet - clustering algorithms [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     at lo in the strong coupling constant we must compute the amplitudes of the feynman diagrams depicted in figure [ feynmanlo ] plus the interchange of a virtual gluon between the quark and antiquark that only contributes to the two - jet decay rate .",
    "in addition to renormalized uv divergences , ir singularities , either collinear or soft , appear because of the presence of massless particles like gluons .",
    "bloch - nordsiek and kinoshita - lee - nauemberg theorems@xcite assure ir divergences cancel for inclusive cross section .",
    "technically this means , if we use dr to regularize the ir divergences of the loop diagrams we should express the phase space for the tree - level diagrams in arbitrary @xmath21-dimensions .",
    "the ir singularities cancel when we integrate over the full phase space .",
    "another delicate question is the problem of hadronization .",
    "perturbative qcd gives results at the level of partons , quarks and gluons , but in nature one observes hadrons , not partons , and hadronization can shift the qcd predictions .",
    "we apply to the parton amplitudes the same jet clustering algorithms applied experimentally to the real observed particles , see table  [ algorithms ] . starting from a bunch of particles of momenta @xmath22",
    "we calculate , for instance , @xmath23 , the scalar product of all the possible momenta pairs .",
    "if the minimum is smaller than a fixed @xmath14 we combine the two involved particles in a new pseudoparticle of momentum @xmath24 .",
    "the procedure starts again until all the @xmath25 are bigger than @xmath14 .",
    "the number of pseudoparticles at the end of the procedure defines the number of jets .",
    "the jet clustering algorithms automatically define ir finite quantities . for the moment",
    ", we do not enter in the question of which is the best jet clustering algorithm although the main criteria followed to choose one of them should be based in two requirements : minimization of higher order corrections and insensitivity to hadronization .",
    "if we restrict to the three - jet decay rate the ir problem can be overcome and everything can be calculated in four dimensions because the jet clustering algorithms automatically exclude the ir region from the three - body phase space .    for massless particles and at the lowest order",
    "the em  @xcite , jade and e algorithms give the same answers .",
    "analytical results for the massless three - jet fraction exist for both jade - like  @xcite and durham  @xcite algorithms .",
    "a complete analysis for the ratios of three - jet decay rates and the angular distributions quoted in eq .  [ r3bd ] and [ rtheta ] can be found in @xcite . for practical purposes a parametrization of the result in terms of a power series in @xmath26 gives a good description @xcite .",
    "the effect of the bottom quark mass has been studied experimentally by  @xcite on the @xmath27 ratio . as we have seen",
    "the running of the bottom quark mass from low energies to the @xmath7 scale is quite strong .",
    "the lo qcd prediction for @xmath27 does not allow us to distinguish which mass we should use in the theoretical expressions , either the pole mass or the running mass at some scale .",
    "the computation of the nlo is mandatory if we want to extract information about the bottom quark mass from lep data .    at the nlo we have to calculate the interference of the loop diagrams depicted in figure  [ feynmannlo ] with the lowest order feynman diagrams of figure  [ feynmanlo ] plus the square of the tree - level diagrams of figure  [ feynmannlo ] .",
    "the amplitudes in the massless case were calculated by  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the jet clustering algorithms was performed by  @xcite .",
    "the main problem that now we can not avoid is the appearance of ir singularities . with massive quarks we loose all the quark - gluon collinear divergences .",
    "the amplitudes behave better in the ir region .",
    "the disadvantage however is the mass itself .",
    "we have to perform quite more complicated loop and phase space integrals .",
    "furthermore , we still conserve the gluon - gluon collinear divergences leading to ir double poles .",
    "the three - jet decay rate can be written as ^b_3j = c [ g_v^2 h_v(y_c , r_b ) + g_a^2 h_a(y_c , r_b ) ] , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a normalization constant that disappear in the ratio and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the vector and the axial - vector neutral current quark couplings . at tree - level and for the bottom quark @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "now we can expand the functions @xmath34 in @xmath35 and factorize the leading dependence on the quark mass as follows h_v(a ) & = & a^(0)(y_c ) + r_b b_v(a)^(0)(y_c , r_b ) + & + & ( a^(1)(y_c ) + r_b b_v(a)^(1)(y_c , r_b ) ) , where we have taken into account that for massless quarks vector and axial contributions are identical triangle anomaly @xcite . with our choice of the normalization @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are defined in @xcite . ] .",
    "first steep in the calculation is to show the cancellation of the ir divergences in order to build matrix elements free of singularities .",
    "it is possible to do it analytically .",
    "however , we knew from the beginning ir divergences should disappear @xcite .",
    "the challenge is in the calculation of the finite parts .",
    "this calculation is rather long , complex and full of difficulties .",
    "strong cancellations occur between different groups of diagrams making difficult even a numerical approach .",
    "we have taken as guide line the massless result of @xcite although the ir structure of the massive case is completely different from the massless one .    in figures",
    "[ jtest ] and [ etest ] we present our preliminary result for the vectorial contribution to the @xmath40 three - jet decay rate of the z - boson into bottom quarks .",
    "we have performed the calculation for different values of the bottom quark mass from @xmath41 to @xmath42 for fixed @xmath14 .",
    "we want to show we can recover the massless result @xcite , depicted as a big circle , i.e. , in the limit of massless quarks we reach the @xmath43 function .",
    "this is our main test to have confidence in our calculation .    in the jade algorithm",
    "we can see that for big values of @xmath14 the nlo corrections due to the quark mass are very small and below the massless result .",
    "notice they increase quite a lot for small values of @xmath14 and give a positive correction that will produce a change in the slope of the lo prediction for @xmath27 . in any case we recover the massless limit and a linear parametrization in the quark mass squared could provide a good description .",
    "the e algorithm behaves also linearly in the quark mass squared although only for big values of @xmath14 .",
    "corrections in the e algorithm are always very strong .",
    "the reason is the following , the resolution parameter for the e algorithm explicitly incorporates the quark mass , @xmath44 , i.e. , for the same value of @xmath14 we are closer to the two - jet ir region and the difference from the other algorithms is precisely the quark mass .",
    "this phenomenon already manifest at the lo .",
    "the behaviour of the e algorithm is completely different from the others for massive quarks .",
    "it is difficult to believe in the e algorithm as a good prescription for physical applications since mass corrections as so big .",
    "however for the same reason , it seems to be the best one for testing massive calculations .",
    "we have presented the first results for the nlo strong corrections to the three - jet decay rate of the z - boson into massive quarks . in particular , extrapolating our result we have shown we can recover previous calculations with massless quarks .",
    "their application to lep data , together with the already known lo , can provide a new way for determining the bottom quark mass and to show for the first time its running .",
    "* acknowledgements .",
