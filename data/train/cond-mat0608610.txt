    "the quantum critical scaling is different from the critical scattering from classical af second order phase transition as the former is controlled by @xmath80 itself while the characteristic energy scale @xmath181 in the latter case is determined by reduced temperature @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) @xcite . for the heisenberg antiferromagnet with @xmath164",
    "k , @xmath181 should fall within the quasi - elastic part of the energy spectra and thus not contribute to the observed magnetic scattering in fig .",
    "5 . by plotting all data above the 30 k energy scale ( @xmath184 mev ) as a function of @xmath173 and minimizing @xmath185 ( ref .",
    "38 ) , we find @xmath186 independent of the functional form of @xmath180 ( fig .",

    "we fit the latter using @xmath188 and find @xmath189 .",
    "this collapse of the data over more than two decades of @xmath173 strongly suggests the presence of universal dynamics .",
    "if these universal dynamics indeed reflect a nearby qcp , the scaling behavior must break down at low energies and temperatures , with the cut - off scale determined by the distance to the qcp .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath190 the @xmath173 scaling is observed only at temperatures above about 30 k ( fig .",
    "the fact that this temperature scale is of the order of @xmath24 suggests that the cut - off to scaling is connected with the development of the af order . likewise , at the lowest measured temperature , @xmath89 k , the @xmath173 scaling is seen only at @xmath191 above about 2 mev ( fig .",
    "9b ) , which , within the error bars , is equal to the low-@xmath190 cut - off temperature multiplied by the universal constant @xmath192 .",
    "now turning to how this scaling regime evolves in samples tuned closer to optimal doping , the same type of scaling analysis can be performed for the low - energy magnetic spectra of the @xmath13 k plcco . since our neutron diffraction measurements at @xmath130 show a @xmath193 k ( fig .",
    "2c ) , this sample should be much closer to the magnetic qcp than the @xmath28 k ( @xmath164 k ) plcco .",

    "7c - e ) . besides the overall scale factor",
    ", we find that all data with @xmath196 mev and/or @xmath197 k fall on the universal curve , consistent with the @xmath13 k plcco being closer to the qcp point .",
    "the @xmath173 scaling regime is seemingly correlated with the gradual suppression of the af order as optimal superconductivity is approached , indicating the presence of a magnetic quantum critical point in electron - doped superconductors . however , the dynamic in - plane spin correlation length as stated earlier is observed to decrease with increasing @xmath4 and decreasing @xmath32 , suggesting that this qcp in plcco can not arise from criticality towards a three - dimensional long - range af order at 0 k @xcite . instead , the data are similar to what happens in the li - doped la@xmath6cuo@xmath83 @xcite and in certain spin - glass qcp heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "although there is at present no comprehensive theory for the expected properties of a metallic spin - glass qcp , the reduced magnetic transition temperature and the continuous nature of the transition ( fig .",
    "2c ) imply that the scaling behavior in the @xmath13 k plcco should persist down to lower energies and temperatures than that of the @xmath28 k sample .    continuing this analysis on the magnetic fluctuations observed in the @xmath10 k sample , an identical scaling plot is shown in fig .",
    "a constant scale factor was again used to normalize the scaling fit from the @xmath28 k sample to overlay with the data from the @xmath10 k sample .",
    "as the system is tuned closer to the qcp , there should now be larger ranges of energies and temperatures @xmath128 in which the scaling remains valid . indeed",
    ", now all energies and temperatures ( for which a suitable nonmagnetic background was measured ) are shown to collapse on the same universal curve determined for the @xmath28 k sample ( dashed line in fig .",
    "this encompasses the entire range of energy and temperature probed from @xmath198 mev and @xmath199 k with the exception of a notable divergence at the @xmath84 mev spin fluctuations measured at @xmath50 k in fig .",
    "this divergence from the scaling fit for spin dynamics with @xmath200 mev may result from the system being tuned slightly beyond the qcp . in this case , the low energy / temperature spin dynamics crossover into the quantum disordered regime and no longer obey the scaling relation of quatum critical excitations . since the system does not exhibit af order to at least 600 mk",
    ", we can not determine how close the sample is to the @xmath201 k qcp .",
    "nevertheless , the overall trend for the three superconducting plcco investigated is that of increasing regimes of validity for the dynamic @xmath173 scaling as the system is tuned closer to the qcp itself .",
    "finally , the valid scaling regimes for all three sc plcco samples are overplotted in fig .",
    "10c showing a universal collapse onto a common function , with the exception of the lowest energy excitations at @xmath50 k for the @xmath10 k sample as discussed earlier . the universal collapse signifying @xmath173 scaling and the systematic evolution of scaling regime as af order",

    "recent transport and optical measurements on electron - doped pr@xmath17ce@xmath202cuo@xmath203 ( pcco ) have identified singular behaviors , which appear compatible with the influence of a qcp @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that such a qcp may have a magnetic origin , possibly due to the presence of a spin - glass qcp .",
    "we note that previous work has shown the presence of a spin - glass qcp in the hole - doped cuprates @xcite , thus suggesting that this magnetic qcp might be a common feature in high-@xmath4 superconductors regardless of doped - carrier type .",
    "we have systematically measured the doping evolution of the low energy spin fluctuations in the electron - doped cuprate , plcco , as the system is tuned from an as - grown nsc antiferromagnet into a phase - pure optimally doped superconductor .",
    "the as - grown , semiconducting plcco system exhibits gapped low energy spin fluctuations consistent with those observed in the parent compound pr@xmath6cuo@xmath83 . tuning the system into an optimally doped superconductor changes these low energy spin excitations dramatically . instead of a gapped spin wave spectrum , the superconducting plcco samples exhibit gapless low energy spin dynamics which exhibit two differing regimes of response in @xmath128 : the first of these coupling to the onset of the af order in the system and the second appearing as spin dynamics whose scattering is weakly temperature dependent over large temperature ranges .",
    "the regime that couples to the af order in these samples is seen to evolve from @xmath204 k and @xmath205 mev in the @xmath28 k sample to @xmath206 k and @xmath207 mev in the @xmath13 k plcco . at optimal doping ( @xmath10 k ) , where the static af phase is suppressed to below 600 mk , the observed magnetic scattering for @xmath208 k or @xmath209 mev is @xmath80-independent , suggestive of the possible influence of quantum critical fluctuations in the system .",
    "subsequent scaling analysis of the data revealed a collapse of appropriate regions of @xmath128 onto a universal curve for all three superconducting plcco systems studied , thereby providing microscopic evidence for a qcp in the electron doped plcco .",
    "additionally , the first system discussed , @xmath28 k plcco , displays a peak in the low-@xmath80 susceptibility centered at @xmath210 mev which vanishes upon warming , whereas systems tuned closer to optimal doping ( @xmath13 k and @xmath10 k ) display only continuously decreasing magnetic response with increasing energy transfer .",
    "our experiments described here have provided a systematic investigation into the evolution of the low energy spin dynamics in an electron - doped copper oxide , plcco , thereby providing valuable constraints on microscopic theories seeking to model the spin excitations as the materials evolve from a long - range ordered antiferromagnet into an optimally doped superconductor .",
