    "kaluza - klein ( kk ) compactification @xcite in its original sense is the procedure by which one unifies the pure 4-dimensional ( 4-d ) gravity with gauge theories through the dimensional reduction of the higher dimensional pure gravity theories .",
    "the basic idea is that the isometry symmetry of the internal space manifests itself as the gauge symmetry in 4-d after the compactification of the extra space .",
    "in addition to gauge fields , associated with the isometry group , the scalar fields , corresponding to the degrees of freedom of the internal metric , arise upon compactification .",
    "a class of interesting solutions for such an effective 4-d kk theory constitutes configurations with a non - trivial 4-d space - time dependence for the additional scalar fields , gauge fields , as well as for the 4-d space - time metric .",
    "in particular , spherically symmetric charged configurations correspond to charged black hole ( bh ) solutions with additional scalar fields varying with the spatial radial coordinate .",
    "we shall refer to such configurations as kk bh s .",
    "examples of kk bh s in 5-d @xcite kk theories with abelian isometry have been studied in the past .",
    "dobiasch and maison @xcite developed a formalism by which one can generate the most general stationary , spherically symmetric solutions in abelian kk theories .",
    "their formalism was applied primarily to obtain the explicit solutions for the bh s in 5-d kk theory , only .    among a class of non - trivial configurations , those which saturate the bogomolnyi bound on their energy ( adm mass @xcite ) can be viewed as non - trivial vacuum configurations  solitons  and are thus of special interest . when embedded in supersymmetric theories",
    "such configurations correspond to bosonic configurations which are invariant under ( constrained ) supersymmetry transformations , _",
    "i.e. _ , they satisfy the corresponding killing spinor equations .",
    "one refers to such configurations as supersymmetric ones .",
    "supersymmetric kk bh s in 5-d kk theory were first discussed by gibbons and perry @xcite .",
    "their result was recently generalized @xcite to supersymmetric kk bh s in @xmath7-d abelian kk theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , those with the @xmath8 internal isometry group . with a diagonal internal metric ,",
    "such solutions exist if and only if the isometry group of the internal space is broken down to the @xmath9 group .",
    "the aim of this paper is to address static 4-d charged bh solutions , compatible with the corresponding bogomolnyi bound , in @xmath7-d kk theory with abelian isometry group @xmath8 .",
    "explicit solutions with diagonal internal metric turn out to correspond to configurations with at most one electric and one magnetic charges , which can either come from the same @xmath3-gauge field ( corresponding to dyonic bh s in effective 5-d kk theory ) or from different ones ( corresponding to bh s with the @xmath9 isometry in an effective 6-d kk theory ) .",
    "their global space - time and thermal properties are explored . a class of abelian kk bh solutions with constrained charge configurations is further obtained by performing global @xmath6 transformations on the above solutions .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we discuss dimensional reduction of the @xmath7-d gravity . in section",
    "iii we derive the constraints on charges for charged kk bh s with the diagonal internal metric ansatz . in section iv we discuss the explicit form of the non - extreme @xmath9 solutions , their global space - time structure and thermal properties . in section",
    "v we discuss the electric - magnetic duality of a more general class of the solutions generated by global @xmath6 rotations on the internal metric .",
    "conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "the starting point is the pure einstein - poincar ' e gravity in @xmath7-d : @xmath10 where the ricci scalar @xmath11 and the determinant @xmath12 are defined in terms of a @xmath7-d metric @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the @xmath7-d gravitational constant . for the notation of space - time indices",
    ", we shall follow the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ , the upper- ( or lower- ) case letters are for those running over @xmath7-d ( or 4-d ) space - time . those with tilde are reserved for the @xmath15 extra spatial dimensions .",
    "latin ( or greek ) letters denote flat ( or curved ) indices .",
    "we shall use the mostly positive signature convention @xmath16 for the @xmath7-d metric .",
    "the dimensional reduction of the higher dimensional gravity is achieved by splitting the @xmath7-d metric @xmath13 into the following form : @xmath17\\ \\ , \\label{ansatz}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the unimodular part , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath19 , of the internal metric , @xmath20 is the determinant of the internal metric , which we will refer to as dilaton , and @xmath21 .    the effective theory in 4-d",
    "is then obtained by imposing `` the right invariance '' @xcite of the @xmath7-d metric @xmath22 under the action of an isometry of the internal space .",
    "this requirement fixes the dependence of the metric components on the internal coordinates .",
    "it turns out that the internal coordinate dependence of the transformation laws ( under the general coordinate transformations ) of the fields in ( [ ansatz ] ) factors out , and @xmath7-d einstein lagrangian density ( [ highlag ] ) becomes independent of the internal coordinates .",
    "then , 4-d effective action after a trivial integration over the internal space assumes the form ( see for example eq.(8 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath23\\ \\ , \\label{efflag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ricci scalar @xmath24 is defined in terms of the unimodular part @xmath25 @xmath26 of the internal metric , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the structure constant for the internal isometry group and @xmath29 is the gauge coupling constant of the isometry group , is the field strength of the gauge field @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the corresponding gauge covariant derivative and @xmath32 is the lagrangian multiplier .",
    "the 4-d gravitational constant @xmath33 has been set equal to 1 . when the isometry group is abelian , _",
    "i.e. _ , one compactifies on @xmath15-torus @xmath34 , the structure constant @xmath28 vanishes . in this case , the gauge covariant derivatives in ( [ efflag ] ) become ordinary ones and the ricci scalar @xmath24 , which in general describes the self - interactions among scalar fields , vanishes .",
    "we shall first address the spherically symmetric configurations with the diagonal internal metric ansatz . then , the unimodular part of the internal metric is of the form : @xmath35 the spherically symmetric _ ansatz _ for the 4-d space - time metric is of the form : @xmath36 and the scalar fields @xmath20 and @xmath37 depend on the radial coordinate @xmath38 , only .",
    "the electromagnetic vector potentials take the form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are the constant values of the corresponding scalar fields at @xmath47 . ]",
    "the _ ansatz _ with all the off - diagonal components of the internal metric turned off has to be consistent with the equations of motion .",
    "in fact , such a consistency restricts the allowed charge configurations .",
    "namely , the euler - lagrange equations for the components @xmath25 of the unimodular part of the metric is given by : @xmath48 + \\chi r(r)\\rho^{ij}(r ) = { 1 \\over 2}{{\\rm d } \\over { { \\rm d}r } } [ \\lambda(r)r(r){{{\\rm d}\\rho^{ij}(r)}\\over { { \\rm d}r } } ] \\ \\ , \\label{rhoij}\\ ] ] which implies that for the diagonal metric _",
    "ansatz _ ( [ diag ] )",
    "the following constraints have to be satisfied : @xmath49 eqs .",
    "( [ ij ] ) can be satisfied if and only if with @xmath50 being constant would imply the equation of motion for @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the constraint @xmath53 in turn reduces to the subset of constraints ( [ chcon ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath54 constraints ( [ chcon ] ) imply that the same type of charge , _",
    "i.e. _ , either electric or magnetic one , can appear in at most one gauge field .",
    "consequently , the internal isometry group @xmath8 is broken down to at most @xmath55 , with one electric and one magnetic charges , only .",
    "when , say , the first ( @xmath56 ) gauge fields are turned off the first ( @xmath56 ) components of the diagonal internal metric become constant ( @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) ) .",
    "thus , the kk bh s are those of effective 6-d kk : @xmath59\\ \\ , \\label{effec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 $ ] @xmath62 with the constraint @xmath63 .    in general",
    ", one can , therefore , have the following qualitatively different classes of configurations :    * @xmath64 , which corresponds to the ordinary 4-d schwarzschild bh s . * say , @xmath65 , which corresponds to kk bh s in effective 5-d kk theory . * say , @xmath66 , which corresponds to a class of kk bh s in effective 6-d kk theory , where electric and magnetic charges arise from different @xmath3 groups .    schwarzschild",
    "bh s are well understood , and bh s in 5-d kk theory have been extensively studied in refs .",
    "we , therefore , concentrate on the study of the last class of solutions , which correspond to the non - extremal generalization of @xmath67 supersymmetric solution , studied in ref .",
    "if only a pair of gauge fields are non - zero , the lagrangian density ( [ efflag ] ) becomes that of effective 6-d kk theory @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", one assumes that the first [ second ] gauge field to be magnetic [ electric ] .",
    "the einstein s and euler - lagrange equations can be cast in following form : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath38 .",

    "these are supersymmetric solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , we shall discuss the global space - time structure and thermal properties of the solution .",
    "we first describe the singularity structure of 4-d space - time defined by the metric coefficients ( [ asol ] ) and ( [ bsol ] ) . for the non - extreme solutions ,",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath79 , there is a space - like singularity at @xmath99 which is hidden behind a horizon at @xmath100 .",

    "the hawking temperature  citehaw , which can be calculated by identifying the inverse of the imaginary time period @xcite of a functional path integral , turns out to be @xmath102 . with the explicit solution ( [ asol ] ) for @xmath103",
    "one obtains : @xmath104^{1\\over 2 } [ \\beta + ( { \\bf",

    "when either @xmath84 or @xmath83 becomes zero @xmath106 is infinite .",

    "the entropy becomes zero .",
    "in addition to the 4-d general coordinate invariance and gauge symmetry , which arise from the @xmath7-d general coordinate invariance of the @xmath7-d einstein action ( [ highlag ] ) , the lagrangian density ( [ efflag ] ) has a global @xmath6 invariance : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is an @xmath6 rotation matrix .",

    "the two types of solutions are obtained by performing the @xmath6 transformation on bh solutions of the effective 5-d and 6-d kk theories , respectively . since",
    "the 4-d space - time metric and the dilaton field are not affected by the @xmath6 transformations , the global space - time and the thermal properties in each class of the solutions remain the same .",
    "the above transformations also generate non - diagonal internal metric coefficients ; the @xmath120 degrees of freedom associated with the rotational angles of the @xmath6 matrix generate the @xmath121 off - diagonal internal metric components .    on the other hand",
    ", the two classes of the solutions correspond to kk bh s with constrained charge configurations , and therefore do not constitute the most general set of static 4-d abelian kk bh s solutions .",
    "namely , the subset of rotational matrices , which transform the charge configuration of the @xmath4 solution to a new type of charge configurations , corresponds to the coset space @xmath122 .",
    "this subset of transformations therefore provides @xmath123 additional degrees of freedom for the ( electric and magnetic ) charge configuration .",

    "in fact , @xmath125 ( @xmath15-electric and @xmath15-magnetic ) charges @xmath126 satisfy the constraint @xmath127 .",
    "similarly , for solutions generated by the @xmath128-transformations on the charge configuration of the effective 5-d kk solution , the resultant number of charge degrees of freedom is @xmath129 .    in the following",
    "we shall concentrate on the electric - magnetic duality of solutions generated by @xmath6 transformations on bh s of the effective 6-d kk theory , since they involve less trivial transformations than those acting on bh s of the effective 5-d kk theory .",
    "the unimodular part of the internal metric and the set of @xmath15 gauge fields transform in the following way : @xmath130 where the electric and magnetic charges of new gauge field @xmath131 are , therefore , given by @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) . the expression for 4-d metric components in the new configuration",
    "can be obtained from ( [ asol ] ) - ( [ bsol ] ) by replacing @xmath135 and @xmath2 by @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",

    "in particular , the discrete change of the rotation angle @xmath147 from 0 to @xmath148 corresponds to a discrete electric - magnetic duality transformation , which interchanges the magnetic and electric monopole charges in the @xmath145-@xmath146 and @xmath15-@xmath146 gauge fields @xcite .",
