    "the correlation function of deuteron pairs with high total momenta is thus sensitive to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .     for two - triton correlation function with and without momentum cut . ]     for two-@xmath0he correlation function with and without momentum cut . ]    in figs .",
    "[ cortri ] and [ corhe3 ] , we show , respectively , the two - triton and two-@xmath0he correlation functions with and without momentum cut .",
    "since the strong interaction potential between two tritons or @xmath0he is poorly known , the results obtained here include only the coulomb potential in the final - state interaction as in ref .",
    "it is seen that the stiff symmetry energy leads to a slightly stronger anti - correlation of triton or @xmath0he pairs than that obtained with the soft symmetry energy , particularly for triton or @xmath0he pairs with total momenta @xmath100 .",
    "the symmetry energy effect on heavier clusters is thus weaker than on lighter particles such as nucleons and deuterons , and this is consistent with the fact that the symmetry energy effect on cluster emission times becomes weaker with increasing particle mass as shown in fig .",
    "[ emtimee ] .",
    "using an isospin - dependent transport model , we have studied light cluster production via the coalescence model in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we find that the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy affects significantly the yield of deuterons , tritons , and @xmath5he in these collisions .",
    "more light clusters are produced for the stiff symmetry energy than the soft symmetry energy .",
    "this effect is particularly large when these clusters have lower kinetic energies .",
    "also , the isobaric ratio t/@xmath0he , especially for higher energy tritons and @xmath0he , shows a strong sensitivity to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "it is further found that light cluster production is insensitive to the of the isospin - independent part of nuclear equation of state and the medium dependence of nucleon - nucleon cross sections .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of light cluster production on the impact parameter and incident energy of heavy ion collisions as well as the mass of the reaction system .",
    "we find that the symmetry energy effect on light cluster production depends weakly on impact parameter and the mass of the reaction system .",
    "however , with increasing incident energy the symmetry energy effect on light cluster production becomes weaker .",
    "we have further studied the emission time and sequence as well as the correlation functions of light clusters .",
    "it is found that at same momentum per nucleon heavier clusters are emitted earlier than lighter ones as expected from the coalescence model . since the emission time of light clusters is earlier for the stiff symmetry energy than for the soft one , a stronger anti - correlation of light clusters",
    "is obtained with the stiff symmetry energy .",
    "however , the symmetry energy effect on the correlation functions of light clusters becomes weaker with increasing cluster mass .",
    "isospin effects on cluster production and isotopic ratios in heavy ion collisions have been previously studied using either the lattice gas model @xcite or a hybrid of and statistical fragmentation model @xcite .",
    "these studies are , however , at lower energies than considered here , where effects due to multifragmentation as a result of possible gas - liquid phase transition may play an important role . except deuterons , both tritons and @xmath0he",
    "are only about one per event in heavy ion collisions at @xmath78 .",
    "the number of other clusters such as the alpha particle is not large either @xcite . in this case",
    ", the coalescence model is expected to be a reasonable model for determining the production of light clusters from heavy ion collisions as demonstrated in section [ ibuu ] .",
    "this is particularly so for light clusters with large kinetic energies as they are not contaminated by contributions from decays of heavy fragments , which are mainly of low kinetic energies and may not be negligible in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "furthermore , the effect obtained in present study will be enhanced if other clusters are emitted earlier during the collisions , leading to a larger isospin asymmetry in the remaining emission source for light clusters .",
    "studies of light clusters production and correlations in heavy ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei thus provide another possible tool for extracting useful information about the density - dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "in the present work , we have not included momentum dependence in either the isoscalar mean - field potential or the symmetry potential .",
    "the former may affect the properties of nuclear emission source as it has been shown that a momentum - dependent mean - field potential reduces nuclear stopping or increases nuclear transparency @xcite . with momentum dependence included in the nuclear symmetry potential ,",
    "differences between the neutron and proton potentials are affected not only by the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy but also by the magnitude of proton and neutron momenta @xcite . since",
    "the momentum - dependent symmetry potential has been shown to reduce significantly the n / p ratio at higher kinetic energies @xcite , it is expected to also affect our results on the kinetic energy dependence of t/@xmath5he ratio .",
    "it is thus of interest to study quantitatively how the results obtained in the present study are modified by the momentum dependence of nuclear mean - field potentials .",
