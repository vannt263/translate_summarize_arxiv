    "lep operated at centre - of - mass energies around 91.2   from 1989 to 1995 and then moved up to six different centre - of - mass energies between 130  and 189   in the following three years .",
    "thus a study of the process @xmath6 @xmath7 hadrons at lep offers a unique environment to test the predictions of the theory of the strong interaction ( qcd ) over a wide energy range .",
    "the energy range has been extended by using hadronic events from z decays with isolated high energy photons in order to probe the structure of hadronic events at reduced centre - of - mass energies down to 30 gev @xcite .",
    "the high energy photons are radiated early in the process through initial state radiation ( isr ) or through quark bremsstrahlung whereas the hadronic shower develops over a longer time scale .",
    "we report here measurements of event shape distributions and their moments using the data collected with the l3 detector  @xcite .",
    "we update the published results at @xmath8 = 161 , 172 and 183   @xcite with an improved selection method for hadronic events and present new results at @xmath8 = 130 , 136 and 189 .",
    "the measured distributions are compared with predictions from event generators based on an improved leading log approximation ( parton shower models including qcd coherence effects ) .",
    "three such monte carlo programs ( jetset ps  @xcite , herwig @xcite and ariadne @xcite ) have been used for these comparisons .",
    "we also compare our measurements with predictions from qcd models with no coherence effects ( cojets @xcite ) .",
    "these monte carlo programs use different approaches to describe both the perturbative parton shower evolution and non - perturbative hadronisation processes .",
    "they have been tuned to reproduce the global event shape distributions and the charged particle multiplicity distribution measured at 91.2  @xcite .",
    "the moments of event shape variables are measured between 30  and 189 .",
    "the perturbative and non - perturbative qcd contributions are obtained from a fit using the power correction formula  @xcite .",
    "this approach was first applied by the delphi collaboration @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath4 is also determined at each of these centre - of - mass energies by comparing the measured event shape distributions with predictions of second order qcd calculations @xcite containing resummed leading and next - to - leading order terms @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : sel ] describes the selection of hadronic events .",
    "measurements of event shape variables and estimation of systematic errors are described in section [ sec : evshap ] .",
    "section [ sec : als ] presents a comparison of the data with predictions from various qcd models , a study of the power correction ansatz and a determination of @xmath4 from event shape distributions .",
    "the results are summarised in section  [ sec : summ ] .",
    "the selection of @xmath6 @xmath7 hadrons events is based on the energy measured in the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters .",
    "we use energy clusters in the calorimeters with a minimum energy of 100 .",
    "we measure the total visible energy ( @xmath9 ) and the energy imbalances parallel ( @xmath10 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath11 ) to the beam direction .",
    "backgrounds are different for hadronic z decays , hadronic events at reduced centre - of - mass energies and at high energies .",
    "this is reflected in the different selection cuts used for these three types of data sets .",
    "we use monte carlo events to estimate the efficiency of the selection criteria and purity of the data sample .",
    "monte carlo events for the process @xmath12 have been generated by the parton shower programs jetset and pythia @xcite and passed through the l3 detector simulation  @xcite .",
    "the background events are simulated with appropriate event generators : pythia and phojet @xcite for two - photon events , koralz @xcite for the @xmath13 final state , bhagene @xcite and bhwide @xcite for bhabha events , koralw @xcite for w - pair production and pythia for z - pair production .",
    "details of event selection at @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15 and at reduced centre - of - mass energies have been described earlier @xcite . at @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15",
    ", we have used only a small subset of the complete data sample ( 8.3 @xmath16 out of 142.4 @xmath16 of integrated luminosity ) which still provides an experimental error three times smaller than theoretical uncertainties .",
    "data at @xmath8 = 130 and 136   were collected in two separate runs during 1995 @xcite and 1997 .",
    "the main background at these energies comes from isr resulting in a mass of the hadronic system close to @xmath15 .",
    "this background is reduced by applying a cut in the two dimensional plane of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the current analysis , data sets from the two years have been combined and the cuts are optimised to get the best efficiency times purity .    for the data at @xmath8 @xmath19 161 ,",
    "additional backgrounds arise from w - pair and z - pair production . a substantial fraction",
    "( @xmath20 80% ) of these events can be removed by a specific selection @xcite based on :    * forcing the event to a 4-jet topology using the durham algorithm @xcite , * performing a kinematic fit imposing the constraints of energy - momentum conservation , * making cuts on energies of the most and the least energetic jets and on @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the jet resolution parameter for which the event is classified as a three - jet rather than a four - jet event .",
    "these cuts have also been optimised at each energy point . for centre - of - mass energies at or above 130 , hadronic events with isr photon energy larger than 0.18@xmath8",
    "are considered as background .",
    "the integrated luminosity , selection efficiency , purity and number of selected events for each of the energy points are summarised in table [ tab : events ] .",
    "we measure five global event shape variables for which improved analytical qcd calculations @xcite are available .",
    "these are thrust ( @xmath22 ) , scaled heavy jet mass ( @xmath23 ) , total ( @xmath24 ) and wide ( @xmath25 ) jet broadening variables and the @xmath26-parameter .    for monte carlo events ,",
    "the global event shape variables are calculated before ( particle level ) and after ( detector level ) detector simulation .",
    "the calculation before detector simulation takes into account all stable charged and neutral particles .",
    "the measured distributions at detector level differ from the ones at particle level because of detector effects , limited acceptance and resolution . after subtracting the background obtained from simulations ,",
    "the measured distributions for all energies except @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15 are corrected for detector effects , acceptance and resolution on a bin - by - bin basis by comparing the detector level results with the particle level results .",
    "the level of migration is kept at a negligible level with a bin size larger than the experimental resolution . at @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15 ,",
    "the detector effects are unfolded for these event shape variables using a regularised unfolding method @xcite .",
    "we also correct the data for initial and final state photon radiation bin - by - bin using monte carlo distributions at particle level with and without radiation .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the distributions of event shape variables arise mainly due to uncertainties in the estimation of detector correction and background estimation .",
    "the uncertainty in the detector correction has been estimated by several independent checks :    * the definition of reconstructed objects used to calculate the observables has been changed . instead of using only calorimetric clusters ,",
    "the analysis has been repeated with objects obtained from a non - linear combination of energies of charged tracks and calorimetric clusters . at @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15",
    ", we use a track based selection and the event shape variables are constructed from the tracks . *",
    "the effect of different particle densities in correcting the measured distribution has been estimated by changing the signal monte carlo program ( herwig instead of jetset ) . *",
    "the acceptance has been reduced by restricting the events to the central part of the detector ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the polar angle of the thrust axis relative to the beam direction ) where the energy resolution is better .",
    "the uncertainty on the background composition of the selected event sample has been estimated differently for the three types of data sets . at @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15 ,",
    "the background contamination is negligible and the uncertainty due to that has been neglected . for data samples at reduced centre - of - mass energies ,",
    "the systematic errors arising from background subtraction have been estimated @xcite by :    * varying , by one standard deviation , the background scale factor which takes into account the lack of isolated @xmath29 and @xmath30 production in the monte carlo sample , * varying the cuts on neural network probability , jet and local isolation angles , and energy in the local isolation cone .    at high energies ,",
    "the uncertainty is determined by repeating the analysis with :    * an alternative criterion to reject the hard initial state photon events based on a cut on the kinematically reconstructed effective centre - of - mass energy , * a variation of the estimated two - photon interaction background by @xmath1 30% and by changing the background monte carlo program ( phojet instead of pythia ) , and * a variation of the @xmath31 background estimate by changing the w - pair rejection criteria .",
    "the systematic uncertainties obtained from different sources are combined in quadrature . at high energies , uncertainties due to isr and @xmath31 backgrounds are the most important ones .",
    "they are roughly equal and are 2 - 3 times larger than the uncertainties due to the detector correction .    apart from the data set at @xmath8 @xmath14 @xmath15 , statistical fluctuations are not negligible in the estimation of systematic effects .",
    "the statistical component of the systematic uncertainty is determined by splitting the overall monte carlo sample into luminosity weighted sub - samples and treating each of these sub - samples as data .",
    "the spread in the mean position gives an estimate of the statistical component and is taken out from the original estimate in quadrature .",
    "figure  [ fig : part ] shows the corrected distributions for thrust , scaled heavy jet mass , total and wide jet broadening and the @xmath26-parameter obtained at @xmath8 = 189 .",
    "the data are compared with predictions from qcd models jetset ps , herwig and ariadne at particle level .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "an important test of qcd models is a comparison of the energy evolution of the event shape variables .",
    "the energy dependence of the mean event shape variables arises mainly from two sources : the logarithmic energy scale dependence of @xmath4 and the power law behaviour of non - perturbative effects .",
    "the first moments of the five event shape variables are shown in figure  [ fig : evol ] and table [ tab : fmom ] .",
    "also shown are the energy dependences of these quantities as predicted by jetset ps , herwig , ariadne , cojets and jetset me ( @xmath2(@xmath32 ) matrix element implementation ) .",
    "all the models with the possible exception of jetset me give a good description of the data .",
    "the energy dependence of moments of the event shape variables has been described @xcite as a sum of the perturbative contributions and a power law dependence due to non - perturbative contributions .",
    "the first moment of an event shape variable @xmath33 is written as @xmath34 where the perturbative contribution @xmath35 has been determined to @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the power correction term @xcite , for @xmath36 , @xmath23 , and @xmath26 , is given by @xmath37 where the factor @xmath38 depends on the shape variable @xmath33 and @xmath39 is supposed to have a universal form : @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a renormalisation scale fixed at @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is related to the value of @xmath4 in the non - perturbative region below an infrared matching scale @xmath41 (= 2 ) ; @xmath42 is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of colours and @xmath45 is the number of active flavours .",
    "@xmath46 = ( 67/18 @xmath47 @xmath48/6)@xmath49 @xmath47 @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath49 are the usual colour factors .",
    "the milan factor @xmath52 is 1.49 for @xmath45 = 3 . for the jet broadening variables ,",
    "the power correction term takes the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 takes a value 1 for @xmath24 and 2 for @xmath25 and @xmath56 is related to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we have carried out fits to the first moments of the five event shape variables separately with @xmath5 and @xmath0 as free parameters .",
    "the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix between the different energy points are constructed by summing in quadrature the systematic uncertainty and the statistical error .",
    "the off - diagonal terms are obtained from the common systematic errors .",
    "the results of the fits are summarised in table [ tab : moments ] and shown in figure [ fig : fmom ] .",
    "the five values of @xmath0 obtained from the event shape variables agree within errors , supporting the predicted universality of the power law behaviour .",
    "the theoretical predictions for event shape variables , being incomplete , give different estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the measurements are fully correlated , the best estimates of the overall values are obtained by taking an unweighted average : @xmath57 the first error on each measurement is experimental and is obtained from the average of the five errors on @xmath0 and @xmath4 . to estimate theoretical uncertainties we vary the renormalisation scale between @xmath58 and @xmath59 and @xmath0 and @xmath60 vary on average by @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "a variation of @xmath41 in the range from 1 to 3  gives an additional uncertainty on @xmath5 of @xmath1 0.0010 .",
    "these two estimates of theoretical uncertainties are combined in quadrature and quoted as the second error .",
    "we have also measured the second moments of these shape variables which are summarised in table [ tab : smom ] .",
    "the energy dependence of these moments has been analysed in terms of power law corrections . for variables",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath23 and @xmath26 , the following result is expected to hold @xcite : @xmath63 this assumes that the non - perturbative correction to the distributions causes only a shift . for jet broadenings the power corrections are more complicated .",
    "the @xmath2@xmath64 term has been parametrised as @xmath65 and is expected to be small for @xmath36 , @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "fits have been performed to the second moments where @xmath0 and @xmath4 have been fixed to the values obtained from the corresponding fits to the first moments .",
    "figure [ fig : smom ] shows the second moments compared to these fits .",
    "the contributions of the @xmath2@xmath64 term are non - negligible for @xmath36 and @xmath26 , in contradiction with the expectation .",
    "the five values of @xmath66 , as obtained from the fits , are summarised in table  [ tab : moments ] .      in order to derive @xmath4 from event shape variables at each energy point",
    "we fit the measured distributions to theoretical calculations based on @xmath2@xmath3 perturbative qcd with resummed leading and next - to - leading order terms .",
    "these calculations are performed at parton level and do not include heavy quark mass effects . to compare the analytical calculations with the experimental distributions ,",
    "the effects of hadronisation and decays have been corrected for using monte carlo programs .",
    "the fit ranges used take into account the limited statistics at high energy as well as the reliability of the resummation calculation and are given in table [ tab : als ] . in this analysis , we determine @xmath4 at @xmath8 = 130 , 136 and 189   for the first time .",
    "we also include the measurements done at @xmath8 = 161 , 172 and 183   since the experimental systematic uncertainties are considerably reduced by using an improved selection method and by subtracting the statistical component of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "all the measurements are summarised in table [ tab : als ] .",
    "these measurements supersede those published previously@xcite .",
    "the experimental errors include the statistical errors and the experimental systematic uncertainties .",
    "the theoretical error is obtained from estimates @xcite of the hadronisation uncertainty and of the errors coming from the uncalculated higher orders in the qcd predictions .",
    "the estimate of the theoretical error does not always reflect the true size of uncalculated higher order terms .",
    "an independent estimate is obtained from a comparison of @xmath4 measurements from many event shape variables which are affected differently by higher order corrections and hadronisation effects . to obtain a combined value for the strong coupling constant",
    "we take the unweighted average of the five @xmath4 values .",
    "we estimate the overall theoretical error from the simple average of the five theoretical errors or from half of the maximum spread in the five @xmath4 values .",
    "both estimates yield similar results .",
    "the combined results are summarised in table [ tab : alscomb ] .",
    "the earlier measurements at @xmath8 = @xmath15 and at reduced centre - of - mass energies determined @xmath4 from four event shape variables only : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for comparison we also provide in table [ tab : alscomb ] the mean from these four measurements .",
    "we compare the energy dependence of the measured @xmath4 values with the prediction from qcd in figure [ fig : alsevol]a .",
    "the theoretical errors are strongly correlated between these measurements .",
    "the error appropriate to a measurement of the energy dependence of @xmath4 can then be considered to be experimental .",
    "the experimental systematic errors on @xmath4 are dominated by the background uncertainties .",
    "these are similar for all the individual low energy or high energy data points but differ between the low energy , z peak and high energy data sets .",
    "the experimental systematic errors are then different and uncorrelated between the three data sets , but are taken as fully correlated between individual low energy or high energy measurements .",
    "the thirteen measurements in figure  [ fig : alsevol]a are shown with experimental errors only , together with a fit to the qcd evolution equation @xcite with @xmath67 as a free parameter .",
    "the fit gives a @xmath68 of 13.5 for 12 degrees of freedom corresponding to a confidence level of 0.34 with a fitted value of @xmath4 : @xmath69 the first error is experimental and the second error is theoretical . on the other hand , a fit with constant @xmath4 gives a @xmath68 of 65.1 for 12 degrees of freedom .",
    "the value of @xmath5 thus obtained is in agreement with the value obtained in the power law ansatz analysis considering the experimental and the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : alsevol]b summarises the @xmath4 values determined by l3 from the @xmath70 lifetime measurement  @xcite , z lineshape  @xcite and event shape distributions at various energies , together with the qcd prediction obtained from a fit to the event shape measurements only .",
    "these measurements support the energy evolution of the strong coupling constant predicted by qcd .",
    "the slope in the energy evolution of @xmath4 depends on the number of active flavours .",
    "we have performed a fit with @xmath45 as a free parameter along with @xmath4 and obtain the number of active flavours : @xmath71 where the first error is experimental and the second is due to theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the errors have been estimated by using the covariance matrix determined from experimental and overall errors on @xmath4 in the fit .",
    "this result agrees with the expectation @xmath45 = 5 .",
    "we have measured distributions of event shape variables in hadronic events from @xmath6 annihilation at centre - of - mass energies from 30  to 189 .",
    "these distributions as well as the energy dependence of their first moments are well described by parton shower models .",
    "the energy dependence of the first two moments has been compared with second order perturbative qcd with power law corrections for the non - perturbative effects .",
    "the fits of the five event shape variables agree with a universal power law behaviour giving @xmath0 = 0.537 @xmath1 0.070 ( exp ) @xmath1 0.021 ( th ) .",
    "we find a non - negligible contribution from an @xmath2@xmath64 term in describing the second moments of @xmath36 , @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "the event shape distributions are compared to second order qcd calculations together with resummed leading and next - to - leading log terms .",
    "the data are well described by these calculations at all energies .",
    "the measurements demonstrate the running of @xmath4 as expected in qcd with a value of @xmath5 = 0.1215 @xmath1 0.0012 ( exp ) @xmath1 0.0061 ( th ) . from the energy dependence of @xmath4",
    ", we determine the number of active flavours to be @xmath45 = 5.0 @xmath1 1.3 ( exp ) @xmath1  2.0  ( th ) .",
    "we express our gratitude to the cern accelerator divisions for the excellent performance of the lep machine .",
    "we acknowledge with appreciation the effort of the engineers , technicians and support staff who have participated in the construction and maintenance of this experiment .",
