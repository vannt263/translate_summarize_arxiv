    "supply chains are networks of firms ( supply chain members ) which act in order to deliver a product to the end consumer .",
    "supply chain members are concerned with optimizing their own objectives and this results in a poor performance of the supply chain . in other words local optimum policies of members do not result in a global optimum of the chain and they yield the tendency of replenishment orders to increase in variability as one moves up stream in a supply chain .",
    "this effect was first recognized by forrester @xcite in the middle of the twentieth century and the term of bullwhip effect was coined by procter & gamble management .",
    "the bullwhip effect is considered harmful because of its consequences which are ( see e.g. buchmeister et al .",
    "@xcite ) : excessive inventory investment , poor customer service levels , lost revenue , reduced productivity , more difficult decision - making , sub - optimal transportation , sub - optimal production etc . this makes it critical to find the root causes of the bullwhip effect and to quantify the increase in order variability at each stage of the supply chain . in the current state of research",
    "several main causes of the bullwhip effect are considered ( see e.g. lee et al . @xcite and @xcite ) : demand forecasting , non - zero lead time , supply shortage , order batching , price fluctuation and lead time forecasting ( see michna and nielsen @xcite ) . to decrease the variance amplification in a supply chain ( i.e. to reduce the bullwhip effect ) we need to identify all factors causing the bullwhip effect and to quantify their impact on the effect .",
    "many researchers have assumed a deterministic lead time and studied the influence of different methods of demand forecasting on the bullwhip effect such as simple moving average , exponential smoothing , and minimum - mean - squared - error forecasts when demands are independent identically distributed or constitute integrated moving - average , autoregressive processes or autoregressive - moving averages ( see graves @xcite , lee et al .",
    "@xcite , chen et al . @xcite and @xcite , alwan et al .",
    "@xcite , zhang @xcite and duc et al .",
    "moreover they quantify the impact of a deterministic lead time on the bullwhip effect and it follows from their work that the lead time is one of the major factors influencing the size of the bullwhip effect in a given supply chain .",
    "stochastic lead times were intensively investigated in inventory systems see bagchi et al .",
    "@xcite , hariharan and zipkin @xcite , mohebbi and posner @xcite , sarker and zangwill @xcite , song @xcite and @xcite , song and zipkin @xcite and @xcite and zipkin @xcite .",
    "most of these works consider the so - called exogenous lead times that is they do not depend on the system e.g. the lead times are independent of the orders or the capacity utilization of a supplier .",
    "moreover these articles studied how the variable lead times affect the control parameter , the inventory level or the costs .",
    "one can investigate the so - called endogeneous lead times that depends on the system .",
    "this is analyzed in so and zheng @xcite showing the impact of endogeneous lead times on the amplification of the order variance and has been done by simulation .",
    "recently the impact of stochastic lead times on the bullwhip effect is intensively investigated .",
    "the main aim of this article is to review papers devoted to stochastic lead times in supply chains in the context of the bullwhip effect especially those which quantify the effect .",
    "moreover we modify a model where stochastic lead times and lead time demand forecasting are considered . in this model",
    "we find an analytical expression for the bullwhip effect measure which indicates that the distribution of a lead time ( the probability of the longest lead time and its expectation and variance ) and the delay parameter of the lead time demand prediction are the main factors of the bullwhip phenomenon .    in tab .",
    "[ tabpapers ] we collect all the main articles in which models on the bullwhip effect with stochastic lead times are provided ( except the famous works of chen et al . @xcite and @xcite where deterministic lead time is considered and some of them analyze the effect using simulation ) .",
    ".articles on the impact of lead time on the bullwhip effect [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the main conclusion from our research is that stochastic lead times boost the bullwhip effect .",
    "more precisely we deduce from the presented models that the effect is amplified by the increase of the expected value , variance and the probability of the largest lead time .",
    "moreover the delay parameter of the prediction of demands , the delay parameter of the prediction of lead times and the delay parameter of the prediction of lead time demands depending on the model are crucial parameters which can dampen the bullwhip effect .",
    "we must also notice that in all the presented models the bullwhip effect measure contains the term @xmath0 ( see th .",
    "[ thltdp1 ] , [ duc1 ] , [ duc2 ] and [ bmmt ] ) and except the model of duc et al .",
    "@xcite this term can be killed by the prediction ( going with @xmath1 or @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) .",
    "the future research on quantifying the bullwhip effect has to be aimed at stochastic lead times with a different structure than i.i.d . and dependence between lead times and demands .",
    "one can investigate for example ar(1 ) structure of lead times and the influence of the dependence between lead times and demands on the bullwhip effect .",
    "another challenge in bullwhip modeling is the problem of lead time forecasting and its impact on the bullwhip effect .",
    "a member of a supply chain placing an order must forecast lead time to determine an appropriate inventory level in order to fulfill its customer orders in a timely manner which implies that lead times influence orders . in turn orders can impact lead times",
    ". this feedback loop can be the most important factor causing the bullwhip effect which has to be quantified and in our opinion this seems to be the most important challenge and the most difficult problem in bullwhip modeling .",
    "another topic is the combination of methods for lead time forecasting and demand forecasting ( to predict lead time demand ) .",
    "thus the spectrum of models which have to be investigated in order to quantify and find all causes of the bullwhip effect is very wide .",
    "however , these problems do not seem to be easy to solve by providing analytical models alone .",
