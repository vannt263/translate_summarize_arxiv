    "the theory of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) has been successful in predicting the abundance of light elements in the universe from a single parameter , baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the recent results of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment  @xcite , however , put this theory into challenge .",
    "the extraordinarily precise results from wmap are put together with the standard bbn ( sbbn ) to predict the abundance of @xmath0 to be @xmath3@xcite if we adopt @xmath4 ( 68 @xmath5 c.l . )",
    "this prediction is inconsistent with the observation of metal - poor halo stars which implies @xmath6 @xcite reported by ryan _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency persists even if we adopt the recent observations , which give the less restrictive constraint of @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be hardly attributed to the correction of the cross section of nuclear reaction @xcite , and astrophysical solutions are pursued @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach to this problem would be to consider the effects induced by new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "exotic particles which interact with nuclei will open new channels to produce and destroy the nuclei , giving a potential solution to the @xmath0 problem . in this paper",
    "we investigate a possibility that the interaction is initiated by a formation of the bound state of exotic negatively charged massive particles ( champs ) and a nucleus .",
    "( for the other solutions , see @xcite . )",
    "so far the bound - state effects by champs have been attracting many interests @xcite .",
    "for doubly charged particles , see also refs  @xcite . in particular , a significant enhancement of a @xmath9li - production rate through @xmath10 by the bound state with @xmath11",
    "was reported @xcite for the first time and recently confirmed @xcite .",
    "this hinders the compatibility between particle physics models and bbn @xcite .",
    "in addition , some nonstandard effects on the abundance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 were also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . introducing the champs with the mass of electroweak scale , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite newly considered several destruction channels of @xmath1 nuclei through the trapping of the champs to show that the abundance of the champs needs to be larger than 0.02 per baryon and that their lifetime has an allowed window between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we put the champ bbn scenario in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with the conservation of @xmath14 parity .",
    "mssm doubles the particle content of the sm by introducing superparticles , which can accommodate the champs .",
    "the champs need a lifetime long enough to sustain the sufficient abundance at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "although the @xmath14 parity conservation stabilizes the lightest superparticles ( lsps ) , the observational constraints exclude charged superparticles as a candidate for lsps , which is usually considered to be neutralinos @xmath15 or gravitinos .",
    "a possible candidate of champs is the next - lightest superparticle ( nlsp ) with electric charge , which can have a long lifetime by assuming a small mass difference from the lsp @xcite .",
    "we assume in the present paper that the lsp is a neutralino and the nlsp is a stau @xmath16 , the superpartner of tau lepton @xmath17 .",
    "the staus can decay into neutralino lsp with the hadronic current , through which they also interact with the nuclei .",
    "the gravitino lsp , on the other hand , does not couple with hadronic current .",
    "we consider the bound state of @xmath1 and @xmath18 in the early universe and the subsequent decay chain of nucleus @xmath19 due to the interactions of the two .",
    "the @xmath20 nuclei rapidly decay into @xmath21 nuclei , which are effectively stable in the considered time scale . with the freedom of the mass of stau @xmath22 and its lifetime @xmath23",
    ", we search for the possible solution to the @xmath0 problem that are phenomenologically acceptable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.channels ] we overview some new decay channels by stau and estimate their lifetimes . here",
    "we will see that stau - nucleus bound states play an important role in @xmath24be/@xmath24li reducing processes . in sec .",
    "[ sec.numercal_calculation ] we numerically calculate primordial abundances of light elements while taking into account the new channels .",
    "then we will see the possible solution of the @xmath24li problem .",
    "finally , summarization is made in sec .",
    "[ sec.summary ] .",
    "we consider a modification of the sbbn scenario under the mssm .",
    "mssm introduces a set of superparticles as the partners of the particle appearing in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the superparticles interact with the standard particles and thus introduce additional decay channels of @xmath1 and @xmath0 to the standard bbn theory .",
    "the additional channels give a possible solution to the problem where the theoretical prediction of the abundance of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , or collectively @xmath25 , exceeds the observational results by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "we consider in the present paper that the destruction of primordial @xmath25 nuclei is due to their interaction with the negatively charged staus @xmath18 , the superpartner of the tau lepton @xmath27 , which we identify as the next - lightest superparticle ( nlsp ) .",
    "the mass eigenstate of the stau is given by the linear combination of the left - handed stau @xmath28 and the right - handed staus @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the left - right mixing angle and @xmath32 is the cp - violating phase .",
    "staus have attractive features when considering the destruction of @xmath25 .",
    "first , staus have a negative charge and can form a bound state with nuclei so that they interact efficiently .",
    "second , staus couples with the hadronic current @xmath33 , through which they interact with nuclei as we see below .",
    "third , staus can be abundant at the time of bbn .",
    "they can acquire the sufficientlty long lifetime when the staus and lsps , which we assume as the nutralinos , have a mass difference tiny enough .",
    "the interaction of staus is described by the lagrangian @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fermi constant , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the chiral projection operators , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the coupling constants .",
    "these coupling constants are written in terms of the @xmath41 gauge - coupling constant @xmath42 ; when the neutralino is bino like , for instance , they are given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the interaction lagrangian ( [ stau_lagrangian ] ) give rise to the following decay channels ( see fig . [ free_diagrams ] ) : @xmath45    , ( b ) @xmath46 , and ( c ) @xmath47.,width=302 ]    process ( [ eq : stau - decay-2body ] ) has a typical lifetime @xmath48 , process ( [ eq : stau - decay-3body ] ) has @xmath49 , and ( [ eq : stau - decay-4body ] ) has @xmath50 .",
    "since the bbn takes place @xmath51 after the big bang , the staus will decay entirely before bbn unless the channel ( [ eq : stau - decay-2body ] ) is closed .",
    "our scenario therefore requires @xmath52 .",
    "note that the channel ( [ eq : stau - decay-3body ] ) also closes when @xmath53 is less than the pion mass @xmath54 .",
    "although the required lsp - nlsp mass difference is small compared to the typical mass of lsp which is @xmath55 , it is preferable in attributing the dark matter ( dm ) to the neutralino lsps since it allows the lsp - nlsp coannihilation . with this tiny @xmath53 ,",
    "the neutralino naturally becomes a cold dark matter instead of warm or hot dark matter @xcite even though it is produced non thermally .",
    "hence our model is free of the constraints from the large - scale structure formation of the universe .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the stau - nucleus interaction processes that are relevant to the primordial bbn .",
    "three processes are discussed : ( 1 ) the hadronic - current interaction , ( 2 ) stau - catalyzed fusion , and ( 3 ) internal conversion of stau - nucleus bound state .",
    "we consider the lifetimes of each process because it is crucial to understand the impact upon the modification of bbn .",
    "staus can interact with the nuclei through the hadronic current and thereby alter the bbn processes .",
    "the abundances of @xmath56 are changed by the new decay channels : @xmath57 the process @xmath58 does not occur since @xmath24he is very unstable , while the pions can be either real or virtual ; here the virtual pion should actually be regarded as a hadronic current propagating between the stau and the nucleus .",
    "the pions produced in the process ( [ eq : stau - decay ] ) also change the proton - neutron ratio and thereby change the primordial abundance of the light elements .",
    "we present the lifetime of the free stau in fig .",
    "[ free_lifetime ] as functions of @xmath53 @xcite . here",
    "we take @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .    .",
    "here we take @xmath59 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the hadronic decay is dominant for @xmath64 while the leptonic decay is exclusively allowed for @xmath65 .",
    ", height=188 ]      another process to destroy the @xmath0/@xmath1 is nuclear fusion catalyzed by staus .",
    "a nucleus has a coulomb barrier which normally prevents the nuclear fusion , while the barrier is weakened when a stau is captured to a state bound to the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear fusion is thus promoted by forming a stau - nucleus bound state .",
    "the stau serves as a catalyst and is left out as the fusion proceeds through .",
    "this stau - catalyzed fusion process provides the following decay channels : @xmath66    the lifetime of the stau - catalyzed fusion is estimated to be longer than @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the stau - catalyzed fusion rate .",
    "be ( @xmath24li).,height=188 ]    the interaction between a stau and a nucleus proceeds more efficiently when they form a bound state ( see fig . [ bound_diagram ] ) @xcite due to two reasons : ( 1 ) the overlap of the wave functions of the two becomes large since the stau and particle are packed in the small space , ( 2 ) the small distance between the two allows virtual exchange of the hadronic current even if @xmath65 .",
    "the stau - nucleus bound state decays through the following processes : @xmath68 where the parentheses denote the bound states .",
    "we note that we introduce not only reaction ( [ internal_be ] ) , but also reaction ( [ internal_li ] ) .",
    "the @xmath21 nucleus can also decay into @xmath69 via @xmath70 decay with the lifetime @xmath71 .",
    "we do not take this process into account since this process is much slower than the scattering process ( [ he6_back_ground ] ) .",
    "the lifetime of the internal conversion @xmath72 is obtained from the lagrangian ( [ stau_lagrangian ] ) as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the overlap of the wave functions of the staus and the nucleus , @xmath75 and @xmath76 here @xmath77 for the process ( [ internal_be ] ) and @xmath78 for ( [ internal_li ] ) . the following approximations are applied to evaluate the lifetime further .",
    "we estimate the overlap of the wave functions in eq .",

    ". the matrix element of the nuclear conversion appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmav ] ) is evaluated by the @xmath81 value of the corresponding @xmath70 decay obtained from the experiments .",
    "the experimental @xmath81 value is available for @xmath82 but not for @xmath83 , however .",
    "we assume that the two processes have the same @xmath81 value .",
    "as long as we consider the quantum numbers of the ground state of li7 and he7 we can expect a gamow - teller transition can take place since they are similar with those of he6 and li6 and we know that they make a gamow - teller transition .",
    "the gamow - teller transition is superallowed and has a similar @xmath81 value to the fermi transition such as @xmath84 .",
    "our new effects have been treated as if @xmath24li or @xmath24be in its bound state would have an effectively new lifetime which is caused by the virtual exchange of the hadronic current with a stau .",
    "thus this new process is not the two - bodies scattering .",
    "so , there is no corresponding astrophysical s factor in these processes .",

    "this condition puts a limit to the formation rate of the bound state of a stau and a @xmath24li .",
    "we then need either @xmath123 ( here we use @xmath124 @xcite ) , or @xmath100 to be small enough .",
    "the former condition leads to @xmath125 , although this region is subject to the strong restriction considered in the previous paragraph .",
    "the latter imposes an upper limit on @xmath100 in the region @xmath126 , and fig .",
    "[ numerical_result ] suggests that this limit is in the order of @xmath127 .",
    "the tininess of @xmath111 shows that the internal conversion processes ( [ internal_be ] ) and ( [ internal_li ] ) are dominant over other processes such as the pion exchange and the stau - catalyzed fusion .",
    "we can confirm this dominance by an explicit calculation of the rates of these processes .",
    "we used the saha equation in our calculation although the formation rate is comparable to the expansion rate .",
    "calculation using the boltzmann equation will give a lower number density of the bound state @xmath94 and consequently shift the allowed region upward in @xmath128 in fig .",

    "taking @xmath130 , we obtained the parameter region consistent to the observed @xmath24li abundance .",

    "<S> modification of standard big - bang nucleosynthesis is considered in the minimal supersymmetric standard model to resolve the excessive theoretical prediction of the abundance of primordial lithium 7 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the stau as a next - lightest superparticle , which is long lived due to its small mass difference with the lightest superparticle . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a number of additional decay processes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly important process is the internal conversion in the stau - nucleus bound state , which destroys the @xmath0 and @xmath1 effectively . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the modification can lead to a prediction consistent with the observed abundance of @xmath0 . </S>"
