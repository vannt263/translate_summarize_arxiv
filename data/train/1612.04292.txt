    "the drell  yan process is a standard - candle process at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . due to the high statistics for the production of w and z bosons and the clean signature of their leptonic decays , it allows for precision measurements and a thorough test of our theoretical understanding of hadron - collider physics ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "for example , the drell  yan process at the lhc is used to measure the w - boson mass with unprecedented accuracy and z - boson production is sensitive to the effective weak mixing angle . moreover",
    ", the drell  yan process is an excellent tool to extract information on the partonic content of the proton and is employed in pdf fits . concerning new physics",
    ", drell  yan production is an important background for z or w searches . for many other searches ,",
    "the modeling of weak - boson production at large transverse momentum is essential .    to match the experimental precision , the theory predictions",
    "have been improved and refined continuously . due to its simplicity , the drell  yan process has often served as a first application for new theoretical techniques . concerning higher - order predictions in fixed - order perturbation theory ,",
    "qcd corrections are known at nlo for a long time  @xcite and the nnlo corrections  @xcite are available in fully differential form and cast into flexible monte - carlo tools  @xcite .",
    "the nlo electroweak ( ew ) corrections  @xcite are also available in public tools  @xcite .",
    "nnlo qcd corrections have been combined additively with nlo ew corrections in  ref .",
    ". a complete calculation of mixed qcd and ew corrections of @xmath0 is not available , yet .",
    "approximate schemes to include these contributions have been studied for example in refs .",
    "the dominant @xmath0 corrections have been recently computed in the pole approximation  @xcite . at the same order of couplings , the ew corrections to w / z - boson production at high transverse momenta recoiling against a hard jet are available  @xcite , as well as the corresponding nnlo qcd corrections  @xcite .",
    "to predict the transverse - momentum distribution of the vector - bosons also at low transverse momenta , the inclusive nnlo fixed - order calculations have been combined with resummation results  @xcite .",
    "the consistent combination of nlo qcd predictions with a parton shower , known as parton - shower matching , has been performed for the drell  yan process employing the mc@nlo  @xcite or powheg framework  @xcite . at the nnlo qcd level",
    ", parton - shower matching has also been achieved more recently  @xcite .",
    "the topic of this work is the parton - shower matching of the nlo predictions for the drell  yan process including ew corrections . while ew corrections are generically expected at the percent level due to the small fine - structure constant , logarithmic enhancements due to photon radiation in peaked distributions and due to weak loop diagrams in the high - energy tails of distributions ( so - called sudakov logarithms )  @xcite are well - known .",
    "the powheg method  @xcite allows to make these ew corrections available along with qcd corrections at the level of unweighted events . within the framework of the powheg - box  @xcite , several implementations of the electroweak corrections for the neutral - current  @xcite and the charged - current  @xcite drell ",
    "yan process already exist .",
    "we use an independent implementation of the powheg idea to scrutinize the previous implementations which keep track of photon radiation in the unweighted events  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we present new resonance - improved results following the ideas first presented in  ref .  @xcite .",
    "while the powheg method is nlo exact , one is sensitive to relatively large , unphysical @xmath0 effects if the w / z - boson resonance is not properly treated concerning the generation of real radiation .",
    "in particular in the context of the w - mass measurement , a previously observed discrepancy between the powheg result and other tools including ew corrections  @xcite , which might have led to an overestimate of the theoretical uncertainty , disappears . during the completion of this work ,",
    "an alternative solution to the observed discrepancy has been presented in a conference talk  @xcite .    as an additional feature in our approach , the differential k - factor due to ew corrections , encoded in the powheg @xmath1-function , turns out to differ from 1 only at the level of 1% or below around the w / z - boson invariant - mass peak .",
    "hence , @xmath0 corrections to @xmath1 can be expected to be negligible .",
    "the resonance - improved parton - shower matching is discussed in section  [ sec : resonances ] .",
    "it is convenient to use fks subtraction  @xcite to implement the powheg method  @xcite . as a technical addition , in section  [ sec : mass_regularization ] , we present the results for the photon - emission off massless fermions using fks subtraction in mass regularization instead of dimensional regularization .",
    "some details of the calculation are described in section  [ sec : setup ] , in particular those which differ from earlier implementations  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological results are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] before we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "technical issues are detailed in the appendices .",
    "the improved treatment of resonances within the powheg method has recently been discussed in ref .  @xcite . within the powheg method ,",
    "a real - emission phase - space point is attributed to the various possible particle emissions or particle splittings using the so - called @xmath2 functions . to reflect the soft / collinear enhancement in the real - emission matrix - elements ,",
    "the @xmath2 functions are usually based on angles and particle energies in a given reference frame . in the collinear limits ,",
    "the @xmath2 functions are unambiguously defined .",
    "their specific form outside the collinear limits is , however , a matter of choice . at nlo ,",
    "the result is independent of the choice for the @xmath2 functions .",
    "however , within the powheg framework , the @xmath2 functions should reflect the underlying physics to minimize unphysical artefacts within the higher - order corrections .",
    "in particular , in the presence of resonances , the @xmath2 functions should include information on the resonance structure of the process .",
    "for the drell  yan process including ew corrections , it is the objective to distinguish between final - state photon radiation ( fsr ) and initial - state photon radiation ( isr ) using the @xmath2 functions .",
    "for example , the diagrams for the emission of a hard isolated photon ( with momentum @xmath3 ) from the leptonic decay products ( with momenta @xmath4 ) of an on - shell z boson ( @xmath5 ) in drell  yan are enhanced compared to the diagrams for an emission from the initial - state quarks for which the z - boson propagator is off - shell ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "analogously , a radiative return event , where a photon emission from the initial state leads to an on - shell z boson ( @xmath7 ) has only little contributions from fsr diagrams ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "while fsr and isr emission beyond the logarithmically enhanced terms can not be unambiguously defined in general , reflecting the enhancement of different diagrams due to the resonant propagator within the @xmath2 functions improves the physical description as we will explicitly show in this work for the drell  yan process .",
    "the drell  yan process with ew corrections is the simplest resonance process which can be discussed in this context . here",
    ", the final state at born level is unambiguously connected to the z - boson resonance .",
    "hence , the problem to separate the cross section into contributions with different intermediate resonances ( the so - called resonance histories in ref .",
    "@xcite ) does not apply .",
    "moreover , the center - of - mass frame of the born process coincides with the center - of - mass frame of the resonance itself .",
    "therefore , the conservation of the resonant momentum when emitting a bremsstrahlung particle , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is trivially fulfilled by the standard powheg momentum assignment .",
    "the assignment of an emitted photon to isr or fsr via the @xmath2 functions , i.e.  the assignment of the real resonance history according to ref .",
    "@xcite , has interesting consequences for the drell  yan process .",
    "a wrongly assigned real resonance history leads to large corrections to the differential nlo @xmath9 factor @xmath10 , which is associated to each born phase - space point @xmath11 in the powheg method .",
    "generating real emission at a given phase - space point using the same @xmath2 functions , these large corrections are compensated at the nlo level , since the powheg method has nlo accuracy independent of the choice of the @xmath2 functions .",
    "hence , as mentioned above , the discussion aims at avoiding unphysical artefacts within the higher - order corrections .",
    "in particular , this question is relevant for the mixed @xmath12 corrections which are important for precision predictions for the drell  yan process , see  @xcite and references therein .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss our choice for the resonance - aware @xmath2 functions for the drell  yan process .",
    "the corresponding phenomenological results are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "concerning photon radiation , the drell  yan process has three singular regions .",
    "one region corresponds to photons radiated collinearly to the beam with an associated @xmath2 function denoted by @xmath13",
    ". moreover , there are two regions for photons radiated collinearly to the charged leptons , which we approximate to be massless ( see section  [ sec : setup ] ) , denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the default @xmath2 functions  @xcite can be chosen as @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the energies of the photon and the charged leptons in the partonic center - of - mass frame , @xmath19 the angle of the photon and the beam , and @xmath20 the angle between the photon and one of the charged leptons .",
    "for the drell  yan process , the general formalism introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite boils down to introducing the breit - wigner factors @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the invariant mass of the w / z - decay products , i.e. @xmath23 for fsr and @xmath24 for isr .",
    "the resonance - aware @xmath2 functions are obtained by using @xmath25 in the definitions of the resonance improved @xmath2 functions @xmath26 , i.e.@xmath27 for example , on - shell fsr kinematics ( @xmath28 ) leads to @xmath29 i.e.  the isr @xmath2 function is suppressed by the off - shellness of the isr diagram .    to investigate the resonance improvement further",
    ", we introduce two alternative resonance - aware @xmath2 functions for the neutral - current drell  yan process . the first one is based on the fermion charges which enter the photon  fermion coupling , i.e.  we define @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the charge of the final - state leptons for @xmath32 and the charge of the initial - state quarks for @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 functions using @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 are denoted by @xmath36 . as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath2 functions can also be based on explicit matrix - element information . in particular , for the neutral - current drell  yan process , the squared amplitude for photon emission can be separated in a gauge - invariant way into an isr , an fsr , and an interference contribution according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 includes only the diagrams with photon emission off the quarks and @xmath39 includes only the diagrams with photon emission off the charged leptons . due to this physical decomposition",
    ", the fks method can be applied separately to each piece , i.e.  the three terms in ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) are treated as three separate real - emission processes . for the isr / fsr piece",
    ", there is only the isr / fsr singular regions and the correct resonance assignment is guaranteed . for the interference piece , we use the same @xmath2 functions as for the full drell  yan process before .",
    "the corresponding phenomenological results are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , where we refer to the matrix - element splitting as @xmath40 .",
    "in contrast to nlo qcd calculations , ew corrections can also be performed using mass regularization instead of dimensional regularization , i.e.  fermion masses @xmath41 regularize collinear singularities and a photon mass @xmath42 is introduced to regularize soft singularities . for catani - seymour subtraction  @xcite ,",
    "the results for mass - regularization have been presented in full generality in  ref .",
    "@xcite . for collinear - safe observables ,",
    "the fks subtraction using mass regularization can be formulated such that only the soft - virtual contribution has to be modified . here , we present results for photon emission off massless fermions , i.e.   we keep the fermion masses only as a regulator in mass - singular logarithms and neglect the fermion masses otherwise .    in complete analogy to the soft - virtual contribution in section 2.4.2 .  of ref",
    "@xcite , the result for ew corrections in mass regularization reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath45 run over all initial - state and final - state particles .",
    "the full virtual one - loop contribution is denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "it is assumed to be calculated in mass - regularization and , thus , includes mass singular logarithms .",
    "moreover , we have introduced @xmath47 with the born matrix element @xmath48 and following  ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath31 is the electric charge of particle @xmath50 and @xmath51 for incoming fermions and outgoing anti - fermions and @xmath52 for incoming anti - fermions and outgoing fermions .",
    "the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 read @xmath55 and @xmath56 in turn , we define @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where the index @xmath3 refers to final - state particles , @xmath60 to initial - state particles and @xmath50 again to both .",
    "moreover , @xmath61 denotes the center - of - mass energy squared , @xmath62 the energy of particle @xmath50 in the partonic center - of - mass frame , @xmath63 its momentum , and @xmath64 the factorization scale .",
    "the functions @xmath53 are derived from the eikonal integrals calculated in ref .",
    "the result for the usual plus - distributions regularizing the real - emission contributions in fks are obtained for the choice @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "other values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 refer to the modified plus - distributions defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see appendix  [ sec : app_mass_reg ] ) .",
    "since @xmath67 and @xmath68 only influence the treatment of non - singular regions , the dependence of these parameters is the same as in dimensional regularization .",
    "the integration of the real - emission contribution over the real phase - space and the initial - state collinear remnants which are regularized via plus - distributions are unchanged with respect to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite up to the trivial replacement of coupling constants and color factors by electric charges  @xcite ( see also appendix  [ sec : app_mass_reg ] ) .",
    "hence , the results for @xmath69 using dimensional regularization or mass regularization have to be identical for each phase - space point",
    ". we have checked that this is indeed the case for the drell  yan process .",
    "more details concerning the calculation are given in appendix  [ sec : app_mass_reg ] .",
    "to start from an implementation in dimensional regularization , it is convenient to express the above results in terms of the difference @xmath70 of the two regularization schemes",
    ". this difference can be written in compact form and reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite plays the role of the parameter in dimensional regularization usually called @xmath73 . since only the soft - virtual contribution changes , this result",
    "can also be interpreted as a translation rule for the translation of the corresponding virtual amplitude @xmath46 in mass regularization into the finite part of the virtual amplitude @xmath74 in dimensional regularization . in particular",
    ", the difference of the virtual amplitudes is of course independent of the subtraction scheme .",
    "the same result has already been derived in a different context in appendix a of  ref .  @xcite .",
    "we employ a process - specific c implementation of the powheg method  @xcite which is independent of the powheg - box  @xcite .",
    "the calculational setup and the generalization to include electroweak corrections are similar to the calculation presented in  refs .",
    "qcd and qed radiation are treated on the same footing concerning their generation .",
    "the qed processes simply enter as additional radiation processes . for the calculation of the @xmath1 functions , we additively combine qcd and ew corrections ( see also section  [ sec : results ] ) . in the following , we present some details of our implementation , in particular the differences with respect to  refs .",
    "@xcite .    as discussed in section  [ sec : mass_regularization ] , we have employed both mass regularization as well as dimensional regularization to treat the infrared ( soft and collinear ) divergences of the ew loop integrals . adding the corresponding soft endpoint of the real - emission contribution , the soft - virtual contribution @xmath69 is independent of the regularization scheme at each born phase - space point .    in contrast to the powheg - box implementation of the ew corrections to the drell  yan process  @xcite",
    ", we consider all fermions to be massless ( except for the regulator masses in mass regularization ) .",
    "in particular , the fermions are treated as massless in the real - emission matrix elements and for the generation of phase - space .",
    "the massless - fermion approximation is adequate as long as the transverse momentum of emitted photons with respect to their emitters is large compared to the physical lepton mass . in the powheg method",
    ", the generation of the hardest emission is usually performed only above a given minimal transverse momentum @xmath75 .",
    "if massive fermions are used , this cut - off can in principle be removed for the generation of photon radiation . for a massless calculation",
    ", it has to be much larger than the lepton mass .",
    "since a simultaneous simulation of qcd and qed radiation requires a cut - off above the qcd scale anyway , we do not consider this limitation as a serious drawback .",
    "we use @xmath76 for the results shown in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "photon radiation beyond the hardest emission or below @xmath75 is then generated by the qed shower employing the physical lepton masses . to provide the qed shower with massive leptons we use a simple on - shell projection for the lepton momenta .",
    "we rescale the three momenta of the two leptons in the rest frame of the lepton pair so that on - shell massive four - momenta are obtained . by varying @xmath75 and simulating photon emission only ( i.e.  qcd emission is turned off ) , we have verified that the massless fermion approximation is valid within the statistical fluctuations at the per mill level .",
    "in contrast to  refs .",
    "@xcite , all complications induced by the usage of massive fermions in the amplitudes are avoided . for simplicity ,",
    "all results are given for so - called bare muons , i.e.  no photon ",
    "lepton recombination is performed ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "there is a singular region according to the fks prescription for initial - state radiation and for the emission off each final - state lepton . before resonance improvement , we have used the @xmath2 functions in section  [ sec : resonances ] which are also used in the powheg - box version 2 with the setting `` ` olddij=1 ` ''",
    ". we do not observe qualitative differences if the default @xmath2 functions of version 2 are used .",
    "we have also adapted exactly the same running for @xmath77 like the powheg - box . to scrutinize the resonance description",
    ", we also investigate the various @xmath2 functions introduced in  section  [ sec : resonances ] .",
    "the virtual corrections for the charged - current drell  yan process are taken from ref .",
    "the virtual corrections for the neutral - current drell  yan process have been extensively checked against ref .",
    "the real - emission matrix elements have been calculated with madgraph5_amc@nlo  @xcite .",
    "we do not include photon - induced processes in our analysis .",
    "their inclusion is straight - forward but does not add anything to the discussion of resonance improvements .",
    "we generate unweighted events in the lhe format  @xcite and pass them to pythia 8.215  @xcite for showering .",
    "since we are interested in the effects of the parton - shower matching , we switch off hadronization and multi - parton interactions .",
    "all relevant pythia and powheg - box settings are given in appendix  [ sec : appendix : pythia ] .",

    "concerning the electroweak input - parameter scheme , we employ the so - called @xmath84 scheme .",
    "the numerical value for the fine structure constant @xmath85 is based on the fermi constant and the gauge - boson masses in this scheme according to @xmath86 we use @xmath85 in the calculation of @xmath1 to absorb various higher - order corrections into the leading - order result ( see for example the discussion in  ref .",
