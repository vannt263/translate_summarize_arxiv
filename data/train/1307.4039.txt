    "electrically detected magnetic resonance ( edmr ) has been widely used as a high - sensitivity alternative to conventional electron spin resonance ( esr ) to study paramagnetic point defects in semiconductors  @xcite . a large class of spin - dependent recombination processes investigated with edmr is based on the formation and recombination of weakly coupled spin pairs  @xcite .",
    "a prototype example of such a spin pair recombination process is observed in phosphorus - doped crystalline si , where paramagnetic interface defects ( e.g. p@xmath1-centers ) at the si / sio@xmath0 interface and @xmath2p donors in their vicinity constitute the spin pair ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratescheme ] )  @xcite .",
    "detailed understanding and modeling of such recombination mechanisms require the knowledge of the time constants involved in the different steps of the recombination process  @xcite .",
    "this is especially important for the design of complex pulse sequences like , e.g. , pulsed electrically detected electron nuclear double resonance ( endor )  @xcite . using continuous wave ( cw ) edmr measurements , these time constants can be inferred , if at all , only indirectly via , e.g. , a variation of the magnetic field modulation frequency or the microwave field amplitude  @xcite . here ,",
    "pulsed edmr under cw illumination  @xcite offers a more direct way of accessing some of these time constants , e.g. , by measuring the current transient after an excitation of the spin system by a short microwave pulse  @xcite or by applying special pulse sequences  @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches suffer from several drawbacks like the difficulty of separating the different time constants involved and the influence of the bandwidth of the detection setup on the observed time constants .    in this paper",
    ", we use pulsed edmr in combination with time - programmed optical excitation to determine the time constants of the spin - dependent recombination process via @xmath2p - p@xmath3 spin pairs .",
    "this approach not only allows us to devise experiments which access the time constants of spin pair recombination and formation separately .",
    "in addition to allowing to measure the recombination rate of antiparallel spin pairs , this approach also makes measurements of the recombination rate of parallel triplet spin pairs possible , which have not been reported yet , and allows for the discrimination between electron and hole capture processes for the spin pair formation via pulsed endor .",
    "this paper significantly extends the measurements of the spin pair recombination rates as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ ss : recombination process ] , we first discuss the recombination process via weakly coupled spin pairs in general .",
    "we devise a set of rate equations to calculate the temporal evolution of the spin system in sect .",
    "[ ss : rateequations ] . in sect .",
    "[ ss : expdetails ] , we describe the sample and the measurement setup and discuss in some detail the spin - to - charge conversion for pulsed edmr with time - programmed illumination . in the main part of the paper ,",

    "[ ss : rs ] ) , the generation rate of new spin pairs ( sect .",
    "[ ss : generation ] ) , and the recombination rate of parallel spin pairs ( sect .  [ ss : rt ] ) .",

    "( ii ) upon illumination electrons ( holes ) are captured by the @xmath2p@xmath5 ( p@xmath7 ) with a rate @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) resulting in the generation of new spin pairs with a rate @xmath10 . for photo - neutralized phosphorus donors and p@xmath4 centers in spatial proximity",
    "a transition of the donor electron to the p@xmath4 can take place with a fast rate 1/@xmath11 for antiparallel spin pairs ( iii ) and a slow rate 1/@xmath12 for parallel spin pairs ( iv ) . , width=302 ]    in the following , we summarize the basic features of the spin pair recombination process exemplarily for the @xmath2p - p@xmath4 spin pair , defining the relevant time constants as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratescheme ] .",
    "this picture is based on the model of weakly coupled spin pairs proposed by kaplan , solomon and mott ( ksm model )  @xcite and elaborated in ref .",
    "it has been established that this @xmath2p - p@xmath4 process is the dominant spin - dependent recombination process for phosphorus donors near the si / sio@xmath0 interface  @xcite .",
    "we assume that , without illumination , the @xmath2p donors at the si / sio@xmath0 interface are compensated by interface defects and therefore are in the ionized @xmath2p@xmath5 state as sketched in panel ( i ) . upon illumination ( ii ) , electrons are captured by the @xmath2p@xmath5 donors with a time constant @xmath13 and holes by the p@xmath6 with a time constant @xmath14 forming @xmath2p - p@xmath4 spin pairs [ ( iii ) and ( iv ) ] with a generation rate @xmath10 .",
    "the spin pair will return to the @xmath2p@xmath5-p@xmath6 state ( i ) on a time scale of @xmath11 for antiparallel spin configuration ( iii ) or will remain stable on a much longer time scale @xmath12 for parallel spin orientation ( iv ) because of the pauli principle .",
    "consequently , a dynamic equilibrium is established , in which in good approximation all of the spin pairs are in the parallel configuration , which we refer to as the steady state . as will be shown in this work , @xmath15100 in the samples studied here , so that only a fraction of @xmath160.01 of the spin pairs is in an antiparallel state .",
    "esr - induced transitions of either the @xmath2p or the p@xmath4 electron spin lead to a net transformation of parallel into antiparallel spin pairs and therefore increase the overall recombination rate , giving rise to the resonant photocurrent quenching observed in edmr .    in the picture of the recombination process",
    "presented above , we neglect the possibility of spin pair dissociation through excitation of an electron into the conduction band , a key feature of the ksm model  @xcite , since at low temperatures ( @xmath17=5  k ) thermal excitation can be neglected and impact ionization is not expected to play a role during time intervals without optical excitation due to the lack of carriers in the conduction and valence bands .",
    "we also neglect the effects of spin decoherence , since typical decoherence times in the @xmath2p - p@xmath4 spin system are of the order of several  @xmath18s  @xcite , long compared with the timescale of the detection echoes used below and shorter than the other time constants of the recombination process .",
    "this allows us to significantly simplify the discussion of the spin pair dynamics in sect .",
    "[ ss : rateequations ] when compared with ref .",
    "@xcite by considering only the populations of the different states of the spin system .",
    "in this section we describe a set of rate equations modeling the dynamics of the spin - dependent recombination process .",
    "the spin system under consideration consists of the phosphorus electron spin ( @xmath19=1/2 ) , the phosphorus nuclear spin ( @xmath20=1/2 ) and the dangling bond electron spin ( @xmath19=1/2 ) , so that in general 8 basis states are needed to describe its dynamics .",
    "the discussion can be simplified by first neglecting the nuclear spin degree of freedom , since the recombination dynamics are governed by the electron spin states and the electron zeeman interaction is much larger than the hyperfine interaction in the experiments presented here , so that state mixing can be neglected .",
    "the number of basis states can be further reduced by considering only the relative orientation of the @xmath2p and p@xmath4 spins , neglecting their orientation with respect to the external magnetic field @xmath21 .",
    "this is possible since the recombination dynamics of the spin pairs only depend on the mutual orientation of the two spins forming the spin pair  @xcite .",
    "this manifests itself , e.g. , in the magnetic field - independence of the edmr signal amplitude  @xcite .",
    "these simplifications reduce the number of involved states to two , with the fraction of parallel and antiparallel spin pairs denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "an additional state @xmath24 is introduced to quantify the fraction of spin pairs with ionized @xmath2p@xmath5 donors and doubly occupied p@xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the spin pair is always in one of these three states giving rise to the normalization condition @xmath25=1 .    based on the recombination picture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratescheme ] we can establish a system of rate equations given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the typical coupling of < 1  mhz of the spin pairs studied here  @xcite is small compared to the zeeman energy , so that the eigenstates of the @xmath2p - p@xmath29 spin pair are in good approximation the product states .",
    "we also assume that all eigenstates are generated with equal probability , so that the generation rate for the parallel and antiparallel state is @xmath30 , in contrast to the probability of three to one of forming a triplet or a singlet state for strongly coupled spins as observed , e.g. , in organic semiconductors  @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ ss : transients ] , we further elaborate this model by dividing the generation of new spin pairs into separate electron and hole capture processes .    the steady state solution @xmath31=0 of eq .",
    "is given by @xmath32 the time evolution of the spin pair ensemble can be calculated by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the initial state of the system .",
    "the characteristic time constants of the temporal evolution of @xmath35 are determined by the inverse eigenvalues @xmath36 of the matrix @xmath37 .",
    "these eigenvalues are given by @xmath38 if the recombination of antiparallel spin pairs is much faster than the recombination of parallel spin pairs and the generation of new spin pairs , the expressions   simplify to @xmath39 in the case that the optical excitation is switched off , no new spin pairs are generated , so that @xmath40 , which simplifies eqs .",
    "further to @xmath41 under these conditions the characteristic time constants of the temporal evolution of the spin system are given by the recombination times of parallel and antiparallel spin pairs , @xmath12 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "this is the reason why pulsed optical excitation is advantageous for the characterization of the recombination time constants .",
    "if the simplifications discussed above can not be made , e.g. , for the inversion recovery experiment under continuous optical excitation discussed in sect .",
    "[ ss : rs ] , the temporal evolution of the spin system can still be calculated analytically .",
    "the resulting expressions are , however , lengthy and do not provide additional insight .",
    "we therefore will resort to a numerical solution of eq .   to describe experiments for which a straightforward assignment of time constants is difficult .",
    "in all experiments presented in this work , we use the amplitude of a spin echo  @xcite to measure the spin state of the spin pair . in particular , we employ a two - step phase cycling sequence where the phase of the last @xmath42 projection pulse is switched by 180@xmath43 denoted as ( @xmath44 )  @xcite . depending on the phase of the projection pulse , the detection echo sequence forms an effective 2@xmath45 pulse for ( + x ) or an effective @xmath45 pulse for ( -x ) and the signal amplitude is obtained by taking the difference of the signals obtained in the two cycles as discussed below . for spin systems with a sufficient phase memory time , the spin echo can be replaced by @xmath45/2-@xmath45/2 ( ramsey ) pulse sequence for which the same phase cycling sequence can be employed  @xcite .",
    "the phase cycling sequence removes background signals resulting from spin - independent current transients caused by the microwave and light pulses .",
    "in addition , it is used to realize a lock - in detection scheme by switching the phase at frequencies between @xmath46hz resulting in a tenfold improvement of the signal - to - noise ratio  @xcite",
    ". however , small differences in the amplitude of the microwave pulses with ( + x ) and ( -x ) phase result in an incomplete background removal .",
    "this can be mitigated by extending the phase cycling sequence to a 4-step phase cycle shown in table  [ table1 ] for which also the phase of the first microwave @xmath45/2 pulse is switched between ( + x ) and ( -x ) .",
    "the additional cycles 3 and 4 constitute the same effective pulses as the cycles 2 and 1 , as can be seen by the corresponding effective pulse lengths .",
    "however , we limit the following discussion by considering only the cycles 1 and 2 .",
    "to describe the spin - to - charge conversion under time - programmed optical excitation  @xcite , we discuss the dynamics of the @xmath2p - p@xmath3 electron - spin pair in terms of the three states depicted in fig .",

    "we use only two free parameters to fit the data for all three illumination intensities : the density of @xmath2p - p@xmath4 pairs @xmath57 and the ratio of the electron and hole capture time constants @xmath58 .",

    "the fits reproduce the general features of the experimental data such as the near constant amplitude of the current transient for different illumination intensities and the increase of the decay time constant with decreasing illumination intensity .",
    "some differences are however found , e.g. , in the time constant of the decay in particular for the lowest illumination intensity .",
    "this shows that the rate equation model neglects some features , most of all the distribution of recombination time constants leading to the experimentally observed stretched exponential decays but also , e.g. , the additional feature observed at @xmath67=2  @xmath18s for the lowest illumination intensity in fig .  [ fig : transients ] .    the value of @xmath57=4@xmath64  @xmath65 obtained from the fit can be compared with an estimation of the spin pair density @xmath68 based on the @xmath2p concentration of 3@xmath69  @xmath65 in the doped epilayer and the geometry of the sample . since the resulting area density of @xmath2p  donors ( 6@xmath70  @xmath71 ) is much smaller than the p@xmath4 density ( @xmath72  @xmath71  @xcite ) , the spin pair density is limited by the donors rather than by the p@xmath4 centers , so that @xmath68=3@xmath69  @xmath65 .",
    "this value is further reduced since we estimate that only @xmath2p  donors in a @xmath636  nm part of the sample are observed  @xcite , while the whole silicon layer above the buried oxide is illuminated and therefore contributes to the observed current .",
    "this reduces the density of @xmath2p - p@xmath4 pairs with respect to the whole volume through which the current flows to @xmath68=7@xmath73  @xmath65 , only a factor of 20 larger than the fit result of @xmath57=4@xmath64  @xmath65 .",
    "however , in this estimate we again neglect the distribution of recombination rates within the spin pair ensemble , possibly explaining the observed discrepancy .",
    "the recombination model discussed here differs in several aspects from the model used , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the photocurrent transient in pulsed edmr .",
    "first , we simplify the rate equations by neglecting the @xmath2p - p@xmath4 coupling of < 1  mhz  @xcite , since it is much smaller than the @xmath2p - p@xmath4 larmor frequency difference ( @xmath16 30  mhz ) , as well as the possibility of spin pair dissociation by emission of an electron ( hole ) into the conduction ( valence ) band characteristic for the ksm - model .",
    "most importantly , we explicitly take the different electron and hole capture time constants into account , which have been neglected in the description of the time dependence of the spin pair dynamics in ref .  @xcite . for the experimental conditions in this work , these time constants appear to be longer than the recombination time constant of antiparallel spin pairs , so that the time dependence of the decay of the photocurrent transient is mainly determined by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , while the rise time",

    "[ fig : transients ] . for much higher illumination intensities or in different samples , @xmath74 and @xmath75 eventually can become shorter than @xmath59 , in which case the decay time constant would be given by @xmath59 as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the rise time would be determined by @xmath74 and @xmath75 or the bandwidth of the detection setup .",
    "in most pulsed edmr experiments , boxcar integration of the spin - dependent part of the photocurrent transient is used to determine the state of the spin pair after a pulse sequence  @xcite . as we have seen in the preceding section ,",
    "the time dependence of the photocurrent transient itself depends on the spin pair recombination and formation time constants , so that the results of measurements of these time constants are expected to depend on the chosen boxcar integration interval . in this section",
    ", we will show exemplarily using a simplified model for the current transient and a distribution of antiparallel recombination rates , that the characteristic time constant measured by an inversion recovery experiment is determined solely by the boxcar integration interval .",
    "we further compare the results predicted by this model with measurements of @xmath11 for different boxcar integration intervals .    to allow for a simple description of the current transient , we consider the case of high illumination intensities , so that the electron and hole capture time constants are much smaller than the recombination time constants of antiparallel spin pairs .",

    "@xcite , the characteristic decay time constant of the photocurrent transient is equal to @xmath11 . for longer",
    "capture time constants , a reasoning similar to the argument developed now can be applied to measurements of the electron and hole capture time constants . under these conditions ,",
    "the current transient is given by @xmath76 where we have introduced the recombination rate of antiparallel spin pairs @xmath77 .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath78 before the exponential takes into account that the recombination current is proportional to the recombination rate .",
    "in particular , eq .   is a simplification of eq .",

    "@xcite including that @xmath79 , that the @xmath2p - p@xmath3 spin - spin coupling is much smaller than the difference of their larmor frequencies , and that the possibility of spin pair dissociation can be neglected .    in the preceding sections ,",
    "we have argued that the stretched exponential character observed in most of the measurements is a consequence of a broad distribution of time constants for different spin pairs contributing to the observed signal .",
    "considering in particular @xmath59 , we assume that the recombination involves a tunneling process between the two defects forming the spin pair .",
    "therefore , a distribution of spin pair distances over the ensemble under investigation results in a broad distribution of the recombination time constants @xmath59 , due to the expected exponential dependence of @xmath59 on the spin pair distance  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the current transient [ eq .  ] has to be averaged over a distribution @xmath80 of recombination rates to accurately describe the current transient expected for spin pair ensembles . assuming a homogeneously @xmath2p - doped layer of thickness @xmath81 with a @xmath2p volume concentration @xmath82 , the area density of dopants @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the distance between the donor and the si / sio@xmath0 interface , which , for simplicity , we assume to be equal to the @xmath2p - p@xmath3 distance . the integration boundaries @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the minimum and maximum recombination rates for the range of @xmath2p - p@xmath3 distances considered .",
