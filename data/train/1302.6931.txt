    "in studies of wave propagation through disordered wires two setups are mostly considered : bulk - disordered and surface - disordered waveguides . in both cases it is possible to discern between diffusive ( metallic ) and localized ( insulating ) transport regimes by comparing the wire length @xmath4 with the mean - free path @xmath5 and the localization length @xmath6 ;",
    "i.e. , wave diffusion takes place when @xmath7 while localization is observed for @xmath8 .    from the analytical point of view",
    "both disorder setups have been successfully approached .",
    "on the one hand , transport through bulk - disordered waveguides is well described by the fokker - planck approach of dorokhov , mello , pereyra , and kumar ( dmpk ) @xcite ; and by the field - theoretic approach of efetov and larkin , which leads to a supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath9 model @xcite .",
    "in fact , these two approaches were shown to be equivalent in ref .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the distribution of conductances @xmath0 in the full diffusive - to - localized crossover was derived , in the frame of the supersymmetric approach , for waveguides with broken time - reversal invariance @xcite . on the other hand , transport through surface - disordered wires",
    "has been properly characterized by the fokker - planck approach developed by froufe - perez , yepez , mello , and saenz ( fyms ) @xcite . other analytical approaches to transport through surface - disordered wires are also available in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for both setups , @xmath0 evolves from a gaussian shape ( deep in the diffusive regime ) to a log - normal shape ( deep in the localized regime ) .",
    "however , at the crossover between diffusive and localized regimes , the form of @xmath0 is highly non - trivial @xcite and importantly depends on the type of disorder ( bulk or surface ) .",
    "moreover , the dmpk approach and the fyms approach provide accurate predictions for @xmath0 at the crossover regime for the corresponding setups of disorder @xcite .",
    "in this paper we numerically study @xmath0 for a model of quasi - one - dimensional surface - disordered waveguides with tunable corrugation complexity : from rough to smooth . here , we concentrate on waveguides with time - reversal invariance .",
    "we define the corrugated surface of our disordered wire as a sum of harmonics with random amplitudes . in the rough limit ( large number of harmonics )",
    "the waveguide effectively shows surface disorder ; so that , it is equivalent to the step - like corrugated waveguide model used in refs .  @xcite . on the other hand , in the smooth limit ( few harmonics )",
    "the waveguide can be considered as a linear chain of attached chaotic cavities .",
    "interesting enough , the transport properties of a waveguide constructed as a linear chain of chaotic cavities @xcite are equivalent to those of a bulk - disordered wire @xcite .",
    "then , by decreasing the corrugation complexity of our surface corrugated waveguide we expect to observe , at the diffusive - to - localized transition regime , a transition in the form of @xmath0 from the surface - disorder fyms to the bulk - disorder dmpk predictions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the waveguide model we use as well as the scattering setup . in sec .",
    "iii , by extracting @xmath5 and @xmath6 from curves of the average resistance and average logarithm of conductance as a function of @xmath4 , respectively , we define the diffusive and localized transport regimes for our corrugated waveguides",
    ". then we study in detail the distribution of conductances @xmath0 as a function of the corrugation complexity in both regimes , diffusive and localized , as well as at the crossover regime .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv is left for conclusions .",
    "the model we shall use in our study is a waveguide formed by attaching @xmath4 two - dimensional cavities .",
    "each cavity of length @xmath10 is defined by two hard walls : one flat at @xmath11 and a corrugated one given by @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the average width of the cavity and @xmath14 is the corrugation amplitude .",
    "since we are interested in studying the transport properties of waveguides as a function of the complexity of the corrugated boundary we choose @xmath15 where @xmath16 are random numbers drawn from a flat distribution in the range @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this form for @xmath18 allows us to choose the desired degree of complexity of the corrugated waveguide boundary : from rough , @xmath19 , to smooth , @xmath20 .",
    "see fig .",
    "it is important to stress that once the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath21 are fixed we randomly generate ( through different values of @xmath16 ) @xmath4 different cavities that we attach to form a non - periodic waveguide @xcite . to this end",
    "the minimal @xmath21 we use is 2 .     and @xmath22 .",
    "in our study we go from @xmath23 to @xmath24.,width=302 ]        we remark that depending on the values of the parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath21 ) , the classical ( or ray ) dynamics in each of the cavities can yield mixed or full chaos .",
    "however , here we consider only the case of full chaos @xcite : @xmath25 .",
    "then , below we use @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "this set of parameters produces full chaos for any @xmath29 .",
    "finally , note that all lengths , here and below ( including @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 ) , are given in units of @xmath10 .",
    "we open the waveguide of length @xmath4 defined above by attaching two semi - infinite collinear flat leads of width @xmath13 to its left and right ends . the leads support plane waves with energy @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the longitudinal and transversal components of the total wave vector @xmath33 . then , using finite element methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) we compute the scattering matrix , @xmath34-matrix , which has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are @xmath40 transmission and reflection matrices . here",
    ", @xmath41 is the highest mode given by the largest @xmath42 beyond which the longitudinal wave vector @xmath43^{1/2}$ ] becomes complex .",
    "then , once the @xmath34-matrix is known we calculate the dimensionless conductance from @xcite @xmath44 with this definition , the conductance can take values in the interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the experimental realization of a scattering setup similar to ours has been recently reported in ref .",
    "however , we notice that in numerical simulations of transport through surface - disordered wires , step - like corrugated waveguides are more often used @xcite , among others @xcite .",
    "we also note that here we concentrate on the case of small number of open modes , @xmath46 $ ] ; the case of @xmath47 has been recently addressed in ref .",
    "in order to identify the diffusive and localized transport regimes in our corrugated waveguides , in fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot the average resistance @xmath48 and the average logarithm of conductance @xmath49 as a function of @xmath4 for waveguides with @xmath23 , 8 , 3 , and 2 .    for disordered wires",
    ", it is well established that ( i ) for relatively short wire lengths the resistance increases linearly with @xmath4 as @xcite @xmath50 while ( ii ) for relatively large wire lengths the conductance decays exponentially with @xmath4 in the form @xcite @xmath51 we extract @xmath5 and @xmath6 from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by performing fittings of the data with eqs .",
    "( [ avr ] ) and ( [ avlnt ] ) , respectively , see red dashed lines . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we also indicate , with blue dot - dashed vertical lines , the positions of the obtained @xmath5 and @xmath6 . from this figure , it is clear that both @xmath5 and @xmath6 decrease by increasing @xmath21 ; equivalently , the mean - free path and the localization length increase when the disorder decreases .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    "we label as ( ii ) and ( iii ) the diffusive and localized regimes , respectively .",
    "additionally , we identify with ( i ) the quasi - ballistic regime , @xmath52 , which we will not explore here .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that we found that relation @xmath53 ( see for example @xcite ) works well only when the surface corrugation is complex enough ; i.e. for @xmath54 .",
    "see upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . when @xmath55 we observe that @xmath56 .",
    "see lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in any case",
    "the diffusive regime is clearly discernible in our calculations for all the values of @xmath41 and @xmath21 we used here .",
    "note that to construct fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have used waveguides supporting @xmath57 open modes ( here and below , when showing results for different values of @xmath41 we always fix the energy such that @xmath58 ) .",
    "we obtained similar plots for other values of @xmath41 .",
    "however , by increasing @xmath41 the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 decrease and , as a consequence , the regimes ( i ) and ( ii ) become narrower . for @xmath59 , the highest @xmath41 we explored",
    ", the quasi - ballistic regime is hardly visible in the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the following figures we will use values of @xmath41 different from 3 to emphasize that our results do not depend on the number of open modes , once the transport regimes are well determined .    then , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we verify the predictions for the conductance probability distribution function in the diffusive and localized regimes . as clearly shown in this figure , where @xmath59 open modes were considered , @xmath0 has a well defined gaussian shape in the diffusive regime [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] , while @xmath60 has the log - normal form in the localized regime [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] . we know that the results reported in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are already expected and thus it may seem unnecessary to shown them . however , we decided to present them in order to stress that the transport properties , exemplified here by the form of @xmath0 , of rough and smooth corrugated waveguides are in fact similar except at the crossover regime , as will be shown below .     and ( b ) @xmath60 for corrugated waveguides with @xmath23 , 8 , 3 , and 2 ( from left to right ) in the ( a ) diffusive and ( b ) localized regimes .",
    "@xmath61 values of @xmath62 where used to construct each histogram .",
    "the waveguides support @xmath59 open modes .",
    "dashed lines are ( a ) gaussian and ( b ) log - normal distribution functions characterized by the values of ( a ) @xmath63 and ( b ) @xmath64 reported in the corresponding panels.,width=264 ]      as already anticipated , we have found that the most interesting result for the distribution of conductances appears at the crossover regime , where @xmath3 . here , we observe that the shape of @xmath0 does depend on the waveguide corrugation complexity . to show this , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot @xmath0 for corrugated waveguides with @xmath23 , 8 , 3 , and 2 ( columns ) for some values of @xmath63 ( for comparison purposes in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we chose the same values of @xmath63 used in @xcite ) . as a reference , we also include the surface - disorder fyms and the bulk - disorder dmpk predictions for @xmath0 . in each panel",
    "we plot three histograms corresponding to waveguides supporting @xmath65 , 7 , and 8 open modes .",
    "note that for large @xmath21 , in our case @xmath23 @xcite , the shapes of the numerically obtained @xmath0 are well described by the fyms prediction for surface - disordered waveguides , as expected ( see panels in the left - most column of fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , once the waveguide corrugation complexity is decreased , important deviations appear .",
    "moreover , when @xmath24 , @xmath0 fully coincides with the dmpk prediction for bulk - disordered waveguides ( see panels in the right - most column of fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this fact is more evident for @xmath66 and 4/5 where the differences between fyms and dmpk predictions are easily distinguishable .",
    "so , we observe an effective and smooth evolution in the form of @xmath0 , from the surface - disorder fyms to the bulk - disorder dmpk predictions , as a function of the ( decreasing ) waveguide corrugation complexity @xmath21 .",
    "we understand this result in the following simple way . in the limit",
    "@xmath55 our waveguide can be considered as a linear chain of coupled chaotic cavities , each one defined by the cosine billiard @xcite .",
    "then , the model of quantum dots in series of iida , weidenmuller , and zuk applies @xcite .",
    "moreover , this model reduces to a supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath9 model @xcite which turns out to be equivalent to the dmpk approach @xcite .",
    "that is , while fyms describes well the limit @xmath67 of our corrugated waveguide , dmpk should describe the limit @xmath55 ; as we in fact observe in fig .",
    "therefore , our waveguide model shows a disorder - to - chaos transition in the shape of the conductance distribution .    finally , we want to add that the parameters used in refs .",
    "@xcite , translated to our symbols , are @xcite : @xmath68 ( here we used @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 .",
    "then , since we are observing well developed surface - disorder fyms transport properties in our corrugated waveguides for @xmath71 , there is no contradiction between our results and those presented in refs .",
    "moreover , we think that it would be interesting to explore the limit where the step length , in the step - like corrugated waveguide model of refs .",
    "@xcite , becomes of the order of the waveguide width ; which is somehow equivalent to the limit @xmath55 in our waveguide model .",
    "we have studied the distribution of conductances @xmath0 for a quasi - one - dimensional corrugated waveguides with tunable corrugation complexity : from rough , @xmath23 , to smooth , @xmath24 .",
    "we verified that both , the mean free path and the localization length decrease for increasing @xmath21 .",
    "also , we confirmed that @xmath0 and @xmath60 have the gaussian and log - normal shapes in the diffusive ( @xmath1 ) and localized ( @xmath2 ) transport regimes , respectively .    at the crossover between the diffusive and the localized regime ,",
    "@xmath3 , we reported that @xmath0 monotonously evolves from the surface - disorder fyms ( when @xmath23 ) to the bulk - disorder dmpk ( when @xmath24 ) predictions for decreasing @xmath21 .",
    "we understood this behavior as a consequence of the underlying deterministic dynamical chaos ; since the waveguides having smooth boundaries ( i.e. , when @xmath55 ) are effectively linear chains of attached chaotic cavities .",
    "we believe that our results , as well as our model of corrugated wires with tunable corrugation complexity , may stimulate further analytical and numerical studies on the transport properties at the diffusive - to - localized transition regime .",
