    "identifying the epoch of reionisation remains a prime objective in modern cosmology .",
    "quasars at the highest redshifts , @xmath5 of which five are known @xcite , show a complete absorption trough blueward of the redshifted line from scattering by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium @xcite , the so - called gunn - peterson effect @xcite . however , because of the extreme sensitivity of the attenuation to the neutral fraction of , it is only possible to deduce that @xmath6 signals the end of the epoch of reionisation ( or even the end of the most recent epoch of reionisation ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one way of robustly determining the actual epoch of reionisation is to measure the luminosity function of the  flux of high redshift galaxies , which will be attenuated by the damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough in a less severe manner than the continuum flux blueward of .",
    "several searches for  emitters ( laes ) at @xmath7 have been made , yielding a ( currently published ) total of 13 that have been spectroscopically confirmed ( @xcite ; @xcite  two ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite  seven new ) .",
    "these sources show little evolution from analagous populations at @xmath8 @xcite , perhaps indicating that we have not yet reached the epoch of reionisation .",
    "studies using color break samples show a drop in the star formation rate by about a factor of five at @xmath9 from the peak at lower redshifts @xcite , while the surveys appear to show a flatter evolution @xcite .",
    "the color break searches are restricted to the small deep fields observed with hst , while , the searches for laes are intensive , requiring large investments of premier ground - based facilities , and they select only the most luminous laes .",
    "these surveys may therefore be biased towards detecting the more vigorously star - forming galaxies that produce large strmgren spheres which allow the  flux to leak out .",
    "this means that the measurement of the epoch of reionisation will be biased towards higher redshifts . to address this bias",
    ", we require a means of homogeneously identifying more modest star - forming galaxies at high redshift  this is what gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may provide .",
    "the luminosity function of the optical afterglows of grbs extends as bright as an absolute magnitude of @xmath10 mag at 1  hour after the grb in the rest - frame , and probably even brighter at earlier epochs . because of this extreme luminosity",
    ", they can be detected to great distances and therefore provide an exciting way to find very high - redshift galaxies beyond the current upper limits of @xmath11 and to map the star formation history at these extreme redshifts in a way which , if not itself unbiased , is at least independent of the properties of the underlying galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was widely expected that the advent of the swift satellite would produce a large rate of return of very high redshift grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the predictions appear , in hindsight , to have been somewhat optimistic , the sensitive swift mission is detecting grbs at a higher mean redshift of @xmath12 @xcite than previous missions such as hete-2 , beppo - sax and ipn .",
    "while this may make the afterglows more difficult to identify , it also gave hope that swift would find sources beyond the most distant - known grb ( @xmath13 ; ) .",
    "the burst grb  050904 discussed in this paper does just that , pushing the redshift limit for grbs beyond @xmath14 .",
    "hopefully it is just the first of many such detections stretching to still higher redshifts .",
    "high redshift grbs are easy to distinguish with coordinated optical and near infrared ( nir ) observations , since the gunn - peterson effect drastically attenuates flux in the optical bands .",
    "the mean transmissions as a function of redshift based on quasar observations to @xmath15 are tabulated in @xcite , and these can be used to obtain the redshift of a grb from its colors . however , swift s ultra - violet and optical telescope ( uvot ) is limited to observations at wavelengths bluer than about 6500 . for this reason , optical afterglows of grbs at very high redshifts ( @xmath16 )",
    "can not be detected by the uvot on swift , and hence their properties must be characterized using ground - based nir observations .",
    "grb  050904 was triggered the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on swift at 1:51 utc on 2005 sep .",
    "4 and rapidly localized @xcite .",
    "@xcite undertook optical observations in the optical @xmath4 and @xmath17 bands starting about 3.5  hours after the grb , but did not identify any afterglow candidate to reasonable limiting magnitudes .",
    "the subsequent identification of a bright afterglow in the nir @xmath2 band led to the interpretation that this was a grb at very high redshift @xcite .",
    "observations of the afterglow with the magnum telescope began about 12 hours after the grb (  [ sec : magnum ] ) .",
    "these observations allow us to generate a spectral energy distribution for the source at that time which yields a strong lower limit on the redshift of @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the photometric redshifts reported by @xcite and , and the spectroscopic redshift of @xmath18 measured by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the limits on the break strengths @xmath19 and @xmath20 are consistent with the object lying at the spectrosopic redshift (  [ sec : redshift ] ) .",
    "we describe these observations in the present paper and briefly speculate on the implications for the star formation history of the universe (  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "magnum ( multicolor active galactic nuclei monitoring ) is a 2  meter telescope on haleakala built by the research center for the early universe ( resceu ) at the university of tokyo and used to study agn variability @xcite . in order to optimise the efficiency of the monitoring observations",
    ", the telescope is operated in a robotic mode using queue scheduling .",
    "grb observations can be performed as soon as a notification is received by inserting the target and overriding the queue .",
    "magnum s principal instrumentation is the multicolor imaging photometer ( mip ; @xcite ) , a dual - beam optical / nir camera which covers a 1.5  arcmin square field in the @xmath21 bands ( though @xmath22 observations are difficult , and @xmath23 infeasible ) .",
    "the instrument , mounted at the cassegrain focus , uses an internal beam splitter to send the short wavelength light to a 1024  pixel square thinned ccd ( though the entire ccd is not illuminated ) , and the long wavelengths to a 256  pixel square insb array . because the limited field of view of the mip makes it impractical to observe the 4  arcmin localisations from swift s burst alert telescope ( bat ) , we target afterglows discovered by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) or ground - based follow - up observations in order to characterise their spectral flux distribution , and so attempt to determine a photometric redshift from the  absorption at high redshift .",
    "we use a pre - planned sequence of four observations , each consisting of nine individual minute - long exposures with a box dither pattern of 10  arcsec step : @xmath24 in the optical and @xmath25 in the nir .",
    "the final images provide an accurate and nearly simultaneous spectral energy distribution for the object .",
    "the entire sequence takes about 84 minutes , with an additional 5 minutes before commencing the grb observations in order to correct the pointing and focus after the slew .",
    "we observed grb  050904 in this manner between 13:57 and 15:07 utc on 2005 sep .  4 , or about 0.51 days after the grb .",
    "the final combined images are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] . because the only 2mass source in the field is a galaxy",
    ", the images could not be immediately photometrically calibrated .",
    "we obtained observations on subsequent nights to obtain @xmath26 calibrations of two stars in the field .",
    "the @xmath27 band was calibrated from the 2mass galaxy by using a large aperture to measure the entire flux of the galaxy , and applying a measured aperture correction to obtain the flux of the afterglow .",
    "the @xmath4 band was calibrated using sdss magnitudes for a star in the field , and applying the appropriate transformation @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in these two non - ideal calibration methodologies do not strongly affect our results , since the @xmath4 and @xmath27 measurements are less important than the @xmath26 measurements .",
    "the fluxes in @xmath28jy with 1  @xmath29 errors are summarized in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "these fluxes are measured in matched apertures corrected for the image quality , with radii ranging from 1.4 to 1.7  arcsec .",
    "the @xmath30 band observations are not particularly sensitive , so are not included in our analysis . since",
    "no source is apparent in the @xmath31 bands , we measured the flux in the image at the position of the afterglow .",
    "errors were taken as the r.m.s .  from zero of the distribution of flux in apertures randomly distributed over empty background regions .",
    "lr    @xmath4 & @xmath32 @xmath1 & @xmath33 @xmath2 & @xmath34 @xmath27 & @xmath35 @xmath36 & @xmath37 [ tab : fluxes ]    the difference between the @xmath2-band magnitude reported here and that obtained by ukirt at a slightly earlier epoch , combined with the unusual behaviour in the @xmath38 band at about this epoch reported by @xcite likely indicates that the source was somewhat variable during the period of these observations .",
    "such short timescale variability has been detected in other grb optical afterglows , with grb  030329 a notable example @xcite .",
    "this serves to demonstrate the need for simultaneous or near - simultaneous multicolor imaging , such as magnum provides .",
    "we show the measured spectral flux distribution ( sfd ) of the source in figure  [ fig : sfd ] .",
    "there is a substantial break at the @xmath1 band which places a tight lower limit on the redshift of the source .",
    "because the @xmath1 band data is consistent with a null detection we can not place any useful upper limit ( better than @xmath39 ) on the redshift of the source .    in order to obtain the redshift estimate , we fitted a power - law spectrum to the @xmath40 data , obtaining a spectral slope of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 ; though the error bar is large , such a shallow spectral slope is likely a product of intrinsic variability in the source during the @xmath2-band observation , as discussed earlier .",
    "we then modulated this spectrum with the and ly@xmath43 transmissions of the intergalactic medium measured by @xcite in high redshift quasars .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown for @xmath3 in figure  [ fig : sfd ] , where we also show the positions of the @xmath1 filter . in order to reduce the @xmath1 band flux to observed value",
    "we require @xmath44 at the 2  @xmath29 level and @xmath45 at the 1  @xmath29 level .",
    "the results are extremely sensitive to the adopted redshift .",
    "they are consistent with the redshift range of @xmath46 reported by based on similar observations with the vlt and also with the spectroscopic redshift of @xmath18 found by @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : breaks ] we show the break strength between @xmath4 and @xmath2 , and between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , directly compared with the measured values in individual quasars at these redshifts .",
    "the quasar values are measured by comparing a power law fit to the continuum in line free regions of the quasar to the directly measured flux in the @xmath1 band @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 band provides a weaker constraint than the @xmath1 band but would still place the grb at @xmath5 .",
    "observations of high redshift grbs can be used to infer the cosmological star formation history either through observations of the host galaxy or by translating the grb rate to a star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the most direct method is to assume that the rate of grbs as a function of redshift is proportional to the rate of formation of high - mass stars and hence ( assuming that the mass function is invariant ) to the total star formation rate . in order to make such an interpretation",
    ", we need to calibrate the grb rate versus the star formation history at lower redshifts , and it will always be subject to the assumption that the fraction of massive stars forming grbs and the initial mass function of the stars remain invariant at the higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    prior to grb  050904",
    "twenty spectroscopic redshifts had been measured for swift grbs ( excluding short / hard grbs ) , of which fourteen lie beyond @xmath47 .",
    "thirteen of these fourteen would still have been detected above the swift bat threshold of 0.2  ph/@xmath48/s if they had lain at @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates that the selection effects , at least in the gamma - rays , are not strong .",
    "here we make the simple assumption that the thirteen grbs summarized in table  2 which would have fluxes about 0.2 ph/@xmath48/s at @xmath49 represent the low redshift counterparts of grb  050904 detected over the same period of swift observations , which indicates that the efficiency of detecting grbs at @xmath49 is near unity , compared to grbs at lower redshifts .",
    "for each grb we give the redshift , the observed peak flux and the value of the peak flux if the source had been at @xmath49 .",

    "in particular , the success rate of detecting the optical / nir afterglow will be a function of redshift , as will the fraction of afterglows for which it is possible to measure the redshift , either from absorption or emission lines .",
    "this is a complicated endeavour requiring detailed monte carlo simulations of grb afterglow searches to determine which grbs with and without redshifts might plausibly have been identified if followed up in the same way as grb  050904 , and is beyond this simplified analysis .",
    "however , such an analysis is not justified at the present time , given the significant small number uncertainties in the data and the desire for a larger sample of swift events to use in bootstrapping the completeness estimate .",
    "nevertheless , our measurement will provide , at the least , a lower limit to the star formation density , since we know that we are missing some grbs .    because of these complicated selection effects , which have discouraged all but the most bold ( e.g. , @xcite ) from using the actual redshifts measured from the optical afterglow or host galaxy in determining the grb rate as a function of redshift , most other attempts have relied upon assuming that grbs are standard candles ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or using empirical `` pseudo - redshift '' indicators from the grb itself ( e.g. , @xcite ) such as the luminosity - variability relation @xcite .",
    "these methods buy a large sample size and better understood selection effects at the cost of uncertain ( by at least a factor of two ! ) redshifts .",
    "this results in a need to deconvolve the resulting rate distribution using the redshift errors , making it difficult to determine the true behaviour of the grb rate at high redshift .",
    "the relation between the star formation history and the grb rate has been derived by a number of authors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at @xmath50 where the effects of the cosmological constant are negligible , the number of gamma ray bursts per unit redshift , @xmath51 , in a given observing time interval is simply related to the star formation rate per unit comoving volume , @xmath52 , by the function : @xmath53\\ ] ] where the normalizing factor , @xmath54 , is assumed to be independent of @xmath55 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr ] we compare the shape of the star formation rate determined from the swift grbs with color - selected galaxy determinations of the star formation rate over the same redshift range taken from the paper of @xcite .",
    "we have set @xmath56  m@xmath57  mpc@xmath58 to match the observations at @xmath59 . within the wide uncertainties left by the small number of statistics",
    ", the current values can not differentiate between the slow decline seen in the color selected galaxies and a flat star formation rate with redshift .",
    "however , it is clear that as the sample size increases we should be able to make a valuable comparison .",
    "the grb determinations are more powerful in some ways , since they relate to all star formation including those in lower luminosity galaxies than can be directly detected at the present time .",
    "this holds promise that future identifications of @xmath16 grbs will enable a complete measurement of the star formation rate density at very high redshift .",
    "in the present paper we have described the observations of grb  050904 with the magnum telescope . these observations place a strong lower limit on the redshift of @xmath3 consistent with the spectroscopic redshift of @xmath49 measured by @xcite .",
    "the most immediate result is that grbs exist at @xmath60 , and that they can be identified using a simple set of near - simultaneous optical and nir observations .",
    "this presents the prospect of using the afterglows of high - redshift grbs not only as lighthouses to illuminate the high - redshift universe ( as is done for quasars today ) , but also as signposts to alert observers to the presence of the host galaxy , allowing deep follow - up observations to measure the  flux . with the discovery of more high - redshift grbs",
    ", it should be possible to form a useful sample for nailing down the epoch of reionisation .",
    "we also gave a simple discussion of the star formation rate history from @xmath61 based on the current swift grb observations showing that within the still broad uncertainties , the observations point to a flat or a slowly declining star formation rate consistent with color selected galaxy observations .",
    "grb  050904 is an exciting precursor to further high redshift grbs which should allow us to refine the star formation analysis and to study the properties of the intergalactic medium at these redshifts through color break and spectroscopic techniques .",
