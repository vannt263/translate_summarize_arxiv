    "<S> the number of hydrogen - like atoms produced when heavy nuclei collide is estimated for central collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider using the sudden approximation of baym _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. as first suggested by schwartz , a simultaneous measurement of the hydrogen and hadron spectra will allow an inference of the electron or muon spectra at low momentum where a direct experimental measurement is not feasible . </S>",

    "<S> 25.75.-q +    @xmath0 kapusta@physics.spa.umn.edu + @xmath1 amocsy@nucth1.spa.umn.edu    the production rate of lepton pairs is a rapidly increasing function of temperature and so has long been considered a good probe of the initial high energy density phase of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental detection of such direct leptons is a problem in the sub - gev range of transverse momentum due to the large number of charged hadrons produced and the need to disentangle direct leptons from those arising from hadron decays . </S>",
    "<S> but this is just the kinematic range characterizing a quark - gluon plasma at a temperature of 200 to 500 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> schwartz @xcite proposed to measure the distribution of atoms formed by the binding of a directly produced lepton to one of the charged hadrons emerging from the final state of the nuclear collision . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of the charged hadrons and of the atoms , together with a theoretical calculation relating the distributions of the three particle species , would then imply the spectrum of leptons . </S>",
    "<S> the beauty of the idea lies in the fact that nearly all indirectly produced leptons arise from the decay of hadrons , and these decays occur too long after the collision to allow an atom to be formed . of course </S>",
    "<S> , one still can not tell whether the leptons were produced in quark - gluon plasma or in hadronic matter , but this is another issue .    </S>",
    "<S> five years ago baym , friedman , hughes and jacak calculated the relationship among the spectra of the atoms and of the charged hadrons and leptons which comprise them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the formula reads : @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the reduced mass of the hadron and lepton making up the atom . </S>",
    "<S> since the binding energy is so small it is an excellent approximation to evaluate the hadron and lepton rapidities at the same rapidity as that of the atom , and to equate their transverse velocities as well : @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this formula is based on the sudden approximation which simply asks for the overlap of the outgoing wave functions of the hadron and the lepton with their hydrogenic state . </S>",
    "<S> the sudden approximation is valid because these particles are formed in a nuclear volume which is extremely small in comparison to the size of the hydrogen atom and over a time interval which is extremely small in comparison to the bohr period . </S>",
    "<S> the specific focus of baym _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. was on @xmath6-@xmath7 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> here we shall be interested in p - e , p-@xmath7 , @xmath6-e and @xmath6-@xmath7 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> our essential contribution is to estimate @xmath8 for the leptons , protons and pions in the relevant range of transverse momentum , and from these to estimate the number of hydrogenic atoms to be formed in central au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .    </S>",
    "<S> first we estimate the number of leptons produced in the quark - gluon plasma phase . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction rate for the process @xmath9 is : @xmath10 where the 12 arises from three colors and four possible spin states of the colliding quarks , @xmath11 is the fermi - dirac distribution , and @xmath12 is the matrix element for the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> approximating @xmath13 the momentum distribution for negatively charged leptons becomes @xcite : @xmath14 \\sqrt{(1 - 4 m_l^2/s)(1 - 4m_q^2/s ) } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for positively charged leptons is the same . </S>",
    "<S> if the masses of the leptons and the quarks can be neglected this simplifies to @xmath16 for the range of transverse momentum of interest in this context the masses of the muon and strange quark can not be neglected .    to obtain the total number emitted </S>",
    "<S> we integrate over the space - time volume according to bjorken s model @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the temperature drops with proper time @xmath23 according to @xmath24 finally @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the z - axis is the beam axis .    in general </S>",
    "<S> the integrals must be done numerically . however </S>",
    "<S> , if the masses can be neglected then the above simplifies to : @xmath27 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if one is interested in hydrogen - like atoms with a transverse momentum of a few gev / c then the transverse momentum of the lepton must have been @xmath28 which is just a few mev / c for electrons and a few hundred mev for muons . for electrons </S>",
    "<S> the above formula simplifies even more since their transverse momentum is always much less than the temperature . @xmath29\\ ] ] this invariant distribution diverges logarithmically at small transverse momentum </S>",
    "<S> .    our estimates of the lepton distributions also include those coming from the mixed phase as the system goes through a first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the quark - gluon plasma phase at the phase transition temperature @xmath22 is given by the distribution ( [ rate ] ) multiplied by the volume fraction occupied by the plasma , @xmath30 plus the corresponding rate in the hadronic phase multiplied by the hadronic volume fraction @xmath31 . here </S>",
    "<S> r is the ratio of the number of degrees of freedom in the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic rate is obtained from the annihilation process @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are standard and well - known @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the canonical picture of central collisions of gold nuclei at rhic is that the central rapidity region will be almost baryon free @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , central collisions of lead nuclei at the sps @xcite and extrapolations of nucleon collisions such as lexus @xcite suggest that the baryon rapidity distribution may be roughly flat </S>",
    "<S> . furthermore , initial temperatures at rhic may be as high as 500 mev @xcite and this will be reflected in the final transverse mass distribution of the outgoing protons since high temperatures eventually get converted to transverse flow . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , inverse slopes for protons for central lead collisions at the sps already reach 300 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a not unreasonable estimate for protons at rhic is to assume a flat rapidity distribution times an exponential falloff in transverse mass . @xmath33\\ ] ] @xmath34 is the charge of a single nucleus , @xmath35 is the rapidity gap between projectile and target nuclei , @xmath36 is the proton s transverse mass , and @xmath37 is the proton effective temperature ( not really a temperature , just an inverse slope ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we assume the charged - pion distribution to be : @xmath38,\\ ] ] with the pion rapidity distribution @xmath39 .    to get a rough idea of </S>",
    "<S> the numbers assume : @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 , @xmath42 fm for a central collision at the maximum rhic energy of 100 gev per nucleon per beam , @xmath43 for three quark flavors and a hadron gas with @xmath44 effective degrees of freedom @xcite .    in figures 1 and 2 </S>",
    "<S> we plot the transverse momentum distributions of p - e , @xmath6-e , p-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath7 atoms for a central au+au collision at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> the trends are easily understood on the basis of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the muonic atoms dominate the electronic ones because they have a greater reduced mass , and the pionic ones dominate the protonic ones because charged pions are much more abundant than protons .    in figures 3 and 4 we plot the number of hydrogen - like atoms expected per unit of rapidity per day for transverse momentum bigger than @xmath45 for au+au collisions with an impact parameter of 1 fm or less . a beam luminosity of @xmath46/@xmath47 sec is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> for the most abundant species , @xmath6-@xmath7 atoms , we estimate about 1000 per unit of rapidity per day for transverse momenta larger than 1 gev / c .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have reinvestigated the rates for the production of hydrogen - like atoms at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> the results are quite promising for their experimental detection . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen whether an efficient detector can be designed to observe them . </S>"
