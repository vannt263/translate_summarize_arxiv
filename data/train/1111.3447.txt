    "we will consider measures whose support is contained in some compact and simply connected set @xmath1 along with finitely many points not in @xmath1 .",

    "one of our main tools for studying these extremal polynomials is the conformal map @xmath21 mapping the exterior of the closed unit disk @xmath22 to @xmath23 and satisfying @xmath24 and @xmath25 . we will denote the inverse function to @xmath21 by @xmath26 . since @xmath0 has analytic boundary , the map @xmath21 can be extended to be univalent ( that is , holomorphic and injective ) on a slightly larger region , namely the exterior of the closed disk of radius @xmath27 for some @xmath28 .",
