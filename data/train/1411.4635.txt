    "@xcite we have demonstrated [ in a controlled renormalisation - group ( rg ) analysis ] that such single - particle interference far from the fermi surface is not specific to dirac materials ; it dramatically affects transport and the metal - insulator transition in _ any _ semiconductor or a semimetal in _ sufficiently high dimensions_. this applies , in particular , in the case of the quadratic quasiparticle dispersion in dimensions @xmath3 and in the case of dirac hamiltonians in dimensions @xmath4 .    as discussed in ref .",

    "the critical behaviour of the density of states for 3d dirac quasiparticles has been studied in refs .  .    as we have also demonstrated there , disordered semiconductors with the conventional quadratic quasiparticle spectrum @xmath18 in @xmath19 dimensions are also characterised by a critical disorder strength .",
    "although one might think that such predictions are of purely academic interest , the properties of high - dimensional semiconductors are observable experimentally : a disordered semiconductor with the quadratic spectrum in arbitrary dimension @xmath10 can be mapped@xcite to a one - dimensional periodically kicked quantum rotor , similar to those already realised@xcite in cold atomic gases to simulate anderson localisation in 1d and 3d .",
