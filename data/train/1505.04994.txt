    "the dynamics of quark - gluon plasma that intuitively been considered to live in the realm of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been studied through the lattice theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some simplifications are always required in order to reduce the calculation complexities as well as to cope with the limited computing capacity of the current state - of - the - art computer . on the other hand , experiments of relativistic heavy - ion collision",
    "also exhibit a collective flow behavior .",
    "the typical character which belongs to fluid dynamics is considered as one of the validating aspect for qgp to be modeled as a relativistic hydrodynamics system @xcite . in the development ,",
    "the discovery of new phenomena from experiment such as the shock wave in form of mach cone has guided researchers to materialize the gluonic - plasma model @xcite .",
    "recent achievements in hydrodynamics description of relativistic heavy - ion collision have inspired more researchers to use relativistic fluid dynamics approach on searching for viscosities of qgp .",
    "there is also a hybrid model that describes the relativistic hot plasma by unifying electromagnetic fields with flow field .",
    "the unification is represented by the effective field strength tensor , @xmath3 , combining appropriately the electromagnetic and fluid fields @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we follow this hybrid concept , except that all fields are constructed by following the first principle . in this framework , the strongly interacting system of qcd is considered as a macroscopic fluid system rather than the result of many - particle interaction .",
    "this scenario is , somehow , inspired by the works of jackiw _",
    "et al_. @xcite , where they took an analogy of a non - commutative quantum system in developing a mathematical description of fluid structure , that is still consistent when applied to the microscopic fluid system ( non - abelian fluid ) . instead of taking the same route ,",
    "we start with different way , i.e. , by following the first principle . to this end",
    ", a viscous fluid - like qcd lagrangian is constructed . by redefining the gluon fields , a sort of phase transformation on the lagrangian appears .",
    "we then obtain an expression that can be interpreted as a microscopic interacting fluidic system .",
    "this strategy also produces a hybridization that combines the flow field and the charge field in one system .",
    "further , by making use of the lagrangian , the formulation for bulk and shear viscosities can be obtained . at the energy level near to the phase transition ,",
    "the result of our calculation exhibits a large ratio of bulk to shear viscosity , just as what is being seen at rhic .",
    "this result corroborates the new findings on qcd plasma .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : background ] we briefly review the basic theory of fluid qcd , and explain the phase transition from the deconfined particle field to the flow field . in sect .",
    "[ sect : formula ] , the shear and bulk viscosities of gluon dominated qgp are formulated as a function of the energy density .",
    "the obtained results will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : result ] .",
    "finally , we will summarize our finding in sect .",
    "[ sect : summary ] . throughout this work we use the natural units , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "in general , the lagrangian of the viscous qgp can be assumed to consist of a nondissipative ( ideal ) and a dissipative part .",
    "mathematically , we can write @xmath5 where the ideal part reads  @xcite , @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the quark and anti - quark triplet , @xmath9 is dirac matrices , and @xmath10 is the quark mass .",
    "the kinetic term for gauge boson @xmath11 is built inside its field strength tensor , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "the same role is taken for the gauge boson @xmath13 of su(3 ) gauge group , the kinetic terms @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the last two terms , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , represent the quark currents from the su(3 ) and @xmath18(1 ) gauge groups , respectively , and @xmath19 denotes the coupling constant from @xmath18(1 ) gauge group .",
    "being a lagrangian of qcd , @xmath20 is constructed from the fact that the derived energy - momentum tensor has an identical form as the energy - momentum tensor of an ideal fluid , as shown by ref .",
    "it is the dominant part of the lagrangian that describes the unification of fermions and bosons from different gauge groups , that preserves the @xmath21 gauge symmetry .",
    "it represents a non - abelian su(3 ) fluid fields containing quarks and anti - quarks that interact with an electromagnetic field .",
    "the nonideal or dissipative part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : definition ] ) can be written as , @xmath22 this part is constructed from the relativistic hydrodynamics viscous energy - momentum tensor developed by landau and others @xcite . in eq .",

    "+ therefore , the complete lagrangian can be written as @xmath26    by introducing the viscous terms into the lagrangian , it is corollary representing a `` near to ideal '' fluid , while the system itself is near to the equilibrium .",
    "gauge symmetry of the lagrangian is preserved until the dissipative terms are added .",
    "this is understandable as the fact that gauge invariance is broken when the fluid - like system leaves its ideal condition .",
    "+ to introduce the flow property into the fluid field , a construction of relativistic form is in order .",
    "it has been argued that @xmath27 should be rewritten in a particular form of the relativistic velocity as @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 represents a dimension one scalar field .",
    "equation of motion ( eom ) for a single gluon field from the above lagrangian leads to a general relativistic fluid equation @xcite .",
    "this fact explains that a single gluonic field @xmath13 may behave as a fluid at certain phase and as a point particle at hadronic state with a polarization vector @xmath32 in the conventional form of @xmath33 .",
    "this is considered as a kind of  phase transition  between fluidic and hadronic states . @xmath34",
    "a more detailed discussion on this topic can be found in ref .",

    "this shows that from a certain point of view the lagrangian describes a general relativistic fluid system interacting with another gauge field and matter inside . besides that it also fulfills the basic presupposed idea that in comparison with the size of a system , the relatively long - distance , low frequency behavior of any interacting theory at finite temperature could be described by the theory of fluid mechanics @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq - of - motion - nonrel ] ) it is obvious that the flow characteristic describing a plasma is represented by the gluon fields and , accordingly , the system that we are working with is a gluon dominated qgp . therefore , all nongluon terms or terms that have no interaction with gluon can be omitted . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath43 does not change and @xmath20 is simplified .",
    "now the lagrangian reads @xmath44 here @xmath45 . besides describing the kinetics of gluons",
    ", it also indicates the self - interaction between small number of quark and anti - quark , the self - interaction between gluons , and the interaction between quark with gluon  fluid  , where it is immersed in .",

    "the energy of gauge field @xmath117 is set to @xmath118 gev .",
    "this value is taken with an assumption that the wave length of gauge field is about two order smaller than the radius of quark @xmath119 , where @xmath120 m. then , by using @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the ratio between weak coupling constant and strong coupling constant @xmath123 is found to be 0.0072 .",
    "it should be noted that from all of the variable values where gluonic plasma is conjectured to exist , the values of quark mass @xmath10 and the energy of gauge bosons @xmath117 span a large range .",
    "however the result in the figures does not much depend on the values of these variables .",
    "the reason is that the value of @xmath10 and @xmath117 can be reciprocally altered due to the assumption that the higher the energy level of gauge boson in a circumstance , the smaller the possibility of heavy particles to exist .",
    "if @xmath117 is set to a bigger value , then @xmath10 has to be set to a smaller one , and vice versa .",

    "_ for the qcd plasma , where @xmath1 @xcite , which indicates that for a hot qcd matter there is a significant increase of the bulk viscosity at the vicinity of critical temperature , where in this case the adopted critical temperature @xmath132 is about @xmath133 gev .",
    "it might be seen as an indication that at the hadronization process , bulk viscosity plays a more important role than shear viscosity .",
    "at least , mechanically , this large @xmath24 brings the tendency that the fluidic qgp becomes unstable @xcite .",

    "equation ( [ eq : energy - momentum - tensor_ideal ] ) shows that in the gluon fluidic system there exists no self - interaction between gluon fileds .",
    "instead , the interaction originates from the matter gluon relation .",
    "the large value of @xmath24 originates from the strong coupling constant in the gluon dominated system .",
    "this is just the opposite to the huge ratio of @xmath136 that appears at weakly coupled system @xcite .",
    "this is also related to the fact that for any nonconformal field theory the bulk viscosity will always emerge and a non - abelian gauge theory like the gluon dominated qgp that is modeled in this discussion becomes nonconformal at hadronization energy level @xcite .",
    "based on the first principle , an analysis started from the construction of a viscous fluid - like qcd lagrangian has been performed . the phase transition between stable hadronic",
    "state and highly energized qgp state has been investigated .",
    "it is argued that inside the hadronic state the gluons behave as point particles and their properties are determined by their polarization vectors .",
    "however , in the hot qgp state the gluons should behave as fluid particles and characterized by their relativistic velocities and their inherently attached scalar fields . by investigating the energy - momentum tensor for viscous fluid particles , a detailed derivation of the bulk and shear",
    "viscosities close to the deconfinement temperature has been performed .",
    "the result of this investigation corroborates the findings obtained in the previous studies that make use of the qcd low - energy - theorem approach .",
    "another interesting issue related to the result of the present analysis is the calculation of cross - section . in our approach",
    "presented in this paper , which is based on hydrodynamics , calculation of the cross - section seems to be difficult . in principle",
    ", it would be possible to relate the result obtained for the viscosity with the prediction of kinetic theories , where the transport coefficients like bulk and shear viscosities in a gluon dominated qgp are connected to the gluon cross - section @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this would require a much more comprehensive and careful investigation , which is planed for the future works .",
