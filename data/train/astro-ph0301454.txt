    "despite their rarity , hot massive stars are prominent contributors to the dynamics and energetics of the ism and to the global evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "the optical spectra of distant , star - forming galaxies exhibit numerous features typical of the uv spectra of o and b stars @xcite . in order to determine the properties of starbursts galaxies at high redshift , it is thus essential to understand the physical properties and evolution of massive stars in a low metallicity environment .",
    "o stars in the small magellanic cloud offer the best opportunity to achieve this goal . indeed ,",
    "the smc is a galaxy which is little evolved having a relatively low metal content , and is sufficiently close to obtain high - quality uv and optical spectra of individual stars .",
    "additionally , modeling tools to analyze the photosphere and winds of hot , massive stars with a high level of accuracy and reliability have become available in recent years .",
    "major progress has been achieved to model the stellar photosphere and stellar wind in an unified approach , as well as to incorporate a sophisticated treatment of nlte line blanketing that accounts for all the important opacity sources in the stellar atmospheres ( e.g. , programs cmfgen , hillier  & miller 1998 ; wm - basic , pauldrach et al .",
    "2001 ; tlusty , hubeny & lanz 1995 ) .    winds from massive stars are radiatively driven through the transfer of momentum from the stellar radiation field to the atmospheric material via photon absorptions and scattering due to thousands of metal lines @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of the nature of these winds is that the wind properties ( mass loss rate , terminal velocity ) depend on the stellar metallicity .",
    "for example , @xcite have predicted that the mass loss rate scales as  @xmath7 , for metallicities ranging from 1/30 to 3 times the solar metallicity .",
    "the agreement between their predicted values and the measured mass loss rates for samples of o - type stars in the milky way is good @xcite , but they do not agree well for lmc stars and a large scatter is found for smc stars @xcite . in this context , it is of special interest to derive accurate estimates of both elemental abundances and mass loss rates from the analysis of individual o stars in the smc , in order to provide an important scaling law for evolutionary models of massive stars .",
    "additionally , such analyses yield the quantities to further test the wind - momentum luminosity relation @xcite in a low metallicity environment .    following the pioneering studies of smc ob stars in the uv based on low resolution and limited signal - to - noise ratio data recorded by _ iue _",
    "@xcite or hst / fos @xcite , lennon led a spectroscopic survey of a score of smc ob stars at higher spectral resolution in the uv with hst / stis @xcite .",
    "about half of the stars are located in ngc  346 , the largest region in the smc which has been extensively observed with ground - based telescopes in the past @xcite .",
    "these new observations in the uv have been supplemented by optical spectroscopy .",
    "taking advantage of these new , high - quality spectroscopic data , @xcite focussed their interest on describing the wind properties of o stars .",
    "they performed a detailed study of two stars , av  83 and av  69 , which have similar effective temperatures , luminosities and metallicities , but show very different wind signatures .",
    "their analysis indicates that the o7iaf+ star av  83 has a slow , dense wind , which most likely is highly clumped .",
    "moreover , av  83 reveals a substantial enhancement of its nitrogen surface abundance , consistent with the presence at the surface of material processed internally by the cno cycle . on the other hand , the oc7.5iii((f ) ) star av  69 has a substantially less dense wind and has a surface composition similar to smc gas .",
    "these results are consistent with our current understanding of stellar evolution ( e.g. maeder  & meynet 2000 ) if av  83 is a fast rotator which has experienced rotationally enhanced mass loss and rotationally induced mixing . on the other hand ,",
    "av  69 would be a slow rotator .",
    "@xcite have systematically examined the influence of various parameters on the predicted spectrum , providing thus a solid basis for further studies of o star winds .",
    "we present in this paper the result of our spectroscopic analysis , from the far - uv to the visible , of six o dwarf stars in ngc  346 .",

    "high - resolution , high - quality uv and optical spectra of a score of o stars in the smc have been recorded to serve as a spectral template of a young stellar population in a low metallicity environment .",
    "a full description of the whole dataset and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the sample was selected with a bias towards stars with a sharp - lined spectrum , thus towards stars viewed preferentially pole - on or possibly towards intrinsically slow rotators . in this paper",

    "following @xcite , the hottest star of our sample , ngc  346 mpg 355 , belongs to the newly - defined o2 spectral class and has been classified o2  iii(f * ) .",
    "formally , it is not an o dwarf , but dwarf and giant stars occupy nearly the same location in the hr diagram at the hot end of the main sequence .",
    "the inclusion of this star in our sample allows us to sample a range from the earliest to the latest o stars .",

    "our radial velocities are very close to the values listed by @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet spectra have been obtained in the framework of _ hst _ general observer program 7437 ( pi : d. j. lennon ) for 19 o - type stars in the smc .",

    "the spectra are then normalized , because the predicted flux distribution in the far - uv not only depends on the assumed smc distance but is very sensitive to the adopted correction of interstellar extinction .",

    "the two other stars , , and , were observed with eso 3.6 m telescope equipped with caspec .",
    "the spectra cover an interval from 3910 to 5170 , at a similar spectral resolution , @xmath10 .",
    "the echelle spectral data were reduced uniformly with the figaro package by the ucl group .",
    "details on the procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "strong stellar winds , significant departures from the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and an effect of numerous metal lines , traditionally called metal line blanketing , present the major difficulties in modeling the atmospheres of o - type stars .",
    "these three issues must be addressed by the model atmospheres in order to provide reliable photospheric and wind parameters of massive stars .",
    "this involves constructing fully - blanketed , nlte models for an entire stellar atmosphere , going from a quasi - static photosphere out to the supersonic wind .",
    "considerable advances in modeling techniques have been achieved during recent years ( for a number of recent reviews , see hubeny et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and several computer programs that can handle this problem are available now  program cmfgen @xcite ; phoenix @xcite ; munich programs @xcite ; and the kiel - potsdam code @xcite .",
    "unified models , with a consistent treatment of the photosphere and the wind , are obviously necessary to analyze the p  cygni profile of strong lines in the uv spectra of o stars and then derive the basic wind parameters ( mass loss rate , terminal velocity ) .",
    "however , hydrostatic , fully - blanketed , nlte photospheric models may in many cases remain a preferable alternative to unified models with a simplified treatment of a photosphere .",
    "indeed , the bulk of spectral lines in o stars are formed in the photosphere where velocities are small and geometrical extension is negligible .",
    "the spectrum of slowly - rotating o stars show mostly narrow and symmetric lines ( see , e.g. , ngc  346 mpg  113 , fig .",
    "[ p113fig ] ) .",
    "this statement is valid in all but the most extreme cases of stellar winds , like those observed in wolf - rayet stars and extreme of supergiants .",
    "moreover , winds are weaker in low - metallicity environments making photospheric models even more relevant in this case .",
    "additionally , there are many remaining uncertainties as to the exact properties of stellar winds of hot stars , even though the paradigm of radiatively - driven winds is well established . for example",
    ", we do not have in many cases a consistent solution : the calculated line force is often too small to drive a wind through the critical point ( though some progress is being made ) , so a @xmath12-type velocity law must be adopted to describe empirically the velocity and density structure of the wind . while mathematically trivial , it is physically not so obvious how to connect the photospheric exponential density structure with the wind power law ( see hillier et al .",
    "2003 for a discussion ) ; some spectral features are formed in the connection region .",
    "furthermore , radiative equilibrium is not really satisfied in these winds , where shocks dump mechanical energy and heat the wind , thus changing its ionization structure ( e.g. , super - ionization ) .",
    "finally , the assumption of one - dimensional geometry is challenged by the likely presence of dense clumps in the wind and by rotation ; the role of magnetic fields is not yet understood , and their importance in structuring the wind will very likely be more important than in the photosphere .",
    "therefore , we have performed an analysis using model atmospheres calculated with the photospheric program , tlusty , and the unified model code , cmfgen .",
    "we intend to compare the parameters derived from these two nlte model atmosphere programs ; we may consider them as two independent programs although the atomic data used by the two codes come mostly from the same sources .",
    "second , we will examine the effect of an extended stellar wind on the photospheric lines in o dwarf spectra .",
    "we describe thereafter the basic characteristics of these two codes .",
    "photospheric models have been constructed with the model atmosphere code , tlusty   @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions of the code are a plane - parallel geometry , hydrostatic equilibrium , and radiative equilibrium .",
    "departures from lte are explicitly allowed for a large set of chemical species and arbitrarily complex model atoms .",
    "line opacity is treated in detail using an opacity sampling technique with close to 200000 frequency points over the whole spectrum . for this work ,",
    "we have extracted models from the new , extensive ostar2002   grid @xcite .",
    "these fully - blanketed , nlte model atmospheres include about 100000 individual atomic levels from 45 ions ( , , , , , , , , , , ) , as summarized in table  [ atom_mod ] .",
    "we have selected models with a scaled - solar composition , @xmath13 1/5 , and 1/10 , that are appropriate for smc stars .",
    "we have adopted the solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "all model atmospheres assume an helium abundance , @xmath14 = he / h = 0.1 by number , and a microturbulent velocity , @xmath15kms@xmath5 .",
    "the ostar2002   model atmospheres are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the omission of highly - excited atomic levels of light species in ostar2002   model atmospheres results in underestimating some recombination rates .",
    "we have therefore recalculated a limited number of model atmospheres with more extensive model atoms for and in order to achieve a better prediction of recombination lines seen in emission in the visible spectrum .",
    "tlusty   solves for the full photospheric structure , providing the temperature and density stratification and the nlte populations . a detailed synthetic spectrum",
    "is then calculated with synspec , varying if necessary the abundance of individual species ( e.g. , the n / c abundance ratio ) , or the microturbulent velocity .",
    "however , we have always imposed the condition that the photospheric turbulent velocity remains smaller than the photospheric speed of sound ( typically , @xmath16 25kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "spherically symmetric wind models have been constructed with the nlte code cmfgen @xcite .",
    "this code solves the radiative transfer equation in the co - moving frame , together with statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "the wind models include 28 explicit ions of h , he , c , n , o , ne , si , p , s , and fe .",
    "a total of 3300 individual levels grouped into 900 superlevels are included , with a full array of over 20000 bound - bound transitions .",
    "the ionization stages , number of individual levels and superlevels of each model atom are summarized in table  [ atom_mod ] .",
    "we have adopted an atomic data set that is consistent with the data set used by @xcite .",
    "radiative equilibrium has been assumed to determine the temperature structure throughout the atmosphere .",
    "cmfgen does not solve the momentum equation , and a density or velocity structure is therefore required beforehand .",
    "the velocity in the stellar wind is parameterized with a classical @xmath12-type law which is connected to an hydrostatic density structure at depth .",
    "we have taken the hydrostatic structure from tlusty   models . at the connecting point , we require that the velocity and the velocity gradient both match . o star model spectra are relatively sensitive to the exact density structure which is assumed around the sonic point if the wind is dense enough .",
    "@xcite have presented a detailed discussion of this issue for av  83 .",
    "since few lines show evidence of a wind in our stellar sample , this problem is likely not as severe as in av83 and most diagnostic lines should be insensitive to it .",
    "we have assumed a depth - independent doppler profile for all lines when solving for the atmospheric structure in the co - moving frame . @xcite",
    "have shown that the resulting atmospheric structure , level populations , and emergent spectrum , is not changed by this approximation . in this step",
    ", we used the microturbulent velocity , @xmath17 , derived from tlusty   analysis . in the final calculation of the emergent spectrum in the observer s frame",
    ", we have however adopted a radially - dependent turbulence , expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocity law and the terminal velocity of the wind , and @xmath21 is the maximum turbulent velocity ( see  [ windparsect ] ) .",
    "such a turbulent velocity law reflects the effect of shocks due to wind instabilities .",
    "moreover , we have taken into account incoherent electron scattering and stark broadening for , , lines .",
    "cmfgen can account for clumping in the stellar wind which results from the unstable nature of radiatively - driven winds .",
    "clumping is described assuming a volume filling factor , @xmath22 , that there is no interclump medium , and that the clumps are small compared to the mean free path of photons .",
    "the filling factor is parameterized following an exponential decrease @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the velocity at which clumping starts .",
    "we have assumed that clumping starts at @xmath25kms@xmath5 , just above the sonic point .",
    "the detailed implementation of clumping in cmfgen is discussed by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "we start the analysis using tlusty   ostar2002   models @xcite .",
    "the photospheric parameters derived from this analysis provide the initial values for a second analysis with the unified , wind code , cmfgen . in this second step ,",
    "we still allow for changes in the photospheric parameters , because cmfgen models also have a realistic description of photospheric layers .",
    "we then compare the consistency of the two analyses .      following a long - established way to analyze o star spectra , we first attempt to match the balmer , and lines between 3800 and 5000   to determine initial estimates of the photospheric parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath26 , @xmath14 = h / he ) .",
    "the to line strength ratios are the characteristic @xmath0   indicator in main - sequence o stars , while @xmath26 is constrained from balmer line wings .",
    "a simultaneous fit of all optical lines of these ions proves however often elusive .",
    "the task is further complicated by a nebular contamination of the balmer and lines since ngc  346 is embedded in strong nebulosity .",
    "our initial @xmath0  diagnostics lines are thus @xmath64388 , 4471 , 4713 , 4922 , and @xmath274200 , 4541 , 4686 .",
    "the latter line is often affected by a stellar wind , leading several authors to disregard @xmath274686 as a @xmath0   indicator ( e.g. crowther et al .",
    "however , the stellar wind of smc o dwarfs is weak enough ( see  [ resusect ] ) that this line may be helpful .",
    "we have not used specifically @xmath61640 . on one hand",
    ", this line does not provide additional photospheric diagnostics .",
    "on the other hand , we have not observed in our stellar sample much influence of the stellar wind on this line , mostly because the winds are not dense enough .",
    "in addition to the optical spectrum , we also rely on ionization balance of heavy elements in the uv spectrum .",
    "we need however to disentangle their temperature sensitivity from other parameters , _",
    "( i ) _ the microturbulent velocity ( e.g @xmath271338 - 43 , @xmath271502 , lines ) , _ ( ii ) _ the mass loss rate ( @xmath271338 - 43 , @xmath271371 , @xmath271176 ) , not to mention _ ( iii ) _ the adopted chemical abundances .",
    "the ostar2002   grid allows us to study trends and to define the best strategy .",
    "the safest approach in limiting the role of other parameters consists in considering line ratios of two ( or more ) successive ionization stages of a given chemical element .",
    "therefore , we have mostly used the @xmath271176 to @xmath271169 ratio and iron ions as primary temperature diagnostics ( see also heap et  al .",
    "comparisons between photospheric ( tlusty ) and wind ( cmfgen ) models have also helped to estimate the effect of the stellar wind on temperature sensitive lines ; specific results are discussed in  [ resusect ] .",
    "the @xmath0   accuracy is typically of the order of several percent .",
    "usual spectroscopic diagnostics of @xmath26 are balmer line wings , most especially h@xmath28 .",
    "high accuracy determinations of @xmath26 which are required to derive accurate stellar masses are difficult to achieve .",
    "indeed , the line wings change relatively little compared to observational limitations ( nebular emission ; spectra with moderate signal - to - noise ratios ) .",
    "moreover , a strong stellar wind fills the balmer lines and thus results in underestimating the surface gravity @xcite .",
    "this later problem should however remain limited with weaker winds in low metallicity environments .",
    "we have thus always checked our initial estimates derived from tlusty   models with cmfgen fits to balmer lines .",
    "we stress finally that the _ effective gravity _ of the models is significantly lower than the real gravity because of the influence of the radiation pressure ( see fig .  3 in lanz & hubeny 2003b ) .",
    "the influence of centrifugal acceleration is however ignored , and hence the actual gravity is underestimated , particularly for fast stellar rotation .    a simultaneous fit of all and lines is almost never achieved ( see , e.g. , herrero et al . 1992 ; hillier et al .",
    "2003 ) , leaving significant uncertainties on helium abundance determinations .",
    "earlier studies systematically found enhanced helium abundances @xcite , while standard stellar evolution models ( without rotation ) do not predict such a surface enrichment for main - sequence o stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that consistent fits of the helium lines in o supergiants can be achieved when introducing a microturbulent velocity , helping to solve the `` helium discrepancy '' problem @xcite . in this study , we have adopted an helium abundance , @xmath29 , as in tlusty   ostar2002   grid , and we start the analysis assuming a microturbulent velocity , @xmath30 = 10kms@xmath5 .",
    "there is no indication of helium enrichment in our stellar sample .",
    "absolute visual magnitudes were calculated from the photometry in table  [ obsstis ] , assuming a distance modulus of 19.1mag ( i.e. , a distance of 66.1kpc ) for the smc following @xcite .",
    "our absolute magnitudes are slightly smaller than walborn , et al.s ( 2000 ) due to lower extinction derived from ostar2002   theoretical intrinsic colors ( typically , our color excesses are 0.02mag smaller ) .",
    "the stellar luminosities were then obtained applying a bolometric correction from @xcite .",
    "this ostar2002   relation , bc _ vs. _ @xmath0 , is very similar to the @xcite relation and to the empirical relation of @xcite .",
    "the derivation of stellar radii is then straightforward .",
    "we have used ostar2002   model atmospheres with @xmath31= 1/5 , and 1/10 , to determine the stellar metallicities , fitting the numerous iron lines in the uv spectrum .",
    "departures from scaled - solar abundances have been considered for carbon and nitrogen .",
    "we have recomputed model spectra with synspec   and cmfgen assuming different c and n abundances .",
    "oxygen abundances can not be derived reliably from our spectra : @xmath271338 - 43 strength is very sensitive to the adopted microturbulent velocity , and @xmath271371 is formed in the stellar wind . similarly to the lines , @xmath271502 is mostly useful to derive @xmath30 .",
    "we kept abundance ratios fixed to the same scaled - solar value for all other species included in the model atmospheres ( o , ne , si , p , s ) .      after the photospheric analysis , the parameter space left to explore is greatly reduced .",
    "using cmfgen , we derive in the next step the wind parameters ( namely , , @xmath20   and @xmath12 ) keeping @xmath0   within the error bars of the photospheric analysis .",
    "our analysis assumes an homogeneous wind and neglects clumping in the wind at the present stage .",
    "we will however comment further on this point in  [ discsect ] .",
    "initial estimates of the mass loss rates have been calculated with a theoretical formula from @xcite .",
    "the mass loss rates are adjusted until we match the observed spectra .",
    "the three stars with earlier spectral type exhibit p  cygni line profiles in the uv spectrum . the primary diagnostic lines available to determine the mass loss rate are the resonance doublet , the resonance doublet , and @xmath271371 .",
    "the lines are sensitive to the presence of shocks in the wind and a match to the line is often difficult to achieve .",
    "other potentially useful uv features are @xmath271176 , @xmath271338 - 43 , @xmath271640 , and @xmath271718 . in the optical ,",
    "we have recorded spectra around h@xmath11 for these three stars . in all cases",
    ", h@xmath11 is an absorption line which does not significantly depart from a pure photospheric profile .",
    "h@xmath11 and other uv lines help nevertheless to set limits on the mass loss rate .",
    "the spectrum of the three stars with a later spectral type , ngc 346 - 113 , ngc 346 - 487 , and ngc 346 - 12 , do not reveal any p  cygni line profiles , but only weak blue - shifted absorption in and resonance lines .",
    "we could then only establish upper limits on the mass - loss rate .",
    "simultaneously , we have to determine the exponent @xmath12 of the wind s velocity law .",
    "the predicted line profiles are quite sensitive to the density in the sonic region and thus depend on the adopted @xmath12 . for weak stellar winds , there is often a degeneracy in the determination of   and @xmath12 ( see also hillier et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we have adopted @xmath32 as the default value , but we have still explored cases of slightly different @xmath12 , @xmath33 .    apart from @xmath271240 in mpg  355 , our spectra do not reveal any saturated p  cygni lines to measure the wind terminal velocity , @xmath20 .",
    "following @xcite , we have thus used narrow absorption components seen in mpg  324 and in mpg  368 spectra to determine @xmath20 .",
    "we can only derive lower limits of the wind terminal velocity for the three other stars . the maximum turbulent velocity in the wind ( eq .  [ vturbeq ] ) is derived by fitting the blue edges of the p  cygni line profiles , while the minimum value has been set from the photospheric analysis .",
    "turbulence in the wind affects little the ionization structure of the models , and is only necessary to achieve a match to the observed profiles .",
    "we have adopted in a first step homogeneous wind models , but we have been unable to match some of the line profiles ( most notably , @xmath271371 , see  [ resusect ] ) .",
    "we have therefore examined the influence of clumping in a second stage .",
    "tlusty   spectra are convolved with a rotational profile and a gaussian instrumental profile in order to compare them with observed spectra .",
    "the projected rotational velocity @xmath34   is derived by matching relatively weak iron lines , as well as @xmath271176 , @xmath271338 - 43 , and @xmath271502 .",
    "the @xmath271176 multiplet is very useful because of its 6 close line components . in the stis spectra ,",
    "all stars but ngc  346 - 355 ( too hot to show strong lines ) show partial or fully resolved multiplet components , indicating moderate ( @xmath35kms@xmath5 ) to slow ( @xmath36kms@xmath5 ) rotational velocities . the projected rotational velocities are determined with a typical precision of @xmath3710kms@xmath5 .",
    "limited work exist so far on rotating stellar winds , because an exact calculation of line profiles formed in an extended wind requires multi - dimensional model atmospheres ( see , e.g. , petrenz & puls 1996 ) .",
    "convolution with an analytical profile is a reasonable approximation for photospheric lines only , as long as the rotational velocity does not approach the break - up velocity . in our case ,",
    "most lines are formed in the quasi - static photosphere or in the sonic region since the wind is relatively weak ( very few lines even show a p  cygni profile ) . moreover , rotational velocities remain small as indicated by the @xmath271176 multiplet .",
    "we believe therefore that we may apply a rotational convolution to observer s frame spectra calculated with cmfgen with a relative safety .",
    "the uv spectra reveal two sets of narrow interstellar absorption lines , from galactic and smc gas .",
    "a detailed modeling of these features is left to a future paper .",
    "however , we have added ly@xmath11 interstellar contribution to the theoretical spectra , in order to compare observed and predicted spectral features near ly@xmath11 ( e.g. , @xmath271206 , @xmath271240 ) . we have varied the column until a match to the observed ly@xmath11 profile is achieved .",
    "we discuss in this section the properties , the results and uncertainties of the analysis of each individual star .",
    "a general discussion about the sample as a whole , of the astrophysical significance of the results , and a comparison to theoretical predictions is left to the next section .",
    "this star has long been classified as an o3iii  ( ( f * ) ) star @xcite , based on the absence of @xmath274471 in its spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite have reexamined the earliest o - type stars and have introduced two new spectral classes , o2 and o3.5 , to distinguish stars having no or very weak @xmath274471 , but different lines .",
    "mpg  355 exhibits @xmath274603 - 19 in absorption , strong @xmath274058 in emission , and no @xmath274640 .",

    "least - squares fits through galactic supergiants and smc stars ( @xmath116 ) have a very similar slope , @xmath117 , and are comparable to a value derived by @xcite .",
    "the offset between the two relations can be interpreted as an effect of metallicity and implies , @xmath118 , with @xmath119 . allowing for a metallicity dependence of the wind terminal velocities , @xmath120 @xcite",
    ", we obtain a dependence of the mass loss rate ,  @xmath121 , which agrees well with theoretical expectations .",
    "however , we should point out that the galactic relation is established for supergiants , while the smc relation is based mostly on giants and dwarfs .",
    "the few galactic dwarfs fell clearly below the supergiant relation and , therefore , the difference in wind momentum between galactic and smc dwarfs is significantly reduced ( by a factor 2 at least ) . on the other hand , evolved smc stars like av  83 and av  69 have a wind momentum that is quite similar to these of galactic supergiants .",
    "a second interesting feature of the wlr is the steep turn at low luminosity ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "this behavior was already noticed by @xcite for a few galactic and smc stars , though the drop may start at higher luminosity at low metallicity .",
    "the three low luminosity stars in our sample confirm this steeper trend , as well as recent results in the star forming region n81 in the smc where low luminosity ovz stars reveal very weak wind signatures @xcite .",
    "this break in the wlr appears to be primarily related to the stellar luminosity , not to the effective temperature because low wind momentum spans a range in @xmath0 , from 45000 to 30000k .",
    "this break is therefore not related to bistability jumps that are predicted by vink et  al .",
    "( and references therein ) .",
    "they predict a jump around 35000k with an increase of the mass loss rate toward lower @xmath0 , albeit at metallicities much lower ( 1/30 solar ) than those considered here .",
    "we have also plotted wlr data for three early b supergiants with @xmath0  @xmath38 28000k @xcite .",
    "the o supergiant wlr can be extended to the lower luminosity , @xmath123 , for two of these b supergiants .",
    "this shows therefore a striking difference in the wind properties of early b supergiants and low luminosity o stars .",
    "a stronger wind might be driven by the b supergiants due to their lower surface gravity , @xmath124 , compared to o stars ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "cooler b supergiants ( @xmath0@xmath12625000k ) have a lower wind momentum because the wind is then driven by lines of another set of ions @xcite .",
    "we are currently obtaining stis spectra of b supergiants in the smc which will allow us to further study the wlr .",
    "other mechanisms might account for the weak winds that we observe .",
    "first , @xcite suggested that for stars with optically thin continuum near the sonic point , i.e stars with low luminosities and/or low metallicity , the velocity field in the sonic region is such that the line accelerations are significantly lower than previously considered in the sobolev formalism . as a consequence ,",
    "the wind properties are significantly modified , and mass - loss rates are smaller . furthermore ,",
    "investigating the instability caused by heavy ( minor ) ions runaway in low - density line - driven winds , @xcite have derived a scaling relation for the stellar winds parameters at which a decoupling between minor ions and the bulk of the hydrogen - helium wind can occur . applying this relation to our sample , we found that decoupling may indeed occur over most parts of the winds of mpg  12 , 487 , and 113 .      because the cmfgen models are fully line - blanketed , it is possible to check the consistency between the derived wind parameters ( , @xmath112 , and @xmath12 ) and the computed line force . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider two stars : mpg  113 and mpg  355 . to improve the accuracy of the line force calculations ,",
    "the models discussed here include ar , s , cl , and ni , in addition to the elements listed in table  [ atom_mod ] .    we have derived a very low mass loss rate (  @xmath75m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ) for mpg  113 , with inhomogeneous wind models having a mass loss rate a factor up to 10 lower . with the derived mass - loss rate(s ) the radiative acceleration is much larger than that required to drive the wind .",
    "this is verified even for a model in which we adopt ,  = @xmath127m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , @xmath128 , and @xmath112 = 2200kms@xmath5 . in this model ,",
    "the radiative acceleration is a factor of two too large in the outer region , and exceeds that required to drive the wind except for two depths near the sonic point .",
    "the discrepancy near the sonic point is not unusual ",
    "the radiation force is very sensitive to the velocity law and to the adopted microturbulent velocity in this region ( see a discussion in hillier et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "how can we resolve this wind - momentum discrepancy ?",
    "three solutions readily manifest themselves :    1 .",
    "there is a problem in the computed cmfgen ionization which affects the derived mass loss rates .",
    "this discrepancy could arise from several different sources including inaccurate atomic data , the influence of x - rays , and cmfgen s approximate treatment of clumping .",
    "we note ( sect .",
    "[ mpg355sect ] ) that many tests were performed to verify cmfgen , and no major changes in the derived mass loss rate was obtained .",
    "moreover , we note that the problem with fitting @xmath271371 has been a problem in all other wind calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   wind decoupling ( sect .",
    "[ decoupl ] ) .",
    "the adopted @xmath112   is too low . as noted ,",
    "@xmath112   can not be derived from the observations .",
    "if @xmath112   was much higher than 2000kms@xmath5 , the discrepancy might be lowered .    for mpg  355",
    ", @xmath112   is well determined , and the principal uncertainty in checking the hydrodynamics is the volume filling factor . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the radiation force is too low to drive the adopted mass loss rate throughout the entire wind .",
    "the line radiation force needs to be increased by 20 to 90% ( depth - dependent , and excluding the sonic region ) to drive the wind .    for @xmath128",
    ", there is a better agreement with the hydrodynamics , in general . in the outer region ,",
    "the line force is too small by 20% , while at @xmath130 it is 30% too large .",
    "given the uncertainties in the adopted velocity law and abundances , these differences are within expected errors , and could probably be remedied with slightly different but similar models .",
    "the line force is still much too small at the sonic point , but this is not surprising given the large adopted turbulent velocity , @xmath13125kms@xmath5 .    for @xmath115 ,",
    "the line force is larger than that required to drive the wind at all locations with @xmath13270kms@xmath5 . throughout the wind ,",
    "the line force is too large by at least a factor of two .",
    "we have not included ar , s , cl , and ni , in this model ; hence , a full model will show an even larger discrepancy .",
    "it is thus difficult to see how such a model could be adjusted to give consistency between both the observed spectrum and the wind hydrodynamics .",
    "we have analyzed the uv and optical spectrum of six young , massive o stars in ngc  346 , the largest region in the smc .",
    "we summarize here our main findings :    * similarly to several recent studies , we have derived lower effective temperatures than values obtained from a standard relation with the spectral type .",
    "this results in lower stellar luminosities and lower ionization fluxes from lower bolometric corrections . taking mpg  324 as an example ,",
    "the effective temperature is lowered from 48670k ( from o4v spectral type ) to 41500k , decreasing the luminosity by a factor 1.6 and the number of lyman continuum photons by a factor 2 . *",
    "some microturbulence is still required to match the uv metal lines .",
    "our analysis hints at a decrease of the microturbulent velocity from early to late o stars , from a value close to the sonic velocity down to a low value , 2 to 5kms@xmath5 . having set the microturbulence independently from uv metal lines , we are able to match the helium lines in the optical spectrum without requiring a surface enrichment .",
    "* most stars have a carbon abundance similar to the smc nebular abundance , but their surface is markedly enriched in nitrogen already during the ms phase . either , most are fast rotators viewed pole - on or mixing efficiency is underestimated by current evolutionary models . *",
    "young smc o stars have an overall metallicity , @xmath59 , that is consistent with evolved f - k supergiants . *",
    "the dependence of the mass loss rate with metallicity is consistent with a relation ,  @xmath91 , with @xmath133",
    ". a better characterization of @xmath96 requires larger stellar samples and detailed analysis of high - quality spectra .",
    "we have obtained very low mass loss rates for three stars , which can not be explain in the framework of radiative line - driven wind , but may indicate decoupling between hydrogen , helium , and metals , in the wind . @xcite",
    "predict significantly too high mass loss rates for smc and for lmc stars .",
    "use or extrapolation of their relations at sub - solar metallicities should be taken with caution . *",
    "homogeneous , smooth winds predict too strong @xmath61240 and @xmath61371 lines , suggesting that the winds of o dwarfs may be clumped or asymmetric , similarly to winds of o supergiants and wr stars . *",
    "finally , we have achieved a very good consistency between tlusty   and cmfgen models .",
    "this agreement demonstrates that we can use nlte photospheric , static model atmospheres to derive stellar parameters and abundances , even for the hottest o dwarfs with moderate winds (  @xmath38 few 10@xmath44m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , assuming @xmath32 ) .",

    "<S> we present the results of a detailed analysis of the properties of dwarf o - type stars in a metal - poor environment . high - resolution , </S>",
    "<S> high - quality , ultraviolet and optical spectra of six o - type stars in the region ngc 346 have been obtained from a spectroscopic survey of o stars in the smc . </S>",
    "<S> stellar parameters and chemical abundances have been determined using nlte line - blanketed photospheric models calculated with tlusty . additionally , we have modeled the spectra with the nlte line - blanketed wind code , cmfgen , to derive wind parameters . </S>",
    "<S> stellar parameters and chemical abundances , and in particular iron abundances , obtained with the two nlte codes compare quite favorably . </S>",
    "<S> this consistency demonstrates that basic photospheric parameters of main - sequence o stars can be reliably determined using nlte static model atmospheres . with the two nlte codes </S>",
    "<S> , we need to introduce a microturbulent velocity in order to match the observed spectra . our results hint at a decrease of the required microturbulent velocity from a value close to the sonic velocity in early o stars to a low value in late o stars . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to several recent studies of galactic , lmc and smc stars , we derive effective temperatures lower than predicted from the widely - used relation between spectral type and @xmath0 , resulting in lower stellar luminosities and lower ionizing fluxes . from evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram , </S>",
    "<S> we find an age of 3@xmath1 years for ngc  346 . </S>",
    "<S> a majority of the stars in our sample reveal cno - cycle processed material at their surface during the main - sequence stage , indicating thus fast stellar rotation and/or very efficient mixing processes . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an overall metallicity , @xmath2 , in good agreement with other recent analyses of smc stars . </S>",
    "<S> we study the dependence of the mass loss rate with the stellar metallicity and find a satisfactory agreement with recent theoretical predictions for three most luminous stars of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the wind - momentum luminosity relation for our sample stars derived for these stars agree with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the three other stars of our sample reveal very weak signatures of mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain mass loss rates that are significantly lower than 10@xmath3m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , which is below the predictions of radiative line - driven wind theory by an order of magnitude or more . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , evidence of clumping in the wind of main - sequence of o stars is provided by @xmath61371 . like previous studies of o star winds </S>",
    "<S> , we are unable to reproduce this line with homogeneous wind models , but we have achieved very good fits with clumped models . clumped wind models systematically yield lower mass loss rates than theoretical predictions . </S>"
