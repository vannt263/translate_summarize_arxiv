    "a precise determination of cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xcite is the most important goal of the forthcoming @xmath9-factories @xcite , cleo - iii , kek - b , slac - b , hera - b , lhc - b .",
    "their precise values are urgently needed for analyzing cp - violation and for testing the standard model ( sm ) through the unitarity relations among them @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the accurate knowledge of these matrix elements can be useful in relating them to the fermion masses and also in the searches for hints of new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "even precision measurements on top - physics will be affected , because the value of @xmath10 is related to @xmath0 through the unitary relation .",
    "the ckm matrix element @xmath0 is important to the sm description of cp - violation .",
    "if it were zero , there would be no cp - violation from the ckm matrix ( _ i.e. _ in the sm ) , and we have to seek for other sources of cp violation in @xmath11 .",
    "observations of semileptonic @xmath12 transitions by the cleo @xcite and argus @xcite imply that @xmath0 is indeed nonzero , and it is important to extract the modulus @xmath1 from semileptonic decays of @xmath9 mesons as accurately as possible .",
    "historically , the charged lepton energy spectrum ( @xmath13 ) has been measured , and the @xmath12 events are selected from the high end of the charged lepton energy spectrum .",
    "this method is applied to both inclusive and exclusive semileptonic @xmath9 decays .",
    "however , this cut on @xmath14 is not very effective , since only less than @xmath15 of @xmath12 events survive this cut at the @xmath9 meson rest frame .",
    "( in the future asymmetric @xmath9-factories with boosted @xmath9 mesons , much less than @xmath15 of @xmath12 events would survive the @xmath14 cut over the @xmath16 threshold . )",
    "we also note that the dependences of the lepton energy spectrum on perturbative and non - perturbative qcd corrections @xcite as well as on the unavoidable specific model parameters ( _ e.g. _ the parameter @xmath17 of the accmm model @xcite ) are strongest at the end - point region , which makes the model - independent determination of @xmath2 almost impossible from the inclusive distribution of @xmath13 .    for exclusive @xmath5 decays ,",
    "the application of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) is very much limited , since @xmath18-quark is not heavy compared to @xmath19 .",
    "and the theoretical predictions for the required hadronic matrix elements are largely different depending on which model we use , as can be seen in the following , as an example for @xmath20 ,    _ & [ eq1 ] + & =  8.3 10 ^ 12/sec  ,  ( @xcite ) + & = 32.9 10 ^ 12/sec  ,  ( @xcite ) + & = 18.7 10 ^ 12/sec  .",
    "( @xcite )    see also fig . 1 for the explicit model dependence on the value of @xmath21 .",
    "there are certainly many more available models than the listed above . and",
    "every one of them is based on a few reasonable assumptions . however , such assumptions of one model are in general exclusive to the assumptions of the other models , _",
    "e.g. _ monopole dominance or multipole dominance . and",
    "the usual practice of selecting a few models and averaging the few chosen results is physically groundless .",
    "these model dependences are not like the statistical errors .",
    "measurement of exclusive charmless semileptonic decays can put constraints on the models and therefore restrict the model dependence in principle , if the ratio of rates for @xmath22 and @xmath23 as well as the @xmath24 dependence of the form - factors are precisely measured .",
    "cleo has recently succeeded in measuring the branching ratio @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "a neutrino reconstruction technique is used : the neutrino energy and momentum are determined by evaluating the missing momentum and energy in the entire event :    e_miss & = 2e_beam-_ie_i , + _ miss & = _ i_i .",
    "more criteria are imposed to guard against events with false large missing energies : first , the net charge is required to be zero .",
    "secondly , events with two identified leptons ( implying two neutrinos ) are rejected .",
    "leptons are required to have momenta greater than 1.5 gev in the case of @xmath22 and greater than 2.0 gev in the case of @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the candidate neutrino mass is calculated as    m^2_=e^2_miss-^2_miss .",
    "candidate events containing a neutrino are kept if @xmath26 mev .",
    "then the semileptonic @xmath9 decay candidates ( @xmath27 are reconstructed using the neutrino four - vector found from the missing energy measurement .",
    "the beam constrained invariant mass , @xmath28 is defined as    m^2_cand = e^2_beam-(_+ _ + _ ( ) ) ^2    and with the use of the neutrino four - vector is essentially the same as any other full @xmath9 reconstruction analysis done at the @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is often difficult to prove that a @xmath30 system indeed is dominantly from resonant @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "cleo attempts to show @xmath31 dominance by plotting the @xmath32 and @xmath33 summed mass spectrum .",
    "they also show a test case of @xmath34 , which can not be @xmath31 , since @xmath35 can not decay to @xmath36 .",
    "there is an enhancement in the @xmath32 plus @xmath33 sum , while the @xmath36 shows a relatively flat spectrum that is explained by background .",
    "cleo proceeds by assuming they are seeing purely resonant decays in the vector channel .",
    "experimental importance here are that cleo - iii can be a powerful @xmath9-factory with possibly more than @xmath37 fully reconstructed semileptonic decay events .",
    "however , they have to find the way to avoid the most difficult problem ; the large model dependence for exclusive @xmath38 decays , as shown in eq . ( 1 ) , and as explained in previous section 2.1 .",
    "better options shown in following sections should be seriously pursued by cleo - iii experiment .",
    "\\(a ) the possibility of measuring @xmath1 via non - leptonic decays of @xmath9 mesons to exclusive two meson final states @xcite has been theoretically explored .",
    "to avoid the theoretical difficulties of non - spectator decay diagrams , only those final states must be chosen in which no quark and antiquark pair has the same flavor . within the factorization approximation and",
    "after considering the final state interactions , exclusive two body decay modes of @xmath9 mesons would certainly be worth of full investigation .",
    "\\(b ) it has also been suggested that the measurements of hadronic invariant mass spectrum @xcite as well as hadronic energy spectrum @xcite in the inclusive @xmath39 decays can be useful in extracting @xmath1 with better theoretical understandings .",
    "experimentally , the hadron energy spectrum in semileptonic @xmath9 decays may be measured schematically as follows @xcite : working at the @xmath29 resonance , which decays into @xmath40 , one requires one of the @xmath9-mesons to decay semileptonically and the other one hadronically . in the case of a symmetric @xmath9-factory , like cleo",
    ", the energy of the hadrons stemming from the semileptonically decaying @xmath9-meson can be obtained by measuring the total energy of all the hadrons in the final state and then subtracting @xmath41 . in case of asymmetric @xmath9 factories ,",
    "the hadron energy spectrum is harder to measure .",
    "one way is to reconstruct in a first step the whole @xmath29 decay in its rest frame and then perform the analysis just described for the symmetric case . after imposing a relatively high lower  cut at @xmath42 gev ( in order to avoid the region of phase space where the range in the invariant hadronic mass is too narrow to invoke quark - hadron duality ) , a much larger fraction ( @xmath43 ) of the @xmath44 events",
    "is captured in the remaining window @xmath45 than in the lepton spectrum endpoint analysis .",
    "\\(c ) the measurement of ratio @xmath46 from the differential decay widths of the processes @xmath47 and @xmath48 by using @xmath49-flavor symmetry and the heavy quark symmetry has been also proposed @xcite . then the ratio @xmath50 is extracted as    & [ eqn : main ] + _ q^2_max & / _ q^2_max .    in the limit @xmath51 , the @xmath24 distributions vanish due to the phase space suppression .",
    "in fact , cleo collaboration has rather accurately determined the value of @xmath52 for the process @xmath53 @xcite by extrapolating the @xmath24 distribution . in the similar manner , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : main ] ) can be determined by experiments .",
    "there has also been a recent theoretical progress on the exclusive @xmath38 semileptonic decay form factors using the hqet - based scaling laws to extrapolate the form factors from the semileptonic @xmath54 meson decays @xcite .",
    "\\(d ) it is urgently important that all the available methods have to be thoroughly explored to measure the most important ckm matrix element @xmath0 as accurately as possible in the forthcoming @xmath9-factories . in future asymmetric @xmath9-factories ( or in hadronic @xmath9-factories ) with microvertex detector , the hadronic invariant mass spectrum ( or ` @xmath7 ' , ` @xmath8 ' separation conditions ) offer alternative ways to select @xmath38 transitions that are much more efficient than selecting the upper end region of the lepton energy spectrum , with much less theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "then we can use the simple relation ,        where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be calculated model - independently within the hqet . however , we note that the individual exclusive decay width , @xmath58 @xmath21 or @xmath59 , can not be predicted model - independently , as shown in eq .",
    "( 1 ) and in fig .",
    "1 . we will give in more detail on this alternative method in the following section .",
    "over the past few years , a great progress has been achieved in our understanding of _ inclusive _ semileptonic decays of heavy mesons @xcite , especially in the lepton energy spectrum .",
    "however , it turns out that the end - point region of the lepton energy spectrum can not be described by @xmath60 expansion .",
    "rather , a partial resummation of @xmath60 expansion is required @xcite , closely analogous to the leading twist contribution in deep inelastic scattering , which could bring about significant uncertainties and presumable model dependences .",
    "even with a theoretical breakdown near around the end - point region of lepton energy spectrum , accurate prediction of the * total * integrated semileptonic decay rate can be obtained @xcite within the hqet including the first non - trivial non - perturbative corrections as well as radiative perturbative qcd correction @xcite . the related uncertainties in calculation of the integrated decay rate",
    "have been also analyzed @xcite .",
    "the total inclusive semileptonic decay rate for @xmath61 is given as    ( b & x_q l ) = g_f^2 m_b^5 192 ^3 |v_qb|^2 [ eq2 ] + \\ { ( 1 - _ ^2 - _ g^2 2 m_b^2 ) + & - z_1(x_q ) _",

    "the expectation value of energy due to the chromomagnetic hyperfine interaction , @xmath63 , can be related to the @xmath64 mass difference    _",
    "g^2 = 3 4 ( m_b^*^2 - m_b^2 ) ( 0.35 0.005 ) gev^2 [ eq4 ]    and the expectation value of kinetic energy of @xmath65-quark inside the @xmath9 meson , @xmath66 , is given from various arguments @xcite ,    0.1  gev^2 _ ^2 0.7  gev^2 , [ eq5 ]    which shows much larger uncertainties compared to @xmath67 . the value of @xmath68 has been estimated @xcite from the total decay rate @xmath69 of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) by using the pole mass of @xmath70 and a mass difference @xmath71 based on the hqet . as can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the @xmath72 factor , which appears in the semileptonic decay rate , but not in the branching fraction , is the largest source of the uncertainty , resulting in about @xmath73 error in the prediction of @xmath68 via the semileptonic branching fraction and @xmath9 meson life time @xcite .",
    "historically , the accmm model @xcite was motivated to avoid this @xmath72 factor , and at the same time to naively incorporate the bound state effect of initial @xmath9 meson .",
    "we can do a similar exercise to predict the value of @xmath1 from the integrated total decay rate of @xmath74 , to find out     \\ { + & ( 1 - _ ^2 - _ g^2 2 m_b^2 ) - _",

    "we use the pole mass of @xmath65-quark @xmath75 gev from a qcd sum - rule analysis of the @xmath76-system @xcite . to be conservative ,",
    "we use here a larger error bar ( larger by a factor 8) than that of the original analysis @xcite .",
    "we estimate the largest possible error of @xmath70 as @xmath77 . and",
    "@xmath78 and we take @xmath79 . [ extrapolating the known 5 % error of @xmath80 , we estimate about 10 % error for @xmath81 . ]",
    "we get numerically    _ u & + & ( 7.1 1.5 ) 10 ^ 13/sec ,    and     & ^1/2 ^1/2 .",
    "as previously explained , the largest uncertainty comes from the factor @xmath72 , which gives the most part of the theoretical errors shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "we remark that the semileptonic branching fraction of @xmath38 decay , @xmath82 , has to be precisely measured to experimentally determine the value of @xmath1 from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss on the experimental possibilities in details in the next section .",
    "once the inclusive branching fraction @xmath82 is precisely measured , we can extract the value of @xmath1 within the theoretical error ( @xmath83 ) similar to those of @xmath68 .",
    "( compare the inclusive @xmath84 of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and the exclusive @xmath85 of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for the theoretical predictions of the semileptonic @xmath38 decay . )    the ratio of ckm matrix elements @xmath2 can be determined in a model - independent way by taking the ratio of semileptonic decay widths @xmath86 .",
    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , this ratio is theoretically described by the phase space factor and the well - known perturbative qcd correction only ,    ( b x_u l ) ( b x_c l ) & | v_ub v_cb |^2 + & ^-1 , [ eq7 ]    where we ignored the term @xmath87 , which gives about 1 % correction to the ratio .",
    "we strongly emphasize here that the sources of the main theoretical uncertainties , the most unruly factor @xmath72 and the still - problematic non - perturbative contributions , are all canceled out in this ratio . by taking @xmath79 , and by using the mass difference relation from the hqet @xcite , which gives @xmath88 .",
    "[ this ratio @xmath89 is calculable from the mass difference @xmath90 , which also includes the uncertain parameter @xmath66 of eq .",

    "the ratio of the semileptonic decay widths is estimated as    ( b x_u l ) ( b x_c l ) & ( _ u _ c ) | v_ub v_cb |^2 [ eqq8 ] + & ( 1.83 0.28 ) | v_ub v_cb |^2 ,    and the ratio of ckm elements is     & ( 0.74 0.06 ) ^1/2 .",
    "once the ratio of semileptonic decay widths ( or equivalently the ratio of branching fractions @xmath91 ) is measured in the forthcoming asymmetric @xmath9-factories , this should give a powerful model - independent determination of @xmath2 .",
    "there is absolutely no theoretical model dependence in these ratios , eqs .",
    "( [ eq7],[eqq8],[eq8 ] ) .",
    "as explained earlier , for example , in the accmm model @xcite the model dependence comes in via the introduction of the parameter @xmath17 in place of the factor @xmath72 , which is now canceled in these ratios .",
    "we also note that by using the integrated total decay widths , instead of the lepton energy spectrum , another possible model dependence related to the end point region of the spectrum need not be even introduced .      as explained in the previous section , in order to measure @xmath2 ( and @xmath1 ) model - independently by using the relations eqs .",
    "( [ eq6],[eq8 ] ) , it is experimentally required to separate the @xmath38 semileptonic decays from the dominant @xmath16 semileptonic decays , and to precisely measure the branching fraction @xmath82 or the ratio @xmath91 . at presently existing symmetric @xmath9-experiments , argus and cleo , where @xmath9 and @xmath92 are produced almost at rest",
    ", this required separation is possible only in the very end - point region of the lepton energy spectrum , because both @xmath9 and @xmath92 decay into the whole @xmath93 solid angle from the almost same decay point , and it is not possible to identify the parent @xmath9 meson of each produced particle .",
    "hence all the hadronic information is of no use .",
    "however , in the forthcoming asymmetric @xmath9-experiments with microvertex detectors , babar and belle @xcite , where the two beams have different energies and the produced @xmath29 is not at rest in the laboratory frame , the bottom decay vertices will be identifiable .",
    "the efficiency for the full reconstruction of each event could be relatively high limited only by the @xmath94-reconstruction efficiency of about @xmath95 @xcite , and this @xmath38 separation would be experimentally viable .    as of the most straightforward separation method",
    ", the measurements of inclusive hadronic invariant mass ( @xmath96 ) distributions in @xmath97 can be very useful for the fully reconstructed semileptonic decay events .",
    "for @xmath16 decays , one necessarily has @xmath98 gev .",
    "therefore , if we impose a condition @xmath99 , the resulting events come only from @xmath38 decays , and about 90% of the @xmath12 events would survive this cut .",
    "this is already in sharp contrast with the usual cut on charged lepton energy @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , one can relax the condition @xmath99 , and extract almost the total @xmath38 semileptonic decay rate @xcite , because the @xmath96 distribution in @xmath16 decays is completely dominated by contributions of three resonances @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which are essentially like @xmath102-functions ,    d d m__x = ( br",
    "l )   ( m__x - m__r )  , [ eq9 ]    where the resonance @xmath103 or @xmath101 .",
    "1 . in other words ,",
    "one is allowed to use the @xmath38 events in the region even above @xmath104 , first by excluding small regions in @xmath96 around @xmath105 , and then by including the regions again numerically in the @xmath96 distribution of @xmath38 decay from its values just around the resonances .",
    "there still is a non - resonant decay background at large invariant - mass region @xmath106 from @xmath107 in using this inclusive @xmath96 distribution separation .",
    "however , with an additional ` @xmath7 ' separation condition , which we explain later , this many - pion producing @xmath38 decay could be safely differentiated from the non - resonant @xmath16 semileptonic decays . instead of using the `",
    "@xmath7 ' separation , if we impose a condition @xmath108 , we would get about 95% of the total @xmath12 events .",
    "we note that there is possibly a question of bias .",
    "some classes of final states ( @xmath58 those with low multiplicity , few neutrals ) may be more susceptible to a full and unambiguous reconstruction .",
    "hence an analysis that requires this reconstruction may be biased .",
    "however , the use of topological information from microvertex detectors should tend to reduce the bias , since vertex resolvability depends largely on the proper time of the decay and its orientation relative to the initial momentum ( that are independent of the decay mode ) .",
    "also such a bias can be allowed for in the analyses , via a suitable monte carlo modeling . for more details on this inclusive hadronic invariant mass distribution @xmath109 ,",
    "please see ref .",
    "@xcite .    even without full reconstructions of all the final particles , one can",
    "separate @xmath38 decays from @xmath16 decays by using the particle decay properties @xcite .",
    "since @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the semileptonic @xmath16 decays always produce at least one final state @xmath54 meson , compared to @xmath38 decays which produce particles , @xmath112 that always decay to one or more @xmath113 mesons at the end .",
    "therefore , the @xmath38 decay separation could be achieved better with the accurate ` @xmath7 ' separation in particle detectors , and if combined with the hadronic invariant - mass distribution separation .",
    "such ` @xmath7 ' separations would be possible via partial reconstructions of a whole event or by using special event characteristics , rather than by fully reconstructing a whole event . in order for this ` @xmath7 ' separation to be successfully implemented , one should have the separation with better than about 98 % efficiency , because of @xmath114 .",
    "we can also think of ` @xmath8 ' separation as a natural extension , because the semileptonic @xmath16 decays always produce at least one final state @xmath115 meson .",
    "these ` @xmath7 ' ( and ` @xmath8 ' ) separation conditions are also applicable at the hadronic @xmath9-factories , hera - b , lhc - b .",
    "there possibly is a source of background to this ` @xmath7 ' separation condition from the cascade decay of @xmath116 .",
    "recently argus and cleo @xcite have separated this cascade decay background from the signal events to extract the model - independent spectrum of @xmath117 for the whole region of electron energy , by taking care of lepton charge and @xmath118 mixing systematically . in the future asymmetric @xmath9-factories with much higher statistics , this cascade decay may not be any serious background at all except for the case with very low energy electron production .",
    "the precise value of @xmath0 is urgently needed for understanding the origin of cp - violation , for testing the sm through the unitarity relations among them , and also in the searches for hints of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "we propose that the ratio of ckm matrix elements @xmath2 can be determined in a model - independent way by taking the ratio of semileptonic decay widths @xmath86 , which is theoretically described by the phase space factor and the well - known perturbative qcd correction only , and which predicts          based on the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "once the ratio of semileptonic decay widths ( or equivalently the ratio of branching fractions @xmath91 ) is measured , this ratio will give a powerful model - independent determination of @xmath2 .",
    "in the forthcoming asymmetric @xmath9-factories with microvertex detectors , the total separation of @xmath38 semileptonic decays from the dominant @xmath16 semileptonic decays to determine the ratio would be experimentally viable .",
    "we explore the possible experimental options : the measurement of inclusive hadronic invariant mass distributions , and the ` @xmath7 ' ( and ` @xmath8 ' ) separation conditions .",
    "we also clarify the relevant experimental backgrounds . in view of the potential importance of @xmath119 as a new theoretically model - independent probe for measuring @xmath2",
    ", we would like to urge our experimental colleagues to make sure that this @xmath38 separation can indeed be successfully achieved .",
