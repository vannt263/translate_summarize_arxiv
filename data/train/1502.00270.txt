    "advances in deep tissue optical microscopy have been a driving force in biology and neuroscience for the last twenty years .",
    "two - photon excited fluorescence microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to study synaptic , cellular and integrative processes . however , scattering in neural tissues has limited optical imaging to superficial cortex layers only  even after surgical removal of the skull @xcite .",
    "deeper cortical layers ( layers 4 to 6 ) are of substantial biological interest due to their interactions with other brain regions such as the thalamus @xcite .",
    "together with subcortical structures , e.g , the hippocampus , they still remain inaccessible without removing the overlying tissue .",
    "thus , even small improvements in imaging depth and resolution are bound to reveal novel insights on the functioning of mammalian brains .",
    "efforts to increase the penetration depth of optical techniques have aimed to improve the quantity and focusing of ballistic photons by using regenerative amplifiers @xcite , longer wavelength lasers @xcite and adaptive optics @xcite as well as enhancing the collection of fluorescence photons @xcite .",
    "those efforts commonly sacrifice intensity in favor of resolution as the number of ballistic photons decreases exponentially with imaging depth . in an alternative approach , multiply scattered light itself can be used for imaging @xcite .",
    "recently , the ` optical memory effect ' @xcite has emerged as a powerful tool to either enable the reconstruction of images from scattered light or to accelerate the imaging process@xcite .",
    "in essence , the memory effect ( me ) describes an intrinsic isoplanatism of the scattering process for small angles even in strongly scattering media . by tilting the wavefront incident on a scattering medium , the emerging speckle patterns shifts accordingly and does not immediately decorrelate .",
    "this isoplanatism can be exploited for adaptive optics imaging techniques .",
    "spatial modulation of the incident wavefront permits focusing behind or inside turbid media if the transmission matrix is accessible ( e.g. , by placing a point source or detector behind the scattering layer ) @xcite .",
    "since this comes at the cost of determining the transmission matrix for each image point , the me plays a key role : if a focus is achieved , it can then be scanned over the me range by simply introducing a linear phase tilt in the modulated wavefront @xcite .    in a more recent approach , a light - emitting object hidden behind an opaque layer",
    "is numerically reconstructed from its transmitted speckle pattern @xcite . due to the me ,",
    "the autocorrelation of the speckle pattern is essentially equal to the object s autocorrelation and numerical inversion yields the object itself .",
    "this method is both non - invasive and does not require sophisticated imaging equipment but its field of view is intrinsically limited by the me range .",
    "albeit important for imaging , the me is in theory very limited and scales inversely with the thickness @xmath1 of the medium .",
    "furthermore , in theory , it can not be observed _ inside _ a scattering medium where the concept of isoplanatism breaks down , but only in transmission at a distance from the output plane .",
    "this can be understood when considering a tilt of the incident wavefront , i.e. , the introduction of a linear phase gradient .",
    "the me effect states that such a gradient , if sufficiently small , is preserved during the scattering process and results in the same linear phase gradient imposed on the emerging distorted wavefront .",
    "this gradient at the output plane then becomes a shift of the speckle pattern only after propagation through space .",
    "we thus expect to see the same decorrelation with the tilt of incident angle of the intensity pattern at the output plane itself but without the shift that is useful for imaging .",
    "recent work in biomedical imaging with adaptive optics @xcite suggests otherwise : phase corrections compensating for random scattering remain valid for a field - of - view of several microns inside brain tissues .",
    "this paper investigates how strong forward scattering inside biological media provides a much larger me range that predicted by multiply scattering theory , in particular at intermediary depths of @xmath01 mm .",
    "complementing angular correlation measurements in neural tissues , we simulate the impact of anisotropic scattering on wave propagation through multiple forward scattering layers and qualitatively reproduce the experimental results .",
    "in the limit of weak disorder @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the wavelength and @xmath4 the mean free path ( mfp ) , the me is well described by a first order approximation to ensemble averaged correlations in the intensity transmission matrix . in a medium",
    "much thicker than the mfp ( @xmath5 ) the correlation @xmath6 obeys @xcite @xmath7 when following a tilt @xmath8 in both the incident wavefront and the emerging speckle pattern ( @xmath9 denotes the wave number ) . as a figure of merit , we chose the angular difference @xmath10 at which the correlation drops to 1/5 , the value at which visual resemblance to the reference image vanishes .",
    "this me range scales linearly with the wavelength and is inversely proportional to the sample thickness :    @xmath11    note that eq .",
    "( 1 ) does not depend on the specific realization of the material such as the location of scatters or the transport mean free path so long as photons are scattered multiple times before reaching the output plane @xmath5 . for a sample thickness of @xmath12 mm and a wavelength of 532 nm ,",
    "the speckle correlation already drops to 1/5 at an angular shift of 11.5mdeg .    .scattering properties of in - vivo and ex - vivo cortex tissues at different wavelengths .",
    "values are obtained from references in the last column and values in parenthesis are deduced from the experimental data with ( a ) @xmath13 at 532 nm and @xmath14 for @xmath15 nm @xcite , ( b ) by extrapolating the fit in @xcite up to 800 nm and ( c ) by neglecting water absorption . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for chicken muscle tissue , a tmfp of @xmath16 ( mfp , @xmath17 ) and an anisotropy factor of @xmath18 have been measured @xcite .",
    "our sample thicknesses were chosen to range from less than one @xmath19 to above @xmath20 .",
    "but due to the inherent inhomogeneity of biological tissues , those values are likely to fluctuate both within and between samples .",
    "this becomes evident when comparing the and slices : although the thickness increases , we observe that the me ranges slightly decreases .",
    "keeping this variability in mind , there is still a clear trend emerging from the chicken breast measurements .",
    "the me range is up to 35 times larger than expected for isotropic scattering but this difference decreases to a factor of 5 for the thickest sample .",
    "eventually , it is expected to vanish entirely for samples much thicker than @xmath19 , i.e. , in the cm range .",
    "in addition to the extended me range , we also observe a deviation from the theoretical @xmath21 bell shape of angular correlation curves towards a more exponential shape .",
    "for the thickest sample however , the ideal theory shape is recovered .    .",
    "thickness values have an uncertainty of @xmath22% from variations in the tmfp .",
    "simulated values are shown as black circles with simulated ratio of 1.08 at @xmath23 ( outside the plotted range ) .",
    ", width=377 ]    a similar picture emerges from the rat cortex samples .",
    "two series of cortex slices were prepared to account for brain layers with different properties .",
    "the first series starts at the cortex surface ( layer 1 ) and is labeled ` top ' in table [ tab2 ] while the second starts at the cortex middle ( label ` mid ' ) and the thickest sample consists of an entire flattened cortex . with a smaller tmfp of @xmath24 @xcite in rat cortices , all of our samples are thicker than @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , we observe the same qualitative differences in me shape and range as for chicken tissue .",
    "we recover the ideal theory shape for angular correlation curves for the two thicker samples and at a thickness of @xmath25 , the experimental me range is only twice as big as the theory value .    the change in me curve shape indicates that the additional correlations are of a different nature than in the conventional me . in multiply scattering media",
    ", the me emerges from correlations between the input and output positions for light : a pencil beam incident on a thin slab spreads through the medium and emerges as a diffuse spot at the output plane , or a size roughly given by the thickness , but with a total loss of the incident direction .",
    "it corresponds to a macroscopic structure in the transmission matrix , with larger transmission amplitudes close to the diagonal in position space@xcite .",
    "but in case of strong forward scattering and a sample thickness close to the tmfp , the direction of wave propagation is not completely randomized when passing through the sample . instead , as judkewitz et al .",
    "argue @xcite , one input mode in k - space is transmitted only to a narrow cone of output directions around the incident k , thereby giving the transmission matrix a similar structure with large near - diagonal amplitudes in k - space .",
    "they derive translational ( instead of angular ) correlations arising from that k - space structure , even for a negligible traditional me , i.e. , for very thick slabs . in practice for our sample ,",
    "we expect those correlations to contribute to the angular me in forward scattering tissues as well .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have neglected the effects of absorption on the me .",
    "in fact , absorption does increase angular correlations by narrowing the diffusive cone that would emerge from a pencil beam ( larger near - diagonal amplitudes in the real space transmission matrix ) .",
    "van rossum and nieuwenhuizen @xcite derived a modified version of eq .",
    "( 1 ) depending on the absorption coefficient @xmath26 but resulting increases in correlation are very small even for strongly absorbing materials with @xmath27 and retain the shape of eq .",
    "therefore , we can safely exclude absorption effects as the origin of larger correlations .",
    "another question is whether correlations observed in the far field are retained close to the output plane where only a fraction of the scattered amplitudes contribute to the interference pattern .",
    "this is of special interest for imaging inside biological tissues where we ideally would like to scan a focus or exploit the memory effect inside a medium .",
    "we mimicked a ` near field ' situation by placing a diaphragm immediately behind the sample output plane .",
    "resulting correlations in the far field speckles thus correspond to angular correlations at the aperture .",
    "the obtained correlation curves were indeed the same as without diaphragm ( fig .",
    "however , in a strongly multiple scattering sample , we do not expect an actual shift of the output plane intensity pattern since the me relies on well - defined output modes in k - space .",
    "instead , we would expect a mere decorrelation that only becomes a shift in the far field . while this control experiment is not a definite confirmation that me is present inside tissues",
    ", we believe the combination of lower effective thicknesses together with the presence of translational invariance as measured in @xcite is in agreement with the experimental observation of the me inside tissues exploited in @xcite for imaging .",
    "from a random phase mask . the resulting scattering angle @xmath28 is determined by the phase mask gradient .",
    "( c ) simulated angular correlation curves in the weak forward scattering regime .",
    "the sample consists of two phase masks with a distance of @xmath29 and @xmath30-factors from 0.7 - 0.98.,width=377 ]    to confirm the scattering anisotropy as cause for a longer me range , we aim to reproduce the impact of larger g - values on correlation curves in a multiple scattering simulation .",
    "again , we are especially interested in optically thin samples with predominant forward scattering and therefore model the scattering process with a number of consecutive phase masks ( fig .",
    "each of those phase masks @xmath31 is created from a random matrix by multiplying its fourier spectrum with a 2d gaussian function and thus determining the frequencies of its spatial fluctuations . by changing the gaussian s width",
    ", we change the scattering angles @xmath28 and thus the @xmath30-factor via ( fig .",
    "4b )    @xmath32    at a phase mask @xmath33 , the scalar electric field @xmath34 accumulates a phase of @xmath35 and we use the rayleigh - sommerfeld equation @xcite , an extract solution to the scalar helmholtz equation , for light propagation .",
    "there are two obvious shortcomings of this simplified model : first , phase masks allow for forward scattering only and all back scattering is thus assumed to be negligible and second , scattering events take place only at certain planes unlike the reality of randomly distributed scatters with anisotropies on a large range of length scales @xcite .",
    "we trade accuracy for shorter computation times but nevertheless are able to control mfp ( distance between phase masks ) , @xmath30-factor and tmfp of the scattering process .    keeping the above in mind",
    ", we still see good qualitative agreement in both me range and curve shape .",
    "we simulated correlation curves for anisotropy factors from 0.70 - 0.98 while keeping all remaining parameters fixed .",
    "as expected , we see the strongest impact of g on correlation curves in case of only a few scattering events and strong forward scattering ( fig . 4 c , d ) .",
    "we qualitatively reproduce the curve shape for high @xmath30-values and retrieve the bell - like shape from multiple theory at lower @xmath30-values . in a second series of simulations",
    ", we kept the mfp ( distance between phase masks ) fixed at while varying the total sample thickness from  @xmath36 to @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting me ranges are shown in fig . 3d together with experimental values .",
    "as expected , the ratio between simulated forward scattering and theoretical multiple scattering me range again increases with thinner samples .",
    "however , the simulation somewhat underestimates the impact of anisotropy and @xmath37 is uniformly bigger than the simulated values .",
    "this comes as a surprise since we expect the exclusion of backward scattering to produce stronger correlations .",
    "the discrepancy might originate from the discrete scattering planes in our model .",
    "usually , distances between scattering events are distributed around the mfp and some photons undergo less scattering events than others ( ` snake photons ' ) .",
    "the phase mask simulation assumes the same number of scattering events for all photons and might thus reduce speckle correlations .",
    "even though angular correlations are underestimated , we can still qualitatively reproduce the cusped curve shape for weak forward scattering in thin slices together with the transition to the theory shape of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for stronger scattering in thicker samples .",
    "several emerging imaging techniques for scattering media rely on angular correlations of the transmitted light @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that anisotropic scattering can extend the range of this optical memory effect by more than an order of magnitude when propagation through tissues .",
    "both the experiments and our phase mask simulation show that the preservation of directionality during scattering results in correlations that become visible in the distinct exponential like shape of angular correlation curves . from our measurements on chicken and rat tissues , we expect that diffraction - limited imaging with a field - of - view of 50 - 100mdeg through a tissue layer of 1 mm should be possible at wavelength of 533 nm .",
    "the me range scales linearly with @xmath3 and the tmfp is known to increase by factor of 5 - 10 in the near infrared and for in - vivo compared to in - vitro slices ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . at common wavelengths used in two - photon fluorescence microscopy , the me range should increase accordingly .",
    "further improvements might be achieved through several methods .",
    "first , translational correlations that arise from anisotropic scattering @xcite could well be exploited together with temporal and spectral correlation alongside the traditional angular me to further increase the field - of - view .",
    "second , we have seen that the me is strongest for photons that have undergone only a limited number of scattering events . combining traditional gating techniques that only retain snake photons @xcite with imaging processes that use scattered light",
    "should yield further improvements for both field - of - view and imaging depth .    with an emerging better understanding of speckle correlations in anisotropic media ,",
    "we expect imaging techniques that utilize scattered photons to become far more powerful for applications in biological imaging or photostimulation .",
