    "the focus now turns to analyses whose aim is to disentangle the potential signal originating from the cme , from the background . for the latter",
    ", it was recently realised that the biggest contributor is the effect of local charge conservation coupled to elliptic flow modulations @xcite .",
    "one way to probe the background contribution is to study the charge dependent correlations relative to the fourth harmonic symmetry plane i.e. the so  called double harmonic correlator @xmath40 . the contribution from the cme is argued to be little , if any at all ( i.e. correlations relative to @xmath45 ) , while the background should create a charge dependent signal albeit scaled compared to the previous case ( i.e. @xmath39 , the so  called single harmonic correlator ) by the ratio of @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] presents the centrality dependence of the differences between the correlations of unlike and like  sign pairs for both the single ( i.e. red points ) and the double harmonic ( i.e. blue points ) correlators . while the single harmonic correlator exhibits a rather strong charge dependent signal",

    "this could be interpreted as an indication that the effect of local charge conservation and its interplay with azimuthal anisotropy might not contribute significantly in these measurements . however , before reaching a final conclusion , a measurement of better precision needs to be performed from the experimental side , while there is an increasing need for these effects to be studied thoroughly from the theory side e.g. using models that can describe both the hydrodynamical evolution of the system but also its final state , hadronic interactions .",
    "the study of angular correlations in pb  pb provided valuable information on the expansion of the system , driven by initial pressure gradients . during this phase it behaves as a liquid with low dissipation values .",
