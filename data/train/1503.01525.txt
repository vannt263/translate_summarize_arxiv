    "silicon photomultipliers ( sipm s , mppc s ) are the arrays of avalanche photodiodes operating in a geiger mode . their high gain , high detection efficiency and compact sizes in conjunction with very high pulse height resolution enabling photon counting make them very attractive candidates for replacement of the traditional photomultipliers , pmts , especially in applications where the total area of photodetectors required is small .",
    "sipm s offer several advantages over the pmt tubes but they also present new challenges related to solid state nature of these devices . thermally generated free charge carriers create signals identical to those caused by photoelectrons , hence the dark count rates in typical devices are relatively large , in the range @xmath0@xcite .",
    "large number of carriers are present in the geiger discharge ; some of them may be trapped in metastable traps .",
    "their subsequent release may produce additional pulses , afterpulses , which contribute to the observed signal .",
    "the stochastic nature of this process affects the performance of photodetectors .",
    "afterpulsing is a result of a large number of independent events ( electron traversing the junction ) hence it can be well modelled using standard statistical methods . in principle",
    "one can derive any observable quantity or distribution by a suitable convolution of poisson and exponential distributions with the mean values and lifetimes appropriate for a detector in question .",
    "we have calculated these convolutions using monte carlo integration and generating 50 million initial afterpulses .",
    "afterpulses can be characterized in terms of the probability that a given pulse will produce a subsequent afterpulse and their time constant @xmath1 . in this note",
    "the @xmath2 will be used to denote the average number of trapped electrons ( hence the number of afterpulses produced by a single pulse , not counting the next generation of afterpulses ) .",
    "for @xmath3 it has the meaning of the actual probability of producing an afterpulse .",
    "these parameters depend on the operating point of the sipm .",
    "increase of the bias voltage @xmath4 leads to corresponding increase of the @xmath2 because of the increase of the number of charge carriers in the avalanche @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the cell capacitance and the @xmath7 is the breakdown voltage , and the simultaneous increase of the probability that a free charge carrier will initiate an avalanche , @xmath8 . the afterpulsing time constant @xmath1 may depend on the temperature of the photodetector .    in general there might be several trapping levels present with different trapping probabilities and corresponding time constants . in the following",
    "we explore a simple model of one trapping level with a single afterpulsing probability and one time constant .",
    "afterpulsing is a stochastic process , the actual number of additional pulses undergoes fluctuations according to the poisson distribution with @xmath2 being the expectation value . in the note the quantity @xmath2 will be referred to as afterpulsing probability. every afterpulse produces a standard avalanche , hence it may lead to a production of additional afterpulses .    in a realistic detector",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated as the bias voltage after an avalanche drops to @xmath7 and is being restored with the time constant @xmath9 characteristic for a given device .",
    "electrons released from the traps at timescales shorter than @xmath9 have lower probability of producing an avalanche because of reduced @xmath8 and the charge of the avalanche will be reduced proportionally to the actual value of overvoltage , @xmath10 .",
    "the latter effect will lead to a reduced afterpulsing probability @xmath2 of the subsequent afterpulses regardless of their timing .",
    "these effects depend on the specific devices and they are ignored in the present study .",
    "afterpulsing is simulated assuming a single avalanche creating a poisson - distributed number of afterpulses distributed with the exponential decay time . the procedure is iteratively applied to each of the generated afterpulses , thus leading to trains of pulses with varying numbers of pulses and their time distributions .",
    "afterpulsing with fixed probability would lead to an increase of the number of pulses by an additional contribution of @xmath11 and it may be treated as an additional gain factor , albeit dependent on the bias voltage . as shown in fig.[fig : no_of_afterpulses ] the same is true even in the case when the afterpulses are created with fluctuations governed by the poisson statistics .",

    "such a method would yield a correct result in the case when the number of afterpulses to a given pulse is one .",

    "the apparent raise of the instantaneous rate is a reflection of the lack of afterpulses corresponding to thermal pulses produced at @xmath24 .",
    "the time interval required to reach the asymptotic level in such a situation depends on the interplay of the afterpulsing time constant and the afterpulsing probability .",
    "in the presence of afterpulses the observed dark pulse rate is an overestimate of the rate of random thermal excitations by a factor @xmath16 which can exceed an order of magnitude .",
    "a better estimate of the initial thermal rate can be obtained from a distribution of pulses multiplicity in some time interval @xmath25 .",
    "the probability of observation of zero pulses @xmath26 in the given time interval provides an estimate of the average number of pulses expected in this time interval @xmath27 if there were no thermal pulses in the specific time interval then there will be no afterpulses either , therefore such method appears to be systematically superior to the use of the raw observed rate .",
    "a possible presence of the afterpulse to the pulses preceding the time interval in question reduces the probability of observing zero pulses and biases the resulting @xmath28 towards the higher values , however . to study the resulting bias the random thermal pulses corresponding to the rate of @xmath29",
    "were generated in the time interval of @xmath30 with afterpulses corresponding to the time constant @xmath31 of @xmath20 . to avoid an additional bias due to the imperfection of the simulation at the beginning of the simulated time interval",

    "absolute calibration of photodetectors , i.e. conversion of the observed signals into the number of photons impacting the photodetector , is the crucial step in several classes of experiments .",
    "one of they methods successfully used with photomultipliers involves illumination of the photodetector with a light signals of constant intensity and determination of the average number of photons impacting the photodetector from the width of the observed pulse height distribution using the eq .",
    "[ eq : absolute_cal ] @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean value of the measured distribution of signals and @xmath37 is the width of this distribution .",
    "this method relies on the assumption that the variation of the observed signal is dominated by the poisson fluctuations of the number of detected photons .",

    "afterpulsing is an intrinsic feature of sipm - type photodetectors and it does contribute to the various factors relevant to the performance of these photodetectors .",
    "the afterpulsing probability is proportional to the overvoltage , hence many of the observed characteristics of the sipms depend on the bias voltage .",
    "a simplified model of afterpulsing gives and explanation of a rapid increase of dark count rate ( or a dark current ) with the bias voltage and , at the same time , it predicts a serious deterioration of the intrinsic resolution of the detectors .",
    "the observable timing characteristics of sipms depend on the bias voltage as longer and longer trains of afterpulses are generated with the increasing voltage .",
    "various methods of the experimental determination of the true underlying dark count rates and/or absolute calibration are affected by the afterpulsing and therefore their outcome depend on the operating point of the devices .",
    "knowledege of afterpulsing level can be used to derive the corrections to determine the underlying values of these parameters",
    ".    proper inclusion of the afterpulsing in the analysis of the data is very important , but it depends on the properties of the photodetector ( including the overall rate of afterpulsing and its time constant as well as the @xmath41 recharge time of the cells ) as well as on the details of the experimental analysis ( gate length ) . in the simplified model described above the afterpulsing rate",
    "is identical with the rate of thermally induced excitations . in the realistic detector",
    "the rate of afterpulses will be reduced by the combine effect of geiger probability and the recharge of the cell , therefore the relevant @xmath2 will be in general much smaller then the thermal excitation rate and the effective time constant of afterpulses will be diffrent from the actual lifetime of trapping centers .",
