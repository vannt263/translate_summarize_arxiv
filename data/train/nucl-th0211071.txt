    "the quantum mechanics of one - dimensional systems has been extensively investigated for a variety of purposes  @xcite .",
    "quantum scattering in one dimension has also been considered because of its value in pedagogical works  @xcite , since it retains sufficient complexity to embody many of the physical concepts and behaviours that occur in the more complex three - dimensional processes , but without the many technical aspects required for dealing with quantum scattering in higher dimensions . here",
    ", we are interested in the formulation of the quantum three - body theory on the full , @xmath0 line , based on a system of coupled integral equations for the three - body transition operators  @xcite ( ags equations  @xcite ) . we illustrate in this paper an approach that harmonizes the typical two - channel structure of the `` tunneling '' problems , due to the presence of the transmission and reflection processes , with the cluster structure of the three - body problem , thus leading to an overall reduced s - matrix for the two - fragment processes which is @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the formulation presented herein , with straightforward modifications , is suited also to describe the tunneling ( or potential - barrier ) effects due to the scattering of a two - body one - dimensional cluster impinging on an external barrier potential .",
    "the schrdinger equation for a one - dimensional system on the whole line , @xmath2 defines the transmission - reflection problem for positive energies and has two independent solutions with incident waves from the left and right , respectively .",
    "the asymptotic form for the wave function , with incidence from the left is @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the transmission and reflection coefficients , with a similar expression for incidence from the right .",
    "the s - matrix is given according to the definition @xmath5 which reduces to the identity matrix when the potential goes to zero .",
    "off the energy - shell the t - matrix is introduced according to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the free ( plane - wave ) solution . the s - matrix in respect to the on - shell",
    "t - matrix is @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the on - energy - shell matrix elements of the t - matrix . in the one - dimensional system , on the energy shell for a given energy @xmath10 ,",
    "there exist exactly two possible momenta @xmath11 . in the three - body system it is possible to define a s - matrix for two - fragment scattering in a similar way .",
    "generally , a system of three particles is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 and it is well established to introduce so called channel states , which are eigenstates of the channel hamiltonians @xmath13 with @xmath14 . in the one - dimensional system",
    "the channel states can be described by the following wave functions @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the properly normalized bound - state wave function of the two - particle fragment and @xmath17 denotes the relative motion of the particle @xmath18 with respect to the c.m . of the two - particle fragment @xmath19 .",
    "the asymptotic 1-d plane wave incoming from the left can have three different transmitted two - cluster waves , which leads to the asymptotic form @xmath20 and the reduced s - matrix for two - fragment scattering is @xmath21 this definition produces a @xmath1 scattering matrix connecting all six possible `` two - fragment asymptotic channels '' .",
    "we have shown  @xcite , that it is possible to define the two - fragment s - matrix in one dimension in the following way @xmath22 where @xmath23 are related to the ags channel - transition operators , @xmath24 .",
    "it easily seen that the structure of this equation is very similar to the corresponding one in the two - body system , with the difference that here the matrix space is expanded to account for the 2 + 1 partitions .",
    "as first application , we develop a one - dimensional spinless model that mimics three - nucleon dynamics in one dimension .",
    "in particular , we investigate numerically the effects of irreducible `` pionic '' corrections  @xcite in the one - dimensional three - body bound state by solving the homogeneous version of the ags equation .",
    "three two - body potentials that give the same 2n binding at @xmath25mev but with different `` stiffness '' of the repulsion terms have been considered .       in table",
    "[ tbl : econv ] we show the effect of one - pion ( ope3 ) and two - pion exchange ( tpe3 ) three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) type corrections . for the details of the explicit form of these correction terms",
    "we refer to the literature  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that unlike the tpe , the ope corrections have only a small effect on the ` triton ' binding energies . in figure",
    "[ fig : para ] we show the effect of an effective parameter required in the ope 3nf  @xcite ( set equal to one in table  [ tbl : econv ] ) .",
    "in conclusion we have developed an integral formulation of the one - dimensional scattering problem on the full line . as first application we tested the effects of different 3nf - type correction terms on the triton binding energy .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the investigations of the 2 + 1 fragment 1d - system to the scattering regimes .",
