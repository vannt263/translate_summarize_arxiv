    "the analysis of two - particle angular correlations in _ pp _ collisions at @xmath0 revealed an unexpected near side ( @xmath1 ) correlation in the azimuthal angle of produced particles ( ridge effect )  @xcite .",
    "there is no obvious reason why such a  long - range in pseudorapidity correlation should occur  @xcite .",
    "ridge effect has been previously observed in relativistic heavy - ion collisions and it was explained by a collective anisotropic flow of hot and dense medium ( hadronic gas or quark gluon plasma ) created at the collision .",
    "it is possible that the hydrodynamic explanation applies to high - multiplicity _ pp _ events which are sufficiently energetic for the collision products to thermalize  @xcite . in this paper we assume validity of such a scenario and postulate that the proton internal structure can manifest itself in the ridge effect . during the hydrodynamic expansion ,",
    "the spatial anisotropies of the collision area are transformed into anisotropic flow of produced particles .",
    "thus , the spatial anisotropies due to the proton structure should be reflected in the measurable collective flow coefficients .",
    "actually , there exist in literature estimates of the possible elliptic flow in _ pp _ collisions  @xcite .",
    "we basically follow the approach of  @xcite in order to make a link between the proton models considered by us and the experimental data . within the framework of glauber model  @xcite",
    ", we calculate for each model the initial spatial anisotropies : eccentricity , denoted by @xmath2 , and triangularity , denoted by @xmath3 , in proton - proton collision taking into account event - by - event fluctuations in the proton density profile .",
    "the considered phenomenological proton densities are inspired by the quark - diquark  @xcite and rgpep  @xcite models of proton .",
    "we find that it is possible to distinguish highly eccentric ( rod - like ) and highly triangular ( triangle - like ) fixed proton densities by looking at distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the multiplicity dependence of their rms values .",
    "we also calculate these quantities for the fluctuating anisotropic proton configurations ( gaussian - fluctuating model ) .",
    "we do not explicitly present results for the anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath4 because we limit our discussion to comparison of predictions of different models for the initial states in hydrodynamic evolution and the prediction of the exact shapes of the resulting final flow anisotropies is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our calculations concern the initial spatial anisotropies , though we emphasize that they should correspond to the flow coefficients measurable in multi - particle correlations in a fashion that is unlikely to be far from linear @xcite .",
    "the optical limit of glauber model treats the collision of two composite particles as a superposition of independent binary collisions between their constituents . in case of _ pp",
    "_ collisions , we assume the constituents are partons of one type , and their smoothed distribution is given by proton density profile .",
    "we fix the partonic cross section @xmath5 @xcite and adjust the number of partons in proton @xmath6 so that the experimental inelastic _ pp _ cross section @xmath7 @xcite is reproduced .",
    "the geometrical quantities calculated within the glauber formalism correspond to the impact plane of the collision ( @xmath8 ) such that any @xmath9-dependence is integrated out .",
    "the density of binary collisions is given by the expression : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a proton density profile , @xmath12 is an impact parameter and by @xmath13 we mean a set of fluctuating parameters describing the proton internal structure and orientation in space ( for fixed configuration models @xmath13 dependence will correspond only to possible rotations in space ) @xcite .    for each event characterized by @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "we calculate eccentricity @xmath2 and triangularity @xmath3 .",
    "we choose the following definition of spatial anisotropy @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an azimuthal angle in @xmath8 plane and @xmath18 .",
    "the curly brackets @xmath19 stand for the average taken with respect to the impact plane binary collision density @xmath20 : @xmath21    the differential cross section ( probability ) of a given event depends only on the integrated number of binary collisions @xmath22 , @xmath23^{n_g^2}. \\label{eq : cross - section}\\ ] ] the expectation value of a quantity @xmath24 is calculated in the following way @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the probability density of proton configuration @xmath13 .",
    "we calculate charged hadron multiplicity @xmath28 for each event assuming its linear scaling with @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is determined by the demand of reproducing experimental minimum bias charged hadron multiplicity @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "there is another approach to estimating the multiplicities and geometrical quantities within the glauber formalism , namely the wounded nucleon model @xcite . within this model ,",
    "all the averages denoted by @xmath19 are taken with respect to the local density of participating constituents instead of the density of binary collisions .",
    "however , in high energy hadronic collisions , multiple gluonic interactions are expected to occur , so we think it is more natural to use here the density of binary partonic collisions .",
    "the renormalization group procedure for effective particles ( rgpep )  @xcite suggests that a proton can be described in terms of three effective quarks and a gluon body interacting via harmonic potential . for every considered special case of this picture we model the proton as a sum of isotropic 3d gaussian densities @xmath33 corresponding to effective quarks and anisotropic gaussians @xmath34 representing the gluonic flux tubes connecting the quarks : @xmath35",
    "the effective quarks and the gluon body are clusters of partons , as in the two stage and cluster models @xcite used to explain the shape of deep inelastic scattering structure functions .      according to @xcite , the ridge effect could be the consequence of large eccentricities @xmath2 in high - multiplicity collisions between aligned quark - diquark states of protons which constitute around 20% of all possible states .",
    "we model this state , labelling it with the symbol i , as a superposition of two effective quark bodies , with quark and diquark parton densities generically described in terms of simple functions , and two gluonic tubes connecting the quark bodies ( fig .",
    "[ f : density - i ] ) .",
    "such greatly simplified density model is sufficient for tracing the effects of symmetric rod - like shape of proton in comparison with other conceivable shapes ( see below ) , leaving the more subtle effects of the asymmetry between quark and diquark for further analysis elsewhere .",
    "thus , we use here @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\   & + n_g \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\left [ \\rho_g\\left(x , y , z - \\frac{d}{4 } ; r_q ,   \\frac{d}{4}\\right ) + \\rho_g\\left(x , y , z + \\frac{d}{4 } ; r_q , \\frac{d}{4}\\right ) \\right ]   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the free parameters of the model are : the effective quark radius @xmath37 , the length of quark - diquark tube @xmath38 , and the percentage of gluon body content @xmath39 . assuming that only effective quark bodies carry net charge ( @xmath40 homogenously distributed in the diquark and @xmath41 in the quark ) , we choose @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which reproduce charge rms radius of proton ( @xmath44 ) . in this work , we always choose @xmath45 .    for comparison",
    ", we also consider a model that we label by the symbol y in which proton has a highly triangular shape ( fig .",
    "[ f : density - y ] ) .",
    "the parton density in this case is assumed in the form @xmath46(\\mathbf{r }   - \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k}{2 } ) ; r_q , \\frac{r_k}{2}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 $ ] is a rotation matrix in @xmath49 plane . in this model ,",
    "the effective quarks are located in the vertices of an equilateral triangle and the gluon tubes connect them with the center of mass of the system .",
    "again we choose @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the densities of types i and y are fixed proton structure models in a sense that the only parameters that fluctuate event - by - event are the angles describing proton orientation relative to the direction of its velocity ( not explicitly introduced above ) .",
    "we also consider a model with a fluctuating proton configuration , labelled g - f , in which the relative positions of effective quarks differ event - by - event . by generalizing the previous formulas for proton densities , we introduce gaussian - fluctuating proton density @xmath52(\\mathbf{r } -   \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_k}{2 } ) ; r_q , \\frac{r_k}{2}\\right ] .",

    ", we assume that the probability density of finding a proton whose quarks are in positions @xmath58 is gaussian with an additional constraint of in the center - of - mass frame ( @xmath59 , obtained by recentering of the quarks ) , @xmath60 ^ 3 }   e^{-(r_1 ^ 2 + r_2 ^ 2 + r_3 ^ 2 ) / 2 r_p^2 }   \\ .\\ ] ] the free parameters in the g - f model are @xmath39 , @xmath37 and @xmath61 .",
    "again we set @xmath50 , which implies the value @xmath62 , if one wants to obtain the experimental rms proton charge radius .",
    "we present the event distribution of eccentricities @xmath2 and triangularities @xmath3 for three classes of _ pp _ collision models : ii , yy and g - f in which colliding protons are described by i , y or g - f model , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ f : ecc ] , [ f : tri ] ) .",
    "we also present the rms values @xmath63 and @xmath64 in certain multiplicity bins ( fig .",
    "[ f : mean - ecc ] , [ f : mean - tri ] ) and the distribution of event multiplicities @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ f : multi ] ) .",
    "the reason for presenting rms and not mean values of anisotropies is because the former correspond hydrodynamically to the actual anisotropic flow coefficients extracted from two particle correlations ( we base this approach on @xcite ) . the minimum bias ( averaged over all events ) @xmath65 are 0.37 , 0.40 and 0.31 for ii , yy and g - f model , respectively , while @xmath66 = 0.14 , 0.23 , 0.15 , correspondingly ( these quantities can be calculated using probability densities from fig .",
    "[ f : ecc ] and fig .",
    "[ f : tri ] ) .",
    "all the calculations are performed by means of a monte carlo algorithm .",
    "300 000 events are generated for each class of collision .",
    "the statistical weight of an event is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - section ] ) and the mean values are calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean ] ) . in case of i and y models",
    ", we average only over the impact parameter @xmath12 and over all the possible space orientations of protons during the collision . in case of g - f model ,",
    "the additional averaging over the positions of effective quarks takes place .",
    "the event multiplicity @xmath28 is estimated by the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicity ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath6 in such a way that the experimental _ pp _ inelastic cross section of 60 mb is reproduced .",
    "this is accomplished for @xmath6 in range 7 - 10 .",
    "similarly , the parameter @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiplicity ] ) is found to vary between 5 and 11 .",
    "our calculations predict quite high values of eccentricities and triangularities in _ pp _ collisions . assuming the hydrodynamic limit in which the scaling between the initial spatial and finite momentum anisotropy is linear and taking @xmath67 @xcite , we expect minimum bias @xmath68 for quark - diquark , triangular and gaussian - fluctuating model .",
    "boek extracts from the ridge effect @xmath69 in range of 0.04 - 0.08 @xcite which can potentially be in agreement with our results if viscous effects reducing the scaling factor are taken into account .",
    "our models predict that one in principle should be able to distinguish quark - diquark ( i ) , triangular ( y ) and gaussian - fluctuating ( g - f ) proton configurations by extracting the collective flow coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath70 from multi - particle correlations .",
    "the actual shapes of the collective flow dependence on multiplicity will differ from fig .",
    "[ f : mean - ecc ] and fig .",
    "[ f : mean - tri ] , though it is reasonable to assume that to a first approximation the scaling of @xmath4 with @xmath71 is linear . in general , the anisotropies in collisions of triangular protons , denoted as yy , are much higher than in those of ii or g - fg - f .",
    "this was expected because irrespective of the orientation of y protons the collision area is always anisotropic .",
    "we find that the values of anisotropy coefficients in yy collisions increase strongly in high multiplicity bins @xmath28 .",
    "collisions of quark - diquark protons ( ii ) are characterised by relatively large eccentricities @xmath2 ( though not as large as in yy collisions ) and small triangularities @xmath3 .",
    "the distributions of anisotropies and the @xmath28 dependence of their mean values are the most smooth for the g - fg - f collisions , which results from the existence of additional degrees of freedom .",
    "we observe that the fraction of high - multiplicity events in the fixed configuration models is smaller than in the gaussian - fluctuating model .",
    "our comparison to the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ f : multi ] ) indicates that a more realistic model of @xmath72 collision should include not just one type , but all ii , yy , g - fg - f ( and iy , ig - f , yg - f ) types of collision configurations with certain probabilities .",
    "however , the g - f model alone can approximately describe the experimental results for multiplicity distributions .",
    "avsar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite using dipsy monte carlo generator predict values of eccentricity which are similar to our result for triangular proton configurations .",
    "the distributions of eccentricities within the hot spot model @xcite seem to be centered more towards higher values of @xmath2 than in our result .",
    "the probable reason is that the hot spot model lacks any constraint on the relative positions of quarks .",
    "it is hard to make any direct comparison with the other mentioned calculations , however all of them @xcite predict measurable anisotropies in _ pp _ collisions .",
    "in view of the great interest in understanding proton structure , it is pointed out that even simple model ideas concerning distribution of quarks and gluons in protons lead to non - trivial multiplicity dependence of initial anisotropies in _ pp _ collisions .",
    "we illustrate this statement with results obtained for phenomenological models intuitively inspired by rgpep in qcd and similar ideas . expecting new data on high - energy _",
    "_ collisions from the @xmath73 runs of the large hadron collider , we believe that detailed studies of the role of proton structure models in description of such collisions may shed new light on the internal structure of protons",
