    "tiles of scintillators ( see also @xcite ) , set in a circular crown array facing the horizons may be able to inspect a wide solid angle , recording the muon tracks , as well as their eventual electromagnetic companion bundles .",
    "an hybrid crown made by a circular cerenkov light telescopes and by muon - gamma - electron scintillator arrays , may be an ideal detector for horizontal cosmic rays and tau air - shower signals .",
    "a few arrays of such crown detectors located at a few kilometer one from the other may even better probe the horizontal air - shower arrival , structure and lateral distribution .",
    "the larger horizontal distances widen the shower s cone into wider areas , while the geo - magnetic field open the positive - negative charges in a very characteristic fan - like shape , polarized by , and , aligned orthogonal to , the local geo - magnetic field vector .",
    "these elongated inclined showers are thin , collimated , fork - shaped and diluted in elongated areas ; because of it they occur in proportion more frequently , up to two - three order of magnitude ( respect to near but dense vertical showers ) .",
    "the gevs @xmath6 telescopes at the top of the mountains or in space may detect at the horizons both pevs up to eev ( or more energetic ) hadronic cosmic rays secondaries . correlated details on arrival angle and crossed column depths , the shower shape ,",
    "its timing signature and photon flash intensity , may inform us on the altitude interaction , primary uhecr composition , lateral dispersion , off - axis geometry and total shower energy .",
    "additional muon - gamma crown detectors may capture various leptons , @xmath10 , and their decayed @xmath11 and @xmath6 tracks better defining the shower composition and development .",
    "horizontal muon secondaries at high energy ( hundred tev ) leading to muon catastrophic electromagnetic shower in air horizons are also leading to penetrating electromagnetic air - showers : their rate at a hundred tevs is @xmath12 is comparable to up - going atmospheric muon ( at gevs energy ) induced by atmospheric neutrino ; however they they are @xmath13 deflected and are well @xmath14 the horizons ; their consequent bright cerenkov ring can not compete with the higher energy searched up - going neutrino signals . at pevs energies",
    "even prompt muons ( by the decay of charmed hadrons ) are leading to a limited flux @xmath15 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) even smaller than expected by muon secondaries of upgoing tau air - showers .",
    "therefore we shall neglect the atmospheric up - going muon showering out of the competitive astrophysical uhe muon and tau originated by pevs - eevs neutrinos in earth .    indeed below the horizons , at zenith angle ( @xmath16 ) among quite rare `` single '' albedo muons ,",
    "more rare up - going showers traced by muon ( @xmath9,@xmath6 ) bundles would give evidence of rare horizontal tau air - showers ( hortaus or earth - skimming neutrinos ) , originated by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 hadrons and/or electromagnetic shower around eevs energies .",
    "see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; their energy losses in matter has been studied for underground detectors in first approximations @xcite,@xcite , and more in details @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ".    their rate may be comparable or competitive with @xmath21 pevs @xmath22 neutrino ( by @xmath23 resonance at glashow peak @xcite ) induced air - shower ( mostly hadronic ) originated above and also below horizons , in interposed atmosphere .",
    "finally more exotic additional and complementary uhe susy @xmath24 @xcite at tens pevs - eev energy may blaze , as @xmath0 shower,(above and also below horizons ) by their characteristic electromagnetic signature .",
    "these uhe @xmath25 are expected in topological defect scenarios for uhecrs .",
    "their secondary shower blazing cerenkov lights and distances might be disentangled from uhecr by stereoscopic telescopes such as the magic ones or hess , cangoroo array experiment . the horizontal detection sensitivity of magic in the present set up ( if totally devoted to the horizons shower search ) maybe already be comparable to amanda underground neutrino detector at pevs energies .",
    "an array of crown detectors made of tiles of scintillators facing the horizons would be also able to observe from a mountain , or a balloon or a satellite at the horizons making cerenkov - muons - gamma crown arrays the ideal telescope for uhecr and uhe neutrino astronomy @xcite .",
    "ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) showers ( pevs - eevs ) born at high altitude in the atmosphere may be detected by telescopes such as magic provided that they are pointed towards the horizon .",
    "these cerenkov telescopes , set in a crown circular array toward the horizons , may be correlated by an analogous scintillator one able to trace muons and electromagnetic shower particles .",
    "the earliest gamma and cerenkov lights produced by any down - ward horizontal , zenith angle @xmath26 ) , cosmic rays ( cr ) , observed by a high ( @xmath27 km ) mountain ( whose c.r . nature is mainly hadronic ) , while crossing the atmosphere are severely absorbed by the thick horizontal air column depth ( @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "however the most energetic c.r .",
    "blazing cerenkov shower must survive and also revive during their propagation .",
    "indeed one has to expect that these cr showers contain also a diluted but more penetrating component made of muon bundles @xcite,@xcite , which can be detected in two ways : a ) by their cerenkov lights emitted after they decay into electrons nearby the telescope ; b ) while the muons hit into the telescope , blazing ring or arc of the same muon cerenkov lights .",
    "the latter muons are less abundant compared to the early peak gamma photons produced in the shower ( roughly @xmath30 times lower ) but more penetrating .",
    "they are produced at high altitudes and at an horizontal distance of @xmath31 km from the observer ( placed at 2.2 km above the sea level , and assuming a zenith angle of @xmath32 ) .",
    "therefore these hard muon bundles ( hundred gev ) might spread in large areas of tens - hundred @xmath33 while they travel towards the observers .",
    "they are partially bent by the local geomagnetic field , ( in azimuth dependence ) and they are aligned along an axis orthogonal to the field and they decay into electrons producing optical cerenkov flashes .",
    "the geo - magnetic spread of the shower leads to a aligned cerenkov blaze whose shape ( a thin elliptic splitted twin - lightening shower ) may probe the magnetic field and the cr origination .",
    "one of the characteristic consequence of this geomagnetic splitting is the twin cerenkov lights and dots appearing in the magic telescope as a very unique signature of the bending trajectories . the estimated angle separation range in @xmath34 a value that is within angular resolution of cherenkov telescopes .",
    "this may be the imprint and the trigger signal of most horizontal air - showers .",
    "such a characteristic signature may be detected by the largest gamma telescope arrays as hess , veritas , or better by forthcoming stereoscopic version of magic .",
    "we argue that their cerenkov flashes , either single or clustered , must take place , at detection threshold , at least tens or hundreds times a night for magic - like telescope pointing toward horizons at a zenith angle between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "their easy `` guaranteed '' discover may offer , we hope , a new gauge and `` meter '' in cr and uhecr detection .",
    "their primary hadronic shower secondaries might be hidden by the distance ( but not their cherenkov flashes ) ; the late shower tail may arise in a new form by its secondary muon - electron - cerenkov chain of the electromagnetic showering .",
    "moreover a rarer but more exciting pev - eev neutrino @xmath37 astronomy ( whose flux is suppressed by three - four orders of magnitude respect cr one ) may arise _ below the horizon _ with the earth - skimming horizontal tau air - showers ( hortaus ) @xcite,@xcite ; below the horizons there are not other shower at all .",
    "these uhe taus are produced inside the earth crust by the primary uhe incoming neutrino @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and they are generated mainly by the muon - tau neutrino oscillations from galactic or cosmic sources , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "finally we expect also that just above or below the horizon edge , ( within a distance of a few hundreds of km ) , air - showers due to the fine - tuned @xmath38-@xmath39 glashow @xcite resonance at @xmath21 pev might be detectable .",
    "the w main hadronic ( @xmath40 ) or leptonic and electromagnetic ( @xmath41 ) signatures may be well observed and their rate may be used to calibrate a new horizontal neutrino multi - flavor neutrino astronomy @xcite .",
    "again we argue that such a signature of nearby nature ( respect to most far away ones at same zenith angle of hadronic nature ) would be better revealed by a stereoscopic twin telescope such as magic or a telescope array like hess , veritas .",
    "as mentioned above additional horizontal flashes might arise by cosmic uhe @xmath42 electromagnetic showers within most susy models , if uhecr are born in topological defect decay or in their annihilation , containing a relevant component of susy particles .",
    "the uhe @xmath42 behaves ( for light @xmath43 masses around z boson ones ) as the glashow @xcite resonance peak @xcite . the total amount of air inspected within the characteristic field of view of magic ( @xmath44 ) at the horizon ( @xmath45 km . )",
    "corresponds to a ( water equivalent ) volume - mass larger than @xmath46 .",
    "however their solid angle detectable beamed volume corresponds to a narrower beamed volume @xmath47 @xmath48 , yet comparable to the present amanda confident volume ( for pevs @xmath38-@xmath39 and eevs @xmath17 , @xmath49 showers ) .",
    "greater volumes and masses ( up to @xmath50 ) are estimated for upward eev tau events @xcite making magic the most sensitive uhe neutrino detector today .",
    "the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) have been studied in the past mainly through their secondary particles ( @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 ) collected vertically in large array detectors on the ground .",
    "uhecrs are rare events , however the multiple cascades occurring at high altitudes where the shower usually takes place , expand and amplify the signal detectable on the ground . on the other hand , at the horizon the uhecr are hardly observable ( but also rarely searched ) .",
    "they are diluted both by the larger distance they have to cover and by the atmosphere opacity suppressing exponentially their electromagnetic secondaries ( electron pairs and gammas ) ; also their optical cerenkov emission is partially suppressed by the horizontal air opacity .",
    "however this suppression acts also as a useful filter leading to the selection of higher cr events .",
    "their cerenkov lights will be scattered and partially transmitted ( @xmath51 at @xmath52 nm .",
    ", @xmath53 at @xmath54 nm . ) depending on the exact zenith angle and the seeing : assuming an average suppression factor - @xmath55- and the nominal magic threshold at @xmath56 gev , this corresponds to a hadronic shower coming from the horizon with an energy above @xmath57 pev .",
    "their primary flux may be estimated considering the known cosmic ray fluxes at the same energy on the top of the atmosphere ( both protons or helium ) ( see dice experiment referred in @xcite ) : @xmath58 . within a shower cerenkov angle @xmath59 at a distance @xmath60 ( zenith angle @xmath61 ) giving a shower area @xmath62 $ ] , the consequent event rate per night for a magic - like telescope with a field of view of @xmath63 $ ] is + @xmath64 thus one may foresee that nearly every two minutes a horizontal hadronic shower may be observed by magic if it were pointed towards the horizon at zenith angle @xmath65 . increasing the altitude @xmath66 of the observer , the horizon zenith angle grows : @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "in analogy at a more distant horizontal edges ( standing at height @xmath68 as for magic , while observing at zenith angle @xmath69 still above the horizons ) the observation range @xmath70 increases : @xmath71 ; the consequent shower area widen by more than an order of magnitude ( and more than three order respect to vertical showers ) and the foreseen event number , now for much harder cr at @xmath72 , becomes : @xmath73 therefore at @xmath74 , once per night , a uhecr around eev energies , may blaze the magic ( or hess , veritas , telescopes ) .",
    "a long trail of secondary muons is associated to each of these far primary cherenkov flash in a very huge area .",
    "an additional characteristic of the horizontal muon bundle are their common final separated net bundle charge ( all positive or negative ) ; also earlier electron shower pairs are separated but effectively only at highest altitudes ( few tens km . )",
    "where air density is negligible .",
    "these earlier shower rings shine at wider angles some additional cherenkov precursor lights .",
    "the muon bundle showering nearby the telescope , while they decay into electrons in flight , ( source of tens - hundred gevs mini - gamma showers ) is also detectable at a rate discussed in the following section ( see also important earlier studies @xcite,@xcite,@xcite on muon bundles at horizons ) .",
    "as already noted the photons from a horizontal uhecr may be also revived by its secondary muons produced at tens - hundred gevs muons : they can either decay in flight as a gamma flashes , or they may hit the telescope and their muon cerenkov lights `` paint '' arcs or rings within the detector .",
    "indeed these secondary very penetrating muon bundles may cover distances of hundreds km ( @xmath76 ) away from the shower origin . to be more precise",
    "a part of the muon primary energy will dissipate along a path in the air of @xmath45 km ( nearly a hundred gev energy ) , thus a primary @xmath77 gev muon will reach a final @xmath78 gev energy , the minimal magic threshold value .",
    "let us remind the characteristic multiplicity of secondary muons in a shower : @xmath79 @xcite for gev muons . for the harder component ( around 100 gev ) , the muon number is reduced almost inversely proportionally to energy @xmath80 .",
    "these values must be compared to the larger peak multiplicity ( but much lower energy ) of electro - magnetic showers : @xmath81 . as mentioned before , most of the electromagnetic tail is lost ( exponentially ) at horizons ( for a slant depth larger than a few hundreds of @xmath82 ) , excluding re - born , upgoing @xmath83 air - showers @xcite,@xcite to be discussed later .",
    "therefore gamma - electron pairs are only partially regenerated by the penetrating muon decay in flight , @xmath84 as a parasite electromagnetic showering @xcite,@xcite .",
    "indeed @xmath85 may decay in flight ( let say at @xmath86 gev energy , at @xmath87 level within a @xmath88 km distances ) and they may inject more and more lights , to their primary ( far born ) shower beam .",
    "the ratio between @xmath6 over @xmath10 offer a clear hint of the shower evolution @xcite .",
    "these tens - hundred gevs horizontal muons and their associated mini - cerenkov @xmath6 showers are generated by either a single muon mostly produced at hundreds of kilometers by a single primary hadron with an energy of hundreds gev - tev or rarer muons , part of a wider horizontal bundle of large multiplicity born at tevs - pev or higher energies , as secondary of an horizontal shower .",
    "between the two cases there is a smooth link .",
    "a whole continuous spectrum of multiplicity begins from a unique muon up to a multi muon shower production .",
    "the dominant noisy `` single '' muons at hundred - gev energies will lose memory of their primary low energy and hidden mini - shower , ( a hundreds gev or tevs hadrons ) ; a single muon will blaze just alone .",
    "the frequency of muon `` single '' rings or arcs is much larger than the muon bundles and it is based on solid observational data ( @xcite ; @xcite,@xcite,@xcite as shown in fig.2 see also the references on the mutron experiment therein ) .",
    "the event number due to these `` single noise '' is : + @xmath89 .",
    "their muon abundance ( tev primary over pev primary cr ) is nearly @xmath90 .",
    "the additional gamma mini - showers around the telescope due to a decay of those muons in flight ( with a probability @xmath91 ) , is even a more frequent source of noise ( by a factor @xmath92 ) : + @xmath93 these single background gamma - showers must take place nearly once per minute ( in a negligible hadronic background ) and they represent a useful tool to calibrate the possibility of detecting horizontal cr .",
    "on the contrary pevs ( or higher energy ) cr shower cerenkov lights maybe observed , more ( nearly twenty times ) rarely , in coincidence both by their primary and by their later secondary arc and gamma mini - shower .",
    "their @xmath94 gev energetic muons are flying nearly un - deflected @xmath95 for a characteristic horizons distances d , only partially bent by the geo - magnetic fields ( @xmath96 @xmath97 gauss ) .",
    "as mentioned , to flight through the whole horizontal air column depth ( @xmath45 km equivalent to @xmath45 water depth ) the muon lose nearly @xmath86 gev ; consequently the initial muon energy should be a little above this threshold to be observed by magic : ( at least @xmath98 gev ) .",
    "the deflection angle is small : @xmath99 ) . given the area of magic ( @xmath100 ) we expect roughly the following number of events due to direct muons hitting the telescope , flashing as rings and arcs , each night : + @xmath101 + to be correlated ( at @xmath102 probability or less ) with the above results of @xmath103 primary cerenkov flashes at the far distances .",
    "moreover , the same muons are decaying in flight at a minimal probability @xmath104 leading to mini - gamma - showers in a wider area ( @xmath105 )",
    ". the related mini - gamma shower number of events we expect is : + @xmath106 + therefore , at @xmath107 zenith angle , there is a flow of dozens event a night of primary cr ( at @xmath108 ) , whose earliest showers , consequent secondary muon - arcs as well as nearby muon - electron mini - shower take place at comparable rate ( one every @xmath109 in twin correlation or one an hour for multi - correlation ) . these @xmath110 and frequent clustered signals offer an unique tool for calibrating magic ( as well as hess , cangaroo , veritas cerenkov telescope arrays ) for horizontal high energy cosmic ray showers .",
    "rarer events ( a dozen a night ) may contain at once both rings , arcs and tail of gamma shower and twin dots at a few ( @xmath111 ) degree separation ( due to geomagnetic splitting ) by cerenkov primary forked shower .",
    "it is possible to estimate also the observable muon - electron - cerenkov photons from up - going albedo muons observed by the most recent ground experiments @xcite @xcite : their flux is already suppressed at zenith angle @xmath112 by at least two orders of magnitude and by four orders for up - going zenith angles @xmath113 .",
    "pairs or bundles are nevertheless rarer ( up to @xmath114 @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "they are never associated to up - going showers ( excluding the case of tau air - showers or the glashow @xmath115 and the comparable @xmath116 ) and not competitive to up - going tau secondaries discussed below .",
    "the appearance of horizontal uhe @xmath118 @xmath119 air - showers ( hortaus or earth - skimming neutrinos ) has been widely studied @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; see also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and more recent @xcite .",
    "their rise from the earth is source of rare clear signals for neutrino uhe astronomy ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "however also horizontal events by uhe @xmath21 pev , glashow @xmath115 and a possible comparable susy @xmath117 @xcite hitting and showering in air have a non negligible number of events ; one should remember that at peak resonance the probability conversion is @xmath120 at 150 km air distance : @xmath121 assuming the minimal gzk neutrino flux : @xmath122 ev @xmath123 . therefore in a year of observations , provided that the data are taken at night , assuming a minimal gzk flux , a crown array of a @xmath124 magic - like telescopes set on a circle ( @xmath125 ) and facing the horizon , would give a number of events comparable to a @xmath126 detector , ( nearly a dozen per year ) .",
    "indeed magic pointing at the horizon offers a detection comparable to the present amanda @xmath127 effective volume . a better efficency ( but not higher rate ) occurs at eev energies for tau ( by gzk neutrino ) induced air - showers @xcite .",
    "the same result may be improved assuming the coexistence of a scintillator crown array able to verify the electromagnetic and muon shower in coincident arrival time .",
    "the result may be greately increased by a number of multiple crown array located at different ( km ) distances and altitudes .",
    "the crown area may encompass a large area as hundreds square meters array ( see last figure ) and its structure may be added around the cerenkov crown telescope array at the same mountain top . its ability to discover muons ( sometimes in correlation with the cerenkov telescope ) as well as the electromagnetic trace @xmath128 nature , for a total area of 63 @xmath129",
    ", is superior by a factor two respect a ( single ) magic telescope , because it enjoys a larger solid angle and a longer recording time .",
    "magic - crown and muon crown array may reveal tens of thousands horizontal cr shower and a ten of up - going neutrino induced air - shower a year ( for gzk minimal fluxes ) . to conclude , while magic looks upward to investigate the low gamma gevs astronomy , the same telescope looking at the horizon may well see higher ( pevs - eevs ) cr , and rarely along the edge , gzk @xmath115 neutrinos ; finally , below the horizons @xmath130 air - showers arise and , surprisingly even susy @xmath131 lights may come in the sky ( with electronmagnetic showers ) .",
    "finally the possible detection of up - going few - tens gev muons ( induced by energetic solar flare ) at a rate @xmath132,for few minutes , during the maximal solar flare activity , might also be a target of such new muon - cerenkov astronomy @xcite .",
    "meter radius size , whose inner - outer aligned tiles are able to reveal , by time of flight , the crossing and the azimuth directions of horizontal muons ( and electron pairs and gamma ) bundles ; in the picture one an upward horizontal tau air - shower ( label by @xmath83 ) ; the @xmath133 tile disposal guarantees a wide azimuth solid angle view .",
