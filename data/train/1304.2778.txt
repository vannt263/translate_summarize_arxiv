    "in recent years , there has been a dramatic growth in interest in the physics of nonequilibrium quantum systems , driven in large part by advances in experimental atomic physics , in particular in the area of optical lattices  @xcite . the precision time - dependent control and observation of quantum effects afforded by these experiments , together with the high degree of isolation of the system from the environment ,",
    "have invigorated the theoretical study of the time evolution of isolated many - body quantum systems .",
    "the predictions of previously abstract lines of theoretical inquiry into the mechanisms by which thermal behavior emerges from purely unitary time evolution , and the role of conservation laws and integrability in such dynamics , can now be directly compared with empirical evidence acquired in experimental laboratories .",
    "several theoretical studies into the quantum origins of thermalization in isolated nonintegrable systems have found that , away from the edges of the spectrum , few - body observables relax to the predictions of conventional statistical ensembles  @xcite , a phenomenon which has been connected @xcite to the emergence of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is now well established that the highly constrained dynamics of integrable systems can in fact give rise to the relaxation of few - body observables , and that the equilibrium values of these quantities are in many cases described by the generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) @xcite .",
    "the gge is constructed by maximizing the many - body entropy @xcite while constraining the mean values of all integrals of motion to their expectation values in the initial state @xmath0 of the system .",
    "the density matrix in the gge takes a gaussian form similar to that of the grand - canonical ensemble , and can be written as  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 $ ] is the gge partition function , the @xmath3 are the conserved integrals of motion , and the @xmath4 are the corresponding lagrange multipliers , which are determined by the constraints @xmath5=\\langle\\psi_i|\\hat i_s|\\psi_i\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the significance of the fact that the gge provides an accurate description of observables following relaxation can be seen by contrasting its predictions with those of the `` diagonal ensemble '' ( de )  @xcite : for any initial state @xmath0 , the time evolution of an observable @xmath6 under a time - independent ( integrable or nonintegrable ) hamiltonian @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the infinite - time average of the observable is therefore given by @xmath14 which defines the expectation value of @xmath6 in the de  @xcite .",
    "the de involves as many constraints as the dimension of the many - body hilbert space ( the overlaps of the initial state with the eigenstates of @xmath7 ) , which grows exponentially with system size .",
    "by contrast , for models that can be mapped to noninteracting hamiltonians , the gge involves a number of constraints that is only polynomially large in the size of the system  @xcite .",
    "it may , therefore , appear surprising that the predictions of the gge for expectation values of observables can agree with those of the de .    from a many - body perspective",
    ", the success of the gge can be understood as follows  @xcite : the eigenstates of a given integrable hamiltonian with similar distributions of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few - body observables ( with the differences vanishing in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "furthermore , the majority of the states that contribute to the de have a distribution of conserved quantities similar ( in a coarse - grained sense ) to that of the initial state , and this is also the case for the states that contribute most strongly to the gge .",
    "these facts imply that differences between the weights in the de and the gge are irrelevant and both ensembles will produce the same results for few - body observables in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this scenario can be viewed as a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis @xcite , and has been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite for describing observables after relaxation by means of a single representative state .",
    "interestingly , it has been recently shown that in an integrable system , in the presence of localization , the gge can fail to describe observables after relaxation @xcite .",
    "this effect , which parallels the breakdown of eigenstate thermalization in nonintegrable disordered lattice systems in the presence of localization  @xcite , has been related to the localized behavior of the underlying system of noninteracting particles to which some integrable models can be mapped @xcite . here",
    "we gain further insights into this phenomenon by undertaking single - particle and many - body analyses of noninteracting spinless fermions and hard - core bosons .",
    "we study the dynamics of noninteracting fermions within the aubry - andr model previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for hard - core bosons , and show that although the fermion momentum distribution equilibrates in the localized regime , it fails to equilibrate in the delocalized one .",
    "this should be contrasted with the density profiles , which exhibit the opposite behavior , equilibrating in the delocalized regime , but not in the localized regime  @xcite .",
    "we find that , whenever observables do equilibrate to their gge values , they do so in a manner consistent with the gaussian equilibration scenario of ref .",
    "furthermore , we relate the failure of a given quantity to equilibrate in a certain regime to the behavior of the single - particle wave functions , as discussed in refs .  @xcite .    for hard - core bosons ,",
    "we connect the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the gge was shown to fail to describe the momentum distribution function after relaxation in the localized regime , to the single - particle results for fermions .",
    "in addition , for both hard - core bosons and spinless fermions , we study the density profiles and momentum distribution functions in the many - body eigenstates of the appropriate hamiltonians .",
    "we focus in particular on the behavior of these quantities in the many - body eigenstates that contribute to the de , to the microcanonical ensemble ( me ) , and to the microcanonical version of the gge , i.e. , the generalized microcanonical ensemble ( gme )  @xcite .",
    "we find indications that single - particle real - space localization in the localized phase and momentum - space localization in the delocalized phase lead to a distinctive behavior of the many - body eigenstate expectation values of the density and the momentum distribution of the fermions , respectively .",
    "no similar effect is detected in the many - body eigenstate expectation values of the momentum distribution of the hard - core bosons .",

    "specifically , we examine the relaxation dynamics and time fluctuations of one - body observables , as well as properties of the single - particle eigenstates that help us understand the observed out - of - equilibrium behavior .",

    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider two models on a one - dimensional lattice with open boundary conditions : noninteracting spinless fermions ( sfs ) and hard - core bosons ( hcbs ) .",
    "the hcb model can be mapped onto the model of sfs , by mapping it first onto a spin-1/2 chain via the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite and then onto sfs via the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite . in both cases , we study the effects of an additional periodic potential , with a period incommensurate with that of the underlying lattice of the tight - binding model , which results in the well known aubry - andr model  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonians for sfs and hcbs are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , where @xmath17 is the length of the lattice , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are fermionic ( bosonic ) annihilation and creation operators on site @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are sf ( hcb ) site - occupation number operators .",
    "the prohibition of multiple occupancy of a single site for hcbs is enforced by the hard - core constraint @xmath25 .",
    "we denote the hopping parameter by @xmath26 , and the strength of the incommensurate potential by @xmath27 .",
    "to ensure the incommensurability of the lattice potential , we use an irrational value for @xmath28 .",
    "we select the inverse golden mean , @xmath29 , which is considered to be the most irrational number @xcite . for each given system size",
    ", we take the total number of sfs ( hcbs ) @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) to be @xmath32 . in what follows",
    "we set @xmath26 to unity ; i.e. , we take @xmath26 as our unit of energy , and we also set @xmath33 and the boltzmann constant @xmath34 .",
    "the fermionic hamiltonian ( [ hamfermions ] ) is quadratic and therefore trivially solvable : all many - body eigenstates can be constructed as slater determinants of the single - particle energy eigenstates in the incommensurate periodic potentials .",
    "although the bosonic hamiltonian  ( [ hambosons ] ) is also superficially quadratic , the hard - core constraints on the bosonic creation and annihilation operators encode interactions between the bosons , precluding a _",
    "direct _ diagonalization in terms of single - particle states .",
    "nevertheless , it can be solved via the combined holstein - primakoff and jordan - wigner transformations , which implies that sf and hcb systems with hamiltonians eqs .   and ,",
    "respectively , share the same ( many - body ) energy spectrum and consequently have identical thermodynamic properties .",
    "moreover , the two models have identical site occupations @xmath35 .",
    "the properties of hcbs in the aubry - andr model have previously been investigated , at both zero  @xcite and finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "the single - particle aubry - andr model exhibits a localization - delocalization transition at the critical potential strength @xmath36",

    "correlations in the ground state of the bosonic system decay exponentially with spatial separation , and the system is said to form a bose glass @xcite .",
    "here we study the dynamics and behavior of observables following sudden quenches of the incommensurate lattice strength @xmath27 .",

    "we focus on one - body observables that are accessible in optical lattice experiments : the density profiles @xmath43 , and the momentum distribution functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 we note that although the site occupations are equal for sfs and hcbs , the off - diagonal spatial correlations , and therefore the momentum distributions , of the two systems are distinct . to calculate @xmath46 in a pure state",

    "@xmath47 i.e. , it is diagonal in the ( many - body ) energy representation , and the energy eigenstates are weighted according to their overlaps with the initial state .",
    "the expectation value of an observable in this ensemble is given by eq .  .",

    "we have checked that expectation values of observables within our microcanonical calculations are robust against the exact value of @xmath51 . to ensure this , we select @xmath51 to be much smaller than the full spectrum width , but sufficiently large to contain many eigenstates ( i.e. , larger than the average level spacing at the given @xmath52 ) . in general , @xmath53 for most results reported in this work .    _ generalized gibbs ensemble . _",
    "the density matrix for this ensemble , which is of a similar gaussian form to that of the grand - canonical ensemble , was already introduced in eq .  .",
    "we note that a recipe for constructing the appropriate conserved quantities , allowing for the extension of the gge description to more general systems than those considered in this article , has recently been proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , we make here the `` natural '' choice for the conserved quantities , taking them to be the occupations of the single - particle eigenstates of the noninteracting sfs @xcite",
    ".    _ generalized microcanonical ensemble . _",
    "the gme is the microcanonical version of the gge @xcite .",
    "the only energy eigenstates that contribute to this ensemble are those that have distributions of the conserved quantities that are similar ( in a coarse - grained sense ) to that of the initial state .",
    "these eigenstates are all assigned the same weight , as in the usual me .",
    "the density matrix of the gme therefore has the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 measures the distance of the eigenstate @xmath56 from the target distribution of conserved quantities determined by the initial state , and @xmath57 is the number of energy eigenstates within the gme window @xmath58 .    in order to construct the gme , one needs to compare the distribution of conserved quantities in each of the eigenstates of @xmath41 with that of the initial state .",
    "since the conserved quantities are fermion occupation numbers of single - particle energy eigenstates , their expectation values @xmath59 in the many - body eigenstates are either 0 or 1 .",
    "by contrast , the occupations of the conserved quantities in the initial state ( which are equal to those in the de ) can assume any real value between these two values ; i.e. , @xmath60 . to compare those distributions , in a coarse - grained way",
    ", we proceed as follows @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) we sort the conserved quantities so that @xmath61 decreases monotonically as @xmath62 increases . in this way we obtain a comparatively smoothly varying discrete distribution suitable for coarse graining .",
    "\\(ii ) after sorting , we generate a discrete target distribution of conserved quantities from @xmath63 .",
    "this is achieved by interpolating @xmath61 to find a continuous function @xmath64 ( where @xmath62 can now be any real number in the interval [ @xmath65 ) , and then computing all values @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the set @xmath70 , together with the set of corresponding weights @xmath71 , defines the target distribution .",
    "\\(iii ) we introduce a measure @xmath55 to quantify how close the distribution of each many - body eigenstate @xmath72 is to the target distribution .",
    "those states with @xmath73 are included in the gme .",
    "the choice of @xmath55 is not unique .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose @xmath74 where @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , enumerate the sorted single - particle states [ see ( i ) ] occupied in eigenstate @xmath72 .",
    "we choose the value of @xmath77 to be that which yields the minimum value of the normalized absolute difference @xmath78 between the expectation values of the conserved quantities in the gme and de . as in our microcanonical calculations",
    ", we have checked that our results are robust against small changes in the value of @xmath77 .",
    "in ref .  @xcite it was shown that , following a quench of hcbs to the localized regime of the aubry - andr model , one - body observables that depend on nonlocal correlations , such as @xmath79 , do relax to time - independent values ( with fluctuations vanishing in the thermodynamic limit ) , but these values are not consistent with the predictions of the gge .",
    "this should be contrasted with the on - site density , whose time average agrees with the gge results in all regimes .",
    "it was also found that the dynamics of @xmath80 and @xmath79 are qualitatively different in the delocalized and localized regimes : the momentum distribution @xmath79 approaches a time - independent value with increasing system size regardless of whether the system is in the delocalized or localized regime , while @xmath80 only exhibits such relaxation in the delocalized regime .",
    "all results for the density also apply to sfs , to which hcbs can be mapped .    here , we begin by studying the relaxation dynamics of the momentum distribution @xmath81 of sfs , which is in general completely unrelated to the momentum distribution of the corresponding system of hcbs . in fact , the gge describes , by construction , the infinite - time averages of all one - body fermionic observables regardless of whether the single - particle states are localized or delocalized and independently of the system size .",
    "this can be straightforwardly proven by projecting @xmath82 onto the single - particle sector .",
    "considering that all eigenstates of the many - body hamiltonian are ( antisymmetrized ) direct products of the single - particle states @xmath83 in which @xmath84 is diagonal ( @xmath85 ) , the time evolution of the one - particle density matrix can be cast in the form @xmath86 in the absence of degeneracies in the single - particle spectrum ( which is the case in the aubry - andr model considered here ) , the infinite - time average of @xmath87 can be written as @xmath88 which is , by construction , the single - particle density matrix predicted by the gge , as @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this does not necessarily imply that all such observables exhibit _ relaxation _ to their gge values .",
    "in particular , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the on - site densities in the localized phase exhibit finite fluctuations about their gge expectation values even in the thermodynamic limit .     in quenches @xmath90 (",
    "as indicated in the panels ) for systems with 10 , 100 , and 1000 lattice sites ( curves from top to bottom in each panel ) , and @xmath91.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    in order to quantify how closely @xmath92 approaches the corresponding gge prediction , we compute the normalized difference @xmath93 between the instantaneous momentum distribution at time @xmath94 and the gge prediction for this quantity .",
    "relaxation of @xmath81 to the gge prediction is observed if @xmath95 vanishes at long times , in the thermodynamic limit . in practical numerical calculations , however , @xmath96 will always be finite , because of finite - size effects .",
    "the signature of relaxation to the gge in our calculations is therefore that @xmath95 fluctuates about a finite average value at long times , and that this average value scales towards zero with increasing system size .    in fig .",

    "the legends for the ensembles considered are the same in all panels and are reported in ( d ) .",

    "[ fig : consquant].,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    figure  [ fig : momcri ] shows results for the momentum distribution functions of sfs ( left columns ) and hcbs ( right columns ) .",
    "they are also intermediate between those obtained in the delocalized and localized regimes . the average variance @xmath242 is larger for sfs than for hcbs , as in the delocalized phase .",
    "it can also be seen to decrease with increasing system size ( as it does in the localized phase ) , but has a tendency to saturate ( as it does in the delocalized phase ) , so results for much larger system sizes will be needed to resolve whether it vanishes or remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of the momentum distribution function of noninteracting spinless fermions following quenches to the delocalized , localized , and critical regimes of a quasiperiodic lattice system .",
    "we found that although the time - averaged value of this observable agrees exactly with the predictions of the gge in all three regimes , it does not exhibit relaxation after a quench in the delocalized phase .",
    "this is complementary to the failure of the on - site density of hard - core bosons ( and therefore the noninteracting fermion system considered here ) to equilibrate in the localized regime that was previously observed in ref .",
    "these behaviors can be understood in terms of localization of the single - particle eigenstates of the fermion model , in momentum space for the delocalized regime , and in real space for the localized regime , as discussed in refs .",
    "this analysis also helps us understand the previously observed failure of the gge to describe the momentum distribution functions of hcbs after relaxation in the localized regime @xcite as a consequence of nonvanishing time fluctuations of one - particle fermionic correlations that persist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we found that in the delocalized and localized regimes , the sf observables that do exhibit relaxation to the gge  the density in the former case , and the momentum distribution function in the latter ",
    "do so in a manner consistent with the gaussian equilibration picture of campos  venuti and zanardi  @xcite . in quenches to the critical point of the aubry - andr model , we observed that both the density and the momentum distribution function of sfs exhibit equilibration to the gge , but that the decay of the time fluctuations of these quantities with increasing system size is slower than that predicted by the conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also studied the expectation values of one - body observables in the many - body eigenstates of the sf and hcb hamiltonians , comparing results for the diagonal , microcanonical , and generalized microcanonical ensembles .",
    "we found a clear distinction between the predictions of the me for the expectation values and those of the gme .",
    "the differences between the expectation values in the former ensemble and the de were consistently larger ( and were in fact greater than 10% in all cases except for the momentum distributions in quenches to the localized phase ) and indications were found that these differences approach nonzero values as the system size is increased toward the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the predictions of the gme were found to be much closer to those of the de and , for the system sizes studied , the differences between the expectation values in these two ensembles were observed in most cases to decrease with increasing system size .",
    "our study indicates that the single - particle localization  in momentum space in the delocalized regime and in real space in the localized regime  that precludes relaxation of the corresponding observables to the gge also leads to finite thermodynamic - limit variances of momentum and site occupations , respectively , in the many - body eigenstates of the sf hamiltonian .",
    "by contrast , the failure of the gge to describe the momentum distribution of hcbs after relaxation in the localized phase was not found to be associated with any corresponding saturation of the variance of momentum occupations in eigenstates of the hcb hamiltonian with increasing system size .",
    "because of finite - size effects , we did not find clear indications of the behavior of the maximum differences between expectation values of the density and momentum distributions in distinct eigenstates contributing to the various ensembles as the system size is increased .",
    "it would be particularly important to understand whether the values of observables in the individual eigenstates constituting the gme approach their average values in this ensemble with increasing system size , in order to clarify whether generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the delocalized regime  which would explain why the gge works there for describing the momentum distribution functions of hcbs after relaxation  and whether generalized eigenstate thermalization fails ( as we expect ) in the localized regime , where the gge fails .",
    "it would also be interesting to see how the addition of nearest neighbor interactions  @xcite , which break integrability , modify our findings for both sfs and hcbs .",
