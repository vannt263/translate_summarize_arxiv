    "recent observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) have revealed that the present universe is undergoing accelerated expansion  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the energy density of the universe at present epoch is dominated by dark energy with equation of state @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the energy density of dark energy , and @xmath12 is its pressure .",
    "combining with observations of cmb anisotropy  @xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao )  @xcite , the density parameter is determined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the critical density today and @xmath15 is the present hubble parameter .    the simplest way to explain dark energy is to introduce a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "however , this model suffers from two problems  @xcite .",
    "the first one is the fine - tuning problem : the observed cosmological constant is extremely small compared to the fundamental planck scale @xmath11 @xmath16 @xmath17 , requiring an incredible fine - tuning .",
    "the second one is the cosmic coincidence problem : why the cosmological constant and matter have comparable energy density today even though their time evolution is so different .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed to solve these problems , such as quintessence  @xcite , phantom  @xcite , quintom  @xcite and holographic dark energy  @xcite .    in particular , the holographic dark energy ( hde ) models have been discussed extensively in recent years .",
    "these models are motivated by the holographic principle of quantum gravity  @xcite . from the condition that a system with size @xmath18 would not form a black hole ,",
    "it is required that the total vacuum energy should not exceed the mass of the black hole of the same size .",
    "therefore , the dark energy density @xmath11 must satisfy @xmath19  @xcite , where @xmath20 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "saturating this inequality , @xmath11 is defined by  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a dimensionless parameter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the size @xmath18 , which is regarded as an ir cut - off , was chosen to be the inverse hubble expansion rate @xmath23 to naturally explain the observed vacuum energy density @xmath24 .",
    "however , it was shown that this choice can not explain the accelerated expansion of the universe at present  @xcite .",
    "this problem was solved in ref .",
    "@xcite by choosing @xmath18 to be the future event horizon @xmath25 .",
    "extensive studies on this model have been done , and the hde model with the future event horizon as the ir cut - off is found to be consistent with current observational data  @xcite .",
    "various aspects on the hde model have been discussed in ref .",
    "there have also been further developments on the hde model by introducing an interaction between dark energy and matter  @xcite .",
    "however , it was pointed out that this model with @xmath26 has a conceptual problem that the future event horizon , which determines @xmath11 , depends on the future evolution of the universe , hence violates causality  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , inspired by the hde model , the holographic ricci dark energy ( rde ) model  @xcite was proposed in which @xmath11 is proportional to the ricci scalar curvature @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown that this model does not only avoid the causality problem and is phenomenologically viable , but also naturally solves the coincidence problem .",
    "also , it was found that the causal connection scale @xmath27 consistent with cosmological observations is given by @xmath28 which is proportional to @xmath1 in a flat universe  @xcite .",
    "this may provide us with a physical motivation for the rde model .",
    "cosmological constraints on this model were studied in ref .",
    "similar models have also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider the rde model with an interaction between dark energy and matter , and call it the interacting ricci dark energy ( irde ) model .",
    "we investigate the observational constraints on this model obtained from snia , cmb and bao data .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the irde model , and obtain analytic expressions for cosmic time evolution . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the observational constraints on this model .",
    "we summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "we consider the spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xmath29 where @xmath30 for closed , flat and open geometries .",
    "the time evolution of the scale factor @xmath31 is described by the friedmann equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent energy density of dark energy , matter , radiation and curvature , respectively , and @xmath35 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the energy density of dark energy in the irde model is defined as  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "note that @xmath11 is proportional to the ricci scalar curvature @xmath37 moreover , it is assumed that there is an interaction between dark energy and matter .",
    "the energy densities @xmath11 and @xmath38 obey the following equations  @xcite @xmath39 the interaction rate is given by  @xcite , it turns out that the matter density @xmath38 becomes negative for @xmath40 .",
    "this problem does not occur for @xmath41 . however , the case @xmath42 is disfavored by observational constraints . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath6 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the energy density of radiation is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the present value of radiation density .",
    "we adopt a convention that @xmath46 for the present age of the universe @xmath47 gyr . according to eq .",
    "( [ clm ] ) with @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ intrate ] ) , the interaction can be relevant if @xmath49 and @xmath38 are comparable , whether or not the universe is in the radiation - dominated epoch . in literatures ,",
    "various types of interactions between dark energy and matter have been considered , including @xmath48 = @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and so forth . at present , no definite mechanisms to determine the interaction are established .",

    "let us consider the case @xmath3 @xmath84 0.45 and @xmath6 @xmath84 0.15 which corresponds to @xmath85 @xmath86 0.25 and @xmath87 @xmath86 @xmath88 .",
