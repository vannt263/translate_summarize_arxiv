    "a large variety of models for surface growth is known to display universal scaling laws  @xcite . in most cases",
    "one observes simple power - law scaling , i.e. , the width  @xmath0 of an initially flat interface grows with time as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the so - called growth exponent . in a finite system",
    "the width eventually saturates at a finite value @xmath3 , which grows with the linear system size @xmath4 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the roughness exponent .",
    "both asymptotic power laws can be combined in a single scaling form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dynamic exponent and @xmath9 is a scaling function with an appropriate asymptotic behavior .",
    "this type of power - law scaling , also known as family - vicsek scaling  @xcite , is generic for a large number of self - similar growth processes . however , in some cases the interface was found to roughen _ logarithmically _ with time .",
    "this may happen , for example , when a system undergoes a roughening transition .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study a simple model with such a logarithmic scaling behavior in more detail . to this end",

    "the models exhibit a robust phase transition from a non - moving smooth phase to a moving phase , where the interface roughens continuously .",
    "remarkably , this roughening transition takes place even in one spatial dimension . at the critical point",
    "the interface width was found to increase logarithmically with time .",
    "however , so far it was impossible to unfold the complete scaling picture since previous numerical simulations were not accurate enough  @xcite . here",
    "we close this gap by performing high - precision simulations based on a parallelized code . as a main result",
    "we find that eq .",
    "( [ standardscaling ] ) has to be replaced by a logarithmic scaling law of the form @xmath10 moreover , we present a simple approximation which explains why the interface roughens logarithmically .",
    "the growth models investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite are defined as solid - on - solid deposition - evaporation processes with the special property that atoms can only evaporate at the edges of terraces .",
    "the models are defined on a @xmath11-dimensional lattice with @xmath4 sites and periodic boundary conditions , where each site @xmath12 is associated with an integer variable  @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite two variants of models have been considered . here",
    "we will focus on the physically motivated _ restricted _ model in one dimension , where the heights at neighboring sites obey the inequality latexmath:[\\[\\label{rsos }    updates , i.e. , a site @xmath12 is randomly selected and one of the following moves is carried out ( see fig .",

    "as @xmath15 is increased , more and more islands on top of the bottom layer are produced , until above @xmath21 , the critical value of @xmath15 , the islands merge and the interface starts moving .",

    "this means that the density of exposed sites at the bottom layer @xmath24 can be interpreted as the density of active sites in a dp process .",
    "therefore , at criticality this density is expected to decay as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is one of the dynamic critical exponents of dp in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "similarly the critical behavior at the first few layers above the bottom layer can be described in terms of unidirectionally coupled dp processes  @xcite . roughly speaking each layer",
    "can be associated with a dp process which is coupled to the layer below .",
    "effective couplings in opposite direction , which certainly exist in the model defined above , turn out to be irrelevant . field - theoretic renormalization group studies revealed that the scaling exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( and hence their ratio @xmath29 ) are the same at all levels , while the exponents associated with the order parameters decrease with increasing height above the bottom layer .",
