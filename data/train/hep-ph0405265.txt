    "@xmath9 decay is a nice place to look for charmonium states which are either above the @xmath10 threshold or have quantum numbers that are not accessible from @xmath11 states by cascade decays . @xmath12,@xmath13 and @xmath14 states are such examples @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the advance in nrqcd enabled us to estimate the inclusive @xmath9 decays into charmonia without infrared divergence problem @xcite .",
    "recently , belle collaboration reported a new narrow resonance @xmath2 in @xmath15 decay channel @xcite , which was subsequently confirmed by cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is important to identify the nature of this new narrow state , and there are several works on this state already @xcite . in particular , pakvasa and suzuki pinned down possible quantum numbers for @xmath16 @xcite as follows :    * if it is a charmonium , it should be either @xmath17 or @xmath18 . where @xmath19 is the principal quantum number , and the @xmath1 quantum number is shown in the parenthesis .",
    "] also @xmath20 is another possibility @xcite . *",
    "if @xmath2 is the @xmath21 molecular state , it should be either @xmath22 with @xmath23 , or @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "also they pointed out that the dipion angular spectrum could be useful to determine the @xmath1 quantum number of @xmath26 @xcite .    in this letter , we show that the dipion invariant mass spectrum in @xmath27 provides independent information on the nature of @xmath2 .",
    "our method is complementary to the angular correlations suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is already useful to eliminate a possibility that @xmath28 state .",
    "hadronic transition between heavy quarkonia can be described in terms of qcd multipole expansion or chiral perturbation theory .",
    "since the allowed dipion invariant mass in @xmath29 is @xmath30 both approaches will be suitable to our purpose . in this letter",
    ", we use chiral lagrangian approach , since we are interested only in the spectrum and not in the absolute decay rate . under global chiral @xmath31 transformation ,",
    "the pion field @xmath32 transforms as @xmath33 under parity @xmath34 and charge conjugation @xmath35 , the pion fields transform as @xmath36    in order to introduce other matters such as @xmath7 or @xmath2 etc . , it is convenient to define another field @xmath37 by @xmath38 , which transforms as @xmath39 the @xmath40 matrix field @xmath41 depends on goldstone fields @xmath42 as well as the @xmath43 transformation matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". it is convenient to define two vector fields with following properties under chiral transformations : @xmath46 note that @xmath47 transforms like a gauge field .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by non - vanishing current - quark masses and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the former can be included by regarding the quark - mass matrix @xmath48 as a spurion with transformation property @xmath49 .",
    "it is more convenient to use @xmath50 , which transforms as an @xmath43 octet : @xmath51    one can introduce light vector mesons @xmath52 , which transforms as @xmath53 under global chiral transformations @xcite .",
    "then @xmath54 transforms as a gauge field under local @xmath43 s defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , as @xmath47 does .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath55 can be defined using @xmath56 instead of @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath57 has a simple transformation property under chiral transformation : @xmath58 both @xmath56 and @xmath47 are @xmath59 and @xmath60odd .",
    "then it is straightforward to construct chiral invariant lagrangian using @xmath7 fields . in terms of a field stringth tensor @xmath61 ,",
    "@xmath62   % + ... \\ ] ] the 1st term is the kinetic term , and the second term is the @xmath7 mass term .    since the final charmonium is moving very slowly in the rest frame of the initial state @xmath2 , we can use the heavy particle effective theory approach , by introducing a velocity dependent field @xmath63 , and similarly for @xmath64 field @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath66 is an isosinglet , it is chially invariant .",
    "if @xmath66 is an isovector @xmath67 , then it transforms as @xmath68 this will be useful when we consider the case @xmath69 in sec .",
    ".    then we can construct chiral lagrangian which is invariant under parity @xmath34 and charge conjugation @xmath35 , using the pion field @xmath70 , @xmath71 , a chiral singlet @xmath65 , the metric tensor @xmath72 and the levi - civita tensor @xmath73 .",
    "transformation properties of @xmath74 , @xmath65 and @xmath75 under parity and charge conjugation are given in table  1 .",
    ".[table1 ] transformation properties of @xmath66 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 under parity and charge conjugation . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     using our chiral lagrangian , we write down the amplitude for @xmath78 and derive the dipion mass spectrum .",
    "this approach gives the same results as qcd multipole explansion for the lorentz and chiral structures of the amplitude , upto the unknown overall normalization .",
    "similar analyses for @xmath79 were presented in ref.s  @xcite .",
    "a remark is in order before we proceed . for @xmath80 or @xmath79",
    ", there are 4 independent chirally invariant operators to lowest order in pion momenta : @xmath81 with @xmath82 , but qcd multipole expansion predicts that @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 being apriori unknown , one can not make definite predictions for the @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "rather one has to fix @xmath84 from the @xmath4 spectrum as done in ref.s  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is only single chirally invaraint operator to lowest order in pion momenta in the three options for the @xmath16 we consider in this work , and we can make a definite prediction for @xmath4 sprectrum , unlike the case for @xmath80 or @xmath79 .",
    "this decay is described by the following chiral lagrangian with heavy quarkonia : @xmath86 + h.c.\\ ] ] where the coupling @xmath87 is unknown parameter , that should be determined by the data or could be calculated within qcd multipole expansion .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit form of @xmath87 . ) then the amplitude for this decay is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are space indices .",
    "note that there is only one operator that contributes to the decay @xmath92 , so that we can predict the @xmath93 spectrum without any ambiguity .",
    "the overall normalization is determined by the decay rate , but is irrelevant to our discussion for the @xmath93 spectrum .",
    "now it is straightforward to calculate the dipion invariant mass spectrum using the above amplitude . the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .  1 in the ( red ) solid curve .",
    "note that the dipion invariant mass has a peak at high @xmath4 region , which is consistent with the preliminary belle data @xcite .",
    "another possibility for @xmath2 is that it is a @xmath95 state , whose transformation properties under parity and charge conjugation is listed in table  1 . in this case",
    "again , there is a single chirally invariant operator that contributes to @xmath96 : @xmath97,\\ ] ] which leads to the following amplitude : @xmath98 then we can predict the @xmath4 spectrum without ambuguity as before .",
    "the spin averaged squared amplitude for @xmath99 is equal to that for @xmath100 , which was also discussed within qcd multipole expansion in ref .",
    "the resulting @xmath4 spectra are the same as shown in the ( red ) solid curve in fig .  1 .",
    "if @xmath102 is a charmonium @xmath3 state with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the relevant chiral lagrangian is given by @xmath103\\ ] ] where the coupling @xmath104 is an unknown parameter , and could be determined by the data or could be calculated within qcd multipole expansion @xcite .",
    "then , the amplitude for @xmath101 is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the energy and the three momentum of the pion 1 , and similarly for the pion 2 .",
    "as before , we have ignored the overall normalization , which is irrelevant to our discussion for the spectrum .    if @xmath102 is a @xmath21 molecular state with @xmath22 , we can not apply qcd multipole expansion .",
    "still the chiral lagrangian approach will be applicable , and the above amplitude is still valid .    using the above amplitude ( [ eq:1p1 ] ) , it is straightforward to calculate the @xmath93 invariant mass spectrum for @xmath108 .",
    "we show the result in fig .  1 in the ( green ) dotted curve .",
    "note that the dipion spectrum has a peak at low @xmath4 region , if @xmath102 has @xmath22 , which is disfavored by the preliminary belle data @xcite .",
    "once high statistics data is obtained , one can easily check if @xmath109 is a correct assignment or not .",
    "this case includes that the decaying state is @xmath25 @xmath21 molecular state and the final dipion is in @xmath25 , which would be dominated by @xmath7 meson . since @xmath111 is forbidden by angular momentum conservation and bose symmetry , the @xmath93 in @xmath112 should be charged pions in this case .",
    "since charge - conjugation symmetry c is conserved in strong interaction , we must have @xmath113 , if @xmath114 .",
    "now let us construct a @xmath59even chiral invariant operator .",
    "since @xmath115 in this case , the @xmath102 field transforms as @xmath116 as discussed in sec .",
    "ii . therefore",
    "the lowest order chiral lagrangian for @xmath110 is given by @xmath117~ \\psi_{v \\beta}.\\ ] ] then , the amplitude for @xmath110 is given by @xmath118,\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 as before , and @xmath121 mev is the total decay width of the @xmath7 meson .",
    "the first term is from the contact interaction [ fig .  1 ( a ) ] , whereas the second term is due to the @xmath7 exchange [ fig .  1 ( b ) ] .",
    ", width=226 ]     or @xmath122 ( red and solid ) , @xmath123 ( green and dotted ) and @xmath124 ( blue and dashed ) . the vertical scale is arbitrary for each case , and the areas under the curves is all the same .",
    ", width=453 ]    in this case , the polarization of @xmath7 and @xmath64 tends to be perpendicular with each other , which can be tested by measuring the three  momentum of a lepton in @xmath125 and the three  momentum of a pion in @xmath126 decay .",
    "in this letter , we pointed out that the dipion invariant mass spectrum in @xmath127 could be useful in determination of @xmath1 quantum number of the newly observed resonance @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , the current preliminary data seems to already exclude the possibility @xmath28 , since the dipion invariant mass spectrum has a peak at low @xmath4 region in this case .",
    "this is apparently disfavored by the preliminary belle data . on the other hand , if @xmath128 or @xmath129 , then the @xmath4 spectrum has a peak at high @xmath4 region , which is consistent with the data .",
    "also the interpretation in terms of @xmath21 molecular state predicts @xmath4 spectrum to have a sharp peak near @xmath130 .",
    "this could be easily distinguishable in the future when more data are accumulated .",
