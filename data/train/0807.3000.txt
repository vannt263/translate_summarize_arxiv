    "local helioseismology provides a tool for studying the emergence and evolution of active regions and complexes of solar activity .",
    "several theoretical scenarios for the formation of active regions on the solar surface have been suggested within the context of the dynamo theory explaining the formation of the `` sunspot belt '' at low latitudes .",
    "recently developed `` flux - transport '' dynamo models include the magnetic flux transport by meridional circulation @xcite , flux transport by an interface @xcite and overshoot dynamo with a positive radial shear beneath the surface @xcite , or by a distributed dynamo with a negative shear @xcite .",
    "all of the models agree that the most favourable and promising place for the @xmath1 dynamo is the region which includes the deepest layers of the convection zone , the convective overshoot layer and the tachocline . nevertheless , it is difficult to keep flux tubes with strong magnetic field ( b > 100 g ) in the interior for a long time against magnetic buoyancy @xcite and then deliver them to the surface within the sunspot belt .    in a flux - transport model",
    "it is possible to calculate the velocities of macroscopic diamagnetic transport as a function of depth in the convective zone by taking into account the magnetic advection processes .",
    "estimated that in the subsurface layers the transport velocity increases from @xmath2 at a depth of 30 mm to around @xmath3 at 10 mm depth .",
    "however , the way in which the flux travels to the surface is not fully understood .",
    "there are ongoing arguments in favour of each model , and they can only be tested by comparison with the observations of active regions and sunspots on the surface and their appearance in the solar interior by means of helioseismology .",
    "time  distance helioseismology @xcite is a fast - growing area of helioseismology .",
    "the data used for time - distance inversions are the estimated wave travel - times between different points on the surface of the sun .",
    "the travel - time estimates are obtained by cross - correlating and averaging the doppler - velocity signal at different locations at the sun s surface and then obtaining the cross - correlation function .",
    "the travel times are then computed from cross - correlations either via gabor wavelet fitting @xcite or by comparing with a reference cross - correlation function ( see and references therein ) .",
    "because of the stochastic nature of solar oscillations , substantial spatial and temporal averaging of the data is required to measure the frequencies and travel times accurately .",
    "the properties of the solar interior are then determined by , first , establishing the relations between travel - time variations and internal properties ( variations of the sound speed , flow velocity , magnetic field ) .",
    "this is followed by the inversion of these relations , which are typically cast as linear integral equations , to infer the internal properties .",
    "applied the method of acoustic imaging to study the emergence of noaa 7978 , and reported the detection of the signature of upward - moving magnetic flux in the solar interior .",
    "the first time - distance investigation of an emerging active region was by , wherein an active region which emerged on the solar disk in january 1998 , was studied with soho / mdi for eight days , both before and after its emergence at the surface .",
    "the results have shown a complicated structure of the emerging region in the interior , and suggest that emerging flux ropes travel very quickly through the depth range of our observations , estimating the speed of emergence at about @xmath4 .    in section [ sec : datamethod ] of this paper the method and the data used in this work are described . in section [ sec : discussion ] the results of sound - speed inversions are presented , together with the discussion .",
    "this is followed by conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the raw doppler signal at any location is composed of velocity signals occurring due to convective motions on the scales of granulation and supergranulation , as well as the signal due to the superpositions of the wavepackets set up by resonant acoustic modes .",
    "the supergranular signal can largely be removed by filtering out frequencies smaller than 1.5 mhz .",
    "however even after removing the low frequencies and frequencies above the acoustic cut - off of about 5.3 mhz , the oscillation signals due to the nature of sources and sinks of acoustic waves set up by turbulent convection remain stochastic .    due to the fact that acoustic waves with the same horizontal phase speed ( @xmath5 ) travel the same horizontal distance ( @xmath6 ) the gaussian phase - speed filter",
    "is tuned to select waves with horizontal phase speed ( @xmath7 ) near the ray theory value corresponding to distance @xmath8 .",
    "we define a number of such filters ( @xmath9 ) corresponding to different distances ( @xmath8 ) as follows : @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the frequency and @xmath12 is the horizontal wavenumber in the data powerspectrum .",
    "each filter is applied by pointwise multiplication of the fourier transform @xmath13 of the observed velocity data .    from the filtered data ,",
    "we calculate point - to - annulus cross - correlation functions , @xmath14 for each skip - distance and each position / pixel of our data , where @xmath15 is the position vector , @xmath8 is the distance between two surface bounces and @xmath16 is time .",
    "the obtained set of cross - correlation functions is then averaged spatially over the quiet sun to obtain an estimate for the reference cross - correlation function , @xmath17 .",
    "this is used to measure one - way travel - time perturbations at each location following gizon and birch ( @xcite , also ) approach : @xmath18 }      { \\sum_i f(\\pm t_i ) [ \\dot{c}^{\\rm ref}(t_i)]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a window function designed to pick out the signal from the first bounce ( _ i.e. _ , direct arrival times ) . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to wave travelling outwards and inwards from the measurement location respectively .",
    "we define the mean travel times @xmath22 as @xmath23 .    as a first approximation , perturbations @xmath24 $ ] in these mean",
    "travel times are linearly related to the sound - speed perturbations @xmath25 $ ] in the wave propagation region , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the area of the region , @xmath28 is its depth and @xmath29 is defined as the difference between the measured travel time at a given location @xmath15 on the solar surface and the average of the travel times in the quiet sun .",
    "the sensitivity kernel for the relative squared sound - speed perturbation is given by @xmath30 .",
    "for the forward problem we use wave - speed sensitivity kernels estimated using the rytov approximation by @xcite .",
    "the rytov and ray approximations give very similar results , with the former being perhaps more reliable for inferring deeper structures @xcite .",
    "the code for travel  time inversions is based on a multi - channel deconvolution algorithm ( mcd ) @xcite enhanced by the addition of horizontal regularization .",
    "following we discretized the equation ( [ eq_tt_kernel ] ) : @xmath31 then for each horizontal wavevector @xmath32 we find the vector @xmath33 that solves @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a regularisation operator . in this work we chose to apply more regularisation at larger depths , where acoustic wave travel times provide less information , by setting @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the sound speed in the @xmath38-th layer of the reference model .",
    "we heavily regularise small horizontal scales @xcite by taking @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we invert for 14 layers in depth located at ( 0.36 , 1.17 , 2.11 , 3.28 , 4.74 , 6.41 , 8.6 , 11.22 , 14.28 , 17.78 , 21.79 , 26.31 , 31.41 , 36.95 ) mm .",
    "the errors due to realisation noise are estimated by processing the 24 quiet - sun datacubes , calculating noise covariance matrix in travel - time measurements @xcite , and then evaluating noise in inversions according to @xcite .",

    "interestingly , one can also observe a well defined region of the decreased sound speed located beneath and to the west of the first flux region with a column of negative perturbation corresponding to the location of the second flux emergence .",
    "the structure is stable with respect to changes in the pre - processing ( filtering ) scheme and inversion parameters .",
    "it is also clearly present in the averages of the datacubes obtained on any of the days considered here , from 10 to 12 july 2005 presented in figure [ fig : averaged ] .",
    "however , the shape of this decreased sound speed can not be observed in individual eight - hour inversions , possibly owing to turbulent activity .",
    "we are not certain how to interpret this region of negative sound - speed perturbation but presumably it is a region of cooler plasma . under certain conditions such",
    "a signal could arise from a monolithic flux tube originating in the deeper interior , with internal density exceeding the matter density outside the tube .",
    "alternatively , such an effect can be seen in the scenario described by in which a temperature instability leads to the formation of an active region due to eddy diffusivity and magnetic tension . if the former explanation is the correct one , then it is tempting to identify such emerging cool flux tubes with the flux tubes postulated by to explain transient darkenings they observed in continuum intensity .",
    "thus , we can hypothesize that the sound - speed perturbation seen in figure [ fig : fluxemerge ] is related to the emergence of a hot packet of plasma in the cold plasma column seen in figure [ fig : averaged ] .",
    "in such circumstances , the absence of a positive perturbation column in the bottom two images of figure [ fig : fluxemerge ] may be due to the dynamic nature of the region considered , wherein the body of increased sound speed preceded and followed by regions of decreased sound speed may cancel each other in our inversion .",
    "we note that the inversions of the interior sound speed averaged over eight datacubes obtained on 13 july 2005 ( figure [ fig : averaged ] , bottom right panel ) point to the presence of a decreased sound - speed structure column at the location of the second flux emergence with a positive perturbation directly below the surface .",
    "the latter feature can be expected given that these data are for a period after the flux emergence at the surface has become well established .",
    "so , if we assume that the region of the increased sound speed corresponds to the emerging magnetic flux and compare the sound - speed perturbation detected at the depth of 21.7 mm on 13 july 2005 04:00 and appearing on the surface around 10:00ut , this can provide an estimate of the speed of emergence at about 1.0 @xmath81 .",
    "this estimate is slightly lower than the speed reported by @xcite , but definitely higher than the velocities of a diamagnetic transport in near - surface layers estimated in @xcite .",
    "this can be an indication of some additional mechanisms affecting the flux emergence .     in percent .",

    "the contours correspond to sound - speed perturbation of 0.1 percent.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   in percent .",

    "the contours correspond to sound - speed perturbation of 0.1 percent.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    in our solutions , the errors due to realisation noise are less than 100 @xmath82 : this is estimated by processing the 24 quiet - sun datacubes and applying the approach described in @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the emergence of the active region noaa 10790 .",
    "the region has a complex magnetic structure and can be viewed as an amalgamation of two magnetic region as described in section [ sec : disdata ] .",
    "we see shallow regions of increased sound speed at the location of increased magnetic activity , with regions becoming deeper at the locations of sunspot pores .",
    "it appears that a subsurface sound - speed perturbation at depth is associated with the emergence on the surface of a sunspot and sunspot pores .",
    "we observe an object with increased sound speed which may be related to the subsurface flux prior to its emergence in the photosphere at the second location .",
    "we also observe a loop - like structure of the decreased sound - speed perturbation located below the investigated region , which is present on the averages of the inversions . it would be interesting to see if similar structures characterised by a drop in sound speed can be detected in other instances of emerging active regions .    based on our results",
    ", one can speculate that magnetised regions without any sunspots or sunspot pores lead to increased subsurface sound speed at shallow depths but no perturbation detected at greater depths . on the other hand ,",
    "the areas associated with sunspot appearance have increased finger - like sound - speed perturbations which extend to depths of 1020 mm . then by tracking the times of the emergence of magnetic flux in the subsurface layers of the sun one can estimate the speed at",
    "which flux emerges to be about @xmath83 .",
    "we also note that the precise timing of the signature of emergence in the seismic imaging is very limited by the temporal resolution of the sound - speed inversions presented here , since each set is a representative of eight hours of solar oscillations .    in view of the dynamo models discussed in section [ sec : intro ] ( , )",
    ", it could be interesting to compare such results for a variety of emerging active regions at different latitudes and stages of the solar cycle .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for the valuable suggestions that have greatly improved this paper .",
