    "with the advent of high resolution spectroscopy on 8-meter class telescopes in the early 1990 s came a revelation in the study of quasar absorption line systems . previous to this time",
    ", several large surveys were conducted with a typical resolution of @xmath9@xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath11@xmath12  .",
    "these surveys tabulated the redshift path densities of , , and lines over the redshift range accessible from optical telescopes @xcite .",
    "however , most individual systems were not resolved , so that the kinematics of the different metal lines could not be compared system by system .",
    "it is not surprising that an increase of resolution to @xmath3 ( @xmath13  ) provided detailed views of the multiphase structure of gas inside and around galaxies , since parcels of gas within the different components of galaxies are often moving at several to tens of relative to one another .",
    "the increase of resolution from thousands to tens of thousands also brought a dramatic increase in the sensitivity of surveys .",
    "this allowed measurements of the metallicity in the most diffuse gas sampled by weak forest lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for deeper surveys of metal lines as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "presently , hundreds of quasar spectra have been obtained with @xmath14 using the high resolution echelle spectrograph on keck i ( hires , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the high dispersion spectrograph on subaru ( hds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph on the vlt ( uves , * ? ? ?",
    "there is undoubtedly much to be gained from detailed studies of the absorption lines detected in these databases .",
    "however , in this paper we look toward the future and ask what advances we should expect in studies of quasar absorption lines with an increase in resolution from the presently attainable value of @xmath15   to @xmath16-@xmath17  , which is within the reach of 20-meter class telescopes for hundreds of quasars .",
    "this follows a study by @xcite of the quasar pks  @xmath18 at @xmath19 with uves on the vlt ut2 telescope .",
    "that study focused on the @xmath20 strong absorber , and measured @xmath21 parameters in the range @xmath22@xmath15  , showing considerably more structure than previous spectra @xcite with @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , @xcite considered the effect of observing at @xmath23 for studies of variation in the fine - structure constant .",
    "in addition to the increased sensitivity to weak lines , gained at higher resolution , there is reason to expect we should see substructure on scales .",
    "distinct small - scale structures are seen in the interstellar medium of the milky way on these velocity scales @xcite .",
    "very narrow components , indicating cold clouds , are seen through 21-cm absorption in some damped systems @xcite .",
    "also , detailed models of transitions detected in dla systems indicate the presence of a cold phase @xcite .",
    "the large to ratios in many components of strong absorbers , most of which are produced by lines of sight through @xmath24 galaxies , could be explained by a cold phase that produces the bulk of the absorption @xcite . in the case of the @xmath4 system toward pg@xmath1 , @xcite proposed cold clouds with doppler parameters of @xmath25   to explain the strong absorption , but these could not be resolved at fwhm@xmath13  .",
    "finally , vla observations of milky way high velocity clouds indicate that they have @xmath26  k , and most milky way lines of sight show narrow lines from hvcs @xcite .",
    "however , at fwhm@xmath13   these lines were unresolved .",
    "@xcite suggested that if the milky way is typical of spiral galaxy halos these narrow absorption features should be commonly seen in the profiles of strong absorbers and lyman limit systems .",
    "for the brightest quasars it is already feasible to use the highest resolution settings on 8-meter class telescopes ( @xmath27  40 with @xmath28 for non - exorbitant exposure times ) to study quasar absorption line systems . in this paper , we present an exploration of the power of @xmath0 in studying four absorbers along the line of sight toward the magnitude @xmath29 quasar pg@xmath1 .",
    "our observations were carried out in the service mode with the hds on the subaru telescope .",
    "the paper begins , in ",
    "[ sec:2 ] , with a general consideration of how accurately line parameters can be determined at super - high resolution . in   [ sec:3 ] , we present our subaru / hds observations of several absorption line systems in the spectrum of one of the brightest quasars , pg  @xmath1 , and discuss the implications of our @xmath0 observations of these systems . we also show the milky way absorption along this line of sight . in   [ sec:4 ] , we speculate about the progress that will be made in the study of quasar absorption lines when many quasars are observed at @xmath23 .",
    "in gas with temperatures t @xmath30 k , most metals would produce absorption features that are narrower than @xmath31 = 2  .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] illustrates progressively narrow absorption profiles of @xmath32 2796 line with column density @xmath33 @xmath34 and with doppler parameters @xmath35 from @xmath36   to @xmath37   at high ( @xmath3 ) and super - high spectral resolutions ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the various profiles were produced by convolving a model absorption feature with gaussian kernels of fwhm = @xmath38 and fwhm = @xmath39 , to simulate the resolving powers corresponding to the two spectral resolutions . comparing the profile shapes",
    ", it is apparent that , even at high resolution , the width of intrinsically very narrow lines is often misrepresented .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath21 would result in a value significantly higher than the true value , which further affects the estimation of the upper limit for the gas temperature . to explore the effect of resolution further",
    ", we evaluate the consistency with which voigt profile parameters ( i.e. , column density and doppler parameter ) can be recovered from very narrow absorption profiles at two resolutions ; @xmath0 and @xmath3 in synthetically simulated spectra .",
    "both these parameters are important for deriving ionization structure , gas phase metallicities , and other physical conditions for the absorber .",
    "in addition , using this approach , we also consider two other effects : ( 1 ) blending of lines , and ( 2 ) isotope shifts and hyperfine splitting in absorption lines .",
    "we evaluate the advantage of increased resolution in recognizing these effects and also in determining how they influence doppler parameter measurements of absorption profiles .      for our simulations we synthesized @xmath32  2796 lines with two sets of values : ( 1 ) column density of @xmath40 = @xmath41 @xmath34 and @xmath35 = @xmath42  , corresponding to a rest - frame equivalent width limit of @xmath43   , and ( 2 ) @xmath40 = @xmath41 @xmath34 and @xmath35 = @xmath44  , corresponding to @xmath45   .",
    "the former characterizes the typically measured profile parameter for the unique class of weak metal line absorbers known as `` single - cloud weak '' systems @xcite .",
    "the latter would be representative of even colder phases of gas ( @xmath46  k ) at low ionization .",
    "our choice of these values for @xmath35 for the simulations was also motivated by a desire to find the minimum doppler width at which we expected to resolve lines at @xmath3 , and to show the improvement with @xmath0 .",
    "thus the simulations are driven by the characteristics of the particular instruments that we compare .    in generating a synthetic spectrum , an ideal absorption line for the chosen parameters",
    "was first simulated using a voigt function to represent the dependence of absorption on wavelength .",
    "the synthetic profile was initially oversampled to assure accurate representation of narrow lines .",
    "it was then convolved with a gaussian instrument kernel , as described above .",
    "the convolved profile was then resampled at a rate of three pixels per resolution element to enable comparison with observed spectra for a particular @xmath47 .",
    "finally , poisson noise was added to the spectra , corresponding to a specified @xmath48 per pixel . to determine the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath21 we performed voigt profile fits on the absorption lines in @xmath50 simulated spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows a sample from those simulated lines .",
    "the fit parameters were derived by first generating an initial model profile using an automated fitting routine ( _ autovp _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and then adjusting parameters to minimize the chi - square of that initial model ( _ minfit _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , after convolving with the instrumental spread function .",
    "since we want to evaluate the balance between @xmath48 and resolution , we consider pairs of equal length exposures with @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath48 ratios were calculated using the relation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the expected number of photons incident on the spectrograph slit , @xmath53 is the grating dispersion (  / pixel ) , and @xmath54  is the slit throughput for the assumed seeing ( @xmath55 ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the incident numbers of photons are the same ( i.e , @xmath56 ) , though for real systems this is a function of the telescope throughput and collecting area .",
    "( we note also that this scaling assumes object - limited observations with negligible contributions from the background and detector read - noise . )",
    "we assume that the grating dispersions are 0.04  and 0.016  for the r=45,000 , and 120,000 spectra , respectively . to calculate the slit throughput",
    ", we consider a seeing of 0.6   ( fwhm , with a gaussian psf ) with slit widths of 0.861   and 0.3   for the r=45,000 , and 120,000 cases .",
    "these slit widths were chosen because they represent the two instrumental set - ups used in our observations of pg  @xmath1 with keck i / hires and subaru / hds . in our @xmath0 observation of pg  @xmath1 using",
    "subaru / hds we were able to obtain a @xmath57 pixel@xmath58 for a 1 hour exposure under 0.6   seeing condition .",
    "using the relation described above , this scales to a @xmath48 of 128 pixel@xmath58 for a spectral resolution of @xmath3 for identical exposure time and seeing condition .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] presents the distributions of the measured values of @xmath21 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 realizations of simulated spectra with @xmath59 @xmath34 and @xmath60   lines for various combinations of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "doppler parameter characterizes the width of the voigt profile which in turn influences the gas temperature estimation .",
    "therefore we compare the consistency in the measured @xmath21-values for each of the @xmath50 simulated spectra . for the @xmath3  simulations , we find the measured @xmath21-values are distributed with a large tail to higher values .",
    "the mode of this distribution also falls at a value that is higher than the true @xmath21-parameter and it shifts to even higher values as the @xmath48  ratio is decreased . in a small subset of cases",
    "the voigt profile models from our fitting procedure yielded results that have large formal uncertainties , @xmath61  @xmath62 , in the measurement of @xmath21 .",
    "we find that measurements with @xmath63 are poorly constrained , often with the data in one or more pixels deviating by more than 3  @xmath61 from the model fit .",
    "these models are shown in the distribution plots of figure  [ fig:3 ] as a separate category . for the @xmath64 case , the small peak at @xmath65   results from a pixelization effect .",
    "typical line profiles with the appropriate sampling are detected in a small discrete number of pixels ( @xmath66-@xmath17 ) , which can lead to bias toward particular values of @xmath21 .",
    "for these profiles the noise also sometimes conspires to produce a @xmath21 value even narrower than the instrumental spread function .",
    "in such a case , the true @xmath21 value is likely to be small , but the measurement can not be claimed as accurate .",
    "these simulations therefore reveal the inadequacy of @xmath3 data in allowing the recovery of a narrow @xmath21-value .    in comparision , for the super - high resolution synthetic spectra ,",
    "the distribution of the measured @xmath21 is significantly narrower and the mode is very close to the true value .",
    "additionally , the intrinsic value remains the most frequently recovered @xmath21-parameter even as the s / n ratio is reduced . for the @xmath48 that are compared , in almost all @xmath50 cases our fitting procedure gave a well constrained measurement of the @xmath21-value .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] lists , for the various simulations with the two resolutions , the median value of @xmath21 , with asymmetric @xmath22-@xmath61 error bars , and the fraction of voigt profile fit models with accurate fits [ @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude that at @xmath0 , a line profile with a true @xmath21-value of @xmath17   is very accurately recovered . at @xmath3",
    ", there is a significantly wider distribution of measurements , with a non - negligible chance of obtaining @xmath21 significantly greater than @xmath17  , and even occasional measurement of @xmath68   due to pixelization effects .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the distribution of the column density measurements for the same set of simulations .",
    "the distributions are broader for the @xmath3  case , with mode values smaller than the true value .",
    "measurements thus preserve equivalent width in the sense that a line with an @xmath49 measurement smaller than the true value will have a measured @xmath21 larger than the true value .",
    "the voigt profile models that gave large @xmath69 also yield large uncertainties in column density @xmath61  @xmath70 .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] also summarizes our measurements of @xmath49-values for the various simulations .",
    "comparing values in table  [ tab : tab1 ] , it is evident that the constraints from these model fits are poor .",
    "we conclude that there is a benefit of observing at @xmath0 for lines with @xmath6  , however it is likely that even at @xmath3 , the derived value will be roughly correct .",
    "the real advantage of higher resolution is for even narrower lines .",
    "we performed a similar series of simulations for  @xmath322796 lines with @xmath71 @xmath34 and @xmath72  .",
    "the results for the distributions of @xmath21 parameters for various @xmath48 values at @xmath0 and @xmath3 are presented in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the large spread in the measured value of @xmath21 for @xmath3 is indicative that this spectral resolution is inadequate to faithfully recover line widths of narrow line profiles .",
    "we again , for @xmath3 find a large number of measurements with large @xmath73 values , for measured @xmath21 of @xmath65  .",
    "this is again explained by a pixelization effect , but in this case the measurement happens to be very close to the true value .",
    "even if we had chosen a true value of @xmath21 between @xmath22 and @xmath17  , this peak would still be at @xmath74  .",
    "nonetheless , a measurement of a small @xmath21 value does imply a true narrow line  width , even if the measured value is biased by the pixelization .",
    "even for the @xmath75 spectra , the mode of the distribution for measured-@xmath21 is at a value slightly larger than the true @xmath21 although in general the measurements are well constrained .",
    "table  [ tab : tab1 ] lists the median values of doppler parameters and column densities , and their @xmath22-@xmath61 errors , for various @xmath48 values at the two resolutions .",
    "the distributions of @xmath49-values are compared in figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "the significance of increased resolution is clearly seen from figures  [ fig:3 ] through [ fig:6 ] .",
    "the determination of @xmath21 is also sensitive to the sampling , where @xmath21 greater than roughly a pixel is required . in comparison",
    ", the precision in measurements from lower resolutions can be improved only by using substantially higher @xmath48 spectra thus requiring very long exposure time .",
    "furthermore , we find that similar equivalent width limits are attained in the @xmath0 and @xmath3 spectrum for equal exposure lengths though the @xmath48 ratio of the former is substantially lower .",
    "for example , the @xmath76 equivalent width limit for @xmath3 , @xmath64 and @xmath0 , @xmath77 is @xmath78  m / pixel .",
    "also , as we discuss in the following sub - section and in   [ sec:3 ] , observations with @xmath0 , corresponding to a resolution of @xmath39  , are very important for resolving lines and separating velocity sub - structures .",
    "to probe the nature of small scale structure in absorbers it is essential to resolve closely separated velocity components .",
    "here we focus on making estimates of the scale at which superhigh resolution offers a real improvement over intermediate resolution spectra .",
    "we chose a simple scenario of two absorbing clouds , with different physical properties , marginally separated in velocity . the column densities and doppler parameters of the simulated lines",
    "were selected to match closely with those of the weak multiple cloud system at @xmath5 in the spectrum of pg  @xmath1 , so that our choice is not completely arbitrary .",
    "this multiple cloud system is discussed in   [ sec:3.3 ] .",
    "the two components have column densities @xmath40 of @xmath41 and @xmath79  @xmath34 and doppler parameters @xmath35 of 4.0 and 3.0  , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to an equivalent width ratio of approximately @xmath80 between the two components . in a set of @xmath81 simulations with a @xmath48 of @xmath82",
    "pixel@xmath58 at @xmath3 , and with the two clouds separated in velocity by @xmath83v=10  , we found that in @xmath84 of the cases voigt profile fitting was able to distinguish the two components in the absorption profile .",
    "for the same @xmath48 ratio , with the velocity separation reduced to @xmath83v=7 , in @xmath85 of the cases the simulated line was fit with just a single broad voigt profile with a mean value of @xmath86(mg@xmath87)@xmath88  .",
    "this translates to a larger upper limit for the estimated temperature of the gas ( t @xmath89  k ) compared to the true value of t @xmath90  k. for lines with the same intrinsic properties , but simulated at @xmath0 and @xmath77 pixel@xmath58 ( corresponding to an identical exposure time ) , we found that voigt profile fits recovered both kinematic components in @xmath91 of the cases with a velocity separation of @xmath83v=7  , and in @xmath92 of the cases with the velocity separation increased to @xmath83v=10  . furthermore , increasing the @xmath48 ratio of the intermediate resolution spectra did not compensate for the lower resolution . for example , when the two components were separated in velocity by @xmath15  , even with @xmath93 pixel@xmath58 at @xmath3 , the kinematically separate components were resolved only in @xmath94 of the cases . figure  [ fig:7 ] shows a sample of the simulated lines at the two resolutions . from these results",
    "we infer that even at fairly high @xmath48 ratios , intermediate resolutions can be completely inadequate in revealing closely blended velocity structures on scales smaller than @xmath95  .",
    "further , such unresolved lines can lead to overestimation of the temperature of the absorbing gas .",
    "more generally , we conclude that , if two lines are narrower than their velocity separation , they can be resolved by a voigt profile fit if the resolution is less than @xmath96% of the velocity separation .",
    "the exact criterion for separating blends is dependant on the quality of the spectra and the doppler parameters of the two lines .",
    "magnesium has three isotopes with mass numbers 24 , 25 and 26 a.m.u , with relative abundances of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the wavelengths of the resonance lines for these isotopes differ from one another . furthermore",
    ", @xmath100 mg shows hyperfine splitting .",
    "the relative shifts in rest frame wavelength for each line of the resonance doublet are measured to be @xmath101   , @xmath102   , and @xmath103   @xcite . in velocity space",
    "this corresponds to @xmath104  , @xmath105   and @xmath106  , respectively . for such narrow velocity separations , the effect of isotope shifts and hyperfine",
    "splitting becomes distinguishable only at extremely high spectral resolutions ( @xmath107 ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:8 ] . to estimate the scale at which this effect is likely to influence our @xmath21-value measurements , we simulated very narrow synthetic lines with true @xmath108 of 0.3 , 0.7 , and 1.5  .",
    "the @xmath21-values of the other isotope lines were thermally scaled .",
    "the simulated lines had @xmath77 pixel@xmath58 at @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] shows the dispersion in the incidence of measured @xmath21 for the various cases . of the @xmath50 simulated lines with @xmath109",
    ", only @xmath110 of the measurements yielded a @xmath21-value less than @xmath16  , with the recovered @xmath21-value almost always larger than the true value . for a higher true @xmath21-value of @xmath111  ,",
    "the measurements were still distributed across a range from @xmath111 to @xmath112  .",
    "the peak of this distribution , however , was closer to the true - value as compared to the previous case . for the final case , with @xmath113  ,",
    "the spectral resolution became adequate to repeatedly measure values close to the true @xmath21 value along with consistently yielding measurements that are reliable ( @xmath114 ) . in this case , although the isotope and hyperfine lines were still contributing to the final absorption profile , their contribution did not induce a significant change in the line width as the individual line widths were now larger than the largest separation between the isotope lines .    with these results",
    "we infer that isotopic line shifts and hyperfine splitting are to be considered as influencing our measurements only when the true line width is really narrow ( t  @xmath115  k , @xmath116  ) .",

    "we also consider the milky way absorption along this line of sight .",
    "we discuss the particular case of these systems , but also generalize to discuss how studies of the same type of system would be affected by higher resolution observations .",
    "since the scope of this paper is to compare observations taken at different spectral resolutions , we defer detailed analyses of the absorption - line systems presented herein to future work .",
    "the @xmath4 system along the line of sight to the quasar pg  @xmath1 has previously been studied using a combination of the @xmath3 keck / hires spectrum , data from hst / fos @xcite and from hst / stis @xcite .",

    "the asymmetrical shapes for the @xmath322796 line at @xmath122   and @xmath123   from the flux  weighted system center in hires spectrum were indicative of narrowly blended features which are clearly distinguished in the profiles in the hds spectrum .",

    "this ability of superhigh resolution to resolve additional components in strong metal line absorbers was also noted by @xcite .",
    "strong absorption systems usually have absorption from gas in different phases ( different densities and temperatures ) residing within an impact parameter of 35h@xmath58 kpc of a luminous galaxy with @xmath124  l@xmath125 @xcite . dissecting the absorption profile to reveal kinematic structures at small velocity separations of @xmath126",
    "is therefore useful in developing a physical understanding of the spatial distribution of gas in galaxies along the line of sight .",
    "if the observed absorption signatures are characteristic of disk ism @xcite , then measuring structure on the smallest scales is important to determine if the interstellar medium of high redshift galaxies follows a complex fractal structure similar to milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "resolving closely blended components , as in the @xmath127 system is also essential in developing ionization models that provide strong constraints on physical parameters .",
    "this is especially relevant when there is a difference or gradient in metallicity , abundance pattern or ionization from cloud to cloud .",

    "this value is the maximum expected if the absorption is taking place in gas at a single phase under photoionization equilibrium . in developing a model for this @xmath131 absorption system based on the @xmath3 keck / hires observations",
    ", @xcite found that the absorption line in this system is too strong to arise in the same phase as for all possible ionization parameters . to reconcile this discrepancy",
    ", @xcite invoked an additional lower ionization phase that gave rise to the majority of absorption , but which produced small amounts of .",

    "the spectral resolution of hires was inadequate to show the narrow line widths that we might expect from such cold , small - scale clumps of gas .",
    "however , the present subaru / hds spectrum provides a direct test of the @xcite prediction for this @xmath4 absorber .",

    "@xcite suggested that a uv flux contribution from the absorbing galaxy and/or mg @xmath148 h@xmath87 charge transfer could significantly influence the to ratio .",
    "their @xmath149 vlt / uves observation of a different system , at @xmath20 toward pks  @xmath18 , yield @xmath150   for the one component detected in in a spectral region with @xmath151 .",
    "the error is too large to draw a conclusion in that case .",
    "another possibility for the @xmath4 system is that there are more components in the than we are able to resolve .",
    "we conclude that our @xmath0 spectrum does not provide support for a cold phase model for the @xmath4 system , though some modified version could apply .",
    "direct tests with super high resolution for other similar systems are needed .",
    "one excellent candidate is the @xmath152 multiple - cloud , weak system toward the quasar he  @xmath153  ( @xmath154 ) , which has detected , and as well as @xcite .",
    "cold phase models may also have significant consequences for the study of damped lya absorbers ( dlas ) and sub - dlas . @xcite",
    "have resolved narrow components ( @xmath155  ) in an @xmath156 cm study of the dla system at @xmath157 toward b  @xmath158 .",
    "lines in these systems are expected , from thermal scaling , to be significantly narrower .",
    "also , more recently , @xcite report measuring kinetic temperature of @xmath159  k from h@xmath160 lines in three dlas .",
    "such a low gas phase temperature can produce narrow metal lines , with doppler width of @xmath161  , that can be accurately recovered with superhigh resolution spectra .",
    "a fair fraction of dlas have detected molecules ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating directly that they have a cold phase . other dlas and lyman limit systems may also be produced by lines of sight through cold regions surrounding molecular clouds , or regions that did not quite reach the threshold for star formation .",
    "most single - cloud , weak absorbers ( rest  frame equivalent width @xmath162   ) are not associated with luminous galaxies , although models designed to fit the lyman series line and the observed lack of lyman break constrain the metallicity of the absorbing gas to be at least 10@xmath163 solar .",
    "photoionization models suggest that the structures responsible for weak absorption might be unstable over astronomical timescales , because of pressure imbalance between a high density , low ionization ( @xmath164  @xmath136  k@xmath58 ) and a low density high ionization ( @xmath165  @xmath136  k@xmath58 ) phase @xcite .",
    "the conclusions from photoionization models are based on the observed values of column density and doppler parameter for the low and high ionization transitions .",
    "the best constraints on these parameters were mostly from high resolution data at @xmath14 or lower .",
    "the @xmath21 parameters measured at @xmath14 ( @xmath166 or @xmath119  ) allowed for temperatures of thousands of kelvin , similar to the temperatures inferred for the high ionization phases . if the true doppler parameter is smaller than that derived from the hires measurements , then it would imply that the low ionization phase has a much lower temperature than the high ionization phase .",
    "this influences the inference about their stability .",
    "line widths narrower than @xmath167   ( @xmath168  k ) can not be accurately measured at @xmath3 . therefore the temperature estimations for the low ionization phase in these absorbers may not be accurate .",
    "our @xmath0 subaru / hds spectrum allows us to test the assumption that these single - cloud weak lines are resolved .",
    "for the two single cloud weak absorbers at @xmath169 and @xmath170 found in the pg  @xmath1 spectrum , we find from the hds spectrum that the weak lines are not any narrower than values measured at r  @xmath171 ( figures  [ fig:13 ] ) .",
    "the column densities and doppler parameters from simultaneous voigt profile fits to are listed in table  [ tab : tab4 ] .",
    "thus at least for these cases , the lines were already sufficiently resolved at @xmath3 to allow measurements of the @xmath21-values that were accurate within the errors .",
    "these measurements are in concordance with the instability inference based on photoionization model .",
    "analogs of weak absorbers are known to exist in the present day universe @xcite as well as at intermediate ( @xmath129 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and higher redshifts ( @xmath172 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore confirming the transient nature of these systems is significant in addressing the question of the evolution of the processes that created these absorbing structures",
    ". a larger sample of weak absorbers should be measured with super high resolution in order to verify that we can generalize this conclusion",
    ". however , the real value in @xmath23 observations in the study of weak absorbers will be the enhanced sensitivity which will allow us to establish the shape of the distribution function for the weakest absorbers , and to infer their physical properties .",
    "approximately 35@xmath163 of weak absorbers have multiple clouds @xcite . based on their kinematics , these multiple - cloud",
    ", weak absorbers can be described as `` kinematically compact '' or `` kinematically spread '' .",
    "the kinematically compact systems have been hypothesized to arise in dwarf galaxies , and the kinematically spread systems in the outskirts of spiral galaxies @xcite , but it is likely that the situation is more complicated .",
    "varying degrees of line blending in the absorption features implies that the voigt profile fit results are sometimes going to be sensitive to resolution .",
    "this is illustrated by the @xmath173 multiple - cloud , weak system in the spectrum of pg  @xmath1 .",
    "based on hires data , this weak absorber was classified as a multiple cloud weak system with @xmath7 discrete clouds @xcite .",
    "two additional weak components were resolved in voigt profile fits to the higher resolution data in the same region , as shown in figure  [ fig:14 ] .",
    "@xcite produced models for the system based on the hires data along with @xmath174 ultraviolet spectra obtained with hst / stis .",
    "it is apparent from our hds spectrum , in figure  [ fig:15 ] , that there are two subsystems in , separated by @xmath175  . for the blueward subsystem",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,  @xmath322796 was not covered in the hires spectrum , and  @xmath322803 was not detected , but several other metal - line transitions ( e.g.  @xmath176 , etc ) were detected in the hst / stis spectrum .",
    "the greater sensitivity of the @xmath0 hds spectrum led to detection of  @xmath322803 in the blueward subsystem , which was a prediction of the models of @xcite    enhanced resolution allows the detailed shapes of absorption profiles to be surveyed , and blends to be separated .",
    "some single - cloud weak absorbers appear asymmetric when observed at @xmath3 @xcite , suggesting they may have more than one voigt profile component . more generally , it is of interest what fraction of the single - cloud weak absorbers are truly fit by single voigt profile components when viewed at higher resolution .",
    "the profiles of the @xmath169 and @xmath170 systems observed at @xmath0 here , still are fit adequately by a single component , suggesting a very simple structure .",
    "observing some asymmetric single - cloud weak may reveal some to be more similar to kinematically compact multiple cloud weak absorbers , or they could just be variations of ordinary single - cloud weak absorbers .",
    "determinations of their metallicities and comparisons of kinematics of other transitions should allow a separation of these classes .      in the hds spectrum , galactic",
    "is detected , as shown in figure  [ fig:16 ] .",
    "voigt profile fitting parameters are listed in table  [ tab : tab5 ] . for the narrowest component , at @xmath177   , @xmath178 ( epoch @xmath179 ) at @xmath180  . with this convention ,",
    "the conversion to heliocentric velocity is : @xmath181  . ]",
    "we measure @xmath182  .",
    "this shows that such narrow lines as @xmath68   can be measured at @xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", we also note that the hyperfine splitting in lines are likely to affect our measurement of such a narrow line width . the difference in rest - frame wavelength from the basic hyperfine splitting of the d1 and",
    "d2 lines has been measured to be @xmath183   and @xmath184   , respectively @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to shifts in velocity of @xmath185   and @xmath186  , respectively .",
    "as these values are very close to our measurement of @xmath187  , we expect the true-@xmath21 to be lower than this measured value .",
    "however , observing this effect by resolving the line would require spectral resolutions that are significantly larger than our hds measurement at @xmath0 ( as discussed in   [ sec:2.2 ] . )",
    "the pg  @xmath1 line of sight passes through the well - studied high velocity cloud complex c. upon inspection of a _",
    "e230 m spectrum , we find absorption detected in , , and at @xmath188 and @xmath189",
    ". we do not detect @xmath1905892,5898 at these velocities in our @xmath0 spectrum to a @xmath191 limit of @xmath192   pixel@xmath58 .",
    "recently , @xmath156 cm observations have found that high velocity , low column density hydrogen clumps have t  @xmath193  k @xcite and that narrow lines are detected in most sightlines @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath1903935,3970 is not covered in either our @xmath3 or @xmath0 spectrum of pg  @xmath1 . however , at @xmath3 , it would not be possible to test if the lines are as narrow as would be suggested by the low temperatures from .",
    "thus the study of hvcs is an application for which super - high resolution will be particularly valuable .",
    "this applies to hvcs around galaxies at high redshift as well as to milky way hvcs .",
    "the ability to routinely obtain quasar spectra with resolutions of @xmath23 is not likely to provide as large a change in the field of quasar absorption lines as the previous advance to @xmath3 , made possible with @xmath95meter class telescopes .",
    "however , the ability to probe structure on scales of @xmath194   will certainly be valuable in select applications and in detailed studies of particular absorbers .",
    "examples of such applications include probing the physical conditions of cold regions in the ism of galaxies , particularly in dlas and other strong absorbers .",
    "also , it appears that high velocity clouds , both around the milky way and at high redshift , may have a cold phase .",
    "finally , surveys extending to small equivalent widths will be aided by the enhanced sensitivity of higher resolution observations .",
    "our comparison of @xmath0 subaru / hds observations to @xmath3 keck / hires observations of various systems toward pg  @xmath1 show that at the higher resolution , more accurate doppler parameter measurements can be made , and that additional voigt profile components are resolved .",
    "however , for the particular absorbers along the pg  @xmath1 sightline no extremely narrow individual components were measured .",
    "it was only for the galactic line in this line of sight that @xmath195   was measured .",
    "because such narrow components are expected in a variety of environments , it would be valuable to push the limits of 8-meter class telescopes in order to detect them in a variety of types of systems toward the brightest quasars .",
    "we are grateful to chris churchill for giving us permission to use the keck / hires spectrum for this work .",
    "we also wish to thank the referee , john black , for several insightful comments that have increased the scope of this paper .",
