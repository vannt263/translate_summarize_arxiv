    "according to the internal - external shocks model the prompt gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is produced by internal shocks within a relativistic flow while the afterglow is produced by external shocks between this flow and the surrounding matter .",
    "the early afterglow appears during the transition from the prompt @xmath0-ray emission to the afterglow . during this transition",
    "the relativistic flow , ejected by the source , interacts directly with the circum burst medium .",
    "this interaction can be used to pin down the nature of the relativistic flow ( baryonic or poynting flux ) . in a baryonic",
    "flow the reverse shock ( rs ) that propagates into the ejecta produces both optical and radio emission .",
    "a poynting flux flow is expected to produce only the higher energy forward shock emission . while other sources of early optical and radio emission may exist also in poynting flux",
    ", the rs emission has a very robust optical and radio observable signatures that are very unlikely to be imitated by other phenomena ( @xcite ) .",
    "-ray emission ( the flux is in arbitrary units ) resulting from the collisions of four shells . the initial lorentz factor and width of these four shells",
    "is depicted in the inset . *",
    "bottom * : the optical light curve of the reverse shock as simulated numerically .",
    "the initial hydrodynamic profile of the simulation appears in the top panel inset . the total energy ( isotropic equivalent ) of the ejecta is @xmath1 erg and the external density is a constant @xmath2",
    ". the energy equipartition parameters of the electrons and the magnetic field @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the electrons spectral index is @xmath5 and the burst is at a redshift @xmath6 .",
    "note that the time axis is logarithmic . ]    in grbs the reverse shock is mildly relativistic ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that during one crossing the shock dissipates almost all the bulk motion energy of the outflow to internal energy . after a single crossing of the outflow a rarefaction wave",
    "is reflected and only the forward shock remains , forming the shocked external medium into a blandford - mckee self - similar solution . the original ejecta expands and cools at the tail of the shocked external medium .",
    "the reverse shock emission can be divided to two distinctive phases , the rs crossing phase and the expanding - cooling phase .",
    "observationally , the two are separated by the peak of the optical flash .",
    "the evolution before the time of the optical peak , @xmath7 , is highly sensitive to the initial profile of the ejecta , namely to the density and the lorentz factor of the ejecta at the beginning of the rs crossing .",
    "thus the light curve before and at @xmath7 can be used as a diagnostic tool of these properties . on the other hand , the rs that crosses the shell erases , to a large extend , the initial shell profile .",
    "moreover , the evolution during the expanding and cooling phase depends only weakly on this profile ( @xcite )",
    ". therefore , the behavior after @xmath7 depends weakly on the initial conditions and as such it provides a very unique signature of an rs emission .",
    "swift is expected to provide detailed optical observation of the early afterglow . in some cases",
    "the observation is expected to start before @xmath7 and thus open a unique window into the properties of the ejecta ( in case that the ejecta is baryonic ) . moreover , here we show that if the prompt emission results from internal shock then the light curve of the early optical afterglow at @xmath8 is expected to be correlated with the prompt @xmath0-ray emission ( see fig .",
    "after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta , the shocked plasma cools and expand at the tail of the shocked external medium .",
    "kobayashi and sari ( @xcite ) explored this phase numerically and they have shown that the evolution of the hydrodynamical parameters in the cooling ejecta depends weekly on the strength of the reverse shock ( that in turn depends on the initial conditions of the ejecta ) . as a result the light curve during this phase depends on the initial conditions only by the relative values of the three reverse shock break frequencies at @xmath7 ( @xmath10 , the self - absorbtion frequency , @xmath11 , the synchrotron frequency and @xmath12 the cooling frequency ) . over a wide range of the parameter space ( assuming an ism @xcite . in this case",
    "the light curve evolution at @xmath9 is different than the evolution in an ism . ] ) these frequencies satisfy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the observed radio and optical frequencies respectively ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the optical light curve decays at @xmath9 as @xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the optical emission , the radio continues to rise at @xmath9 and it peaks at a later time , @xmath17 , when @xmath18 . over a wide range of initial conditions ( when the shock is not ultra relativistic ) @xmath19hz . in this case",
    "the radio emission is expected to rise first as @xmath20 until @xmath21 and then as @xmath22 until @xmath17 . at @xmath23 it is expected to decay , similarly to the optical emission , as @xmath16 .",
    "this behavior implies that : @xmath24 where @xmath25[@xmath26 is the peak optical [ radio ] flux ( at @xmath7[@xmath17 ] ) .",
    "@xmath28 is a factor of the order unity that arises due to uncertainty in the hydrodynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "this entire evolution provides several independent tests to verify that we observe a reverse shock emission .",
    "it provides also an independent measurement of @xmath29 : @xmath30 detailed radio observations at @xmath31 that identify the break during the rising phase , when @xmath32 would enable a determination of @xmath33 as well .",
    "the reverse shock emission during the time that the shock crosses the ejecta depends strongly on the strength of the shock , and in particular on the value of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the density of the ism and @xmath36 [ @xmath37 is the lorentz factor [ density ] of the ejecta .",
    "the density profile of the ejecta before the internal shocks is not smoothed by the shocks , on the contrary , a density contact discontinuity is produced whenever an internal shock occurs within the ejecta .",
    "therefore at the end of the internal shocks the density profile of the ejecta reflects the initial shells that produced the internal shocks .",
    "since the _ instantaneous _ emission of the rs depends strongly on the density of the ejecta it would vary strongly whenever the rs crosses a density discontinuity that remains from the internal shocks . as a result of the angular smoothing ( @xcite ) the _ observed _",
    "rs emission is an average of the _ instantaneous _ emission over a range of radii .",
    "this smoothing limits the variability time scale of the rs to be of the order of the observed time since the beginning of the prompt emission . therefore , if the prompt @xmath0-ray emission results from internal shocks , the rs optical light curve at @xmath8 is expected to resemble a smooth version of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission .    in order to demonstrate this relation between the prompt @xmath0-ray emission and the reverse shock light curve at @xmath8 we have carried out a one dimensional hydrodynamic numerical simulation , starting before the internal shocks and ending long after the reverse shock crossed the ejecta .",
    "the initial conditions are four shells with lorentz factors that vary between 60 and 240 with constant energy ( see the inset in the top panel of fig .",
    "the shells collide at a radius of @xmath38 cm and produce a prompt @xmath0-ray emission composed of two pulses with durations of approximately a second each .",
    "an illustration of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is depicted at the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 . having the hydrodynamic evolution of the ejecta and the external medium we used a detailed synchrotron radiation code to calculate the rs emission .",
    "the resulting optical light curve is depicted in the bottom panel of fig 1 .",
    "the similarity between the two light curves is clear .",
    "note also that in this specific case the optical reverse shock emission peaks long after the prompt @xmath0-ray emission ends .",
    "this delay is expected when the ejecta is thin . in this case",
    "the ejecta expands linearly with the radius between the internal shocks radius ( @xmath39 cm ) and the external shock radius ( @xmath40 cm ) .",
    "figure 1 shows also that after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta , @xmath9 , the optical light curve is insensitive to the complex initial profile of the ejecta and it decays as @xmath41 ."
