    "the inflationary stage of the very early universe explains the dynamical origin of the observed isotropic and homogeneous frw geometry .",

    "long - lasting inflation erases all classical anisotropies and inhomogeneities of the pre - inflationary stage",
    ". however , scalar and tensor vacuum fluctuations during inflation lead to almost scale free post - inflationary scalar and tensor metric inhomogeneities around our smooth observable frw patch .    in particular , the amplitude of the gravitational waves generated from the vacuum fluctuations during inflation is proportional to @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the reduced planck mass ) .",
    "there are significant efforts to measure the @xmath12-mode of @xmath13 polarizations , since this will provide a direct probe of the scale of inflation .",

    "limits on @xmath15 ( ratio of the tensor to scalar amplitudes of cosmological fluctuations ) @xmath16 ( wmap - only ) and @xmath17 ( wmap plus acoustic baryon oscillation , plus supernovae ) @xcite shall be improved to @xmath18 by the planck mission @xcite , to @xmath19 by the @xmath20over @xcite , ebex @xcite , and spider @xcite experiments ( see @xcite for the study of a mission that can improve over these limits ) . while these limits imply a detection in the case of high energy inflation , a number of other inflationary models , including many of the string theory constructions have lower energy , and therefore lead to gw of much smaller amplitude , which are virtually unobservable through @xmath12 mode polarization . up to the level @xmath21 with bbo @xcite or ultimate decigo @xcite direct detection experiments . ]    in anticipation of the null signal observation of the primordial gw from inflation , it is worth thinking about other implementations of this result for the theory of inflation , besides putting limits on the energy scale @xmath22 .",
    "there are models of inflation ( including many string theory inflationary models ) where the total number of e - folds , @xmath23 , does not exceed the minimum ( [ efold ] ) by a large number .",
    "if the extra number of e - folds @xmath24 beyond ( [ efold ] ) is relatively small then pre - inflationary inhomogeneities of the geometry are not erased completely , and their residuals can be subject to observational constraints . in the context of this idea , in this paper we suggest an additional mechanism to have observable gravitational waves associated with inflation .",
    "these gravitational waves are very different from the gw generated from the vacuum fluctuations during inflation .",
    "firstly , they are the residual tensor inhomogeneities from the pre - inflationary stage",
    ". secondly , they can be of a classical , rather than quantum , origin .",
    "thirdly , while their initial amplitude and spectrum are given by the initial conditions , they are significantly affected by the number of `` extra '' e - folds @xmath24",
    ". therefore , observational limits on gravity waves result in constraints on a combination of @xmath24 and of the initial amplitude .    the choice of the initial geometry of the universe before inflation is wide open . in principle , one may assume an arbitrary geometry with significant tensor inhomogeneities component , and much smaller scalar inhomogeneities .",
    "this choice is , however , very artificial .",
    "a much more comfortable choice of the pre - inflationary stage will be a generic anisotropic kasner - like geometry with small inhomogeneities around it .",
    "the origin of the anisotropic universe with the scalar field can be treated with quantum cosmology , or can be embedded in the modern context of the tunneling in the string theory landscape .",
    "in fact , a kasner - like ( bianchi i ) space was a rather typical choice in previous papers on pre - inflationary geometry , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "most of the works on an anisotropic pre - inflationary stage aimed to investigate how the initial anisotropy is diluted by the dynamics of the scalar field towards inflation @xcite .",
    "the formalism of linear fluctuations about an anisotropic geometry driven by a scalar field toward inflation was constructed only recently @xcite . besides the technical aspects of calculations of cosmological fluctuations",
    ", there is a substantial conceptual difference between computations in the standard inflationary setting and in the anisotropic case .",
    "for an isotropic space undergoing inflationary expansion , all the modes have an oscillator - like time - dependence at sufficiently early times , when their frequency coincides with their momentum .",
    "one can therefore use quantum initial conditions for these modes .",
    "this is no longer the case for an expansion starting from an initial kasner singularity . in this case ,",
    "a range of modes , which can potentially be observed today ( if @xmath24 is not too large ) , are not oscillating initially and therefore can not be quantized on the initial time hyper - surface ; as a consequence , there is an issue in providing the initial conditions for such modes .",
    "for this reason we will adopt another perspective , namely , we will consider generic small classical inhomogeneities around the homogeneous background , as an approximation to the more generic anisotropic and inhomogeneous cosmological solution .",
    "equipped with this philosophy , we consider an anisotropic expanding universe filled up by the scalar field with a potential @xmath25 which is typical for the string theory inflation .",
    "we add generic linear metric fluctuations about this geometry .",
    "the evolution of these fluctuations is by itself an interesting academic subject .",
    "however , it acquires a special significance in the context of the gw signals from inflation , because of a new effect that we report here of amplification of long - wavelength gw modes during the kasner expansion .",
    "this growth terminates when a mode enters the `` average '' hubble radius ( the average of that for all the three spatial directions ) , or , for larger wavelength modes , when the background geometry changes from anisotropic kasner to isotropic inflationary expansion .",
    "we perform explicit computations in the case of an isotropy of two spatial directions . in this case",
    "the computation becomes much more transparent and explicitly @xmath26 dependent .",
    "fluctuations for arbitrary @xmath27 were considered in the formalism of @xcite , where the @xmath26 dependence is not explicit .",
    "we verified that our results agree with @xcite in the axisymmetric @xmath28 limit .",
    "we find that only one of the two gw polarizations undergoes significant amplification .",
    "therefore , even if we assume for simplicity equi - partition of the amplitudes of the three inhomogeneous physical modes of the system ( the scalar and the two gw polarization ) at the initial time , the final spectra that will be frozen at large scales in the inflationary regime will be very different from each other , in strong contrast to what is obtained in the standard inflationary computations .",
    "this result can have different consequences , that we explore in the present work .",
    "suppose that the growing gw mode is still linear ( but significantly exceeds other modes ) when the space becomes isotropic .",
    "then , we can have significant yet linear classical gw fluctuations at the beginning of inflation , say of amplitude @xmath29 .",
    "if the modes which correspond to the largest scales that we can presently observe left the horizon after the first @xmath24 e - folds of inflation , their amplitude decreased by the factor @xmath30 in this period . if @xmath24 is relatively small , say @xmath31 the freeze out amplitude of these gw modes would be @xmath32 .",
    "the angular spectrum of these gw will rapidly decrease as the multipole number @xmath0 grows , since smaller angular scales are affected by modes which spend more time inside the horizon during the inflationary stage .",
    "suppose instead that the growing gw mode becomes non - linear before the onset of inflation .",
    "in this case the background geometry departs from the original onset .    besides the phenomenological signatures , it is interesting to study the origin of the amplification of the gw mode .",
    "it turns out that the effect of gw amplification is related to the anisotropic kasner stage of expansion .",
    "therefore we will separately study gw in the pure expanding kasner cosmology . for completeness",
    ", we also include the study of gw in a contracting kasner universe , which is especially interesting due to the universality of anisotropic kasner approach to singularity .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we discuss the evolution of the anisotropic universe driven by the scalar field towards inflation . in section  [ sec - linear ]",
    "we briefly review the formalism of the linear fluctuations in the case of a scalar field in an anisotropic geometry , paying particular attention to the gw modes . in section  [ sec : decoupled ]",

    "[ sec : obs ] we return to the cosmological set - up , and we compute the contribution of the gw polarization amplified during the anisotropic stage to the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "in particular , by requiring that the power in the quadrupole does not exceed the observed one , we set some limits on the initial amplitude of the perturbations vs. the duration of the inflationary stage . in section",
    "[ sec : sum ] we summarize the results and list some open questions following from the present study , which we plan to address in a future work .",
    "the anisotropic bianchi - i geometry is described by @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the scale factors for each of the three spatial directions .",
    "we consider a scalar field @xmath35 in this geometry .",
    "many string theory inflationary models ( for examples see @xcite ) have a very flat inflationary potential which changes abruptly around its minima .",
    "therefore , to mimic this situation , we will use a simple inflaton potential @xmath36 which has quadratic form @xmath37 around the minimum , and is almost flat @xmath38 away from it . to obtain the correct amplitude of scalar metric perturbations from inflation",
    ", we set @xmath39    the background dynamics is governed by the einstein equations for the scale factors in the presence of the effective cosmological constant @xmath40 , plus a possible contribution from the kinetic energy of the scalar field .",
    "quantum cosmology or tunneling models of the initial expansion favor a small scalar field velocity .",
    "therefore we select the small velocity initial conditions @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the generic solutions of the einstein equations with cosmological constant for @xmath42 are known analytically ( see e.g. @xcite ) and can be cast as @xmath43^{1/3 } \\ , \\left[\\tanh \\left(\\frac{3}{2}h_0 t \\right )    \\right]^{p_i-1/3 }   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath44 are the kasner indices , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the characteristic time - scale of isotropization by the cosmological constant , @xmath48 , while @xmath49 are the normalizations of the three scale factors    for earlier times @xmath50 the anisotropic regime is described by the vacuum kasner solution @xmath51 which corresponds to an overall expansion of the universe ( the average scale factor @xmath52 is increasing ) , although only two directions are expanding ( two positive @xmath44-s ) while the third one is contracting ( the remaining @xmath44 is negative ) .    for later time",
    "@xmath53 the universe is isotropic and expanding exponentially @xmath54 where the constant normalizations @xmath55 are typically chosen to be equal .",
    "it is instructive to follow the evolution of the curvature in the model .",
    "the ricci tensor is ( almost ) constant throughout the evolution up to the end of inflation @xmath56 at earlier times the weyl tensor ",
    "i.e. the anisotropic component of the curvature tensor  gives @xmath57 and , for @xmath50 , @xmath58 is much bigger than the isotropic components ( [ ricchi ] ) .",
    "this is why initially the contribution from the effective cosmological constant is negligible , and the vacuum kasner solution ( [ early ] ) is a good approximation . in contrast , at later times @xmath53 @xmath59 and the anisotropic part of the curvature becomes exponentially subdominant relative to its isotropic part driven by the cosmological constant .",
    "this is an illustration of the isotropization of the cosmological expansion produced by the scalar field potential .",
    "the timescale for the isotropization is @xmath60 .    in the following sections we will study the equations for the linear fluctuations around the background ( [ bianchi1 ] ) , ( [ factor ] ) .",
    "these equations become significantly simpler and more transparent for the particular choice of an axi - symmetric geometry e.g. when @xmath61 , and the metric is @xmath62 while the effect we will discuss is generic , for simplicity we will adopt the simpler geometry ( [ special ] ) rather than the general bianchi - i space ( [ bianchi1 ] ) . in this case , the early time solution is a kasner background with indices @xmath63 .. the solution is a very special one , since it is the only bianchi - i model with cosmological constant that is regular at @xmath64 ( as can be easily checked by computing the curvature invariants ; e.g. @xmath65 at @xmath66 ) . for @xmath67",
    ", this space is actually minkowski space - time in an accelerated frame . due to its special nature , we disregard this solution in the present study . ] also , it will be useful to define an `` average '' hubble parameter @xmath68 and difference @xmath69 between the expansion rates in @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) directions as @xmath73 at earlier times @xmath74 , while , at late times , @xmath75 .",

    "there is ambiguity in the choice of @xmath80 , related to possible different choices of the scale factors in its relation with the physical time .",

    "in the frw universe with a scalar field there are three physical modes of linear fluctuations .",

    "all three modes in the isotropic case are decoupled from each other .",
    "the formalism for the linear fluctuations on a frw background has been extended to the bianchi - i anisotropic geometry in @xcite .",
    "again , there are three physical modes ; however , in the general case of arbitrary @xmath92 the modes are mixed , i.e. their effective frequencies in the bi - linear action @xmath93 are not diagonal , as it is the case in the isotropic limit .    in a special case of the axi - symmetric bianchi i geometry ( [ special ] ) one of the three linear modes of fluctuations , namely , one of the gravity waves modes ,",
    "is decoupled from the other two .",
    "this makes the analysis of fluctuations much more transparent than the general @xmath94 case .",
    "while the effects we will discuss , we believe , is common for arbitrary @xmath92 , we will consider linear fluctuations around the geometry ( [ special ] ) .",
    "the computation follows the formalism of @xcite , where the reader is referred for more details .",

    "the two sets of modes are decoupled from each other at the linearized level .",
    "in addition , there is the perturbation of the inflaton field @xmath103 , which is also a @xmath98d scalar .    the gauge choice @xmath104 corresponding to @xmath105 , completely fixes the freedom of coordinate reparametrizations .",
    "it is convenient to work with the fourier decomposition of the linearized perturbations .",
    "we can therefore fix a comoving momentum @xmath106 , and study the evolutions of the modes having that momentum . since modes with different momenta are not coupled at the linearized level",
    ", this computation is exhaustive as long as we can solve the problem for any arbitrary value of @xmath106 .",
    "more precisely , we denote by @xmath107 the component of the momentum along the anisotropic @xmath70 direction , and by @xmath108 the component in the orthogonal @xmath109 plane .",
    "we denote by @xmath110 and by @xmath111 the corresponding components of the physical momentum .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath26 and @xmath2 the magnitudes of the comoving and physical momenta , respectively .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath112    to identify the physical modes , one has to compute the action of the system up to the second order in these linear perturbations .",
    "one finds that the modes @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , corresponding to the @xmath115 metric perturbations , are nondynamical , and can be integrated out of the action .",
    "this amounts in expressing the nondynamical fields ( through their equations of motion ) in terms of the dynamical ones , and in inserting these expressions back into the quadratic action .",
    "for instance , for the nondynamical @xmath98d vector mode one finds @xmath116 the analogous expressions for the @xmath98d nondynamical scalar modes can be found in @xcite .    in this way",
    ", one obtains an action in terms of the three remaining dynamical modes @xmath117 .",

    "therefore , the mode @xmath4 becomes the standard scalar mode variable @xcite , associated to the curvature perturbation , while the modes @xmath124 and @xmath122 are associated to the two polarizations of the gravitational waves .",
    "also notice that without the scalar field there are two physical modes which , due to the residual @xmath98d isotropy , are decoupled .",
    "since there are no vector sources , the @xmath98d vector system describes a polarization of a gravitational wave obeying the `` free field equations '' @xmath129 ( which reproduce the equation ( [ b3 ] ) and the first of ( [ evol ] ) ) .",
    "as we now show , this mode undergoes an amplification , which does not occur for the other two modes .",
    "this can be understood from considering the frequency of this mode @xmath130    in the isotropic case , for which @xmath131 is given by ( [ omegiso ] ) , each mode is deeply inside the horizon , @xmath132 , at asymptotically early times .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath68 is nearly constant , while @xmath133 is exponentially large at early times . as a consequence , @xmath134 in the asymptotic past , and the mode oscillates with constant amplitude . in the present case instead",
    "@xmath135 at early times ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "namely , as we go backwards in time towards the initial singularity , the anisotropic direction becomes large , and the corresponding component of the momentum of the mode is redshifted to negligible values . on the contrary ,",
    "the two isotropic directions become small , and the corresponding component of the momentum is blueshifted . however , the magnitude of the two hubble parameters increases even faster .",
    "therefore , provided we can go sufficiently close to the singularity , the early behavior of each mode is controlled by the negative term proportional to the hubble parameters in eq .",
    "( [ vec2dminus ] ) .    to be more precise ,",
    "if we denote by @xmath137 and @xmath138 the values of the two scale factors at some reference time @xmath139 close to the singularity , we have @xmath140 \\label{omegaapproxearly}\\ ] ] where the first term in the expansion comes from the terms proportional to @xmath141 in eq .",
    "( [ vec2dminus ] ) , while the second term from the component of the momentum in the isotropic plane ( cf . the early time dependences with those given in eq .",
    "( [ earlyph ] ) ) .",
    "we see that the frequency squared is negative close to the singularity , so that the mode @xmath122 experiences a growth . in a pure kasner geometry ,",
    "the relations ( [ earlyph ] ) hold at all times .",
    "therefore , one would find @xmath142 at asymptotically late times . for brevity",
    ", we will loosely say that the mode `` enters the two horizons @xmath143 '' at late times ; the meaning of this is simply that the frequency is controlled by the momentum in this regime , @xmath144 , and the mode @xmath122 enters in an oscillatory regime .",
    "this simple description is affected by two considerations : firstly , we do not set the initial conditions for the modes arbitrarily close to the singularity , but at some fixed initial time @xmath145 ; secondly , the geometry changes from ( nearly ) kasner to ( nearly ) de sitter due to the inflaton potential energy . consequently , there are three types of modes of cosmological size .",
    "i : modes with large momenta start inside the two horizons at @xmath145 .",
    "they oscillate ( @xmath146 ) all throughout the anisotropic regime , and they exit the horizon during the inflationary stage .",
    "ii : modes with intermediate momenta , for which ( [ omegaapproxearly ] ) is a good approximation at @xmath139 .",
    "these modes enter the horizons , and start oscillating , at some time @xmath147 during the kasner era ; they exit the horizon later during inflation .",
    "iii : modes with small momenta , that are always outside the horizons , and never oscillate during the kasner and inflationary regimes .",
    "these considerations are crucial for the quantization of these modes",
    ". we can perform the quantization only as long as @xmath146 , and the mode is in the oscillatory regime . as we mentioned , during inflation",
    ", this is always the case in the past .",
    "moreover , the frequency is adiabatically evolving ( @xmath148 ) , and one can set quantum initial conditions for the mode in the adiabatic vacuum .",
    "this procedure is at the base of the theory of cosmological perturbations , and results in a nearly scale invariant spectrum at late times , once the modes have exited the horizon and become classical . in the case at hand",
    ", we can not perform this procedure for modes of small momenta / large wavelength ( modes iii above ) .",
    "if inflation lasts sufficiently long , such modes are inflated to scales beyond the ones we can presently observe , so that the inability of providing initial quantum conditions is irrelevant for phenomenology .",
    "however , if inflation had a minimal duration , this problem potentially concerns the modes at the largest observable scales .",
    "irrespectively of the value of the frequency , it is natural to expect that the modes possess some `` classical '' initial value at @xmath145 . in the following",
    "we discuss the evolution of the perturbations starting with these initial conditions .",
    "although we do not have a predictive way to set these initial values , we can at least attempt to constrain them from observations .",
    "in addition , we should worry whether the growth of @xmath122 can result in a departure from the kasner regime beyond the perturbative level , in which case the background solution described in the previous section may become invalid ( we discuss this in section [ sec : kasner ] ) .",
    "as long as the frequency is accurately approximated by ( [ omegaapproxearly ] ) in the kasner regime , the evolution eq . for the mode @xmath122",
    "is approximately solved by @xmath149 +   c_2 \\ : \\sqrt{\\eta } \\ , y_3 \\left[2\\,k_t \\left(\\frac{a_0}{b_0}\\right)^{1/3 } \\sqrt{\\eta_0\\,\\eta}\\right ] \\label{solveccl}\\ ] ] where @xmath150 are two integration constants , while @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the bessel and neumann functions .",
    "the first mode increases at early times ( small argument in the bessel function ) @xmath153 , while the second one decreases as @xmath154 .",
    "we disregard the decreasing mode in the following computations , @xmath155 ( moreover , this mode diverges at the singularity ) .    rather than the time evolution of @xmath122",
    ", we show in figure [ evoltcl ] that of the corresponding power .",
    "we note the very different behavior obtained for large ( iii ) , intermediate ( ii ) , and small ( i ) scale modes .",
    "we choose to define the power spectrum as @xmath156 this definition coincides with the standard one ( see for instance @xcite ) as the universe becomes isotropic .",
    "in particular , the power spectrum is frozen at large scales in the isotropic inflationary regime .",
    "clearly , there is an ambiguity in this definition at early times , when the two scale factors differ ( there is no a - priori reason for the choice of the average scale factor in this definition ) .",
    "this arbitrariness affects the time behavior shown in the figure .",
    "however , it does not affect the relative behavior of the large vs. intermediate vs. small scale modes .",
    "moreover , if we analogously define the power spectra for the @xmath98d scalar modes , the relative behavior of these two types of mode ( figure [ evoltcl ] vs. figure [ evolpvcl ] ) is also unaffected by this arbitrary normalization .",
    "the reality of this instability is demonstrated in section [ sec : kasner ] , where we compute the squared weyl invariant due to these fluctuations ( more precisely , we do so in an exact kasner background , which , as we have remarked , coincides with the cosmological background at asymptotically early times ) .    in figure [ powertcl ]",
    "we show the power spectrum ( normalized to the initial value for each mode ) for the same background evolution as in the previous figure , at some late time during inflation , when all the modes shown are frozen outside the horizon . as the approximate solution ( [ solveccl ] ) indicates",
    ", the growth of @xmath122 occurs as long as the transverse momentum @xmath111 is smaller than the hubble rates @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , modes with smaller @xmath108 experience a larger growth .",
    "we denote by @xmath158 the angle between the comoving momentum , and the anisotropic direction , @xmath159 therefore , in general , we expect a greater growth at smaller values of @xmath26 ( for any fixed @xmath158 ) and at smaller values of @xmath158 ( for any fixed @xmath26 ) . and @xmath160 . ]",
    "this behavior is manifest in figure [ powertcl ] .",
    "modes with @xmath161 experience the same growth during the kasner era ( since the leading expression for @xmath131 is independent of the momentum in this regime ) .",
    "then , the modes shown in the figure exhibit a very strong @xmath162 dependence for @xmath163 .",
    "we also see an increase of the power as @xmath158 decreases .",
    "we stress that figure [ powertcl ] shows the contribution of each mode to the power spectrum normalized to the value that that contribution had at the initial time @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , if the original spectrum has a scale , or an angular dependence , this will modify the final spectrum ( for comparison , for the isotropic computation of modes with adiabatic quantum initial condition , @xmath164 at early times ) .    the large growth at small @xmath158 is more manifest in figure [ powerxi ] .",
    "the smallest angles shown in the figure correspond to @xmath165 , but to @xmath166 at the initial time ( this is due to the different behavior of the two scale factors in the anisotropic era ) . in this region ,",
    "the spectrum exhibits a milder @xmath167 dependence than for intermediate values of @xmath158 .",
    "finally , one may also consider smaller angles than those shown in the figure , for which @xmath168 initially .",
    "we have found that final spectrum becomes @xmath169independent in this region .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing how the growth scales with the initial time . as long as @xmath170 , the power ( [ powtimes ] ) of a mode grows as @xmath171 ( as can be easily seen by combining the time dependences @xmath172 ) .",

    "we also plot the evolutions of the @xmath124 mode considered in the appendix a(b ) .      how does the instability of gravitational waves which we demonstrated above fit with the classical picture of the universality of the rule of alternation of the kasner epochs during contraction towards a singularity ?",
    "let us briefly recall this picture .",
    "one of the points of the original paper @xcite was to extend the anisotropic homogeneous contracting kasner solution to a class of generalized kasner solutions , describing more general inhomogeneous anisotropic geometries .",
    "it was implicitly assumed that there are large - scale , super - horizon inhomogeneities at the scales exceeding the ( average ) hubble radius .",
    "generic anisotropic solution shall contain eight physically different arbitrary functions of the spatial coordinates .",
    "however , it was identified by @xcite that the homogeneous kasner solution is unstable against a particular inhomogeneous mode for which @xmath244 ( here @xmath245 is the kasner axes corresponding to the direction that is expanding ) . in other words ,",
    "this mode is unstable and is growing with time .",
    "therefore the monotonic ( stable ) inhomogeneous solution can have only seven arbitrary functions of the spatial coordinates .",
    "homogeneous kasner contraction ( in bianchi models with spatial curvature ) occurs in the stochastic regime of alternation of kasner exponents @xcite .",
    "this influenced the philosophy of inhomogeneous generalization of the kasner contraction .",
    "following @xcite , now one can allow all eight arbitrary functions to describe generalized kasner",
    "( bianchi i ) geometry . according to @xcite ,",
    "the backreaction of the growing mode of the spatial instability alters the kasner exponents of the patch of the contracting universe in the same manner as they were altered in the homogeneous kasner - oscillating universe .",
    "again , in this picture the inhomogeneity scale is larger than the `` hubble '' patch , so that locally , along the time geodesics , the contraction is asymptotically homogeneous @xcite .",
    "the instability induced by the spatial curvature associated with the inhomogeneous growing mode , and the resulting rotation of the kasner axes were rigorously studied with the mathematical tools of the theory of dynamical systems in @xcite .    in the previous section we found instabilities of both expanding and contracting kasner geometries against gravitational waves . here for comparison with the bkl analysis we focus on the gw instability in the contracting universe . in this background , both polarizations @xmath122 and",
    "@xmath124 are unstable in the large wavelength limit .",
    "all physical wavelengths of the gw corresponding to the momenta @xmath246 in different directions ( associated with different kasner exponents ) sooner or later will leave the hubble radius @xmath247 , independently of whether they are red- or blue - shifted .",
    "the physical frequency of the two modes has the structure @xmath248 , where the function @xmath249 is of order of @xmath141 . for small @xmath85",
    "this function dominates over the momenta terms ; this turns the time dependence of the gw amplitude from the oscillating to the non - oscillating regime .",
    "the amplitude of the non - oscillating gw increases with time in this long - wavelength regime , signaling the instability which we described in the previous section .",
    "it turns out ( see appendix [ appb ] ) that these unstable gw modes in the long - wavelength limit exactly coincide with the unstable solution @xmath244 found in @xcite .",
    "phrased in another way , the unstable solution of @xcite which destroys the monotonicity of the homogeneous kasner contraction is nothing but the gw polarizations that are evolving with time into the long - wavelength regime .",
    "this provides us with a new insight into the origin of the generalized inhomogeneous contracting kasner solution : small short - wavelength gw will eventually be stretched to become the long - wavelength inhomogeneous modes , which are unstable .",
    "equipped with the bkl conjecture , one may think that for the contracting universe the growth of the unstable gw modes results in an alternation of the kasner exponents . while this conjecture is supported for a contracting universe @xcite , it is not clear how the gw instability evolves for the expanding kasner background .",
    "indeed , for contracting kasner universe gw leave the hubble radius and become long - wavelength inhomogeneities , and their backreaction can be described by the impact of the spatial curvature at the `` local '' time evolution of @xmath34 . for an expanding universe , initially long - wavelength gw enter the hubble radius .",
    "their backreaction can be treated with the pseudo - tensor @xmath250 for the high - frequency gw .",
    "another interesting issue is how our unstable modes correspond to the perturbatively small variations of the kasner exponents ( giving contribution to the diagonal metric fluctuations ) as well as small variations of the kasner axes ( contribution to off - diagonal metric fluctuations ) .",
    "finally , one of the most interesting application of the effect is related to zero vacuum fluctuations of gravitons in contracting kasner geometry , which are unstable .",
    "they grow and become large scale classical gw inhomogeneities described by the random gaussian field .",
    "one may think that the kasner axes will be altered and rotated differently in different spatial domains of that random field .",
    "we will expand these considerations in a forthcoming investigation .",
    "the growth of the decoupled tensor polarization at large scales can leave an imprint in the amplitude and in the polarization of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "a characteristic signature is a non - diagonal correlation between different multipoles in the expansion of the anisotropies , due to initial background anisotropy .",
    "such extended phenomenological study is beyond the goals of the present work .",
    "however , we want to obtain a crude estimate on the limits that such a study would impose on the model , namely on the physical wavelength beyond which the statistics of the modes is anisotropic , and on the initial amplitude of the gw signal . for this reason",

    "backreaction of this unstable mode is conjectured to alter the kasner exponents , differently in different spatial patches , depending on the spatial profile of the initial gw .",
    "the kasner geometry is a rather universal asymptotic solution for many interesting situations : it describes approach towards black holes or cosmological singularities ( including higher dimensional and supersymmetric cases @xcite ) , and it describes generic anisotropic expansion from singularity prior to inflation .    all of these situations are inevitably accompanied by quantum fluctuations of the gravitons ) , and , possibly , also by classical gravitational waves .",

    "we considered the effect of gw instability in the context of the anisotropic pre - inflationary stage .",
    "the transition from kasner expansion to inflation terminates the effect of gw instability but leaves classical gw signal as the initial conditions for inflation .",
    "if inflation does not last very long , then the residual gw can contribute to the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "since gw polarizations and the scalar mode of cosmological fluctuations behave differently during anisotropic pre - inflation , we can consider only the leading contribution , namely , @xmath122 mode of the gw polarization . in this paper we calculated its contribution to the total @xmath13 anisotropy angular power spectrum .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the signal decreases with @xmath0 in a power - law manner and depends on the initial spectrum of the classical gw fluctuations , @xmath293 , where the exponent @xmath2 depends on the power - spectrum of the classical gw at the initial hypersurface .",
    "it is interesting to note that this result is qualitatively similar to the result of @xcite , where the impact of gw from the our - universe - bubble nucleation was considered .",
    "the signal from @xmath122 is rather anisotropic , and there is an interesting question about the anisotropy of its multipole structure @xmath296 , which is intriguing in connection with an apparent alignment of the low multipoles of @xmath13 .",
