    "diffuse non - thermal synchrotron radio emission is found in a significant fraction of galaxy clusters @xcite , which indicates that there exist both the relativistic electrons and magnetic field as well as the thermal intracluster medium ( icm ) in the intracluster space .",
    "some of such diffuse radio sources are located near the center and cover the cluster entirely , which are called `` radio halos '' .",
    "others are located at periphery and called `` radio relics '' .    although the origin of these non - thermal electrons is still unclear , some connections of radio halos and relics with dynamical motion of icm are reported .",
    "for example , they are rarely found in cool core clusters @xcite .",
    "radio luminosity has strong correlation with x - ray one and icm temperature @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite shows the correlation of the radio power with asymmetry of the x - ray image .",
    "it is likely that such non - thermal electrons are accelerated via shocks @xcite and/or turbulence @xcite in the icm associated with cluster mergers .",
    "magnetic field plays a crucial role in these acceleration processes .",
    "however , it is not so easy to determine cluster magnetic field strength and structures in an observational way .",
    "faraday rotation measure observations of polarized radio sources in and/or behind clusters are often used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "however , the results strongly depend on the magnetic field structures themselves . moreover , it can be applied for very limited regions where we have suitable polarized radio sources by chance , though this will be possibly resolved by using cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as the polarized sources @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very important to estimate the magnetic field strength through another independent method .",
    "gev electrons in radio halos and relics are expected to emit non - thermal hard x - ray via inverse compton process of cmb photons . comparing the synchrotron radio flux and inverse compton hard x - ray one ( or its upper limit ) , we are able to estimate volume - averaged magnetic field strength ( or its lower limit ) .",
    "however , it is very difficult to detect such components because of a large amount of thermal emission from the icm .",
    "although a lot of efforts have been made to detect the non - thermal inverse compton component from clusters of galaxies , the situation is still unclear .",
    "for example , detection of non - thermal hard x - ray from the coma cluster were reported from the beppo - sax pds @xcite and rxte @xcite data , but their reliability is still controversial @xcite .",
    "recently , in addition , @xcite show the lower limit that conflicts with the former detection reports through combined analysis of suzaku and xmm .",
    "therefore , firm detection or reliable upper limits of non - thermal components in the hard x - ray regime are highly desired by independent instruments .",
    "abell 2319 is one of the most well - known examples of merging clusters with a giant radio halo .",
    "two subgroups , a2319a and a2319b , are recognized in radial velocity distribution of the member galaxies , which suggests that the merger axis is nearly along the line - of - sight and that the velocity difference between them is almost 3000 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite studies temperature structures in a relatively large scale and finds that the temperature in the region corresponding to the a2319b is lower .",
    "chandra observations reveal inhomogeneous temperature structures and a cold front in the central region , and show that the position of the x - ray center is different than that of the cd galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , it is obvious that the cluster is not dynamically relaxed .",
    "a2319 has a giant radio halo , and the radio and thermal x - ray distributions are quite similar to each other @xcite .",
    "observations in the hard x - ray band are performed by beppo - sax @xcite , rxte @xcite , and swift - bat @xcite , any of which do not report firm detection of non - thermal components .",
    "the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) on board suzaku @xcite is superior in order to investigate hard x - ray properties of galaxy clusters because of its low detector background and narrow field of view @xcite .",
    "indeed , improved constraint for non - thermal components has been obtained for several clusters @xcite , and very hot components ( @xmath7 20 kev ) were found in rxj1347.5 - 1145 @xcite and a3667 @xcite .",
    "in addition , high spectral resolution of the xis @xcite on board suzaku makes it possible to constrain the bulk flow motion of the icm that is likely relevant to the particle acceleration processes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present suzaku observation of the abell 2319 cluster to investigate dynamical status of the icm and hard x - ray properties , which enables us to understand particle acceleration processes and the origin of the radio halo .",
    "the canonical cosmological parameters of @xmath8 mpc@xmath1 km s@xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are used in this paper . because the cluster mean redshift is @xmath11 , 1 corresponds to 62 kpc .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all uncertainties are given at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the observation and data reduction . in ",
    "3 we present the spectral analysis results . in  4 we discuss the results and their implications . in ",
    "5 we summarize the results .",
    "we observed the central region of abell 2319 with suzaku on 2006 october 27 - 30 for an exposure time of 100 ks .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of suzaku xis , and that of hxd pin in which the throughput of the fine - collimator becomes 50 % are shown in a rosat pspc image ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "an approximate position of the a2319b subgroup is also shown .",
    "the observation was performed at hxd nominal pointing . as a result ,",
    "most of the a2319b is not within the xis fov .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode .",
    "the edit mode was 3 @xmath12 3 and 5 @xmath12 5 , and we used the combined data of both modes .",
    "a half of the 64 pins of the hxd were operated in the nominal bias voltage of 500 v , and the others were done in that of 400 v. all the data was processed with the suzaku pipeline processing of version 2.0.6.13 .",
    "we employed the calibration data files of 20081009 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1small.eps    the xis data were processed through standard criteria as follows .",
    "events with a grade of 0,2,3,4,6 and status with 0:524287 were extracted .",
    "we exclude the data obtained at the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , within 436 sec after the passage of saa , and at the low elevation angles from the earth rim of @xmath13 and the sun - lit earth rim of @xmath14 . as a result",
    ", effective exposure time becomes 99.5 ks for xis .",
    "non x - ray background ( nxb ) spectra and images of xis were generated using the ftool `` xisnxbgen '' @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] represents the 0.5 - 8.0 kev xis image combined from those of the front illuminated ( fi ) ccds ( xis0 , xis2 , xis3 ) .",
    "the images were corrected for exposure and vignetting effects after subtracting nxb , and smoothed by a gaussian kernel with @xmath15 arcmin .",

    "the resultant effective exposure time is 94.0 ks . as the nxb of the pin",
    ", we used a public nxb model provided by the hxd team in the suzaku website .",
    "the version of the model is `` method = lcfitdt '' , or `` tuned '' @xcite .",
    "the cxb level is estimated in the same way as @xcite from the lockman hole observation ( suzaku observation i d , 101002010 ) .",
    "the detailed procedure is described in appendix 2 of @xcite .",
    "we defined the photon flux model as @xmath16 in photons @xmath2",
    "s@xmath1 kev@xmath1 fov@xmath1 , where @xmath17 is the photon energy in kev .",
    "for spectral analysis of the xis data , rmf and arf files are generated using the ftool `` xisrmfgen '' and `` xissimarfgen '' , respectively .",
    "the rosat pspc image of the a2319 is used to make arf files , considering that the xis fov does not cover the cluster icm emission entirely and that suzaku has only moderate spatial resolution .",
    "the cluster icm emission in the xis fov is so bright that the background components from astrophysical origin such as cxb and galactic diffuse components are safely negligible .",
    "we use an rmf file provided by the hxd team in the caldb for pin spectral analysis . a pin arf file",
    "are made in the same way of @xcite ; we calculate it by convolving the point source arf assuming that the spatial distribution of the emission is the same as that of the rosat pspc image .",
    "detailed description is written in subsection 2.4 of @xcite .",
    "temperature and abundance structures can provide us with basic and crucial information about the icm dynamics and its origin . to explore this",
    ", we divide the region observed with xis into 15 regions presented in figure [ fig3 ] and perform spectral analysis for each region .",
    "the sizes of the divided region are 3 @xmath12 3 and 6 @xmath12 6 for the cluster center and surrounding regions , respectively .",
    "fi ccd spectra and related response files for each region are summed , and fi and back illuminated ( bi ) ccd spectra are fitted simultaneously . for the spectral fitting , we use the energy band of 0.6  10.0 kev and 0.6  8.0 kev for xis fi and bi , respectively , though the energy band near the si edge ( 1.7  1.9 kev ) is ignored to avoid uncalibrated structures . each spectrum",
    "is fitted by the photoabsorbed single temperature apec model ( wabs @xmath12 apec ) , assuming that @xmath18 @xmath2 @xcite and that redshift=0.0557 @xcite .",
    "the fitting results are presented in table [ tab : kt_abun ] . in general , each data are fitted well with the above - mentioned model .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the resultant temperature and metal abundance for the regions presented in figure [ fig3 ] , respectively . the central south - east regions ( region 2 , 3 , and",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     a2319 was observed by beppo - sax pds in the hard x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the obtained upper limit flux of the power - law component in the energy band of 13 - 50 kev is 2.3 @xmath19 or 2.0 @xmath19 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 , depending on the adopted radio spectral index 0.92 ( 408 - 610 mhz ) or 2.2 ( 610 - 1420 mhz ) , respectively .",
    "different radio spectral indexes are used because the pds results rely on higher energy band than pin . when these results are compared with ours ,",
    "however , it should be noted that the crab s 20 - 80 kev flux derived from beppo - sax pds is 21 % smaller than that derived from suzaku .",
    "thus , the above - mentioned beppo - sax results can be converted into suzaku - equivalent fluxes of 2.9 @xmath19 or 2.5 @xmath19 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 for the radio spectral index 0.92 or 2.2 , respectively .",
    "these results seem to be similar to our results of the @xmath20 model at first glance .",
    "however , please remember that hxd pin fov is much narrower than beppo - sax pds , which is preferable in order to avoid contamination sources , but large enough to cover the a2319 radio halo entirely .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the hard x - ray properties of 10 galaxy clusters including abell 2319 using swift - bat .",
    "the obtained upper limit of the power - law component in the energy band of 10 - 40 kev is 2.9 @xmath21 or 1.7 @xmath21 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 with a radio spectral index 0.92 through swift - bat alone or swift - bat + xmm - newton analysis , respectively . here",
    ", their original values at the @xmath22 confidence level in the energy band of 50 - 100 kev are converted into those at the 90% confidence level in the 10 - 40 kev band . considering that a2319 has relatively high temperature ( @xmath23 kev ) and that swift - bat , with its long exposure , has better sensitivity in the higher energy band ( @xmath24 kev ) than suzaku pin , it is not so surprising that their results give tighter constraint .",
    "suzaku is superior in determining the thermal properties , thanks to its high sensitivity around 20 - 40 kev .",
    "we note that their power - law `` upper - limit '' is quite low , much less than those inferred from the sensitivity .",
    "their sensitivity plot shows @xmath7 1 mcrab , or @xmath25 at 10 - 40 kev , as a 3-sigma sensitivity , or even worse above 100 kev .",
    "thus , swift - bat is presenting @xmath7 2 or less @xmath21 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 upper - limit using the detector with a 90% confidence sensitivity of @xmath7 7 @xmath21 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "this is of course allowed in some cases , especially when the photon statistics favors negative flux .",
    "anyway , our results , independently obtained , are consistent with theirs .",
    "we would also like to point out that the swift alone analysis lacks soft x - ray spectral information important to determine thermal component precisely , and that generally speaking cross - calibration between detectors onboard different satellites ( such as xmm and bat ) is not so easy . as we wrote before , asca results @xcite suggest there is lower temperature ( @xmath26 kev ) icm in the outer region without xis but within pin fov , though this is not clear in beppo - sax results @xcite .",
    "the existence of this cold icm could affect the estimation of the upper limit of the power - law component . to evaluate this",
    ", we make the spectra assuming that the outer region ( @xmath27 ) has 8 kev and perform joint spectrum analysis of xis and pin in a similar way in subsection 3.3 .",
    "the resultant flux of the power - law component in 10 - 40 kev increases by @xmath28 and @xmath29 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 for the @xmath30 models with a photon index 1.92 and 2.4 , respectively .",
    "these values are smaller than both the statistical errors and those induced by background uncertainty , as listed in table 6 .",
    "this effect shall affect the beppo - sax pds results as well .      from the observed results",
    ", we can get information about the energy densities of the thermal icm , non - thermal electrons , and magnetic field in the intracluster space of the a2319 , which are basic and important parameters for the cluster structure and evolution . for simplicity , we assume that the radio halo region is a sphere with a radius 0.66 mpc . with @xmath31-model parameters obtained by rosat @xcite and @xmath32 kev , energy density of",
    "the thermal icm becomes @xmath33 ev @xmath34 . from the upper limit of an inverse compton component of the @xmath20 model in table [ tab : uplimfl ] ,",
    "we obtain the energy density of the relativistic electrons corresponding to 10 - 40 kev hard x - ray ( or , @xmath35 ) @xmath36 ev @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 , though in this calculation we do not consider the contribution from relatively low energy electrons , which could be dominant in the energy density of the non - thermal electron populations . with the lower limit of the magnetic field for the @xmath20 model in table [ tab : lowlimmag ] ,",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field becomes @xmath38 ev @xmath34 , which means @xmath39 .      in this subsection ,",
    "let us discuss a particle acceleration scenario of the a2319 implied by the xis and hxd results mentioned above .",
    "the xis results tell us two important points as follows .",
    "first , the central cool region associated with the cold front have higher metal abundance , which suggests that this might be an old remnant of a subcluster s cool core that infalls in the past .",
    "second , icm velocity difference in the observed region is probably subsonic , which means that no definitive shocks are expected there .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that there is not a significant very hot component from the xis+hxd analysis . on the other hand , existence of subsonic turbulence",
    "( @xmath40 km s@xmath1 ) can be allowed .",
    "therefore , it is more likely that non - thermal electrons relevant to the radio halo of the a2319 are accelerated by the intracluster turbulence rather than the shocks .",
    "the turbulence is probably excited by the past merger activity , which is also responsible for the cold front and central cool core with higher abundance .",
    "this picture is also consistent with the fact that numerical simulations show that the turbulence motion is developed in the late phase of mergers @xcite .",
    "the discussion on the energy budget in the previous subsection shows that the magnetic field energy density is likely much less than the hydrodynamical turbulence , which means that the magnetic turbulence can be easily excited @xcite .",
    "although a collision between the subgroup a2319a and a2319b is likely supersonic , it does not seem to form sufficiently strong shocks to excite the radio halo activity .",
    "it is probable that they are not so close to each other that sufficiently strong shocks occur .",
    "we obtained only an upper limit of the icm line - of - sight velocity difference . to resolve the intracluster turbulence",
    "( @xmath40 km s@xmath1 ) , a different type of x - ray spectrometer than ccd is highly desired .",
    "the astro - h satellite @xcite , which is planned to be launched around 2013 , will enable us to measure the line - of - sight velocity directly with the x - ray microcalorimeters and provide us with useful information on the dynamical status of the icm .",
    "astro - h is also planed to have hard x - ray mirrors and imager , which enable us to get hard x - ray images at very high sensitivity .",
    "this gives us very important clues to understand where and how the particle acceleration processes occur in the intracluster space .",
    "we observed the central region of the abell 2319 with suzaku . from the xis analysis",
    ", we found that the central cool region in the north - west of the cold front has higher metal abundance than the surrounding region for the first time .",
    "we measure the line - of - sight velocities of the icm with xis and find that the velocity difference is less than @xmath7 2000 km s@xmath1 , which means that the icm motion is probably subsonic . in addition , we show that the velocities in the observed region are consistent with those of entire a2319 and a2319a subgroup for the first time .",
    "no signs of icm motion related to a2319b subgroup are found .",
    "if the icm associated with the a2319b subgroup has the similar velocity of a2319b member galaxies , a supersonic collision is expected in the icm . from the xis+hxd wide band spectral analysis , we search for very hot and non - thermal inverse compton components . there can be a little amount of very hot ( @xmath7 15 kev ) component , but it does not have to exist .",
    "no significant inverse compton component is detected , and we derive its upper limit for several spectral models .",
    "typically , it becomes @xmath41 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 , which is consistent with the recent swift - bat results . comparing the synchrotron radio flux and upper limit of the inverse compton one ,",
    "we obtain the lower limit of the magnetic field strength @xmath42 g , though the results slightly depend upon the spectral modeling . taking into account of the lack of the supersonic icm motion and a very hot component ,",
    "we conclude that the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio halo of the abell 2319 are more likely accelerated by the turbulence rather than shocks .",
    "the authors would like to thank k. matsushita and s. shibata for helpful comments , and an anonymous referee for his / her useful comments and constructive suggestions .",
    "we are also grateful to the suzaku operations team for their support in planning and executing this observation .",

    "<S> although the results slightly depend on the detailed spectral modeling , it is robust that the upper limit of the power - law component flux and lower limit of the magnetic field strength become @xmath4 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath5 g , respectively . considering the lack of a significant amount of very hot ( @xmath6 kev ) gas and the strong bulk flow motion , it is more likely that the relativistic non - thermal electrons responsible for the radio halo are accelerated through the intracluster turbulence rather than the shocks . </S>"
