    "as a solvable example of a statistical system exhibiting a second order phase transition , the ising model has been of central importance in the development of statistical mechanics and still continues to play a key role as test ground for new theoretical and computational methods .",
    "the existence of a curie point , at which a transition from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase takes place , as the temperature is lowered , was first proven to exist by peierls @xcite in the case of the square lattice ising model . successively kramers and wannier @xcite calculated the value of the critical temperature using duality and the property of the square lattice of being self - dual . with the first calculation of the zero field free energy by onsager @xcite and the calculation of the spontaneous magnetization by yang @xcite ,",
    "the second order character of the phase transition was established .",
    "this successful attempt to solve the ising model on a square lattice was carried over using transfer matrix techniques . along the same path , wannier was first to study the triangular and hexagonal ( also called honeycomb ) lattice ising model , in particular in relation to antiferromagnetism studies @xcite . the first non regular lattice zero field",
    "free energy was calculated for the `` kagome '' lattice by kano and naya @xcite .",
    "successively the `` extended kagome '' lattice was studied by soyzi @xcite .",
    "the `` union jack '' lattice and the dual , the `` bathroom - tile '' lattice , were covered by @xcite .",
    "other lattices were investigated in @xcite .",
    "a combinatorial approach to solve the ising model was proposed by kac and ward @xcite .",
    "it is based on the possibility to map the high temperature expansion of the partition function onto a particular random - walk problem on the lattice .",
    "feynman @xcite and vodvicenko @xcite showed how to recover the onsager solution by this method .",
    "the above mapping is based on a topological theorem about loops on two dimensional lattices proven by sherman @xcite .    despite of many efforts ,",
    "the free energy in presence of a non - zero external magnetic field has not yet been calculated exactly .",
    "some results are available only at criticality @xmath0 or for weak magnetic field @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "still nowadays the ising model is an active area of research .    in this prospect",
    "any exact analytical result can be useful .",
    "in this paper we use the combinatorial method to calculate the curie temperatures for the ising model on all archimedean lattices and all their duals , the laves lattices .",
    "this method was first used by thompson and wardrop @xcite to calculate the critical temperatures for two archimedean lattices , here we calculate the curie temperature for all of them , including three values which were known by now only approximately from monte carlo simulations .",
    "archimedean lattices are uniform tilings of the plane in which all the faces are regular polygons and the symmetry group acts transitively on the vertices .",
    "it follows that all vertices are equivalent and have the same coordination number @xmath2 .",
    "also , all vertices are shared by the same set of polygons and thus we can associate to each archimedean lattice a set of integers @xmath3 indicating , in cyclic order , the polygons meeting at a given vertex @xcite .",
    "when a polygon appears more than one time consecutively , for example as in @xmath4 , we abbreviate the notation writing @xmath5 .",
    "+        in this way , the uniform tilings of the plane , made with squares , triangles and hexagons , are indicated respectively by @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is possible to show , that apart the regular tilings just listed , there are eight other uniform tilings of the plane .",
    "this are all constructed using more than one regular polygon and are shown in figure 1 . in total",
    "we have eleven different two dimensional archimedean lattices .",
    "some of this lattices have names : `` kagome '' @xmath9 , `` extended kagome '' @xmath10 and `` bathroom - tile '' @xmath11 , while the others have no particular name .",
    "note that the lattice @xmath12 is the only non - specular one .",
    "the dual lattice @xmath13 of a given lattice @xmath14 is constructed associating a vertex of @xmath13 to each face of @xmath14 .",
    "the duals of the archimedean lattices are called laves lattices .",
    "they are tilings of the plane made with one non - regular polygon and are indicated by the notation @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the square lattice is self - dual @xmath16=(4^{4})$ ] ( this property was used by kramers and wannier to first calculate the critical temperature for this lattice ) , while the triangular and hexagonal lattices are dual of each other @xmath17=(6^{3})$ ] , @xmath18=(3^{6})$ ] . of the duals of the other uniform lattices , three are triangular tilings , two are rhomboidal tilings and three are pentagonal tilings .",
    "the dual of the kagome lattice @xmath19 $ ] is called `` dice lattice '' and the lattice @xmath20 $ ] , dual to the  bathroom tile  lattice , is called `` union jack '' lattice .",
    "we briefly review the definition of the model and the basic steps involved in the combinatorial solution of it . at every lattice site @xmath21",
    "a spin variable @xmath22 is located and a microstate is defined by a spin configuration @xmath23 .",
    "nearest neighbor interactions are assumed so that the energy of a given spin configuration is given by @xmath24 if @xmath25 the interaction is ferromagnetic , while it is antiferromagnetic if @xmath26 .",
    "for the aim of calculating the curie temperature , we can set to zero the external applied magnetic field @xmath27 . the partition function is the sum over all spin configurations , weighted by the boltzman - gibbs factor @xmath28 we defined @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .    using the high temperature expansion , the partition function ( [ part ] ) ,",
    "can be rewritten as : @xmath31 in ( [ 2.1 ] ) we defined @xmath32 , while @xmath33 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath34 is the number of links per lattice site .",
    "the function @xmath35 is the generating function of the numbers @xmath36 ( we define @xmath37 ) , which count the graphs of length @xmath38 with even vertices that can be drawn on the lattice @xmath14 . in this way",
    ", the problem of solving the ising model on @xmath14 is reduced to the combinatorial problem of counting even closed graphs on @xmath14 .",
    "if we do nt care about the fact that we have to count only over closed graphs with even vertices , we can use the standard combinatorial property that the sum over all ( possibly disconnected ) closed graphs , is given by the exponential of the sum over only connected closed graphs . but",
    "connected closed graphs can be seen as closed random - walk paths .",
    "if we find a way to consider in the sum only closed paths with even vertices , we have a way to calculate the generating function @xmath35 simply by counting closed random - walks paths .",
    "feynman @xcite and vodvicenko @xcite introduced a trick to count only over paths with even vertices : weight the random - walk with a complex amplitude @xmath39 at every turn of angle @xmath40 the random - walker makes along his trajectory . in this way all contributions coming from non - even paths delete each other in the sum , and the mapping from the high temperature expansion to the random - walk problem works out correctly ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this results have a rigorous base on a topological theorem proven by sherman @xcite and were further investigated by morita @xcite .    after introducing the appropriate amplitudes , which depend on the properties of the lattice @xmath14",
    ", we need to count all connected closed graphs of length @xmath38 that can be draw on @xmath14 .",
    "this number is equal to the number of random - walks of length @xmath38 starting from all the lattice sites @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of walks arriving at site @xmath43 from direction @xmath21 at the @xmath38-th step starting from site @xmath44 .",
    "the sum is over all possible starting points and the factor @xmath45 exclude the over - counting due to the fact that there are two directions in which a graph can be travelled and the fact that each graph can be seen as a random - walk starting from all of the sites of the lattice reached by the random - walker .",
    "the random - walk problem can be written in terms of the master equation    .coordination number @xmath2 , number of lattice sites per unit cell @xmath46 and size @xmath47 of the random - walk matrix @xmath48 for each archimedean lattice . [ cols=\"<,<,^,<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the critical temperatures @xmath49 are related to the high temperature parameter @xmath50 by the following relation : @xmath51 the values we found are given in the collum 4 of table 3 .",
    "the exact curie temperatures for all the lattices , except for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath12 , were already known in the literature . in particular , they can be found in the following references : @xmath6 in @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xcite , @xmath10 in @xcite , @xmath11 in @xcite , @xmath9 in @xcite , @xmath54 in @xcite and @xmath55 in @xcite .",
    "we have compared our exact results for the lattices @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath12 with the numerical values available from monte carlo simulations @xcite and they agree within numerical errors .",
    "this is an independent confirmation of the correctness of our analytical calculations for this new critical values .",
    "the critical temperatures for the lattices @xmath55 and @xmath54 were calculated in @xcite using the same combinatorial approach we are using , and agree with our findings .",
    "the fact that we used lattices where all edges are of unit length , contrary to @xcite who used a different `` embedding '' of the lattices by constructing them from a square lattice adding diagonal links , shows that the critical temperatures depend only on the topology of the lattice and not on the particular representation of it .",
    "in fact , different embeddings of the same lattice lead to different random - walk matrices @xmath56 .",
    "this give rise to different polynomials @xmath57 , that instead have the same roots in the interval @xmath58 .",
    "the fact that the curie temperatures depend only on the topology of the lattice is understood from the fact that the function @xmath35 , which counts the number of closed even graphs , is a topological property of the lattice which is independent of the embedding .",
    "note that the lattices @xmath53 and @xmath9 have the same curie temperature .",
    "this comes from the fact that the relative polynomials @xmath59 and @xmath60 have a common factor with root in the interval @xmath58 .",
    "this may suggest that the critical probabilities @xmath61 for correlated percolation ( also know as bootstrap percolation ) on this lattices are equal .    using the critical values for the high temperature parameter @xmath50 found for the archimedean lattices , we can calculate the curie temperatures for the laves lattices from the relation : @xmath62 which follows from duality , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the values of the curie temperatures for the dual lattices @xmath13 are reported in collum 5 of table 3 .",
    "we calculated the exact curie temperatures for the two dimensional ising model on all archimedean and laves lattices using the combinatorial approach of feynman and vodvicenko .",
    "this results are summarized in table 3 . in the particular case of the lattices @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath12 and their duals",
    "@xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath65 $ ] our results were known in the literature only approximately from monte carlo simulations .",
    "this numerical results agree , within errors , with our analytical findings .",
    "the universal character of the phase transition is reflected in the singularity of the free energy , which is logarithmic ( @xmath66 ) for all lattices .",
    "the curie temperatures are not universal and we checked that they depend only on the topology of the lattice , but not on the particular embedding of it .",
    "the table of critical temperatures we compiled can be a useful reference to future numerical and theoretical work on the ising model on a large class of two dimensional lattices .",
