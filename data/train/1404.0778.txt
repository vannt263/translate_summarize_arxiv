    "gravity is a gauge theory that any formulation of gravity should remains invariant under a special class of gauge transformations , from this perspective gravity is similar to electrodynamics .",

    "also there is no realiable explanation for the fundamental forces of the nature .",
    "along with providing general relativity ( gr ) another model for gravity introduced by einstein in which the gravity was not curvature effect of the spacetime but the torsion of the spacetime explained gravity . in this formulation",

    "conformal transformation of a lorentzian metric @xmath10 is a local transformation that acts on the metric @xmath11 and converts it to the new metric @xmath12 , in such transformations @xmath13 is a piecewise continous and non singular function entirely spacetime .",
    "it is assumed that the second order derivatives of @xmath13 is well defined . in this framework , we are required to provide a set of orthogonal basis vectors @xmath14 so that the metric is written as : @xmath15 by applying conformal transformations into metric the transformation spreads to each of the following basis : @xmath16 with above transformation , we are able to build major blocks of weitzenbck spacetime with torsion , the first quantity is : @xmath17 transformation property of basis @xmath18 leads to the following transformations for @xmath19 : @xmath20 the rank three tensor can be defined the following vector quantity : @xmath21 under transformations , the vector will change as follows : @xmath22 from above vector quantity we can define a vector in the spacetime frame : @xmath23 using the transformation properties of the basis we have : @xmath24 the expression @xmath25 is not only possible to construct a vector in the spacetime frame and other components can be tested .",
    "however , untill we have reviewed , @xmath25 is the simplest possible .",
    "now we able to introduce lagrangian term which remains invariant under conformal transformations . for a better understanding ,",
    "we consider the following series of scalar quantities under the conformal transformation :    @xmath26    the simplest combination of the above terms as follows is essential for making invariant lagrangian and plays the key role in our theory : @xmath27 the expression ( [ tau ] ) converts into @xmath28 and the most simple proposal is the following teleparallel lagrangian : @xmath29 it is straighforward ro show that expression ( [ l1 ] ) is invariant : @xmath30 another lagrangian proposed by maluf , which includes auxiliary scalar field @xmath31 which changes under conformal transformation as follows : @xmath32 lagrangian considering the scalar field ( one dgree of freedom ) is as follows : @xmath33\\label{l2}.\\ ] ] @xmath34 in the ( [ l2 ] ) is a free coupling constant and the derivative for the scalar field is defined as follows :    @xmath35    it is not hard to show that @xmath36",
    ". then ( [ l2 ] ) is invariant under conformal transformations .",
    "the lagrangians ( [ l1]),([l2 ] ) are not only examples for conformal invariances , for example following lagrangian is invariant : @xmath37 in which : @xmath38 @xmath39 the only constraints are that coefficents @xmath40 must be satisfy in the following equations : @xmath41 our main goal in this paper is to finding cosmological solutions for ( [ l1],[l2 ] ) .",
    "in this section we will investigate the equations of motion for model ( [ l1 ] ) .",
    "inspired by the cosmological data , the simplest model of universe is a flat and homogenous and isotropic model frw . simple and suitable tetrads basis for metric is : @xmath43 non - zero components of fundamental tensor are : @xmath44 components can be expressed as follows : @xmath45 components of the vector @xmath46 can be immediately written as : @xmath47 give the @xmath48 we can write : @xmath49 we should compute components of @xmath19 for the final form of @xmath50 : @xmath51 using these components we can list elements of @xmath52 : @xmath53 finally,@xmath54 can be written as follows : @xmath55 using the symmetry properties of @xmath19 we can calculate the following : @xmath56 and finally obtained : @xmath57 point like form of ( [ l1 ] ) in the frw universe have simple form as follows : @xmath58 here s a type about the matter in the frw equations .",
    "first , we note that the perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath59,breaks the conformal symmetry .",
    "if you want to add matter fields to the ( [ l1 ] ) , should be added a lagrangian form ( [ l1 ] ) which is respect to conformal symmetry .",
    "it means the lagrangian of matter fields must be invariant under the transformations : @xmath60 as the simplest example , radiation is a simple and handy but it is not only example of such matters .",
    "infact , to make the frw universe , can build a simple form of lagrangian of matter fields .",
    "such a simple form is as follows : @xmath61 above lagrangian is invariant because as we know @xmath62 as a result : @xmath63    if we want solve frw equations for ( [ l1]),the solution is complex . to avoid mathematical complexity , we confine ourselves to the @xmath64 .",
    "and we find accurate solutions for the equations .",
    "the modified frw equations can be written in terms of effective quantities : @xmath65 in which : @xmath66},\\label{rho - eff}\\\\ & & p_{eff}=-h^2(1-\\frac{fa}{2f'})\\label{p - eff}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ frw1 ] ) and by using the ( [ frw2 ] ) @xmath67    now we annalyze the continuty equation of this particular model .",
    "continuty equation for a perfect fluid in any model of cosmology which has frw equations ( [ frw1]),([frw2 ] ) is as follows : @xmath68 in case ( [ l1 ] ) regardless of the gravity model is written based on torsion , the form of continuty equation is written without changing .",
    "therefore , with effective quatities @xmath69 the energy conservation equation remains unchanged . to find the exact solution of frw in the vacuum , we rewrite the second frw as follows : @xmath70 by change of variable @xmath71 , equationo ( [ eom1 ] )",
    "become as follows : @xmath72 and the exact solutions of ( [ xeq ] ) is : @xmath73{\\frac{c_1}{|f(a)|}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is convenient to rewrite the solution in terms of the redshift @xmath74 , @xmath75{c_1}\\frac{(1+z)^{3/4}}{\\sqrt{|3-\\frac{9}{2(1+z)^6}|}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cosmological solution of model ( [ l1 ] ) is vacuum .",
    "thus , the compatiability of our model with realistic models we compare the solution @xmath76 with @xmath0cdm . @xmath77 our model at @xmath78 gives :    @xmath79    in the vicinity of @xmath78 : @xmath80    @xmath0cdm is :    @xmath81    dimensionless the hubble parameter is to devide both sides of equation on @xmath82 and : @xmath83 so : @xmath84 that : @xmath85 in the vicinity of @xmath78,@xmath0cdm gives the following expression : @xmath86 thus in the prsent time our model is in good agreement with @xmath0cdm and the final graph shows a good match . for better comparison with the @xmath87 data , the @xmath88",
    "have been plotted in terms of the theoretical result of @xmath76 .",
    "the second example is a scalar - torsion which is given by ( [ l2 ] ) .",
    "here we are reminded that the ( [ l2 ] ) remains invariant by @xmath1,however obtaining accurate solution for such model by @xmath89 is a difficult task and so we limited talk to a scalar field without potential .",
    "lagrangian point like frw is as follows : @xmath90,\\\\ & & h = h(a)=3-\\frac{9}{2}a^6.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations of motion are modified klein - gordon by covariant derivative and both equations are frw : @xmath91 the first frw equation is as follows : @xmath92dt }   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to find an analytical solution of a analytical function , we define an analytical assisted auxiliarly function as follows : @xmath93 : @xmath94 for further simplifications , effective tortoise coordinate is defined as follows : @xmath95 and the simplified configuration lagrangian is : @xmath96 euler - lagrange equations for @xmath97 can be written as follows : @xmath98    above equations are severaly dissipative and fully non linear and the only possible solution for the equations is numerically .",
    "an exact solution for the case slowly varying @xmath99 field ( @xmath100 ) is obtained by solving the following equation and analytical methods in the inflationary models : @xmath101 which has non specific answer as follows : @xmath102{b   ( t ) ^{3}{\\omega}^{2}}+6c_2\\sqrt [ 3 ] {    b ( t ) ^{3}{\\omega}^{2}}=0,\\\\ & & z(t)=\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{k''}}b(t)^{3/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remind that there is no simple way to find general solutions of @xmath103 .",
