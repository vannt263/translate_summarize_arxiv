    "attributing a scalar quantity to each space - time point , scalar fields are one of the simplest fields possible . often used in effective descriptions or serving as simpler toy models of physical phenomena , they , however , arise as well as fundamental constituents of many theoretical physics models .",
    "the prime example is string theory , which contains scalar fields as fundamental pieces of its scaffolding .",
    "indeed , in many models beyond the standard model of particle physics , a scalar field , the dilaton , appears as an irreducible representation of the first excited states @xcite .",
    "scalar fields also arise naturally in other theories like in kaluza - klein theory , where gravity and electrodynamics can be formulated as different manifestations of the gravitational field in a five - dimensional space - time . after dimensional reduction to four space - time dimensions",
    ", a scalar field appears @xcite .",
    "scalar fields can also be found in supergravity theories as auxiliary fields ensuring off - shell realizations of supersymmetry @xcite and in several cosmological models in order to drive inflation or being part of dark matter models @xcite .",
    "a very appealing case is the starobinsky model which is conformally equivalent to gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field @xcite . in this model , the massive scalar state , usually called scalaron , possesses a very particular potential able to drive the inflationary process of the early universe , describing a slow - roll transition from a de - sitter phase to a minkowski flat phase . due to the wide variety of applications and due to the discovery of a fundamental scalar particle in nature @xcite",
    ", scalar fields have been studied increasingly in the past years .",
    "+ in classical theories ( as opposed to quantum theories ) for scalar fields , soliton configurations are of particular relevance .",
    "a soliton refers to a non - singular solution of a non - linear equation which , after collecting all its features , can be pictured as a travelling wave of ( almost ) unchangeable shape , whose energy remains finite in a finite region of space , so that it resembles a localised lump .",
    "the interesting feature concerning these solutions is that even as classical waves , they behave in many aspects like particles , especially when their scattering is considered @xcite .",
    "+ the concept of solitons was introduced in the context of a scalar field theory in @xmath0dimensional minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "the stability of the solutions in this particular model is explained by the high number of constraints ( in fact , there are infinitely many of them ) that this solution has to satisfy .",
    "these constraints appear as conserved charges - in principle , completely unrelated to noether charges - and , being infinitely many , they define the theory as integrable .",
    "such an integrability concept , however , does not go beyond one spatial dimension , not to mention the difficulties in discussing it in curved space(-time ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , in higher dimensions there are soliton - like configuration , i.e. , solutions of the field equations in the form of localised lumps .",
    "it is the integrable structure of certain non - linear field theories that enables the development of methods for construction of soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "since such structure is not present for theories in higher dimensional space - time , there are no well established analytical methods to get the solitonic solutions there , and therefore most of these solutions are obtained numerically . + for spatial dimension larger than one topological solitons possess an invariant that classifies the mapping between two manifolds @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the manifold of the degrees of freedom of the solution with local coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 the physical @xmath8dimensional space with local coordinates @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "this topological invariant , also referred to as topological charge , is the pull - back in @xmath5 of a volume form @xmath11 in @xmath7 normalised to unity and reads : @xmath12 + thus , the time evolution of a configuration is viewed as an homotopy between its initial and final state and the solitons are characterised in an equivalence class of maps @xmath13 .",
    "+ the possibility of existence of pure scalar field solitons in more than one spatial dimension is ruled out by derrick s theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so , in higher dimensions , a theory that exhibits solitons involves other fields ( e.g. gauge fields ) as well .",
    "another possibility is that the scalar field has internal degrees of freedom , e.g. a non - trivial phase .",
    "+ indeed , this last option gives rise to so - called _ @xmath3-balls _",
    "these configurations are soliton solutions of a complex scalar field theory which interacts through a suitable self - interaction potential .",
    "they are non - topological in nature @xcite and it is the invariance of the action under global phase transformations of the scalar field which endorses the theory with a conserved noether charge @xmath3 interpreted as the particle number .",
    "once the theory is gauged , this noether charge multiplied by the coupling constant of the gauge field becomes the total charge of the soliton .",
    "rotating and non - rotating @xmath3-balls have been shown to exist with polynomial self - interaction containing up to 6th order terms @xcite as well as for an exponential self - interaction potential motivated by supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "+ gravitating solitons in this context , namely _ boson stars _ , do not require self - interaction of the scalar field .",
    "indeed boson stars can be constructed with a scalar field potential possessing only a mass term @xcite . due to bounds on the maximal mass of this configurations",
    "they are usually referred to as _ minimal boson stars_. in @xcite it was found that boson stars with masses of the order of astrophysical objects can be obtained including quartic self - interactions without collapsing into black holes .",
    "these studies were extended to include a 6th order term in the scalar field self - interaction potential @xcite as well as exponential self - interaction potentials @xcite . recently",
    "a very important application of this kind of configuration has been developed .",
    "in @xcite the authors were able to construct kerr black holes with scalar hair through a very particular interaction of rotating minimal boson stars and kerr black holes .",
    "they have shown that once both configurations co - rotate synchronously it is possible to add hair onto the kerr black holes .",
    "the mass of this new family of black holes is bounded by the mass of minimal boson stars . in a subsequently work @xcite the authors constructed and analyzed mass bounds and the size of the horizon of this kind of configurations when quartic self - interactions are included , in analogy to what was done in @xcite for boson stars .",
    "boson stars have been constructed in several models including rotation , a cosmological constant and modified gravity theories as well as higher dimensional scenarios @xcite .",
    "+ charged versions in both cases have attracted considerable attention as well , @xcite .",
    "once electromagnetic charge is introduced , the coulomb electrostatic repulsion destabilizes large charged @xmath3-balls @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated for polynomial potentials @xcite that there exists a maximum charge and size for these configurations ( see also @xcite for a recent study ) . attempts to construct large charged @xmath3-balls including a v - shaped potential @xcite or even adding fermions @xcite were given , but in all theses cases limitations on the maximum charge and size were found .",
    "some advance in this direction was done in @xcite motivated by potentials belonging to the so  called affleck - dine mechanism .",
    "the formation of @xmath3-balls in this context was also investigated @xcite .",
    "+ the self - interaction potential normally used to construct @xmath3-balls and boson star is a 6th order polynomial potential in the modulus of the complex scalar field . up to a rescaling , there is a unique choice of such a self - interaction potential which possesses  in addition  degenerate vacua . in this paper",
    "we construct @xmath3-balls and boson stars in the context of such a potential with degenerate vacua .",
    "we will report on the qualitative and quantitative properties of the solutions and compare our results with those given in @xcite for charged @xmath3-balls and boson stars with a scalar mass term only .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give the model and discuss the possible soliton solutions ( topological and non - topological , respectively ) . in section 3 , we discuss the case of one spatial dimension and review what is known about solutions there . in section 4 , we will discuss solutions in three spatial dimensions . in this latter case ,",
    "the non - topological solitons have to be constructed numerically both in flat as well as in curved space - time . in section 5",
    "we conclude and summarize our results .",
    "in the following we will discuss a scalar field model with a 6th order self - interaction potential whose action reads ( in units such that @xmath14 ) @xmath15 with scalar field potential @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes the determinant of the metric tensor . in the following the signature of the metric",
    "is chosen to be @xmath19 .",
    "note that there are already implicit rescalings here . in principle , the value one in ( [ potential ] ) should be replaced by an energy scale @xmath20 ( which would correspond to the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field ) , but we can rescale @xmath21 such that it is measured in units of this energy scale . moreover , we have set the overall factor in front of the potential to unity .",
    "this is nothing else but letting the mass of the scalar field @xmath22 be equal to unity .",
    "the potential ( [ potential ] ) has three degenerate minima at @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to interesting phenomena as far as soliton solutions are concerned .",
    "let us mention that potentials with degenerate vacua also play an important rle in the context of an effective description of the confinement / deconfinement phase transition in quantum chromodynamics ( see e.g. @xcite for the construction of soliton solutions in such an effective model ) .",
    "parametrizing the complex scalar field as @xmath24 where , in general , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be functions of the @xmath27 coordinates , we are interested in the following two cases    1 .",

    "the choice of potential ( [ potential ] ) allows for the existence of _ non - topological solitons _ called @xmath3-balls @xcite with scalar field @xmath32 tending to zero at spatial infinity .",
    "these solutions exist for all @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 : in this case the scalar field is real and there exists no longer a @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the interesting solutions are quite different from the @xmath3-balls : instead of looking for configurations that tend to zero at infinity we focus on those that link the different vacua of the potential @xmath35 . these solutions are _",
    "topological solitons_. here the situation changes dramatically because the existence of such configurations is highly constrained by the number of spatial dimensions . for the model given in we only have topological solitons for @xmath36 and they are characterised by their topological charge : @xmath37 \\ .\\ ] ] the notion of soliton solutions in curved space - time is far from being easily generalised from the one in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the topological charge , however , can be directly extended ( as given above ) once the topological current in flat space @xmath38 is also covariantly zero : @xmath39 in relativistic theories in flat @xmath0dimensional space - time the soliton energy @xmath40 ( and with that , of course , the mass @xmath41 ) resembles the mass of a particle @xcite , specially due to its behaviour under transformations between inertial frames which move with speed @xmath42 relative to each other : @xmath43 .",
    "when gravity is also present , the intrinsic difficulty in general relativity concerning the definition of a locally conserved energy makes this `` soliton - mass '' not well defined , and this is a serious issue in defining topological solitons in curved space - time .",
    "scalar field models in @xmath0 dimensions have been studied extensively due to a variety of soliton solutions that exist in these models .",

    "let us remark that these solutions are not strictly solitons because of their behaviour when they undergo collision processes ( see the discussion in @xcite for the @xmath55model ) .",

    "the non - topological solutions existing in this model are @xmath3-balls with a globally conserved noether charge . in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions",
    "the solutions can be given explicitly @xcite , while in more than one spatial dimension they have to be constructed numerically .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to present our results on the construction of these @xmath3-ball solutions in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "in contrast to the topological solitons , these non - topological solitons have finite energy . we have also extended our results to include a minimal coupling to gravity and electromagnetism , respectively . in the former case ,",

    ", we can hence also conjecture  not surprisingly  that the kink - antikink solution is linearly unstable .",
    "it is interesting to see whether these features persist for other type of potentials such as the @xmath173-potential in which kink solutions have been constructed @xcite as well as the exponential potential appearing in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",

    "nature of the latter in the sense that no annihilation takes place in the collision and the solitons keep their initial velocities after the collision .",
    "it was already observed some time ago that kink - antikink collisions in non - integrable models are in contrast inelastic . this has been studied thoroughly in the @xmath55-model @xcite and it was attributed to the fact that the @xmath55-model possesses internal modes that can be excited , which the sine - gordon model does not possess .",
    "kink - antikink collisions in the @xmath50 case have been studied recently with view to this point @xcite and it was found that the @xmath50 model behaves in many aspects similar to the @xmath55-model .",
    "we would like to emphasize , though , that the @xmath50-model is different from the @xmath55-model in the sense that only the former possesses @xmath3-balls solutions .",
    "hence , it is conceivable that in the collision of @xmath50 kinks and antikinks ( which should both asymptote to zero ) @xmath3-balls get formed .",
    "the fact that this is not seen in the papers mentioned above is likely due to the fact that only linear perturbations about the kink and anti - kink , respectively , have been taken into account .",
    "we conjecture that when allowing for non - linear perturbations , the @xmath3-balls will form .",
