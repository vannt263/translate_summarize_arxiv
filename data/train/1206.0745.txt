    "blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) characterized by highly luminous and rapidly variable continuum emission at all observed bands .",
    "the most commonly accepted scenario has their broad - band emission doppler - boosted by a relativistic jet pointing close to our line of sight  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the jet emission usually dominates the observed broad - band spectrum , the optical / ultra - violet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) spectra often also reveal signatures of the central engine : broad emission lines , and in some cases , quasi - thermal optical / uv emission and ir dust emission , indicating the presence of an accreting supermassive black hole .",
    "most viable current models for the origin of such jets involve conversion of the gravitational energy of matter flowing onto the black hole to the kinetic energy of the relativistic outflow or tapping the rotation energy of a spinning black hole",
    ". however , the conversion process itself is not well understood , and many additional questions regarding the dissipation region of the jet s energy into radiation and , in particular , its location remain unanswered .",
    "major advances in understanding of blazars came as a result of the discovery by the egret instrument on board _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ that they are strong @xmath0-ray emitters , with @xmath0-rays dominating radiative output  @xcite . with this , multi - band observations including the @xmath0-ray band hold the promise of answering many outstanding questions regarding the structure of the relativistic jets of blazars .",

    "those values are similar to the estimates based on the luminosity of the host galaxy  @xcite .",
    "3c  279 contains a compact radio core , associated with time - variable jet - like structure .",
    "radio observations at 43 ghz by very long baseline array ( vlba ) between 1998 march and 2001 april revealed superluminal motion of the jet with apparent speeds that range from @xmath17 to @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "those observations also allowed an estimate of the lorentz factor of the jet flow of @xmath19 and of the viewing angle of the jet @xmath20 deg , corresponding to a doppler beaming factor of @xmath21 .",
    "a change of the trajectory of a jet component has also been reported in radio observations with vlba  @xcite .",
    "those authors estimated the jet component to be moving with a lorentz factor @xmath22 at an initial viewing angle of @xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source is characterized by a two - bump structure , similar to many other @xmath0-ray blazars . in the context of widely accepted leptonic models , the lower - frequency bump , peaking at the far - ir and extending to the extreme uv band ,",
    "is commonly ascribed to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the second bump , spanning from the x - ray to the @xmath0-ray band with a peak in the mev - gev range , is believed to be generated via inverse - compton scattering , presumably by the same population of particles that radiate at lower energies via the synchrotron process .",
    "the seed photons for the compton scattering can be synchrotron photons  ( synchrotron self - compton : ssc , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , accretion disk photons  ( external compton scattering of direct disk radiation : ecd , * ? ? ?",

    "those authors explained the overall spectra using the leptonic model , where the x - ray photons are mainly produced by ssc , and both ecd and ecc contribute to the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "spectral variability was explained by variations of the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , accompanied by changes in the spectral shape of the electron distribution .",
    "the optical variability of 3c  279 is extreme : in 1937 , it showed optical ( @xmath25 ) magnitude of 11.27  @xcite , making it one of the most luminous active galaxies ever recorded .",
    "the strong variability recorded in all bands provides an opportunity to establish the relationship between emission in those bands , and thus can be used to constrain theoretical models of physical regions of the jet responsible for such emission .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but they have not revealed a simple relationship between the variability in various bands : radiation in different spectral regimes does not always rise and fall simultaneously , although the periods of increased rapid activity in all bands seem to last for several months , and take place when the source is relatively bright .",
    "a recent paper by @xcite presents the results of the monitoring of 3c  279 for 11 years in radio , optical and x - rays , and discusses the details of the jet structure based on multi - band correlation studies .",
    "however , due to the lack of deployed instruments , long term monitoring observations could not include the @xmath0-ray regime , where the source often shows stronger variability than in other bands .",

    "the hxd nominal position was used for the observations to maximize its effective area . in the following analysis ,",
    "the hxd / gso data were not used because there was no significant detection of the source .    although the observation conditions were nominal , the xis1 data suffered from somewhat high and variable background , resulting in the total apparent counting rate ranging from 1 to 3 counts s@xmath14 in source - free regions for the entire chip .",

    "for the analysis of spectra and light curves , we extracted the counts from a region corresponding to a circle with 260 radius , centered on the x - ray centroid ; we used a region of a comparable size from the same chip to extract the background counts .",
    "the net count rates were 0.47 , 0.63 , and 0.56 count s@xmath14 for xis0 , xis1 , and xis3 , respectively , with the typical count rate uncertainty in the entire observations of @xmath152 .",

    "the same electron population , of roughly the same energies , is responsible for the radiation in both the optical and @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "there , the observed lag can result from different profiles of the decreasing magnetic and radiation energy densities along the jet : we show that idea quantitatively in appendix a. as is shown there , a very steep drop of the external radiation energy density is required to explain the lag in a conical jet with magnetic field @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the distance along the jet .",

    "in such a case , the magnetic field intensity can drop more slowly than @xmath283 .",
    "if the lag of the optical emission is confirmed , the application of the results in appendix a to the @xmath153-day lag may imply the location of the active `` blazar zone '' at distances of a few pc in agreement with those postulated to explain the optical polarization swing ( period d - e ) in terms of a region containing an enhanced density of ultra - relativistic electrons propagating along a curved trajectory ( paper i ) .",

    "variability appears to be much less rapid , and the excess variance ( @xmath46 ; see definition in eq .",
    "[ eq : vari ] ) in the radio regime is quite modest : for instance , @xmath284 at 37ghz , @xmath285 at 15ghz and @xmath286 at 5 ghz .",
    "those values are significantly less than ones in the @xmath0-ray or optical bands .",
    "this suggests that the synchrotron emission from the @xmath0-ray emitting region is self - absorbed at these wavelengths .",
    "the observed radiation is produced at much larger distances , where the light - travel effects smear out the sharp , rapid variability patterns observed in the optical and @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "perhaps the most surprising behavior - and difficult to explain in the context of simple , one - component , single - zone models - is the relationship of the x - ray light curve to those in the ir - optical or @xmath0-ray bands . in paper",
    "i , we reported that the x - ray time series exhibits a relatively rapid , symmetrical flare at @xmath37 mjd  54950 ( period f ) with a duration of @xmath287 days , which is _ not _ accompanied with any prominent ir / optical or @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "as we argued in paper i , the hard ( rising in @xmath258 representation ) x - ray spectrum is unlikely to be the `` tail '' of the synchrotron emission , but instead , it is more likely to be produced by the low - energy end of the electron distribution radiating via inverse compton process .",
    "the continuing monitoring of the object in the x - ray band revealed another x - ray flare at @xmath37mjd  55040 * ( period g ) * , @xmath1 days after the first x - ray flare .",
    "the separation of the two x - ray flares is remarkably close to the temporal separation of the two @xmath0-ray flares , with the two pairs delayed with respect to each other by @xmath288 days .",
    "figure  [ fig : dcfgx ] presents the calculated dcf between @xmath0-ray and x - ray fluxes , which shows a modest peak at @xmath289 day with a correlation coefficient of 0.60.7 and indicates no correlation between the the @xmath0-ray and the x - ray bands with zero lag .",
    "while confirming the physical connection of the two pairs would be very important , we can not currently envision any situation where the two would be causally connected : the @xmath290-day lag would imply the distance of the x - ray flare production @xmath291 pc and at such a distance should be accompanied by radio flares , which are not seen in our data . in such a scenario ,",
    "the x - ray flares should be significantly broadened compared to the @xmath0-ray flares , however , we observe a similar temporal structure in both bands .",
    "furthermore , we note that there are some optical and @xmath0-ray peaks that might well be associated with the second x - ray flare .",
    "hence , it is possible that the two prominent @xmath0-ray / optical flares ( period b and d ) , together with the subsequent two x - ray flares ( period f and g ) , form a sequence of 4 events separated by a similar time intervals .",
    "those intervals , in turn , can be possibly determined by instabilities in the jet launching region . here",
    ", the different broad band spectra during these events may result from small changes of parameters , such as the jet direction , lorentz factor , and/or location and geometry of the dissipation event .",
    "a weak ( and sporadically almost absent ) correlation between x - rays and other spectral bands can also result from such processes which preferably contribute to radiation in the x - ray band .",
    "they can be related to the following three mechanisms / scenarios :    1 .   bulk - compton process .",
    "this involves compton - scattering of ambient optical / uv light by the _ cold _ ( non - relativistic ) electrons in the jet .",
    "this mechanism is most efficient close to the accreting black hole where the processes responsible for the variability of x - rays may operate independently of those at larger distances and producing there variable non - thermal radiation  @xcite . a drawback of this scenario can be that the bulk - compton spectrum is predicted to have a similar shape as the spectrum of the external radiation field  @xcite , which significantly differs from what we observe in the x - ray band .",
    "inefficient electron acceleration . acceleration of the relativistic electrons at proton - mediated shocks is likely to proceed in two steps : in the first one low - energy electrons may be pre - accelerated via , for example , some collective processes involving protons ; in the second step , they may participate in the first - order fermi acceleration process .",
    "if under some conditions the electron - proton coupling is inefficient , the fraction of electrons reaching the fermi phase of acceleration will be small . in this case the x - rays , originating from lower energy electrons , are produced efficiently , while the @xmath0-rays and optical radiation which involve more relativistic electrons - are not .",
    "the x - rays can be also contributed by hadronic processes , specifically by the pair cascades powered by protons losing their energy in the photo - mesonic process  @xcite . for this process to be efficient",
    ", it requires extreme conditions  @xcite , however , operating in the very compact central region , at distances less than few hundred gravitational radii , it may occasionally dominate in the x - ray band .",

    "the synchrotron peak is located in the mid - ir band , at a frequency one order of magnitude higher than in the low state .",
    "this indicates that there are two independent synchrotron bumps , possibly produced at different locations .",
    "the mid - ir - peaking component , seen only in the ir / optical / uv flaring state , is characterized by a strong and rapid variability .",
    "the mm / sub - mm peaking component is more persistent and dominates when the source is in the low state .",
    "the complex shape of the sed between the mm band and the @xmath301 point in period d requires a coexistence of these two components .",
    "a similar scenario of multiple synchrotron components was investigated in the case of 3c  454.3 by @xcite .    in the x - ray band , despite the smaller variability amplitude , we observe some spectral changes . in particular , in periods f and g , which represent the two isolated x - ray flares , the spectrum is very similar and harder than on average .",
    "figure [ allsedone ] shows that these flares are not energetically important .",
    "if we extrapolate the x - ray spectra with power laws to the @xmath0-ray band , we under - predict the observed @xmath0-ray flux in periods b , c , d and h. periods b , c , d coincide with the high - activity @xmath0-ray state .",

    ", the possible scenarios of the x - ray flares may involve changes of the source parameters such as the jet direction , lorentz factor , and/or location of the dissipation event , or may require more exotic solutions , for instance : bulk - compton process ; inefficient electron acceleration above a given energy ; hadronic processes . at this stage",
