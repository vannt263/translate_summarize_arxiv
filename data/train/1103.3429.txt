    ".    in one - dimensional ( 1d ) superconductors , one particular kind of excitation , the so - called quantum - phase slip ( qps ) processes , have been recently the focus of an intense research.@xcite the interest is based both on the putative role of qps in the sit in 1d@xcite , as well as for their potential uses in novel qubit architectures@xcite , a fact that has stimulated recent interesting experimental research in 1djjas.@xcite a phase - slip is a discrete process occuring in a 1d superconductor , in which the amplitude of the order parameter vanishes temporarily at a particular point , allowing the phase of the order parameter to change abruptly in units of @xmath2 . in particular , a _ _ qps is a phase - slip excitation originated in macroscopic quantum tunneling of the phase of the order parameter .",

    "we believe this is a consequence of a different kind of dissipation in the model .",
    "we find that , except in the experimentally challenging situation in which the cooper - pair density in the superconducting islands is not commensurate , the sit is always of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type,@xcite and is originated in the unbinding of qps / anti - qps pairs .",
