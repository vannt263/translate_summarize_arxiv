    "in photoionized nebulae both h  ii regions and planetary nebulae ( pne) optical recombination lines ( orls ) provide abundance values that are systematically larger than those obtained using collisionally excited lines ( cels ) ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , and references therein ) .",
    "this is known as the _ abundance discrepancy problem_. it is one of the major unresolved problems in nebular astrophysics , being known of for more than seventy years @xcite , and has far - reaching consequences on the measurement of abundances throughout the universe , most often measured using cels from ionized gas .",
    "the abundance discrepancy factor ( _ adf _ ) is defined as the ratio between the abundances derived from orls and cels and is usually between 1.5 and 3 ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but in pne it has a significant tail extending to much larger values . it has recently been shown that the largest abundance discrepancy factors ( up to @xmath2300 ) , are reached in pne with close binary central stars that have undergone a common envelope ( ce ) phase @xcite .",
    "the data presented in these papers support the hypothesis that two different gas phases may coexist @xcite : hot , standard metallicity gas at @xmath210000 k where the cels can be efficiently excited , and much cooler ( @xmath21000 k ) gas clumps with a highly enhanced content of heavy elements ( which is the cause of the cooling ) where only orls form . as this dual nature is not predicted by mass loss theories , these results have added a new , unexpected ingredient to the abundance discrepancy problem : very high discrepancy factors should be explained in the framework of ( interacting ) binary evolution . some of the proposed explanations are naturally linked to binarity , such as for instance high - metallicity nova - like ejecta @xcite .",
    "other appealing explanations involve the presence of planetary debris that survived the whole evolution of the central star , or the tidal destruction , accretion and ejection of jupiter - like planets ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is difficult at this stage to favor any scenario because observational constraints are still very scarce .",
    "the existing long - slit studies point out that the plasma emitting in o  ii orls ( the brightest metal orls in the optical spectrum ) is generally more concentrated in the central parts of the nebulae than the cel emitting zones of the same ion ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , no direct imaging of the gas component where the bulk of the metal orls is emitted has ever been attempted , mainly because o  ii orls are faint and suitable filters are generally not available .",
    "ngc  6778 ( @xmath1 = 19@xmath3 18@xmath4 24.94@xmath5 , @xmath6 = @xmath701@xmath8",
    "35@xmath9 47.641@xmath10 , png034.506.7 ) was found to show unusually strong orls reflecting a high _ adf _ value ( average value @xmath220 , see * ? ? ?",
    "it hosts a close binary central star with an orbital period of 3.7 hours , making it one of the shortest period binary central stars known @xcite . in the present work , we take advantage of the large collecting area of the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) telescope and its blue tunable filter ( btf ) to study the 2d emission profiles of the o  ii orl and [ o  iii ] cels for the first time .",
    "we obtained narrow band imagery of ngc6778 using the optical system for imaging and low resolution integrated spectroscopy ( osiris , @xcite ) on the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma .",
    "the osiris detector consists of a mosaic of two marconi ccds , each with 2048 @xmath11 4096 pixels and a total unvignetted field of view of @xmath12 arcmin@xmath13 , giving a plate scale of 0.127 arcsec / pix .",
    "we selected the 2@xmath112 binning mode and the 200 khz readout mode .",
    "we used the osiris blue tunable filter ( btf ) for our observations .",
    "it consists of a fabry - perot etalon which allows narrow band imaging at a selected wavelength .",
    "however , fabry - perot etalons cause a radial wavelength dependence in the form of `` rings '' of constant wavelength centred on the optical axis .",
    "therefore , in order to sample the pn o  ii emission at 4649 + 50  , the btf tuning was displaced to 465.4@xmath140.2 nm , with an effective bandpass of 0.85 nm .",
    "this ensures that the wavelength selection is the desired one to isolate o  ii emission when the target is located 1 arcmin from the tf optical center .",
    "there was no need to scan the tf as the nebula is sufficiently small ( @xmath1525 arcsec diameter excluding the faintest collimated outflows ) that the wavelength variation from one side to the other of the nebula is @xmath153   at the selected location",
    ".    data for ngc6778 were taken in service mode during the night of 2015 august 15 under director s discretionary time .",
    "a total integration time of 3 @xmath11 600 s was obtained , with small offsets to remove the sky background contribution .",
    "the osiris btf images were bias- and flat - field corrected in the usual way using iraf .",
    "sky emission was removed by producing an image containing only the sky emission from the series of dithered images .",
    "this sky image was then subtracted from the original images of the source , resulting in images cleaned from any background and sky emission . to save telescope time , owing to the large exposure times needed to obtain the desired s / n ratio in the o  ii lines , no attempt was made to subtract the negligible nebular continuum .",
    "additionally , we show [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 , h@xmath1 and [ n  ii ] @xmath06548 narrow - band images taken from @xcite ( see sect .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "all the images were registered to the [ o  iii ] image pixel scale ( 0.189 arcsec pix@xmath16 ) and astrometrized using the 2mass catalog and the script designed by @xcite .",
    "ngc6778 was observed with vimos @xcite , on the eso - vlt ut3 melipal on the night of 2007 september 14 .",
    "vimos is equipped with an integral field unit containing 6400 fibers and has a changeable scale on the sky that was set to 0.33 arcsec per fiber .",
    "this provided a sky coverage of 13.2@xmath1113.2 arcsec@xmath13 with an image formed by an array of 40@xmath1140 fibers .",
    "we obtained observations in the vimos high - resolution mode , providing a reciprocal dispersion of 0.6   pix@xmath16 and a usable range from 3900 to 7400   adding the blue and red grisms of the spectrograph .",
    "the object was observed with an exposure time of 300 s in both the red and blue configurations .",
    "the reduction was performed with the vimos pipelines available at the instrument website . for sky subtraction",
    "we observed fields offset by 40 arcsec .",
    "the sky level was estimated as an average for each pixel along the dispersion axis and then subtracted from the object data cube .",
    "we also applied a correction for the differential atmospheric extinction using the central star of ngc6778 in the data cube and performing the necessary shifts along the dispersion axis . to extract the final vimos emission line maps we used a set of idl routines which fit gaussian profiles to the lines of interest in each spaxel in the data cube . in fig .",

    "it is known that in several pne the o  ii orls are contaminated by fluorescent n  iii lines and/or c  iii orls . in their deep vlt - fors2 spectrum of ngc6778 , @xcite did not report any contamination in the wavelength range covered by our tunable filter . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show a section of the observed spectrum of ngc6778 around the multiplet 1 of o  ii .",
    "it is clear that there is no emission from the c  iii @xmath04647.42 line , which is the brightest one of the multiplet 1 of c  iii .",
    "therefore , all the emission covered by the tunable filter comes purely from o  ii recombination lines .    from inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is clear that the [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 and h@xmath1 emissions share a very similar spatial distribution in the central parts of ngc6778 ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the [ n  ii ] @xmath06548 emission has a very different spatial distribution .",
    "@xcite showed that the innermost region of ngc6778 can be described as a distorted and fragmented [ n  ii]-bright equatorial ring aligned along a line close to the east - west direction .",
    "this [ n  ii ] cel innermost region is characterized by the presence of filamentary low - ionization structures ( lis ) .",
    "their origin , however , remains unknown but has been linked to post - ce nebulae through photoionization of neutral material deposited in the orbital plane during the ce phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the most important finding from inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is that in ngc6778 the location of the o@xmath18 ions producing the o  ii orls at 4649 + 50   does not match the spatial distribution of the same ions emitting in the [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 cel .",
    "the o  ii orl emission is concentrated inside the [ o  iii ] cel emission or hi emission .",
    "this is the first time that the different distribution of o  ii orl and nebular [ o  iii ] cel emission has been shown using direct imaging .",
    "this finding clearly supports the hypothesis of the existence of two separate plasmas , with the additional indication that they are not well mixed , perhaps because they were produced in distinct ejection events .",
    "previous works based on long - slit and 2d spectrophotometry in partial regions of pne found similar results .",
    "hence , this behaviour seems to be a standard characteristic of the orl emission in pne with high _ adf_s ( see e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have analyzed the morphology of the emission coming from various other lines on monochromatic emission line maps taken with vimos - vlt . in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the c  ii @xmath04267 and o  ii @xmath174649 + 50 maps which characterize the spatial distribution of pure c@xmath18 and o@xmath18 recombination emission . although the c  ii emission has a rather low contrast relative to the background , its global morphology resembles the o  ii @xmath174649 + 50 emission , showing local peaks at very similar spaxels . the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the resemblance of the auroral [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 cel and the nebular [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 cel emission maps .",
    "the morphologies of o  ii @xmath04649 + 50 and [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 emissions are remarkably different , and are consistent with what is found from the gtc and not imagery ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that the [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 and [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 cel emissions have a very different spatial distribution , but [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 resembles the o  ii orl emission .",
    "this causes a radially increasing [ o  iii]5007/4363 flux ratio , which may be interpreted as being due to a markedly negative electron temperature gradient ( * ? ? ?",
    "* estimated a negative gradient of more than 1000 k , see their fig .",
    "this effect has been found in other pne ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the pne ngc6153 and ngc6720 , respectively ) .",
    "however , the presence of extremely high - density clumps ( @xmath19@xmath2010@xmath21 @xmath22 ) in the inner regions would cause the quenching of nebular [ o  iii ] lines in the central part of the pn owing to collisional de - excitation effects .",
    "the effect of high - density ionized gas in the determination of chemical abundances from orls and cels has been studied in detail in i.  e. the orion nebula , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this would affect the determination of physical conditions ( @xmath19 and @xmath23 ) and abundances from cels , creating a spurious temperature gradient .",
    "moreover , if these clumps are h - poor and only contribute a few percent of the total h mass of the pn , as it has been proposed for pn , they would not be seen in hi images .",
    "therefore , our observations support the presence of a metal rich , dense component in the inner regions of ngc 6778 , where orl emission mainly form , in addition to the `` standard '' , low density and h - rich gas component where cels are emitted .",
    "other than its location in the inner nebular regions , which may indicate a younger origin , the morphology of the orl emitting gas does not provide any other clues to its origin .",
    "detailed 3d photoionization models are therefore needed to fully constrain the nebula and shed further light on its formation .",
    "all these results are in very good agreement with what was found by @xcite , although they were limited to a 1-d portion of the nebulae as selected in their long - slit fors2 observations .",

    "the maps area is 13.2@xmath1113.2 arcsec@xmath13 and the orientation is north up and east left .",
    "position of the central star is marked with a white cross . ]    finally , some kinematical studies point to the presence of a colder plasma where orls are preferentially emitted .",
    "from very high spectral resolution observations ( r=150,000 ) of two moderate to high _ adf _ pne ( ngc7009 with _ adf_@xmath25 and ngc6153 with _",
    "adf_@xmath210 ) @xcite found that the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of o  ii orls were significantly smaller than that shown by [ o  iii ] cels .",
    "they also found that auroral and nebular [ o  iii ] lines in ngc6153 showed different velocity profiles , which implies large temperature fluctuations .",
    "such large temperature fluctuations can also contribute to the observed _ adf _ ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite made a detailed kinematical study of orls and cels in a limited region of pn ngc7009 .",
    "they found that orls exhibit different kinematics to cels but no clear conclusion could be drawn because of the limited spatial coverage .",
    "@xcite analyzed high resolution ( r@xmath233,000 ) spectra of the halo pn bobn  1 .",
    "they found a relatively low _ adf _",
    "( @xmath22.5 ) and o  ii and ne  ii orls expansion velocities lower than that of [ o  iii ] and [ ne  iii ] cels , which they attributed to different thermal motions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the case of ngc6778 , where the o  ii orl emission comes from the innermost zones of the pn , the kinematics can be affected by the expansion velocity field combined with the ionization stratification of the gas in the pn .",
    "this would result in narrower o  ii orls compared to nebular [ o  iii ] cels .",
    "we present direct imaging in the light of the o  ii @xmath174649 + 50 orls for the first time in a pn . we have found that the distribution of the o@xmath18 emission coming from these lines in ngc6778 is more centrally concentrated than the emission coming from either the strongest [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 cel or the h@xmath1 rl . also , from 2d reconstructed vimos monochromatic emission line maps , we find that the auroral [ o  iii ] @xmath04363 cel emission resembles the o  ii orls emission but not the nebular [ o  iii ] emission . this may be due to presence of a high - density , h - poor gas component in the inner regions of the nebula , which could be responsible for the bulk of the o  ii emission and cause the abundance discrepancy .",
    "however , we do not have enough information to generalize the scenario of metal - rich inclusions to explain the bulk of low - to - moderate adf pne or h  ii regions .",
    "moreover , the effect of high - velocity flows , such as in hh objects , and/or high - density inclusions , such as proplyds , has definitely something to say in the abundance discrepancy problem in h  ii regions .",
    "the physical origin of the enhancement of the o  ii emission in the central parts of this pn is still elusive , but should almost certainly be linked to the binary evolution of its central star .",
    "additional observations are needed to put this important result on solid ground and further progress in our understanding of the origin of the phenomenon .",
    "determining the spatial distribution of the orls and cels , and confronting their dynamics in several pne with high _ adf _ values would help constrain the geometry and ejection mechanism of the metal rich ( h - poor ) component .",
