    "spin - orbit coupling gives rise to several interesting transport phenomena arising from the induced correlation between charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , it allows one to manipulate spins without using magnetic electrodes , having as such become one of the most studied topics within the field of spintronics .",
    "@xcite among the many interesting effects that arise from spin - orbit coupling , two stand out for their potential technological importance : the spin hall effect@xcite and the edelstein effect@xcite .",
    "the spin hall effect consists in the appearance of a @xmath0-polarized spin current flowing in the @xmath1-direction produced by an electric field in the @xmath2-direction.@xcite the generation of a perpendicular electric field by an injected spin current , i.e. the inverse spin hall effect , has been observed in numerous settings and presently provides the basis for one of the most effective methods to detect spin currents.@xcite the edelstein effect@xcite consists instead in the appearance of a @xmath1-spin polarization in response to an applied electric field in the @xmath2-direction . it has been proposed as a promising way of achieving all - electrical control of magnetic properties in electronic circuits.@xcite the two effects are deeply connected,@xcite as we will see momentarily .",
    "there are , in principle , several possible mechanisms for the spin hall effect , and it is useful to divide them in two classes .",
    "we call them either extrinsic or intrinsic , depending on whether their origin is the spin - orbit interaction with impurities or with the regular lattice structure . in this work",
    "we will focus exclusively on intrinsic effects .",
    "this means that the impurities ( while , of course , needed to give the system a finite electrical conductivity ) do not couple to the electron spin .",
    "bychkov and rashba devised an extremely simple and yet powerful model@xcite describing the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling of the electrons in a 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a quantum well in the presence of an electric field perpendicular to the plane in which the electrons move . in spite of its apparent simplicity",
    ", this analytically solvable model has several subtle features , which arise from the interplay of spin - orbit coupling and impurity scattering .",
    "the best - known feature is the vanishing of the spin hall conductivity ( shc ) for a uniform and constant in - plane electric field.@xcite this would leave spin - orbit coupling with impurities ( not included in the original bychkov - rashba model ) as the only plausible mechanism for the experimentally observed spin hall effect in semiconductor - based 2degs  @xcite .",
    "however it has been recently pointed out that the vanishing of the shc need not occur in systems which are not strictly two - dimensional , as explicitly shown in a model schematically describing the interface of the two insulating oxides laalo@xmath3 and srtio@xmath3 ( lao / sto)@xcite .",
    "even more recently  @xcite , it has been suggested that a large shc could be realized in a thin metal ( cu ) film that is sandwiched between two different insulators , such as oxides or the vacuum .",
    "such a system is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .     and",
    "@xmath4 are the heights of the two interfacial potential barriers .",
    "these potentials generate interfacial spin - orbit interactions of the rashba type , whose strength is controlled by the effective compton wavelengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively.,width=288 ]    the inversion symmetry breaking across the interfaces produces interfacial rashba - like spin - orbit couplings , thus allowing metals without substantial intrinsic bulk spin - orbit to host a non - vanishing shc . the spin - orbit coupling asymmetry  or , more generally , the fact that the spin - orbit interaction is not homogeneous across the thickness of the film  is the core issue in this novel approach . in this paper",
    "we will study the influence of the interfacial spin - orbit couplings on the edelstein and spin hall effects in this class of heterostructures .    before proceeding to a detailed study of the model depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , it is useful to recall the deep connection@xcite that exists between the spin hall and edelstein effects in the bychkov - rashba model , described by the hamiltonian [ rashba ] h=+(_xp_y-_yp_x ) , where @xmath7 is the effective electron mass and @xmath8 is the bychkov - rashba spin - orbit coupling constant given by @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the materials effective compton wavelength , @xmath11 the electric field perpendicular to the electron layer , and @xmath12 the absolute value of the electron charge .",
    "it is convenient to describe spin - orbit coupling in terms of a non - abelian gauge field @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite if not otherwise specified , superscripts indicate spin components , while subscripts stand for spatial components .",
    "the first consequence of resorting to this language is the appearance of an @xmath16 magnetic field @xmath17 , which arises from the non - commuting components of the bychkov - rashba vector potential .",
    "such a spin - magnetic field couples the charge current driven by an electric field , say along @xmath2 , to the @xmath0-polarized spin current flowing along @xmath1 .",
    "this is very much similar to the standard hall effect , where two _ charge _ currents flowing perpendicular to each other are coupled by a magnetic field .",
    "the drift component of the spin current can thus be described by a hall - like term [ shdrift ] [ j^z_y]_drift=^she_drift e_x .",
    "it is however important to appreciate that this is not yet the full spin hall current , i.e. @xmath18 is not the full shc . in the diffusive regime @xmath18",
    "is given by the classic formula @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the `` cyclotron frequency '' associated with the @xmath16 magnetic field , @xmath21 is the elastic momentum scattering time , and @xmath22 is the drude conductivity . for a more general formula see eq .",
    "( [ discussion_5 ] ) below .",
    "in addition to the drift current , there is also a `` diffusion current '' due to spin precession around the bychkov - rashba effective spin - orbit field . within the @xmath16 formalism",
    "this current arises from the replacement of the ordinary derivative with the @xmath16 covariant derivative in the expression for the diffusion current .",
    "the @xmath16 covariant derivative , due to the gauge field , is _",
    "j o = _ j o + i , with @xmath23 a given quantity being acted upon .",
    "the normal derivative , @xmath24 , along a given axis @xmath25 is shifted by the commutator with the gauge field component along that same axis . as a result of the replacement @xmath26 diffusion - like terms , normally proportional to spin density gradients ,",
    "arise even in uniform conditions and the diffusion contribution to the spin current turns out to be [ diffusion ] [ j^z_y]_diff= d s^y , where @xmath27 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath28 being the fermi velocity . in the diffusive regime",
    "the full spin current @xmath29 can thus be expressed as @xmath30 for a detailed justification of eq .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .  .",
    "the factor in front of the spin density in the first term of eq.([discussion_1 ] ) can also be written as an effective velocity @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the typical spin length due to the different fermi momenta in the two spin - orbit split bands , whereas @xmath33 is the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation time . in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath34",
    "one has @xmath35 which is indeed equivalent to the classical surmise given after eq .",
    "( [ shdrift ] ) .",
    "if we introduce the total shc and the edelstein conductivity ( ec ) defined by @xmath36 we may rewrite eq.([discussion_1 ] ) as @xmath37 in the standard bychkov - rashba model a general constraint from the equation of motion dictates that under steady and uniform conditions @xmath38",
    ". therefore the ec reads @xmath39 which is easily obtained by using the expressions given above and the single particle density of states in two dimensions , @xmath40 .",
    "the remarkable thing is that this expression remains unchanged for arbitrary ratios between the spin splitting energy and the disorder broadening of the levels .",
    "however , in a more general situation with a non - zero shc the ec would consist of the two terms appearing in eq .  .",
    "the latter equation is the `` deep connection '' mentioned earlier between the edelstein and the spin hall effect . the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "is the  regular \" contribution to the ec , the only surviving one in the bychkov - rashba model where the full shc vanishes .",
    "the second term is `` anomalous '' in the sense that it does not appear in the standard bychkov - rashba model , but it does appear in more general models such as the one we discuss in this paper . notice that the  regular \" term is proportional to @xmath21 ( see eq .",
    "( [ discussion_5 ] ) ) , while the  anomalous \" term , being proportional to the dyakonov - perel relaxation time @xmath34 and , in the diffusive regime , is _ inversely _ proportional to the momentum relaxation time .    at variance with the bychkov - rashba model , the one we choose for our system is not strictly two - dimensional , and we take into account several states of quantized motion in the direction perpendicular to the interface ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "another crucial feature of this model is the occurrence of two different spin - orbit couplings at the two interfaces .",
    "the difference arises because ( i ) the interfacial potential barriers @xmath41 and @xmath4 are generally different , and ( ii ) the effective compton wavelengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 , characterizing the spin - orbit coupling strength at the two interfaces , are different .",
    "our central results for the generic asymmetric model are @xmath42 and [ e9-preview ] ^ee=_n=1^n_c , the sums running over the @xmath43 filled @xmath0-subbands of the thin film .",
    "to each subband there correspond a fermi wavevector ( without spin - orbit ) @xmath44 , an intraband spin - orbit energy splitting with a linear- and a cubic - in-@xmath45 part [ deltae ] e_nk_fn & = & ( 2 e_0 n^2/d ) [ k_fn(_+^2-_-^2 ) + ( _ + ^6v_+-_-^6v_- ) ] + [ intra_split ] & & e^(1)_nk_fn + e^(3)_nk_fn and a dyakonov - perel spin relaxation time [ a ] = 2 . in the above formulas @xmath46 is the film thickness and @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath50 ( due to ehrenfest s theorem is shown by perturbation theory to be proportional to the expectation value of @xmath51 , i.e. the force , in the ground - state in the absence of spin - orbit coupling . by ehrenfest s theorem",

    "= -_n=1^n_c . at the same time",
    "the `` anomalous '' ec is at its largest .",
    "a second very interesting configuration is a strongly asymmetric insulator - metal - vacuum junction , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this case",
    "the shc becomes directly proportional to the gap @xmath55 ^she = -_n=1^n_c2mk^2_fnv^4 .",

    "let us first assume a `` quasi - symmetric '' configuration , i.e. though @xmath48 , the barrier heights are different , @xmath171 .",
    "we then obtain that the spin splitting of the bands vanishes to linear order in @xmath45 ( @xmath172 ) ( see footnote 48 ) so that @xmath173 and [ v3 ] ^ee=_n^n_cen_0 .the shc in this limit is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "this very striking result is reminiscent of the universal result @xmath174 obtained for a single bychkov - rashba band when vertex corrections are ignored .",
    "@xcite however vertex corrections are now fully included , yet the shc is not only finite , but _",
    "independent _ of @xmath10 and equal to the single band universal result multiplied by a factor @xmath175 !",
    "we emphasize that this result has nothing to do with the non - vanishing intrinsic shc that arises in certain generalized models of spin - orbit coupling with winding number higher than 1 .",
    "@xcite rather , it has everything to do with the @xmath45-dependence of the transverse subbands describing the electron wave function in the @xmath0- direction .",
    "we also find that the anomalous part of the edelstein effect becomes large , as it is proportional to @xmath176 , and the splitting vanishes with the third power of @xmath45 at small @xmath45 .",
    "let us finally discuss the fully inversion - symmetric limit of the model , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we notice that in this case the limit of eq .   does not exist , because both @xmath93 and @xmath94 vanish ( the spin splitting is identically zero ! ) while the value of eq",
    ".   depends on the order in which @xmath93 and @xmath94 tend to zero , in particular on whether they tend to zero simultaneously , or @xmath93 tend to zero before @xmath94 , as in the `` quasi - symmetric '' case above .",
    "the origin of this apparently unphysical non - analytic behavior can be traced back to the singular character of the vertex for vanishing spin splitting . under these circumstances ,",
    "the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation time diverges , apparently implying spin conservation .",
    "however , even in the inversion - symmetric limit , interband effects provide spin relaxation processes which regularize the vertex .",
    "such effects are typically negligible away from the inversion - symmetric limit , since they are proportional to the square of the wave - function overlap between different bands and therefore scale as @xmath179 . however , in the inversion - symmetric limit they can not be neglected .",
    "a full analysis of interband effects is beyond the scope of the present paper , and we limit ourselves to a heuristic discussion of the physical origin of the spin relaxation mechanism due to interband virtual transitions . in the inversion - symmetric",
    "limit , the hamiltonian is invariant upon the simultaneous operations of space inversion along the @xmath0-direction ( @xmath180 ) and helicity flipping ( @xmath181 ) , i.e. , a full mirror reflection in the @xmath64 plane .",
    "hence the eigenfunctions can be classified as even or odd under such a reflection : [ symmetry ] f_ns(z)=p_n f_n - s ( -z ) . where @xmath182 .",
    "furthermore the parity eigenvalue @xmath183 is the same as in the absence of spin - orbit interaction , because the reflection commutes with the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "since states of opposite helicity are degenerate , one can construct , in each band @xmath113 , states that are linear combinations of the helicity eigenstates @xmath184 _ n&= & ( f_n+(z)|++ f_n-(z)|- ) + _ n&= & ( f_n+(z)|+- f_n-(z)|- ) .",
    "these can be rewritten in terms of the eigenstates @xmath185 and @xmath186 of @xmath187 and , after using ( [ symmetry ] ) , one obtains _",
    "n&=&|+ie^i _ | + _ n&=&|+ie^i _ | .",
    "one sees immediately that , within the first born approximation , impurity scattering can not produce spin flipping within a band because the matrix element of the @xmath0-independent disorder potential between @xmath188 @xmath189 vanishes by symmetry .    on the other hand",
    ", spin flipping may occur in the second born approximation by going through an intermediate state in a band of opposite parity .",
    "for example , an electron may first jump , under the action of the disorder potential , to a state of _ opposite _ spin in an unoccupied band of opposite parity ; then in a second step it may return to the original band without flipping its spin . alternatively",
    "the spin may remain unchanged in the transition to the unoccupied band , and flip on the way back to the original band . as a result of such second - order processes , a new mechanism of spin relaxation arises , which we call _ inter - band spin relaxation _",
    ", with rate @xmath190 . when this additional relaxation mechanism is taken into account , the diverging dp relaxation time in eq .",
    "( [ vc19 ] ) for the vertex is replaced by the finite total spin relaxation time @xmath191 .",
    "thus , the non - analyticity is cured .",
    "the regime analyzed in this paper corresponds to the situation in which @xmath192 , and inter - band spin relaxation can be neglected .",
    "clearly , when looking at the fully symmetric limit , with vanishing spin splitting , inter - band relaxation must be taken into account , together with inter - band contributions to the shc and ec .",
    "once more , a full - fledged treatment of this regime is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we have developed a simple model for describing spin transport effects and spin - charge conversion in heterostructures consisting of a metallic film sandwiched between two different insulators .",
    "all the effects we have considered depend crucially on the three - dimensional nature of the system  in particular , the fact that the transverse wave functions depend on the in - plane momentum  and on the lack of inversion symmetry caused by the different properties of the top and bottom metal - insulator interfaces , each characterized by a different barrier height ( gap ) and spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "after a careful consideration of vertex corrections we find that the model supports a non - zero intrinsic shc , in sharp contrast to the 2deg rashba case .",
    "strikingly , in a `` quasi - symmetric '' junction the shc reaches a maximal and universal value .",
    "we have also calculated the edelstein effect for the same model and found that the induced spin polarization is the sum of two different contributions .",
    "the first one is analogous to the term found in the 2deg rashba case , whereas the second `` anomalous '' one has a completely different nature .",
    "namely , it is inversely proportional to the scattering time , indicating that it is caused by the combined action of multiple electron - impurity scattering and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we have also discussed the general connection between the non - vanishing shc and the anomalous term in the ec .",
    "furthermore , by onsager s reciprocity relations , our results are immediately relevant to the inverse edelstein effect@xcite , in which a non - equilibrium spin density induces a charge current . the above features , although discussed here for a specific model , are expected to be general , proper to any non - strictly two - dimensional system in which the spin - orbit interaction is non - homogeneous across the confining direction .",
    "technical applications of this idea could lead to a new class of spin - orbit - coupling - based devices .",
