    "if it is possible to distinguish between the two particles , then there is some measurement  ( for example , of mass or charge ) that we can , in principle , perform on each particle immediately before  @xmath0 and after  @xmath1 that allows us to conclude , for instance , that the particle responsible for outcome  @xmath2 is the same as that responsible for  @xmath4  ( see fig .",

    "_ left : _ if the particles are distinguishable , one can experimentally determine which transition actually occurs ",
    "the ` direct ' one  ( _ top _ ) , or the ` indirect ' one  ( _ bottom _ ) . _",
    "right : _ if the particles are indistinguishable , one can not say what happened in the intermediate time on the basis of the information experimentally obtained.,width=312 ]    if , however , the particles can not be distinguished from one another , we can not draw such a conclusion .",
    "even the conclusion that `` the particle that generated outcome  @xmath2 was also responsible for outcome  @xmath4 or @xmath5 , but we do not know which '' is invalid since we can not verify this statement on account of particle indistinguishability . to nonetheless draw such a conclusion would be tantamount to assuming the separate and continued existence of the particles between observations , which assumption our experience with quantum phenomena should warn us against . in particular , in the case of electron diffraction at a double - slit  @xcite , in the absence of which - way detectors at each slit , we can not infer from the experimental data that the electron passed through one slit or the other ; if we nonetheless insist on drawing this inference , our predictions are incorrect  we are unable to account for the observed diffraction pattern .",
    "as we have no way of ` looking inside ' the indistinguishable - particle process , we must treat it as a black box . as a result , we can not directly compute the amplitude ,  @xmath8 , of the indistinguishable - particle process . again , electron diffraction is analogous :  the transition amplitude of an electron from source to screen in the absence of which - way detectors can not be computed directly .",
    "instead , it is obtained  ( via feynman s amplitude sum rule ) from the sum of the amplitudes of the two possible transitions through the slits with the detectors present , which amplitudes _ can _ be calculated  @xcite . in the present case of two particles , then , we seek to relate the amplitude of the indistinguishable - particle transition ,  @xmath8 , with the amplitudes ,  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 , of the ` direct '  ( one particle moves from  @xmath2 to  @xmath4 , the other from  @xmath3 to  @xmath5 ) and ` indirect '  ( one particle moves from  @xmath2 to  @xmath5 , the other from  @xmath3 to  @xmath4 ) transitions of the two distinguishable particles , where each of these particles agree in all their dynamically - relevant properties with the indistinguishable particles .",
    "now , we can not relate  @xmath8 to  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 via the sum rule since the sum rule only applies when different experiments are applied to the _ same _ system , whereas  @xmath8 refers to indistinguishable particles , while  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 refer to distinguishable particles .",
    "so , in order to derive a connection between  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 and  @xmath10 , we must first assume that , as in the case of electron diffraction , such a relation exists .",
    "accordingly , we postulate that @xmath11 where  @xmath8 lies in the closed unit disc ,  @xmath12 , in the complex plane , and  @xmath13 is a continuous function , with some domain  @xmath14 , to be determined  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : two - particles - one - stage ] ) .",
    "similarly , when two particles are subject to three successive measurements , we postulate that the indistinguishable - particle amplitude ,  @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 where  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 are the amplitudes of the corresponding distinguishable - particle transitions  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : two - particles - two - stages ] ) , and  @xmath19 is a function , with some domain  @xmath20 , to be determined .",
    "both of these postulates are special cases of the operational indistinguishability postulate stated above .",

    "that is , the outcome probabilities observed in one subexperiment are indepen1dent of the outcome probabilities of the other subexperiment , or even of whether or not the other subexperiment is performed .    in this case of isolated subexperiments , we assume , as is conventional , that we can compute the transition probabilities of each subexperiment without regard for the other . we refer to this as the _ isolation condition_. in particular ,",
    "if the amplitude of the transition from  @xmath2 to  @xmath4 is  @xmath27 , then the transition probability is simply  @xmath21 . likewise , if the amplitude of the transition from  @xmath3 to  @xmath5 is  @xmath28 , then the transition probability is  @xmath22 .",
    "since the subexperiments are statistically independent , the overall transition probability  ( initial detection at  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , final detection at  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 ) is  @xmath29 .",

    "we have shown that there exists a direct path from the assumption that identical particles are indistinguishable to the symmetrization postulate .",
    "unlike the topological approach , the result applies to any quantum system , such as system of identical particles with spin , or a system of identical abstract finite dimensional subsystems , and relies on the standard quantum formalism rather than any variant thereof .",
    "the derivation is a natural extension and application of the ideas previously used to derive feynman s rules of quantum theory .",
    "this demonstrates that the symmetrization postulate is comparable in nature and reliability to the core quantum formalism , contrary to what has previously appeared to be the case . from the point of view of the derivation ,",
    "the symmetrization postulate admits no natural variants , and , _ contra _ the topological approach , is unrelated to the dimension of space .",
    "in particular , the derivation implies that identical particles do not generically exhibit anyonic behavior in two dimensions .",
    "as detailed elsewhere  @xcite , the methodology used to derive feynman s rules has been previously used to derive  @xcite the formalism of probability theory starting from boolean logic , and has recently been applied to yield important insights in other domains  @xcite .",
    "the successful application of this methodology to the symmetrization postulate leads us to anticipate that this methodology may provide a valuable tool in understanding and constructing physical theory .",

    "@xcite , the measurements and interactions which can be employed in a given experiment must be carefully circumscribed if they are to lead to a well - defined theoretical model .",
    "the overarching requirement is that , in the given experiment , the outcome probabilities of any measurement but the first are independent of any interactions with the system prior to the first measurement , a requirement we refer to as _ experimental closure_. intuitively , the first measurement ` screens off ' the prior history of the system , rendering this prior history irrelevant insofar as making predictions about the outcomes of subsequent measurements in the experiment is concerned .",
    "the requirement of experimental closure naturally leads to the following definitions and constraints .",
    "an experimental set - up is defined by specifying a source of physical systems , a sequence of measurements to be performed on a system on a run of the experiment , and the interactions with the system which occur between the measurements . in a run of an experiment ,",
    "a physical system from the source passes through a sequence of measurements  @xmath108 , which respectively yield outcomes  @xmath109 at times  @xmath110 .",

    "the measurements that yield these outcomes , the times at which these outcomes occur , and the nature of the system that is under examination , are all left implicit in the notation , and so must be inferred from the context . in between these measurements ,",
    "the system may undergo interactions with the environment .    over many runs of the experiment",
    ", the experimenter will observe the frequencies of the various possible measurement sequences , from which one can  ( using bayes rule ) estimate the probability associated with each sequence .",
    "we define the probability  @xmath112 associated with sequence  @xmath113}}$ ] as the probability of obtaining outcomes  @xmath114 conditional upon obtaining  @xmath115 , @xmath116    a particular outcome of a measurement is either _ atomic _ or _ coarse - grained_. an atomic outcome is one that can not be more finely divided in the sense that the detector whose output corresponds to the outcome can not be sub - divided into smaller detectors whose outputs correspond to two or more outcomes .",
    "an example of atomic outcomes are the two possible outcomes of a stern - gerlach measurement performed on a silver atom .",
    "a coarse - grained outcome is one that does not differentiate between two or more outcomes , an example being a stern - gerlach measurement where a detector s field of sensitivity encompasses the fields of sensitivity of two detectors each of which corresponds to a different atomic outcome .",
    "abstractly , if measurement  @xmath117 has an outcome which is a coarse - graining of the outcomes labeled  @xmath118 and  @xmath119 of measurement  @xmath120 , the outcome of  @xmath117 is labeled  @xmath121 , and this notational convention naturally extends to coarse - graining of more than two atomic outcomes . in general , if all of the possible outcomes of a measurement are atomic , we shall call the measurement itself atomic .",
    "otherwise , we say it is a coarse - grained measurement .",
    "it is important that all of the measurements that are employed in an experimental set - up come from the same _ measurement set _ ,  @xmath122 , or are coarsened versions of measurements in this set .",

    "namely that the outcome probabilities of the final measurement in both instances are independent of interactions with the system prior to the preparation .",

    "the operational framework sketched above is concerned with measurements that probe the entire system .",
