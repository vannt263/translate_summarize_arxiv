    "sakai et al . ( 2002 ) speculate that the enhanced star formation was triggered internally to the group itself , by tidal interaction among its galaxies , independently from the presence of a1367 .",

    "as part of the @xmath0 survey of a1367 ( iglesias - paramo et al . 2002 ) we obtained one hour integration of the cluster central region using the wide field camera ( wfc ) attached to the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) through a narrow band filter centered at @xmath10 6725   , covering the redshifted @xmath0 and [ nii ] lines .",
    "the underlying continuum was taken through the ( sloan - gunn ) @xmath11 broad band red filter with an exposure of 15 min . since the region of interest around ngc3860",
    "was partly hidden by the gap between two chips of the camera , in march 2002 we obtained one additional 2 hours @xmath0 exposure ( 20 min in the continuum ) with the 2.1 m telescope at san pedro martir ( mexico ) , with a similar experimental setup .",
    "all images were obtained in photometric conditions with a seeing of @xmath10 1.8  arcsec .",
    "the photometric calibration was obtained exposing the star feige 34 .",
    "the individual images were bias subtracted and flat - fielded using combinations of exposures of empty fields taken at twiglight and re - binned to a common pixel size .",
    "after background subtraction the intensity in the combined off - band frames was normalized to that of the combined on - band one using the flux ratio of several field stars .",
    "the combined net frame was obtained by subtraction of the off from the on frame .",
    "the resulting stacked frames , corresponding to 3 hours ( on - band ) and 35 min ( off - band ) of integration time are shown in figs .",

    "spectra of another 4 dwarf systems were obtained in april 2002 using the cafos spectrograph attached to the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto ( spain ) .",

    "( 2002 ) , it is the first time that such high density of star forming galaxies has been seen in a nearby cluster , in spite of having collected data over an area of a1367 , coma and the virgo cluster approximately 500 times larger than the one shown in fig.[color ] .",
    "+ the h@xmath1 dwarfs are found at the redshift of 8200@xmath27150 @xmath28 ( see table 1 ) , consistent with the redshift of two bright galaxies ( 97 - 114 and 97 - 125 ) that was known from previous optical / radio spectroscopy .",
    "this velocity exceeds significantly the mean cluster velocity of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) @xmath28 ( struble & rood 1991 ) .",
    "in addition to 12 galaxies in fig.[color ] , redshifts in excess of 7700 @xmath28 are found for another 8 galaxies in a1367 .",
    "they are all spatially segregated near the cluster center , and form a secondary peak in the cluster velocity distribution of fig .",
    "we consider unlikely that the group sits in the background of abell 1367 , in free hubble flow for two reasons .",
    "firstly , at 30 arcmin projected angular separation from the cluster center ( see fig .",
    "[ vel ] ) the group velocity of 8200 @xmath28 falls within the caustics associated with the density enhancement of a1367 ( see fig",
    ". 7 of gavazzi , randone & branchini 1995 ) . in other words",
    "the group is well within the turn - around radius of the cluster .",
    "this points out the existence of a separate dynamical unit falling into the cluster from the near side .",
    "the compact part of this group , comprising 12 central group members , will be referred to as the `` blue infalling group '' ( big ) hereafter .",
    "three objects are not associated with big ( see table 1 ) : cgcg97 - 113 is the only galaxy in the region with a velocity within the velocity dispersion of a1367 ; bo[121 ] lies in the background ; the third massive galaxy ngc 3860 ( marked 97 - 120 in fig .",

    "observations of the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) line ( chincarini et al . 1983 ) show that ngc 3860 has lost approximately 90 % of its original hydrogen content ( @xmath32=0.9 ) , indicating that the galaxy has crossed the cluster core , and that the ram - pressure ( gunn & gott 1972 ) exerted by the dense intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( with a central density @xmath33 = 1.25  10@xmath34 atoms  cm@xmath34 ) ( mohr et al .",
    "1999 ) has caused its hydrogen deficiency .",
    "+ conversely 97 - 125 , the brightest member of big , has a normal hydrogen content ( @xmath36 ( sakai et al . 2002 ) , implying @xmath32=-0.21 ) , pointing out that this galaxy has not yet crossed the dense cluster medium",
    ". however its hi column density distribution appears asymmetric , with the highest signal in the western side of the galaxy , as seen in hi map obtained by sakai et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( see their fig . 7 ) .",
    "although the asymmetry is interpreted by sakai et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as due to a tidal interaction among big members , it is also consistent with the hypothesis that the galaxy is entering the cluster igm and its hi content is being removed from the eastern side and accumulated in the western side , possibly due to ram - pressure , as found in other infalling galaxies discussed by gavazzi ( 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore the hi map of sakai et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reveals a marginal detection associated with gcgc97 - 114 , with a resulting hi deficiency of 0.7 .",
    "this high value suggests that this galaxy is currently undergoing gas erosion by ram - pressure , thus it has already encountered the cluster igm .",
    "we conclude that the big galaxies are plausibly at the front - edge of a1367 , beginning their journey through the cluster igm . +",
    "unfortunately the tully - fisher ( 1977 ) distance estimator is not accurate enough to confirm this 3-d picture . with this method",
    "we obtain a distance of 88 @xmath37 and 82 @xmath37 mpc for gcgc97 - 125 and gcgc97 - 114 respectively , consistent with the distance of 85 mpc of a1367 , but not sufficiently accurate to exclude that big is in hubble flow at 110 mpc .",
    "+ all star - forming galaxies in big have detectable continuum emission in the red - band image shown in fig .",
    "this demonstrates that they all contain a significant ( @xmath38 m@xmath39 , as estimated from their @xmath11 luminosity using the m / l conversion of gavazzi et al .",

    "@xmath42 -12.2 has a slope of only @xmath43 = -1 , shallower than @xmath44 = -1.20 found in the deepest cluster surveys ( trentham & tully 2002 ) .",
    "it is consistent with the @xmath11 band luminosity function of hickson compact groups ( hunsberger et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggesting that originally big was a normal compact group . on the opposite ,",
    "big represents a true exception as far as its young stars content .",
    "how this translates in the slope of the h@xmath1 luminosity function ?",
    "the existing h@xmath1 observations of compact groups ( iglesias - paramo & vilchez 1999 ; vilchez & iglesias - paramo 1998 ) are unfortunately 10 times shallower than the present ones , making their @xmath45 undetermined at the faint levels of the present survey .",
    "thus we derived the h@xmath1 luminosity function of big and compared it with the one of the cluster abell 1367 ( iglesias - paramo et al .",
    "the faint end of big has a slope @xmath45 = -1.25 , significantly steeper than @xmath45 = -0.8 found in the cluster .",
    "in other words the ratio of faint - to - bright galaxies is 5 times larger in this group than in the cluster .",
    "we have shown that the h@xmath1 glowing galaxies projected near the center of a1367 are relatively `` old '' galaxies that would have escaped attention when observed in broad - band images .",
    "similar overdensities of star forming objects have never been observed neither in nearby clusters nor in compact groups .",
    "what is the mechanism that triggers the burst of star formation , for the first time seen here , in an otherwise normal group falling into a rich cluster of galaxies ? is the perturbation locally excited , or induced by an external agent ?",
    "+      sakai et al . (",
    "2002 ) favour the internal interpretation .",
    "they argue that the burst of star formation is caused by tidal encounters between the group members .",
    "they proposed that the dwarf systems in big formed from enriched material stripped from one of the larger galaxies due to a recent tidal interaction .",
    "their argument is supported by three evidences : i ) the stellar - shells surrounding the galaxy 97 - 125 at approximately 30 , 45 and 60 arcsec from its center ( see fig . [ r ] ) , indicate that it has merged with another group galaxy , as shells around galaxies result either from minor ( thomson & wright 1990 ) or major ( schweizer 1980 ) merging events .",
    "the h@xmath1 filament observed within the stellar envelope of 97 - 125 might be the remnant of a recently swallowed galaxy .",
    "ii ) the metallicity of one of the faint knots ( k2 ) is similar to the one of 97 - 125 , i.e. approximately solar .",
    "this rules out the evolutionary scenario in which the intergalactic knots k2 are isolated normal dwarf galaxies evolving as closed systems , because such faint objects are expected to have metallicities in the range 1/20 - 1/40 solar .",
    "iii ) the presence of an hi bridge extending through many of the emission - line regions , argues in favour of the tidal interpretation .",
    "+ there are arguments against this interpretation : i ) although there is clear evidence of merging in cgcg97 - 125 ( shells ) , we argue that the overall morphology of big does not fully support the tidal interaction picture because no evidence of large - scale tidal tails is found here , providing the clear signature of a merging event ( see the antennae in hibbard et al .",
    "2001 and the simulations of barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "ii ) should the abnormal star formation in big be triggered by tidal interactions among its galaxies , similar phenomena would be frequently observed in other compact groups , contrary to the observations of vilchez & iglesias - paramo ( 1998 ) . among big dwarfs , only dw1 , dw2 and dw3",
    "have broad - band colors ( b - r ) available from sakai et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( 0.05 , 0.53 and 0.2 respectively ) .",
    "these colors are marginally bluer than the average @xmath46 found among 143 tidal dwarf candidates in 10 interacting systems studied by weilbacher et al .",
    "this blue excess confirms the exceptional nature of big among other compact groups even those containing tidal interacting systems .",
    "iii ) while the faint knots ( k2 ) show a high metallicity , similar to the one of 97 - 125 , the metal abundances of the two other dwarf systems dw1 and dw3 ( sakai et al . 2002 ) are consistent with their being irregular galaxies evolved independently .",
    "+      we offer an alternative interpretation emphasizing that big is likely infalling onto a1367 at high speed .",
    "+ galaxy infall occours elsewhere onto this cluster .",
    "gavazzi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found evidence for enhanced current star formation activity associated with faint ( @xmath47 ) galaxies , consistent with these being objects recently `` captured '' by the cluster .",
    "similarly bravo - alfaro et al . ( 2000 , 2001 ) found that several spiral galaxies in the coma cluster have their neutral hydrogen content significantly displaced from their optical centroids , consistent with their recent arrival into the cluster hostile environment . among galaxies in a1367 ,",
    "cgcg97 - 073 and cgcg97 - 079 were studied in some detail by gavazzi et al .",
    "( 1995 ; 2001 ) who found that both galaxies have their present star formation enhanced along peripheral hii regions which developped at the side facing the direction of motion through the dense cluster igm . there are indications that their neutral hydrogen is displaced in the opposite side ( dickey & gavazzi 1991 ) .",
    "trails of 50 kpc length are detected both in the light of the synchrotron radiation ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1995 ) and in h@xmath1 ( gavazzi et al .",

    "+ the galaxies in big have low stellar surface densities ( @xmath50 @xmath10 5 10@xmath34 g  @xmath51 ) and interstellar gas surface densities ( @xmath52 @xmath10 @xmath53 g  @xmath51 ) typical of dwarfs galaxies .",
    "thus the restoring gravitational force ( pressure ) at their interior : @xmath54\\ ] ] results significantly smaller than the ram - pressure . in conclusion",
    "the external pressure is sufficient to compress and shock their interstellar gas , thereby triggering a star formation burst , as suggested by fujita & nagashima ( 1999 ) . in the long run",
    "the increasing ram - pressure will fully strip their gaseous material leading to the complete ablation of their interstellar gas , thus suppressing the star formation due to fuel exhaustion .",

    "<S> redshift measurements suggest that the group galaxies are in the process of falling into the cluster at very high speed . </S>",
    "<S> we explore two possible mechanisms that could have triggered the short - lived stellar burst we are witnessing : the first , internal to the group itself , via tidal interactions among its members , the hypothesis favoured by sakai et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) ; the second associated with the high velocity infall of the group galaxies into the cluster intergalactic medium . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidences in favour and against the two hypotheses . </S>"
