    "the omcat was constructed from a complete reprocessing of the om data using the standard _",
    "omichain_/_omfchain _ pipelines in sas 6.5.0 . for each observation ( obsid )",
    "the reprocessing created a source list ; the omcat is a concatenation of these source lists .",
    "thus , if the same region of sky was observed by multiple obsids , then some sources will be listed multiple times .",
    "each listing should have the same coordinates ( to the limit of the astrometric accuracy ) and thus it should be reasonably obvious which listings refer to the same source .",
    "we have opted to retain multiple listings ( rather than to combine them into a `` mean '' entry ) to retain any useful information of temporal variability in an easily accessible manner .",
    "an overview of the catalogue statistics is given in table  [ tab : over ] .    in this paper",
    " 2 provides a brief description of the om and its primary observation modes ,  3 describes the standard pipeline processing , the further processing done to produce the source lists , and the output products that are unique to our processing . ",
    "4 contains some useful statistics describing the catalogue . in  5 we demonstrate the extent to which the om filter set allows photometric classification of point - like sources , and in  6 we explore some of the scientific uses of the om - specific bands .",
    "* the telescope and detector : * the om @xcite is a 30 cm f/12.7 ritchey chretien telescope coaligned with the x - ray telescopes and operating simultaneously with them . the detector is a micro - channel plate intensified charge - coupled device ( ccd ) .",
    "photons striking a photocathode produce electrons that are amplified by two successive micro - channel plates .",
    "the electron clouds then strike a phosphor , and the resulting photon splashes are recorded by a ccd ; the location of the photon splash is centroided on board .",
    "the centroids are stored in units of 1/8 of a ccd pixel .",
    "since it is these photon splashes that are recorded by the ccd , rather than individual photons , the ccd is read out very rapidly ( every 11@xmath2s ) , and the centroids of the photon splashes determined and stored .",
    "thus , the ccd is used more like a photon - counting device than an accumulator , although it is an image , rather than an event list , that is produced .",
    "the photocathode is optimized for the blue and ultraviolet .",
    "the `` native '' pixel size is @xmath3 and the point spread function ( psf ) fwhm is @xmath4-@xmath5 depending upon filter .",
    "the largest possible field of view ( fov ) is roughly @xmath6 .",

    "galex_(a 1.2@xmath7 circle ) but better angular resolution ( _ galex _  has a @xmath8 fwhm psf in its fuv filter ( 1350 - 1750  , and a @xmath9 fwhm psf in its nuv filter ( 1750 - 2800  ) * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the effective areas of the om and _ galex _  filters are shown in figure  [ fig : filts ] while the om filter particulars are given in table  [ tab : filters ] .",
    "thus , the omcat data in the uvw2 and uvm2 filters provide an excellent higher resolution complement to the _ galex _  nuv data , while uvw1 data is somewhat redder than the _ galex _  band .",
    "the _ swift _ uvot is , essentially , an improved om , with similar filters , so comparison of data in this catalogue with uvot data should be straightforward .    * the observation modes : * due to the onboard centroiding , memory limitations , and telemetry limitations , setting the om observation mode has to be a balance of temporal resolution and spatial coverage ; the higher the temporal resolution the lower the spatial coverage . as a result",
    ", the om allows a large number of observing modes that place different emphases on temporal and spatial optimization .",
    "these modes define different `` science windows '' covering only portions of the entire fov ; events falling outside of those windows are discarded .",
    "there are two primary observation modes at the extremes : the default `` imaging '' mode and the default `` fast '' mode .",
    "the default imaging mode consists of five consecutive sub - exposures , each of which employs two science windows ; one high - resolution window and one low - resolution window .",
    "note that resolution , in this case , refers to the degree to which the image is sampled , not to an intrinsic change in the psf size .",
    "the fov of the default imaging mode is shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fov ] . the high - resolution window ( roughly @xmath10 ,",
    "marked `` hr '' in the figure ) is always located at the center of the fov .",
    "the five low - resolution windows ( marked `` sw '' in the figure ) cumulatively cover the entire fov ( roughly @xmath6 ) with a center square surrounded by five rectangular regions . for any number of reasons ,",
    "not all of the sub - exposures of a default image may actually be taken , but , for the default imaging mode , there will always be a high - resolution sub - exposure for each low - resolution sub - exposure .",
    "it should be noted that multiple observing modes may be used during the course of a single observation , so not all exposures of a single observation need cover the same region .",
    "the use of five different science windows to cover the fov , with some overlap between the windows , means that the exposure is not uniform across the fov .",
    "there are two other common full - field low - resolution modes , `` eng-2 '' and `` eng-4 '' , which are also included in our processing .",
    "the fov for these modes are shown in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fov ] ; the two modes cover the same area but with different binning , the `` eng-2 '' mode having twice the pixel size as the `` eng-4 '' mode .",
    "there is no repeated high - resolution window for these modes .",
    "the default fast mode uses the same windows as the default imaging mode with the addition of a third science window ( roughly @xmath11 ) at an observer - defined location ( typically the center of the fov ) .",
    "* the default modes : * if the observer did not specify an om mode , and there was no bright source in the fov , the om took exposures in the default imaging mode . for the first two years of the mission the default filters were b , uvw2 , u , and uvw1 , in order of priority .",
    "the filter priority was then changed to uvm2 , uvw1 , and u , in order to optimize the use of the unique capabilities of the om .    *",
    "magnitude system : * the standard om processing produces _ instrumental _ magnitudes .",
    "we have opted to continue to work in the instrumental magnitude system .",
    "the definition of the instrumental magnitudes and the current conversion to ab magnitudes is given in the _ xmm - newton _   user s handbook in rough terms , the v and b the instrumental magnitudes are similar to ab magnitudes , but the uv the instrumental magnitudes are typically smaller than the ab magnitudes by a magnitude to a magnitude and a half .",
    "* image mode processing : * for the most part , we have used the standard _",
    "omichain _ processing with the default settings ; exceptions are detailed below .",
    "the standard _",
    "omichain _ processing ( processing for images ) handles the images produced by each science window separately . for each science window image",
    "_ omichain _ applies a flatfield .",
    "the photon splash centroiding algorithm calculates the centroid to 1/8 of a pixel , but due to the algorithm , not all values are equally likely .",
    "this problem results in `` modulo-8 '' fixed pattern noise .",
    "the _ omichain _",
    "processing applies a redistribution to correct for this effect .    for every science window image _ omichain _ runs a source detection algorithm , measures the count rates for the sources , and applies a calibration to convert to instrumental magnitudes .",
    "once all of the science windows are processed , _",
    "omichain _ produces a `` master '' source list by combining the source list for each science window , matching sources in common between the lists , and determining the mean @xmath12 for each source .",
    "the standard processing has the option to use an external catalogue to correct the coordinates of the master source list ; we have used this option with the usno - b1 catalogue @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the coordinate correction using the usno - b1 catalogue will fail if there are too few matching sources , in which case no significant solution can be found .",
    "the _ omichain _",
    "algorithm requires at least ten matches in order to produce a significant coordinate correction .",
    "if there are too many sources in the field , coordinate correction will also fail , presumably because some fraction of matches are spurious and the solution will not converge .",
    "we have found that the coordinate correction _ can _ fail for almost any density of sources , though we did not determine the cause of that failure .",
    "in addition to combining the source lists for all the filters , _",
    "omichain _ mosaics the low - resolution science window images ( but not the high - resolution science window images ) for each filter .",
    "the world coordinate system ( wcs ) of the first science window for a given filter sets the coordinate system of the entire image mosaic .",
    "note that the standard _",
    "omichain _ processing can correct the master source list , but not the images .",
    "further , the correction using an external catalogue will be applied only if there are at least ten sources .",
    "one does have the option of doing the same correction to the individual science windows , but there are often not enough sources in a single science window to perform such a correction .",
    "we have applied the correction derived from the external catalogue to the low - resolution mosaics .",
    "since the mosaic images use the wcs from the first science window in the mosaic , we compared the @xmath12 in the source list for the first science window to the @xmath12 in the usno corrected master list .",
    "we then determined the @xmath13 which must be added to the @xmath12 of the first source list in order to obtain the @xmath12 in the usno corrected master list .",
    "we then applied that correction to the header keywords of the mosaicked image .",
    "it must be noted that since the telescope can drift by 1 - 2 arcseconds between exposures , this correction is done separately for each filter .",
    "the standard _",
    "omichain _ processing does not combine the images from the high - resolution science windows .",
    "however , we have done so , though not with _",
    "ommosaic _ , the standard sas tool .",
    "the _ ommosaic _",
    "program uses the wcs keywords to determine the offsets needed to align the wcs frames of the individual science windows before summing .",
    "we allow the wcs of the summed image to be set by the first science window . for each successive high resolution image",
    ", we compare the source list to the source list from the first image , determine the @xmath13 required to match the source lists , and apply that offset to the image before adding it to the mosaic .",
    "not all sources are used for determining the offsets , only sources appearing in at least half of the images ; this selection removes sources with poorly determined positions .",
    "the offsets are rounded to the nearest integer pixel ; subpixelization did not seem to produce a significant improvement in the resultant psf , and so was not used for this processing . compared to the direct sum of the images made by _",
    ", our processing does improve the psf of the summed image , sometimes improving the fwhm by as much as a pixel ( see figure  [ fig : hires_demo ] ) .",
    "we compare the source list from the first image with the master source list to correct the summed image in the same manner used for the low - resolution mosaics .",
    "* further coordinate correction : * after our initial processing of the public archive we found that the pipeline coordinate correction ( done by _ omichain _ ) using the usno catalogue failed for @xmath14% of the fields .",
    "further , the failure was not limited to extremely high or extremely low source densities ( see figure  [ fig : bad_corr ] ) .",
    "we thus found it worthwhile to create our own coordinate correction routine ( the `` post - pipeline '' correction ) using the usno catalogue .",
    "although the bulk of fields need only a small correction , some fields need substantial corrections ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , although we attempt to find high precision corrections for all fields , it is still worthwhile to find lower accuracy corrections for those fields that do not have a large enough number of matches with the usno catalogue to attempt a high precision solution .",
    "we used a fairly simple and robust algorithm for matching the om sources to the usno sources . if there were @xmath16 matches we iteratively solved for the offset in @xmath12 that minimized the offset between the om source list with the usno source list . by iterating the solution we could eliminate some portion of the false matches .",
    "we have not solved for a rotation for two reasons : 1 ) adding a rotation to the fit did not significantly improve the solution , and 2 ) given that there are systematic offsets from one science window to another , the rotation could be strongly biased by the offset of a single science window .",
    "if there were @xmath17 matches we merely calculated the mean offset between the om and usno sources , and used that offset as the coordinate correction .",
    "if there were @xmath18 sources we did not attempt a correction .",
    "we applied the same correction to the individual images that we applied to the source lists .    for each om source in the source list with the _ omichain_-calculated maximum - liklihood significance in any filter @xmath19",
    ", the matching algorithm finds the closest usno source .",
    "it then creates the distribution of the distances between the om sources and their closest usno counterparts .",
    "if all of the om sources had usno counterparts , then this distribution would be a gaussian whose width is the coordinate uncertainties of the two catalogues and whose peak is the offset between the two catalogues .",
    "if there were no true matches between the om sources and the usno catalogue , then the distribution would be given roughly by the probability distribution for the minimum distance between a given point and a uniform distribution of sources : @xmath20 } \\rho\\pi[(r+\\delta r)^2-r^2 ] e^{\\left[-\\rho\\pi [ ( r+\\delta r)^2-r^2]\\right]}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the surface density of sources and @xmath22 is the binsize of one s histogram of distances . for this distribution both the peak of the distribution and the width of the distribution scale as @xmath23 .",
    "we expect that some fraction of the om sources have true usno matches and that the remainder will not . as a result",
    ", the observed distribution of sources has a sharp peak with a width of @xmath24 due to matches and a low , broad distribution for the spurious matches .",
    "this algorithm has problems with high density regions ; for source densities of 5000 sources / image ( 0.005 sources arcsec@xmath25 ) the distribution of spurious matches peaks at @xmath26 with the lower half - maximum at @xmath27 .",
    "although the peak of the matching sources typically has @xmath28 , the true match rate is likely to be small compared to the spurious match rate , and so it is difficult , if not impossible , to find the true match peak in this distribution .",
    "however , at these source densities , source confusion is a serious problem as well , so even if the matching algorithm worked , the coordinate solution would remain problematic .    for the matching algorithm , we simply fit the distribution with a gaussian .",
    "if the width of the gaussian is smaller than @xmath29 , then the algorithm takes all of the sources within @xmath30 of the peak of the distribution as real matches .",
    "an initial solution is determined from those matches , and a fit is made in the image coordinate frame to find the @xmath12 offset that minimizes the distance between the om sources and their usno matches .",
    "the source matching is redone with the new offset , and the process is iterated until it converges . after application of our coordinate correction routines ,",
    "only @xmath31% of the fields remained without any coordinate correction .",
    "besides fields with very few objects , the fields without coordinate corrections were characterized by very broad distribution of the matches suggesting a combination of large pointing error and large source density , and thus a large number of spurious identifications .    for fields where the pipeline processing found a good coordinate solution using the usno catalogue our coordinate correction was not significantly different .",
    "however , our coordinate correction did improve the mean distance between om and usno sources for @xmath32% of fields , and provided the only coordinate corrections for @xmath33% of fields .",
    "( figure  [ fig : bad_corr ] )    the rms residual between the om sources and the matching usno sources was calculated for every field .",
    "a value of zero indicates that there was no coordinate solution .",
    "coordinate solutions with rms residuals @xmath34 should be considered to be poor .",
    "* fast mode processing : * the bulk of the fast mode processing is concerned with the production of light - curves of the source .",
    "the fast mode images consist of @xmath11 regions containing , typically , a single source .",
    "we combine all of the images for each filter using the same method applied to the high - resolution images .",
    "* further processing : * further processing is required to provide a more useful source list to be incorporated into the omcat . to the standard image catalogue ( a binary fits table ) we add images of each source from each filter .",
    "each `` postage stamp '' image is @xmath35 pixels in size , extracted from the low - resolution image mosaics ( the pixel size is @xmath36 and the image is @xmath37 in size ) .",
    "since the sources were derived from all of the science windows , some sources can fall in high - resolution science windows without low - resolution counterparts . in that case",
    "the postage stamp is extracted from the high - resolution image and binned to the same resolution and size as the other postage stamps .",
    "sources that appear only in `` fast '' science windows are treated similarly .",
    "note that postage stamps are extracted from all of the available filters , not just the filters for which the source was detected ; many postage stamps may thus appear to be empty .",
    "* processing summary : * for each obsid our processing produces a coordinate corrected source list , a coordinate corrected low - resolution mosaicked image for each filter , a coordinate corrected high - resolution mosaicked image for each filter ( if possible ) , or a summed fast mode image .",
    "* caveats : * 1 ) individual science windows may be significantly offset ( 1 - 2@xmath38 ) from the remainder of the mosaic . in this case",
    "the correction by use of the usno - b1 catalogue will not be wholly satisfactory , and sources will appear to be offset in the postage stamps . the extent of this problem for any individual source can determined by looking at the `` rms_resid '' column which contains the rms residual from the fit of source list to the usno - b1 catalogue .",
    "\\2 ) the source lists will contain spurious sources , sources due to ghost images , diffraction spikes , readout streaks , saturation around bright sources , and other effects .",
    "some of these sources can be removed by consulting the data quality flag ( q_flag parameter ) similarly , confused sources are flagged by the c_flag parameter .",
    "however , we have found that filtering out sources with signal - to - noise ratios of less than three was a more efficient means of removing spurious sources than reference to the quality flags .",
    "figure  [ fig : demo_imag ] and figure  [ fig : demo_source ] demonstrate the extent to which the data quality , confusion , and extension flags can be used .",
    "figure  [ fig : demo_imag ] shows an image with typical difficulties : ghosts , readout streaks , and diffraction spikes .",
    "figure  [ fig : demo_source ] shows images of some of the individual sources from the image in figure  [ fig : demo_imag ] .",
    "the first row of images contains uvw1 band images of the first 36 sources in the source list which have q_flag@xmath39 , or good quality sources .",
    "the second row of images contains uvw1 band images of the first 36 sources in the source list which have q_flag@xmath40 , or poor quality sources .",
    "it is clear that some of the `` good quality sources '' are unreliable , while some of the `` poor quality sources '' are reliable .",
    "the third and fourth rows of images contain , respectively , sources with c_flag@xmath39 ( unconfused ) and c_flag@xmath40 ( confused ) ; again the sources are taken in the order of the source list ( which happens to be from low r.a . to high r.a . ) and all images are in the uvw1 band . as can be seen , the confusion flag is not reliable .",
    "the fifth and sixth rows of images contain , respectively , sources with e_flag@xmath39 ( non - extended ) and e_flag@xmath40 ( extended ) ; this flag does seem to be robust .",
    "figure  [ fig : demo_signif ] shows images of some of the individual sources from the image in figure  [ fig : demo_imag ] , selected to demonstrate the effect of the signif parameter .",
    "the top row of images shows the effect of increasing significance , as characterized by the signif parameter in the uvw1 band . for this column of images",
    ", we sorted the sources by signif , and sampled the sequence uniformly to represent the entire range of the signif parameter .",
    "the value of the signif parameter is given directly below the images , and the source signal - to - noise ratio directly below that .",
    "similarly , the bottom row of images samples sources of increasing value of the source signal - to - noise ratio ; the values of the signif parameter and the signal - to - noise ratio are shown below the images .",
    "neither the signif parameter nor the signal - to - noise ratio provides a completely reliable estimator of the reality of a particular source .",
    "\\3 ) although we provide the mosaicked low - resolution and mosaicked high - resolution images through the archive , these images , according to the sas documentation , should not be used for photometry .",
    "there are a number of corrections in the photometric reduction which can not be made from the mosaicked images .",
    "however , since coincidence - loss and dead - time corrections are small for faint sources and faint extended emission , photometry of faint sources using standard non - sas tools is possible from the mosaics , as has been demonstrated by d. hammer ( private communication ) .",
    "\\4 ) although there may be substantial exposure for a given mosaic , the detection limit in the current catalogue is not that of the mosaic since the source detection is done on the individual science windows rather than on the mosaicked images .",
    "since the individual science windows have a median exposure of @xmath41 s , and the bulk of the individual science windows have exposures of 1000 s , the detection limit of the omcat is more uniform but somewhat lower than one would expect from the mosaic exposure times .    *",
    "availability : * the bulk of the data in the omcat can be accessed either through the browse facility at the high energy astrophysics science archive ( heasarc ) or through the multimission archive at stsci ( mast ) .",
    "slightly more information for each source ( shape , confusion flags , and quality flags , as a function of filter ) are retained in the source lists for individual obsids , and can be downloaded from the heasarc with the rest of the om data .",
    "_ observation statistics : _ of the 4373 observations that were public by 1 september 2006 , 2950 observations had om imaging mode data and 202 had om fast mode data .",
    "about 25% of the fields imaged were observed more than once , allowing some measure of temporal variability .",
    "however , the number of fields with multiple observations is a very strongly declining function of the number of repetitions ( see figure  [ fig : dup_stat ] ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : sky_map ] , the galactic plane has a high density of observations ( particularly towards the galactic center ) , the region with @xmath42 has a lower density of observations , and the region with @xmath43 is relatively uniform , though coma and the magellanic clouds have visible concentrations of observations .",
    "the imaging mode observations cover a cumulative @xmath44% of the sky .",
    "figure  [ fig : expo_stat ] shows the distribution of total exposure time per field and the exposure time per science window for the most commonly used filter ( uvw1 ) .",
    "most science windows have exposures of a kilosecond , while the total exposure per field is significantly higher .",
    "thus , since the point source detection is done in the individual science windows , the omcat could be made significantly deeper were point source detection to be executed on mosaicked images .",
    "as noted above , since the bulk of individual science window exposures are @xmath45 seconds , the detection depth of the catalogue is relatively uniform .",
    "however , given the multiple coverage of sources by individual science windows , the actual measurment accuracy is significantly better than that obtained from a single 1000 second exposure . figure  [ fig : stat_mags ] shows the distribution of magnitudes for each filter .",
    "_ coordinate statistics : _ figure  [ fig : stat_resid ] shows the distribution of the residuals between the corrected source catalogues and the usno - b1 catalogue for those fields for which a coordinate correction was successful .",
    "the residuals before the post - pipeline correction are peaked around @xmath46 with a secondary peak around @xmath29 .",
    "after correction , the distribution is more symmetrically distributed around @xmath46 . it should be noted that a portion of the residual for any given image can be due to the offset of individual science windows within the mosaic .    the distribution of the calculated offsets between coordinates before and after the post - pipeline correction by the usno catalogue is shown in figure  [ fig : stat_offs ] .",
    "the distribution is a broad skewed gaussian peaking at @xmath47 with a significant tail extending to @xmath48 .",
    "note that this distribution does not reflect the pointing ability of the telescope , but rather the performance of the tracking corrections in the om pipeline .",

    "( even with identical coverage , one would still expect fewer uvw2 candidates simply because of the lower response in the uvw2 filter . )",

    "the remainder of the sources are uniformly distributed across the high galactic latitude sky and will be useful for the study of the structure of the galactic halo in the manner of @xcite .",
    "we matched the _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalogue ( ssc , the second xmm - newton serendipitous source pre - release catalogue , _ xmm - newton _ survey science centre , 2006 ) against the omcat .",

    "the distribution of the distance between the x - ray sources and the closest om source is shown in figure  [ fig : xo_dist_stat ] ; the sharp peak at @xmath91 is presumably due to true matches between x - ray and om sources while the broader peak is due to uncorrelated sources . in order to determine the extent to which our matches are contaminated by serendipitous alignments , we calculated the probability distribution of equation 1 for each source in the ssc that fell within the om fov using the density of om sources in the fov for the observation containing the ssc source .",
    "because some of the ssc sources do have real matches , this calculation overestimates the probability distribution of serendipitous matches . in order to correct for this overestimation",
    ", we assumed that sources with distances of @xmath92 had a non - negligible probability of being real matches .",
    "we then summed over the probability distribution for @xmath93 and normalized that to the total number of matches found with @xmath93 .",

    "given the observational interest in galaxies , there will also be a small , probably negligible , contribution from extragalactic x - ray binaries and star - forming regions .",
    "the question of interest when comparing catalogues at different energies is whether the x - ray sources detected in the uv fall in distinctive portions of x - ray / uv color / hardness diagrams .",
    "figure  [ fig : color_hard ] compares the uvw1@xmath51u color ( the uv color for which we have the greatest number of sources ) with the 2.0 - 12.0/0.5 - 2.0 kev x - ray hardness . from figure",
    "[ fig : color_color ] , we expect agn to have uvw1@xmath51u@xmath98 and stars to have uvw1@xmath51u@xmath99 . the same behavior is observed in the color - hardness diagram , with an additional separation in x - ray hardness ; the x - ray sources with uv colors of agn have log(hard)-log(soft ) peaked around 0.2 and the x - ray sources with uv colors of stars have a broad distribution peaking at log(hard)-log(soft)@xmath99 .",
    "this distribution reflects the well understood difference between the soft thermal x - ray spectra of stars and the harder power - law x - ray spectra of agn .",
    "the combination of x - ray and uv colors are probably a more powerful star - agn discriminator than either alone .",
    "the diagonal line in figure  [ fig : color_hard ] marks a reasonable separation between these two categories .",
    "to test this separation we have cross - correlated the sources with good x - ray and uv data with the sdss dr5 catalogue of sources with classifications made from the sdss spectra .",
    "indeed , the agn ( blue ) are clustered as expected .",
    "the bulk of the galaxies ( green ) have stellar colors , but many have agn - like colors .",
    "since the sdss sources chosen for spectroscopy were selected to have a low probability of being stars , based on their colors and being unresolved , the low number of stars ( red ) , and that fact that they have agn - like colors , should not be surprising .",
    "the contours in figure  [ fig : hard_uv ] show the density of ssc catalogue sources in the hard ( 2.0 - 12.0 kev ) _ versus _ soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) band space ; the points show the locations of sources with uvw1@xmath51u colors .",
    "not surprisingly , many of the sources with only soft x - ray detections have uv detections while there are only a few sources that have only hard x - ray detections that also have uv detections .",
    "the hard x - ray sources with uv detections tend to have agn - like colors . to state it in the converse , very few hard x - ray sources ( i.e. , strongly absorbed sources ) have uv counterparts .",
    "the ssc sources with uv counterparts that also have qso counterparts in the sdss spectroscopic survey are shown in figure  [ fig : sdss_agn ] . the sources cluster along the tracks expected if the x - ray and uv flux are related by @xmath100 as found by @xcite , where the monochromatic luminosities are in erg s@xmath101 hz@xmath101 .",
    "we assumed the qso template spectrum from @xcite for calculating the uv flux and magnitudes .",

    "assuming internal absorption moves the tracks by @xmath103 , so the effect is not strong for this x - ray energy band .",
    "although there is significantly more scatter than one would expect from the uncertainties , the sources do lie roughly where expected .",
    "it should be noted that this small sample of sources ( _ xmm - newton _  x - ray sources with om counterparts and sdss spectroscopic survey counterparts ) seems to be a relatively unbiased sample of the sdss spectral catalogue ; the distribution of spectroscopic classification and redshift in the sample matches the distribution of all of the sources in the @xmath104 radius sdss spectroscopic catalogue extracts centered on the om pointing directions . with the larger sample of om sources with x - ray counterparts one will be able to begin to address the source of this scatter .",

    "<S> the optical monitor catalogue of serendipitous sources ( omcat ) contains entries for every source detected in the publicly available _ xmm - newton _ optical monitor ( om ) images taken in either the imaging or `` fast '' modes . since the om is coaligned and records data simultaneously with the x - ray telescopes on </S>",
    "<S> _ xmm - newton _ , it typically produces images in one or more near - uv / optical bands for every pointing of the observatory . as of the beginning of 2006 , </S>",
    "<S> the public archive had covered roughly 0.5% of the sky in 2950 fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the omcat is not dominated by sources previously undetected at other wavelengths ; the bulk of objects have optical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> however , the omcat can be used to extend optical or x - ray spectral energy distributions for known objects into the ultraviolet , to study at higher angular resolution objects detected with _ galex _ , or to find high - galactic - latitude objects of interest for uv spectroscopy . </S>"
