    "probabilistic representations of solutions are popular in finance because of the curse of dimensionality which requires the application of monte - carlo methods .",
    "especially , this is true for more intricate problems such as the free boundary problems related to pricing , hedging , and the optimal exercise strategies of american options .",
    "the present work contributes to these problems as it establishes a stable iterative functional solution scheme in a general framework of diffusion type market models .",
    "however , it is also a contribution to the theoretical question of regularity of the free boundary itself where we establish results which are neither covered by the general results of @xcite ( cf .",
    "discusson below ) nor by more special recent regularity results on american derivatives in @xcite .",
    "there are several methods in order to investigate regularity used in the literature .",
    "one is to differentiate equations in order to get equations for derivatives .",
    "another is to find estimates for tangent paraboloids of the solutions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . a second method is to find the solution in explicit form which is possible in a very limited class of problems only . in @xcite",
    "the multivariate case of the parabolic potential problem is investigated , i.e. the case of constant coefficients and with no assumption on the sign of the solution .",
    "the points of the free boundary are classified into regular and singular points by an energy and a density criterion and @xmath0 regularity is proved around the regular points .",
    "singular points are not considered .",
    "hence , the regularity results of the present work which establishes overall regularity especially for the american basket put option are not covered even in the case of the multivariate black - scholes model .",
    "however our results extend to a considerable class of models with variable coefficients . the only condition ( beside regularity conditions on the coefficients )",
    "is a global graph condition which allows for a global transformation of the free boundary ( also known as front - fixing ) .",
    "the method of front fixing itself is discussed in several papers on univariate american options ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) where it is less efficient than a moving boundary approach ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . we shall investigate the american basket put option since it is the most prominent and important example .",
    "regularity results for the american put option in the univariate case go back to @xcite and @xcite in the case of constant coefficients . in @xcite the univariate case is studied in the case of the related stefan problem , and where coefficients depend on time and space . a more recent contribution for american options in the univariate case with variable coefficients",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "in the present work we obtain global regularity results for the american basket put .",
    "however , our method can be applied to the other popular options ( we shall provide a list below ) .",
    "we transform the free boundary problem to a nonlinear problem on a domain homeomorphic to a cube .",
    "then the solution of the free boundary surface is presented in terms of a nonlinear integral equation involving convolutions with transition densities of linear parabolic equations and linear volterra equations .",
    "analysis of these equations leads to regularity results which are simple ( use of banach fixed point theorem ) and charming .",
    "our main result is the global regularity of the free boundary surface except for the final time @xmath1 if a global graph condition is satisfied ( which can be justified for a considerable class of models ) .",
    "the nonlinear integral equation is also the basis for our probabilistic scheme for computing the free boundary function , its time derivative and its spatial derivatives up to second order ( greeks ) .",
    "the only other monte - carlo method for computing the free boundary ( not greeks ) of a multivariate american put option known to the author is described in @xcite .",
    "we reduce the solution of this integral equation to an iteration of the solution of linear equations ( essentially two parabolic equations and a linear volterra integral equation ) .",
    "the corresponding convolutions with the transition density can be computed by wkb approximations ( cf .",
    "recent developments in the computations of greeks with monte - carlo methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that wkb approximations can be a very efficient tool for the computation of greeks for high - dimensional models .",
    "the convergence of the resulting iteration method is based on the regularity results for the free boundary .    the outline of the present article is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the general frame work of market models considered .",
    "we restrict ourselves to diffusion models ( a class of stochastic volatility models can be included ) .",
    "we formulate the free boundary problem to be solved . in principle",
    "the analysis could be extended to some class of models based on levy processes",
    ". however the treatment of global operators in the context of free boundaries leads to additional difficulties which will be considered elsewhere . in section 3",
    "we apply the front fixing method to the market models set up in the previous section .",
    "the free boundary function appears in the coefficients of a nonlinear parabolic operator and is coupled to the boundary conditions .",
    "the smooth fit condition of the original free boundary transforms into a mixed boundary condition on a hyperplane . in section 4",
    "we derive a nonlinear integral equation which characterizes the free boundary and is based on the nonlinear initial boundary value problem characterizing the value function and established in the previous section . in section 5 a proof of the global existence and the regularity of the free boundary function is established .",
    "this is done via the nonlinear integral equation established in the previous section .",
    "the integral equation is shown to determine a map in the banach space of hlder continuous functions with hlder continuous derivatives up to the second order .",
    "note that interior norms are used because the problem is not differentiable at maturity time and only @xmath2 on the boundary hyperplane where the mixed boundary condition is related to the smooth fit condition of the original problem .",
    "the solution of the free boundary function is the fixed point of a nonlinear integral equation in a banach space . in section 6 an iteration scheme for the computation of the free boundary function and its greeks",
    "the description is distributed over four subsections . in the first subsection subproblems related to the nonlinear integral equation characterizing the free boundary function",
    "are identified .",
    "the second subsection recalls some recent results of the wkb - expansion of the transition density ( fundamental solution of linear parabolic equations ) .",

    "some typical stochastic volatility models such as multivariate extensions of heston s model ( or wishart - type models ) do not satisfy a strict ellipticity condition .",
    "there are also semi - elliptic diffusion models where the number of brownian motions is less than the dimensionality of the problem",
    ". some ( but not all ) models of this type satisfy the hrmander condition .",
    "note that for some class of semi - elliptic equations recent techniques in ( @xcite ) may be combined with techniques considered here .",

    "we deal with this situation in the following , where we note that everything can be generalized to the more general incomplete market model without problems if a uniform strict ellipticity condition is satisfied ( the choice of the equivalent measure is a problem of its own ) . in case",

    "it is clear that formally implies that @xmath51 and where global solutions can be obtained under rather mild conditions by variational methods ( cf .",
    "the equivalence of this system of variational inequalities with optimal stopping problems under relatively mild conditions have also be studied extensively ( cf .",

    "the complement of the exercise region in the domain @xmath54 is called the continuation region . in @xcite",
    "it is proved in a rather general context that the optimal stopping time is the first time where the value process hits the boundary of the exercise region .",
    "therefore the free boundary surface ( or the boundary of the exercise region ) is crucial information in dealing with american option . especially in the context of hedging information concerning the greeks",
    "near the free boundary is crucial . in the present article",
