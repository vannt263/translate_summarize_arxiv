    "cinnabar ( @xmath0-hgs ) is the main ore for the production of mercury and , in powdered form , constitutes the red pigment vermillion which was already used in pre - columbian peru as early as 500 bc ( chavin empire ) . large scale mining of cinnabar is known to have taken place after the conquest of the inca empire ( 1532 ad ) in connection with the extraction of silver from low grade ores .",
    "it probably led to the first pre - industrial source of hg environmental pollution .",
    "@xcite evidence for the use of cinnabar as a pigment is also found in mesoamerica , dating back to the olmec culture ( @xmath6800 bc ) , where it was utilized in ceremonial burials and for coloring beautiful ceramic figurines .",
    "@xcite it was mined in quertaro , where nowadays the institute of one of the present authors ( ahr ) is located .    in the eastern world , china , today the main producer of mercury , was early using cinnabar as a pigment .",
    "the best known use is found in the lacquerware of the song dynasty ( 1000 ad ) .",
    "@xcite it is applied , up to now , in traditional chinese medicine ( as zhu sha ) to treat a variety of ailments including colds , insomnia , restlessness and , less dangerously externally , skin disorders .",
    "the interested reader will find in the web abundant therapeutic as well as ordering information .",
    "the extraction of mercury from cinnabar is documented in teophrastus of eresus `` book on stones '' ( @xmath6315 bc )  @xcite : `` native cinnabar was rubbed with vinegar in a copper mortar with a copper pestle '' , thus describing what is probably the first mechano - chemical reaction .",
    "pliny the elder ( 23 - 79 ad ) , in his natural history  @xcite , describes not only the mechano - chemical but also the distillation method which seems to have originated from dioscorides ( 40 - 90 ad ) .    because of the existence of large cinnabar deposits , vermillion was also used to illuminate ancient manuscripts in spain and italy .",
    "the largest world deposits are probably still those of almadn in spain but the mines were closed in 2002 because of the drop in the price of mercury .",
    "the largest producers are now china and kyrgyztan .",
    "beautiful red single crystals of @xmath0-hgs can be pried out of mineral samples .",
    "it is also possible to grow them from the elements using conventional vapor phase techniques .",
    "a method to grow thin films on substrates for possible optoelectronic applications was disclosed in 1974 .",
    "@xcite    although cinnabar is the stable form of hgs under ntp , a zincblende - type modification , metacinnabar ( @xmath1-hgs ) , is also found in nature and can be grown in the laboratory by adding traces of iron ( @xmath61% ) to the elements used in the growth .",
    "the electronic and vibronic properties of metacinnabar have been discussed recently .",
    "@xcite    the present article follows the structure of ref . , with emphasis on the differences between the crystal structure of cinnabar and that of metacinnabar .",
    "cinnabar , e.g. , has three formula units per unit cell  @xcite whereas metacinnabar only has one .",
    "this fact is responsible for a much larger number of ir and raman active phonons in cinnabar than in metacinnabar .",
    "their frequencies are investigated here .",
    "cinnabar has two chiral ( enantiomorphic ) modifications ( space groups no . 152 ( d@xmath7 ) and no .",
    "154 ( d@xmath8 ) , primitive cell composed of two coaxial helices , one with three s atoms , the other with three hg atoms ) .",
    "these modifications rotate the plane of polarization of light propagating along the @xmath9-axis in opposite directions ( optical activity ) .",
    "they also give rise to linear * k * terms in the dispersion relations of phonons and electrons , the latter even in the absence of spin - orbit ( so ) coupling ( linear terms appear in @xmath1-hgs only when so is taken into account ) . in the present work we have measured the specific heat of natural and synthetic crystals of @xmath0-hgs with various isotopic compositions and compared the results with _ ab initio _ calculations based on the electronic band structures mentioned above .",
    "because of the uniaxial crystal structure , there are two different spectra of the dielectric functions , depending on whether the electric field is polarized parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath9-axis .",
    "we have calculated the corresponding electronic spectra and compared them with unpublished experimental data by zallen _",
    "et al._.  @xcite    this work is organized as follows :    section [ sectiontheory ] discusses the details of the theoretical calculations , which use the vasp  @xcite and the abinit set of codes .",
    "@xcite section [ sectionexperimental ] provides necessary experimental details . section [ sectionband ] presents the calculated _ ab initio _ band structures ( with emphasis on so and linear @xmath10 effects ) and the lattice parameters ( including the bulk modulus @xmath11 ) obtained by optimization of the total enthalpy .",
    "section [ sectionoptical ] displays the electronic dielectric functions obtained from the abinit - calculated band structures and compares them with the results obtained by kramers - kronig analysis of the reflectivity spectra measured by zallen _",
    "et al._.@xcite    section [ sectionphonon ] is devoted to the _ ab - initio _ calculation of the phonon dispersion curves and a comparison of the frequencies obtained at the @xmath2-point of the bz with raman and ir measurements .",
    "section [ sectionheat ] discusses the results of our heat capacity measurements and finally section [ sectionconclus ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the calculations reported here have been performed with two different implementations of density functional theory ( dft ) , vasp and abinit : the vienna simulation package vasp ( see refs .   and references therein ) performs _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations with the pseudopotential method and with the spin - polarized density functional theory including a self - consistent treatment of so coupling .",
    "the set of plane waves employed extended up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 370 ev for @xmath0-hgs .",
    "such a large cutoff was required to achieve highly converged results within the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) scheme .",
    "@xcite the semicore 5@xmath4 and 6@xmath12 electrons of hg were included explicitly in the calculations .",
    "the paw method takes into account the full nodal character of the all electron charge density distribution in the core region .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy was initially taken in the local density approximation ( lda ) with the ceperley alder prescription  @xcite of the exchange - correlation energy , and we also employed the generalized gradient approximation , gga , with the pbe prescription .",
    "@xcite we used a dense monkhorst - pack grid for brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations in order to assure highly converged results to about 1 - 2 mev per formula unit .",
    "we also utilized an accurate procedure in the calculations in order to obtain very well converged forces which were used for the calculation of the dynamical matrix . at each selected volume , the structures were fully relaxed to their equilibrium configuration through the calculation of the forces on atoms and the stress tensor  @xcite . in the relaxed equilibrium configuration ,",
    "the forces are less than 0.004 ev /   and the deviation of the stress tensor from a diagonal hydrostatic form is less than 1 kbar ( 0.1 gpa ) .    in the abinit implementation@xcite ,",
    "only the valence electrons are taken into account by using the hartwigsen - goedecker - hutter relativistic separable dual - space pseudopotentials@xcite with an energy cutoff of 60 ha .",
    "a detailed testing was performed to ensure convergence at the chosen cutoff . a local density approximation ( lda )",
    "was used for the exchange - correlation hamiltonian , but some tests were also performed with the pbe - gga exchange correlation hamiltonian@xcite ; only small differences were found .",
    "a grid of 6@xmath136@xmath134 was used to describe electronic and vibrational properties of @xmath0-hgs in both symmetry groups .",
    "several tests were performed with finer grids to check our results .",
    "after convergence was reached , an inner stress within the unit cell of 1@xmath1310@xmath14 gpa remained .",
    "geometrical relaxation was performed up to forces less than 3x10@xmath14 ev /  .",
    "the abinit code was used to obtain the optical and the vibrational properties . in the latter case we used the response function implementation.@xcite the dynamical matrices",
    "were calculated for a grid of 6@xmath136@xmath133 and four different grid shifts , with a total of 83 matrices ( including the @xmath2 point ) .",
    "after obtaining the matrices , a fourier interpolation was used , as implemented in the set of abinit codes ( anaddb ) described in ref . , to increase the density of * q * points . however , in order to calculate the optical properties we used the abinit implementation in two different versions : ( a ) calculation of the electronic interband transitions , as described in ref . and ( b ) a different approach , where an inversion of the dielectric matrix is performed as described in refs .  .",
