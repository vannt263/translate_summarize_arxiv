    "the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is a key factor in determining the size scale of the universe .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty in the length of this `` cosmic meter stick '' is responsible for much of the current uncertainty in the value of the hubble constant , as noted by mould et al .",
    "the lmc distance is as controversial as it is important .",
    "existing determinations span a wide range ( see fig . 1 of mould et al . ) and are often grouped into the `` long '' distance scale results ( @xmath4 kpc and ( @xmath5 mag ) and the `` short '' distance scale results ( @xmath6 kpc and ( @xmath7 mag ) . in some cases ,",
    "the same technique ( e.g. , cepheids ) can support both the long and short scales , depending on the assumptions and details of the analysis .",
    "reviews of lmc distance determinations can be found in westerlund ( 1997 ) and cole ( 1998 ) , and numerous new papers have appeared in the last several years , indicating the high activity level and interest in the field .",
    "recently , we showed that well - detached main sequence b - type eclipsing binary ( eb ) systems are ideal standard candles and have the potential to resolve the lmc distance controversy ( guinan et al . 1998a ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the advantages of using ebs are numerous .",
    "first , an accurate distance can be determined for each individual system  and there are many systems .",
    "this is in contrast to techniques that utilize , for example , cepheids or red giant stars , where entire populations are used to derive a single distance estimate",
    ". it also contrasts with analyses of sn 1987a , which have the potential to yield a precise distance but for which there is only one object to study .",
    "the ebs can provide not only the mean lmc distance , but also can be used to probe the structure of the lmc .",
    "second , the analysis involves well - understood objects in a well - understood phase of stellar evolution ( core hydrogen burning ) and the results for each object can be verified independently by  but do not depend on  stellar evolution theory .",
    "third , the analysis is robust and not subject to any zeropoint uncertainties , nor are there any adjustable parameters .",
    "for example , the results are extremely insensitive to stellar metallicity , although the metallicity of the individual ebs is explicitly determined and incorporated in the analysis .",
    "likewise , the determination of interstellar extinction is an integral part of the analysis of each object .",
    "the study of the eb system hv  2274 in paper i yielded a distance of @xmath8 kpc and stellar properties consistent with stellar evolution theory ( ribas et al .",
    "2000a ) . correcting for the position of hv  2274 relative to the lmc center yielded a lmc distance of @xmath9 kpc corresponding to @xmath10 mag .",
    "this result argues strongly in favor of the `` short distance '' to the lmc .",
    "since paper i , several partial - reanalyses of the hv  2274 system have appeared in the literature ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ; nelson et al .",
    "2000 ; groenewegen & salaris 2001 ) .",
    "these authors advocate various adjustments in the results from paper i which yield lmc distance moduli in the range 18.2218.42 mag .",
    "these adjustments all stem from complications arising from the incorporation of optical photometry in the analysis .",
    "we will return to this issue later in this paper .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to apply our analysis to a second lmc eb system , hv  982 , and derive its stellar properties and distance .",
    "this eb , with @xmath11 , consists of two mildly evolved main sequence b stars each corresponding to spectral class @xmath0b1 iv ",
    "a key difference between this analysis and that presented in paper i for hv  2274 is that we have here obtained space - based spectrophotometric measurements extending from 1150  to 7500  , eliminating the reliance on optical photometry .",
    "these new data preclude the ambiguities which plague the hv  2274 result and allow us to realize the full potential of our analysis technique . in  2 , we describe the data included in this study . in  3 , the analysis  which incorporates the light curve , radial velocity curve , and spectral energy distribution of the system  is discussed .",
    "some aspects of our results relating to the interstellar medium towards hv  982 are described in  4 , including an indication of the relative location of hv  982 within the lmc .",
    "the general stellar properties of the hv  982 system and their consistency with stellar evolution theory are described in  5 . in  6 ,",
    "we show how the distance to the system is derived from our analysis , and compare this result with a reanalysis of the hv  2274 data .",
    "we discuss the distance to the lmc and summarize our conclusions from study of two binary systems in  7 .",
    "three distinct datasets are required to carry out our analyses of the lmc eb systems : high - resolution spectroscopy ( yielding radial velocity curves ) , precise differential photometry ( yielding light curves ) , and multiwavelength spectrophotometry ( yielding temperature and reddening information ) .",
    "each of these three is described briefly below .",
    "note that in this paper , the primary ( `` p '' ) and secondary ( `` s '' ) components of the hv  982 system are defined photometrically and refer to the hotter and cooler components , respectively . as we will show , the primary star is the less luminous and less massive of the pair .",
    "radial velocity curves for hv 982 , and a number of other lmc ebs , were derived from optical echelle spectra obtained by us during 6-night and 8-night observing runs in january and december 2000 , respectively , with the blanco 4-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory in chile .",
    "the seeing conditions during the two runs ranged between 0.7 and 1.8 arcsec .",
    "we secured eighteen spectra of hv  982  near orbital quadratures  covering the wavelength range 36005500   , with a spectral resolution of @xmath12 , and a s / n of @xmath020:1 .",
    "the plate scale of the data is 0.08    pix@xmath13 ( 5.3  km  s@xmath13  pix@xmath13 ) and there are 2.6 pixels per resolution element .",
    "identical instrumental setups were used for both observing runs .",
    "the exposure time per spectrum was 1800 sec , sufficiently short to avoid significant radial velocity shifts during the integrations .",
    "all the hv  982 observations were bracketed with thar comparison spectra for proper wavelength calibration .",
    "the raw images were reduced using standard noao / iraf tasks ( including bias subtraction , flat field correction , sky - background subtraction , cosmic ray removal , extraction of the orders , dispersion correction , merging , and continuum normalization ) .",
    "spectra of radial velocity standard stars were acquired and reduced with the same procedure .",
    "visual inspection of the hv  982 spectra revealed prominent h balmer lines and conspicuous lines of he  i ( 4009 , 4026 , 4144 , 4388 , 4471 , and 4922   ) .",
    "various features due to ionized c , si , and o are also expected , but with strengths comparable to the noise level in the individual spectra . for illustration , three 200-  sections of one of the observed spectra are shown in figure [ figspec ] . the strongest he  i features and the h  i balmer lines are labeled , with arrows marking the expected line positions for the two components of the system ( according to the radial velocity curve solution described in  3.2 ) .",
    "this spectrum was obtained at orbital phase 0.725 and illustrates the clean velocity separation of the two components of the binary .",
    "ccd differential photometric observations of hv  982 were reported by pritchard et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter p98 ) . these data were obtained between 1992 and 1995 with a 1-m telescope at mt .",
    "john university observatory ( new zealand ) .",
    "the resultant light curves in the strmgren @xmath14 , johnson @xmath15 and cousins @xmath16 passbands have very good phase coverage , with 132 , 565 , and 205 measurements , respectively .",
    "more sparsely - covered light curves were obtained in the strmgren @xmath17 passbands , with 48 , 45 , and 44 measurements for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the precision of the individual differential photometric measurements is @xmath21  mag .",
    "we obtained spectrophotometric observations of hv  982 at uv and optical wavelengths with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ on 31 january 1997 , at binary phase 0.533 .",
    "data were obtained in four wavelength regions , using the g130h , g190h , g270h , and g400h observing modes of the fos with the 3.7x 1.3 aperture , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "the dataset names are y3fu5503 t , y3fu5506 t , y3fu5505 t , and y3fu5504 t , respectively .",
    "the data were processed and calibrated using the standard pipeline processing software for the fos .",
    "the four individual observations were merged to form a single spectrum which covers the range 1145  to 4790  .",
    "additional _ hst _ observations of hv  982 were obtained on 22 april 2001 , at binary phase 0.621 , using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "data were obtained in the g430l and g750l observing modes with the 52 x 0.5 aperture , yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath23 .",
    "the dataset names are o665a8030 and o665a8040 .",
    "the data were processed and calibrated using the standard pipeline processing software .",
    "cosmic ray blemishes were cleaned `` by hand '' and the spectra were trimmed to the regions 35105690  and 54107490  for the g430l and g750l data , respectively .",
    "because of concerns about photometric stability the two stis spectra were not merged ( see  3.3.3 ) .",
    "our study of hv  982 depends on three separate but interdependent analyses .",
    "these involve the radial velocity curve , the light curve , and the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the combined results provide essentially a complete description of the gross physical properties of the hv  982 system and a precise measurement of its distance .",
    "each of the three analyses is described below .        to determine the radial velocities of the hv  982 components ,",
    "we restricted our attention to the 40005000   wavelength region of the spectra described in  2.1 .",
    "data at higher and lower wavelengths were badly contaminated with h balmer lines , or had very poor s / n , or both . as is well known ,",
    "the broad h balmer lines are generally not suitable for radial velocity work because of blending effects , which may lead to systematic underestimation of radial velocity amplitudes ( see , e.g. , andersen 1975 ) . in the 40005000  range ,",
    "the h@xmath24 , h@xmath25 and h@xmath26 lines were masked by setting the normalized flux to unity in a window around their central wavelength .",
    "our initial approach for measuring radial velocities was to use the cross - correlation technique , with a very high s / n ( @xmath0250 ) spectrum of hr  1443 ( @xmath26  cae , b2  iv - v , @xmath27  km  s@xmath13 ) as the velocity template .",
    "two clean cross - correlation function peaks ( one per stellar component ) were clearly visible for all the object spectra as might be anticipated from figure [ figspec ] .",
    "this allowed us to determine individual velocities with accuracies of 10 - 15  km  s@xmath13 . a number of tests , however , indicated that the resulting velocities were moderately dependent on the filtering parameters used .",
    "this phenomenon adds a component of subjectivity to the measured radial velocities , and prompted us to move to an alternate , and ultimately superior , technique .",
    "`` spectral disentangling '' is an improvement over classical cross - correlation because it essentially uses information from the entire spectral dataset to derive the individual radial velocities .",
    "the basic idea of the technique is very simple : an individual ( observed ) double - lined spectrum is assumed to be a linear combination of two single - lined spectra ( one per component ) at different relative velocities ( determined by the orbital phase at the time of observation ) .",
    "the goal is to retrieve the two single - line spectra and the set of relative velocities for each observed spectrum by considering the whole dataset simultaneously .",
    "the numerical implementation is an inversion algorithm of an over - determined system of linear equations .",
    "in contrast with cross - correlation , this technique eliminates the need for a spectral template , but it does require a homogeneous dataset of spectra taken at a variety of orbital phases .",
    "the practical implementation of the disentangling method has been carried out using two independent approaches : simon & sturm ( 1994 ) based their algorithm on a singular value decomposition , and hadrava ( 1995 , 1997 ) employed a fourier transform . in principle , the two implementations are equally valid and we decided to adopt the fourier disentangling code korel developed by hadrava . we have made a number of modifications to the original fortran source , the most significant of which is an increase of the maximum number of radial velocity bins .    to enhance the performance of the disentangling algorithm",
    ", we provided korel with orbital information ( period , time of periastron passage , eccentricity , longitude of periastron ) so a reasonable set of starting values for the velocity semiamplitudes could be computed ( hadrava 2001 , priv .",
    "comm . ) . several korel runs from different initial conditions",
    "were performed to ensure the uniqueness of the solution .",
    "the final heliocentric radial velocities derived from all the ctio spectra using the procedure outlined above are listed in table [ tabrv ] ( `` rv@xmath28 '' and `` rv@xmath29 '' ) , along with the date of observation and the corresponding phase .",
    "the individual errors of the velocities are not provided by korel and a reliable estimation is not straightforward .",
    "this issue is addressed in more detail in  3.2 .    as noted above , the individual spectra for the two components",
    "are also products of the analysis .",
    "since they combine information from all the data , the quality of these two spectra is significantly improved with respect to the individual observations .",
    "figure [ figsecon ] shows a comparison of the disentangled spectrum of the secondary star , i.e , the more massive and luminous component , with a synthetic spectrum computed using r.l .",
    "_ atlas9 _ atmosphere models , ivan hubeny s spectral synthesis program _ synspec _ , and the appropriate stellar properties ( i.e. , @xmath30 = 23600 k , @xmath31 = 3.72 , @xmath32 = -0.3}$ ] , and @xmath33 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "note that the products of korel are two spectra that have not been corrected for `` light dilution , '' i.e. , the continuum level contains the light contribution from the two components and thus the absorption lines are diluted to roughly half their true strengths .",
    "the spectrum in figure [ figsecon ] has had the primary s contribution removed and then been renormalized .",
    "the contribution of the primary was determined using the line strengths in the synthetic spectrum as a reference .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath34 for the model was also determined by comparing the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "the derivations of the basic stellar properties which serve as inputs for the synthetic spectrum calculations are described below in the rest of  3 and all the stellar properties are summarized in  5 .",
    "the significance of the derived @xmath34 value is also discussed in  5 .    as can be seen in figure [ figsecon ] , the agreement between the disentangled and synthetic spectra is excellent , including not only the depths of all the features but also the profile shapes of both the he i and h i balmer lines .",
    "( recall that the balmer lines were masked out when obtaining radial velocities , but a final run of korel with no free parameters was carried out to extract the complete spectrum that we show in figure [ figsecon ] . )",
    "the disentangled spectrum of the primary star is nearly identical to that of the secondary and shows similarly good agreement with a synthetic spectrum computed using the appropriate stellar properties ( i.e. , @xmath30 = 24200 k , @xmath31 = 3.78 , @xmath35 = -0.3}$ ] , and @xmath36 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "these comparisons provide a `` reality check '' for korel and , as will be shown in  5 , give valuable confirmation for some of the basic results of our overall analysis .",
    "the radial velocity data were analyzed using an improved version of the wilson - devinney program ( wilson & devinney 1971 ; hereafter wd ) that includes an atmosphere model routine developed by milone et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the computation of the stellar radiative parameters .",
    "the full analysis can potentially yield determinations of the component velocity semi - amplitudes @xmath37 ( or , equivalently , the mass ratio @xmath38 ) , the systemic velocity @xmath25 , the orbital semi - major axis @xmath39 , the eccentricity @xmath40 , and the longitude of the periastron @xmath41 . in our particular case",
    ", we adopted the very well - determined value of @xmath40 from the light curve solution (  3.2 ) .",
    "it is not possible , however , to utilize the value of @xmath41 yielded by the light curve analysis without first correcting for the significant apsidal motion of the system ( an increase in @xmath41 of about 12@xmath42 between the epoch of p98 s observations and ours ) . instead of using the empirical apsidal motion rate",
    ", we treated @xmath41 as a free parameter and obtained a best fit for the mean epoch of our data ( j2000.5 ) .",
    "thus , solutions were run in which @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath25 , and @xmath41 were the adjustable parameters .",
    "our best fit to the radial velocity curve is shown in figure [ figrv ] .",
    "note that the details of the curve shape ( such as its skewness and the abrupt changes during eclipse ) are not a product of the radial velocity analysis , but rather result from the adopted light curve solution and from the physical effect of partially - eclipsed rotating stars ( the `` rossiter effect '' ) .",
    "the fit residuals ( indicated as `` o  c '' in the figure and in the last two columns of table [ tabrv ] ) correspond to r.m.s .",
    "errors of @xmath01.5  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "this small internal error gives an indication of the good quality of the spectroscopic data and the excellent performance of the disentangling technique .",
    "the best - fitting parameters to the radial velocity curve are listed in table [ tabparms ] .",
    "the uncertainties quoted in the table bear some comment .",
    "indeed , the formal errors derived from the fit to the radial velocity curve are significantly smaller . for example",
    ", the wd program returns an estimated uncertainty of only @xmath00.5  km  s@xmath13 in the velocity semiamplitudes . while formally correct , this uncertainty may be underestimated because it fails to account for any systematic effects that may be present in the data .",
    "as discussed by hensberge , pavlovski , & verschueren ( 2000 ) , more realistic estimates of the uncertainty in the velocity semiamplitudes follow from considering the scatter of the velocities derived from the analysis of separate spectral regions .",
    "thus , we divided our entire spectrum into four wavelength intervals and analyzed these separately with korel .",
    "the standard deviation of the resulting velocities turned out to be 3.2  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "this is most likely an overestimate of the true error of the velocities because of the spectral coverage being significantly degraded ( and so the number of spectral lines available for radial velocity determination ) .",
    "nonetheless , we conservatively adopted 3.2  km  s@xmath13 as the uncertainty of the velocity semiamplitudes and scaled the rest of the parameter errors listed in table [ tabparms ] accordingly .",
    "p98 ran simultaneous solutions for the 6 available light curves using the same version of the wd program described above .",
    "the wd program was run in an iterative mode in order to explore the full - extent of parameter space and also to make a realistic estimation of the errors .",
    "furthermore , the authors considered different mass ratios ranging between 0.9 and 1.1 ( since no spectroscopic observations were available at that time ) and found the light curve solution to be completely insensitive to changes within this range .    as often occurs for eclipsing binary stars in eccentric orbits , several parameter sets",
    " four in this case  were found to yield equally good fits to the observed light curves .",
    "the main distinction among the possible solutions is that p98 s cases 1 and 2 predict the primary star to be somewhat smaller and hotter than the secondary ( with relative luminosity in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 spectral regions of @xmath43_{v , i } \\simeq 1.1 $ ] ) , while cases 3 and 4 yield a bigger and cooler primary ( @xmath44_{v , i } \\simeq 0.9 $ ] ) .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken only by considering some external source of information , e.g. , a spectroscopically - determined luminosity ratio . without access to such information ,",
    "p98 were unable to favor any of their four cases .",
    "the disentangled spectra discussed above provide such a spectroscopic luminosity ratio and allow us to distinguish between p98 s two general scenarios . as noted in  3.1 , the comparison of the disentangled spectra with synthetic spectra yields values of @xmath34 for both stars and their light dilution factors , which are related to their luminosities in the blue ( @xmath45 ) spectral region .",
    "the ratio of these dilution factors yields @xmath44_b = 1.15\\pm0.05 $ ] , clearly favoring cases 1 and 2 , in which the primary star is smaller and hotter than the secondary .",
    "note that these cases are also the physically preferable ones , since our radial velocity analysis shows the secondary star to be the more massive member of this non - interacting main sequence system and , therefore , necessarily the more luminous star .    in an attempt to distinguish between p98 s cases 1 and 2",
    ", we redid the light curve analysis published by p98 using an identical computational setup ( i.e. , the iterative wd program ) .",
    "we applied the wd program to the observed light curves both individually and as a group , constraining the spectroscopically - determined mass ratio @xmath38 and trying a variety of weighting schemes for the different bandpasses .",
    "the tests revealed p98 s case 1 to be a spurious solution caused by excessive weight on the strmgren @xmath14 light curve .",
    "this solution never appeared in the analysis of the well - covered @xmath15 and @xmath16 light curves .",
    "therefore , our results clearly favor p98 s case 2 over the others . in figure [ figlc ]",
    "we illustrate this solution to the @xmath15 and @xmath16 light curves .",
    "the final orbital and stellar parameters adopted from the light curve analysis are listed in table [ tabparms ] .",
    "these were derived from a simultaneous solution to all the bandpasses , weighted by their observational errors .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the _ relative _ stellar radii , i.e. , the physical radii divided by the orbital semi - major axis @xmath39 .",
    "note that the fractional radii listed are those corresponding to a sphere with the same volume as the roche equipotential ( `` volume radius '' ) .",
    "the final step in the analysis of hv  982 is modeling the observed shape of the uv / optical energy distribution .",
    "this procedure is the same as that used for hv  2274 ( see paper i ) , and is based on the technique developed by fitzpatrick & massa ( 1999 ; hereafter fm99 ) .",
    "the analysis consists of a non - linear least squares determination of the optimal values of all the parameters which contribute to the right side of equation 1 .",
    "we represent the stellar surface fluxes with r. l. kurucz s _ atlas9 _ atmosphere models , which each depend on four parameters : effective temperature ( @xmath30 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath31 ) , metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) , and microturbulence velocity ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "in addition , we utilize the six - term parametrization scheme from fitzpatrick & massa ( 1990 ) and the recipe given by fitzpatrick ( 1999 ; hereafter f99 ) to construct the wavelength dependent uv - through - ir extinction curve @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in principle , the problem can involve solving for two sets of four kurucz model parameters , the ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath54 , six extinction curve parameters for @xmath58 , and @xmath61 .    for hv",
    "982 , several simplifications can be made which reduce the number of parameters to be determined : ( 1 ) the temperature ratio of the two stars is known from the light curve analysis ; ( 2 ) the surface gravities can be determined by combining results from the light and radial velocity curve analyses and are log g = 3.78 and 3.72 for the primary and secondary stars , respectively ( see  5 ) ; ( 3 ) the values of [ m / h ] and @xmath57 can be assumed to be identical for both components ; ( 4 ) the ratio @xmath60 is known ; and ( 5 ) the standard mean value of @xmath62 found for the milky way can reasonably be assumed given the existing lmc measurements ( e.g. , koornneef 1982 ; morgan & nandy 1982 ; see  4 ) . with these simplifications in place , we modeled the observed uv / optical energy distribution of hv  982 solving for the best - fitting values of @xmath63 , [ m / h]@xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath59 , @xmath54 , and six @xmath58 parameters .      prior to the fitting procedure ,",
    "the three spectrophotometric datasets ( one merged fos spectrum and two stis spectra ) were ( 1 ) velocity - shifted to bring the centroids of the stellar features to rest velocity ; ( 2 ) corrected for the presence of a strong interstellar h  i ly@xmath66 absorption feature in the fos spectrum at 1215.7  ; and ( 3 ) binned to match the _",
    "atlas9 _ wavelength scale .",
    "the ly@xmath66 correction was performed by dividing the spectrum by the intrinsic ly@xmath66 profile corresponding to a total h i column density of @xmath67 , distributed in an lmc component and a milky way foreground component .",
    "the determination of the column densities is discussed in more detail in  4 below .",
    "the binning was accomplished by forming simple unweighted means within the individual wavelength bins of the _ atlas9 _ models . in the wavelength range relevant to this study ,",
    "the bin sizes are typically 10  ( for @xmath68  ) and 20  ( for @xmath69  ) .",
    "the statistical errors assigned to each bin were computed in the usual way from the statistical errors of the original data , i.e. , @xmath70 , where the @xmath71 are the statistical errors of the individual spectrophotometric data points within the bin .",
    "for all the spectra , these uncertainties typically lie in the range 0.5% to 1.5% of the binned fluxes .",
    "note that we do not merge the fos and stis data into a single spectrum , but rather perform the fit on the three binned spectra simultaneously and independently .",
    "this is because stis is less photometrically stable than fos and there are likely to be flux zeropoint offsets among the spectra ( see the instrument handbooks for fos and stis available online at www.stsci.edu ) .",
    "we account for this effect in the fitting procedure by assuming that the fos data represent the true flux levels and including two zeropoint corrections ( one for each stis spectrum ) to be determined by the fit .",
    "we later explicitly determine the uncertainties in the results introduced by zeropoint errors in fos .",
    "the nominal weighting factor for each bin in the least squares procedure is given by @xmath72 .",
    "we exclude a number of individual bins from the fit ( i.e. , set the weight to zero ) for the reasons discussed by fm99 ( mainly due to the presence of interstellar gas absorption features ) .",
    "the best - fitting values of the energy distribution parameters and their 1-@xmath73 uncertainties are listed in tables [ tabparms ] ( stellar properties ) , [ tabstis ] ( stis offsets ) , and [ tabext ] ( extinction curve parameters ) .",
    "a comparison between the observed spectra and the best - fitting model is shown in figure [ figsed ] .",
    "the three binned spectra are plotted separately in the figure for clarity ( small filled circles ) . the zeropoint offset corrections ( see table [ tabstis ] ) were applied to all stis spectra in figure [ figsed ] .",
    "note that we show the quantity @xmath74f@xmath75 as the ordinate in figure [ figsed ] ( rather than f@xmath75 ) strictly for plotting purposes , to `` flatten out '' the energy distributions .",
    "our final fit to the hv  982 energy distribution was computed after adjusting the weights in the fitting procedure to yield a final value of @xmath76 .",
    "although figure [ figsed ] shows that the model provides an extremely good fit to the data , nevertheless the overall r.m.s .",
    "deviation of @xmath02.4@xmath77 is significantly larger than the statistical errors of the individual data bins . with no adjustments , the formal reduced",
    "@xmath78 would be much greater than one ( 4.6 in this case ) .",
    "this is , in general , an expected result since the observational uncertainties from which @xmath78 is computed include statistical errors only and are thus certainly underestimates .",
    "in addition , it is unlikely that the absolute photometric calibration of the data , the extinction curve representation , or the atmosphere models are perfect representations of reality .",
    "the rationale for adjusting the fitting weights is to yield more realistic estimates of the parameter uncertainties , which scale as @xmath79 .",
    "the adjustment of the weights could be accomplished in a number of ways , most simply by either scaling upward the statistical errors of each bin by a single factor ( 2.1 in this case ) or by quadratically combining the statistical errors with an overall uncertainty represented as a fraction of the local binned flux ( 2% in this case ) . for hv  982",
    "we adopted the latter technique , although both yield virtually identical results ( which are indistinguishable from the no - adjustment case ) .",
    "note that this procedure is not rigorously justifiable , since it implies that the discrepancies between the model and the data are due entirely to underestimated observational errors .",
    "however , the resultant parameter uncertainties do appear reasonable for those cases when an external check is possible .",
    "we have such comparisons for two parameters : ( 1 ) @xmath80  as we will show in  6 below , the values of t@xmath81 , with their attendant uncertainties , are completely consistent with expectations from stellar evolution calculations ; ( 2 ) @xmath31  the fitting procedure utilizes the surface gravities determined from the binary analysis .",
    "however @xmath31 can also be determined directly from the energy distributions .",
    "when we fit the hv  982 spectrum , constraining only the difference in @xmath31 between the two components , we find for the primary star a value of @xmath82 , which compares very well with the observed value of @xmath83 from the binary analysis . we conclude that the adopted procedure yields reasonable estimates of the true uncertainties of the parameters determined from the energy distribution analysis .",
    "the values of most of the parameters derived above will be discussed in the sections below .",
    "here we comment briefly only on the results for the stis offsets and e(b - v ) .",
    "the correction factors of 10.4% and 6.4% required to rectify the stis g430l and g750l spectra , respectively , are extremely well - determined and appear surprising large . nevertheless , they are consistent with the stis calibration goals ( of @xmath8410% ) for absolute photometry with the ccd cameras",
    ". the discrepancies may arise from several factors , including the absolute photometric calibration , instrument stability , and possible light loss in the 0.5-wide slit .",
    "the relative roles of these various effects are uncertain at this point .",
    "we have two other lmc binary systems with similar sets of stis and fos spectra ( eros  1044 and hv  5936 ) . in all three cases ,",
    "the stis fluxes are below the fos level , with the g430l data always being the most discrepant .",
    "note that , in the region of overlap between the fos and stis g430l , the _ shapes _ of the spectra agree to within several percent , it is only the general levels that are in discord .",
    "we will examine the cross - calibration of stis and fos using these and other data in a future paper .",
    "an accurate determination of @xmath85 is one of the most critical factors in deriving accurate distances using this analysis  and has been one of the most problematic . in this paper ,",
    "the determination of @xmath86 is straightforward , highly precise , and unambiguous because we have an ideal dataset consisting of spectrophotometry spanning the entire wavelength range over which @xmath87 is defined . in an earlier version of this work ( fitzpatrick et al .",
    "2000 ) , however , we performed the analysis utilizing only fos data ( due to the lack of reliable optical photometry for hv  982 ) and found a much different value of @xmath88 .",
    "it is clear in retrospect that the fos data themselves , which truncate at 4790  , do not extend far enough into the optical region to allow an accurate estimate of @xmath87 . with those data",
    "alone , @xmath89 is wholly determined by only several hundred  of spectrum at the very end of the fos g400h camera and is highly subject to any systematic errors in the fos photometric calibration or in the shape of the adopted extinction curve in this small spectral region .",
    "in fact , we see a strong systematic effect in the analysis of three binaries for which stis data are now available  the fos data alone always yield higher estimates of @xmath87 than when stis spectra ( or reliable optical photometry ) are incorporated in the analysis .",
    "the moral of the story is that a good determination of @xmath87 requires data which span the wavelength range of the johnson @xmath15 and @xmath45 filters , i.e. , the wavelength range over which @xmath87 is defined .",
    "our analysis provides some general information regarding interstellar gas and dust along the hv  982 sightline and also yields some insight into the relative location of the star within the lmc .",
    "this latter point will prove important in interpreting the results from our ensemble of lmc binaries .    as noted in  3.3.2 above",
    ", we find a total h i absorption column density of @xmath90 toward hv  982 .",
    "this consists of an assumed galactic foreground contribution at 0 km s@xmath13 of @xmath91 @xmath92 ( see , e.g. , schwering & israel 1991 ) and an lmc contribution at 260 km s@xmath13 of @xmath93 @xmath92 determined by us from the strength of the interstellar ly@xmath66 absorption line in the fos g130h spectrum .",
    "a conservative estimate of the lmc column density uncertainty is @xmath0@xmath8420% .",
    "the fos data used to derive the h  i measurement are shown in figure [ fighi ] where we plot a small section of the spectrum centered on h  i ly@xmath66 with various stellar and interstellar lines labeled . the spectral resolution and s / n of the data are not sufficient to reveal the complex absorption profiles of the interstellar lines , which span nearly 300 km s@xmath13 in velocity .",
    "the dotted line shows a synthetic spectrum of the hv  982 system , constructed from two individual spectra , velocity shifted to match the stellar velocities at the time of the fos observations .",
    "the individual spectra were computed using _",
    "model atmospheres of the appropriate physical parameters and the spectral synthesis program _",
    "synspec_. the thick solid line shows the synthetic spectrum convolved with an interstellar ly@xmath66 profile computed using the velocities and column densities noted in the paragraph above .",
    "the adopted lmc column density is that which produces the best agreement ( based on visual estimate ) between the convolved spectrum and the data . as can be seen in figure [ fighi ] ,",
    "the agreement is impressive , particularly in the broad damping wings of ly@xmath66 .",
    "note that the non - zero flux seen at line center is due to geocoronal scattering of solar ly@xmath66 photons .",
    "the h  i 21-cm emission line survey of rohlfs et al .",
    "( 1984 ) reveals that the _ total _ lmc h  i column density along the hv  982 line of sight is about @xmath94 @xmath92 , centered at 260 km s@xmath13 ( this velocity was adopted for the ly@xmath66 analysis ) .",
    "this result , combined with the ly@xmath66 determination for h  i _ in front of _ hv  982 , clearly demonstrates that hv  982 is actually located behind most , if not all , of the lmc h  i along its line of sight .",
    "we will return to this point in  8 .",
    "the interstellar extinction curve determined for the hv  982 sightline is shown in figure [ figext ] .",
    "small symbols indicate the normalized ratio of model fluxes to observed fluxes , while the thick solid line shows the parametrized representation of the extinction , which was actually determined by the fitting process .",
    "as noted in  3.3 , the recipe for constructing such a `` custom '' extinction curve is taken from f99 and the parameters defining the curve are listed in table [ tabext ] .",
    "extinction - producing dust grains along the hv  982 line of sight lie in both the milky way and the lmc .",
    "the results of oestreicher , gochermann , & schmidt - kaler ( 1995 ) show that the milky way foreground extinction in this direction corresponds to @xmath95 mag .",
    "combined with our determination of the total value of @xmath85 ( see table [ tabparms ] ) , this indicates an lmc contribution of @xmath96 .",
    "the curve in figure [ figext ] is thus clearly a composite , but weighted more heavily towards the galactic extinction component .",
    "this prevents detailed conclusions about either extinction component , although it is useful to note that the width and position of the remarkably weak 2175  extinction bump are consistent with galactic values ( fitzpatrick & massa 1990 ) .",
    "further , it is reasonable to conclude that the very weak 2175  bump is a feature of both the milky way and lmc extinction components along this sightline .",
    "several of the stars in our lmc distance program have little or no extinction beyond the milky way foreground contribution . for these stars we will be able to derive explicitly the shape of the galactic foreground extinction and perhaps use this result to `` deconvolve '' composite curves such as that for hv  982 .",
    "the `` gas - to - dust '' ratio for the lmc interstellar medium towards hv  982 can be computed from the results above and is @xmath97 .",
    "this value is consistent with the range of values seen by fitzpatrick ( 1986 ) for a variety of lmc sightlines and is significantly higher than the mean milky way value of @xmath98 ( bohlin et al .",
    "1978 ) , which may reflect the lower abundance of metals in the lmc .    a final comment on extinction concerns the value of @xmath61 ( @xmath99 ) . in this analysis",
    "we adopt the mean galactic value of @xmath100 due , essentially , to a lack of any other option .",
    "an individual determination for a relatively lightly - reddened star like hv  982 would require higher precision near - ir photometry than is currently available ( from _ 2mass _ ) .",
    "a correlation between @xmath61 and the slope of extinction in the uv ( as parametrized by the fit coefficient _ @xmath101 _ ) has been shown for a small sample of galactic stars ( f99 ) , but it can not be assumed that such a correlation is applicable to a mixed lmc / galactic halo sightline .",
    "the safest course for our analysis is to adopt a value of @xmath61 and then incorporate a reasonable estimate of its uncertainty in the final error analysis .",
    "as will be shown in  6 , the uncertainty in hv  982 s distance due to @xmath61 is only a small component of the overall error budget .",
    "the results of the analyses described above can be combined to provide a detailed characterization of the physical properties of the hv  982 system .",
    "we summarize these properties in table [ tabstar ] ; notes to the table indicate how the individual stellar properties were derived from the analysis .",
    "it is important to realize that the results in table [ tabstar ] were derived completely independently of any stellar evolution considerations .",
    "thus , stellar structure and evolution models can be used to provide a valuable check on the self - consistency of our empirical results . to test this consistency , we considered the evolutionary models of claret ( 1995 , 1997 ) and claret & gimnez ( 1995 , 1998 ) ( altogether referred to as the cg models ) .",
    "these models cover a wide range in both metallicity ( @xmath102 ) and initial helium abundance ( @xmath103 ) , incorporate the most modern input physics , and adopt a value of 0.2  h@xmath104 as the convective overshooting parameter .",
    "the locations of the hv  982 components in the @xmath105 vs. @xmath106 diagram are shown in figure [ fighrd ] .",
    "the skewed rectangular boxes indicate the 1@xmath73 error locus ( recall that errors in @xmath30 and @xmath107 are correlated ) .",
    "if our results are consistent with stellar evolution calculations , then the evolution tracks corresponding to the masses and metallicity derived from the analysis should pass through the error boxes in the @xmath105 vs. @xmath106 diagram .",
    "indeed , this is the case .",
    "the thin solid lines show the tracks corresponding to zams masses of 11.7 and 11.4 @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( based on the value of @xmath110}$ ] resulting from the spectrophotometry analysis ) .",
    "the models predict that such stars should lose about 0.1 @xmath108 due to stellar winds by the time they reach the positions of the hv  982 stars , yielding the present - day masses of 11.6 and 11.3 @xmath108 .",
    "further , the two stars are compatible with a single isochrone , corresponding to an age of 17.4 myr ( dotted line in figure [ fighrd ] ) .",
    "note that the only adjustable parameter in the model comparison is the initial helium abundance @xmath103 , for which we find an optimal value of @xmath111 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with expectations from empirical chemical enrichment laws ( see ribas et al .",
    "2000b ) .    an additional , independent test of the compatibility of our results and stellar structure theory can be made because the hv  982 system has an eccentric orbit and a well - determined apsidal motion rate ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the value of ( @xmath112 ) can be found by combining the individual results for @xmath41 determined from the light curve and the radial velocity curve analyses ( see table [ tabparms ] ) .",
    "the resultant apsidal motion rate is @xmath113  deg / yr .",
    "this is marginally consistent with the value of @xmath114  deg / yr from p98 , based on eclipse timings , although the error in p98 s result is likely to be underestimated due to large uncertainties in some of the earliest timings .",
    "the expected value of @xmath112 for a binary system can be computed as the sum of a general relativity term ( gr ) and a classical term ( cl ) .",
    "the latter , which is the most important contribution in close systems like hv  982 , depends on the internal mass distributions of the stars , which can be derived from stellar evolution models .",
    "the mass concentration parameters @xmath115 ( i.e , the ratio of the central density to mean density ) for the appropriate cg models ( i.e. , those shown in fig . [ fighrd ] ) are @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "( the error bars reflect the observational uncertainties in the stellar masses . )",
    "these values contain a small correction for stellar rotation effects , according to claret & gimnez ( 1993 ) . using the formulae of claret & gimnez , we compute a classical term of @xmath118  deg / yr and a general relativistic term of @xmath119  deg / yr , yielding a total theoretical apsidal motion rate of @xmath120  deg / yr . this result is in excellent agreement with the observed values , once again demonstrating consistency between our results and stellar interior theory .    note that the eccentric nature of hv  982 s orbit is not surprising since circularization is not expected to occur until a later evolutionary phase , when the stars have expanded to nearly fill their roche lobes .",
    "final reality checks on our results can be obtained from the disentangled spectra of the primary and secondary components of the hv  982 system , discussed in  3.1 .",
    "first , and most simply , the spectra of these stars are completely consistent with the parameters ( particularly @xmath80 and @xmath31 ) derived in our analysis , as is well - illustrated in figure [ figsecon ] .",
    "second , the values of @xmath121 ( see table [ tabstar ] ) also provide a remarkable confirmation of our results .",
    "these were derived by fitting the disentangled spectra with a grid of synthetic spectra computed with @xmath121 values ranging from 20 to 160 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainties in the best - fitting values of @xmath34 were estimated from the scatter in the results when small sections of the 40005000  disentangled spectra were considered individually .",
    "these measured @xmath121 values can be compared with theoretical expectations since the hv  982 stars are expected to have undergone `` pseudo - synchronization , '' in which the stellar rotational speeds are determined by the orbital angular velocity at periastron and the individual stellar radii . for a binary such as hv  982",
    ", pseudo - synchronization should occur in only @xmath122 myr ( using the recipe of claret , gimnez , & cunha 1995 ) , much less than the age of the system .",
    "the pseudo - synchronized values of @xmath34 for the primary and secondary stars are 89.5 km s@xmath13 and 97.7 km s@xmath13 , respectively ( as computed from the results in kopal 1978 ) , in excellent agreement with the measurements .",
    "our analysis has shown that hv  982 is an extraordinarily well - characterized system consisting of a pair of normal , mildly - evolved , early - b stars .",
    "the results are all internally consistent and consistent with a host of external reality checks , such as the expected lmc metallicity , @xmath123 calibrations of galactic b stars , stellar evolution calculations , and binary evolution calculations .",
    "this detailed characterization and the unremarkable nature of the hv  982 stars make this system ideal for the determination of a precise distance .    as in paper",
    "i , we derive the distance to the system simply by combining results from the eb analysis  which yields the absolute radius of the primary star @xmath124  and from the spectrophotometry analysis  which yields the distance attenuation factor @xmath59 .",
    "the result , shown in table [ tabstar ] , is @xmath125 kpc corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath126 .",
    "the uncertainty in the hv  982 distance determination arises from three independent sources : ( 1 ) the internal measurement errors in @xmath127 and @xmath128 given in table [ tabparms ] ; ( 2 ) uncertainty in the appropriate value of the extinction parameter @xmath61 ; and ( 3 ) uncertainty in the fos flux scale zeropoint due to calibration errors and instrument stability .",
    "straightforward propagation of errors shows that these three factors yield individual uncertainties of @xmath129 kpc , @xmath130 kpc ( assuming @xmath131 ) , and @xmath132 kpc ( assuming @xmath133% ) , respectively . the overall 1@xmath73 uncertainty quoted above is the quadratic sum of these three errors .",
    "note that the only `` adjustable '' factor in the analysis is the extinction parameter @xmath61 , for which we have assumed the value 3.1 .",
    "the weak dependence of our result on this parameter is given by : @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "as noted in  1 , there is a `` mini - controversy '' over the distance to hv  2274 , the lmc eb system we analyzed in paper i. close examination of the results from the various groups involved ( including our own early result for hv  2274 reported by guinan et al .",
    "1998b ) , reveals that the discord among the various results arises from the inclusion of ground - based optical photometry in the energy distribution portion of the analysis .",
    "the problem is twofold : first , there are significant differences among the available _ ubv _ measurements for hv  2274  differences larger than the claimed errors ( see table 2 of nelson et al .",
    "second , there is no obvious or objective way to determine how the various optical photometric indices should be weighted in the sed analysis with respect to the spectrophotometry .    the need to incorporate ground - based photometry in the hv",
    "2274 analysis is clear : @xmath85 can not be determined reliably unless the energy distribution data extend through the @xmath15 spectral region ( see the discussion at the end of  3.3.3 ) and the available fos spectrophotometry for hv  2274 truncate in the @xmath45 region at 4790  .",
    "the complications arise in determining which data to use and how to use them .",
    "since paper i , we have studied extensively the effects of optical photometry on the sed analysis and have concluded that the best way to analyze datasets such as that for hv  2274 is also the simplest way , namely , utilize the fos spectrophotometry and only the @xmath15 magnitude and force the best - fitting model to agree exactly with @xmath15 .",
    "the benefits of this are that it eliminates the need to determine weighing factors for the optical photometry and , importantly , allows the effect of the adopted @xmath15 magnitude on the resulting distance estimate to be examined explicitly .",
    "the exclusion of @xmath135 and @xmath136 from the analysis is not a loss since , even in the best of circumstances ( i.e , no observational errors ) , they are wholly redundant .    we have re - run the energy distribution portion of the hv  2274 analysis using only the fos data described in paper i and a value of @xmath137 ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ; watson et al . 1992 ) , which we believe to be well - determined .",
    "the fos data processing and the fitting procedure was applied exactly as described here for hv  982 , with the addition of the @xmath15 magnitude constraint .",
    "synthetic @xmath15 photometry was performed on the models as described by fm99 .",
    "the parameters determined in the analysis are the same as for hv  982 , namely , @xmath63 , [ m / h]@xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath59 , @xmath54 , and six @xmath58 parameters . before fitting the energy distribution",
    ", we corrected the hv  2274 fos spectrum for presence of a strong interstellar h i ly@xmath66 feature . from fitting the broad line profile ( using the same technique as described in  4 above for hv  982 )",
    ", we find a lmc h i absorption column density of @xmath138 towards hv  2274 .",
    "the lmc h  i 21-cm emission column density in this same direction is @xmath139 ( rohlfs et al .",
    ".    the results of this reanalysis are actually nearly identical to those reported in paper i and none of the conclusions in paper i or ribas et al .",
    "( 2000a ) regarding the stellar properties of hv  2274 and their consistency with stellar evolution theory are altered .",
    "this agreement  in hindsight  is not surprising since in paper i we gave high weight to the @xmath15 magnitude of udalski et al .",
    "1998 and low weights to the @xmath140 and @xmath45 data due to conflicting observational reports .",
    "we thus , by accident , approached what we now believe is the optimal way to combine the fos and photometric datasets .",
    "the distance derived for hv  2274 from the radius of the primary star ( @xmath141 r@xmath142 ) and the parameter @xmath143 is @xmath144 kpc corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath145 .",
    "this distance is slightly larger than the value 46.8 kpc reported in paper i. the error analysis incorporated ( 1 ) the internal uncertainties in @xmath124 and @xmath59 , ( 2 ) an uncertainty of @xmath146 in the adopted value of @xmath62 , ( 3 ) an uncertainty of @xmath147% in the fos flux scale , and ( 4 ) an uncertainty of @xmath148 in @xmath15 .",
    "these are all independent effects and were combined quadratically to yield the quoted 1@xmath73 error in @xmath149 and @xmath150 . this result is larger than the error of @xmath151 kpc quoted in paper i , due to the more realistic treatment given to the effects of uncertainty in @xmath15 .    as in the case of hv",
    "982 , the only `` adjustable '' parameter in this result is the assumed value @xmath62 . its influence , and the explicit effect of the @xmath15 magnitude , on the result can be expressed as : @xmath152 + 3.2 \\times [ v-14.16]$ ] .",
    "note that @xmath85 is not an adjustable parameter  its value ( 0.12 mag ) is fully determined by the analysis .",
    "the hv  2274 distance is more sensitive to the uncertainty in @xmath61 than for hv  982 because of hv  2274 s larger reddening .",
    "determining the distance to the lmc from the individual distances to hv  982 and hv  2274 requires correcting for the spatial orientation of the lmc s disk and the stars apparent locations within it .",
    "we adopt as a reference point the optical center of the lmc s bar , at ( @xmath66 , @xmath26)@xmath153 = ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) according to isserstedt ( 1975 ) , assume a disk inclination of @xmath156 , and a line - of - nodes position angle of @xmath157 ( schmidt - kaler & gochermann 1992 ) .",
    "figure [ figlmc ] shows a photo of the lmc with the adopted center and the orientation of the line - of - nodes indicated by the open box and solid line , respectively .",
    "the `` near - side '' of the lmc is eastward of the line - of - nodes .",
    "the hv  982 system is located , in projection , relatively close to the line - of - nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ figlmc ] ) and , given its measured distance , should  _ if it lies in the lmc s disk _  be positioned about 450 pc in front of the bar center .",
    "this would imply a distance to the lmc bar center of 50.7 ( @xmath158 ) kpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of 18.52 ( @xmath159 ) mag .",
    "as discussed in paper i , hv  2274 s location ( on the `` far - side '' of the lmc ; see fig .",
    "[ figlmc ] ) places it  _ if it lies in the lmc s disk _  about 1100 pc beyond the bar center .",
    "this result implies a distance to the bar center of 45.9 ( @xmath160 ) kpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of 18.31 ( @xmath161 ) mag .",
    "these two estimates of the distance to the lmc bar differ by nearly 5 kpc .",
    "( the magnitude of the discrepancy depends somewhat on the adopted orientation of the lmc disk ; however , this effect is only at the level of a few hundred pc given the various estimates for the lmc s geometry ; see westerlund 1997 , page 30 . )",
    "if the uncertainties in the two results were uncorrelated , then this would amount to a @xmath02@xmath73 difference .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the two results are not completely uncorrelated .",
    "for example , errors in the fos flux zeropoint would affect both analyses in the same way , as ( probably ) would errors in the adopted value of @xmath61 due to the similar lines of sight through the milky way halo .",
    "in addition , the stars in the hv  982 and hv  2274 systems bear close resemblance to each other .",
    "any small systematic effects in the analyses would affect both results in a similar way . as a result ,",
    "the discrepancy between the two measurements of the lmc distance is likely to be somewhat larger than the formal @xmath02@xmath73 .",
    "if these results represent marginally consistent , independent measures of the same quantity ( _ the _ lmc distance ) then they imply a mean distance of between 46 and 51 kpc .",
    "( including the eros  1044 result noted below , that mean is @xmath048 kpc ) .",
    "an alternate interpretation , however , is that the hv  982 and hv  2274 results are discrepant because the systems do not lie in a common disk ( with the orientation usually ascribed to the lmc ) , and therefore do not both constrain the distance to this disk . in this scenario ,",
    "hv  2274 is associated with the disk  as indicated by the comparison of h  i emission and absorption column densities in its direction ( i.e. , it lies behind @xmath162 of the h i in its direction )  and hv  982 is located several kpc behind the disk  consistent with it s lying behind all the h  i in its direction ( see  4 ) .",
    "this scenario would indicate a significant depth to the massive star distribution of the lmc and would have implications for the value of the lmc as a calibrator of the cosmic distance scale .",
    "the results for hv  982 and hv  2274 , by themselves , do not persuasively argue for the existence of a `` thick '' lmc .",
    "some support for this hypothesis is available , however , from other data . specifically : 1 ) the agreement between hv  982 s distance and that of the nearby sn  1987a ( @xmath163 kpc , panagia 1999 ) ; 2 ) the agreement between the hv  2274 result and that for the eb system eros  1044 ( ribas et al . 2001 ) which is also located in the lmc s bar and implies a lmc center distance of @xmath164 kpc ; and 3 ) the discrepancy between red clump distance estimates for the 30 doradus region ( @xmath165 kpc ; romaniello et al .",
    "2000 ) and the lmc bar ( @xmath166 kpc ; udalski 2000 ) . in general ,",
    "the existence of significant line - of - sight structure in the lmc would not be surprising , given its history of gravitational interaction with the milky way ( e.g. , weinberg 2000 ) , although this hypothesis may be difficult to reconcile with some observational indications of strong regularity within the system ( see , e.g. , the h  i synthesis maps of kim et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "clearly , additional results are needed to determine the extent of line - of - sight structure in the lmc and to derive a best estimate of the distance to the system .",

    "<S> we have determined the distance to a second eclipsing binary system ( eb ) in the large magellanic cloud , hv  982 ( @xmath0b1 iv - v + @xmath0b1 iv - v ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the distance  among other properties of the system  is based on optical photometry and spectroscopy and space - based uv / optical spectrophotometry . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis combines the `` classical '' eb study of light and radial velocity curves , which yields the stellar masses and radii , with a new analysis of the observed energy distribution , which yields the effective temperature , metallicity , and reddening of the system plus the distance `` attenuation factor '' , essentially @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> combining the results gives the distance to hv  982 , which is @xmath2 kpc .    </S>",
    "<S> this distance determination consists of a detailed study of well - understood objects ( b stars ) in a well - understood evolutionary phase ( core h burning ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are entirely consistent with  but do not depend on  stellar evolution calculations . </S>",
    "<S> there are no `` zeropoint '' uncertainties as , for example , with the use of cepheid variables . </S>",
    "<S> neither is the result subject to sampling biases , as may affect techniques which utilize whole stellar populations , such as red giant branch stars . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the analysis is insensitive to stellar metallicity ( although the metallicity of the stars is explicitly determined ) and the effects of interstellar extinction are determined for each object studied .    after correcting for the location of hv  982 , we find an implied distance to the optical center of the lmc s bar of @xmath3 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this result differs by nearly 5 kpc from our earlier result for the eb hv  2274 , which implies a bar distance of 45.9 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> these results may reflect either marginally compatible measures of a unique lmc distance or , alternatively , suggest a significant depth to the stellar distribution in the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> some evidence for this latter hypothesis is discussed . </S>"
