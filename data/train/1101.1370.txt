    "doped rare - earth manganites a@xmath0ae@xmath1bo@xmath2 ( a = rare - earth , ae = alkaline earth , b = mn ) are transition metal oxides where there is an intricate interplay of charge , orbital , spin and phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "no less important , however , is the role of disorder , which has dramatic effects upon the charge ordering , magnetic transition , etc  @xcite . while many different types of disorder has been discussed in the context of manganites ( eg . a - site disorder , b - site disorder etc . )  @xcite , in this paper we will introduce a novel kind of disorder apparently present in manganites but not widely talked about , and demonstrate its effects using the two - fluid ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) model hamiltonian  @xcite which was proposed earlier for manganites .",
    "the basic physics of manganites involve a coexistence of fast moving band electrons , and self - trapped jt polarons , interacting by coulomb interaction , and strongly coupled to a background of core spins .",
    "the ` @xmath3-@xmath4 ' model is an effective low energy hamiltonian which implicitly captures the crucial effects of these interactions and the quantum dynamics of the jt phonons .",
    "it invokes two types of @xmath5 electrons , one _ polaronic _ and _ localized _ ( @xmath3 ) , and the other _ band - like _ and _ mobile _ ( @xmath4 ) , and is given by ,    @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 the _ polaronically trapped _",
    "` @xmath3 ' species has site energy @xmath9 ( @xmath10 0.5 @xmath11 ) , and an exponentially reduced hopping ( @xmath10 1 @xmath12 ) which has been neglected , while the _ non - polaronic _",
    "` @xmath4 ' species ( site energy @xmath13 ) has undiminished hopping @xmath14 0.2 @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath15 ( @xmath10 5 @xmath16 ) is the effective on - site coulomb repulsion between the ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath4 ' species and @xmath17 the aforementioned hund s coupling .",
    "@xmath18 is a novel ferromagnetic _ virtual double - exchange _ coupling ( @xmath19 ) between the core spins , which arises from _ virtual , fast ( adiabatic ) _ hopping processes of the ` @xmath3 ' electrons to neighboring sites and back , leaving the local lattice distortion unrelaxed  @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential , @xmath20 , imposes the doping determined filling constraint : @xmath21 . at t=0 , in the fully polarized ferromagnetic phase",
    ", it reduces to a form very similar to the falicov - kimball model  @xcite .",
    "while disorder is commonly grouped into ` annealed ' and ` quenched ' , we make a further distinction in the context of this @xmath22 model for manganites , namely : _",
    "intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic_. we note that from the basic premises of the @xmath22 hamiltonian , the @xmath3 electrons are polaronically trapped at specific lattice sites , and have no quantum dynamics .",
    "they however , equilibriate according to classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the mobile @xmath4 electrons hop in the background provided by these static @xmath3 polarons .",
    "hence , the @xmath3 species represents an annealed disordered background to the mobile @xmath4 species .",
    "we refer to this disorder as ` intrinsic ' , since it is ` self - generated ' by the system under appropriate conditions .",
    "on the other hand , disorder due to doping at the a - site by alkaline earth atoms , or doping at the b - site by aluminium , chromium etc . ,",
    "is referred to as ` extrinsic ' .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 electrons face two kinds of disorder of the compositional type : namely _ intrinsic , annealed _ disorder due to the @xmath3 polarons  @xcite , and _ extrinsic , quenched _ disorder due to foreign dopant atoms .",
    "the effects of quenched disorder of the extrinsic type has already been considered in some detail in the literature , both at the abstract level  @xcite , and in the specific context of manganites  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the effects of this novel , intrinsic disorder in the context of the @xmath22 hamiltonian for manganites .",
    "the @xmath22 model has been studied using dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) in ref  @xcite , which is exact in the limit of large dimensions . due to the specific symmetries of the @xmath22 model , discussed in ref  @xcite ,",
    "it becomes exactly solvable in this limit , enabling a complete study of the phase diagram .",
    "however , dmft , like its counterpart cpa ( coherent potential approximation ) , does not include effects of anderson localization which is a crucial effect of disorder at low temperatures , and which we want to focus on in this paper .",
    "the reason for this is discussed in more detail below .",
    "hence , in this paper , we study the @xmath22 model using an approach pioneered by vollhardt and economou _ et al _ which can take us beyond the dmft approximation .",
    "we also compare our results with studies of inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) done using a direct numerical simulation .",
    "in the @xmath22 hamiltonian , the mobile @xmath4 electrons move in an annealed disordered background of site - trapped @xmath3 polarons . the dmft approximation can be used to study the electronic and transport properties of this hamiltonian .",
    "we first solve the dmft exactly using semicircular dos , and in the limit @xmath23  @xcite , in the fully spin - polarised ferromagnetic phase at t=0  @xcite .",
    "the dmft approximation reduces the complicated many - site problem given by eqn  [ lbham ] into an effective single - site problem , represented by the action : @xmath24\\ ] ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fractional occupancy of @xmath3-electrons at the dmft site , and @xmath27 is the weiss or bath green s function . solving this single site ` impurity ' problem",
    ", we obtain the full impurity green s function @xmath28 .",
    "since this action is similar to that for the falicov kimball model  @xcite , hence it can be solved exactly .",
    "we can also obtain the exact self - energy for the b - electrons using the dyson s equation : @xmath29 this expression is given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the probability of there being no @xmath3-polaron on the impurity site of the dmft , to be determined self - consistently . for low dopings , @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the half - bandwidth of the bare semicircular dos .",
    "the optical conductivity of a thermodynamic system can be obtained within linear response , using the kubo formula : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the well - known current - current correlation function . in the dmft limit of large dimensions , only the elementary particle - hole drude bubble for this correlation function survives , while all higher terms involving the irreducible vertex become negligible  @xcite . the contribution to the optical conductivity for a hypercubic lattice",
    "then becomes  @xcite : @xmath37",
    "the dmft approximation does not capture the physics of _ anderson localization _ , which may well be important for the low temperature transport behaviour of manganites having both intrinsic and extrinsic disorder .",
    "in particular , the metal insulator transition ( mit ) as a function of doping at low temperature is expected to be strongly influenced by localization physics . to investigate this aspect ,",
    "we go beyond dmft and study the mobility edge behaviour as a function of doping using the _ self - consistent theory of localization _ ( sts ) developed by vollhardt _ et .",
    "had proposed a particularly simple , and practically useful prescription for finding the mobility edge by mapping the sts equations formally to equations for bound state formation in a potential well  @xcite .",
    "we use economou s approach in this paper , which we refer to hereafter as _ potential well analogy _ ( pwa ) .",
    "we first find the single particle green s function for the @xmath4-electrons , as well as the self - energy , using the dmft approximation at zero temperature .",
    "the dc conductivity of the system is also found within the dmft approach .",
    "then we plug these quantities into the pwa equations to obtain the mobility edge at any particular doping .    in order to incorporate localization physics",
    ", one has to add correction terms to the drude conductivity , obtained from ` maximally crossed ' diagrams in the theory of weak localization  @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the drude conductivity , @xmath40 is the elastic mean free path , while @xmath41 is the inelastic mean free path . using the einstein relation between conductivity and diffusivity ,",
    "@xmath42 one can rewrite eq  [ loc_corr_sigma ] purely in terms of diffusivites .",
    "now , the theory was made self - consistent by vollhardt and wolfle @xcite by replacing @xmath43 by the full @xmath44 on the denominator of the integrand .",
    "@xmath45    the localization length @xmath46 was found by identifying @xmath47 in the insulating regime .",
    "economou and soukoulis @xcite pointed out that this equation has the same formal structure as the equation which determines the decay length of a bound state in a potential well .",
    "@xmath48    where @xmath49 is the volume of the primitive unit cell , @xmath50 is the inverse decay length of the bound state , while @xmath51 is the well depth , and @xmath52 is the effective mass near the band bottom .    for the case of tight binding on a hypercubic lattice",
    ", one particular site has the well potential @xmath53 .",
    "since the integral is over the brillouin zone , one establishes a connection between the lattice constant @xmath54 and the mean free path @xmath40 , neglecting @xmath55 at low @xmath56 .",
    "now , knowing the minimum depth of the potential well necessary for the appearance of a bound state@xcite , one can estimate the mobility edge .",
    "the mean free path @xmath57 is found as usual : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined as the average speed of bloch waves over the surface of constant energy @xmath60 .",
    "the drude conductivity @xmath61 can be found either in its full glory from eq  [ conduct_dmft ] or using the weak scattering approximation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the area of the surface of constant energy .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , the @xmath22 model shows a transition from ferromagnetic insulator to ferromagnetic metal , as the doping is increased , just as observed in real manganites .",
    "this is because of depletion in the number of trapped jahn - teller polarons , and correponding decrease in scattering and increase in paths available for hopping , upon hole - doping . within dmft , for @xmath64 , the critical doping for this insulator - metal transition ( imt )",
    "can be obtained analytically as @xmath65 which corresponds to the doping where the bottom edge of the @xmath4-band hits the sharp level at energy @xmath66 correponding to jahn - teller trapped @xmath3-polarons . since for @xmath64 the dmft @xmath4-electron dos is proportional to the imaginary part of the bath green s function mentioned above , they have the same bandwidth @xmath67 , as is evident from eq  [ bath_greens_func ] . hence ,",
    "when the @xmath4-band bottom hits the polaronic level , @xmath68 , giving the relation eq  [ x_crit_dmft ] above . for @xmath69 , the entire @xmath70 fraction of electrons",
    "were polaronically trapped in the local @xmath66 level , giving a polaronic insulator . for @xmath71 , the @xmath4-band states are available for the electrons to delocalize , which according to dmft , should immediately lead to a metallic state .",
    "we would like to improve upon this picture in this paper by bringing in the effect of anderson localization .",
    "we calculate the relaxation time @xmath72 , mean free path @xmath73 and transport dos @xmath74 for a cubic lattice and a single - orbital , tightbinding band .",
    "the dmft parameters are chosen so that the bottom edge of the @xmath4-band hits the sharp @xmath3-level at a doping ( @xmath75 ) of about @xmath76 . on account of the exact analytic relation",
    "mentioned above , this is accomplished by choosing , _",
    "eg_. , @xmath66 to be @xmath77 in units of hopping .",
    "this is because , for a cubic lattice , the half bandwidth is @xmath78 , which we identify with the half - bandwidth @xmath34 of the semicircular dos mentioned above .",
    "thus @xmath79 in units of hopping @xmath80 .",
    "the mobility edges are calculated both using the full conductivity , and the weak - scattering assumption as in eq  [ weakscat_mobedge_crit ] .",
    "the mobility edge trajectories obtained by both methods are plotted as a function of the doping in fig  [ fig : mob_edge_dmft_sts ] .",
    "one finds that for either method , there are two mobility edges occuring symmetrically about the centre of the band , between which lie the extended states .",
    "states lying between any one mobility edge and the band edge on the same side are localized , since it is the band tails which get localized first . for low doping values below @xmath75 , all states in the band",
    "are localized , and both the mobility edges are coincident at the band centre . as the doping increases , both the mobility edges proceed outwards from the band centre .",
    "simultaneously , the bandwidth also increases ( roughly as @xmath81 for low doping values ) , due to reduced scattering from polarons .",
    "the rate at which the mobility edges move apart in energy with increasing doping is greater than the rate at which the bandwidth increases , so that ultimately , the mobility edges meet the corresponding band edges at a large enough doping ( @xmath82 for this parameter set ) .",
    "this means that beyond this doping value all states in the band are extended .",
    "this makes sense , because nearabout this large doping , there are no more @xmath3-polarons left ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath4-electrons do not encounter any scattering , and the bandwidth is at its maximum .",
    "it is to be noticed that the mobility edge trajectories calculated by the two methods differ significantly only for small doping , while they coincide for large doping .",
    "this is to be expected , since for smaller doping values , there are a substantial number of polaron scatterers , so that the weak - scattering assumption is not justified .",
    "we have also plotted the self - consistently determined value of chemical potential from the dmft , on the same graph .",
    "it is found that even though the @xmath4-band states begin to become occupied for @xmath84 , but for a range of x thereafter , the occupied states are localized .",
    "the chemical potential proceeds towards the band centre , and meets the lower mobility edge at a doping @xmath85 of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "hence , for intermediate values of doping @xmath87 , the system is an _ anderson insulator _ , although dmft predicts that it should be metallic .",
    "we now compare this result , obtained using effective field theories , with a more realistic , real space , finite - size simulation of the @xmath22 model ( in the fully polarised ferromagnetic phase at t=0 ) , done by v. shenoy _ et.al",
    ". _  @xcite .",
    "details of this simulation will be found in ref  @xcite . in this simulation ,",
    "in addition to the hamiltonian described before , there is a long range coulomb interaction between charges .",
    "this long - range coulomb interaction ( treated using hartree - fock approximation ) prevents phase separation , and bring about a somewhat ` homogeneous ' mixture of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as is assumed in dmft .",
    "the presence of this long range coulomb interaction , along with the compensating negative charge for the dopant atoms , gives an additional source of disorder that was not included in the effective medium calculations .",
    "however , this disorder is correlated , as compared to the uncorrelated disorder due to the @xmath3-polarons .",
    "one finds that this additional correlated disorder seems to make very little difference from dmft results with regard to the ` critical ' doping required for electrons to start occupying band states .",
    "this is observed in fig  [ fig : ejt_x_shenoy ] , where the phase boundary for @xmath4-state occupancy nearly coincides with the dmft parabola given by eq  [ x_crit_dmft ] .",
    "we refer to this ` critical ' value of doping as @xmath88 .",
    "one finds that this @xmath89 .",
    "however , in this real space simulation , even after @xmath4-band states begin to get occupied , the hole clumps within which @xmath4-electrons are allowed to hop ( for on - site @xmath90 ) may not be percolating .",
    "we call the ` critical ' doping for this percolation threshold as @xmath91 , and this is higher than @xmath88 . moreover , even within these percolating clumps , some of the @xmath4-electron states may be anderson localized .",
    "to check the character of these band states , we find the _ inverse participation ratio _ ( ipr ) , defined as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the amplitude of the state at the i - th site . for an extended state , @xmath93 goes as @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for large n. but for a state localized at the j - th site , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . hence",
    ", ipr gives a good criterion for distinguishing extended states from localized ones .    since different realizations of the compensating dopant charge distribution give different set of states , one gets a distribution of ipr within each small energy range inside the band .",
    "hence , we discretize the band into energy intervals , and find the probability distribution for ipr within each such interval , by plotting histograms and corresponding frequency polygons , as discussed in detail in ref  @xcite .",
    "one finds from fig  [ fig : mob_edge_rsns ] that the mobility edge trajectories once again proceed away from the band centre , and towards the edges as doping increases .",
    "moreover , the chemical potential , determined from the band - filling in the same simulation , lies between the lower band edge and the lower mobility edge for small doping .",
    "hence , this simulation also predicts the existence of an anderson insulator phase for a certain region of doping .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath99 obtained from fig  [ fig : mob_edge_rsns ] , also agrees closely with the effective field theory calculations described before .",
    "thus , for @xmath100 , the @xmath101 , @xmath102 , while @xmath99  @xcite .    we have also calculated the localization length @xmath46 as a function of doping using the paw formalism .",
    "it turns out to be surprisingly small near @xmath75 : namely of the order of a lattice spacing , even less for lower doping values .",
    "as one approaches @xmath85 , @xmath46 at fermi energy diverges , as expected .",
    "@xmath46 for states at the center of the band diverge for lesser @xmath103 , since the mobility edge trajectories converge to the center at around @xmath104 .",
    "variable range hopping is therefore expected to be observed in the anderson insulator regime from @xmath75 to @xmath85 .",
    "the resistivity is therefore expected to go as  @xcite @xmath105 , where the temperature parameter @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 , @xmath108 being the inverse localization length . from our calculation of localization length , we estimate this parameter to lie between @xmath109 in this doping regime .    in conclusion",
    ", we have extended the dmft calculations for the imt within the two - fluid model  @xcite for manganites to incorporate localization effects .",
    "we find the existence of a prominent anderson insulator phase in addition to the polaronic , percolative insulator phases seen before .",
    "such an anderson insulator phase may well explain the observations of variable range hopping ( vrh )  @xcite in manganites reported by experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "the exceptionally small @xmath46 in the anderson insulating regime should translate to a large value for the temperature parameter for the vrh , as suggested by these studies . in the real space simulations by shenoy",
    "_  @xcite , there exists a coulomb glass phase with a soft coulomb gap at low doping values prior to the occupancy of the @xmath4-band states .",
    "this is due to the site - trapped @xmath3 polarons , which also interact with each other by coulomb interaction .",
    "this should give rise to a shklovskii - efros ( se - vrh ) @xmath110 transport  @xcite , which in this scenario will crossover into the mott - vrh @xmath111 regime as the doping is increased , and the @xmath4-band states begin to get occupied , before the final insulator - metal transition .",
    "interestingly , both the se - vrh and mott - vrh regimes have been noticed and reported in the experimental literature  @xcite , and there exists considerable debate between which one is more applicable to manganites .",
    "this is partly because of the technical difficulty associated with distinguishing between various power - laws in the exponent by fitting the resistivity data within a limited range of temperature  @xcite .",
    "our calculation , together with the earlier ones by shenoy _",
    "et.al._ , on the other hand , postulate the existence of _ both _ the se - vrh and mott - vrh regimes at different values of doping within the phase diagram for manganites .",
