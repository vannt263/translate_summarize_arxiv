    "the interaction vertex for each event is reconstructed using pmt timing information .",
    "after fixing the vertex , the number of cherenkov rings and their directions are determined by a maximum - likelihood procedure . the particle identification  ( pid ) algorithm uses the charge pattern to classify each ring as a showering , electron - like particle  ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) or a non - showering , muon - like particle  ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) . for events with a single ring , charge information is used to refine the reconstructed vertex based on the pid result .",

    "it was inserted from the top of the tank through a calibration access port near the center of the detector s top wall .",
