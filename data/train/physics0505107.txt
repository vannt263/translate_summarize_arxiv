    "alice was sitting on a window seat beside her father inside the aircraft .",
    "the departure was getting delayed because of the bad weather .",
    "she was coming back to delhi with her parents after a two - week vacation with her grand parents .",
    "soon her final year in school will begin .",
    "her father is a professor of biophysics at a university in delhi and he had utilized the vacation to prepare his lecture notes for the next semester .",
    "alice picked up the note book from her father s tray table and started reading the following paragraph from the notes .",
    "`` three centuries ago marcello malpighi conjectured `` nature , in order to carry out the marvelous operations in animals and plants , has been pleased to construct their organized bodies with a very large number of machines , which are of necessity made up of extremely minute parts so shaped and situated , such as to form a marvelous organ , the composition of which are usually invisible to the naked eye , without the aid of the microscope . ''",
    "( as quoted by marco piccolino @xcite ) '' .",
    "alice had already learnt a lot about machines from her physics teacher in school .",
    "a machine is a device , having a unique purpose , that augments or replaces human or animal effort for the accomplishment of physical tasks .",
    "the operation of a machine may involve the transformation of chemical , thermal , electrical , or nuclear energy into mechanical energy or vice versa .",
    "all machines have an _ input _ , an _ output _ , and a _ transforming _ ( or , modifying ) and a _ transmitting _ device ( see fig.[fig - machine ] ) .",
    "a man - made complex macroscopic device is usually an assembly of simpler components , each of which is designed to achieve a specific function .",
    "for example , a hair dryer consists of a heater , a fan and a switch suitably connected by electric wires and assembled in a compact framework ; combined and coordinated operation of these components gives rise to the function of the hairdryer- blowing hot wind .",
    "alice continued with the next paragraph in her father s note book . ",
    "naturally , to understand how a machine works , one has to understand the structure and functions of its components .",
    "so , the belief in the role of organic machines in sustaining life led to intense anatomical investigations in the seventeenth century .",
    "curiously , the emphasis shifted from organic machines during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ; a critical analysis for plausible reasons has been carried out by piccolino @xcite . with the triumph of the molecular theory of matter in the beginning of the twentieth century , molecule became the prime object of investigation in chemistry as well as in biology .",
    "interestingly , as early as in 1906 , loeb ( as quoted in ref.@xcite ) referred to the cell as a `` chemical machine '' .",
    "alice could nt believe what she read .",
    "so , she asked her father , `` does a cell really function as a machine ? '' .",
    "her father replied , `` indeed , each of the cells in our body is like a ` factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines ' @xcite , each of which is made up of an enormously large number of molecular machines . just like macroscopic machines",
    ", these molecular machines also consist of ` highly coordinated moving parts ' @xcite .",
    "however , unlike man - made machines , these are products of nature s _ evolutionary design _ over billions of years and the mechanisms underlying their function are often very different from their macroscopic counterparts in spite of many superficial similarities .",
    "the typical sizes of the molecular machines in our body cells range from tens to a few _ nano - meters_. therefore , one of the biggest challenges of modern science is to determine the principles behind the _ design _ of these _ natural nano - machines _ and to understand their dynamics which help in elucidating the _ mechanisms _ of their functions in terms of the fundamental principles of physics '' .",
    "the aircraft now started running along the runway of the airport .",
    "alice s father said , ",
    "alice , if you do not have a lot of home work during the next weekend , i ll be glad to tell you some of the intellectual challenges posed by the unusual mechanisms of these nano - machines inside our cells , each of which is like a micron - sized factory .",
    "the aircraft lifted off the runway and was ascending .",
    "alice looked out of the window and saw the busy vehicular traffic on the streets below . at one corner of the city she saw the high chimneys of the factories ; that is the industrial area where her grandfather owned a small company that manufactured some chemicals .",
    "few other high structures that she could recognise were huge water tanks that supplied drinking water to the adjoining residential areas .",
    "several years ago she had seen one of the pumps which raised water up to those tanks from the water filtration plant below .",
    "alice recalled the days when she was still in her kindergarten and her grandmother used to narrate the stories of ramayana and mahabharat in the evening during the summer vacations .",
    "the story she liked the most was that of the underwater kingdom of the snakes .",
    "she was so tired that , even before she realized , she was fast asleep in her seat and started dreaming .",
    "alice found herself at the entrance of the underwater kingdom .",
    "it was entirely covered by an approximately spherical membraneous soft wall .",
    "a water molecule greeted alice with a smile : `` welcome alice ! enjoy a guided tour of our kingdom which you call `` cell '' .",
    "i m neera and i ll be your guide during the next ninety minutes of your guided tour of our kingdom '' .",
    "neera warned alice that the `` channel''-like passage of the entry gate was very narrow and alice would have to squeeze through it .",
    "the wall of the kingdom actually consisted of two layers and the space in between was densely populated by what looked like two - tailed fishes ; neera seemed to have a special dislike for these fishes .",
    "when alice asked the name of these unusual species of the fish , neera said they are called _",
    "lipids_. the peculiar feature of these lipids was that the ones at the outer layer had their heads facing water outside the kingdom and those in the inner layer had their heads staring inside the kingdom ; neera said that the two monolayers of the lipids always stay together forming a bilayer .",
    "the tails of these fishes looked rather slippery and smelt like soap .",
    "while alice was looking at the wall , spellbound by what she saw , neera had donned a special swimming suit , somewhat like the ones used by swimmers at the olympics .",
    "neera said , i ll have tough time swimming across that channel unless i put on this swim suit .",
    "just as they slipped in through the channel , alice found a net of ropes which resembled fishing nets .",
    "first she thought that these were perhaps intended to prevent the two - tailed fishes from entering the kingdom .",
    "but , immediately she realized her mistake ; she had never seen such a dual - purpose net .",
    "while taking off her swim suit , neera said that this special net is called _",
    "cytoskeleton_. the girdirs and cables together form a skeleton that gives strength to the architecture of the kingdom and , at the same time , also form the back bone of the transportation network of the kingdom @xcite .",
    "it was water everywhere inside the kingdom .",
    "but , unlike the freely flowing transparent water alice had always been familiar with , it was rather viscous and turbid because of the enormous crowd swimming all around .",
    "alice requested neera for a brief pause as she wanted to watch the busy transportation system for a while before proceeding to their next destination .",
    "alice found that the motors were not moving smoothly ; their jerky motion was similar to that of a person trying to move straight in a dust storm .",
    "the motors moving along the cables and struts had no wheels .",
    "they looked more like two - legged humans than the four - wheeled vehicles alice was familiar with .",
    "each carried a heavy bundle of cargo on their head and moved like porters .",
    "alice s father owned a toyota and her uncle had a ford .",
    "neera pointed at the motor passing by and said it was a _ kinesin_.",
    "another coming from the opposite direction was a _",
    "dynein_. neera said that these two brands are like trains of the rapid mass transit system that ran from the city centre to the peripheral suburbs .",
    "the kinesins transport cargoes from the city centre to the peripheral subarbs while the dyneins move in the exactly opposite direction .",
    "the stiff struts that form the tracks for these motors are called _",
    "microtubules_. the shuttle buses that carried the passengers in these sububrbs were mostly _ myosins _ and they moved on more flexible cables called _",
    "alice did not find a single petrol pump ( gas station ) anywhere in the city and asked neera how the motors were running without fuel .",
    "neera corrected her mistake ; the motors were consuming `` chemical fuels '' .",
    "each of the motors was utilizing the chemical energy released by a chemical reaction .",
    "the fuels , namely molecules of a compound called atp , were abundant everywhere and the motors were using the energy released by their hydrolysis to generate the mechanical energy required for their directed movement .",
    "alice was well aware of the environmental problems created by the emissions from the motor vehicles back at home .",
    "so , she asked neera how they disposed off the spent fuel .",
    "neera said that all of the spent fuel is recycled in their kingdom ; the spent fuel is recharged to manufacture fresh fuel .",
    "neera also added that some other machines in their kingdom directly use sunlight and , therefore , are very eco - friendly as no waste product is generated by those machines .",
    "moreover , another advantage of the machines running on light energy is that light can be switched on and off easily and rapidly .    as it was getting late ,",
    "alice resumed her sightseeing tour of the kingdom . soon",
    "alice and neera were at the pore - like entrance to the palace , called _ nucleus _ , at the center of the kingdom .",
    "alice was spellbound by the chemical factory inside the nucleus .",
    "a member of a special class of machines , called dna _ helicase _ , was walking along a dna fiber unwinding the two strands .",
    "this process resembled disentangling of two strands of fine thread that are snarled together .",
    "the local opening of the double stranded dna ( see fig.[fig - helimot ] ) is , effectively , an unzipping process that cuts the weak bonds which hold the two strands together .",
    "`` such openings form one step in the overall processes of dna repair or polymerisation of dna and proteins '' explained neera . rna _ polymerase_s",
    "( see fig.[fig - polymerase ] ) also move on dna and the main function of these machines is to polymerise the so - called messenger rna joining nucleotides that are selected on the basis of the templates formed by a single - strand of dna .",
    "the input energy for these machines comes from ntp condensation and the output is the work done by the machine against the opposing force .",
    "alice saw the synthesis of one such m - rna strand in front of her eyes in a matter of seconds .",
    "then , the serpentine m - rna headed towards the nuclear pore .",
    "neera said , `` after moving out of the nucleus , the m - rna will serve as a template for the synthesis of a protein by another set of machines '' .",
    "alice was excited and wanted to see the whole process .",
    "she rushed out of the nucleus behind the m - rna , closely followed by neera .",
    "alice saw that soon the m - rna got decorated by little ball - like machines .",
    "she looked at neera .",
    " those are the _ ribosomes _ , explained neera ( see fig.[fig - ribosome ] ) .",
    "alice saw a stiching - like action by each of the ribosomes , which also involved the m - rna , t - rna and amino acids , that , finally , gave birth to a fresh protein chain .",
    "however , almost instantaneously the nascent protein folded into a complex three - dimensional structure that neera identified as the _ tertiary _ structure of the protein",
    ".     codons , i.e. , @xmath1 triplets of nucleotides ( @xmath2 in this figure ) on the m - rna .",
    "the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 capture the effective rates of initiation and termination of translation .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    on the way back , alice saw many buildings of wide variety of shapes and sizes ; each of these was enclosed by a soft membranous wall .",
    "neera pointed her finger at one and said , `` can you see that labyrinthine structure ? that s _ endoplasmic reticulum_. and , of course , the small balls sticking to its membranous wall are the ribosomes . ''",
    "then neera turned in another direction ,  that one over there is called the _",
    "golgi apparatus_. alice could not control her curiosity .",
    "she asked , `` why do you need the golgi apparatus ? '' .",
    "neera was brief , `` the golgi apparatus is like a letter sorting station of a postal system ; the proteins are sorted here , packaged and forwarded to their onward destination . ''",
    "neera added further , `` we ll visit some endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus during your future visits and show you the functions of those . in particular , there are some _ translocation machines _ on and near their walls which pull and push proteins in and out of the building . without the help of these membrane - bound machines , no protein would be able to cross the walls of the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus '' ( see fig.[fig - trlocmot ] ) .",
    "suddenly , neera seemed very excited : `` alice , can you see that small sausage - shaped building over there ? that s a _ mitochondrion _ , one of the power houses that convert the spent fuel adp into fresh fuel atp .",
    "it looks very different from the chemical factories in your world .",
    "this is achieved by a tiny machine , called atp _ synthase _",
    "@xcite , stuck on the wall of the mitochondrion .",
    "perhaps you can not see it from here ( see fig.[fig - atpsynth ] ) .",
    "but , i can assure you that this rotary motor currently holds the world record : it is the smallest rotary motor .",
    "this is , at least superficially , very similar to the motor of a hair dryer '' .",
    " is this the only rotary motor that exists in this kingdom ?  , asked alice . ``",
    "bacteria also have a slightly larger rotary motor fixed on their skin @xcite .",
    "this motor rotates a helical filament called a flagellum '' ( see fig.[fig - flagmot ] ) .    on their way back",
    ", neera followed a shorter route and reached a gate different from the one through which they had entered .",
    "neera wanted to show alice a pump in action @xcite .",
    "it was fitted on the boundary wall .",
    "it was constantly pumping sodium ions from inside to outside while simultaneously , it was pumping potassium ions in the reverse direction .",
    "neera emphasized , `` the pump is continuously consuming energy to carry the ions against the concentration gradient , i.e. , opposite to the direction of the spontaneous flow , just as a water pump consumes electrical energy to draw water upward against gravity '' .",
    "alice and neera came out of the kingdom through another slippery channel close to the pump .",
    "neera said to alice , `` i hope you liked our kingdom and will visit us again '' .",
    "unfortunately , this kingdom of ours will not last long  .",
    "this came as a shock to alice , `` why will this cell perish ? ''",
    "neera consoled her , `` that s the rule in the world of cells ; each goes through a life cycle and ultimately ends with a split into two daughter cells .",
    "this one is no exception and it will split into two daughter kingdoms in a few days .",
    "i ll be your guide during your next tour inside one of those two daughter kingdoms . next time",
    "i ll also show you how cells use their machines to move from one place to another @xcite .",
    "some cells `` swim '' in their aqueous environment while others `` crawl '' ; the piston - like action of some internal machines play a crucial role in cell crawling '' .",
    "just as alice and neera were about to part ways , she saw a torpedo - shaped creature .",
    "it seemed as if it was looking for some way to sneak into the kingdom .",
    "it had a helical propeller attached to its skin that was rotating at an astonishingly high angular speed .",
    "neera stopped alice , `` beware ! that is a bacterium '' .",
    "alice immediately realized the rotating propeller must be the flagellum that neera had mentioned earlier .",
    "neera continued , `` this bacterium is trying to invade the kingdom '' .",
    "alice saw yet another object that looked like a mortar shell .",
    "`` oh my god , look at that virus '' , exclaimed neera in a shaky voice ,  this is another type of potential invader .",
    "if it succeeds , it will hijack our motors to get a free ride to the center of the town and then enter into the nucleus .",
    "if it can seize control of the machines involved in the protein synthesis , the future of the kingdom is doomed  .",
    "suddenly the virus spotted alice and , she thought , it was approaching her aggressively .",
    "alice shrieked in fear ... and her eyes opened .",
    "her mother put her palm on alice s head .",
    "`` what happened alice ? '' , she asked .",
    "`` nothing mom , i just saw something in my dream '' .",
    "there was an announcement , the aircraft was going to land soon in delhi .",
    "as anticipated , alice had very little home work during the next weekend .",
    "so she sat down with her father albert and her elder brother alex to hear the stories of molecular motors .",
    "alice : can you really see an individual molecular machine with the help of some equipment in your lab as clearly as i saw them in my dream ?",
    "+ albert : seeing is believing .",
    "however , you may be surprised to hear that until late in the twentieth century scientists could not see individual molecules although everybody believed in their existence .",
    "in fact , in those days , the existence of a molecule could only be inferred indirectly from some circumstantial evidences gathered from experiments on samples which used to be very large compared to single molecules .",
    "search for microscopes which would allow us to see this elusive object seemed like a `` holy grail '' .",
    "we got our first glimpse of the macromolecules via x - ray diffraction and , then , electron microscopy . +",
    "alice : are the basic underlying principles of electron microscopy different from those of optical microscopy ?",
    "+ albert : no .",
    "the basic principles of these two techniques are essentially similar .",
    "optical microscopy uses light waves whereas the wave nature of electron is utilized in electron microscopy .",
    "the main difference is that much higher spatial resolution is achievable by electron microscopy because of the smaller wavelength of the electrons .",
    "+ alex : why were scientists not satisfied even with the structures determined by electron microscopy ?",
    "+ albert : what one got from those probes were static pictures . towards the end of the twentieth - century a series of novel imaging techniques emerged which revolutionized optical microcopy . with the help of these tools we can now monitor the dynamics of single - molecules @xcite .",
    "confocal fluorescence microscopy is , perhaps , the most versatile among these methods .",
    "the confocal microscope focusses on the intended plane of a sample and filters out the light from all the other planes .",
    "alex : are these extraordinary developments in experimental techniques mainly responsible for the recent revolutions in cell biology ? + albert : yes , indeed .",
    "after all , invention of novel experimental techniques always lead to enormous progress in natural sciences .",
    "for example , inventions of the telescope , microscope , x - ray opened up new horizons . in order to understand the mechanisms of molecular machines we need experimental probes with sufficiently high _ spatial _ as well as _",
    "temporal _ resolutions that would be adequate to watch the dynamics of these machines .",
    "such high resolutions have been attained only in the last few years .",
    "+ alice : what are these new experimental rechniques for watching single molecules ?",
    "+ albert : the recently developed single - molecule techniques can be broadly classified into two groups : ( i ) methods of imaging , and ( ii ) methods of manipulation .",
    "for example , green ( and red ) fluorescence microscopy enables us to monitor the dynamics of single motors just as ecologists use `` radio collars '' to track individual animals .",
    "but , for a clear understanding of the mechanism of the molecular machines it is not enough merely to watch them passively ; we must also be able to manipulate them ( see fig.[fig - manipul ] ) .",
    "such manipulations have been possible over the last decade because of the availability of sophisticated techniques like , for example , optical tweezers and atomic force microscopes ( afm ) . + alice : is there any similarity between `` optical tweezer '' and the tweezer grandma uses for pulling out grandpa s grey hairs ?",
    "+ albert : although the two look very different , their functions are very similar . in optical tweezers , oppositely moving laser beams create an optical trap using the radiation pressure of the laser light ; this trap can grab a dielectric object which then can be manipulated just like what your grandma does with her tweezer .",
    "+ alex : what is the working principle of afm ?",
    "+ albert : the scanning force microscope ( sfm ) was originally designed to image a surface by scanning it with a sharp tip just like the finger tip of a human gives a fair picture of the macroscopic irregularities and the overall topography of a surface . in the afm",
    "the tip is replaced by a cantilever that can pull , for example , a motor protein .",
    "+ alice : i thought only biologists study whatever goes on inside a cell .",
    "i did nt know that physicists like you are also working on these phenomena .",
    "+ albert : that , indeed , was true till a couple of decades ago .",
    "but , now this is a frontier area of interdisciplinary research that involves molecular cell biology , ( bio-)chemistry , physics as well as engineering , especially , nano - technology @xcite .",
    "alice : what is nano - technology ?",
    "+ albert : technologies which suitably utilize structures and processes that occur at the nanometer scale are collectively referred to as `` nanotechnology '' . for developing nanotechnology",
    "it is not enough just to get a fundamental understanding of structures and dynamics of materials at nanometer scale but one requires techniques to manipulate matter on such short scales so that novel applications can be innovated .",
    "+ alex : is nano - technology a very recent development ?",
    "+ albert : although quest for ever - smaller size of devices began long ago , feynman s famous talk of 1959 @xcite is accepted by the majority of physicists as the defining moment of nano - technology .",
    "feynman first attracted the attention of the physics communiy to the unlimited possibilities of manipulating and controlling things on the scale of nano - meters .",
    "he indicated the potential advantages of nano - technology .",
    "he also speculated on the possible methods .",
    "nano - technology is the latest trend in the twenty - first century .",
    "+ suddenly albert s mobile phone started ringing ; it was a call from one of his colleagues who , like albert , switched to biological physics in the middle of his career a few years ago .",
    "the discussion resumed as soon as albert s telephonic conversation ended .",
    "+ alex : what is the main goal of physicists working in this area of research ?",
    "+ albert : physicists use several different methods of investigation , namely , experimental , theoretical and computational techniques , for discovering the common fundamental physical principles that govern the generic features of the structure and dynamics of biological nano - machines .",
    "they also investigate the corresponding underlying mechanisms of operations of specific machines .",
    "+ alex : i understand the term `` experimental method '' and you have already given some examples of those techniques .",
    "but , i do nt understand the term `` theoretical method '' .",
    "+ albert : by `` theoretical methods '' we mean analytical ( i.e. , mathematical ) treatment of theoretical models .",
    "since such an analysis can be accomplished exactly only in rare cases , one has to make sensible approximations so as to get quantitative results as accurately as possible . +",
    "alice : my biology teacher told us that the fruit fly _ drosophila _ is a `` model organism '' .",
    "is there any relation between the terms `` model organism '' and `` theoretical model '' ?",
    "+ albert : no . in biology , often the simplest among a family of organisms is called a model system for the purpose of experimental investigations .",
    "for example , the fruit fly _ drosophila _ and the worm _ c - elegans _ are often called model organisms because of their simpler features among all multi - cellular organisms . however",
    ", a theoretical model is an abstract representation of the real system .",
    "biologists often develop _ qualitative _ models to explain empirical observations .",
    "in contrast , physicists work mostly with _ quantitative _ models , formulated in terms of mathematical symbols , not only to interpret experimental data but also to make new predictions that can be tested through experiments .",
    "+ alex : would nt it be wise to develop an all encompassing single theoretical model that can explain all the intracellular phenomena ?",
    "+ albert : every theoretical model is intended to address a set of questions .",
    "the modeler must choose a _ level of description _ appropriate for this purpose keeping in mind the phenomena that are the subject of the investigation .",
    "otherwise , the model may have either too much redundant details or it may be too coarse to provide any useful insight .",
    "for example , a molecular model of a hair dryer will have too much redundant information .",
    "similarly , a continuum model of liquid water will be too coarse to study the dynamics of individual molecules of water . since physicists most often focus only on generic features of the various classes of machines , rather than specific features of individual members of these classes",
    ", they normally develop minimal models which may be regarded as _ mesoscopic _",
    ", rather than molecular , i.e. , their status is somewhere in between those of the macroscopic and molecular models .",
    "+ alex : so far as the computational methods are concerned , are these identical to those used , for example , in bioinformatics ?",
    "+ albert : computational biology has two distinct branches- + ( i ) * knowledge discovery * ( or , _ data mining _ ) which extracts hidden patterns or laws from huge quantities of experimental data , forming hypotheses .",
    "knowledge discovery is used extensively in bio - informatics .",
    "+ ( ii ) * simulation - based analysis * , which tests hypotheses with computer simulations , provides predictions that , at least in principle , can be tested by in - vitro and/or in - vivo experiments in the laboratory . the starting point of a computer simulation is to develop an _ algorithm _ , which can be implemented numerically , for calculating the desired quantities .",
    "the sequence of instructions to a computer specifying the numerical procedure of that algorithm constitutes a computer _",
    "program_. + alice : are computer simulations different from what my biology teacher once referred to as _ in - silico _ experiments ?",
    "+ albert : no , not at all .",
    "computer simulation is often referred to as `` computer experiments '' or , in analogy with in - vivo and in - vitro experiments , also called _ in - silico _ experiments because of the close analogies between laboratory experiments and computer simulation .",
    "laboratory experiments are performed on a sample of a material whereas computer simulation is an experiment with models .",
    "the computer program is the analogue of the experimentalist s apparatus , testing of a program with known and well understood models is the analogue of the calibration of the apparatus in laboratory .",
    "computation is the analogue of experimental measurement and , finally , both laborary experiments and computer experiments require data analysis . +",
    "alice : can we simulate any arbitrary molecular machine with a computer ?",
    "+ albert : no , there are practical limitations .",
    "the main difficulties faced in computer simulations arise from the limited size of the available computer memory and the limitations imposed by the available cpu time .",
    "+ alice s mother came into the room and placed the tea tray on the table .",
    "albert started sipping tea while alice s mother asked her , `` alice , are you getting satisfactory explanations of the things you saw in your dream ? '' .",
    "alice smiled .",
    "+ alex : since i have neither seen these machines in my dream nor observed them under the microscopes in your lab , could you please tell me what are the various types of molecular machines that operate inside an eukaryotic cell ?",
    "+ albert : first , we can group the machines into two categories- one - shot machines and cyclic machines .",
    "the one - shot machines convert one form of energy ( usually , chemical energy ) into another ( usually mechanical energy ) only once , often in a sudden burst .",
    "in contrast , the machines belonging to the other group work in cycles just like engines of our automobiles .",
    "the cyclic machines , in turn , can be classified into different categories- motors , pumps , etc .",
    "the motors can also be divided into two categories , namely , linear and rotary ; the linear motors move along filamentary tracks consuming fuel whereas rotary motors are like alice s hair dryer .",
    "+ alex : could you please give me examples of filamentary tracks used by the molecular motors ?",
    "+ albert : microtubules and flilamentary actin are most common tracks made of proteins .",
    "nucleic acids like , for example , single - stranded dna and mrna serve as tracks for polymerases and ribosomes , respectively ( see table [ tab - tracks ] for typical examples of motors and the corresponding tracks ) .",
    "+       alice was never interested in muscles .",
    "she was looking through the open window and saw their neighbour driving the car out of his garage in reverse gear .",
    "this triggered alice s curiosity .",
    "+ alice : is nt the mechanism of molecular machines very similar to those of their macroscopic counterparts ?",
    "+ albert : biomolecular machines operate in a domain where the appropriate units of length , time , force and energy are , _ nano - meter _ , _ milli - second _ , _ pico - newton _ and @xmath5 , respectively ( @xmath6 being the boltzamann constant ) . from a comparison of some of the characteristic features of the molecular motors and macroscopic motors ( see table [ tab - comp ] ) , naively , at first sight , one may think that the differences in the mechanisms of the molecular and macroscopic machines is merely a matter of two different scales ( of size , time , force , energy etc . ) .",
    "but , that is not true .",
    "since the masses of the molecular machines are extremely small , they are subjected to two dominating forces which are quite small for the macroscopic machines .",
    "+ alex : does it mean that the molecular machines are not governed by the newton s law that i have learnt in school ?",
    "albert : yes and no .",
    "the equation governing the motion of the machines is still newton s equation , namely , mass @xmath7 acceleration = force .",
    "but , there are crucial subtleties here .",
    "because of its tiny mass , the inertial forces are orders of magnitude smaller than the viscous forces it experiences in the aqueous medium ; in technical terms , one says that the dynamics of molecular motors is dominated by hydrodynamics at low reynold s number @xcite .",
    "+ alice : what is the reynold s number ?",
    "+ albert : the reynold s number @xmath8 is the ratio of the inertial and viscous forces .",
    "let us estimate @xmath8 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a characteristic linear size of the object , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the density and viscosity of the liquid and @xmath13 is the relative velocity of the object with respect to the liquid . for proteins in aqueous solution , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( corresponding to @xmath18 ) .",
    "consequently , the corresponding reynold s number is @xmath19 ( and even smaller for slower motions ) whereas when you swim in our swimming pool @xmath8 is of the order of @xmath20 . +",
    "alice : what difference does it make physically ?",
    "+ albert : in order to appreciate the difficulties of swimming at low reynold s number , let us multiply @xmath10 by a factor of @xmath21 , without altering @xmath11 and v , so that @xmath12 must be multiplied by @xmath21 to keep @xmath22 unaltered .",
    "in other words , if a motor tried to swim in an aqueous medium adopting the swimming styles of humans , the difficulties it would face will be very similar to those that you and i would face if we ever tried to swim in honey .",
    "interestingly , because of the low reynold s number , the nano - motors can come to a halt practically instantaneously as soon as they put on the brake .",
    "+ alex : is that the only difference between molecular and macroscopic machines ?",
    "+ albert : no .",
    "the molecular machines get bombarded from all sides by the randomly moving water molecules . because of these bombardments , the machines experience an additional force which is totally random .",
    "the masses of molecular machines are so small that these _ random thermal forces _ have a strong infuence on their movement .",
    "it is because of these random forces that the molecular motors inside the cell move in a manner that resembles the movement of a human being in a violent storm .",
    "alice : i do not have any feeling for the level of difficulty faced by the motors because of this storm - like situation .",
    "could you kindly give us some concrete idea ?",
    "+ albert : let me consider sensory neurons , i.e. , some special types of cells of your brain .",
    "if all the lengths are multiplied by @xmath23 , then the transport from the cell center to the cell periphery is comparable to transportation of cargoes , which are supplied by a chemical plant of @xmath24 meter diameter , for more than @xmath25 kilometers along an approximately cylindrical pipe whose diameter is no more than @xmath26 meters .",
    "this cargo transport is to be achieved even when the transport vehicles are getting bombarded from all sides by a violent storm ! +",
    "alice : what is meant by a `` random force '' ? + albert : well , even if you know the force acting on the machine at this instant of time , you have absolutely no idea of its magnitude and direction at any later time .",
    "+ alex : then , how does one integrate the newton s equation for the machine and find out its trajectory ?",
    "+ albert : very good question , alex .",
    "in fact , the machine does not have any unique trajectory for a given initial condition ; if you repeat the experiment , starting from identical initial conditions , the trajectories will be different from each other !",
    "in other words , the equation of motion for the molecular machine ( for simplicity , in one dimensional space ) is given by @xmath27 where the first term on the right hand side denotes the externally applied load force while the viscous drag force , captured through the second term on the right hand side , is assumed to be proportional to the velocity of the motor .",
    "the last term in this equation represents the random brownian force . +",
    "alex : do you mean to say that the molecular motor behaves as a brownian particle ?",
    "+ albert : yes , almost .",
    "however , unlike passive brownian particles ( like , for example , pollen grains in water ) , the molecular machines need ( free- ) energy input @xcite and , therefore , these are often regarded as `` active '' brownian particles .",
    "at least some of these machines are physical realizations of brownian ratchet , a device that exhibits directed , albeit noisy , movement in spite of being subjected to random brownian forces as they operate in conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "+ alex : is this relation with brownian motion and non - equilibrium processes motivating a growing number of statistical physicists like you to get into this area of research ?",
    "+ albert : these are certainly motivating many statistical physicists to work on biological machines .",
    "there are also other related motivating factors .",
    "the durable parts of macroscopic machines are normally `` hard '' so as to survive the regular wear and tear .",
    "in contrast , the structural elements of the cell , e.g. , filaments and membranes , are `` soft '' .",
    "these materials can be deformed easily because their conformations are determined by weak forces like , for example , van der waals forces , hydrogen bonding , etc .",
    "moreover , since the thermal energy @xmath5 available at a temperature @xmath28 is comparable to these weaker forces , thermal fluctuations can also lead to conformational changes . furthermore , straightening of a filament or flattening of a membrane reduces its entropy and the corresponding restoring force is of entropic origin .",
    "therefore , the free energies of soft matter are often dominated by entropy which gives rise to exotic phenomena that are not observed in hard materials .",
    "naturally , not only statistical physicists like me , but also physicists who have been working for many years on soft matter are also getting interested in soft bio - materials .",
    "+    the level of the discussion was now too high to be fully appreciated by alice .",
    "she was watching the neighbour cleaning his car .",
    "she was thinking about the rising prices of petrol and cooking gas about which her mother had been complaining a lot in the last few days .",
    "+ alice : i could not understand how atp molecules serve as fuels for molecular machines ?",
    "+ albert : atp is the energy currency of the cell and is composed of a sugar - base - phosphate combination found in nucleotides ; the sugar of this energy currency is ribose , the base is adenine .",
    "however , atp differs from rna because , unlike rna , it consists of more than one phosphate group .",
    "the adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) has higher energy than adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) and , the process whereby atp gets converted to adp and inorganic phosphate is called hydrolysis .",
    "the energy released by each atp molecule through this process is about @xmath29 j which corresponds to about @xmath30 at room temperature .",
    "the reverse energy consuming process , through which the spent fuel is recharged , is called phosphorylation . just as euro",
    "is used in many places as the international currency , instead of us dollar , some molecular machines use guanine triphosphate ( gtp ) , instead of atp , as the energy currency .",
    "+ alex : does the presence of the track affect the rate of hydrolysis of atp by the motor ? +           with the `` mechanical variable '' @xmath31 and chemical variable @xmath32 are shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] ( a )   with the `` mechanical variable '' @xmath31 and chemical variable @xmath32 are shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ] ( b )    alex : is this enhanced enzymatic activity of a motor in the presence of its track related to its walking ability along the track ?",
    "+ albert : in the presence of the filamentary track , the mechanical and chemical cycles of the motor get coupled .",
    "for example , in case of conventional myosin , a mechanical step ( the binding of the motor with the actin filament ) catalyzes a chemical step ( the release of phosphate ) and , then , a chemical step ( the binding of atp ) catalyzes a mechanical step ( the detachment of the motor from the actin filament ) .",
    "similarly , in case of conventional double - headed kinesin , a chemical step ( the binding of atp to head 1 ) catalyzes a mechanical step ( the attachment of the head 2 to the mt ) which , in turn , catalyzes a chemical step ( the release of adp from head 2 ) which , in turn , catalyzes a mechanical step ( the detachment of head 1 from the mt ) ( see , for example , howard 2001 ) .",
    "thus , at the most abstract level , the problem of a molecular machine can be formulated as that of _ mechano - chemistry _ @xcite . +",
    "alex : could you kindly give me some intuitive physical picture of the _ mechano - chemistry _ of molecular motors ?",
    "+ albert : suppose , the system is being described by @xmath33 , which represent the mechanical and chemical variables , respectively . the free energy @xmath34 can be represented by a landscape such that @xmath34 is the height ( or , depth ) of the landscape at the location @xmath35 .",
    "in this scenario , the diffusion current along the mechanical coordinate is the velocity of the motor in real space , whereas that along the chemical coordinate is a measure of the enzymatic turnover rate .",
    "thus , the landscape , i.e. , the free - energy surface determines the kinetic mechanism of the motor @xcite .",
    "+ alex : i guess the landscape shows periodicity along @xmath31 because the positions of the binding sites for the motor are arranged periodically on its track .",
    "am i right ?",
    "+ alex : yes , in case of cytoskeletal motors the perodicity of the mt and actin tracks give rise to periodicity of the landscape along @xmath31 for any arbitrary fixed value of @xmath32 . +",
    "alex : is the landscape periodic also in the @xmath32 direction ?",
    "+ albert : along @xmath32 , the free energy diagram looks exactly like a typical free energy diagram for a chemical reaction where the two minima corresponding to the reactants and products are separated by a free energy barrier . since the enzyme returns to its initial state after each enzymatic cycle , @xmath36 is periodic also in @xmath32 except for an additional term that accounts for the free energy released by the reaction .",
    "in other words , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the spatial period along @xmath31 ( i.e. , spacing between the successive binding sites on the track ) while @xmath39 is the periodicity in the chemical variable . +",
    "alice : is it possible to visualize on the free - energy landscape the typical route of a motor ? + albert : yes . in general , the landscape will have _ local minima _ connected by _ low - energy passes_. these passes together define a low - energy path .",
    "the projection of the path on the @xmath40 plane is neither parallel to @xmath31 nor parallel to @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , the tilt of the landscape in the chemical direction drives the mechanical movement of the motor utilizing the free energy released the by chemical reaction to do the necessary mechanical work .",
    "+ it was already lunch time and the family moved to the dining table .",
    "but the discussion continued .",
    "+ alex : what kind of fundamental questions are addressed in this area of interdisciplinary research ? + albert :",
    "well , some of the fundamental questions are as follows : + ( i ) what are the _ moving parts _ of the motor and what are their molecular constituents ? + ( ii ) what is the _ fuel _ that supplies the ( free-)energy input for the machine ? + ( iii ) how does the _ transduction _ of energy take place ? + ( iv ) what is the most appropriate definition of efficiency of the motor and how to estimate that efficiency ? + ( v )",
    "how is the operation of the machine _ regulated _ and _ controlled _ ?",
    "for example , how is the machine switched on and off ?",
    "+ in addition to these general questions , several other fundamental questions are addressed in the context of specific molecular machines .",
    "+ alice : is this research important from a biomedical perspective ? can the results of these investigations improve the quality of human life ? + albert : yes .",
    "first , it is not surprising that defective molecular machines can cause diseases @xcite just as occasional disruption of work in any department of a factory can bring the entire factory to a standstill .",
    "in fact , malfunctioning of the track and/or motor can cause breakdown of the intracellular molecular motor transport system .",
    "moreover , viruses are known to hijack the motors to travel from the cell periphery to the cell nucleus .",
    "therefore , if we understand how motors work at the molecular level we will not only be able to fix them when they malfunction but also control their progress and even find cures for the disease .",
    "for example , we might also devise ways to selectively either arrest sub - cellular processes that cause diseases like cancer or slow down metabolism of organisms that invade cells causing other types of disease .",
    "the molecular motors can be used as vehicles for drug delivery @xcite .",
    "thus , research on molecular machines can contribute towards improvement of human health and fitness .",
    "+ alice : i am so impressed by mother nature !",
    "i wish our factories were as sophisticated as the cell .",
    "+ albert : alice , you may be glad to know that a large number of experts working in the area of nano - technology are drawing lessons from the principles used by nature in designing the molecular motors with the aim of synthesizing artificial nano - machines @xcite .",
    "+ alex : are all the physicists and engineers following the same approach in nano - technology ?",
    "+ albert : no .",
    "the miniaturization of components for the fabrication of useful devices , which are essential for modern technology , is currently being pursued by engineers following mostly a top - down ( from larger to smaller ) approach .",
    "on the other hand , the natural molecular machines opened up a new frontier of nano - technology and provides an alternative approach- the bottom - up ( from smaller to larger ) approach @xcite .",
    "this approach is pursued mostly by chemists .",
    "feynman , a great visionary , made the prophetic statement in his famous talk at the american physical society @xcite : `` ultimately , we can do chemical synthesis ... the chemist does a mysterious thing when he wants to make a molecule .",
    "he .... mixes this and that , and he takes it , and he fiddles around . and",
    ", at the end of a difficult process , he usually does succeed in synthesizing what he wants '' .",
    "indeed , in recent years , several artificial molecular machines have been synthesized chemically @xcite . in order to get some lessons from nature s billion year experience in nano - technolgy",
    ", we must carry out reverse engineering . +",
    "alice : what is reverse engineering ?",
    "+ albert : reverse engineering is  the process of analyzing a system to identify the system s components and their interrelationships and create representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction @xcite . reverse engineering of natural nanomachines will give us clues as to the possible design principles that can be utilized to synthesize artificial nanomachines .",
    "in fact , the term biomimetics has become popular buzzwords ; this field deals with the design of artificial materials utilizing the principles of biomaterials @xcite . + it was already late afternoon and albert decided to revise a pending manuscript of a paper that needed minor amendments .",
    "he promised to narrate the story of each individual machine ( i.e. , their structure and function ) during the next few weekends .",
    "but , before they dispersed , albert asked alex to summarize what emerged from their long discussion .",
    "+ alex : in recent years it has become clear that the cell is not a passive fluid medium .",
    "rather , a cell is more like a factory where active biological processes are driven by coordinated operation of a large variety of molecular machines each of which performs a specific function .",
    "one of the challenges of fundamental research on these machines is to understand the mechanisms of their operation in terms of the physical principles governing their structure and dynamics .",
    "the results of these investigations are likely to have significant impact on applied research in biomedical sciences and have opened up novel approaches to nano - technology .",
    "biomolecular nano - machines have become a subject of truly interdisciplinary research that involves biology , chemistry , physics as well as engineering and technology .",
