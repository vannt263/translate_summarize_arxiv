    "let us recollect well known feynman s talks , relevant to presented theme .",
    "the first one , is the caltech lecture `` there s plenty of room at the bottom '' in 1959 @xcite often is considered between the origins of nanotecnnologies .",
    "the second one , is the keynote speech `` simulating physics with computers '' @xcite in 1981 at the conference physcomp81 `` physics and computations '' about physical background of computing and information technologies .",
    "main part of this talk was devoted to quantum processes .    in this speech",
    "was established some ideas , essential for the development of quantum computations and communication , but not only that . the simulation",
    " is detailed modeling of a physical process . for quantum systems",
    "it is the especial challenge , because the formulations of the quantum theory is often similar with a `` black box '' @xcite description .    a positive result of the research of _ physics of computations _",
    "was understanding of principle possibility of information processing by devices with elements of the atomic size .",
    "sometimes it was even necessary to critically revisit some widespread ideas .",
    "for example , elements in such a scale often may be more adopted for _ reversible _ operations , but most gates in standard computer design are _",
    "irreversible_.    charles bennett suggested a model of a reversible turing machine and even denoted a similarity of such a model with dna and rna @xcite .",
    "the reversible turing machine has direct generalization on quantum systems and it was demonstrated in few works of paul benioff , including the presentation on already mentioned physcomp81 @xcite .",
    "feynman s representation is more close to the modern description of computers by gates and circuits , but uses specific attributes of quantum mechanics @xcite .    in section [ sec : qubits ]",
    "is reminded an abstract quantum analogue of classical bit . in section [ sec : quprop ] are briefly discussed distribution of signals in nanosystems and relevant quantum effects . in section [ sec : perf ] is revisited so - called perfect state transfer .",
    "section [ sec : weyl ] is devoted to weyl commutation relations .",
    "there is widespread notation @xmath0 and @xmath1 for two basic states of a quantum system , which often is called _ quantum bit _ or _ ``",
    "qubit''_. feynman had used for manipulations with a qubit expressions with formal operators of _ annihilation _ and _ creation _ : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider a set with eight qubits .",
    "basic states of such a `` quantum byte '' may be described as strings of zeros and units : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "it can be simply estimated , there are @xmath10 basic states or @xmath11 for a system with @xmath12 particles .",
    "it is in agreement rather with the principles of quantum mechanics , than with the classical case . in `` computer notation ''",
    "it is clear enough even without more pedantic consideration of tensor product of linear spaces describing a state of the quantum system .",
    "an illustrative classical picture still exists for one qubit and any state may be represented by direction of some `` arrow , '' like two basic states : `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' . for a classical case description of such a system",
    "also demands two parameters , _",
    "e.g. _ , the euler angles .",
    "but this visual correspondence disappears in a case with few systems , because in the classical world for description of @xmath12 `` arrows ''",
    "it would be necessary to use only @xmath13 parameters instead of @xmath11 .    of course",
    ", classical bits may be represented in the classical model , as a discrete set with @xmath11 elements inside of a space with @xmath13 _ continuous _ parameters .",
    "the quantum model with @xmath11 parameters also includes this set ( figure [ fig_chain]a ) , and here each element _ directly _ conforms to a continuous parameter .",
    "a )             b )             the quantum model corresponds to a classical one , if only states of _ separate _ qubits may differ from two fixed options of usual bit ( figure [ fig_chain]b ) .",
    "the difference @xmath14 is an approximate estimation of _ `` non - classicality '' _ and it grows very fast with the number of systems @xmath12 .    _ this consideration of complexity has relevance with presented theme , because the nano - scale domain describes aggregates with more than one quantum system , but it is still not big enough to use statistical laws . the quantum theory of information provides the convenient language for description of systems with not very big amount of elements due to appropriate level of abstraction . _    for example , the same model may be applied to different quantum systems .",
    "a spin one - half system was used in the visual picture above , but the _ qubit _ is a model for many other systems with two states , like photons or quantum dots .",
    "multi - qubit systems like `` quantum byte '' also may be associated not only with spin chain ( figure [ fig_chain ] ) , but with quantum dots arrays ( figure [ fig_ddots ] ) and other implementations @xcite .",
    "let us discuss now application of some ideas to next generations of nanotechnologies .",
    "such devices are still in a state of development and it may be reasonable to pay attention to processes in biosystems .",
    "recent time active research is carried out with respect to descendants of most ancient `` nanodevices '' existing on the earth about three milliards years or so .",
    "it is the light - harvesting complex of some microorganisms .",
    "the importance of quantum effects for this case is already almost impossible to deny .",
    "the significant contribution for understanding here is due to works with participation of experts in quantum theory of information @xcite .",
    "let us consider a problem of the effective transfer of absorbed photon energy to different elements of a nanosystem",
    ". in the biological systems mentioned above the effectiveness may be about 99% .",
    "it is astonishing with taking into consideration of quantum uncertainty , because it apparently should hinder the optimal transfer .    yet",
    "biophysical processes in such systems formally look as not relevant with information transfer , a set of problems and methods applied there are very similar with the statement of a question about an effective transmission of signals in a nanodevice with taking into account of quantum effects .",
    "_ e.g. _ , in paper @xcite is suggested a transfer model based on a quantum analogue of the random walk . in the classical case",
    "a chaotic motion may be considered as a quite effective way of a transport in complicated compact systems .",
    "uncertainty of positions and trajectories in quantum mechanics needs for the special consideration .",
    "there is well known approach with the suggestion about state localization due to the interaction with the environment .",
    "it is one possible explanation of the transition from quantum to classical world @xcite .",
    "related ideas about decoherence assisted transport may be more or less directly used in some models about effective energy transfer in the light - harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "some classical models are tested very well for the macroscopic level and it is not clear at that scale they are still work for nanosystems .",
    "it is reasonable to check a possibility of description of the effective transfer without appealing to semi - empiric regularities acting on the boundary between quantum and classical world @xcite .",
    "indeed , the possibility of the `` perfect '' transfer of an excitation in `` purely '' quantum approach was also found recently @xcite .",
    "similar methods was only briefly mentioned in the relation with the biophysical systems discussed above @xcite .    in the works",
    "@xcite were also considered some aspects of this approach , appropriate to the present discussion .",
    "it can be said , the model of perfect transfer is an analogue of shift register : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath8 @xmath16 @xmath18 . here",
    "unit corresponds to the excited state .",
    "coefficients describing strength of interactions between adjacent nodes of the chain may be chosen in such a way , to ensure localization of excitation only for two ends of chain and perfect transfer from first to last node @xcite .",
    "let us recollect some essential ideas .",
    "the quantum information science is most often related with quantum systems with _",
    "finite _ number of ( basic ) states and it was quite clear from examples with qubits above . in more general case the term _ qudit _ is often used for a quantum system with @xmath19 states , _",
    "e.g. _ , a particle with spin @xmath20 corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "qubit is the particular case with @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ".    other model of qudit is some particle in a lattice with @xmath19 locations .",
    "two simple examples with @xmath19 nodes are _ ring _ ( figure  [ fig_latt]a ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 - 4 ) and a _ line",
    "_ ( figure  [ fig_latt]b ) ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "if we consider a _",
    "electron in such a circular or linear system , the wave numbers @xmath24 of stationary states may be expressed as @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively ( * ? ? ?",

    "such chains may be used for quantum communications @xcite , but a nonlinear dispersion law like eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) may be considered as a certain obstacle for the good transmission .",
    "already mentioned earlier _ perfect _ scheme of transport has _",
    "varying _ amplitudes of transition @xcite @xmath30    such a model may appear more natural , if to consider a simpler equivalent @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the continuous case the ideal transmission of a signal might be obtained with the linear law of dispersion @xmath31 . for the quantum case with the discrete lattice",
    "there is similar approach .",
    "let us denote a state with occupation of only @xmath32th node as @xmath33 , _ cf _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 13 - 1 ) .",
    "a spin chain also may be used @xcite instead of the lattice with @xmath19 states . yet , the chain has @xmath34 basic states ( figure [ fig_chain]a ) , only @xmath19-dimensional subspace is used @xcite and it illustrates rather standard correspondence between such lattices ( * ? ? ?",

    "15 ) .    if to consider a _ ring _ ( figure  [ fig_latt]a ) with @xmath19 nodes , the ideal scheme of transfer could be described via _",

    "similar states were already mentioned above in relation with a `` molecular '' ring , figure [ fig_latt ] .",
    "these states had the fixed wave number @xmath38 .",
    "a simplest analogy of a continuous model with linear dispersion may be provided by hamiltonian with eigenvectors @xmath39 described by eq .",
    "( [ mom ] ) and equidistant eigenvalues , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath40 with unessential constant @xmath41 .    evolution of a system due to such hamiltonian in the same basis may be expressed via a diagonal matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath42 it is convenient to choose time step @xmath43 because the matrix of evolution of the quantum system for such a time period coincides with introduced earlier eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) matrix of cyclic shift @xmath44 _ i.e. _ , it is expressed in basis @xmath39 as @xmath45 so , on the one hand , @xmath46 is a discrete analogue of operator with linear dispersion , on the other one , it ensures perfect transmission eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) of local state along chain .",
    "the advantage of such approach is very clear law of evolution eq .",

    "it is useful to look for hamiltonians with the same equidistant spectra , but nonzero values of transition only for @xmath47 .",
    "analogues of angular momentum components operators like @xmath48 or @xmath49 have necessary properties and in @xcite was used such a formal hamiltonian with only nonzero elements @xmath50 corresponding to eq .",

    "there is a subtle problem , because instead of one - way transmission the state is rather circulating between two ends of the lattice with period @xmath54 .",
    "it may be resolved by controlled state transfer , like _ quantum bots ( qubots ) _ discussed in @xcite or more cumbersome schemes .",
    "the consideration above illustrates application of general methods for description of information transfer in the different types of _ quantum wires_. from the one hand it takes into account quite specific properties of quantum systems , from the other one it draws a parallel with the traditional information science .",
