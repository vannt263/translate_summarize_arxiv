    "in our solar system , zodiacal dust grains are warm ( @xmath4150k ) and found within @xmath23au of the sun .",
    "slow but persistent collisions between asteroids complemented by material released from comets now replenish these particles .",
    "similar warm dust particles around other stars are also expected and would be manifested as excess mid - infrared emission .",
    "the implication of `` warm '' excess stars for the terrestrial planet - building process has prompted many searches including several pointed observing campaigns with _",
    "however , a lack of consensus of what constitutes a `` warm excess '' has resulted in ambiguity and some confusion in the field .",
    "for example , spitzer surveys with mips revealed a number of stars with excess emission in the 24@xmath0 band .",
    "however , very few of these may turn out as genuine `` warm excess '' stars because the detected 24@xmath0 emission is mostly the wien tail of emission from cold ( t @xmath5 150k ) dust grains @xcite .    for black - body grains , @xmath6 = t@xmath7(r@xmath7/(2r@xmath8)@xmath9 , where r@xmath10 is the distance of a grain from a star of radius r@xmath7 and temperature t@xmath7 . due to the dependence of @xmath6 on t@xmath7 and r@xmath7 ,",
    "the terrestrial planetary zone ( tpz ) around high mass stars extends further out than that around low mass stars .",
    "therefore , r@xmath10 is not a good way to define the tpz while dust equilibrium temperature is equally applicable to all main - sequence stars . in our solar system",
    ", t@xmath10 is 150k near the outer boundary of the asteroid belt ( @xmath23.5au ) , and the zodiacal dust particles are sufficiently large ( @xmath230@xmath0 ) that they do radiate like blackbodies . to specify a tpz independent of the mass of the central star",
    ", we define the tpz to be the region where t@xmath11 150k",
    ". then an a0 star has 25au and an m0 star has 0.9au as the outer boundary of their tpz . because of the way it is defined , tpz applies only to the location of grains that radiate like a blackbody .",
    "according to the spitzer surveys listed above , the presence of dust in the tpz characterized by excess in the mid - ir is quite rare for stars @xmath410myrs old . for ages in the range of @xmath12myr , a posited period of the terrestrial planet formation in our solar system",
    ", only a few stars appear to possess warm dust according to our analysis ( see @xmath13 5 and table 1 ) : @xmath14  cha , a b8 member of 8 myr old @xmath14 cha cluster @xcite , @xmath14  tel & hd  172555 , a0- and a7- type members of the 12 myr old @xmath15 pic moving group @xcite , hd  3003 , an a0 member of the 30 myr old tucana / horologium moving group @xcite , and hd  113766 , an f3 binary star ( 1.2@xmath16 separation , @xcite ) , in the lower centaurus crux ( lcc ) association @xcite .    in this paper , we present the a9 star ef cha , another example of this rare group of stars with warm dust at the epoch of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "hipparcos , 2mass and mid course experiment ( msx , @xcite ) sources were cross - correlated to identify main - sequence stars with excess emission at mid - ir wavelengths . out of @xmath268,000 hipparcos dwarfs with @xmath17 @xmath18 6.0 ( ) - 2.0 ( see @xcite for an explanation of this @xmath17 constraint ) in a search radius of 10@xmath16 , @xmath21000 stars within 120 pc of earth were identified with potential msx counterparts .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( sed ) were created for all @xmath21,000 msx identified hipparcos dwarfs . observed fluxes from tycho-2 @xmath19 and @xmath20 and 2mass @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , were fit to a stellar atmospheric model @xcite via a @xmath24@xmath25 minimization method ( see @xcite , for detailed description of sed fitting ) . from these sed fits ,",
    "about 100 hipparcos dwarfs were retained that showed apparent excess emission in the msx 8@xmath0 band ( that is , the ratio [ msx flux - photosphere flux ] / msx flux uncertainty must be @xmath26 3.0 ) . since a typical positional 3@xmath27 uncertainty of msx is @xmath26@xmath16 @xcite and msx surveyed the galactic plane , a careful background check is required to eliminate contamination sources . by over - plotting the 2mass sources on the digital sky survey ( dss ) images , we eliminated more than half of the apparent excess stars that included any dubious object ( i.e. , extended objects , extremely red objects , etc . ) within a 10@xmath16 radius from the star . among the stars that passed this visual check ,",
    "ef  cha was selected for follow - up observations at the gemini south telescope .",
    "independent iras detections at 12 and 25@xmath0 made ef  cha one of the best candidates for further investigation .",
    "an n - band image and a spectrum of ef  cha were obtained using the thermal - region camera spectrograph ( t - recs ) at the gemini south telescope in march and july of 2006 ( gs-2006a - q-10 ) , respectively .",
    "thanks to the queue observing mode at gemini observatory , the data were obtained under good seeing and photometric conditions .",
    "the standard `` beam switching '' mode was used in all observations in order to suppress sky emission and radiation from the telescope .",
    "data were obtained chopping the secondary at a frequency of 2.7 hz and noddding the telescope every @xmath230sec . chopping and nodding",
    "were set to the same direction , parallel to the slit for spectroscopy .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were carried out to reduce the image and the spectrum of ef  cha at n - band .",
    "raw images were first sky - subtracted using the sky frame from each chop pair .",
    "bad pixels were replaced by the median of their neighboring pixels .",
    "aperture photometry was performed with a radius of 9 pixels ( 0.9@xmath16 ) and sky annuli of 14 to 20 pixels .",
    "the spectrum of a standard star ( hd 129078 ) was divided by a planck function with the star s effective temperature ( 4500k ) and this ratioed spectrum was then divided into the spectrum of ef  cha to remove telluric and instrumental features .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed using atmospheric transition lines from an unchopped raw frame .",
    "the 1-d spectrum was extracted by weighted averaging of 17 rows .    for the n - band imaging photometry , the on - source integration time of 130 seconds produced s / n @xmath26 30 with fwhm @xmath20.54@xmath16 . for the n - band spectrum ,",
    "a 886 second on - source exposure resulted in s / n @xmath26 20 . a standard star , hip 57092 ,",
    "was observed close in time and position to our target and was used for flux calibration of the n - band image of ef  cha . for spectroscopy , hd 129078 , a kiii 2.5 star , was observed after ef  cha at a similar airmass and served as a telluric standard .",
    "while our paper was being reviewed , spitzer multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) archival images of ef  cha at 24 and 70@xmath0 were released from the gould s belt legacy program led by lori allen .",
    "ef  cha was detected at mips 24@xmath0 band but not at mips 70@xmath0 band .",
    "we performed aperture photometry for ef  cha at 24@xmath0 on the post - bcd image produced by spitzer science center mips pipeline .",
    "we used aperture correction of 1.167 for the 24@xmath0 image given at the ssc mips website ( http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/mips/apercorr/ ) with aperture radius of 13and sky inner and outer annuli of 20 and 32 , respectively . for mips 70@xmath0 data , we estimated 3  @xmath27 upper limits to the non - detection on the mosaic image that we produced using mopex software on bcd images .",
    "table  2 lists the mid - ir measurements of ef  cha from msx , iras , mips , and gemini t - recs observations .",
    "the t - recs n - band image ( fov of 28.8@xmath16 @xmath28 21.6 @xmath16 ) confirmed that no other mid - ir source appears in the vicinity of ef  cha and that the mid - ir excess detected by the space observatories ( iras & msx ) originates solely from ef  cha .",
    "a strong silicate emission feature in the n - band spectrum ( figure 1 ) indicates the presence of warm , small ( @xmath29 @xmath1 5@xmath0 , see figure 6 in @xcite ) dust particles .",
    "amorphous silicate grains dominate the observed emission feature .",
    "however , crystalline silicate structure , probably forsterite , appears as a small bump near 11.3@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) particles can also produce an emission feature at 11.3@xmath0 .",
    "however , absence of other strong pah emission features at 7.7 and 8.6@xmath0 indicates that the weak 11.3@xmath0 feature does not arise from pahs .",
    "furthermore , although pah particles do appear in some very young stellar systems , they have not been detected around stars as old as 10 myr .",
    "in contrast , crystalline silicates such as olivine , forsterite , etc . are seen in a few such stellar systems @xcite .",
    "the dust continuum excess of ef  cha was fit with a single temperature blackbody curve at 240k by matching the flux density at 13@xmath0 and the mips 70@xmath0 upper limit ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the 3  @xmath27 upper limit at mips 70@xmath0 band indicates that the dust temperature should not be colder than 240k .",
    "figure 1 shows that mips 24@xmath0 flux is @xmath230mjy lower than iras 25@xmath0 flux . due to the small mips aperture size compared with iras , mips",
    "24@xmath0 flux often comes out smaller when nearby contaminating sources are included in the large iras beam .",
    "the ground - based t - recs ( 28.8@xmath2821.6 ) image of ef  cha at n - band , however , shows no contaminating source in the vicinity of ef  cha .",
    "thus , the higher flux density at iras 25@xmath0 perhaps indicates the presence of a significant silicate emission feature near 18@xmath0 included in the wide passband of the iras 25@xmath0 filter ( 18.5 @xmath30 29.8@xmath0 ) .",
    "a recent spitzer irs observation of another warm excess star , bd+20 307 @xcite , shows a similar discrepancy between the iras 25@xmath0 flux and mips 24@xmath0 flux in the presence of a significant silicate emission feature at @xmath218@xmath0 ( weinberger et al .",
    "2007 in preparation ) , consistent with our interpretation .",
    "mips 24@xmath0 flux is slightly above our 240k dust continuum fit .",
    "the wide red wing of an 18@xmath0 silicate emission feature could contribute to a slight increase in mips 24@xmath0 flux .",
    "ef  cha was detected in the rosat x - ray all sky survey with @xmath31 which suggests a very young age for an a9 star ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "on the basis of this x - ray measurement , hipparcos distance ( 106 pc ) , location in the sky ( ra = 12@xmath3207@xmath33 , dec= -79@xmath32 ) , and proper motion ( pmra = -40.2@xmath341.2 & pmde = -8.4@xmath341.3 in mas / yr ) , ef  cha is believed to be a member of the `` cha - near '' moving group ( avg .",

    "dec = -79@xmath32 , avg .",
    "pmra = -41.13@xmath341.3 & avg .",
    "pmdec = -3.32@xmath340.86 in mas / yr , @xcite ) , which is @xmath210 myr old and typically @xmath290pc from earth .",
    "large blackbody grains in thermal equilibrium at 240k , would be located @xmath24.3au from ef cha while small grains , especially those responsible for the silicate emission features in our n - band spectrum , radiate less efficiently and could be located at @xmath264.3au .",
    "recent spitzer mips observations confirmed that all aforementioned ( @xmath13 1 ) warm excess stars do not have a cold dust population , indicating few large grains at large distances @xcite .",
    "lack of cold large grains , in turn , suggests local origin of the small grains seen in these warm excess stars . without cold excess from spitzer mips 70@xmath0 data , small grains in ef",
    "cha should originate in the tpz , probably by the breakup of large grains in the tpz , rather than inward migration from an outer disk . even in the unlikely event that silicate emission comes from small grains in an outer disk that were blown away by radiation pressure as in vega @xcite ,",
    "the dominant carrier of 240k continuum emission would still be large grains ( aigen li 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "the fraction of the stellar luminosity reradiated by dust , @xmath35 , is @xmath36 , which was obtained by dividing the infrared excess between 7@xmath0 and 60@xmath0 by the bolometric stellar luminosity .",
    "this @xmath35 is @xmath210,000 times larger than that of the current sun s zodiacal cloud ( @xmath37 ) but appears to be moderate for known debris disk systems at similar ages ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that the ratio of dust mass to @xmath35 of a debris system is proportional to the inverse - square of dust particle semimajor axis for semimajor axes between @xmath29au and @xmath2100au . for systems with dust radius @xmath59au ,",
    "this relationship overestimates the dust mass .",
    "instead , we calculate the mass of a debris ring around ef  cha using @xmath38 ( eqn . 4 in @xcite ) , where @xmath39 is the density of an individual grain , @xmath40 is the dust luminosity , and @xmath41 is the average grain radius . because @xcite analyzed @xmath42  lep , a star of similar spectral type to ef  cha , we adopt their model for grain size distribution .",
    "assuming r@xmath10 = 4.3au , @xmath39 = 2.5 g  @xmath43 , and @xmath41 = 3@xmath0 , the dust mass is @xmath44 g ( @xmath210@xmath45 @xmath46 ) .",
    "grains with @xmath29 @xmath47 3@xmath0 will radiate approximately as blackbodies at wavelengths shorter than @xmath22@xmath48@xmath29 ( @xmath220@xmath0 ) .",
    "as may be seen from figure 1 , most of the excess ir emission at ef  cha appears at wavelengths @xmath120@xmath0 .    for blackbody grains at @xmath24.3au with , for example , radius @xmath29 @xmath47 3@xmath0 , the poynting robertson ( p - r ) drag",
    "time scale was used for the stellar luminosity of ef  cha with a bolometric correction of -0.102 @xcite .",
    "absolute visual magnitude of ef  cha is 2.35 based on the hipparcos distance of 106 pc . ]",
    "is only @xmath49 years , much less than 10 myrs .",
    "yet smaller grains with @xmath50 1.3@xmath0 would be easily blown away by radiation pressure on a much shorter time - scale .",
    "successive collisions among grains can effectively remove dust particles by grinding down large bodies into smaller grains , which then can be blown out . the characteristic collision time ( orbital period/@xmath35 ) of dust grains at 4.3au from this a9 star is @xmath51 years . both pr time and collision time",
    "were derived assuming no gas was present in the disk . while gas has not been actively searched for in ef  cha , few debris disk systems at @xmath4 10 myr show presence of gas , indicating early dispersal of gas @xcite .",
    "a possibility of an optically thin gas disk surviving around a @xmath210 myr system was investigated by @xcite .",
    "however their model of gas disk is pertinent to cool dust at large distances ( @xmath4 120 au ) , but not to warm dust close to the central star as in ef  cha .",
    "in addition , a recent study of ob associations shows that the lifetime of a primordial inner disk is @xmath1 3myr for herbig",
    "ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "based on the very short time scales of dust grain removal , essentially all grains responsible for significant excess emission at ef  cha in the mid - ir are , therefore , likely to be second generation , not a remnant of primordial dust .    [ [ debris - disk - systems - in - the - tpz - during - the - epoch - of - planet - formation ] ] debris disk systems in the tpz during the epoch of planet formation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the presence of hot dust has been recognized around other @xmath210myr stars , for example , tw  hya , hd  98800 , & hen  3 - 600 in the tw hydrae association .",
    "interesting characteristics of these systems are their large @xmath35 ( @xmath52 ) and late - k and m spectral types .",
    "tw  hya and hen  3 - 600 show flat ir sed up to 160@xmath0 consistent with active accretion in their disks @xcite .",
    "combined with the presence of substantial gas emission lines from tw  hya , the observed infrared excess emission , at least for these two stars , appears to arise from gaseous dusty disks left over from the protostellar environment . on the other hand ,",
    "a lack of gas emission ( @xcite ) and the quadruple nature of the hd 98800 system has invoked a flared debris disk as an alternative explanation for its large infrared excess emission @xcite .",
    "many young stars come in multiple systems .",
    "however , they hardly display such a high @xmath35 as that of hd  98800 .",
    "thus , the dust disk around hd  98800 might be an unusual transient pheonomeon such that it still contains a dust population composed of a mixture of promordial grains and replenished debris .",
    "some stars display a mixture of warm and cold grains where the overall infrared excess emissions is dominated by the cold dust .",
    "table  1 summarizes the currently known disk systems with warm dust regardless of spectral type and the presence of cold excess or remnant primordial dust at @xmath53myr .",
    "what separates ef  cha from the stars described in the previous paragraph is that most of the infrared excess emission , if not all , arises from warm dust in the tpz , and as described in @xmath135.1 , these grains are , clearly , not a remnant of the protostellar disk .",
    "recent spitzer mips observation shows null detection of ef cha at 70@xmath0 band , leaving the presence of substantial cold dust unlikely ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the recent spitzer observations of other similar table  1 early - type warm excess systems ( @xmath14  tel , hd  3003 , hd  172555 and hd  113766 ) in which cold dust from a region analogous to the sun s kuiper belt objects is missing @xcite . in the following discussion , we characterize warm excess stars as those with warm dust in the tpz only and without cold excess ( i.e. , we exclude stars like @xmath15 pictoris ) .    the fact that all currently known warm excess stars at ages between @xmath12 myr belong to nearby stellar moving groups offers an excellent opportunity to address how frequently warm excess emission appears among young stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "@xcite list suggested members of stellar moving groups and clusters ( i.e. , @xmath14  cha cluster , tw hydra association , @xmath15  pictoris moving group , cha - near moving group , and tucana / horologium association ) at ages @xmath12 myr , within 100 pc of earth .",
    "currently spitzer mips archive data are available for all 18 members of the @xmath14 cha cluster , all 24 members of twa , all 52 members of tucana / horologium , 25 out of 27 @xmath15 pic moving group , and 9 out of 19 members of cha - near moving group .",
    "multiple systems were counted as one object unless resolved by spitzer .",
    "for example , in the @xmath15 pictoris moving group , hd  155555a , hd  155555b & hd",
    "155555c were counted as a single object ; however , hip  10679 & hip  10680 were counted as two objects .",
    "table 1 shows that the characteristics of dust grains depend on the spectral type of the central star .",
    "all six warm debris disks considered in this paper harbor early - type central stars ( earlier than f3 ) .",
    "however , late - type stars in table 1 ( for example , pds 66 , a k1v star from lcc ) sometimes show characteristics of t  tauri - like disk excess ( i.g . , @xmath54 , flat ir sed , etc . )",
    "even at @xmath410 myr @xcite .",
    "such apparent spectral dependency perhaps arises from the relatively young ages ( @xmath210myr ) of these systems in which late - type stars still possess grains mixed with primordial dust due to a longer dust removal time scale @xcite . in the above - mentioned five nearby stellar moving groups , 38 out of 129 stars with spitzer mips measurements",
    "have spectral types earlier than g0 .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath213% ( 5/38 ) occurrence rate for the warm excess phenomenon among the stars with spectral types earlier than g0 in the nearby stellar groups at @xmath12 myr .",
    "( beta pic is the only early - type star among the remaing 33 which has both warm and cold dust . ) for lcc , at least one ( hd  113766 ) out of 20 early - type members is a warm excess star giving 5% frequency ( see table 1 & 2 in @xcite ) . this rate can reach a maximum of 30% when we take into account five early - type lcc members that show excess emission at 24@xmath0 but have only upper - limit measurements at mips 70@xmath0 band .",
    "g0 type was chosen to separate the two apparently different populations because no g - type star except t  cha appears in table 1 .",
    "furthermore , the spectral type of t  cha is not well established ( g2-g8 ) and it may be a k - type star like other k / m stars in table 1 .",
    "rhee et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) analyze all spectral types in the young nearby moving groups and conclude that the warm excess phenomenon with @xmath55 occurs for between 4 and 7% ; this uncertainty arises because some stars have only upper limits to their 70@xmath0 fluxes .",
