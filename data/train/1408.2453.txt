    "<S> strong driving @xmath57 exceeds unity ( enhancement ) and increases towards higher densities ( smaller sphere radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the laser dephasings are chosen relatively large , the enhancement persists for all densities . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the excitation enhancement should be observable under realistic experimental conditions as long as the regime of strong coherent driving ( @xmath75 ) is reached . through time - dependent simulations we also verified that the steady state is reached in less than @xmath93s for these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> one option to observe the excitation enhancement effect could thus be to vary the cloud density at constant atom number , for example by thermal expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the excitation enhancement has a number of consequences for understanding light - matter interactions in strongly - interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the nonlinear optical response of a rydberg gas driven under eit conditions is predicted to obey a universal relation between the optical susceptibility @xmath94 $ ] and the rydberg fraction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this relation states that in the case of perfect eit @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the susceptibility in the two - level case , i.e. , without coupling laser . our finding that @xmath54 would therefore predict a negative susceptibility , hence showing the universal relation must break down in the collectively enhanced regime . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we show that coherences between @xmath0-atom collective states and direct two - photon processes are important for determining the steady - state of this system under realistic experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the classical rate equation ( re ) models which neglect these coherences  @xcite are not sufficient to describe the most important details of the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> while these models do reproduce the @xmath1 collective enhancement , they can not describe the effect reported here since @xmath97 is assumed by construction  @xcite . for comparison , the predictions of a re model  @xcite have been added as dashed lines in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fbl_me](c ) , which qualitatively fail to reproduce the enhancement reported here . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation enhancement therefore acts as a clear experimental signature for the breakdown of the re approach .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the influence of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> typically , it is challenging to distinguish between coherent and incoherent excitation dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation enhancement reported here manifests itself in a global observable in steady - state and is thus comparatively easy to access experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> since it is associated with a direct two - photon process , it requires at least partly coherent dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that if single atom dephasing is added , @xmath57 decreases monotonically and falls below unity when dephasing dominates .    in summary , we have discovered a counter - intuitive excitation enhancement effect that occurs for strong driving of the upper and weak driving of the lower transition of interacting three - level rydberg atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that this effect is connected to direct multi - photon transitions between collective dicke states and have derived analytical expressions for the steady state density for arbitrary atom number @xmath0 , which are capable of reproducing the observed enhancement effect in the weak probe limit . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement allows to detect the presence of coherent multi - photon processes , and to identify parameter regimes in which the re approach breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> as the enhancement involves a global steady state observable it should be observable with existing experimental setups @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural next step would be to ask how the observed excitation enhancement is connected to the build - up of multi - partite entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is interesting to ask whether similar enhancements could be observed in other strongly interacting driven systems , or if the generated multi - particle coherences will find applications in metrology or in quantum information science .    </S>",
