    "+ the main features of the models are as follows :    * in summary , we considered the modified gravity which naturally unifies two expansion phases of the universe : inflation at early times and cosmic acceleration at current epoch .",
    "* the models are based on exact solutions of the @xmath9 gravity field equations for the anisotropic bianchi - v space - time filled with perfect fluid with time dependent @xmath10-term . *",
    "the model represents an expanding , shearing , non - rotating and accelerating universe . * for suitable choice of constants the anisotropic parameter @xmath181 tends to zero for sufficiently large time ( fig .",
    "@xmath204 ) . hence",
    ", the present model is isotropic at late time which is consistent to the current observations . *",
    "it has been found that @xmath10 is a decreasing function of time and it converges to a small positive value at late time .",
    "the nature of decaying vacuum energy density @xmath248 in our derived model is supported by recent cosmological observations .",
    "these observations on magnitude and red - shift of type ia supernova suggest that our universe may be an accelerating one with induced cosmological density through the cosmological @xmath10-term .",
    "* in literature it is a plebeian practice to consider constant deceleration parameter .",
    "now for a universe which was decelerated in past and accelerating at present epoch , the dp must show signature flipping as already discussed .",
    "therefore , our consideration of dp to be variable is physically justified .",
    "our derived model is accelerating at present epoch . * for different choice of @xmath5",
    ", we can generate a class of viable cosmological models of the universe in bianchi type - v space - time .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath249 in eq .",
    "( [ eq39 ] ) , we find @xmath250 which is used by pradhan et al .",
    "@xcite in studying the accelerating dark energy models in bianchi type-@xmath144 space - time and pradhan et al .",
    "@xcite in studying bianchi type - i cosmological models with time dependent @xmath10-term .",
    "it is observed that such models are also in good harmony with current observations . *",
    "we observe that our derived solutions are physically acceptable in concordance with the fulfillment of wec , dec and sec .",
    "the sound speed @xmath226 ( see in fig 2 ) .",
    "the models in @xmath9 theory of gravity has stability and has initial singularity .",
    "wald @xcite pointed out that bianchi cosmologies ( except bianchi @xmath251 ) with @xmath10 and satisfying dec and sec will enter in a phase of exponential expansion .",
    "* @xmath12 diagram ( fig .",
    "@xmath240 ) shows that the evolution of the universe starts from einstein static era ( @xmath252 ) and approaches to @xmath10cdm model ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "so , from the statefinder parameter @xmath12 , the behaviour of different stages of the evolution of the universe have been generated .",
    "thus , the solutions demonstrated in this paper may be useful for better understanding of the characteristic of bianchi type - v cosmological models in the evolution of the universe within the framework of @xmath0 gravity theory .",
