    "current instruments dedicated to the imaging of exo - planets have a contrast floor that is set by the imperfections on the surfaces of the the optical train . in the case of a space observatory ,",
    "as shown for instance by @xcite , when the optical surfaces corrugations are stable in time , the instrument response can be calibrated and subtracted . however , in the ground based regime , the psf varies over timescales that range from minutes to hours e.g @xcite . since these so called quasi - static speckles are the limiting factor of ground and spaced - based observations with regard to faint companion detectability , their properties have been studied extensively over the past few years .",
    "it was found that their theoretical properties ( @xcite ) match the statistics observed on - sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "several observing techniques and data reduction algorithms have been devised over the past few years in order to optimize the sensitivity of current imaging instruments to faint exo - planets .",
    "observations are generally carried out by acquiring of a series of images in which the observer deliberately chooses to introduce some diversity in the imaging method .",
    "the purpose of this diversity is to force the image location of the residual speckles to vary from frame to frame , while the image of the sky is immobile .",
    "this is the case in the angular differential imaging ( @xcite ) , spectral differential imaging ( @xcite ) , chromatic differential imaging ( @xcite ) and coherent imaging ( @xcite ) .",
    "post - processing techniques involve a manipulation of this series of images whose purpose is to remove the artifacts due to speckles and leave intact the signal of a companion . the powerful combination of adi data processed using a locally optimized combination of images ( loci ) psf subtraction algorithm allowed @xcite to obtain one of the first images of a planetary system .",
    "the loci psf subtraction technique was devised by @xcite and is quickly becoming a standard in exo - planet searches ( @xcite ) .",
    "other techniques currently discussed in the literature involve a - priori models of the psf and the telescope @xcite or spectral deconvolution based on priors about the underlying spectrum of the companion @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "loci only requires minimal priors about the behavior of the instrument and builds a composite reference psf solely on the data obtained during observations .    in a previous paper",
    "we reported a recent implementation of loci that is applied to process data from an integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) , @xcite .",
    "our results were obtained using project 1640 .",
    "the full system is composed of the palomar adaptive optics ( palao ) followed by a stellar coronagraph ( @xcite ) , and the science science ifs .",
    "further details about the instrument are found in @xcite .",
    "the raw data from the infrared detector is calibrated and re - arranged in order to produce a data cube of images at @xmath0 different wavelengths across the j and h bands ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the spatial and spectral data extraction procedures are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the p1640 configuration prevents the field rotation that is necessary to carry out adi observations , but allows both chromatic and temporal diversity .",
    "using an ifs behind a high contrast starlight suppression system is key to the two main science objectives of p1640 : ( a ) detection of faint companions around nearby stars ,",
    "( b ) in - situ low resolution spectral characterization of any companions discovered .",
    "the detection of faint point sources is facilitated by the chromatic diversity of the ifs and allows the observer to apply advanced static speckles calibration methods .",
    "indeed , if all the errors are in an instrument pupil plane , diffractive optics predicts that the speckle pattern will stretch with wavelength , while the scale of the astronomical image is independent of wavelength . in an ifs",
    ", the series of measurements of the quasi - static speckle pattern is simultaneous .",
    "this alleviates the problem of corrugations evolving temporally between sequential observations . on the p1640 camera the speckles located at @xmath2 are at the @xmath3 level and de - correlate in intensity by roughly @xmath4 percent per minute",
    "this implies that purely sequential observations , separated by @xmath5 minutes in time , can at best reach a contrast of @xmath6 after subtraction .",
    "using an ifs alleviates this problem as it provides reference psfs which are contemporaneous realizations of the speckle pattern present in the science exposure .",
    "each wavelength slice can be interpolated in order to produce rescaled data cubes in which the speckle pattern s scale remains constant .",
    "in this rescaled space the companion moves radially . if the variations of the speckle s brightness as a function of wavelength is know a - priori , then these rescaled images can be subtracted one to another to detect a faint companion .",
    "this approach was first discussed in @xcite and has been successfully applied to both simulated and on - sky ifs data .",
    "it is very powerful as it uses reference images that have all been acquired simultaneously , thus reducing the impact of the temporal evolution of the speckles to time scales shorter than the exposure time .",
    "in @xcite we presented an algorithm that combines the chromatic differential imaging in @xcite with the loci psf subtraction approach .",
    "while loci was first presented in @xcite as a method to reduced adi images , p1640 does not take advantage of field rotation .",
    "instead , the baseline p1640 reduction presented in @xcite relies on the ifs radial chromatic stretch of the psf and on temporal diversity .",
    "it integrates them both in a loci - type reduction scheme.we showed that this quasi - static speckles calibration method provided a gain greater than an order - of - magnitude in the contrast between raw and processed images , and an ultimate detection level @xmath7 at @xmath2 in a @xmath8 minutes h - band exposure on a three magnitude star .",
    "further improvements in contrast , while maintaining reasonable exposure times , require coherent wavefront calibrations , such as the ones presented in @xcite , for the case of space - based observations and @xcite for the case of ground - based telescopes .",
    "a second advantage of the p1640 ifs is that , once a companion is detected by means of the aforementioned chromatic diversity , its spectral information is an immediate by - product . over the past ten years ,",
    "ifs have been used to characterize companions with favorable contrast ratio ( e.g. ) .",
    "when the companions is fainter than the speckle floor , then reductions such as the ones presented in @xcite ought to be carried out to first detect the companion . however , blind applications of loci post - processing tailored for detections to spectral data - cubes present the major caveat of altering the spectro - photometry and possibly introduce artificial features in the low resolution of the detected object .",
    "recent results obtained using the osiris ifs at the keck observatory , show a depletion of sixty percent of the companion flux that is constant over the spectral window ( @xcite ) . in this example",
    "the depletion is gray and as such has little impact on the scientific conclusions of the observations .",
    "however p1640 seeks for faint objects at close angular separations whose signal is buried within the bright speckle field , thus requiring more aggressive psf subtraction .",
    "moreover p1640 entirely relies on chromatic diversity , which can potentially lead to a poor conditioning of the inverse problem associated with loci ( see below ) . in practice ,",
    "when testing our reduction on synthetic objects injected within the control radius of the ao system , we observe that the post - loci retrieved spectral information is considerably biased with a non - gray algorithmic response .",
    "this biasing of the spectral information is entirely due to the psf subtraction algorithm , and can be an order - of - magnitude larger than the next most important uncertainty , due to the telluric calibration described in @xcite .",
    "it stems from two independent phenomena : a bias caused by partial fitting of the companion flux with the starlight in the reference frames , and a spectral cross - talk between actual companion flux between neighboring channels .",
    "the combination of these errors is very often the dominant source of uncertainties in spectroscopic measurements carried out using post - loci subtracted ifs data - cubes .    herein we introduce a new method that lowers the error in the measured spectral energy distribution due to the reduction algorithm close to the level of uncertainty in the telluric calibration . we first introduce a modified version of the loci algorithm that alleviates the problem of flux depletion of faint companions that is common to most locally optimized psf subtraction algorithms .",
    "the `` damped loci '' algorithm introduced in this communication seeks to maximize the residual flux of a putative companion while minimizing the noise due to the quasi - static speckles , whereas standard loci implementations only focus on the latter objective .",
    "this is achieved by re - formulating the least - squares problem associated with finding a locally optimal composite reference psf : we augment the cost function associated with the determination of the composite psf coefficients with a penalty term that scales with the flux of a potential companion .",
    "`` damped loci '' thus solves the following optimization problem  _",
    "minimize the least - squares fit to the local speckle field while maximizing the least - squares fit in the area where a known companion is present _ \" .",
    "the formalism and the notations underlying loci and `` damped loci '' are details in appendix a.  2 focuses on the specifics and the implementation of each algorithm .",
    "both approaches yield comparable performances in terms of band - averaged faint companions snr .",
    "appendix b discusses the second order impact of each method on the detectability problem , and in particular the advantages of `` damped loci '' when the inverse problem associated with the psf reconstruction is ill - conditionned . in ",
    "3 we discuss the core matter of this paper , namely the measurement of the spectrum of faint companions .",
    "when companions have already been detected we show that a series of binary psf weightings , or masking , can be used in conjunction with classical loci methods to retrieve the spectrum of relatively bright objects .",
    "we illustrate however that the performance of such methods degrades rapidly with increasing contrast , and show that using masking in conjunction with `` damped loci '' decouples spectral precision and contrast .",
    "we show that this method yields in all cases better absolute and relative spectro - photmetric accuracy when compared with classical loci reductions . in particular , for objects as bright as the residual speckles , we obtain estimates of the spectral energy distribution of the order of the telluric calibration uncertainties of the spectrograph . for faint objects `` damped loci '' yields sed uncertainties consistent with higher snr ( less `` photon starved '' ) state of the art band - averaged photometric estimates ( @xcite .",
    "as the architecture of future exo - planet imagers and p1640 are similar ( @xcite ) , the results presented here are broadly relevant to the future exo - planet imaging endeavors .",
    "the locally optimized combination of images consists of reconstructing a reference psf from ifs data .",
    "it is based on an inverse problem which seeks minimize the residuals between a given astronomical image , the target image to be reduced , and a calibration image .",
    "the algorithm , as introduced by @xcite , seeks to find an optimal combination of images , within an ensemble of reference frames , that locally minimizes the least - squares residual between the target frame and the composite reference , in a large optimization zone of the image , @xmath9 zone .",
    "this weighted reference is then subtracted from the reduced image for only a small subset of pixels , the subtraction zone , @xmath10 zone .",
    "@xcite presented how such an approach can be utilized to reduced ifs data .",
    "appendix a details the specifics of the frame selection and the notations underlying the present manuscript . in this section",

    "carrying out a selection of the most relevant slices in @xmath17 , so that the number of independent references matches @xmath34 , the number of psf cores , ought to be done locally and iteratively ( @xcite ) .",
    "it represents a considerable computational overhead and in practice , loci reductions are carried out with @xmath33 constant over large portions of the image .",
    "then , in the zones for which the problem is ill - posed , generic pseudo - inverse routines or eigenvalues truncations provide a robust alternative , at the cost of losing track of the physics in the process .",
    "indeed , such inversion methods lead to the subtraction of the least correlated modes in the reference images .",
    "if the flux of the companion in the target frame can be described using some of these independent reference modes , then some of its flux is subtracted by the composite reference .",
    "the photometric information is then biased .",
    "choosing an optimization zone much larger than the subtraction zone , a larger @xmath34 , mitigates this issue .",
    "it increases the contribution of pixels that do not see any companion flux and reduces the likelihood of fitting modes associated with the companion with one of the reference modes .",
    "however this occurs at expense of loosing some of the local characteristics of the suppression .",
    "such a procedure can be efficient outside of the control radius of the ao system , where the speckle halo is relatively uniform ( @xcite ) .",
    "however when the speckles are bright and structured , optimizing the loci parameters in order to obtain the best spectral retrieval quickly becomes an intractable problem .",
    "in other words , when the minimization is ill - posed , pseudo - inverse routines aim at minimizing the speckle noise in the reduced image without considerations of the flux of a potential companion .",
    "whereas such an approach is adequate for faint companion detection , it can be problematic when quantifying the spectro - photometry of the discovered point sources .",
    "we now explore a modification of the loci that resolves these issues .",
    "`` damped loci '' relies on the same zonal approach as above .",
    "the modification we introduce resides in posing differently the inverse problem that defines the modal coefficients of the composite reference . instead of solely minimizing the residual least - squares fit between target frame and composite reference in the optimization zone",
    ", we constrain the possible combinations of coefficients over which the solution may be sought .",
    "we first impose positivity , @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , in order to avoid the pathological case where two adjacent coefficients are large in absolute value but of different signs .",
    "such a situation would lead to high spectral cross - talk from the companion flux at neighboring wavelengths . while this condition might appear too stringent",
    ", we show below that ensuring the positivity of all the reference coefficients allows us to introduce concisely in the minimization problem a penalty term that scales with opposite of the flux a companion . because we are interested in devising a reduction method that does not modify the spectro - photometry of a detected companion , the quality of the fit in the zone @xmath10 is of critical importance .",
    "ideally , even if the flux from a companion is present in the zone @xmath10 , we want the algorithm to only fit the stellar contribution in that zone , leaving the companion contribution unperturbed .",
    "_ in essence `` damped loci '' seeks composite references that are the result of a competition between minimizing the fit residual in the zone @xmath9 and maximizing it in the zone @xmath10 , under the constraint that all the composite coefficients are positive_. since the zone @xmath9 is much larger than @xmath10 , the minimization of its residual fit should prevail , and as a consequence the speckles will be subtracted in a way that preserves more of the companion flux than in classical loci implementations . + formally , the squared difference between @xmath12 and the composite reference integrated over @xmath10 can be written as : @xmath37 where we have replaced the @xmath9 subscript by the @xmath10 subscript for the matrix and vectors .",
    "when there is flux from a companion in the @xmath10 zone , we want this quantity to remain large while the residual in the zone @xmath9 is minimized .",
    "we can thus use an augmented cost function to write the optimization problem as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is multiplicative constant that allows us to include the flux preservation constraint in the loci minimization .",
    "the term @xmath40 is called the flux preservation penalty term and @xmath41 is the lagrange multiplier associated with this term .",
    "if one seeks to maximize the flux of a potential companion in the @xmath10 zone by minimizing @xmath42 , then @xmath39 ought to be positive . as a consequence ,",
    "this cost function is not positive definite , making the practical implementation of this optimization difficult .",
    "forcing positivity for the @xmath43 coefficients leads us to ensure the positivity of the second term in eq .",

    "even if @xmath53 happens to be negative , which means that the subtraction worked too well , the integrated square flux in the subtraction zone is dominated by the behavior of @xmath51 . when there is a companion then @xmath54 and has the same sign as @xmath51 .",
    "thus the integrated squared residual in the subtraction zone behaves as the opposite of the positive scalar @xmath55 . as a consequence we modify the augmented cost function shown in eq .",
    "[ eq::costlag ] , in order to avoid the use of a negative lagrange multiplier associated with the full quadratic form of the least - square fit in the @xmath10 zone .",
    "instead we choose to use @xmath56 in conjunction with a positive lagrange multiplier as a penalty term .",
    "since @xmath56 scales as the opposite of the residual fit in the @xmath10 zone , this modification re - formulates the problem of minimizing eq .",
    "[ eq::costlag ] in a tractable way .",

    "the reduction using synthetic sources becomes a very delicate exercise . a first avenue that can be explored when seeking to address this issue of faint companion spectral characterization is to devise a new class of algorithms that rely on priors about the speckle field ( e.g. @xcite ) or the spectral type of the companion ( e.g. spectral deconvolution as in @xcite ) .",
    "the solution proposed in the present manuscript , d - loci , focuses class of solution which assumes no priors about the quasi - static errors or the companion .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig::quantifyextraction ] demonstrates that d - loci is a robust approach when seeking to characterize the spectral features of a faint companion without any foreknowledge of its spectral type .",
    "indeed , the relative error using d - loci in conjunction with target frame masking is , for most separations and levels of contrast , half an order of magnitude smaller than the one obtained using dual masked classical loci .",
    "more importantly it yields sed uncertainties below the error - bar level of state of the art band - averaged photometric estimates ( @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is quite remarkable since it reduces the spectro - photometric uncertainties associated with observations with an ifs _ without _ field rotations to the level of observations carried out in a more favorable mode : adi ( @xmath123 ) and images integrated over several p1640 channels ( more photons from the companion ) . for the brightest synthetic companions tested here , the sed bias obtained using d - loci",
    "is of the order of the p1640 telluric calibration uncertainties .",
    "we also emphasize that such results are obtained without any iterations on loci parameter or underlying companion spectrum , and thus d - loci reduced images are a good first guess when seeking to obtain even higher spectro - photometric accuracy using iterative schemes .",
    "d - loci is thus an efficient method when one seeks to estimate the sed of a detected point source in p1640 data , without any prior knowledge about the spectral profile of the companion or about the chromaticity of the post coronagraphic speckles .",
    "this result ought to be carefully extrapolated to other instruments , in particular using similar tests based on synthetic companions .",
    "we expect however that such conclusions will stand when the raw contrast of direct imaging campaigns will improve , either using a real - time calibration system ( @xcite ) or advanced pre - observing calibration methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thus envision that the approach suggested in herein will be critical to the estimation of the physical parameters and atmospheric content of exo - planets detected via future direct imaging campaigns @xcite .",
    "in this paper we discuss an algorithm for point spread function subtraction in data acquired with an integral field spectrograph , that is efficient and accurate for retrieving the spectral content of faint companions located within several diffraction widths of a target star .",
    "a previous communication by @xcite used the newly functional project 1640 spectrograph , @xcite , as a laboratory to devise a robust method purely for off - axis faint source detection .",
    "this method relies on incorporating the spectral diversity inherent in ifs data into a locally optimized combination of images ( loci ) psf calibration scheme . in that paper , we reported h - band @xmath124 detection limits of @xmath125 in contrast , at 1 arcsec separation , in a @xmath8 min of exposure on an @xmath126 star . in the present paper , we expand upon the general loci scheme , and discuss the spectral characterization of already detected faint companions . we show that when loci is tuned to generate an _ aggressive _ composite calibration psf , the spectro - photometric content of the faint object is biased .",
    "it is affected by both signal depletion , which is common to all loci implementations , and by spectral cross - talk with neighboring wavelengths , which is specific to ifs imaging spectroscopy .",
    "herein , we introduced a new algorithm , `` damped loci '' ( d - loci ) that alleviates many of these shortcomings .",
    "we modified the formalism underlying loci psf calibration by introducing an augmented cost function that seeks to preserve the flux from the companion in question .",
    "we compared the efficiency of loci and d - loci for `` detectability '' , and found that both approaches performed similarly in the various test cases .",
    "we identified second order trends in the behavior of snr as a function of exposure time and loci parameters .",
    "such trends can be explained by the conditioning of the inverse problem that is at the heart of loci reduction , and have only marginal bearing on the conclusions pertaining to `` detectability '' discussed in @xcite . while d - loci clearly increases the signal of faint companions , it results in a noise floor that is shallower than that obtained in loci , and thus the detectability metric of both approaches is similar .",
    "we finally delved into the problem of spectral extraction .",
    "we first used synthetic companions to explore the behavior of classical loci reductions , implemented with a variety of binary weightings .",
    "our tests showed that a classical implementation of loci , with well chosen parameters as in @xcite , can be applied to companions slightly brighter than the speckles and yields an `` almost gray '' algorithmic throughput that yields a 10 percent error in sed estimates .",
    "in this regime we find the spectral fidelity can be improved by the use of a dual binary weighting when posing the psf reconstruction problem .",
    "since we expect telluric calibration errors below @xmath85 percent , the main source of errors in the spectro - photometric characterization of the discovered companions resides in bias within the reduction algorithm .",
    "moreover these biases increase rapidly as function of contrast , and when the companion is fainter than the speckles , the error in the sed estimate can be as large as 50 percents . using d - loci , in conjunction with a binary weighting of the target frames at the location of the companion ,",
    "consistently reduces this error by a factor of five : it lowers the algorithmic errors in the sed close to the levels imposed by the telluric calibration .",
    "translating these uncertainties in error bars on the estimates of the physical parameters of potentially discovered companions is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be illustrated in a future communication .",
    "all results are obtained using the project 1640 ifs data , but we fully expect that these results can be generalized to future high contrast imaging instruments operating in conjunction with advanced wavefront calibration techniques .",
    "these next generation instruments ( @xcite ) will operate at contrasts significantly higher than those possible with the current palao+p1640 configuration , and they will use integral field spectrographs as science cameras .",
    "accurate in - situ spectral characterization of faint exo - planets buried in the residual speckle fields of the long exposures will thus be a crucial component of upcoming campaigns .",

    "this corresponds to a short integration , @xmath163 seconds , and a small number of references to choose from in order to build the calibration psf : @xmath168 ( the actual value of @xmath16 varies as a function of angular separation , at the location of the injected synthetic sources a typical value is @xmath169 ) .",
    "we fix the geometry of the problem as follows : @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath170 .",
    "we then vary the size of the optimization zone by changing the value of @xmath33 from @xmath8 to @xmath171 , and thus study the behavior of both loci and d - loci in the over - constrained case since @xmath172 in these configurations .",
    "[ fig::snrbandonefilenachange20to300 ] illustrates how the average snr of the @xmath156 injected companions , integrated over the wavelength channels in both j and h bands , behaves in this configuration .",

    "the noise is estimated by computing the standard variation of the flux of a set of @xmath173 boxes surrounding the spiral of fake planets .",
    "each photometric box has the area of a psf core .",
    "since the purpose of this section is to illustrate general trends pertaining to detectability with loci and d - loci , we chose to only isolate two `` raw contrast '' levels : `` faint '' companions in j band and `` bright '' companions in h band , and only show how the averaged snr over the 11 companions behaves of for these two sub - groups . a detailed study , with synthetic sources of continuously decreasing brightness ,",
    "was carried out in @xcite in order to derive the sensitivity limit of p1640 . both loci and d - loci present the same overall level of performance with slight upward snr trend in both bands . in spite of having a penalty term that worsens the least - squares residual in the zone of the image where the psf is subtracted",
    ", d - loci performs nearly as well than regular loci in the over - constrained case .",
    "the small snr difference can be understood as follows : the noise suppression using pseudo - inverse methods is always more aggressive than when a damping term in introduced , and , in the over - constrained case , the likelihood of fitting companion flux with starlight is low .",
    "the upward trend in snr as a function of the area of the optimization zone means , for the data - set studied here , that the higher companion throughput ( e.g. larger signal ) achieved by using a larger @xmath33 slightly dominates the degradation of the noise due the fact that the composite calibration image is calculated over a less local area .",
    "+ we then study the case of an under - constrained problem , for which the number of reference frames is larger than the number of psf cores in the zone @xmath9 . to do so",
    ", we now fix the area of the optimization zone @xmath174 and vary the number of cubes reduced from @xmath4 to @xmath175 . according to our frame selection strategy , illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig::towersortillustration ] , using more data - cubes should increase the signal , since co - adding cubes increases the exposure time , and should also reduce the noise after loci , since @xmath16 increases with the number of cubes , thus making the subtraction more efficient .",
    "this means that we expect the snr to be an increasing function of @xmath16 .",
    "our result are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig::snrhbandna300fileschange1to15l ] .",
    "classical loci h - band results exhibit this behavior , with snr increasing from @xmath176 to @xmath156 , and yield better performances than d - loci reductions , for which the snr remains constant at @xmath176 .",
    "note that the rise in detectability does not scale as @xmath177 .",
    "this suggest that both our frame selection method ( that was chosen for computational cost purposes ) our loci parameters are not fully optimized for the synthetic companions injected .",
    "in the j - band , for which the contrast is less favorable , d - loci leads to constant detectability levels ( @xmath178 ) , while the performances of classical loci actually degrade with @xmath16 . in this configuration",
    "the likelihood of fitting companion flux is high , since there are more degrees of freedom than there are constraints , and thus the algorithmic throughput decreases when @xmath16 increases .",
    "when the companion is faint enough ( in the j - band ) then classical loci implementations that are under - constrained can reach a regime for which the companion s flux suppression is greater than the speckle noise attenuation .",
    "+ the cases illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig::snrbandonefilenachange20to300 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig::snrhbandna300fileschange1to15l ] first confirm that when seeking for faint companions using loci reduction methods one should optimize the algorithm parameters beforehand using synthetic sources .",
    "in particular they show how the conditioning of the correlation matrix , @xmath23 is a critical metric in this parameter search and that @xmath33 and @xmath16 ought to be adjusted so that the inverse problem is not under - constrained .",
    "this was carried out in the case of p1640 by @xcite .",
    "second , they show that d - loci detectability performances are close to the ones of classical loci .",
    "overall , the damping makes d - loci less sensitive to the conditioning of the inverse problem , and his flat response to variations of the algorithm parameters might be used in order to discriminate astronomical companions from speckles residuals in the case of marginal detection .",
