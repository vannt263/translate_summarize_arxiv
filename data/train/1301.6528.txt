    "recent research on semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has strongly focused on spin effects due to experimental breakthroughs in the initialization , control , and readout of spin states that have decoherence times up to milliseconds @xcite .",
    "consequently , qds are among the leading candidates for solid - state qubit design . on the other hand , studies on few - electron qds in strong magnetic fields",
    "have shown interesting similarities to partially or fully spin - polarized quantum hall ( qh ) states in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas @xcite ( 2deg ) .",
    "for example , the filling factor @xmath2 in the 2deg corresponds to a `` maximum - density droplet '' @xcite in a few - electron qd . as another example , the laughlin wave function @xcite  describing the filling factor @xmath3 state in the 2deg  was found to have @xmath4 overlap with the corresponding few - electron qd ( three vortices per electron ) @xcite .",
    "the analogy between the 2deg and qds applies further to the @xmath5 state , although a direct comparison is more complex .",
    "a. harju _ etal .",
    "_ @xcite showed that half - integer filling - factor states in qds correspond to a situation where the highest occupied landau level ( ll ) is fully spin - polarized , whereas the lower lls are spin - compensated .",
    "later on , the spin polarization of the highest ll is shown with three independent spin - blockade experiments @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these `` spin droplets '' were found to form only when the number of confined electrons exceeded @xmath6 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "spin droplets are collective states induced by a high density of states close to the fermi level that might lead to collective spin polarization . on the other hand , the correspondence between the highest - ll spin droplets and the candidates of the @xmath5 state in the 2deg , such as the pfaffian wave function ,",
    "was found to be ambiguous @xcite .",
    "although numerical studies have shown the appearance of spin droplets also in quantum rings @xcite , there is no systematic investigation on the _ stability _ of those states .",
    "this issue is of fundamental importance when the spin droplets will be applied in more general qh devices such as quantum point contacts @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on this aspect of stability and perform a thorough theoretical investigation on the formation of spin droplets in a realistic qh device starting from actual device geometry and parameters .",
    "our calculations show that the spin - droplet formation in a realistic device is very similar to that in `` idealized '' , i.e. , parabolically ( harmonically ) confined qds .",
    "thus , our finding confirms the high stability of spin droplets against geometric deformations .",
    "this might have significant consequences for the applicability of those states in , e.g. , spintronics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ methods ] we first perform self - consistent electrostatic calculations to extract the confining potential for electrons in a realistic qh device",
    ". then we present the many - electron hamiltonian and our spin - density - functional - theory @xcite ( sdft ) approach to calculations in the qh regime .",
    "our results for total energies , total and spin densities , and chemical potentials are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the paper is summarized in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "we consider a two layer @xmath7-si doped gaas / algaas heterostructure provided by goldman @xcite and visualized in figure [ figure1 ] . here , the crystal is grown on a gaas substrate and the 2deg is formed at the interface of the gaas / algaas heterostructure located 284 nm below the surface .",
    "the donor layers located 122 nm and 248 nm above the 2deg have surface densities @xmath8 m@xmath9 and @xmath10 m@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the geometry of the qd is shown on top of the gaas / algaas heterostructure in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the actual sample is obtained with etching 80 nm from the surface ( in the @xmath11 direction ) .",
    "the 2d dimensions on the @xmath12 plane are @xmath13 nm .        the qd sample is mapped on a matrix with @xmath14 mesh points .",
    "the confinement profile for the electrons trapped in the 2deg , i.e. , for our qd , is calculated by solving the poisson equation in 3d self - consistently within the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite . in the numerical calculation",
    "we apply a fourth - order nearest neighbor approximation and a 3d fourier transformation . here",
    "we apply open boundary conditions , since the heterostructure is embedded in a dielectric surrounding with a very small dielectric constant compared to the heterostructure .",
    "the obtained confining potential is shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the potential is not rotationally symmetric in contrast with the commonly used parabolic approximation for both lateral and vertical semiconductor qds @xcite .",
    "moreover , the shallow etching leads to a relatively smooth potential , although the slope of the confinement is still considerably steeper than in a parabolic qd .    in the following",
    "we may consider the obtained confining potential in figure [ figure2 ] as a trap for transported electrons forming a qd inside the device .",
    "alternatively , we can think that  by adjusting the gate and bias voltages  the 2deg inside the qd is emptied from conduction - band electrons one - by - one .",
    "it is important to note that in the following calculations we focus on such a qd - like system with a few dozen electrons instead of the bulk 2deg in the qh regime .",
    "our particular task is to investigate the effect of a relatively sharp and rotationally non - symmetric potential on the formation of spin - droplets in qds at @xmath1 .    .",
    "]      electrons in the qd are described by the hamiltonian @xmath15 +   \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon } \\sum_{i < j } \\frac{1}{{\\mathbf r}_{ij } } , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of electrons , @xmath17 is the confining potential obtained in the previous section ( figure [ figure2 ] ) , and @xmath18 is the vector potential of the homogeneous magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the qd plane .",
    "we consider the conventional effective - mass approximation @xcite with gaas material parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for the gyromagnetic ratio .    as we consider @xmath22 confined electrons , the many - electron hamiltonian is not solvable numerically exactly .",
    "the non - circular geometry sets additional limitations .",
    "hence , we use sdft @xcite that has been shown to produce reliable results when compared with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations @xcite . an explicit comparison between sdft and qmc results for spin - state energies",
    "can be found in fig .",
    "for the exchange and correlation we use the 2d local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) with the parametrization of attaccalite _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the correlation . in view of the previous works ,",
    "@xcite we rely on the computationally efficient lsda despite recent progress in the development of alternative and more accurate density functionals for 2d systems @xcite .",
    "our real - space sdft approach with the octopus code @xcite allows the use of the confining potential in figure [ figure2 ] as a direct input .",
    "we calculate the total energies and spin densities for different spin configurations , respectively , and determine the ground state as the solution with the lowest energy .",
    "it should be noted that in lack of rotational symmetry the angular momentum is not a good quantum number .",
    "however , the ( approximate ) angular momenta of the effective single - electron ( kohn - sham ) states enable us to determine the occupations of different lls ( see below ) .",
    "in the results presented below the magnetic - field range has been selected such that the regime at filling factors @xmath0 is covered . the filling factor in a qd",
    "can be approximated by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of electrons in the lowest ll @xcite .",
    "we point out that this approximation is valid only at @xmath25 , whereas otherwise a good estimate is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of flux quanta @xmath28 .",
    "detailed comparison between different definitions for the filling factor in confined systems is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the total energy can be written as a sum @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the ( kohn - sham ) kinetic energy , @xmath31 is the external confinement energy , @xmath32 is the classical electrostatic ( hartree ) interaction energy , and @xmath33 is the exchange - correlation energy accounting for quantum - mechanical interaction energy components beyond @xmath32 . in figure [ figure3 ]",
    "we show the total energies of different spin states @xmath34 as a function of the magnetic field for a 48-electron qd .",
    "the points of @xmath35 and @xmath36 according to the above definition are marked by dashed lines . at @xmath37 t the states with different @xmath34 are almost degenerate until a distinctive energy gap opens up between the higher and lower @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum ground - state spin is @xmath38 , and as @xmath39 is increased the polarization of the qd gradually decreases : at @xmath40 t the ground state has @xmath41 , and the unpolarized @xmath42 state is again very close in energy .    ) . ]",
    "overall , the behavior of @xmath43 in figure [ figure3 ] is very similar to that of parabolic qds @xcite . in the following",
    "we analyze the corresponding spin densities and chemical potentials in detail in order to characterize the expected spin - droplet formation .      in figure [ figure4 ]",
    "we show the total and spin densities in a 48-electron qd at @xmath45 t corresponding to @xmath44 .",
    "the ground - state total spin is @xmath41 as a slight deviation from an ideal @xmath46 state , which is fully spin - compensated , i.e. , the states in the lowest ll are doubly filled with spin - up and spin - down electrons @xcite , in our case , it seems clear in figure [ figure4](b ) that the polarized electrons are located close to the core of the qd in the second - lowest landau level ( 1ll ) .",
    "nevertheless , the total density is relatively flat in accordance with the @xmath46 state in a parabolic qd .",
    "we note that the rotational symmetry is broken due to the non - circular confining potential .",
    "the cross sections in the lower panel of figure [ figure4 ] are taken along a vertical cut across the 2d densities in the upper panel .",
    "t corresponding to @xmath44 .",
    "the cross sections in the lower panel are taken along a vertical cut across the 2d densities in the upper panel .",
    "the total spin is @xmath41 .",
    "( a - b ) total density , ( c - d ) spin - up density , ( e - f ) spin - down density . ]    figure [ figure5 ] shows the total and spin densities similarly to the previous case but now at @xmath47 t corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "the total spin is @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spin polarization is strongly concentrated close to the core of the qd .",
    "this is confirmed by sorting the kohn - sham states according to their spin and angular momenta .",
    "hence , it is clear that the ( eight ) polarized electrons occupy the 1ll .",
    "we may thus call this state as a spin droplet .",
    "its characteristics are strikingly similar to those in a parabolic qd . despite the non - circular potential , the density of the spin droplet in the core region [ figures [ figure5](c ) and ( d ) ] is very smooth .",
    "most likely , this is a consequence of the screening of the irregularities in the potential by the 0ll electrons , so that the 1ll with the spin droplet has a smooth surrounding potential . it might be expected that the spin droplet could survive in even more irregular geometries , i.e. , in the vicinity of a quantum point contact .",
    "this aspect of universality deserves more investigations .",
    "t corresponding to @xmath1 .",
    "the cross sections in the lower panel are taken along a vertical cut across the 2d densities in the upper panel .",
    "the total spin is @xmath38 .",
    "( a - b ) total density , ( c - d ) spin - up density , ( e - f ) spin - down density . ]",
    "an important aspect in the formation of a spin droplet is the sufficient @xmath16 for the phenomenon to occur . in parabolic qds spin droplets at @xmath48",
    "were found when the number of electrons was @xmath49 . according to our calculations",
    "there is no considerable change in the critical @xmath16 in a non - circular geometry , so that the droplet emerges at @xmath50 as well . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] the spin polarization of the highest occupied ll is a collective effect resulting from a high density of states close to the fermi energy .",
    "this is the case if ( i ) @xmath16 is sufficiently large and ( ii ) a proper fraction of the electrons occupy the highest ll ( for @xmath1 the highest ll is the second one ) .",
    "the effect resembles hund s rule : at the expense of kinetic energy , spin polarization saves exchange energy close to a point of degenerate states . here , with dozens of electrons involved in the process , the phenomenon is similar to the stoner effect @xcite , which predices the emergence of ferromagnetic alignment in a correlated electron system if the degeneracy is high close to the fermi level .",
    "finally we consider the chemical potentials to assess the signals that the formation of spin droplets in leave in spin - blockade oscillations .",
    "the chemical potential is defined as @xmath51 .",
    "here we consider @xmath52 by computing the energies of different spin states for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "for both systems , respectively , the lowest energy state ( ground - state ) was chosen to calculate the chemical potential .",
    "figure [ figure6 ] shows the chemical potential as a function of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the spin - droplet range .",
    "we find a clear `` plateau '' region at @xmath55 superimposed by distinctive sawtooth - like oscillations .",
    "the structure is similar to the coulomb - blockade peak oscillations measured in both lateral and vertical qds  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the qualitative features are similar to the previous sdft calculations for parabolic qds @xcite , although in this case we find more irregularities . in fact",
    ", the irregularities in @xmath56 resemble the experimental data ; it might be expected that in actual qds the impurities etc .",
    "induce similar effects found here for a non - circular qh device .",
    "in summary , we have studied the spin - droplet formation in realistic quantum hall devices in magnetic fields corresponding to filling factors @xmath48 .",
    "we carried out self - consistent electrostatic calculations for a gaas / algaas heterostructure with experimental parameters . in this way we obtained a confining potential for electrons that can be trapped inside the quantum dot .",
    "our spin - density - functional - theory studies for @xmath57 interacting electrons in the determined non - circular potential show that ( i ) spin polarization occurs at @xmath1 , ( ii ) polarized electrons are located at the core of the dot in the second landau level , ( iii ) the spin droplet is very smooth and thus similar to that in an ideal parabolic quantum dot , ( iv ) the critical @xmath16 for the formation of the spin droplet is not affected by having a realistic ( non - symmetric ) potential , and ( v ) the spin - droplet formation leaves a signal to the chemical potential that resembles the available experimental spin - blockade data .",
    "we hope that the present study encourages further experimental studies on the subject .",
    "in particular , it would be important to detect the spin - droplet _ directly _ in an experiment by appropriate spin - imaging methods .",
    "in addition , although the present study confirms the stability of the spin droplet in a non - circular geometry , the state is still to be found in a large system with @xmath58 confined electrons , where it can be assumed to be extremely stable .",
    "the ongoing experiments on quantum point contacts are likely to bring answers to these assumptions in near future , and they may open up the path for further applications .",
