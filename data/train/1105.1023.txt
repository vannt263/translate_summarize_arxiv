    "the bottom - right corner of @xmath122 depends on the colors of the facial neighbors in @xmath118 . however , there are two choices , we pick one .",
    "we jump to the next level to color @xmath124 .",
    "we want to repeat the idea of coloring clockwise and counterclockwise with the palindromic nonrepetitive sequence .",
    "we use the sequence for the bottom - right corner also , instead of using color @xmath103 .",
    "now the colors of the corners of @xmath122 are forbidden for the corners of @xmath124 .",
    "still there are two choices for each corner .",
    "therefore , we can select the colors to be different or to be the same , as we wish .",
    "we do it according to the sequence we fixed in the beginning , using a part of it of appropriate length .",
    "we permute the colors @xmath125 , if we need .    in the next step , we color the blank vertices of @xmath122 .",
    "the main idea behind the construction and coloring the vertices in concentric cycles comes now .",
    "any blank vertex needs to get a color different from its neighbors , and this is the only constraint .",
    "there is no danger of constructing a repetitive @xmath85-path . since every blank vertex is adjacent to two vertices with color @xmath103 , there are at most two forbidden colors .",
    "therefore , one of @xmath125 is available for each blank vertex .    from now on ,",
    "we can repeat the above steps for each pair of consecutive cycles .",
    "the only thing we have to check is the last or last two cycles .",
    "if @xmath116 is odd , then we finish without trouble .",
    "if @xmath116 is even , then we have to show that the last four vertices in the middle can be colored . for the penultimate cycle ,",
    "we use the sequence @xmath126 . here again , take into account the freedom of choice for the corner vertices and the permutation of the colors . now",
    "the last four vertices can be colored according to the next figure , which finishes the proof of the even case .",
    "the odd case is very similar .",
    "suppose that @xmath127 .",
    "we consider the concentric cycle cover @xmath128 again . here",
    "@xmath129 is a single vertex .",
    "we color @xmath118 with the fixed nonrepetitive palindromic sequence .",
    "the only exception is the bottom - right corner , which gets color @xmath103 .",
    "now we partly color @xmath122 , starting at the top - left corner , which is colored by @xmath103 . from that on ,",
    "we color every second vertex by @xmath103 and leave the rest blank . again",
    ", the bottom - right corner is left blank , exceptionally .",
    "now we color the @xmath130 bottom - right corner of @xmath122 and @xmath124 according to the next figure .",
    "we now jump to @xmath124 .",
    "there is one precolored vertex .",
    "anyway , we can use the fixed nonrepetitive palindromic sequence , possibly with permuted colors .",
    "now we turn back to @xmath122 and finish the coloring as before .",
    "these steps can be repeated , and we color the concentric cycles in pairs . at the end , the remaining single vertex is either colored by @xmath103 or @xmath26 depending on parity .",
    "both cases work without any trouble ."
