    "neutron stars are very interesting physical systems and their properties , such as masses and radii , can be derived from the equation of state ( eos ) of the nuclear medium contained in them . in carrying out such derivation",
    ", there is , however , a well - known difficulty , namely the eos is not fully known .",
    "determination of the eos for neutron stars is an important yet challenging undertaking .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , this topic has been extensively studied and much progress has been made . generally speaking ,",
    "there are two complementary approaches to determine the eos .",
    "one is to deduce it from heavy - ion collision experiments , and crucial information about the eos has already been obtained @xcite .",
    "another approach is to calculate the eos microscopically from a many - body theory .",
    "( see , e.g. @xcite and references quoted therein . )",
    "as is well - known , there are a number of difficulties in this approach . before discussing them ,",
    "let us first briefly outline the derivation of neutron - star properties from its eos .",
    "one starts from the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations @xmath9                    [ 1+\\frac{4\\pi r^3p(r)}{m(r)c^2 } ] }                      { [ 1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{rc^2 } ] } ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{dm(r)}{dr}&=&4\\pi r^2\\epsilon(r ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where _",
    "p_(_r _ ) is the pressure at radius _",
    "r _ and _ m_(_r _ ) is the gravitational mass inside _ r_. _",
    "g _ is the gravitational constant and @xmath10 is the energy density inclusive of the rest mass density .",
    "the solutions of these equations are obtained by integrating them out from the neutron - star center till its edge where _",
    "p _ is zero .",
    "( excellent pedagogical reviews on neutron stars and tov equations can be found in e.g. @xcite . ) in solving the above equations , an indispensable ingredient is clearly the nuclear matter eos for the energy density @xmath11 , _",
    "n _ being the medium density .",
    "as the density at the neutron star center is typically very high ( several times higher than normal nuclear saturation density of @xmath12 ) , we need to have the above eos over a wide range of densities , from very low to very high .    in the present work we shall calculate the nuclear eos directly from a fundamental nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction @xmath13 and",
    "then use it to calculate neutron star properties by way of the tov equations .",
    "there have been neutron - star calculations using a number of eoss , most of which empirically determined , and the mass - radius trajectories given by them are widely different from each other ( see , e.g. fig . 2 of @xcite ) . to determine the eos with less uncertainty would certainly be desirable .",
    "there are a number of different nn potential models such as the cdbonn @xcite , nijmegen @xcite , argonne v18 @xcite and bonna @xcite potentials .",
    "these potentials all possess strong short - range repulsions and to use them in many - body calculations one needs first take care of their short - range correlations by way of some renormalization methods .",
    "we shall use in the present work the recently developed renormalization group method which converts @xmath13 into an effective low - momentum nn interaction @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this interaction is its near uniqueness , in the sense that the @xmath0s derived from different realistic nn interactions are nearly the same .",
    "also @xmath0 is a smooth potential suitable for being directly used in many - body calculations .",
    "this @xmath0 will then be used to calculate the nuclear eos using a recently developed low - momentum ring - diagram approach @xcite , where the particle - particle hole - hole ( _ pphh _ ) ring diagrams of the eos are summed to all orders .",
    "the above procedures will be discussed in more detail later on .",
    "we shall also study the effects of brown - rho ( br ) scaling @xcite on neutron star properties . as discussed in @xcite , low - momentum ring diagram calculations using two - body nn interactions alone are not able to reproduce the empirical properties for symmetric nuclear matter ; the calculated energy per particle ( @xmath14 ) and saturation density ( @xmath15 ) are both too high compared with the empirical values of @xmath16 - 16 mev and @xmath17 .",
    "a main idea of the br scaling is that the masses of in - medium mesons are generally suppressed , because of their interactions with the background medium , compared with mesons in free space . as a result",
    ", the nn interaction in the nuclear medium can be significantly different from that in free space , particularly at high density .",
    "effects from such medium modifications have been found to be very helpful in reproducing the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) nuclear matter calculations have been conducted with and without br scaling  @xcite .",
    "in addition , br scaling has played an essential role in explaining the extremely long life time of @xmath18 @xmath1-decay @xcite . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the central density of neutron stars is typically rather high , @xmath19 or higher , @xmath15 being the saturation density of normal nuclear matter . at such high density , the effect of br scaling should be especially significant .",
    "neutron stars may provide an important test for br scaling .    in the following",
    ", we shall first describe in section ii the derivation of the low - momentum nn interaction @xmath0 , on which our ring - diagram eos will be based .",
    "our method for the all order summation of the ring diagrams will also be addressed .",
    "previously such summation has been carried out for neutron matter @xcite and for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite . in the present work we consider @xmath1-stable nuclear matter composed of neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons .",
    "thus we need to calculate ring diagrams for asymmetric nuclear matter whose neutron and proton fractions are different .",
    "an improved treatment for the angle averaged proton - neutron pauli exclusion operator will be discussed . in section",
    "iii we shall outline the br scaling for in - medium nn interactions .",
    "we shall discuss that the effect of br scaling can be satisfactorily simulated by an empirical three - body force of the skyrme type . in section iv , we shall present and discuss our results of neutron star calculations based on ring - diagram pure - neutron eoss , ring - diagram @xmath1-stable eoss consisted of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons , and the well - known eos of baym , pethick and sutherland ( bps ) @xcite for the nuclei crust of neutron stars .",
    "in our calculation of neutron star properties , we shall employ a nuclear eos derived microscopically from realistic nn potentials @xmath13 . such microscopic calculations would provide a test if it is possible to derive neutron star properties starting from an underlying nn interaction . in this section",
    ", we shall describe the methods for this derivation .",
    "a first step in this regard is to derive an effective low - momentum interaction @xmath0 by way of a renormalization procedure , the details of which have been described in @xcite . here",
    "we shall just briefly outline its main steps .",
    "it is generally believed that the low - energy properties of physical systems can be satisfactorily described by an effective theory confined within a low - energy ( or low - momentum ) model space @xcite .",
    "in addition , the high - momentum ( short range ) parts of various @xmath13 models are model dependent and rather uncertain @xcite .",
    "motivated by the above two considerations , the following low - momentum renormalization ( or model - space ) approach has been introduced .",
    "namely one employes a low - momentum model space where all particles have momentum less than a cut - off scale @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding renormalized effective nn interaction is @xmath0 , which is obtained by integrating out the @xmath21 momentum components of @xmath13 .",
    "this  integrating - out \" procedure is carried out by way of a _",
    "t_-matrix equivalence approach .",
    "we start from the full - space _ t_-matrix equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the principal - value integration .",
    "notice that in the above equation the intermediate state momentum @xmath24 is integrated from 0 to @xmath25 .",
    "we then define an effective low - momentum @xmath26-matrix by @xmath27 where the intermediate state momentum is integrated from 0 to @xmath20 , the momentum space cutoff .",
    "the low momentum interaction @xmath0 is then obtained from the above equations by requiring the @xmath26-matrix equivalence condition to hold , namely @xmath28 note that @xmath26 and @xmath29 are both half on energy shell , and they are equivalent within @xmath20 .",
    "the low - energy ( @xmath30 ) phase shifts of @xmath13 are preserved by @xmath0 and so is the deuteron binding energy . as we shall discuss later , for neutron star calculations we need to employ a cut - off scale of @xmath31 .    for many years , the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite and the dbhf @xcite methods were the primary framework for nuclear matter calculations .",
    "( dbhf is a relativistic generalization of bhf ) . in both bhf and dbhf",
    "the g - matrix interaction is employed .",
    "this g - matrix interaction is energy dependent .",
    "this energy dependence adds complications to calculations .",
    "in contrast , the above @xmath0 is energy independent which facilitates the calculation of nuclear eos .",
    "we shall use @xmath0 to calculate the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter of total density @xmath32 and asymmetric parameter @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote respectively the neutron and proton density and they are related to the respective fermi momentum by @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "the occupation factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 of eq.(7 ) are given by @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 ; also @xmath60 . again",
    "@xmath61 if @xmath62 is a neutron and @xmath52 if it is a proton .",

    "in addition , @xmath67 in eq.(6 ) means we sum over only those solutions of the rpa equation ( [ rpa ] ) which are dominated by hole - hole components as indicated by the normalization condition .",
    "note that there is a strength parameter @xmath68 in the above , and it is integrated from 0 to 1 .",

    "if there is no ground - state correlation ( i.e. @xmath72 is a closed fermi sea ) , we have @xmath73 and eq.(6 ) reduces to the hf result .",
    "clearly our eos includes effect of ground - state correlation generated by the all - order sum of _ pphh _ ring diagrams",
    ".    a computational aspect may be mentioned .",
    "we shall solve ring - diagram equations on the relative and center - of - mass ( rcm ) coordinates @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "( @xmath76 and @xmath77 . ) in so doing",

    "this operator is defined in the laboratory frame , with its value being either 1 or -1 ( for @xmath79 ring diagrams ) . in our calculation , however , we need _ q _ in the rcm coordinates .",
    "angle - average approximations are commonly used in nuclear matter calculations , and with them we can obtain angle - averaged @xmath80 . for symmetric nuclear matter ,",
    "detailed expressions for @xmath81 have been given , see eqs.(4.9 ) and ( 4.9a ) of @xcite .",
    "the results for this case , where the fermi surfaces for neutron and proton are equal , are already fairly complicated .",
    "derivation of the angle - averaged pauli operator for asymmetric nuclear matter has been worked out in @xcite .",
    "their derivation and results are both considerably more complicated than the symmetric case",
    ". it would be desirable if they can be simplified .",
    "we have found that this can be attained by way of a scale transformation .",
    "namely we introduce new s.p .",
    "neutron and proton momentum coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 on this new frame , the fermi surfaces for neutron and proton become equivalent , both being @xmath85 ; asymmetric nuclear matter can then be treated effectively as a symmetric one as far as the pauli operator is concerned .",
    "we have found that this transformation largely simplifies the derivation and calculation of the angle - averaged asymmetric pauli operator @xmath81 and will be employed in the present work .",
    "a main purpose of the present work is to study whether neutron star properties can be satisfactorily described by eos microscopically derived from nn interactions . before proceeding",
    ", it is important to also check if such eos can satisfactorily describe the properties of normal nuclear matter . the eos and nn interaction one uses for neutron star should also be applicable to normal nuclear matter . as discussed in @xcite , many - body calculations for normal nuclear matter",
    "using two - body nn interactions alone are generally not capable in reproducing empirical nuclear matter saturation properties . to remedy this shortcoming one needs to consider three - body forces and/or nn interactions with in - medium modifications @xcite .",
    "a central result of the br scaling is that the masses of mesons in nuclear medium are suppressed ( dropped ) compared to those in free space @xcite .",
    "nucleon - nucleon interactions are mediated by meson exchange , and clearly in - medium modifications of meson masses can significantly alter the nn interaction . these modifications could arise from the partial restoration of chiral symmetry at finite density / temperature or from traditional many - body effects . particularly important are the vector mesons , for which there is now evidence from both theory @xcite and experiment @xcite that the masses may decrease by approximately @xmath86 at normal nuclear matter density and zero temperature . for densities below that of nuclear matter",
    ", a linear approximation for the in - medium mass decrease has been suggested @xcite , namely @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the vector meson mass in - medium , @xmath32 is the local nuclear matter density and @xmath15 the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "_ c _ is a constant of value @xmath89 .",
    "br scaling has been found to be very important for nuclear matter saturation properties in the ring - diagram calculation of symmetric nuclear matter of @xcite .",
    "it is of interest that the effect of br scaling in nuclear matter can be well represented by an empirical skyrme three - body force .",
    "@xcite the skyrme force has been a widely used effective interaction in nuclear physics and it has been very successful in describing the properties of both finite nuclei and nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "it has both two - body and three - body terms , namely @xmath90 here @xmath91 is a momentum dependent zero - range interaction .",
    "its three - body term is also a zero - range interaction @xmath92 which is usually expressed as a density - dependent two - body interaction of the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the spin - exchange operator and @xmath95 . @xmath96 and @xmath97 are parameters determined by fitting certain experimental data .",
    "the general structure of @xmath98 is rather similar to the effective interactions based on effective field theories ( eft ) @xcite , with @xmath91 corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath99 to the eft three - body force .",
    "the skyrme three - body force , however , is much simpler than that in eft .",
    "when an eos is used to calculate neutron - star properties , it is important and perhaps necessary to first test if the eos can satisfactorily describe the properties of symmetric nuclear matter such as its energy per particle @xmath14 and saturation density @xmath15 . in principle",

    ", the choice of @xmath20 plays an important role . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the tensor force is important for nuclear saturation and therefore one should use a sufficiently large @xmath20 so that the tensor force is not integrated out during the derivation of @xmath0 .",
    "since the main momentum components of the tensor force has @xmath101 , one needs to use @xmath102 or larger .",
    "there is another consideration concerning the choice of @xmath20 .",
    "the density of neutron star interior is very high , several times larger than @xmath15 . to accommodate such high density ,",
    "it is necessary to use sufficiently large @xmath20 , suggesting a choice of @xmath20 larger than @xmath103 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a nice feature of @xmath0 is its near uniqueness : the @xmath0s derived from various different realistic nn potentials are practically identical to each other for @xmath104 , while for larger @xmath20s the resulting @xmath0s begin to have noticeable differences but are still similar to each other for @xmath20 up to about 3.5@xmath105 .",
    "this and the above considerations have led us to choose @xmath20 between @xmath106 and @xmath107 for our present study .",
    "the dependence of our results on the choice on @xmath20 will be discussed later on .",
    "we have carried out @xmath0 ring - diagram calculations for symmetric nuclear matter using several nn potentials ( cdbonn @xcite , nijmegen @xcite , argonne v18 @xcite and bonna @xcite ) with several values of @xmath20 ranging from 3.0 to 3.5@xmath105 . in fig .",
    "2 we present some representative results using cdbonn and bonna potentials , the results for other potentials and @xmath20s being very similar . as shown , the results for small densities are nearly independent of @xmath20 within the range considered . but for larger densities , the results have significant variations with @xmath20 and potentials , this being possibly a reflection of the different short - range repulsions contained in the potential models .",
    "a common feature of our results is , as displayed in the figure , that the calculated @xmath14 and saturation fermi momentum @xmath108 are all both too high compared with the empirical values ( @xmath109 - 16 mev and @xmath110 or @xmath1110.16@xmath112 ) .",
    "as discussed in section iii , the above situation can be largely improved by way of using a @xmath13 with br scaling . in",
    "@xcite authors have carried dbhf calculations for symmetric matter using a br - scaled bonnb nn potential , and they obtained results in good agreement with the empirical values , largely improved over those from the unscaled potential . in @xcite , ring - diagram eos calculations for symmetric nuclear matter have been performed using the nijmegen potential without and with br scaling , the latter giving highly improved results for nuclear matter saturation .",
    "it should be useful if the above effect on nuclear saturation from br scaling also holds for other nn potentials . to study this , we use in the present work a different potential , the bonna potential @xcite , for investigating the effect of br scaling on ring - diagram calculations for symmetric nuclear matter . in fig.3 ,",
    "results of such ring - diagram calculations for symmetric nuclear matter with and without br scaling are presented . for the scaled calculation ,",
    "the mesons ( @xmath113 ) of the bonna potential are slightly scaled according to eq.(11 ) with the choice of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these values are chosen so that the calculated @xmath14 and @xmath108 are in satisfactory agreement with the empirical values .",
    "the eos given by the above br - scaled potential is shown by the top curve of fig . 3 ( labelled as ` @xmath117 ' ) , and it has @xmath14=-15.3 mev and @xmath108=1.33 @xmath105 , in good agreement with the empirical values .",
    "in addition , it has compression modulus @xmath118=225 mev .",
    "the result using @xmath0 alone is also shown in fig.3 ( bottom curve ) .",
    "clearly br scaling is also important and helpful for the bonna potential in reproducing empirical nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "we shall now discuss if the above effect of br scaling can be simulated by an empirical three - body force of the skyrme type .",
    "it is generally agreed that the use of two - body force alone can not satisfactorily describe nuclear saturation , certain three - body forces are needed to ensure nuclear saturation @xcite .",
    "there are basic similarities between three - body force and br scaling . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a meson exchanged between two interacting nucleons .",
    "when this meson interacts with a third spectator nucleon , this process contributes to br scaling or equivalently it generates the three - body interaction . in @xcite , it was already found the ring - diagram results of br - scaled @xmath0 derived from the nijmegen potential can be well reproduced by the same calculation except the use of the interaction given by the sum of the @xmath0 plus the empirical three - body force ( tbf ) @xmath119 of eq.(13 ) .",

    ".    it should be noticed , however , for @xmath127 @xmath128 the curve for ` @xmath117 scaled @xmath0 ' rises much more rapidly ( more repulsive ) than the ` @xmath0 plus tbf ' one .",
    "the compression modulus given by them are also quite different , 225 versus 140 mev .",
    "these differences may be related to the linear br - scaling adopted in eq.(11 ) .",
    "this scaling is to be used for density less than @xmath129 . for density",
    "significantly larger than @xmath15 , such as in the interior of neutron star , this linear scaling is clearly not suitable .    to our knowledge , how to scale the mesons at high densities is still an open question @xcite . in the present work , we have considered two schemes for extending the br scaling to higher densities : one is the above skyrme - type extrapolation ; the other is an empirical modification where in the high density region a nonlinear scaling is assumed , namely @xmath130 with @xmath131 chosen empirically .",
    "the exponent @xmath131 is 1 in the linear br scaling of eq.(11 ) . as seen in fig .",
    "3 , the linear br - scaled eos agrees well with the ` @xmath0 plus tbf ' eos only in the low - density ( @xmath132 ) region , but not so for densities beyond .",
    "can a different choice of @xmath131 give better agreement for the high - density region ?",
    "as seen in fig . 3 , to obtain such better agreements we need to use a scaling with weaker density dependence than @xmath117 .",
    "thus we have considered @xmath133 , and have found that the eoss with @xmath131 near 1/3 have much improved agreements with the skyrme eos in the high density region .",
    "to illutrate , we have repeated the ` @xmath117 ' eos of fig .",
    "3 with only one change , namely changing @xmath131 from 1 to 0.3 .",
    "( the scaling parameters @xmath134s are not changed , for convenience of comparison . ) the new results , labelled as ` @xmath135 ' , are also presented in fig.3 . as seen , ` @xmath135 ' and ` @xmath0 plus tbf ' are nearly identical in a wide range of densities beyond @xmath129 .",
    "this is an interesting result , indicating that below @xmath129 the ` @xmath0 plus tbf ' eos corresponds to the linear @xmath117 scaled eos while beyond @xmath129 the nonlinear @xmath135 one .",
    "the @xmath117 and @xmath135 eoss have a small discontinuity ( in slope ) at @xmath15 , and the above eos with tbf is practically a continuous eos with good fitting to both . as we shall discuss later , the above three - body force",
    "is also important and desirable for neutron - star calculations involving much higher densities .",

    ", we obtain the pressure - density relation @xmath142 from the above two results , the eos @xmath143 is obtained .",
    "it is the eos @xmath143 which is used in the solution of the tov equations .    to accommodate the high densities in the interior of neutron stars ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath20=3.5 @xmath105 for our present neutron star calculation .",
    "our ring - diagram eos for neutron matter is then calculated using the interaction ( @xmath0 + @xmath119 ) with the parameter @xmath123= 2000 mev@xmath124 .",
    "note this value was determined for symmetric nuclear matter , as discussed in subsection a. is this @xmath96 also appropriate for the neutron matter eos ?",
    "we shall address this question here . in fig .",
    "5 we present results from the above neutron matter eos calculations for four interactions ( cdbonn , nijmegen , argonne v18 , bonna ) .",
    "it is seen that the eoss given by them are quite close to each other , giving a nearly unique neutron - matter eos .",
    "friedman and pandharipande ( fp ) @xcite have carried out variational many - body calculations for neutron matter eos using the two- and three - nucleon interactions @xmath144 and tni respectively , their eos results also shown in fig .",
    "brown @xcite has carried out extensive studies of neutron matter eos , and has found that the fp eos can be reproduced by the eos given by certain empirical skyrme effective interactions ( with both two- and three - body parts ) . as seen in fig 5 ,",
    "our results agree with the fp eos impressively well . for comparison , we present in fig . 5",
    "also the cdbonn eos without the inclusion of @xmath119 ( i.e. @xmath96=0 ) .",
    "it is represented by the dotted - line , and is much lower than the fp eos , particularly at high densities . for @xmath145",
    "the effect of @xmath119 is rather small , and in this density range one may calculate the eos using @xmath0 alone . clearly the inclusion of @xmath119 with @xmath96=2000 mev@xmath124 is essential for attaining the above good agreement between our eoss and the fp one .",
    "it is of interest that the @xmath96 value determined for symmetric nuclear matter turns out to be also appropriate for neutron matter .    in fig .",
    "6 , our results for the eos @xmath143 are presented , where the eoss given by various potentials are remarkably close to each other .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath119 is found to be also important here . as also shown in fig .",
    "6 , the eos given by @xmath0 alone ( without @xmath119 ) lies considerably higher than those with @xmath119 .",
    "it is of interest that for a given pressure , the inclusion of @xmath119 has large effect in reducing the energy density .",
    "we have chosen to use @xmath20= 3.5 @xmath105 , and this limits the highest pressure @xmath146 which can be provided by our ring - diagram eos calculation . as shown in the figure , the highest pressure there is about 650 mev/@xmath147 .",
    "but in neutron star calculation we need eos at higher pressure such as 1000 mev/@xmath147 ( or @xmath148 ) .",
    "the eos at such high pressure is indeed uncertain , and some model eos has to be employed . in the present work we shall adopt a polytrope approach ,",
    "namely we fit a section of the calculated eos near the maximum - pressure end by a polytrope @xmath149 and use this polytrope to determine the energy density for pressure beyond @xmath146 .",
    "( in our fitting the section is chosen as @xmath150 . )",
    "the polytrope eos has been widely and successfully used in neutron star calculations @xcite .",
    "in fact we have found that our calculated eos , especially the section near its high - pressure end , can be very accurately fitted by a polytrope . in table i we list the polytropes obtained from the above fitting for four nn interactions .",
    "it is seen that the four polytropes are close to each other .",
    "the exponent @xmath151 plays an important role in determining the neutron - star maximum mass .    .fitted polytrope @xmath152 for high pressure region .",
    "see text for other explanations . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : fitted eos ]    so far we have carried out microscopic calculations of neutron stars with the assumption that they are made of a homogeneous medium composed of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons .",
    "it is believed that the crust of neutron stars is not of such homogeneous medium ; it is `` nuclei crust '' where nucleons are clustering into nuclei @xcite . here",
    "we would like to make some estimates on the nuclei - crust corrections to our present calculations . in our estimates",
    ", we employ three different eoss for the outer- , inner - crust and core regions .",
    "these regions refer to the density regions @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively , with @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "@xmath157 is the transition density separating the inner crust and the homogeneous core , and several models have been employed to determine its value @xcite . for the outer - crust region we use the well - known bps nuclei - eos @xcite . for the core region ,",
    "our @xmath1-stable ring - diagram eos will be employed .",
    "the eos in the inner - crust region is somewhat uncertain , and so is the transition density separating the inner crust and core .",
    "we shall use in our calculations @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xcite to illustrate the effect of the nuclei crust .",
    "following @xcite , we use in the inner - crust region a polytropic eos , namely @xmath160 with the constants @xmath62 and @xmath161 determined by requiring a continuous matching of the three eoss at @xmath162 and @xmath157 .    in fig .",
    "11 , our results for the mass - radius trajectories using the above three eoss with @xmath163=0.04 and 0.05 @xmath112 , labelled @xmath1-crust@xmath164 and @xmath1-crust@xmath165 respectfully , are compared with the trajectory given by the @xmath1-stable alone ( namely @xmath163=0 ) .",
    "as seen , the effect from the nuclei - crust eos on the maximum neutron - star mass and its radius is rather small , merely increasing the maximum mass by @xmath166 and its radius @xmath167 km as compared with the @xmath1-alone ones .",
    "however , its effect is important in the low - mass large - radius region , significantly enhancing the neutron - star mass there .",
    "that the maximum mass is not significantly changed by the inclusion nuclei - crust eos is consistent with fig .",
    "8 which indicates the mass of maximum - mass neutron stars being confined predominantly in the core region .",
    "it may be mentioned that our ring - diagram eos is microscopically calculated from realistic nn interactions , while the crust eoss are not .",
    "so there are disparities between them",
    ". it would be useful and of much interest if the crust eoss can also be derived from realistic nn interactions using similar microscopic methods .",
    "further studies in this direction are needed .    in .",
    "fig.12 we present our mass - radius results using the above three eoss with @xmath163=0.04 @xmath112 .",
    "four nn potentials are employed , and they give similar trajectories , especially in the high- and low - mass regions . a corresponding comparison for the moment of inertia is presented in fig .",
    "13 ; again the results from the four potentials are similar . in table iii ,",
    "our results for the maximum neutron mass and its radius and moment of inertia using the above combined eoss are presented , and as seen the results for the maximum - mass neutron star given by the four potentials are indeed close to each other .",
    "it is also seen that the effect of the three - body force is quite important for @xmath168 and @xmath169 , as illustrated by the cdbonn case .",
    "we have performed neutron - star calculations based on three types of eoss : the pure - neutron ring - diagram , the @xmath1-stable @xmath170 ring - diagram and the bps nuclei - crust eos .",
    "the ring - diagram eoss , where the @xmath79 ring diagrams are summed to all orders , are microscopically derived using the low - momentum interaction @xmath0 obtained from four realistic nn potentials ( cdbonn , nijmegen , argonne v18 , bonna ) .",
    "we require that the eos used for neutron stars should give satisfactory saturation properties for symmetric nuclear matter , but this requirement is not met by our calculations using the above potentials as they are .",
    "satisfactory nuclear matter saturation properties can be attained by using the above potentials with the commonly used linear br scaling ( @xmath117 ) where the the masses of in - medium mesons are slightly suppressed compared with their masses in vacuum .",
    "but this linear scaling is not suitable for neutron stars ; the maximum mass of neutron star given by our @xmath117 ring - diagram calculation is @xmath171 which is not satisfactory .",
    "@xmath117 is suitable only for low densities ; it needs some extension so that it can be applied to the high densities inside the neutron star .",
    "we have used an extrapolation method for this extension , namely we add an empirical skyrme - type three - body force @xmath119 to @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that the eos given by this extrapolation agrees well with the eos obtained from linear @xmath117 scaling for low densities , but for high densities it agrees well with that from a nonlinear @xmath135 scaling .",
    "the eos using the above extrapolation gives satisfactory saturation properties for symmetric nuclear matter , and for neutron matter it agrees well with the fp eos for neutron matter .",
    "the effects from @xmath119 have been found to be both important and desirable . compared with the results given by the unscaled @xmath0",
    ", it increases the maximum mass of the neutron star and its radius and moment of inertia by @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 respectively .",
    "the proton fractions are found to be generally small ( @xmath175 ) , making our neutron - star results using the pure - neutron eos and those using the @xmath1-stable eos being nearly the same .",
    "we have estimated the effect from the nuclei - crust eoss by using a combination of three eoss : the bps eos for the outer crust , a fitted polytropic eos for the inner crust and our @xmath1-stable ring - diagram eos for the core region .",
    "the effect from the nuclei - crust eoss on the maximum neutron - star mass and its radius is found to be rather small , as compared with those given by the calculation where the @xmath1-stable eos is used throughout .",
    "however , its effect is important in the low - mass large - radius region , significantly enhancing the neutron - star mass there .",
    "using the above combined three eoss , our results for neutron star s maximum mass and its radius and moment of inertia are , respectively , @xmath6 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , all in good agreement with accepted values .    how to extend the br scaling to high densities is still an open question .",
    "although we have obtained satisfactory results by using a nonlinear scaling for the high - density region , or equivalently a skyrme - type three - body force , for the extension , it would still be certainly useful and interesting to explore other ways for doing so .",
    "further studies in this direction would be very helpful in determining the medium dependent modifications to the nn potentials in the high - density region .",
