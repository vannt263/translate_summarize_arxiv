    "the quantum few - body problem is important for investigating physical processes at practically all possible length and energy scales .",
    "for instance , three - body models can be employed for describing nuclear reactions  @xcite , electron- and positron - atom collisions  @xcite , and chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "the developments of the last decade demonstrated the importance of three - body processes for understanding the dynamics of ultra - cold gases  @xcite . an ability to solve a few - body problem directly would also be beneficial to theorists for testing , for instance , effective - field theories  @xcite .",
    "the three - body problem , however , has sufficient intrinsic complexity that it often inhibits or prevents non - experts in few - body calculations from considering realistic three - body models and from employing physically correct representations  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a standard , easily operable and rigorously constructed tool for three - body calculations will be beneficial for a broad physical community .",
    "such a tool should be tested independently to ensure its usability and applicability .",
    "this work is a result of a collaboration between the authors of this tool , developed at the university of kentucky , and a research group in jinr performing independent tests .    in the following sections we describe the equations being solved and report the results of the tests we have performed",
    "the three - body code being tested is based on solving faddeev equations in configuration space .",
    "the complete and mathematically rigorous theory of faddeev equations can be found in books on the topic  @xcite .",
    "here we only sketch out the gross features important for understanding and using the code .",
    "we start by describing the physical model from the three - body hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the kinetic energy of the three particles , @xmath3 is the interaction potential acting in the pair @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a short - range three - body interaction .",
    "( in the following description the latter will be omitted only for simplicity .",
    "taking into account the three - body interactions , however , does not produce any practical or principal difficulties . ) the configuration space of the three particles is described in terms of 3 sets of jacobi coordinates @xmath6 the set of coordinates @xmath4 describes a partitioning of the three particles into a pair @xmath7 and a separate particle @xmath4 .",
    "faddeev decomposition represents the wave function @xmath8 in terms of a sum over all possible partitioning of the three - body system @xmath9 faddeev components , @xmath10 , satisfy the following set of equations  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are mass - weighted jacobi coordinates , @xmath14 is the interaction potential in the @xmath4-th pair and @xmath15 is the total energy of the system .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the exact wave function of the three body system can be uniquely constructed from the faddeev components by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) .    the equations in six - dimensional space",
    "can hardly be solved directly , and some partial analysis is necessary .",
    "we consider the states with zero total angular momentum .",
    "the angular degrees of freedom corresponding to collective rotation of the three - body system can be separated @xcite and the kinetic energy operator reduces to @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are so called intrinsic coordinates @xmath20 \\ \\ .\\ ] ] in the case of identical bosons faddeev components take identical functional form , which makes it possible to reduce the system of three equations ( [ eq : faddeev ] ) to one equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are @xmath26 assuming that in each two - body subsystem only one bound state exists , we can write the asymptotic boundary conditions for the faddeev component @xmath27 as follows @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the wave function of the two - body subsystem bound state , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the two - body bound state energy , and @xmath33 the energy of the three - body system . for three - body bound",
    "states the first term corresponds to virtual decay into a particle and a two - body bound system , while the second term corresponds to a virtual decay with an amplitude @xmath34 into three single particles .",
    "the term corresponding to the latter configuration can generally be neglected for the states below the three - body threshold .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently large distances @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the asymptotic boundary conditions for the faddeev component are @xmath37 for bound state calculations dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions can also be employed .",
    "the important property of the faddeev components which makes them suitable for numerical solution is their simple asymptotic form .",
    "for instance , each of the faddeev components holds only bound states of the corresponding two - body subsystem . in this respect",
    "the @xmath12 coordinate is the internal coordinate of the corresponding two - body cluster and the @xmath13 coordinate plays the role of a reaction coordinate for all the states below the 3-body ( break - up ) threshold .",
    "this simple physical meaning of the coordinates suggest a natural requirement for discretizing the corresponding degrees of freedom : the discrete analogs of the @xmath12 coordinate should reproduce the spectrum of the @xmath4-th cluster correctly , and discrete analogs of the @xmath13 coordinate must describe the scattering states reasonably well .",
    "these necessary requirements are easy to check prior to performing actual calculations , and they also provide a solid ground for a reasonable degree of automation for choosing the parameters of the numerical scheme . another advantage of the faddeev equations is the asymptotic decoupling of the components .",
    "the right - hand side of the equation  ( [ eq : faddeev ] ) is , roughly speaking , exponentially small if the third particle is at larger distance than the typical size of the two - body bound state .",
    "this means that at longer distances @xmath38 the faddeev components rapidly decouple , and calculations can be performed in the regions as small as the size of the largest two - body subsystem bound state .",
    "the advantages of the faddeev approach can be exploited even further when dealing with short - range interactions ; i.e. assuming that the potentials @xmath14 are zero ( or negligible ) outside the region @xmath39 . to clarify this ,",
    "consider the component @xmath10 in the asymptotic region @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where it satisfies a schrdinger equation with the corresponding channel hamiltonian @xmath42 where @xmath2 is the free three - body hamiltonian .",
    "this property of @xmath10 suggests that , rather than calculate @xmath10 directly , we instead calculate @xmath43 ( eq . [ taucomp ] ) , which is better localized in configuration space @xmath44 these @xmath43 are non - zero only for small @xmath45 and small @xmath46 . accordingly , they are localized to a region that can be _ much smaller than the typical size of a two - body bound state_. this feature leads to substantial computational savings  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43 satisfy the following integral equations @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the resolvents of the corresponding channel hamiltonians . since @xmath49 ,",
    "the @xmath43 are more suitable for numerical approximation than the original faddeev components .",
    "furthermore , if the equation is being solved using an iterative technique , then no explicit representation for the integral operators @xmath48 is required . in this case",
    "we only need to calculate the action of the integral operator on the @xmath43 , which can be done with high computational efficiency by numerically solving the corresponding differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we call this computational scheme a localized component method ( lcm ) .",
    "in order to construct a discrete analogue of the system of equations ( [ eq : lcm ] ) we employ quintic hermite splines together with the orthogonal collocations method  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the procedure is given in @xcite .",
    "this high - order method guarantees fast convergence with respect to the number of grid points , sparse matrix structure for the discrete analog of the equation  ( [ eq : faddeev ] ) , and fast calculation of matrix elements that makes it possible to avoid storing big matrices in computer memory .",
    "the code is written in java and consists of two parts .",
    "the first part is a configurator that simplifies composing the necessary configuration files .",
    "the configurator allows the user to set masses of the interacting atoms , to specify identical particles in the system , to choose a potential model , to set the cutoff distances @xmath35 and @xmath36 and to set the number of grid points to be employed in the calculation .",
    "it also generates a mesh with @xmath50-optimal point distribution which ensures the best possible approximation of the three - body wave function in the asymptotic region . in fig .",
    "[ fig : screenshot ] we show an example of the configurator screenshot .    ]",
    "the second part is the three - body computational kernel based on the lcm approach .",
    "the kernel is currently capable of three - body calculations below the three - body threshold with a limitation of no more than one two - body bound state contributing to each asymptotic channel .",
    "this includes bound states , elastic scattering and chemical reactions below the first vibrational excitation threshold .",
    "typical computational time can take from minutes to hours , depending on the physical system and the size of the grid .",
    "we apply the code to the calculation of binding energies of the helium trimer @xmath51he@xmath0 three - atomic system , to verify that we can reproduce the known calculated properties of helium trimer ground and excited states .",
    "this system is very particular about the approach being used , as the trimer binding energy is extremely small and a large volume of the configuration space should be treated , but the interaction features very strong repulsion at short distances , which requires very precise numerical methods to be used .",
    "experimentally , helium dimers have been observed for the first time in 1993 by the minnesota group  @xcite , and in 1994 by schllkopf and toennies @xcite .",
    "later on , grisenti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured a bond length of @xmath52  for @xmath51he@xmath53 , which indicates that this dimer is the largest known diatomic molecular ground state .",
    "based on this measurement they estimated a scattering length of @xmath54  and a dimer energy of @xmath55 mk @xcite . in the latter investigation  @xcite the trimer pair distance is found to be @xmath56 nm in agreement with theoretical predictions for the ground state .",
    "many theoretical calculations of these systems were performed for various interatomic potentials @xcite .",
    "variational @xcite , hyperspherical @xcite and faddeev techniques @xcite have been employed in this context . it was found that the helium trimer has two bound states of total angular momentum zero : a ground state of about @xmath57 mk and an excited state of efimov - type of about @xmath58 mk .",
    "experimentally this efimov - type@xcite excited state has not yet been observed ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the year 2006 is noticeable due the first convincing experimental evidence for the efimov effect in an ultracold gas of caesium atoms @xcite .    in present calculations we employed the code based on the faddeev differential equations ( [ h00 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ apprbc ] ) . as he - he interaction we used the semi - empirical lm2m2 potential  @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath59  @xmath60 for the mass of the @xmath51he atom and @xmath61k@xmath62 , unlike many three - body calculations , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , where a rounded value of the coefficient has been used .",
    "investigation of the bound state energy convergence with respect to the number of grid points demonstrates that even a moderate number of points in variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 is sufficient to get up to six accurate figures for the energy of the ground state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : converg ] ) .",
    ".dimer energy @xmath64 , @xmath51he@xmath65he scattering length @xmath66 , bond length @xmath67 and root mean square radius @xmath68 for the potentials used , as compared to the experimental values of ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath51he dimer binding energies , @xmath51he@xmath51he scattering lengths and mean values of the radius @xmath67 and @xmath68 obtained with the lm2m2 potential  @xcite are shown in table [ tabledimerlen ] in comparison with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "all the values agree with an experimental estimation of ref.@xcite within quoted errors .",
    "the scattering length @xmath69 of the system is bigger than the range of the potential by an order of magnitude .",
    "all these features characterize the helium dimer as the weakest , as well as the biggest , diatomic molecule found so far .",
    "due to the fact that the energy of the dimer is so small , one should expect that the @xmath70 trimer indeed possesses the theoretically predicted state of the efimov type ( see , @xcite ) .    in table",
    "[ tabletrimer ] the results of trimer binding energies calculations obtained with lm2m2 potential are summarized .",
    "the binding energies of the @xmath51he trimer ground ( @xmath70 ) and exited ( @xmath71 ) states are presented .",
    "these results demonstrate good agreement between different methods and show that the code competes well even against variational methods .",
    "it should be mentioned that the energy estimates obtained with the code are non - variational , and further variational improvements of the results are possible .",
