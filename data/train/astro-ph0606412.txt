    "the simplest weak interaction process that could proceed in the core of a neutron star is the so - called direct urca ( or _ durca _ ) process , which consists of the two successive reactions , @xmath0 decay and capture . @xmath6",
    "it is the most powerful of the neutrino processes potentially leading to the cooling of the neutron star .",
    "however , these reactions are allowed only if each of the fermi momenta of neutrons ( @xmath7 ) , protons ( @xmath8 ) , and electrons ( @xmath9 ) is smaller than the sum of the two others ( triangle condition ) .",
    "this implies a ( highly uncertain ) threshold in the matter density for the direct urca processes .",
    "another reaction , which overcomes this restriction , is the so - called modified urca ( or _ murca _ ) process , which involves an additional spectator nucleon : @xmath10 where the additional nucleon @xmath11 can be either a neutron or a proton .",
    "the matter is transparent to neutrinos , which escape freely , transporting their energy away from the star .",
    "furthermore , these two reactions bring nucleons into the state of beta ( or chemical ) equilibrium , which determines the concentration of neutrons and protons .",
    "the beta equilibrium condition @xmath12 involving the chemical potentials of the constituent particles implies the equality of @xmath13 and @xmath14 emission rates ( or the net reaction rate set equal to zero ) .",
    "if a slight departure from equilibrium @xmath15 is produced by any external or macroscopic phenomenon that changes the density of a fluid element , one of the two reactions in equations ( [ beta ] ) or ( [ murca ] ) becomes more intense and changes the fraction of protons and neutrons towards the new equilibrium values ( le chtelier s principle ) . in the subsequent evolution",
    ", the chemical imbalance affects the stellar interior temperature @xmath2 by increasing the phase space available to the products of the neutrino - emitting reactions and by converting chemical energy into thermal energy , and the temperature affects the chemical imbalance by also determining the rate at which reactions proceed .",
    "several authors have investigated external processes that induce non - equilibrium @xmath0 reactions , such as radial pulsation @xcite , gravitational collapse @xcite , a changing rotation rate @xcite , and a hypothetical time - variation of the gravitational constant @xcite . however",
    ", none of these has considered an adequate model for the effects of the likely cooper pairing ( superfluidity ) of nucleons ( see @xcite for a very rough estimate of their likely importance ) .",
    "two basic rates are relevant in order to follow the coupled evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath16 ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) : the total ( neutrino and antineutrino ) emissivity ( energy per unit volume per unit time ) , @xmath17 , and the net reaction rate ( number of reactions or emitted lepton number per unit volume per unit time ) , @xmath18 .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the effect of nucleon superfluidity on the net reaction rates , @xmath19 , calculating superfluid reduction factors for the direct and modified urca processes by means of sophisticated numerical methods",
    ". nevertheless , they did not evaluate the total emissivity of neutrinos , @xmath20 , which is also required in order to compute the eventual time - evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath16 .    in this work",
    ", we present a curious relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , both considered as functions of the chemical imbalance parameter @xmath23 , that holds even in the superfluid case : @xmath24 the advantage of this relation is that , having computed one of the functions numerically ( as done by @xcite ) , the other is obtained very easily , saving time in the calculation .    in the non - superfluid case , @xcite calculated @xmath21 and @xmath22 analytically . for durca processes , @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a dimensionless parameter , and",
    "@xmath28 is the equilibrium emissivity . for murca processes , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 ( see @xcite for precise estimates ) .",
    "in these two pairs of polynomial expressions , it is easy to verify our proposed relation ( eq .",
    "[ 3sig ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that it is valid beyond these simple cases , encompassing , for example , the cases of superfluid neutrons and/or protons .",
    "a brief and clear discussion of superfluidity in neutron star was given by @xcite , and a rigorous and deep analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "we now show that equation ( [ 3sig ] ) holds regardless of the nucleons being superfluid or not . along this paper",
    "we will use natural units , with @xmath32 .",
    "+ we express the phase space factors as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the particle energy , , where @xmath35 denotes the fermi momenta .",
    "the cooper pairing occurring around the fermi surfaces , allows us to approximate @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the fermi velocity and effective particle mass for superfluid nucleons , respectively . ] and @xmath39 is the density of states and @xmath40 is the solid angle element in the direction of @xmath41 . in order to show the generality of our derivation , we left the electron and nucleon densities of states . ]",
    "expressed implicitly in the following calculation .",
    "for neutrinos , we will need the explicit expression @xmath42 and we may assume neutrino isotropy , so @xmath43    in the interior of the neutron star , the temperature is much smaller than the fermi temperature .",
    "on the other hand , the neutrino momentum is proportional to the temperature of the star , and the other momenta are essentially their respective fermi momenta ( degenerate matter ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , and neglect @xmath46 in the dirac delta function of momentum",
    ". this approach will allow us to integrate more easily over the orientation of the neutrino momentum .",
    "using the following dimensionless variables : @xmath47 the total emissivity @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath49 ( @xcite , eq .",
    "115 ) , where @xmath50 is the squared transition amplitude for the @xmath0 decay and capture processes , averaged over initial and summed over final spin states ; furthermore averaged over the direction of the neutrino momentum , this results in a roughly constant value , which can be taken out of the integrals ( for more details see @xcite or @xcite ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are the fermi weak interaction constant , the cabibbo angle ( @xmath55 ) , and the gamow - teller axial vector coupling constant , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath56 contains the integrals over the orientations of the particle momenta @xmath57 and @xmath58 integral includes the integrations over dimensionless particle energies : @xmath59 @xmath60,\\ ] ] where the @xmath61 s ( for @xmath62 ) are the fermi - dirac distributions , @xmath63 , for some of whose arguments the signs have been redefined when using the symmetry property @xmath64 .",
    "the functions @xmath65 are approximately symmetric around @xmath66 for all relevant cases .",
    "when considering situations with neutron or proton superfluidity , the possible anisotropy of gaps ( appearing in the density of states function ) in the expression @xmath58 should be taken into account in the preceding @xmath56 integration .    similarly , the net reaction rate is @xmath67 where @xmath68 @xmath69.\\ ] ] note that the integral now contains only two powers of @xmath70 .",
    "the total emissivity ( given by eq .",
    "[ [ etot ] ] ) depends on the chemical imbalance @xmath16 only through the dimensionless non - equilibrium parameter @xmath71 contained in @xmath58 , in the argument of the dirac delta function . in order to calculate the derivative @xmath72",
    ", we define @xmath73 so we can rewrite the derivative @xmath74= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_\\nu}\\left[-\\delta(z_+)\\!-\\!\\delta(z_-)\\right]\\ ] ] and do an integral by parts in order to obtain the derivative of equation ( [ i- ] ) and vanishes in both limits . ] : @xmath75=3\\widehat{i}_+.\\ ] ] thus , in a straightforward way , we reach the proposed relation ( eq .",
    "[ 3sig ] ) : @xmath76    it is straightforward to verify that an analogous derivation can be made for modified urca processes .",
    "as a useful application of the proposed relation , we analyze the balance between heating and cooling due to @xmath0 processes .    the net local heating rate can be written as @xmath77 where the first term is the rate of dissipation of chemical energy , and the second is the energy loss rate due to neutrino emission . using our relation ( eq .",
    "[ 3sig ] ) , which links @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 if @xmath78 increases faster than @xmath81 , the net heating is positive ( @xmath82 ) , and viceversa .",
    "the net heating rate can also be written as @xmath83 without cooper pairing , and in the limiting case of @xmath84 , we know that @xmath85 for durca processes , and @xmath86 for murca processes .",
    "for these cases , we easily reobtain that the total energy released , @xmath87 , is distributed in fixed fractions among internal heating , @xmath88 , and neutrino emission , as @xmath89 for durca , and @xmath90 , @xmath91 for murca processes @xcite .",
    "we have proven a simple , general relationship ( eq .  [ 3sig ] ) between the main rates characterizing non - equilibrium @xmath0 processes in both superfluid and non - superfluid neutron star matter .",
    "this relation could simplify the evaluation of these quantities in superfluid neutron star models , complementing numerical calculations such as those of @xcite .",
