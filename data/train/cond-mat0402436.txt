    "the vortex state in type - ii superconductors is a paradigm for studying the effect of quenched disorder in condensed matter . over the last decade ,",
    "much of the effort has been spent on characterizing the various phases of the vortex state as a function of the magnetic field @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath4 . for @xmath5 vortex system@xcite",
    ", three phases have been identified unambiguously  @xcite : the bragg glass ( bg ) with quasi - long range order , the amorphous vortex glass ( vg ) , and the vortex liquid ( vl ) .",
    "the vg and the vl are distinguished by their superconducting and ohmic responses , respectively .",
    "experiments in high-@xmath6 superconductors suggest that the bg phase appears in the low-@xmath1 and low-@xmath4 region whereas the vg phase occupies the high-@xmath1 and low-@xmath4 region of the @xmath1-@xmath4 phase diagram .",
    "the vl phase appears close to the upper critical field @xmath7 .",
    "the first detailed calculation of the real space structure of the vortex lattice in the presence of quenched impurities@xcite was carried out by larkin and ovchinnikov@xcite ( lo ) .",
    "the lo theory assumes that for the weak pinning , the vortex lattice is coherently pinned within a volume @xmath8 . beyond @xmath8 ,",
    "the effect of impurities dominates and the long range positional order is lost .",
    "it was further proposed that when the vortex displacement becomes of the order of lattice constant , topological defects ( dislocations in @xmath9 and dislocation loops in @xmath10 ) are generated@xcite .",
    "later calculations by giamarchi and le doussal  @xcite ( gld ) showed that the lo calculation overestimates the effect of impurities at large distances and the vortex displacement grows only logarithmically ( for @xmath5 vortex system ) .",
    "the positional correlation decays as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a non - universal exponent@xcite .",
    "the quasi - long range @xmath13 leads to a topologically ordered phase ( the bragg glass ) , which is stable with respect to the formation of defects@xcite . on increasing @xmath1 ( or the pinning strength ) , the lo and gld theories predict proliferation of topological defects , thus forming the vg at high fields@xcite .",
    "the transition between the bg and the high field vg is predicted to be of first - order@xcite .",
    "the bg also undergoes a melting transition to vl on increasing @xmath4 .    in @xmath9 ,",
    "the bg phase is unstable to the formation of dislocations and the positional quasi - long range order is destroyed@xcite .",
    "however , for weak pinning and at low temperatures , the unbound dislocations appear only at large length scale @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the `` random manifold '' length scale and is the distance at which positional correlation begins to decay@xcite . on length scales shorter than @xmath16 , the topologically ordered lattice forms a quasi - bragg glass ( qbg ) .",
    "such a qbg shows an exponentially sharp crossover to the high temperature vl phase@xcite , reminiscent of the `` melting '' transition of the pure system .",
    "a similar exponential crossover was proposed between the qbg and the vg phase as a function of @xmath1 , or pinning strength .",
    "the real space structure of the vortex system has been studied used neutron diffraction@xcite and bitter decoration of vortices@xcite .",
    "the latter technique allows direct visualization of the large scale structure of the configuration and hence enables one to analyze the role of topological defects on the decay of translational order .",
    "recent decoration experiments  @xcite of nbse@xmath17 have raised some important issues concerning the nature of the disordered phase .",

    "_ showed that the spatial configuration of vortices does not show any significant difference between the ordered and the disordered vortex phases identified in ref.@xcite .",
    "more importantly , both phases were found to be polycrystalline with dislocations forming grain boundaries . within each grain",
    ", the lattice shows significant bond orientational order .",
    "this is in contrast to the naive theoretical picture of the ordered phase which expects a dislocation - free configuration , and the disordered phase in which the distribution of the dislocations is expected to be homogeneous .    in this paper , we analyze in detail the real space configuration of the disordered phase using numerical simulation of a @xmath0 vortex system at @xmath18 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath1 is varied over a wide range for various values of the pinning strength @xmath3 .",
    "the real space configuration shows that for the intermediate field range , the system shows inhomogeneous disordering .",
    "the majority of the dislocations are confined to the grain boundaries which forms the domain wall between regions of ordered lattice .",
    "the domain size and its distribution is dependent on @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "we refer the intermediate fields in which the vortex state is quasi - ordered as the domain regime ( dr ) .",
    "the dr is distinct from the amorphous regime at low - fields and high - fields , where the defects appear at a length scale @xmath19 ( lattice constant ) and its distribution is homogeneous over the entire system .",
    "analysis of the real space images suggests domain wall roughening as a possible mechanism for the crossover between the dr and the high - fields amorphous regime .",
    "we also obtained the roughening exponent @xmath20 of the vortex lattice in the domain regime .",
    "finite temperature simulation shows that the domain regime undergoes a sharp crossover to the high-@xmath4 liquid phase , which is reminiscent of the thermal melting in the pure vortex system .",

    "this is referred as the current annealing ( ca ) method . in the second method ,",
    "the conventional thermal annealing ( ta ) is applied wherein the temperature @xmath4 is reduced to 0 in small steps from the high temperature liquid phase ( also known as simulated annealing ) .",

    "the rm regime is expected to disappear for @xmath198 , and have been shown in the case of @xmath5 system@xcite .",
    "an interesting outcome of the above analysis of @xmath124 is that the average domain size @xmath199 , and hence , the collective pinning theory can not account for the appearance of domains in the intermediate fields .",
    "the asymptotic regime in @xmath124 suggests that the qbg theory is qualitatively correct . within the qbg theory ,",
    "the distribution of dislocations beyond the length scale @xmath161 is expected to be homogeneous , unlike the grain boundary formation observed in our simulation .",
    "one possible way to account for the grain boundary formation is to consider the long range interaction between the dislocations .",
    "since the interaction between the dislocations is anisotropic , for some values of dislocation density , the grain boundaries may lead to a lower energy state .",
    "this is also supported from a recent work on dipole systems@xcite . at low densities , the dipoles",
    "exhibit a gaseous phase , and their distribution is roughly homogeneous . at higher densities",
    "the phase is characterized by dipoles forming chains or strings .",
    "since the dislocations of the vortex lattice are in fact dipoles of disclinations , these results are quite analogous to our identification of a domain regime in the vortex matter .",
    "the three field regimes discussed in the context of the real space configuration can also be inferred from the behavior of the defect density @xmath200 .",
    "fig.7(a ) shows @xmath200 for @xmath81 and @xmath62 . the behavior for smaller system sizes ( @xmath201=800 - 1200 ) is also shown on the same plot .",
    "the @xmath200 increases linearly in the low field amorphous regime . above a crossover field @xmath202 , @xmath200 flattens and",

    "@xmath206 , which is much smaller than even @xmath137 and does not correspond to any feature in the real space configuration , and reflects the highly inhomogeneous nature of the defect distribution in the domain regime . on the other hand , in the high - field amorphous regime @xmath207 , which is also the distance between the defects , thus reflecting homogeneity of the distribution of defects .",
    "the @xmath200 in fig.7(a ) shows strong similarity with the experimental observation in @xmath0 system of magnetic bubbles@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the intermediate regime was interpreted as the hexatic phase and the high field amorphous regime as the isotropic liquid phase@xcite .",
    "later simulation@xcite also suggested a @xmath18 dislocation unbinding transition driven by disorder .",
    "as discussed above , the presence of domain walls ( grain boundaries ) in our system suppresses the long range orientational order .",
    "this rules out the possibility of a transition between the hexatic phase and the isotropic liquid phase as the underlying reason for the rapid increase in @xmath200 .",
    "however , a rapid crossover , similar to that predicted between the qbg at low temperatures and vortex liquid at high temperatures@xcite , is still possible between the dr and the high field amorphous regime , especially at weaker pinning where the domain size @xmath95 is large@xcite .    for smaller system size ( @xmath208 )",
