    "[ f2 ] that the complex folded cdm3y6 potential gives a very good description of the elastic  data at low energies .",
    "the effect on the real optical potential caused by the density dependence of the cdm3y6 interaction shows up in the difference between the results given by the m3y - paris interaction ( dashed line in fig .",

    "@xcite is also necessary for the good optical model description of elastic scattering at low energies .",
    "it remains now to be seen whether this effect can also be observed in the bpm calculation of the  fusion reactions at very low energies .",
    "the nuclear folded m3y - paris and cdm3y6 potentials have been further used in the bpm to evaluate the  fusion cross section using eqs .",

    "the results obtained for the @xmath1 factor are shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] and one can see a reasonably good agreement of the bpm results with the experimental data @xcite over a wide range of energies",
    ". however , the slight wiggling behavior of the experimental @xmath1 factor in the energy range of 2 to 5 mev ( see fig .  [ f3 ] ) can not be reproduced by the bpm using the mean - field potential of the  system .",
    "such an oscillation of the @xmath1 factor in this energy range has been discussed as a resonant behavior of the fusion reaction @xcite caused by the relatively large spacings and narrow widths of the @xmath8mg@xmath9 compound levels @xcite .",
    "although our mean - field approach to the  potential does not include any resonance effect , the average description of the @xmath1 factor by the folded cdm3y6 potential is quite satisfactory , so that the mean - field prediction of the  reaction rate is accurate over the entire gamow range .",
    "the results of the bpm calculation shown in fig .  [ f3 ] also show that the @xmath1 factors obtained with the density independent m3y - paris interaction are somewhat lower than the experimental data and those obtained with the density dependent cdm3y6 interaction .",
    "technically it is explained by the fact that the m3y - paris potential provides a higher barrier in comparison with that given by the cdm3y6 potential .",
    "thus , the medium effects caused by the density dependence of the effective nn interaction are not negligible in the bpm calculation of the @xmath1 factor , and this conclusion is natural in view of the carbon burning process occurring in the dense baryon matter of very massive stars .",
    "the nuclear mean - field potential arising in the  collision at very low energies has been constructed in the double - folding model using the realistic nuclear density and the complex density dependent cdm3y6 interaction , based on the original m3y - paris interaction .",
    "the complex folded  potential was used in the optical model to successfully describe the elastic  scattering at the low energies around the coulomb barrier .",
    "this same potential was shown to give also a realistic description of the astrophysical @xmath1 factor for the  fusion reaction over a wide range of the energies .",
    "the mean - field description of both the elastic scattering angular distributions and the @xmath1 factor of the  reaction at the low energies has shown a rather strong medium effect caused by the density dependence of the effective nn interaction .",
    "the results obtained in the present work also confirmed the reliability of the double - folding model in the calculation of the total nuclear potential for the study of the  fusion reaction in the low - energy region of the nuclear astrophysical interest .",
    "the further use of the dfm in the calculation of both the optical potential and inelastic scattering form factor is planned to be used within the framework of the coupled channel formalism for the study of inelastic scattering with the final state of @xmath0c nucleus in excited states , such as @xmath65 state at 4.44 mev , @xmath66 state at 7.65 mev , and @xmath67 state at 9.64 mev .",
    "besides , at the low energies around the coulomb barrier the dominant final states of the reaction are @xmath4ne + @xmath10 , @xmath3na + @xmath68 and @xmath2o + @xmath69be , and it is of high interest to estimate their explicit contributions to the total reaction cross section in this energy range .",
