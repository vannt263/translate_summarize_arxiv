    "during the past one and a half decades , much observational evidence for the accelerated expansion of the present universe has appeared  @xcite . such acceleration could not be explained only by ordinary matter from which visible stars and components of galaxies in the universe are made .",
    "invisible form of matter called dark energy ( de ) , which works as a repulsive force against attracting gravity and drives the accelerated expansion , has been invoked .",
    "the observational data indicate that about 70% of the energy density in the present universe could be assigned to de .    another important notion used to explain the evolution of the present universe is the gravitationally attractive invisible substance called dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "its contribution to the total energy density is estimated to be of order  25% .",
    "dm is clustered on scales of the order of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , and its existence is so far evident only via its gravitational interaction .    despite the fact that the true origin of neither dm nor de is currently known , various ways have been suggested to model them .",
    "the simplest approach is the so - called @xmath0cdm model , where de is described by einstein s @xmath0 term , and dm is supposed to be a pressureless fluid ( cold dark matter ) .",
    "however , the well - known cosmological constant problem related to this model motivates one to look for other ways to describe the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "perhaps one of the most promising ways to address the origin of de are theories that include various fundamental fields  @xcite .",
    "other possible ways discussed in the literature are modified ( non - einstein ) gravity theories  @xcite and models with extra space dimensions @xcite .    along these lines , cosmological models with dm and de interacting with each other not only gravitationally but also by a direct coupling @xcite ( for a review , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) have a number of interesting features , and may be used in solving some known problems of modern cosmology , for example , the so - called coincidence problem . in turn ,",
    "the supposed presence in the universe of de , in one form or another , and dm provides the basis for concluding that compact systems consisting of dark energy @xcite , of dark matter @xcite , or of interacting de and dm @xcite might also exist .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study static configurations supported by interacting de ( in the form of a scalar field ) and dm ( in the form of fermion particles ) . choosing a specific type of interaction ,",
    "our objective here will be to identify the effect of this kind of nonminimal coupling on masses and sizes of resulting compact objects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ lagr_choice ] we discuss the choice of the dark matter / dark energy interaction lagrangian , which we use to derive the general set of equations for equilibrium configurations in sec .  [ gen_eqns ] .",
    "choosing an equation of state of dark matter in the form of an ideal completely degenerate fermi gas , in sec .",
    "[ fermi_dark ] we write down equations for this particular case and solve them numerically in sec .",
    "[ fermi_dark_numer ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] our results are summarized .",
    "we study the effect of the presence of direct interaction between a cosmological scalar field and dark matter on compact configurations consisting of such dark matter .",
    "our basic setup is that the dark matter , being embedded in an external , homogeneous cosmological scalar field , feels its presence not only gravitationally but also through the nonminimal coupling .",
    "obviously , the characteristics of such mixed configurations will then be determined by the properties both of the dark matter and of the scalar field .      at the moment",
    ", there exists no fundamental theory that allows to choose a specific coupling in the dark sector .",
    "therefore , any type of coupling will necessarily be phenomenological , although some models may appear to be more physically motivated than others . in modeling de in the form of a scalar field",
    ", one can meet in the literature different types of coupling between the field and dark matter .",
    "one possibility , inspired by scalar - tensor theories of gravity , is to consider an interaction of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of dark matter , @xmath3 is the cosmological scalar field , and @xmath4 can be a constant @xcite or be field dependent @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to modify the continuity equation by including an interaction term of the form @xmath5 , with @xmath6 proportional to the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "in fact , this is a fluid description of coupled dark energy .",
    "the presence of a direct coupling between scalar field and matter ( ordinary or dark ) gives rise to a fifth - force interaction whose magnitude must lie within the restrictions imposed by local gravity experiments and observational constraints from cosmology . in the case of ordinary matter , this is achieved by suggesting some mechanism suppressing the propagation of the fifth force ( a screening mechanism ) .",
    "one possibility is to introduce the so - called chameleon mechanism @xcite , which implies that the field mass depends on the surrounding matter density that effectively results in decoupling of the field from matter in a high - density background .",
    "such models are also being used in describing the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see , however , the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that the current acceleration is driven , in fact , by some quintessence field or a cosmological constant , but is not a consequence of gravity modification ) .",
    "if one initially works within the framework of general relativity , the appearance of a direct coupling between scalar field and matter is also possible when the mass of matter particles is assumed to be explicitly dependent on the scalar field .",
    "this can be an exponential dependence ( for cosmological implications , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or a linear dependence appearing as a consequence of the presence of the yukawa coupling .",
    "the latter type of interaction has been repeatedly considered in the literature . in particular , it was used in studying compact objects in refs .",
    "@xcite , in describing structure formation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in modeling interacting dm and de in the papers  @xcite .",
    "an explicit dependence of the mass of particles on a scalar field implies that by going to a description of matter in the form of a fluid , its pressure and density become functions depending explicitly on the scalar field ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , one can use instead a phenomenological possibility when a description of the interaction between scalar field and matter is performed , assuming that pressure and density are not initially explicit functions of a scalar field .",
    "such a coupling can be expressed through an interaction lagrangian of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lagrangian of matter ( ordinary or dark ) and the coupling function @xmath9 characterizes the interaction between @xmath3 and the matter . in this case",
    "the general form of the lagrangian can be presented as follows : @xmath10 the case @xmath11 corresponds to the absence of a direct coupling between matter and scalar field , when the two sources are coupled only via gravity .",
    "then , for a suitable choice of a potential energy @xmath12 , such a lagrangian can describe various models of decoupled systems , including quintessence models of dark energy .    in the cosmological context , the lagrangian was used in modeling the present accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , in describing structure formation @xcite , and when considering compact configurations @xcite . in doing so , a choice of the lagrangian @xmath8 is , in general , not unique .",
    "it can be taken as @xmath13 @xcite or @xmath14  @xcite , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy density and the pressure of an isentropic perfect fluid . by varying both these matter lagrangians with respect to a metric",
    ", one obtains the same energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid in the conventional form .",
    "however , it can be shown that , for instance , for static configurations , these lagrangians , being substituted in the general lagrangian , will give different equations for an equilibrium configuration [ the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations ] . in the case of @xmath14 , the tov equation will have the same form as when @xmath17 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the use of @xmath13 leads to the appearance of an extra term on the right - hand side of the tov equation associated with the nonminimal coupling [ see eq .   below ] .",
    "of course , in the limit @xmath11 , for both choices of @xmath8 , the gravitating system of a scalar field plus matter reduces to the same uncoupled system in which the matter and the scalar field interact only gravitationally .",
    "but in the general case of @xmath18 , these two systems will not be equivalent , giving equilibrium configurations with different properties . apparently , at the present time , it is difficult to make a motivated choice among these lagrangians @xmath8 , or any other lagrangians used in the literature ( for the other possible lagrangians and discussion of their choice for nonminimally coupled systems , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "for this reason , a description of various systems with nonminimal coupling of the type @xmath19 is made , in effect , using an _ ad hoc _ choice of @xmath8 .      in the present paper",
    ", we employ the model described by the general lagrangian with the dark matter lagrangian @xmath20 .",
    "such a choice allows one to describe naturally compact objects embedded in an external , homogeneous cosmological scalar field ( see sec .",
    "[ prob_stat ] below ) .",
    "the lagrangian also contains two functions of the scalar field : the potential energy @xmath12 and the nonminimal coupling function @xmath9 .",
    "their form is specified proceeding from some general field - theoretical considerations in such a way as to be compatible with current astronomical and cosmological observations .",
    "note that since in the model under consideration the scalar field is coupled only to dark matter , but not to ordinary matter , it is not necessary to satisfy constraints from solar - system tests of gravity .    in general , the presence of interaction between dm and de may have potentially observable cosmological implications @xcite . on the other hand , at astrophysical scales , due to gravitational instabilities , interacting dm and de may form compact dense objects composed primarily of dark matter .",
    "clearly , physical properties of such mixed configurations will depend on the form both of the coupling function and of the potential energy of the scalar field . to clarify the question of how the presence of the nonminimal coupling influences masses and sizes of the resulting compact gravitating configuration",
    ", we start from a configuration consisting only of fermionic dark matter , with no scalar field present .",
    "such objects can support themselves against gravitational contraction by the degeneracy pressure of fermions obeying pauli principle , in the same way as in the case of neutron stars and white dwarfs . after introducing the nonminimal coupling to this system",
    ", we will track changes in its properties as they depend on the parameters appearing in the functions  @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "we will use einstein s gravitational equations that allow us to take into account relativistic effects . as a matter source in these equations , we take the energy - momentum tensor , which is obtained by varying the matter part of the lagrangian with respect to the metric , @xmath21 + \\partial_{i}\\varphi\\partial^{k}\\varphi -\\delta_i^k\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\partial_{\\mu}\\varphi\\partial^{\\mu}\\varphi - v(\\varphi)\\right]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy density and the pressure of a dark matter fluid , respectively , and @xmath22 is the four - velocity .    to describe a compact spherically symmetric configuration ,",
    "we take a static metric of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath26 , the time coordinate @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the metric on the unit two - sphere . using this metric and the energy - momentum tensor",
    ", we obtain three equations ( hereafter we use units where @xmath29 ) .",
    "first and second are the @xmath30 and @xmath31 components of the einstein equations , @xmath32 and the third one follows from the law of conservation of energy and momentum , @xmath33 . taking the @xmath34 component of this equation gives @xmath35 in the above equations , the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "as has already been discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ lagr_choice ] , because of the choice of the dark matter lagrangian in the form @xmath20 , eq .   becomes different from the usual equation of hydrostatic equilibrium : in the right - hand side an extra term ( the `` fifth '' force ) associated with the coupling function @xmath36 appears .",
    "another possible choice , @xmath14 , used in refs .",
    "@xcite implies that the term containing @xmath36 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is absent .",

    ", we have four equations : the two einstein equations and , the scalar - field equation , and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium [ the modified tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation ] .      in order to perform calculations",
    ", we should choose some equation of state for dark matter . to elucidate how the interaction between dm and de affects the characteristics of compact configurations",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to some simplest form of an equation of state .",
    "namely , we assume that dark matter is an ideal completely degenerate fermi gas at zero temperature .",

    "next , introduce dimensionless variables for the current radius @xmath26 and mass @xmath50 of the configuration under consideration  @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the planck mass .",
    "the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the characteristic mass and radius obtained by landau in considering compact configurations consisting of an ultrarelativistic degenerate fermi gas within the framework of newtonian gravity . the expressions for @xmath53 and @xmath54 presented in eq .   can be obtained as follows ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if one considers a particle with mass @xmath40 located on the surface of a star , its energy is equal to the sum of the gravitational energy @xmath55 and of the fermi energy , which is proportional to @xmath56 . in these expressions",
    "@xmath57 is the total number of fermions in a star , and @xmath58 is the total mass of the star whose radius is @xmath59 . as a good estimate of the maximum possible number of fermions in a star @xmath60 , one can consider the limiting case when the energy of the particle is equal to zero , i.e. , the case when the degeneracy pressure of the fermionic fluid is balanced by the gravitational attraction . as a result , this yields @xmath61 .",
    "correspondingly , the maximum mass of the star will then be @xmath62 , which may be regarded as a characteristic mass for such fermionic configurations .",
    "the minimum value of the radius , corresponding to this maximum mass , is obtained by assuming that the kinetic energy of the fermion becomes equal to its mass on the surface of a star , i.e. , @xmath63 . as a result",

    "equation was obtained from combining eqs .   and , and eq .   follows immediately from .",
    "thus , to describe the static configuration under consideration we have obtained three equations - which must be supplemented by appropriate scalar field functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "as an example , consider here a particular choice of the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . we suppose that our spherically symmetric configuration is taken to be embedded in an external , homogeneously distributed cosmological scalar field @xmath71 . for the scalar field",

    "then it seems reasonable to choose such function @xmath69 which tends , at large @xmath26 , to 1 .",
    "such behavior of @xmath69 implies that the nonminimal coupling works only at relatively high densities of dark matter , which are typical for the inner regions of a star . on the other hand , at relatively low densities of dark matter , which are typical for interstellar and intergalactic space , the nonminimal coupling switches off . in turn",
    ", the solution for the scalar field far from the edge of the configuration smoothly matches the cosmological background value @xmath71 ( for details , see below ) . then ,",
    "if one chooses the potential energy @xmath70 , for instance , in the form of a quintessence potential , the configuration under investigation can be considered as embedded in the universe described by quintessence models .",
    "the choice of the scalar functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 is strictly model dependent and is usually done proceeding from some reasonable motivations . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the coupling function @xmath69 is taken in a power - law form which is a consequence of a conformal transformation from the string frame into the einstein frame , and @xmath70  in the form of an exponential quintessence potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath9 and @xmath12 are taken to be exponential and power functions , and their parameters are chosen in such a way as to satisfy the current observational data .",

    "note that the potential @xmath12 is an example of a tracker potential in quintessence models @xcite .",
    "moreover , the above functions are similar to those used within the framework of chameleon cosmology @xcite , where the direct coupling between a cosmological scalar field and ordinary ( baryon ) matter takes place .",

    "we refer to the obtained solutions as internal solutions .",

    "is supposed to be embedded in an external , homogeneously distributed cosmological scalar field @xmath71 , then , to provide the smoothness of solutions along the radius , we require the internal solutions to sew solutions obtained for the region @xmath90 characterized by a nonzero scalar field energy density .",
    "thus , for @xmath90 we proceed numerical solutions of eqs .   and retaining only the gravitational and scalar fields while the dark matter fluid is taken to be zero . at large distances , the scalar field reaches its asymptotic value @xmath71 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be rewritten in our dimensionless variables as follows : @xmath91 here @xmath92 and @xmath93 denote the dimensionless densities of dark energy and dark matter , respectively , measured in units of the current critical density .",
    "the factor @xmath94 appears here since we take @xmath95 instead of the reduced planck mass , @xmath96 , used in ref .",
    "this value of @xmath71 provides the current averaged cosmological density in the universe @xmath97 .",
    "formally , at the points where the scalar field becomes equal to @xmath71 , there is a nonzero gradient of the field .",
    "however , since for the values of the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath78 being used here ( see below ) the field goes to @xmath71 only at @xmath98 , the magnitude of the gradient part of the energy density @xmath99 is always much smaller than the potential energy @xmath70 .",
    "this allows us to consider the field in this region , to a good approximation , as homogeneous .    using the above procedure ,",
    "we define the mass of the configuration under consideration as the mass of all matter ( dark matter plus dark energy ) contained inside the sphere of the radius @xmath88 . in ref .",
    "@xcite configurations consisting of ordinary ( baryon ) matter nonminimally coupled to a scalar field were called `` chameleon stars . ''",
    "the reason is that the presence of such an interaction results in a substantial change of the inner structure of a star . by analogy",

    "depends both on the mass scale parameter @xmath108 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite it was taken as @xmath109 ) and on the fermion mass @xmath40 . since at the moment",
    "it is not definitely known which type of fermion makes up gravitationally bound clumps of dark matter , various fermion particles are considered in the literature .",
    "this could be both superlight gravitinos with a mass of the order of @xmath110 and superheavy wimps with a tev mass scale @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume for definiteness that @xmath40 lies in the range @xmath111 . then the value of the parameter @xmath78 is always considerably smaller than unity , and , as the numerical calculations indicate , the influence of the potential @xmath70 from on the solutions is negligibly small compared with other terms ; i.e. , the scalar field can be treated as having no potential energy on the scales associated with the fermion mass scale @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we have only one free parameter @xmath75 whose value is assumed to be @xmath112 @xcite , corresponding to gravitational strength coupling , but can be even much larger @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "the absence of maxima means that all configurations are stable .    by comparing the stable configurations with and without the scalar field ,",
    "one can identify the changes brought about by the presence of the nonminimal coupling .",
    "namely , with the increase of @xmath75 that corresponds to a stronger interaction between dark matter and dark energy , both the masses ( at a fixed star radius ) and the sizes ( at a fixed star mass ) of the systems with the field become smaller , as compared to the configurations without a scalar field .",

    "@xcite where the influence of the nonminimal coupling between scalar field and dark matter on the structure of galactic haloes was studied ) . also , taking into account the fact that the systems with the scalar field are more compact as compared to the field - free configurations having the same @xmath81 , we eventually obtain configurations whose masses are less than that of the system without a scalar field , as demonstrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ energ_mass ] .",
    "let us now derive an approximate formula for the dependence of the maximum mass of the stars on the parameter @xmath75 . to do this , first we convert the dimensionless variables to the physical ones .",
    "we recall also that not all mass - radius curves have a maximum .",
    "so , for the configurations with @xmath122 , we take the very left point of the mass - radius curve as corresponding to the maximum mass .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we take the characteristic fermion mass scale as @xmath123 , for which the characteristic landau mass @xmath124 .",
    "then the corresponding approximate expression for a maximum mass , @xmath125 , can be presented in the form @xmath126    this expression gives masses of the order of a stellar mass for the fermion mass @xmath127 .",
    "in the two extreme cases we have the following : ( i ) for superlight particles of mass @xmath128 , we get very heavy and large configurations of mass @xmath129 and the radius of the order of a typical galaxy cluster size , @xmath130 and ( ii )  for superheavy fermions of mass @xmath131 , we get light and small objects of mass @xmath132 and @xmath133 . the characteristics of realistic objects of this type , if they exist at all , will evidently lie somewhere between these limiting values .",
    "we have studied the model describing compact gravitating configurations consisting of interacting dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the latter is modeled by the scalar field @xmath3 , whose nonminimal coupling to dark matter is described by the function @xmath9 in the lagrangian . in general",
    ", the form of this function does not follow from first principles , and it must be chosen from some additional considerations . as an example , here we take this function in the form of eq .  , which was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the present accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "for such a choice , the particular case of a compact configuration with dark matter represented as an ideal completely degenerate fermi gas has been studied . in order to elucidate the role of the scalar field",
    ", we made a comparison of dark matter configurations supported only by the fermi gas with configurations containing the nonminimal coupling . in this case",
    "we showed the following :    1 .",
    "there exist regular static solutions found numerically by solving the coupled einstein - matter equations subject to a set of appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the obtained solutions describe compact mixed dark matter / dark energy configurations , whose main mass is concentrated inside the radius corresponding to the edge of the dark matter , @xmath134 , where the pressure and density of the dark matter vanish . 2 .   assuming that the effects of the nonminimal coupling are only essential at relatively high densities of dark matter",
    ", we sought such solutions for the scalar field that were started from some central value @xmath72 and went to the cosmological background value @xmath71 at @xmath98 .",
    "this provides that the nonminimal coupling function @xmath69 from eq",
    ".   tends to 1 asymptotically , and such configurations can be considered as embedded in an external , homogeneous cosmological scalar field whose density is close to the critical one @xmath97 . in other words , the configurations under consideration may be thought of as embedded in the universe described by the quintessence lagrangian with @xmath17 .",
    "one might then expect that the quintessence potential @xmath70 could be any other function compatible with observations , and not just that given by eq .",
    "( in this connection see also item ( 4 ) below ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath135 appearing in the coupling function @xmath69 and determining the strength of coupling largely influences masses and sizes of the objects under consideration .",
    "in particular , as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_m_r ] , while @xmath75 increases , both the masses ( at a fixed star radius ) and the sizes ( at a fixed star mass ) of stars with the nonminimal coupling tend to become smaller than those of configurations without a scalar field .",
    "4 .   on the scales under consideration",
    ", the potential energy @xmath70 has no substantial influence on the characteristics of the objects under investigation .",
    "this allows us to suppose that the use of another quintessence potential will give rise to configurations having similar physical parameters .    using the analogy with chameleon gravity @xcite , where the scalar field is strongly coupled to matter and has a mass that depends on the density of surrounding matter , here we call the configurations under consideration chameleon dark matter stars since their mass depends considerably on the properties of the surrounding scalar field nonminimally coupled to the dark matter .",
    "this name implies that in modeling dark matter by some equation of state relating the initially @xmath82-independent energy density and pressure , the properties of resulting compact objects will depend substantially on the form of the coupling .    with the choice of @xmath69 in the form of eq .   and the conditions given in sec",
    ".  [ prob_stat ] , solutions describing equilibrium configurations can exist only when @xmath136 along the radius of the configuration .",
    "this results in a smaller concentration of the matter along the radius for any @xmath137 ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ energ_mass ] ) , and correspondingly leads to less massive configurations , as compared with the case of a star without a scalar field ( see the right panel of fig .  [ energ_mass ] ) .",
    "it is evident that another more or less reasonable choice of @xmath69 , providing the existence of regular solutions with @xmath138 along the radius , might give rise to configurations having a greater concentration of matter , and correspondingly a greater mass ( cf . the configurations of ref .",
    "@xcite , where systems consisting of the scalar field nonminimally coupled to ordinary matter have been considered ) . in that case",
    ", one might naively expect that masses and sizes of resulting configurations would still be determined basically by the form of @xmath69 , but not by the quintessence potential @xmath70 .",
    "this must be investigated in further studies .",
