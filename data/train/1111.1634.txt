    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) represent a unique laboratory for the highly efficient acceleration of particles to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "early ideas about particle acceleration by electromagnetic waves emitted by pulsars due to @xcite led to the discovery by @xcite that a significant fraction of the spin - down power of a pulsar such as crab is dissipated through a relativistic wind with in situ acceleration of particles at its termination shock , since the cooling time scales of the synchrotron - emitting electrons are very short in x - rays .",
    "further developments led to the model of @xcite involving a low level of magnetization at the shock , raising the question of the transition from high to low sigma since the launch of the wind consisting of pairs and poynting flux involves a high magnetization    @xmath2    where @xmath3 denotes the density and @xmath4 the lorentz factor of the wind electrons and positrons . recently ,",
    "mhd simulations of such winds were performed by @xcite @xcite .",
    "central of our current understanding of pwn is that they are equatorial and highly relativistic , showing features such as backflows and jets .",
    "this might provide clues to their observational identification , since energy release presumably due to reconnection can lead to flares from the wind , considering relativistic transport effects and beaming , as recently observed in crab .",
    "moreover , the mhd models provide clues for predicting the temporal evolution of pwn , and to bring this into accordance with the observations of a large sample of putative pwn of different ages .",
    "although they are often detected as non - thermal x - ray sources , an evolved pwn can indeed lead to a fairly bright @xmath4-ray source without any lower energy counterpart @xcite @xcite .",
    "the key issue is that the low energy synchrotron emission , where @xmath5 is the synchrotron emitting lifetime of tev @xmath4-ray emitting leptons with energy e , depends on the internal pwn magnetic field @xcite which may vary as a function of time , following @xmath6 if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the power - law index of the decay of the average nebular field strength , whereas the vhe emission depends on the cmb radiation field , which is constant on timescales relevant for pwn evolution .",
    "mhd simulations of composite snrs @xcite find that @xmath9 until the passage of the reverse shock ; after it is expected that field decay would continue for much longer time since expansion continues even after the passage of the reverse shock . from hydrodynamic simulations , an expression for the time of the reverse shock passage ( i.e. the return time of the reverse shock to the origin ) has been given @xcite as    @xmath10    where the first term is the density of the ism , the second the ejecta mass during the snr explosion and the third the snr blast wave energy .",
    "the stellar wind of a high - mass star can blow a cavity around the progenitor star @xcite with relatively low ism density , so that @xmath11 .",
    "in such a case it is expected that @xmath12 can decay as @xmath13 , until the field is low enough for the x - ray flux to drop below the typical sensitivity levels . as a result ,",
    "in a scenario where the magnetic field decays as a function of time , the synchrotron emission will also fade as the pwn evolves .",
    "the reduced synchrotron losses for high - energy electrons for such a scenario will then lead to increased lifetimes for these leptonic particles . for timescales shorter than the inverse - compton lifetime of the electrons ( @xmath14 years )",
    ", this will result in an accumulation of vhe electrons which will also lead to an increased gamma - ray production due to up - scattering of cmb photons .",
    "such accumulation of very - high energy electrons in a pwn has indeed been seen in many tev pwne ( such as hess j1825 - 137 @xcite ) .",
    "to summarize , during their evolution pwn may appear as gamma - ray sources with only very faint low - energy counterparts and this may represent a viable model for many unidentified tev sources .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , shown by okkie de jager in scineghe 2008 conference @xcite .",
    "there are numerous observational hints pointing to the fact that the interstellar magnetic field in the milky way has field strength of the order of several microgauss in the inner galactic disc , and presumably drops to tenths of microgauss at higher latitudes @xcite @xcite .",
    "although neglected in previous studies , this magnetic field of the ism into which the pulsar wind nebula is expanding must have some effect onto the morphology and time evolution of the pwn .",
    "as the magnetic field in the pwn drops rather rapidly over time , as @xmath15 , it becomes comparable to the surrounding ism field at timescales roughly comparable to the transition timescale into the post - sedov phase .",
    "however , as noted above , different pwn will be located in environments where the ambient field strength is different by factors of order unity , depending rather strictly on the location of the pwn in the galaxy .",
    "the respective timescales for the field to become comparable to the ism field will therefore differ by a factor of @xmath16 for a pwn at the inner disc compared to one in the galactic halo .",
    "detailed studies of the effects on pwn morphology and evolution are highly demanding and yet challenging , owing to the limited resolution of high energy instruments and the relative scarcity of identified pwn .",
    "ancient pwne are a natural explanation for tev unidentified sources @xcite . in fact @xmath17% of tev",
    "galactic sources are still formally unidentified @xcite ; almost all ( among them , only hess j0632 + 057 @xcite , that is considered a @xmath4-ray binary candidate , and hess j1943 + 213 @xcite , considered a hbl candidate but recently suggested to be more likely a pwn @xcite , are point - like ) are extended objects with angular sizes ranging from approximately 3 to 18 arc minutes ( but of few more extended exceptions , such as hess j1841 - 055 @xcite ) , lying close to the galactic plane ( suggesting a location within the galaxy ) . in each case",
    ", the spectrum of the sources in the tev energy range can be characterized as a power - law with a differential spectral index in the range 2.1 to 2.5 .",
    "the general characteristics of these sources ( spectra , size , and position ) are similar to previously identified galactic vhe sources ( e.g. pwne ) , however these sources have so far no clear counterpart in lower - energy wavebands .",
    "this scenario is particularly suitable for several sources that , even after deep mwl observations , lack any plausible x - ray counterparts ( such as hess j1507 - 622 @xcite , hess j1427 - 608 , hess j1708 - 410 @xcite and hess j1616 - 508 @xcite @xcite ) . on the other hand , several unidentified sources have already been identified as pwne after their discovery ( such as hess j1857 + 026 @xcite or hess",
    "j1303 - 631 @xcite ) and in sources that have several plausible counterparts , the pwne contribution can hardly be avoided ( such as hot spot b in hess j1745 - 303 @xcite or hess j1841 - 055 ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the example of hess j1507 - 622 : this vhe source does not have any snr as a possible counterpart and does not show any coincident or close - by pulsar @xcite ; as said , it is expected that the pulsar already spun - down and that the x - ray nebula faded away below the sensitivity of current x - ray instruments , however it requires an arbitrary choice of the initial conditions in order to model this source : in the shown example we assume to have conditions similar to the g21.5 - 0.9/psr j1833 - 1034 system .",
    "another important consequence of these long - living gamma - ray sources regards starburst galaxies : in fact it has been recently shown @xcite that pwne are important and not negligible in explaining the tev emission detected from ngc 253 @xcite and from m82 @xcite .",
    "in fact , even if m82 and ngc253 show a much harder gev gamma - ray spectrum than the milky way ( in line with the high gas density in the star forming regions ( sfrs ) and a cosmic - ray origin of the gamma rays ) , diffusive - convective escape of the cosmic rays from the sfrs should lead to a steepening of the cosmic - ray induced gamma - ray spectrum above @xmath18 10 gev , in which case the cosmic rays would fall short in explaining the tev luminosities ; on the other hand pwne associated with core - collapse supernovae in sfrs can readily explain the observed high tev luminosities .",
    "the proof of this could arrive from deeper gamma - ray observations on other galaxies , as shown in fig .",
    ".    moreover also neutrino observations could reveal if the pwn play a role in accelerating cosmic ray protons and ions ; the highly magnetized pulsar equatorial wind may also give rise to non - negligible acceleration of cosmic rays by this source class .",
    "protons and ions , swept into the plerion by the reverse shock , could be accelerated efficiently at the ultrarelativistic pulsar wind shocks @xcite @xcite .",
    "this scenario could possibly be tested by searching for high - energy neutrinos from galactic pwns like the crab . until now ,",
    "such measurements have turned up only null - results . however , a stacking analysis of candidate sources could significantly enhance the neutrino telescope sensitivity , thus resulting in a much more decisive test of this scenario . moreover",
    "recently strong upper limits have been given by means of ice cube ( e.g. @xcite ) , limits close to the theoretical predictions .",
    "the idea of presenting this on - going job came as a small sign to honor the memory of a great scientist and a wonderful person : okkie de jager .",
    "okkie , working with you was a great honor we will miss you very much ! thank you also for encouraging to put forward this research . + bmbf contract 05a08ww1 is also acknowledged .",
