    "feedback processes play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution . in particular ,",
    "radiation pressure from the continuum absorption and scattering of starlight on dust grains has been proposed as an important mechanism in driving supersonic turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , hampering gravitational collapse , and launching large - scale galactic winds in starbursts and rapidly star - forming galaxies .",
    "one - dimensional analytic models show that dusty winds can be driven by radiation pressure in rapidly star - forming environments , such as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    however , the simplified galactic wind models contain some uncertainties .",
    "a key question that can not be addressed by analytic models is how much momentum is coupled between radiation and dusty gas . in the single scattering limit ,",
    "i.e. , the system is optically thick to the uv photons , but optically thin to the re - radiated infrared ( ir ) emission from dust grains , all photons are absorbed and scattered once , the radiation transfers a momentum flux of @xmath4 in the gas , where @xmath5 is the luminosity of radiation source .",
    "however , it is uncertain how much momentum is transferred from radiation to gas if the system is optically thick to its own infrared emission .",
    "it has been argued that the rate of momentum deposition will never exceed a few of @xmath4 ( @xcite ) , or it approaches @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean ir optical depth of the system ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to understand the dynamics of radiation - gas interaction , multidimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations",
    "have been carried out recently .",
    "krumholz & thompson ( 2012 , hereafter kt12 ) used a 2-dimensional ( 2d ) model to investigate the efficiency of momentum transfer from ir opticlaly thick ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) to a dusty atmosphere with a vertically stratified gravity . using 2d grey flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation in the orion code @xcite",
    ", kt12 showed that the radiation - gas interaction gives rise to radiative rayleigh - taylor instability ( rti ) , driving supersonic turbulence , and limiting momentum transfer from the radiation to the gas to @xmath0 .",
    "the radiation momentum deposition in the regime where is initially sub - eddington for dust is not sufficient to driven an unbound wind , most of the gas is eventually settled in a turbulent steady state confined near the base of the system .",
    "however , using a more sophisticated radiation hydrodynamics implementation of the variable eddington tensor ( vet ) algorithm in the athena code ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , davis   et al.(2014 , hereafter d14 ) revisited the results of kt12 with the same 2d and 3d setups .",
    "the vet algorithm is used to calculate the local eddington tensor by solving the radiative transfer equation with the method of short characteristics ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to kt12 , d14 showed a stronger momentum coupling between radiation and dusty gas .",
    "although the radiative rti develops and limit the radiation - gas interaction , the gas can be heated and accelerated upward by radiation , and produce an unbound outflow even from an initially sub - eddington system for dust . the significant difference between kt12 and d14 results from limitations in the diffusion - based fld scheme",
    "the fld and vet schemes agree well in the dense gas with optical depth @xmath8 , but the fld approximation becomes inaccurate in modeling the radiation field responds to structure in the gas distribution in the system of @xmath9 few .",
    "@xcite simulated the same problem of kt12 and d14 using their new ramses - rt code with the m1 closure for the eddington tensor .",
    "their results are qualitatively closer to those obtained with the fld rather than with the vet method . like fld , in the m1 closure algorithm",
    "the radiation force is ultimately insufficient to overcome the gravity , and the gas eventually settles down in an initially sub - eddington system . on the other hand , more recently simulation based on",
    "the implicit monte carlo radiation transfer scheme is more consistent with d14 ( @xcite ) . among a variety of algorithms , including ray tracing from point sources , flux - limited diffusion , m1 closure and vet ,",
    "vet has been demonstrated to have the most accurate methods for problems involving a diffuse radiation field .",
    "note that in the previous mentioned simulations of radiation - gas interaction , the size of the computational box is only about @xmath10 pc@xmath11 pc , with a resolution of @xmath12pc , so that one can resolve the sound crossing timescale and the scale of gas turbulence . in order to investigate the efficiency of momentum coupling and wind propagation on a larger scale , krumholz & thompson ( 2013 , hereafter kt13 ) assumed that a wind is initially launched at the base of the galactic atmosphere due to super - eddington radiation forces or other mechanisms , and turned off the gravity to study the maximum velocity the gas can gain from radiation .",
    "using also orion and the fld scheme , kt13 found that after wind acceleration begins , rti forces the gas into a configuration that reduces the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation filed to the gas by a factor of @xmath13 compared to an estimate based on the optical depth at the base of the atmosphere , the momentum transfer to gas is only a few of @xmath0 , without significant amplification by radiation trapping .",
    "they concluded that radiation pressure on dust is unlikely to be able to drive winds and ejecta from star - forming clusters and galaxies .",
    "so far , no other simulations have been done for the wind - gas interaction problem . given previous discrepancies ,",
    "it is important to re - examine the results of kt13 using the vet method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "we briefly summarize the equations and the simulation setup .",
    "the initial conditions of the gas are given by the end states of the simulations from d14 . in section [ results ]",

    "the astrophysical implications are discussed in section [ sec_discussion ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "as in d14 , we solve the equations of radiation hydrodynamics using athena with the built - in radiation module ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of mass , momentum , energy , radiation energy and radiation momentum conservation are @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the gas density , fluid velocity and the gravitational acceleration , @xmath18 is the pressure tensor , @xmath19 is the gas pressure , @xmath20 is the identity matrix , and @xmath21 is the total fluid energy density .",

    "the thermal and dynamical behaviors of dust and gas has been discussed in kt13 ( see their appendix a ) . in the parameter space",
    "we are concerned with , the dust is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field , thus we have the dust temperature @xmath32 . on the other hand , the dust thermally couples with the gas only if the gas density exceeds @xmath33 @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as the ism material is accelerated and spreads out , the gas no longer has the same temperature as the dust .",
    "however , since gas is highly supersonic in the outflow , the thermal pressure is much weaker compared to ram pressure , changing the gas temperature does not obviously affect the dynamics of the gas . for simplification",
    "we still assume @xmath35 in our work .",
    "the radiation pressure @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the eponymous vet , which is calculate directly by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the differential of solid angle , and @xmath41 is the cosine factor .",
    "the specific intensity of the radiation field @xmath42 can be solved by the radiation transfer equation @xmath43 this equation is solved using the short characteristics method , as descried in detail in @xcite .    for simplicity",
    ", we use the planck @xmath44 and rosseland @xmath45 mean opacities ( kt12 , kt13 , d14 ) @xmath46 equation ( [ opacity ] ) gives an approximation with a dusty gas at @xmath47k ( @xcite ) .",
    "we set @xmath48 in equations ( [ source1 ] ) and ( [ source2 ] ) .",
    "as shown in kt12 , the system with gravity is characterized by two dimensionless numbers , i.e. , the dimensionless eddington ratio @xmath49 and the optical depth @xmath50 here we take @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the characteristic temperature .",
    "physically , the atmosphere of a rapidly star - forming galaxy is initially set to have a temperature of @xmath53 everywhere , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the initial eddington and optical depth of the atmosphere .",
    "the characteristic sound speed are defines by @xmath56 the scale height @xmath57 , density @xmath58 and time @xmath59 are @xmath60 following kt12 and d14 , we choose @xmath61k , which corresponds to @xmath62kpc@xmath63 , and @xmath64 @xmath65 g@xmath66 .",
    "the vet and monte carlo methods imply that a wind can be also launched for an initially sub - eddington system with @xmath67 , while the fld and m1 closure methods imply that a dusty wind can be launched only for @xmath68 .",
    "nevertheless , if a dusty wind has been launched by radiation pressure or other mechanisms , it has already overcome its gravitational potential at the base of the system .",
    "following kt13 , we focus on the limit of @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 in our simulations . in this case",
    "an accelerating wind without gravity gives an upper limit of momentum transfer between radiation and dusty gas .",
    "next , we need to define another set of natural units for the gravity - free system .",
    "we use a characteristic acceleration @xmath71 which measures the radiation force on the dust .",

    "@xmath2 can be estimated by the volume - weighted mean optical depth @xmath195 we average @xmath196 in our simulations and find @xmath197 in t1 , 7.9 in t3l , 8.5 in t3h and 48.3 in t10 , thus , we can define the efficiency @xmath198 where @xmath199 is equivalent to @xmath200 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath201 in t1 , 0.71 in t3l , 0.69 in t3h , and 0.47 in t10 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for @xmath202 , radiation pressure on dust is able to drive an unbound wind .",
    "the momentum transfer from the radiation field to the gas is amplified by a factor of @xmath203 with @xmath3 , increasing with the optical depth in the atmosphere .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath204 , the wind may eventually fall back and be bound .      since @xmath55 and @xmath78 are the most important parameters in the simulations , it is worthwhile to estimate them in real rapidly star - forming galaxies and starbursts .",

    "the characteristic temperature in the atmosphere is given by @xmath210 , and the surface gravitational force is @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the mass fraction of the gas .",
    "thus , we have @xmath213 here , equation ( [ obs1 ] ) gives an upper bound of the infrared optical depth in the atmosphere of the galaxy .",

    "although @xmath55 of the atmosphere is much less the total @xmath55 , we still expect @xmath221 .",
    "our simulation suggests that the infrared radiation may launch dusty gas out of the galaxy , as @xmath78 drops above the galactic disk , the gas may be accelerated and become unbound .",

    "however , the radiative rti does not seem to be limiting momentum transfer as in kt13 .",
    "we find that the momentum coupling between gas and radiation in the absence of gravity is similar to that with gravity .",
