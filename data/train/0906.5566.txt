    "in the early seventies , penrose @xcite showed that by combining several ingredients of the `` establishment viewpoint '' of gravitational collapse , an inequality of the form @xmath0 follows , where @xmath1 is the total mass and @xmath2 the area of a black hole .",
    "cosmic censorship is one of the fundamental ingredients of the argument , and by far the weakest one .",
    "thus , finding a counterexample of ( [ pi1 ] ) would very likely involve a spacetime for which cosmic censorship fails to hold .",
    "in fact , this was penrose s original motivation to study the inequality .",
    "on the other hand , a proof of a suitable version of ( [ pi1 ] ) would give indirect support to cosmic censorship .",
    "inequalities of this type are collectively termed `` penrose inequalities '' ( sometimes also `` isoperimetric inequality for black holes '' @xcite ) and finding suitable versions thereof and trying to prove them has become a major task in mathematical relativity . after a first period of heuristic proofs and partial results , important breakthroughs have been made in the last ten years .",
    "the aim of this review is to try to explain the problem and describe the main approaches that have been followed .",
    "the first observation to be made is the necessity of replacing the area of the black hole in ( [ pi1 ] ) by the area of a suitable alternative surface .",
    "this is because in order to determine whether a spacetime is a black hole , detailed knowledge of its global future behaviour is required . on the other hand ,",
    "cosmic censorship is precisely a statement on the global future evolution of a spacetime . in order to have an inequality logically independent of cosmic censorship (",
    "although motivated by it ) the area on the black hole must be replaced by the area of a surface which can be located independently of the global future behaviour of the spacetime ( for instance , directly in terms of the initial data ) and which is guaranteed ( or at least expected ) to have less or equal area than the event horizon that may eventually form during the evolution .    the global setup which supports the validity of ( [ pi1 ] ) is well - known and , in rough terms , goes as follows .",
    "assume a spacetime @xmath3 which is asymptotically flat in the sense of being strongly asymptotically predictable , admitting a complete future null infinity @xmath4 and satisfying @xmath5 ( see @xcite for definitions ) .",
    "the event horizon @xmath6 is the boundary of @xmath7 and it is , therefore , a null hypersurface at least lipschitz continuous .",
    "assume , moreover , that the spacetime admits an asymptotically flat partial cauchy surface with total adm energy @xmath8 and which intersects @xmath6 on a cut @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a smooth hypersurface then this cut is a smooth embedded surface which has a well - defined area @xmath10 . for general event horizons , the area @xmath10 still makes sense provided it is interpreted as its 2-dimensional hausdorff measure ( the hausdorff measurability of @xmath9 is demonstrated in @xcite ) .",
    "consider now any cut @xmath11 to the causal future of @xmath9 along the event horizon .",
    "the black hole area law @xcite states @xmath12 provided the null energy condition holds .",
    "this area theorem was proven for general event horizons in @xcite under much milder asymptotic conditions . from physical principles ,",
    "the spacetime is expected to settle down to some equilibrium configuration .",
    "assuming also that all the matter fields are swallowed by the black hole in the process ( an external electromagnetic field would not alter the conclusions , see sect .",
    "[ stronger ] ) , the uniqueness theorems for stationary black holes ( see e.g. @xcite ) imply that the spacetime must approach the kerr metric ( modulo several technical conditions that still remain open , see @xcite for a recent account ) . for the kerr metric ,",
    "the area of the event horizon @xmath13 is independent of the cut ( as for any killing horizon ) and takes the value ( in units @xmath14 ) @xmath15 where @xmath1 and @xmath16 are respectively the total mass and total angular momentum of the spacetime ( we do not use the more common term `` @xmath17 '' for the angular momentum to avoid confusion with the energy flux used later ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 should be the asymptotic value of the bondi mass along @xmath4 .",
    "since gravitational waves carry positive energy , the bondi mass can not increase to the future @xcite .",
    "provided the bondi mass approaches the adm mass @xmath18 of the initial slice ( which is only known under additional assumptions , see @xcite ) , the inequality @xmath19 follows .",
    "this inequality is still global in the sense that the cut @xmath9 of the event horizon can not be determined directly in terms of the initial data .",
    "idea was to consider situations in which one could estimate the area of the cut from below in terms of the area of some surface that could be located without having to solve the whole future evolution .",
    "one such situation occurs when the initial data set is asymptotically euclidean and contains a future trapped surface ( see below for definitions ) .",
    "then , the singularity theorems of penrose @xcite , hawking @xcite and others ( see @xcite for a review ) state that , provided the strong energy condition holds ( in some cases the null energy condition suffices ) , the maximal globally hyperbolic development of this data must contain a singularity , i.e. an incomplete inextendible causal geodesic .",
    "very little is known in general about the nature of the singularity that forms .",
    "more specifically it is not known whether the future development admits a complete @xmath20 and therefore defines a black hole spacetime .",
    "the weak cosmic censorship conjecture , first proposed by penrose @xcite , asserts that all singularities lie behind an event horizon and therefore are invisible to an observer at infinity .",
    "not much is known about the general validity of this conjecture , which remains a fundamental open problem in gravitational collapse physics , see @xcite .",
    "rigorous results are available only in the case of spherical symmetry , where the conjecture has been proven for several matter models @xcite .    under cosmic censorship , the initial data containing a future trapped surface @xmath9 develops a black hole spacetime . a general result on black hole spacetimes",
    "@xcite is that no future trapped surface can enter into the causal past of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the intersection of the event horizon and the initial data set @xmath21 defines a spacelike surface @xmath22 that separates @xmath9 from the asymptotic region .",
    "in general , the location of @xmath23 can not be determined directly from the initial data .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 can have smaller area than @xmath9 , even though it lies in its exterior .",
    "nevertheless , under suitable restrictions on @xmath9 ( details will be given below ) it makes sense to consider all surfaces in @xmath21 enclosing @xmath9 .",
    "the infimum of the areas of all such surfaces , denoted by @xmath24 , has the obvious property that @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , the inequality @xmath26 follows from penrose s heuristic argument .",
    "the need of using the minimum area enclosure of @xmath9 in ( [ localpi ] ) was first noticed by jang and wald @xcite and the first example showing that @xmath9 may have greater area than surfaces enclosing it is due to horowitz @xcite .",
    "inequality ( [ localpi ] ) involves objects defined solely in terms of the local geometry of the initial data set and its validity can therefore be addressed independently of whether weak cosmic censorship ( or any other of the ingredients entering into the argument ) holds or not .",
    "it is clear that , since @xmath24 depends on the hypersurface @xmath21 containing @xmath9 , we can still take the supremum of the right - hand side with respect to all asymptotically flat hypersurfaces containing @xmath9 , and the resulting inequality still follows from penrose s heuristic argument .",
    "this gives a clearly stronger inequality .",
    "however , it depends on the piece of spacetime available and therefore looses the desirable property of depending solely on objects defined on the initial data set .",
    "if the initial data set is asymptotically hyperbolic instead of asymptotically flat ( i.e. such that it intersects future null infinity in its cauchy development ) , the same heuristic argument gives ( [ localpi ] ) with the bondi mass replacing the adm mass in the left hand side .",
    "another setup where a local geometric inequality is implied by the global heuristic argument of gravitational collapse appears in the seminal paper by penrose @xcite and consists of a null shell @xmath27 ( with compact cross sections ) of collapsing dust in minkowski spacetime .",
    "as described in more detail below , for any given shape of the shell ( restricted to be convex at each instant of time in order to avoid shell crossings in the past ) and any chosen cross section @xmath9 on the shell , the energy density of the collapsing dust can be adjusted so that @xmath9 is a marginally trapped surface with respect to the geometry of the spacetime left after the shell has passed .",
    "since a singularity will definitely form in this setup ( the shell has self - intersections in its future ) , cosmic censorship predicts the formation of a black hole .",
    "similarly as before , the marginally trapped surface @xmath9 can not enter the causal past of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the intersection of the event horizon with the shell @xmath27 must therefore lie in the causal past of @xmath9 .",
    "however , since the shell is convex and collapsing , the event horizon cut automatically has at least the same area as @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the heuristic collapse argument implies @xmath28 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the shell . by energy conservation , this can be computed directly on @xmath9 in terms of its geometry as a surface in minkowski .",
    "thus , a geometric inequality is obtained for a class of spacelike surfaces in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the status of this version of the penrose inequality will be discussed in detail later on .",
    "all versions of the penrose inequality have the structure of a lower bound of the total mass of the spacetime in terms of the area of suitably chosen surfaces .",
    "therefore , they can be regarded as strengthenings of the positive mass theorem , which says that the total mass of an asymptotically flat spacetime can not be negative , under suitable energy and completeness conditions .",
    "the positive mass theorem also has a rigidity part , namely that the total mass vanishes only for the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the penrose inequality conjecture also has a rigidity part , which in rough terms states that equality will only happen for the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "heuristically this can be understood because , in the case of equality , the final mass of the spacetime must coincide with the starting one .",
    "therefore , no gravitational waves are emitted in the process .",
    "this suggests that the whole configuration should be stationary .",
    "however , the only stationary , vacuum black hole is the kerr spacetime , and equality happens for this metric only if the angular momentum is zero , i.e. if the metric is , in fact , the schwarzschild spacetime .    since the original proposal by penrose this topic has become an active area of research",
    "however , the problem has proven to be a difficult one and relatively little progress was made during the first decades . the most important contribution in this period",
    "is due to geroch @xcite , who observed that a suitable functional defined on surfaces embedded in a spacelike hypersurface @xmath29 is monotonically increasing if the curvature scalar of @xmath30 is non - negative and the surfaces are moved outwards at a speed which is inversely proportional to the mean curvature of the surface at each point .",
    "this is the so - called _ inverse mean curvature flow_. this functional ( now called geroch mass ) has the property of approaching the adm energy of the hypersurface ( provided this is asymptotically euclidean ) if the surfaces become sufficiently spherical at infinity .",
    "geroch s original idea was to prove the positive mass theorem by starting the inverse mean curvature flow at a point ( where the geroch mass vanishes ) .",
    "this idea was then adapted by jang and wald @xcite , who noticed that the geroch mass coincides exactly with the right - hand side of ( [ pi1 ] ) if the starting surface is connected , of spherical topology and minimal ( i.e. with vanishing mean curvature ) . if the flow existed globally and the leaves could be seen to approach round spheres at infinity , then the monotonicity of the geroch mass would imply the penrose inequality in the particular case of time - symmetric initial data sets .",
    "the flow however , generically develops singularities and therefore the argument could not be made rigorous at the time . the only case where the penrose inequality could be proven to hold was in spherical symmetry ( irrespectively of whether the initial data set was time - symmetric or not ) using the so - called hawking mass , which is a generalization of the geroch mass when the second fundamental form is not zero .    in the late nineties ,",
    "however , two important breakthroughs were made .",
    "first of all , huisken and ilmanen @xcite were able to prove that geroch s heuristic derivation could be turned into a rigorous proof .",
    "this required deep results in geometric analysis and geometric measure theory .",
    "these authors established therefore the validity of the penrose inequality for asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifolds of non - negative ricci curvature and having a boundary consisting of an outermost minimal surface ( this is now called the _ riemannian penrose inequality _ ) .",
    "although this boundary was allowed to be disconnected , the penrose inequality could only be established for the area of any of its connected components .",
    "shortly afterwards , bray @xcite was able to prove the riemannian penrose inequality in full generality ( i.e. in terms of the total area of the outermost minimal surface , independently of whether this is connected or not ) .",
    "bray s argument is completely different to the previous one and uses a deformation of the given metric in such a way that all the non - trivial geometry gets swallowed inside the minimal surface while the total mass of the space does not increase and the area of the horizon does not decrease .",
    "this process settles down into an equilibrium state given by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "since the penrose inequality is fulfilled in the final state ( in fact , with equality ) , the penrose inequality holds also for the original space .",
    "these two fundamental results have boosted tremendously the interest in the penrose inequality , which has become a very important topic in mathematical relativity .",
    "although the general case is still open , several ideas have been proposed to approach it .",
    "in particular , an important step forward has been made very recently by bray and khuri @xcite .",
    "although several issues remain still open regarding this proposal ( in particular , the existence of solutions of certain pde problems ) the idea is indeed very promising .",
    "the aim of this review is to present the most important developments in this field .",
    "i have chosen not to follow a historical order , and rather i have tried to organize the presentation in a way which i consider logically convenient . since several approaches share some of the techniques , i have collected many preliminary results in one section ( sect .",
    "[ definitions ] ) . while this has the potential disadvantage that , in a first reading , it is not clear why and where such results are needed , it has the advantage of simplifying the location of the required tools .",
    "readers wishing to enter straight into the topic of the penrose inequality may skip this section and refer back to it whenever necessary .",
    "an important warning is in order .",
    "the topic `` penrose inequalities '' is vast and has many ramifications .",
    "although i will try to cover the most important results in the field , i make no claim of exhaustivity .",
    "there are several other review papers on this topic in the literature . for the early results the reader",
    "is advised to look at @xcite .",
    "the breakthroughs of huisken & ilmanen and bray triggered the publication of a number of interesting reviews , where the proofs of the riemannian penrose inequality were treated in detail , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the structure of the review is as follows . in section",
    "[ definitions ] the basic facts that will be needed later are introduced .",
    "this section is divided into five subsections . in subsection",
    "[ codimension - two ] the geometry of @xmath31-dimensional surfaces as submanifolds of an @xmath32-dimensional spacetime is described , and several types of surfaces are defined . in subsection [ variation_null_expansion ]",

    "the paper finishes with a some concluding remarks in section [ concluding ] .",
    "a spacetime @xmath3 is a connected hausdorff manifold endowed with a smooth metric of lorentzian signature ( with sign convention @xmath33 ) .",
    "smoothness is assumed for simplicity , many of the results below hold under weaker differentiability assumptions .",
    "we further take @xmath34 orientable and @xmath3 time - orientable and that an orientation for both has been chosen . in this review",
    "we will be mainly concerned with four - dimensional spacetimes , although higher dimensional results will be mentioned at some places .",
    "@xmath34 will always be four - dimensional unless explicitly stated .",
    "the penrose inequality involves the area of codimension - two surfaces .",
    "let us therefore start with some basic properties concerning their geometry .",
    "@xmath9 will denote a compact , embedded , oriented , codimension - two surface in an @xmath32-dimensional spacetime @xmath3 defined via an embedding @xmath35 ( @xmath9 will usually be identified with its image ) .",
    "the induced first fundamental form on @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath36 , is assumed to be positive definite , i.e. @xmath9 is spacelike .",
    "such an object will be called simply `` surface '' .",
    "the area of @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 .    at @xmath37",
    "we denote by @xmath38 and @xmath39 the tangent and normal spaces of @xmath9 .",
    "this implies @xmath40 . for any vector @xmath41 at @xmath42",
    "this decomposition defines a parallel and a normal vector according to @xmath43 .",
    "the second fundamental form vector @xmath44 of @xmath9 is defined , as usual , as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are tangent to @xmath9 and @xmath48 is the covariant derivative on @xmath3 .",
    "this tensor is symmetric and its trace @xmath49 defines the mean curvature vector .",
    "the trace - free part of @xmath44 will be called @xmath50 in the following .",
    "@xmath9 being oriented and the ambient spacetime being oriented and time oriented , it follows easily that there exist ( globally on @xmath9 ) two linearly independent null vector fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 orthogonal to @xmath9 .",
    "these vectors , which span the normal bundle @xmath53 , will always be chosen to be future directed and satisfying @xmath54 ( dot stands for scalar product with the spacetime metric @xmath55 ) .",
    "they are uniquely defined up to rescalings @xmath56 , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , plus interchange @xmath59 .",
    "the null expansions of @xmath9 are defined as @xmath60 and they contain the same information as @xmath61 since @xmath62 .",
    "a surface @xmath9 can be classified according to the causal character of @xmath61 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no unique and generally accepted agreement on how to call the various types of surfaces which arise . in this paper , the following notation will be used ( in our convention , the zero vector is both future null and past null ) :    * * future trapped : * @xmath61 is timelike and future directed everywhere ( equivalently @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) * * weakly future trapped : * @xmath61 is causal and future directed everywhere ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) . * * marginally future trapped : * @xmath61 is proportional to one of the null normals @xmath67 with a non - negative proportionality factor ( @xmath68 and @xmath66 , or viceversa ) .    *",
    "past trapped * , * weakly past trapped * and * marginally past trapped * are defined by reversing all inequalities .",
    "all these types of surfaces have a mean curvature vector of definite causal character and time orientation .",
    "for brevity , when no indication to future or past is given , then future should be understood ( i.e. a `` trapped surface '' is meant to be a future trapped surface , and similarly for the other cases ) .",
    "it is often useful to consider surfaces for which one of the null normals can be geometrically selected .",
    "this preferred normal will be called `` outer null normal '' and will always be denoted as @xmath69 .",
    "notice that `` outer '' here does not necessarily refer to any notion of exterior to @xmath9 , so this definition must be used with special care . nevertheless , when the null normals can be geometrically distinguished , the corresponding null expansions are also geometrically distinct and the following definitions ( which place no restriction on @xmath70 ) become of interest .",
    "* * weakly outer trapped : * @xmath65 . * * marginally outer trapped or mots : * @xmath68 ( equivalently , @xmath61 points along the outer null normal ) . *",
    "* weakly outer untrapped : * @xmath71 . * * outer untrapped : * @xmath72 .",
    "these definitions depend not only on the choice of outer direction , but also on the time orientation of the spacetime .",
    "if the time orientation is reversed ( without modifying the outer direction ) then @xmath73 becomes the future outer null direction .",
    "therefore by adding the word `` past '' to any of the four definitions above , the surface is meant to satisfy the same inequalities with @xmath74 replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , a * past weakly outer trapped * surface satisfies @xmath76 .",
    "very recently bray and khuri @xcite have proposed a version of the penrose inequality which involves a type of surfaces whose definition is insensitive to reversals of time direction .",
    "however , they still require a preferred outer direction .    * * generalized trapped surface : * at each point , either @xmath65 or @xmath76 ( or both ) . *",
    "* generalized apparent horizon : * at each point , either @xmath77 and @xmath66 , or @xmath78 and @xmath71 .",
    "notice that generalized apparent horizons are in particular generalized trapped surfaces .    in the detailed classification of surfaces according to its mean curvature vector presented in @xcite ,",
    "generalized apparent horizons are termed _",
    "null untrapped _ , which , in my opinion , has the advantage of being more descriptive .",
    "in fact , my preferred term for these surfaces would be _ null outer untrapped _ because this emphasizes the fact that they have a privileged `` outer '' direction .",
    "however , notation is always a very personal matter and , in this review , i will stick to the name _ generalized apparent horizon _ put forward by bray and khuri in their new proposal of the penrose inequality .    in terms of the mean curvature vector ,",
    "a generalized trapped surface is one where @xmath61 is allowed to point everywhere except along a spacelike outer direction ( defined to be a spacelike direction with positive scalar product with @xmath51 ) .",
    "a generalized apparent horizon has a mean curvature vector which is null everywhere and moreover , has non - negative scalar product with any outer spacelike direction .",
    "notice that the second condition is ensured provided the scalar product with _",
    "one _ outer spacelike direction is non - negative .",
    "generalized trapped surfaces are indeed generalizations of the previous concepts . in particular , weakly future trapped and",
    "weakly outer trapped surfaces are automatically generalized trapped surfaces , and the same is true for marginally outer trapped surfaces .",
    ".types of surfaces according to their null expansion(s ) . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      an important technical tool that will be used often below is the first order change of the null expansions @xmath79 under variations of the surface . in this section",
    "we write down the variations of @xmath79 along the null normals @xmath67 , which we write as @xmath80 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us first recall briefly how variations of a geometric object @xmath81 are defined .",
    "any vector field @xmath82 in a neighbourhood of @xmath9 defines a _ variation _ of the surface as follows . for small enough @xmath83 ,",
    "let @xmath84 be the embedding defined by moving @xmath85 a parametric amount @xmath86 along the integral curve of @xmath82 starting at @xmath42 .",
    "we write @xmath87 .",
    "assume , for definiteness , that @xmath81 is a covariant tensor geometrically defined on any surface and take a variation @xmath88 of @xmath9 .",
    "define @xmath89 , i.e. the pull - back of the tensor @xmath81 attached to @xmath90 at the point @xmath91 .",
    "this defines a curve of tensors at each point @xmath37 .",
    "the geometric variation is simply @xmath92 .",
    "this derivative only depends on the values of @xmath82 on @xmath9 for truly geometric objects .",
    "however , when @xmath81 requires additional structure for its definition , then derivatives of @xmath82 on @xmath9 may also arise .",
    "this behaviour occurs for instance in @xmath93 which requires making a specific choice of @xmath94 on each surface @xmath90 .",
    "applying this procedure to the area of @xmath9 gives ( see e.g @xcite ) the _ first variation of area _",
    "@xmath95 where @xmath96 is the metric volume form of @xmath9 in particular , the change of area of @xmath9 for variations along the null directions @xmath67 are determined by the integral of the null expansion @xmath79 .",
    "let us next write down @xmath97",
    ". since @xmath98 and @xmath52 are interchangeable , the corresponding expression with also hold for variations along @xmath99 after making the substitution @xmath100 everywhere .",
    "we start with the variation of the induced metric , which is well - known to be @xmath101 where @xmath102 etc .",
    "are tensorial indices on @xmath9 .",
    "this implies @xmath103 for the variation of the volume form on @xmath9 . for the variation of @xmath74 along @xmath51 , it is necessary to relate the null normal @xmath94 on each one of the varied surfaces @xmath90 to the corresponding null normal on the original surface . as already stressed , this introduces a dependence on the first derivative of @xmath51 via @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the ricci tensor of @xmath3 .",
    "a more involved calculation gives the derivative of @xmath70 along @xmath94 ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the riemann tensor of @xmath3 , @xmath109 denotes the levi - civita covariant derivative of @xmath110 and the one - form @xmath111 is defined by @xmath112 where @xmath46 is any tangent vector to @xmath9 . the gauss identity for @xmath9 as a submanifold of @xmath3 implies @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the scalar curvature of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , ( [ lthetak ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the einstein tensor of @xmath55 .",
    "these expressions are valid in any dimension .",
    "the expression for @xmath117 follows from ( [ lthetak2 ] ) by interchanging @xmath118 and substituting @xmath119 ( see formula ( [ svector ] ) above ) .",
    "codimension - two surfaces usually arise as codimension - one surfaces embedded in a spacelike hypersurface @xmath21 of the spacetime @xmath34 .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath21 will be denoted by @xmath120 ( latin , lower case indices run from 1 to 3 ) and the second fundamental form with respect to the unit future normal @xmath121 will be denoted by @xmath122 .",
    "the constraint equations relate the geometry of @xmath21 with some components of the einstein tensor @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the curvature scalar of @xmath30 , @xmath125 is the covariant derivative in @xmath29 , the total energy density is defined as @xmath126 and the energy flux one - form @xmath127 is defined as @xmath128 on any vector @xmath46 tangent to @xmath21 .",
    "the initial data set satisfies the _ dominant energy condition _ provided @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the norm of @xmath131 with respect to the metric @xmath120 .",

    ", there exists a slice for which the outermost mots lies in the intermediate kruskal portion , which leads directly to a violation of ( [ pit+ ] ) .",
    "this example is also a counterexample to a version of the penrose inequality suggested by penrose himself in @xcite , which goes a follows .",
    "suppose that an asymptotically euclidean initial data set contains a weakly future trapped boundary @xmath9 and the spacetime evolves according to weak cosmic censorship .",

    "since the collapse is taking place in the future and @xmath27 extends towards the past and exterior region , one expects from physical grounds that @xmath270 does not change sign ( this is because @xmath27 approaches weaker gravitational fields and hence outer past directed expansions should be positive ) . under these circumstances ,",
    "the intersection of @xmath27 with the event horizon has at least the same area than @xmath9 , and hence the usual heuristic argument implies @xmath19 .",
    "the counterexample by ben - dov shows that this inequality is not generally true either .",
    "the difficulty with the argument is double .",
    "first of all , the assumption that @xmath270 never becomes negative along @xmath27 need not be true ( notice that such a property is _ not _ implied by the raychaudhuri equation ( [ lthetal ] ) ) . in the example by ben - dov",
    ", this property is not fulfilled if the starting surface @xmath9 is any of the spherically symmetric future trapped surfaces lying either in the intermediate kruskal region or in the innermost closed dust flrw region ( see figure 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the argument above also relays on the implicit assumption that @xmath27 intersects the black hole event horizon . in the example in @xcite",
    "these hypersurfaces end up in the white hole singularity and do not intersect the event horizon anywhere .",
    "weakly outer trapped surfaces on a spacelike hypersurface satisfy @xmath271 and the outermost such surface @xmath264 is a mots ( i.e. @xmath272 ) . given an initial data set @xmath273 , a new one @xmath274 can be obtained simply by changing the time orientation , i.e. by setting @xmath275 and @xmath276 . the heuristic argument to prove the penrose inequality obviously applies equally well to this new initial data set . for surfaces which are boundaries of exterior domains ,",
    "the future outer null direction is now @xmath277 , and therefore the weakly outer trapped surfaces satisfy @xmath278 , or equivalently @xmath279 ( this is , in fact , obvious since the change in time orientation changes @xmath280 ) .",
    "similarly as before , one can construct the _ past trapped region _",
    "@xmath281 as the union of interiors of all such boundaries .",
    "andersson and metzger s result ( theorem [ anderssonmetzger ] ) implies again the existence of a unique outermost surface @xmath282 which satisfies @xmath283 ( i.e. a past marginally outer trapped surface ) .",
    "thus , penrose s heuristic argument also supports the inequality @xmath284 in a given initial data set , neither @xmath251 contains @xmath285 nor viceversa , in general . although not supported by any heuristic argument , a version of the penrose inequality along the lines of ( [ pit+ ] ) which has also been proposed is @xmath286 since @xmath287 contains both trapped sets , the area of its boundary is not smaller than the minimal area enclosures @xmath288 or @xmath289 .",
    "thus , ( [ pit ] ) is in general a stronger inequality than ( [ piheut+ ] ) or ( [ piheut- ] ) .",
    "so far no counterexample of ( [ pit ] ) has been found and it is not clear whether the inequality should hold or not . in the time - symmetric case",

    "[ riemannian ] below . inequality ( [ pit ] ) also reduces to either ( [ piheut+ ] ) or ( [ piheut- ] ) in any situation where @xmath141 is known to be identically zero on the outermost future and past mots .",
    "an example of this behaviour is given by a class of axially symmetric and conformally flat initial data sets presented in @xcite .",
    "for a subclass thereof , the validity of the inequality ( [ pit ] ) has been verified numerically in @xcite .    in the spherically symmetric case ,",
    "both @xmath251 and @xmath281 are obviously spherically symmetric and one of them necessarily contains the other .",
    "the penrose inequality ( [ pit ] ) is known to be true in that case , as we discuss in the following section . since the example by ben - dov deals with a spherically symmetric spacetime and a spherically symmetric slice",
    ", it can not provide a counterexample to ( [ pit ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , very few explicit examples are known where ( [ pit ] ) has been verified in situations where it does not reduce to either ( [ piheut+ ] ) or ( [ piheut- ] ) .",
    "the only cases outside spherical symmetry that i am aware of involve a numerical analysis of three special classes of initial data sets @xcite . in all these examples the inequality ( [ pit ] ) was numerically confirmed .    still another version of the penrose inequality has been very recently proposed by h. bray and m. khuri .",
    "the fundamental idea behind this proposal is to use generalized trapped surfaces instead of weakly outer trapped surfaces .",
    "recall that , on an initial data set , a surface that bounds an exterior domain is a generalized trapped surface provided @xmath290 .",
    "this class of surfaces has two main advantages over weakly outer trapped surfaces : first , its definition is insensitive to time reversals , so that one can get rid of the complications of dealing with several sets , like @xmath251 , @xmath281 or their union .",
    "there is only one generalized trapped set @xmath291 ( in a given initial data set ) and this contains both @xmath251 and @xmath281 ( and , obviously , its union ) .",
    "moreover , the boundary @xmath292 is a smooth generalized apparent horizon , due to eichmair s result ( theorem [ eichmair ] above ) .",
    "the second advantage is that @xmath292 is area outer minimizing , i.e. @xmath293 .",
    "consequently , a penrose inequality involving generalized trapped surfaces can be stated in a much simpler form in terms of the area of @xmath292 , without the need of invoking minimal area enclosures .",
    "the penrose inequality proposed by bray and khuri thus reads @xmath294 this version is automatically stronger than ( [ piheut+ ] ) or ( [ piheut- ] ) because @xmath291 encloses the other trapped sets .",
    "arguments in favor of this version will be given below , where we discuss bray and khuri s approach in more detail .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that the heuristic argument by penrose _",
    "does not _ support this version .",
    "the reason is that one of the key ingredients for the heuristics to go through is that the surfaces under consideration lie behind the event horizon provided a black hole does indeed form .",
    "however , this property is not generally true for generalized trapped surfaces .",
    "an example can be constructed as follows .",

    ", it would be of interest to find a proof of the penrose inequality in terms of the total adm mass in spherical symmetry directly in terms of the given data .",
    "this might give some new clues on how the general penrose inequality can be addressed .",
    "as already mentioned , the field has experienced a fundamental breakthrough in the last decade or so with the complete proof of the penrose inequality in the time symmetric case , first by huisken and ilmanen @xcite for a connected horizon and then by bray @xcite for an arbitrary horizon . both papers dealt with the four - dimensional case . however , while huisken and ilmanen s proof is very specific to four dimensions ( because of the use of the geroch mass ) , bray s approach can be generalized to any spacetime dimension not bigger than eight , as recently shown by bray and lee @xcite .    by definition ,",
    "an initial data set is called time - symmetric whenever @xmath134 .",

    "in fact , the weak energy condition ( defined as @xmath337 for all causal vectors ) suffices in this case .",
    "another immediate consequence is that @xmath338 and , hence , the trapped region @xmath251 , the past trapped region @xmath281 and the generalized trapped region @xmath291 all coincide in this case .",
    "its boundary @xmath298 is the outermost minimal surface , which is non - empty as soon as there is a bounding surface with negative mean curvature ( with respect to the normal pointing into the chosen asymptotically euclidean end ) .",
    "this is a corollary of theorems [ anderssonmetzger ] and [ eichmair ] above .",
    "however , in this context this result is known to hold even in more generality . as discussed in @xcite , following classic results on minimal surfaces @xcite , it is sufficient to define the trapped region @xmath229 as the image of all immersed minimal surfaces in @xmath21 together with the bounded connected components of its complementary .",
    "it follows that the boundary of this set is a collection of smooth , embedded , minimal 2-spheres and that any connected component of @xmath339 is an `` exterior '' region , i.e. an asymptotically euclidean manifold free of minimal surfaces ( even immersed ) and with compact and minimal boundary composed of a finite union of 2-spheres .",
    "the penrose inequality therefore becomes an inequality relating the total mass and the area of the outermost minimal surface @xmath298 in @xmath29 with respect to the chosen asymptotically euclidean end .",
    "the corresponding inequality @xmath340 is usually termed `` riemannian penrose inequality '' since it involves directly riemannian manifolds , with no further structure coming from the ambient lorentzian manifold .",
    "as already mentioned , the penrose inequality has a rigidity part , namely that equality is achieved only for slices of the kruskal extension of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the time - symmetric slices of this spacetime define a manifold @xmath341 with induced metric @xmath342 the surface @xmath343 is minimal and separates the manifold into two isometric pieces ( corresponding to the two asymptotic ends of the kruskal metric ) .",
    "the rigidity part of the riemannian penrose inequality states that if equality is achieved in ( [ piriem ] ) then the region in @xmath29 outside its outermost minimal surface @xmath298 is isometric to the domain @xmath344 of @xmath345 with @xmath346 .    before discussing the breakthroughs of huisken & ilmanen and bray ,",
    "let us discuss some previous attempts to address the riemannian penrose inequality .",
    "shortly after schoen and yau proved the positive mass theorem , witten @xcite proposed a completely different method using spinors ( see @xcite for a rigorous version of witten s ideas ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether spinorial techniques can be also applied to the penrose inequality .",
    "after all , the spinor techniques had been successfully extended to prove the positive mass theorem in the presence of black holes ( more precisely , marginally trapped surfaces ) in the initial data @xcite ( see @xcite for a rigorous proof ) .",
    "the main difficulty lies in finding suitable boundary conditions on witten s equation on the boundary of the black holes so that the boundary term arising by integrating the schrdinger - lichnerowicz @xcite identity can be related to the area of the black hole .",
    "an interesting attempt to achieve this in the riemannian case is due to m. herzlich @xcite , who obtained a penrose - like inequality involving not just the total mass and area of the minimal surface but also a sobolev type constant of the manifold . depending on the space under consideration ,",
    "herzlich s inequality may turn out to be stronger or weaker than the penrose inequality ( see @xcite for a limiting case where this inequality reduces simply to a positive mass statement ) .",
    "nevertheless , the inequality is still optimal in the sense that equality is achieved only for the schwarzschild manifold .",
    "the class of manifolds considered in @xcite consists of asymptotically euclidean 3-dimensional , orientable riemannian manifolds @xmath29 having an inner boundary @xmath347 which is topologically an @xmath296 and geometrically a minimal surface . no assumption is made on whether this surface is the outermost minimal surface in @xmath29 or not .",
    "this already indicates that the inequality to be proven can not be the standard penrose inequality because minimal surfaces with large area can be shielded from an asymptotically euclidean region with small mass by an outermost minimal surface with sufficiently small area , while maintaining non - negative ricci curvature everywhere .",
    "this is often called `` shielding effect '' and explicit examples are easily constructed by cutting the schwarzschild manifold ( [ gsch ] ) on a sphere at @xmath348 and attaching a piece of @xmath349 of large radius with a cap near the north pole removed ( this manifold belongs to the class of initial data leading to the so - called oppenheimer - snyder spherical dust collapse @xcite )    the inequality proven by herzlich reads @xcite @xmath350 where @xmath351 is a geometric , scale invariant , quantity on @xmath29 defined as @xmath352 where @xmath353 denotes , as usual , the collection of smooth functions with compact support .",
    "equality in ( [ herzlichpi ] ) occurs if and only if @xmath29 is isometric to the exterior of the schwarzschild manifold ( [ gsch ] ) outside the minimal surface @xmath343 .    the proof is based on an improvement of the positive mass theorem ( also proven in @xcite ) valid for asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifolds @xmath354 of non - negative scalar curvature having an inner boundary @xmath355 which is topologically a sphere and which may have positive , but not too large , mean curvature ( with respect to the normal pointing towards infinity ) . more precisely , the mean curvature @xmath42 must satisfy the upper bound @xmath356 this positive mass theorem also has a rigidity part that states that equality is achieved if and only if @xmath354 is the exterior of a ball in euclidean space ( this implies , in particular , that the only surface @xmath9 in @xmath357 which is topologically an @xmath296 and which satisfies @xmath358 is in fact a sphere ) .",
    "the proof of this theorem involves finding appropriate boundary conditions for the witten spinor on @xmath355 so that the boundary term in the schrdinger - lichnerowicz identity on the inner boundary gives a non - negative contribution .    the penrose - like inequality ( [ herzlichpi ] )",
    "is then proven by finding a conformally rescaled metric @xmath359 , with @xmath360 at infinity in such a way that @xmath361 has vanishing scalar curvature and the mean curvature of @xmath347 with respect to the metric @xmath361 saturates the inequality ( [ inequalitymeancurvature ] ) .",
    "moreover , the conformal rescaling is shown to decrease the mass at least by the amount given in the right - hand side of ( [ herzlichpi ] ) . here",
    "is where the quantity @xmath351 arises .",
    "since the mass after the rescaling is non - negative due to the positive mass theorem above , the penrose - like inequality follows .",
    "the rigidity part holds because , in the case of equality in ( [ herzlichpi ] ) , @xmath29 is conformal to the flat metric outside a ball and , moreover , its curvature scalar vanishes ( if this was non - zero , then the decrease in mass due to the conformal rescaling would be _ larger _ than the right - hand side of ( [ herzlichpi ] ) , which can not occur in the equality case ) . since the only conformally flat , scalar flat and asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifold with a minimal surface is the schwarzschild space ( [ gsch ] ) , the rigidity part follows .",
    "this penrose - like inequality has been generalized in three different ways .",
    "first , herzlich @xcite extended the results to spin manifolds of arbitrary dimension @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the boundary @xmath347 is assumed to be a compact and connected minimal surface of positive yamabe type ( i.e. such that it admits a metric of positive constant scalar curvature @xmath362 ) . denoting by @xmath363 the yamabe constant ( i.e. @xmath364 where @xmath365 is the @xmath366-dimensional volume of the boundary )",
    ", the penrose - like inequality reads @xmath367 where @xmath351 is the analogous scale invariant quantity in higher dimensions @xmath368 the idea of the proof is similar to the three - dimensional case .",
    "the second generalization @xcite involves _ maximal _ initial data sets @xmath153 .",
    "although this result is not a riemannian penrose inequality , the methods used are very similar to the previous ones and it is therefore natural to include it here .",
    "the idea of the proof involves , again , a positive mass theorem for manifolds with suitable boundary and finding an appropriate conformal factor which transforms the data so that the previous mass theorem can be applied while decreasing the mass by a certain amount .",
    "more precisely , the class of manifolds @xmath153 under consideration are asymptotically euclidean spin manifolds of arbitrary dimension @xmath32 satisfying the dominant energy condition @xmath129 .",
    "as before , the boundary @xmath347 is connected , compact and of positive yamabe type .",
    "the condition of being minimal is replaced by three conditions , namely ( i ) the mean curvature @xmath42 ( with respect to the direction pointing towards infinity ) is non - positive ( ii ) @xmath369 ( or alternatively @xmath370 ) everywhere , and @xmath371 ( @xmath111 is defined in([defs_a ] ) ) . under these circumstances , the total energy satisfies the bound @xcite @xmath372 the constant @xmath373 is always non - negative under assumptions ( i)-(ii ) .",
    "thus , inequality ( [ maertenpi ] ) is weaker than the corresponding one in the time - symmetric case ( [ piherzlichdimn ] ) .",
    "the conditions on the boundary @xmath347 are somewhat surprising .",
    "conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) state that the mean curvature vector of the surface points inward ( in the sense that its product with the outer normal @xmath135 is non - positive ) and is causal past ( future ) everywhere .",
    "thus , the boundary is indeed weakly past ( future ) trapped .",
    "however , these type of surfaces are necessarily not area outer minimizing ( except in the very special case that their mean curvature vector vanishes identically ) .",
    "consequently , the minimal area enclosure of the boundary lies , in general , inside @xmath21 .",
    "thus , this penrose - like inequality is obtained for a surface for which the original penrose inequality is not expected to hold .",
    "it is therefore interesting that such an inequality exists .",
    "the third generalization is due to m. khuri @xcite and again involves a non - vanishing second fundamental form .",
    "since the method uses the jang equation in a fundamental way , we postpone its discussion to the end of subsection [ jang1 ] .      an interesting attempt to proof the riemannian penrose inequality",
    "is discussed in h.l .",
    "bray s ph.d thesis @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider a special class of surfaces which interpolate between the outermost minimal surface @xmath298 , tends to large round spheres at infinity and for which the geroch mass is non - increasing .",
    "although this sounds familiar with the inverse curvature flow argument of geroch , the idea exploited by bray is in fact very different .",
    "indeed , instead of using flows of surfaces , bray considers , for any given volume , an area minimization problem ( i.e. an isoperimetric problem ) .",
    "assume that the outermost minimal surface @xmath298 is connected and consider the class of surfaces in the same homology class as @xmath298 .",
    "one can associate to each surface @xmath9 in this class the volume bounded between @xmath298 and @xmath9 ( counted negatively in the portion where @xmath9 lies inside @xmath298 and positively where it lies outside ) . for a given value of @xmath374 ,",
    "consider the collection of surfaces which bound , together with @xmath298 , precisely a volume @xmath375 and define @xmath376 as the infimum of the corresponding areas .",
    "if the infimum is attained on a surface @xmath377 , then this surface is obviously of constant mean curvature @xmath378 because it is the solution of an isoperimetric problem .",
    "bray s idea is to show that the geroch mass is a non - increasing function of @xmath375 .",
    "let us start by assuming that @xmath377 exists and that the function @xmath376 is twice differentiable .",
    "then , the first variation of area together with the fact that the area is the first variation of volume , gives @xmath379 ( prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath375 ) and the geroch mass ( [ gerochmass ] ) becomes simply @xmath380 provided the surface @xmath377 is connected and of spherical topology .",
    "consider now a variation of @xmath377 along its outer unit normal @xmath135 with unit speed .",
    "if we denote by @xmath381 the corresponding flow of surfaces ( with @xmath382 ) , the second variation of area gives @xmath383 where we have used ( [ mp ] ) in the second equality .",
    "using now the gauss - bonnet theorem and the non - negativity of the curvature scalar of @xmath29 we conclude @xmath384 . denoting by @xmath385 the volume bounded by @xmath381",
    ", it follows that @xmath386 because @xmath376 is the infimum of all areas bounding a volume @xmath375 .",
    "since these two functions touch at @xmath387 , it follows @xmath388 . performing a change of variables @xmath389 ,",
    "one concludes @xmath390 although the argument just described assumes that @xmath376 is differentiable , the conclusion is still valid if a suitable weak ( distributional ) derivative is taken @xcite .",
    "the other two assumptions that enter into the argument are ( i ) that @xmath377 is connected and of spherical topology and ( ii ) that the infimum of @xmath376 is in fact attained i.e. that the surface @xmath377 exists .",
    "the first condition turns out to be crucial and needs to be imposed as an assumption ( in fact , the hypothesis can be relaxed to demand just that for each @xmath391 if one or more minimizers of @xmath376 exists then at least one of them is connected ; this is termed `` condition 1 '' in @xcite ) .",
    "most of the technical work in @xcite consists in showing that condition ( ii ) ( i.e. the existence of a minimizer for all @xmath374 ) imposes no extra restriction .",
    "to that aim , bray first argues that the class of metrics @xmath29 can be chosen to be exactly schwarzschild at infinity ( a similar , but weaker , reduction is also used in bray s full proof of the riemannian penrose inequality summarized in subsection [ braysproof ] and will be discussed in more detail there ) .",
    "the heart of the proof of existence of the minimizer @xmath377 consists in proving that the isoperimetric surfaces in the schwarzschild spacetime are given by the spherical orbits of the @xmath295 isometry group .",
    "contrarily to what one may expect , proving this fact is not a trivial matter .",
    "the fundamental idea behind the construction is to use a comparison metric ( in this case the flat metric on @xmath357 ) for which one knows that the spheres are the solutions of the isometric problem .",
    "this argument , which was tailored for the schwarzschild metric , has been simplified and substantially extended in @xcite , where simple conditions are found on a given spherically symmetric metric which ensure that the spheres are the minimizers of the isoperimetric problem .",
    "summarizing , bray proves in @xcite that the penrose inequality ( [ piriem ] ) holds for each asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifold which has a connected outermost minimal surface @xmath298 and satisfies `` condition 1 '' .      the heuristic idea behind the proof of huisken and ilmanen",
    "was first proposed by geroch @xcite and is based on the observation that the geroch mass ( [ gerochmass ] ) ( with @xmath212 ) is monotonically increasing if the surfaces are moved by inverse mean curvature ( i.e. @xmath392 ) provided the scalar curvature of @xmath29 is non - negative .",
    "this fact is clear from ( [ dmg ] ) since @xmath393 and the derivative of @xmath394 is then a sum of non - negative terms .",
    "another immediate property of @xmath395 is that its value on any connected , topologically @xmath296 minimal surface is @xmath396 . for surfaces @xmath397 in the asymptotically euclidean end @xmath398 , the asymptotic decay of @xmath30 implies @xmath399 .",
    "thus , @xmath395 indeed interpolates between the left and right - hand sides of the penrose inequality .",
    "geroch original idea was to prove the positive mass theorem by starting the inverse mean curvature flow from a point so that @xmath400 initially ( the point can be approached as the limit of very small coordinated spheres ) .",
    "the positivity of mass would follow provided the inverse mean curvature flow remained smooth all the way to infinity and the flow approached large coordinate spheres in the asymptotically euclidean end .",
    "jang and wald @xcite realized later on that the same argument could be used to prove the penrose inequality by starting from the outermost minimal surface .",
    "in fact , @xmath42 vanishes on this minimal surface , and hence the velocity @xmath401 diverges there .",
    "however , by starting the flow from surfaces which approximate the outermost minimal surface from outside , the penrose inequality would follow .",
    "however , it was immediately realized that the flow will not remain smooth in general and that singularities will develop .",
    "the first variation of area implies that , as long as the flow remains smooth , the area of the surfaces increases exponentially .",
    "consider now , as a very simple example , two disjoint balls in euclidean space . by symmetry",
    ", each surface will evolve under imcf to a larger sphere with exponentially increasing radius .",
    "thus , the two surfaces will necessarily touch in finite time and the flow can not remain smooth forever .",
    "a less trivial example , discussed in @xcite , consists of a thin torus in euclidean space .",
    "the differential equation satisfied by @xmath42 under imcf is of parabolic type and the maximum principle implies that @xmath42 stays bounded above in terms of its initial value ( and the background geometry ) as long as the flow remains smooth .",
    "thus , the torus will flow outwards at positive speed bounded away from zero and it will thicken .",
    "however , sufficiently thick torus have vanishing mean curvature at points on their inner rim .",
    "the speed becomes infinity there and the flows necessarily stops being smooth .    the presence of singularities made this idea dormant for decades .",
    "the only case were the method was made rigorous involved a particular case of metrics called _ quasi - spherical metrics with divergence - free shear _",
    "@xcite , where the flow was seen to remain smooth all the way to infinity .",
    "huisken and ilmanen s fundamental contribution was to define the flow in a suitably weak sense so that the singularities could be treated ( and , in fact , basically avoided ) .",
    "an important ingredient in huisken and ilmanen s approach is the use of a level set formulation for the imcf ( which is a geometric parabolic flow ) .",
    "this means describing the leaves of the flow as the level sets of a real function @xmath402 on @xmath21 .",
    "the imcf condition translates directly into the following degenerate elliptic equation for @xmath402 @xmath403 where @xmath404 is the divergence of @xmath375 in @xmath29 . in principle",
    "it is possible that @xmath402 remains constant on open sets , which has the immediate consequence that the flow may jump across regions with positive measure .",
    "the fundamental idea is to use these jumps precisely to avoid the singularities that the smooth imcf would otherwise have . in order to achieve this ,",
    "huisken and ilmanen find a variational formulation for ( [ degel ] ) .",
    "this equation is not the euler - lagrange equation of any functional .",
    "however , by freezing the right - hand side to @xmath405 , the authors write down the functional ( which now depends on @xmath402 ) @xmath406 the critical points of this functional with respect to compactly supported variations of @xmath407 gives ( [ degel ] ) with @xmath402 replaced by @xmath407 on the left - hand side .",
    "one then looks for functions @xmath402 which minimize their own functional , thus giving ( [ degel ] ) .",
    "this variational formulation has a geometric counterpart which , in rough terms , implies that each of the level sets of @xmath402 ( defined as @xmath408 for positive @xmath409 ) is area outer minimizing .",
    "thus , if we start from a smooth surface @xmath410 which is area outer minimizing and with positive mean curvature , the imcf ( which enjoys short time existence thanks to its geometric parabolic character ) will evolve the surface smoothly for some `` time '' @xmath86 . for small enough values of @xmath86 , each level set will be outer area minimizing . however , there may well exist a value for which @xmath90 ceases to be area outer minimizing .",
    "take the smallest of such values , @xmath411 .",
    "this means that there exists a surface @xmath412 which encloses @xmath413 and has less or equal area .",
    "in fact , it must have equal area because if if had strictly less area , it would also have less area than some close enough previous leaf ( the flow is smooth up to @xmath411 and the area changes smoothly ) . the surface @xmath412 may have common points with @xmath413 .",
    "however , the surface @xmath414 must be a minimal surface because otherwise it would admit a compactly supported variation that would reduce its area while still remaining outside @xmath413 and enclosing it .",
    "however , this varied surface would ( i ) enclose all surfaces in the flow from @xmath410 up to @xmath413 , ( ii ) have larger area than @xmath410 ( because the latter is area outer minimizing ) and ( iii ) have less area that @xmath413 .",
    "so , for some value of the flow parameter smaller than @xmath411 it would have the same area , and it would enclose it .",
    "this would contradict the definition of @xmath411 as being the smallest value with such property .",
    "notice that , a priori , this outer minimizing prescription does not exclude that the flow may become singular already in the interval @xmath415 , where all the leaves remain area outer minimizing . that this can not happen is one of the several statements that huisken and ilmanen had to show , and which makes their proof technically difficult .    in the torus example before , the smooth flow would thicken the torus ( in an axially symmetric way ) until a surface is obtained which has exactly the same area than the surface obtained by closing its hole by two horizontal planes .",
    "it is clear in this example that the new pieces have vanishing mean curvature .",
    "since the level set function @xmath402 is such that each level set is outer area minimizing , this means that the imcf evolves smoothly for as long as the leaves remains area outer minimizing until a surface which is not area outer minimizing is eventually reached . at this point ,",
    "the surface jumps ( meaning that @xmath402 remains constant between the two surfaces ) .",
    "the flow should be continued from the new surface outwards .",
    "since the new surface has pieces with @xmath177 , the imcf can not be defined there in a classical sense .",
    "however , the weak formulation in terms of level sets also takes care of this .",
    "a crucial condition for the monotonicity argument to go through in this formulation is that the geroch mass does not increase in the jumps . we know that the total area does not change .",
    "moreover , the new pieces of the surface have @xmath177 , while the deleted pieces have @xmath416 because the flow was smooth up to and including @xmath90 . thus , across the jump",
    "the geroch mass is non - decreasing provided the euler characteristic of the surface does not decrease .",
    "the example with the torus shows that in general the topology of the surface may change across the jump , in that case changing from a surface with genus one to a topological sphere . in this particular case , the euler characteristic increases and the geroch mass would be monotonically increasing .",
    "the question is therefore whether this is a general property or not .",
    "the example with two spheres in euclidean space shows that this can not be true in general .",
    "there , the value of the euler characteristic is initially four and after the jump a topological sphere forms , for which @xmath417 .",
    "a general result by huisken and ilmanen @xcite is that a topologically @xmath296 surface in an asymptotically euclidean three - manifold @xmath29 outside the outermost minimal surface can not jump , via the weak formulation of the imcf , to another surface with smaller euler characteristic , i.e. no holes can appear on the surface after the jump .",
    "nevertheless , the outermost minimal surface @xmath9 in @xmath29 needs not be connected .",
    "consequently , for the geroch mass to remain monotonic under the weak imcf , a connected component @xmath418 of the outermost minimal surface must be chosen as initial surface .",
    "the penrose inequality proven by huisken and ilmanen is , therefore , @xmath419 where @xmath420 runs over the connected components of the outermost minimal surface .",
    "as mentioned before , the riemannian penrose inequality also has a rigidity part . in this",
    "setting , this states that equality is achieved in ( [ pihi ] ) if and only if the region in @xmath29 outside its outermost minimal surface @xmath298 is isometric to the domain @xmath344 of @xmath345 ( [ gsch ] ) with @xmath346 .",
    "heuristically , it is clear that some rigidity is to be expected already from the monotonicity property of the geroch mass .",
    "if equality is achieved , then the derivative of the geroch mass is everywhere zero . in particular , in the smooth part of the flow , @xmath421 , @xmath422 and each leaf is totally umbilical ( i.e. @xmath423 ) at each point .",
    "the imcf condition gives @xmath424 on each leaf .",
    "since @xmath425 , the variation formula ( [ mp ] ) implies @xmath426 .",
    "this implies that each leaf is a metric sphere ( because @xmath427 ) .",
    "the exponential grow of the area gives @xmath428 . defining a new variable @xmath429",
    ", the metric @xmath30 takes the form @xmath430 . the expression for the geroch mass and the fact that it takes a value @xmath172 independent of @xmath86 gives @xmath431 , and",
    "hence @xmath30 is the schwarzschild metric outside the minimal surface @xmath432 .",
    "this is , of course , a heuristic derivation .",
    "huisken and ilmanen are able show the same results using only the weak flow .",
    "huisken and ilmanen s proof has interesting side consequences .",
    "first of all , the argument does not use the positive mass theorem anywhere and therefore the method gives an independent proof of this important result . in the presence of an outermost minimal surface , positivity of @xmath18",
    "is an obvious consequence of the theorem .",
    "if @xmath21 is free of minimal surfaces , it suffices to start the weak inverse mean curvature flow at one point , making rigorous the original idea of geroch .",
    "another interesting consequence deals with the so - called bartnik mass ( or capacity ) @xcite , defined as follows . a 3-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath433 with no boundary and compact metric closure is called admissible if it can be isometrically embedded into a complete and connected asymptotically euclidean three - dimensional manifold @xmath29 satisfying the following three properties : ( a ) the curvature scalar is non - negative , ( b ) the boundary of @xmath21 is either empty or a minimal surface , and ( c ) @xmath21 is free of any other minimal surfaces ( the original definition excludes minimal surfaces even at the boundary of @xmath21 , this modification is due to huisken and ilmanen @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath29 is called an admissible extension .",
    "the bartnik capacity is the infimum of the adm masses of all possible extensions of @xmath433 . by the positive mass theorem ,",
    "it is immediately non - negative and it was conjectured in @xcite to be positive if @xmath433 is not a subset of euclidean space .",
    "huisken and ilmanen used the weak imcf to reach a slightly weaker conclusion , namely that if the bartnik capacity is zero , then @xmath433 is locally isometric to euclidean space .",
    "the idea of the proof is to take a point @xmath42 in @xmath161 where the metric is non - flat and choose any admissible extension @xmath29 .",
    "consider the weak imcf starting at @xmath42 .",
    "for some small enough value of the flow parameter the corresponding leaf @xmath434 can be proven to have a positive geroch mass , and to lie within @xmath161 independently of the extension ( this means in particular that @xmath434 is area outer minimizing independently of the extension ) .",
    "thus , monotonicity of the imcf gives the lower bound @xmath435 .",
    "since this is independent of the extension , the result is established .",
    "another consequence of huisken and ilmanen s construction is the so - called `` exhaustion '' property of the bartnik mass .",
    "this can be formulated as follows .",
    "consider an asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifold @xmath436 and any increasing collection of bounded sets @xmath437 satisfying @xmath438",
    ". then the bartnik mass @xmath439 tends to the adm mass when @xmath440 .",
    "this is proven in @xcite by taking suitable coordinate balls within each @xmath441 in such a way that the coordinate radius @xmath442 tends to @xmath443 .",
    "it is shown , by using the imcf , that the bartnik mass of each @xmath441 is bounded below by the geroch mass of the corresponding coordinate balls .",
    "the geroch mass of the coordinate balls tends to the adm mass when @xmath444 .",
    "since the bartnik mass of @xmath441 is obviously bounded above by @xmath18 of @xmath21 , the exhaustion property @xmath445 follows .",
    "bray was able @xcite to prove the riemannian penrose inequality for arbitrary outermost minimal surfaces , with no restriction of connectedness .",
    "bray s proof also uses geometric flows in an essential way , but instead of flowing surfaces in a fixed riemannian manifold , as in huisken and ilmanen s proof , it uses a flow of metrics .",
    "the idea is to modify the metric with a one - parameter family of conformal factors so that the curvature scalar remains non - negative , the new horizon with respect to the conformal metric has the same area as the original one and the total adm mass does not increase during the process . if , moreover , the flow can be defined in such a way that , as @xmath446 , the riemannian manifold outside its horizon converges to the @xmath447 portion of the schwarzschild manifold ( [ gsch ] ) in a suitable sense , then the penrose inequality for the original manifold follows because the inequality ( in fact equality ) holds in the limit .",
    "this conformal flow also allows bray to show the rigidity part of the penrose conjecture , namely that equality holds if and only if the starting riemannian manifold is isometric to the exterior region of schwarzschild .",
    "bray s statement of the penrose inequality deals with three - dimensional asymptotically euclidean , riemannian manifolds @xmath29 with one or several asymptotic ends ( in the latter case , one of them is selected and the mass and the concept of `` outer '' are taken with respect to this end ) and which contain an area outer minimizing horizon @xmath410 . by definition ,",
    "a horizon is a smooth , compact , minimal surface which is a boundary of an open set @xmath448 containing all possible asymptotic ends on @xmath29 except the one that has been selected . in the case of several",
    "ends the existence of such a horizon is guaranteed , otherwise @xmath436 is assumed to have one . an area outer minimizing horizon need not be outermost , although the outermost one ( which always exists ) will have at least the same area as @xmath410 ( by the area outer minimizing property of the former ) .",
    "as already said , @xmath410 need not be connected and bray s theorem states @xmath449 with equality if and only if @xmath29 is isometric to the exterior region of the schwarzschild manifold .",
    "the first step in bray s proof is to reduce the class of metrics under consideration .",
    "to that aim , bray uses an interesting result due to schoen and yau @xcite ( c.f .",
    "theorem 7 in @xcite ) which states that given an asymptotically euclidean , three - dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath29 ( see proposition 4.1 in @xcite for a similar statement in any dimension ) with @xmath450 , and any positive number @xmath451 , there always exists an asymptotically euclidean metric @xmath452 on @xmath21 , with @xmath453 everywhere and identically zero outside a compact set @xmath229 , which is conformally flat outside @xmath229 , i.e. @xmath454 on @xmath455 , where @xmath456 is a positive function approaching a positive constant at infinity ( on each one of the asymptotic ends ) .",
    "moreover , the following conditions are fulfilled , @xmath457 i.e. the total mass changes within @xmath451 and the metric itself changes pointwise at most by @xmath451 ( in the sense that unit vectors change their norm at most by @xmath451 ) . the condition that @xmath452 has vanishing curvature scalar outside @xmath229 implies that @xmath458 is harmonic ( with respect to the flat metric ) .",
    "therefore , the metric @xmath452 is called _ harmonically flat_. this perturbation result has been strengthened in bray s ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite to show that @xmath458 can in fact be taken to be spherically symmetric , in which case @xmath459 is the schwarzschild metric outside @xmath229 .",
    "such a metric is called _ schwarzschild at infinity_. this stronger version was needed to apply the isoperimetric methods described in sect .",
    "[ isoperimetricprofile ] .",
    "schoen and yau s perturbation result implies that , in order to prove the riemannian penrose inequality , it is sufficient to consider harmonically flat metrics",
    ". indeed , if there existed a counterexample to the penrose inequality , i.e. a metric with total adm mass strictly smaller than the geroch mass of its outermost minimal surface , then we would be able to find a harmonically flat metric @xmath452 with adm mass within @xmath451 of the original one .",
    "since the area of the outermost minimal surface also depends continuously on @xmath451 , it is clear that @xmath451 can be arranged so that the penrose inequality would also be violated for the harmonically flat metric @xmath452 .    for this class of manifolds",
    ", bray defines a flow of metrics by a conformal rescaling @xmath460 which depends on a parameter @xmath461 .",
    "the function @xmath462 is defined via an elliptic equation for @xmath463 together with the initial value @xmath464 ( so that @xmath465 ) .",
    "@xmath466 is defined by solving the dirichlet problem @xmath467 where @xmath468 is the outermost minimal area surface enclosing @xmath410 with respect to the metric @xmath469 and @xmath470 is the exterior of @xmath468 .",
    "since @xmath468 is defined using the metric one is trying to construct , it is not obvious a priori that such problem admits a solution .",
    "bray uses a discretization argument whereby @xmath471 as a function of @xmath409 ( i.e. for fixed value of @xmath472 ) is discretized as a continuous piecewise linear function @xmath473 ( in @xmath409 ) , where the jumps in the derivatives occur at fixed intervals of length @xmath451 .",
    "the slope of @xmath474 on the @xmath475-th interval , i.e. on @xmath476 , @xmath477 is defined inductively in @xmath475 . at @xmath478 ,",
    "@xmath479 is zero inside @xmath410 and solves the laplace equation @xmath480 with boundary data @xmath481 on @xmath410 and @xmath482 at infinity .",
    "@xmath483 is then defined as the outermost minimal area enclosure of @xmath410 with respect to the metric @xmath484 ( the function @xmath485 is known by continuity ) .",
    "notice that since @xmath410 was not assumed to be the outermost minimal surface , @xmath11 may be far away from @xmath410 even for arbitrarily small @xmath451 .",
    "assume that the construction has been carried out for @xmath477 , then the slope @xmath479 on the interval @xmath486 is defined as being zero inside @xmath487 and solving the laplace equation @xmath480 which approaches the constant @xmath488 at infinity and vanishes on @xmath489 .",
    "the surface @xmath490 is defined as the outermost minimal area enclosure of @xmath487 with respect to the metric @xmath491 ( again , the function @xmath492 is known by continuity ) .",
    "thus , while the metric is changed continuously in @xmath409 , the boundaries @xmath493 change only at discrete values .",
    "existence of @xmath494 follows from the inductive construction .",
    "the conformal flow of metrics depends on @xmath451 .",
    "it is an important ingredient of bray s proof to show that a suitable limit @xmath495 exists , thus defining the flow of metrics in ( [ braysflow ] ) .",
    "the limit is performed in two ways , first the conformal factors are seen to converge when @xmath495 to a locally lipschitz function @xmath462 .",
    "this already defines the metric @xmath469 and the surfaces @xmath468 as before . extending the discrete collection of @xmath496 to a one - parameter family via @xmath497 for @xmath498 the convergence of these surfaces when @xmath495 ( for fixed @xmath409 )",
    "is then considered .",
    "it turns out that the limit may depend on the subsequence @xmath499 .",
    "bray denotes the collection of all limit surfaces as @xmath500 , where @xmath221 identifies the element in the collection .",
    "convergence is seen to be in the hausdorff distance sense and each element in @xmath501 is proven to be a smooth surface .",
    "the surfaces @xmath468 and @xmath500 need not always coincide . however , they are closely related : for any @xmath502 , @xmath503 encloses @xmath504 ( for any @xmath505 ) and @xmath506 encloses @xmath507 ( for any @xmath508 ) .",
    "thus , they must coincide for any value where @xmath468 depends continuously on @xmath409 .",
    "bray then proves that @xmath468 is continuous except for @xmath409 in a countable set @xmath17 ( which may be empty ) .",

    "moreover , for @xmath509 , @xmath503 encloses @xmath507 .",
    "thus , the flow of surfaces @xmath510 is everywhere outward and may jump , also outwards , at a countable number of places .",
    "in addition , and this is crucial for the proof of the penrose inequality , the area of @xmath468 is constant for all @xmath409 , even at the jumps . outside the jumps , this constancy can be understood heuristically because @xmath468 is a closed minimal surface and hence its area does not change to first order with respect to any variation , in particular the variation which transforms @xmath468 into @xmath511 ( @xmath512 small ) in the metric @xmath469 .",
    "the area also changes because the metric depends on @xmath409 .",
    "however , since @xmath513 on @xmath468 by construction , the metric @xmath514 coincides with @xmath469 on @xmath468 to first order and therefore the area of @xmath468 with the metric @xmath469 coincides to first order with its area with respect to @xmath515 .",
    "this implies that @xmath516 is constant . at the jumps ,",
    "the statement requires a careful analysis of the various limiting procedures involved .",
    "the second crucial ingredient in bray s proof is the fact that the total mass @xmath517 of the conformally rescaled metric @xmath469 is a non - increasing function of @xmath409 .",
    "the proof relies on two facts .",
    "first of all , the definition of @xmath466 in @xmath518 seems to depend on @xmath30 and on @xmath409 .",
    "however , as a simple consequence of how the laplacian changes under conformal rescalings , it follows that @xmath466 depends only on @xmath469 ( i.e. @xmath466 solves a suitable dirichlet problem with respect to the metric @xmath469 , with no reference to the original metric @xmath519 ) .",
    "therefore , proving that @xmath520 is equivalent to showing @xmath521 because there is nothing that distinguishes @xmath519 from any other metric @xmath469 in the flow .",
    "for @xmath387 , the function @xmath522 restricted to @xmath523 ( the exterior of @xmath410 in @xmath21 ) is just minus the green function of @xmath519 , defined as @xmath524 the total mass for a harmonically flat metric @xmath525 , can be computed directly from the behaviour of @xmath402 at infinity .",
    "namely , if @xmath526 then the adm mass is @xmath527 .",
    "the metric @xmath469 is of the form @xmath528 , with @xmath529 , where @xmath18 is the adm mass of @xmath519 . expanding the green function @xmath530 in the asymptotic region as @xmath531",
    ", it follows from a direct calculation that @xmath532 .",
    "thus , the mass will not increase provided @xmath533 .",
    "this turns out to be a general property of the green function @xmath530 of any asymptotically flat metric on a manifold with compact minimal boundary @xmath410 .",
    "this result , also due to bray @xcite , has independent interest and has been already used in another context by p. miao @xcite to characterize the schwarzschild initial data as the only static initial data with a non - empty minimal boundary .",
    "the proof of @xmath534 relies on the positive mass theorem and uses a technique first introduced by bunting and masood - ul - alam @xcite to prove uniqueness of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the idea is to double @xmath535 across its boundary @xmath410 ( i.e. take two copies and identify the boundaries ) to define a new manifold @xmath536 .",
    "define also a function @xmath537 on one of the copies and @xmath538 on the other copy .",
    "this defines a function which is harmonic away from @xmath410 ( which remains a minimal surface ) and which approaches @xmath539 on one asymptotic end and zero on the other asymptotic end .",
    "this function is also @xmath540 everywhere .",
    "consider the conformally rescaled metric @xmath541 on @xmath536 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath530 near the infinity where it vanishes shows that @xmath542 admits a one - point compactification there , thus defining a complete asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifold .",
    "furthermore , the behaviour of the curvature scalar under conformal rescalings and the fact that @xmath543 is harmonic implies that @xmath519 has non - negative curvature scalar away from @xmath410 . if @xmath544 were smooth , the positive mass theorem could be invoked to conclude that the mass of @xmath545 is non - negative , and zero if and only if @xmath542 is euclidean space . however , the metric @xmath545 is not smooth across @xmath410 and bray needs to use an approximation argument to reach the same conclusion .",
    "consequently , the adm mass of @xmath542 is non - negative .",

    ", it follows @xmath557 and the positive mass theorem proven by bray is recovered .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a related positive mass theorem has been proven using spinor techniques by shi and tam @xcite on spin manifolds in any dimension ( this entails no restriction in three dimensions , provided the manifold is orientable ) for metrics which are smooth on @xmath558 and on @xmath559 , only lipschitz across @xmath9 and such that equality in ( [ ineqh ] ) holds .",
    "returning to bray s proof of the penrose inequality , once the area of the horizons @xmath468 is known to be constant and that the mass does not increase , the final step is to show that the metric outside @xmath468 approaches the schwarzschild metric in a suitable sense .",
    "the surfaces @xmath468 flow outwards in @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , bray proves that , for sufficiently large @xmath409 , @xmath468 encloses any bounded set of @xmath523 .",
    "thus , the shrinking manifold @xmath470 behaves in such a way that any given point @xmath560 is left out for a sufficiently large @xmath409 .",
    "it may seem , therefore , that this manifold disappears in the limit . here",
    "is where the asymptotic condition @xmath561 at infinity comes into play .",
    "for very large @xmath409 , the asymptotic value of the conformal factor @xmath462 also tends to zero .",
    "thus , vectors that were unit at large distances in the original metric @xmath519 have increasingly smaller lengths in the metric @xmath469 . however , this metric is also asymptotically euclidean , so for a suitable choice of coordinates , the metric must approach the flat metric in cartesian coordinates . in these coordinates , the region @xmath470",
    "shrinks more slowly ( or it may even expand ) . in order to see why is this so , consider the metric defined by @xmath562 on the domain @xmath563 with @xmath564 as @xmath565 .",
    "the domain is shrinking in the coordinates @xmath566 .",

    "the domain is @xmath569 which is not shrinking if @xmath570 grows at most as @xmath571 .",
    "this is the type of behaviour that occurs to the conformal flow of metrics introduced by bray .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by considering the flow in the particular case when the starting metric is the schwarzschild manifold ( [ gsch ] ) .",
    "rotational symmetry allows one to integrate the equations easily .",
    "the flow of metrics @xmath469 in the exterior domain @xmath572 are , for @xmath461 , @xcite .",
    "@xmath573 the exterior domain indeed shrinks in these coordinates .",
    "however , performing the coordinate transformation ( or the diffeomorphism if an active point of view is preferred ) @xmath574 , with @xmath575 and @xmath576 unchanged , the exterior region is transformed back into the original exterior part of the schwarzschild manifold .",
    "the metric ( [ flowschw ] ) in the region already swapped by the surfaces @xmath577 is cylinder - like in the sense that each surface @xmath578 has the same area .",
    "this is a general property of bray s flow , since each of the surfaces @xmath468 has the same area as the starting horizon .",
    "the behaviour in the exterior part is also general .",
    "the idea is that since the surface @xmath468 grows unboundedly , eventually it swallows all the interior geometric features of @xmath535 and leaves only the asymptotic geometry .",
    "since the mass does not increase along the flow of metrics , its limit exists and is non - negative due to the positive mass theorem .",
    "bray proves that the limit mass is , in fact , positive and hence the geometry in the exterior approximates schwarzschild with increasing accuracy .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the conformal factor @xmath561 has the effect that this exterior remains unbounded , in the sense that after performing the appropriate diffeomorphism , all the surfaces @xmath468 stay within a bounded set .",
    "more precisely , bray shows that for each @xmath579 there exists a @xmath580 so that for @xmath581 there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath582 between @xmath583 and the exterior region @xmath584 of a fixed schwarzschild manifold @xmath345 of mass @xmath585 , such that both metrics are @xmath451-close to each other ( in the sense that the length of any unit vector of the metric @xmath469 has length in the interval @xmath586 for the metric @xmath587 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath517 and @xmath585 also differ at most by @xmath451 .",

    "first , regularity of minimal surfaces holds only for dimensions @xmath547 , and the outermost minimal surface enclosure of @xmath410 , which is a crucial ingredient in the method , needs to be smooth for the argument to go through .",

    "thus , according to the author , it becomes impossible to compare the limit value of geroch mass with the value of the total mass of the manifold , which makes the inverse mean curvature flow inconclusive for the penrose inequality . despite this failure of the inverse mean curvature method to prove the inequality ( [ pihyperbolic ] ) ,",

    "it is also interesting to note that the penrose inequality in the hyperbolic setting may be a powerful tool to address the uniqueness problem of asymptotically hyperbolic static initial data sets @xcite .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath655 the square norm of the static killing vector and by @xmath656 the geroch mass of the level sets of @xmath655 , it is proven in @xcite that the validity of the penrose inequality @xmath657 implies a uniqueness theorem for the generalized kottler metric in the case that @xmath633 if of genus larger than one and @xmath9 is connected .",
    "the reason is that in the static setting , the geroch mass @xmath658 can be bounded _ above _ in terms of the mass of the generalized kottler solution with the same surface gravity @xmath659 ( provided this satisfies the inequality @xmath660 ) .",

    "however , the only static initial data set which saturates ( [ uniq ] ) turns out to be the @xmath630 slice of the kottler metric .",
    "thus a proof of the penrose inequality for @xmath656 would establish a uniqueness result for static initial data sets in the hyperbolic setting .",
    "the validity of the penrose inequality for arbitrary initial data sets ( with an arbitrary second fundamental form and without the assumption of spherical symmetry ) is still open .",
    "the proofs by huisken and ilmanen and bray of the riemannian penrose inequality involve manifolds @xmath21 with a positive definite metric of non - negative curvature scalar admitting an outermost minimal surface .",
    "although primarily intended to cover the time - symmetric case , the proofs only require the presence of a minimal surface and a riemannian metric with non - negative scalar of curvature .",
    "thus , the method also gives useful results in the case of maximal hypersurfaces , @xmath661 ( assuming the energy density @xmath132 in ( [ hamiltonianconst ] ) to be non - negative ) , provided the riemannian manifold contains at least a bounding minimal surface .",
    "the riemannian arguments in the previous section , however , do not settle the general penrose inequality in the maximal hypersurface case for two reasons : firstly because they would give a lower bound for the adm energy instead of the adm mass and secondly because the outermost minimal surface does not coincide , in general , with any of the minimal area enclosures arising in any of the versions of the penrose inequalities discussed in sect .",
    "[ formulations ] ( except in the time - symmetric case , of course ) .",
    "although the general penrose inequality remains open , several methods have been proposed to address it .",
    "we devote this section to discuss them .",
    "as described in the introduction , penrose s original setup @xcite to test the validity of cosmic censorship consisted of a shell of matter moving inwards at the speed of light in a flat spacetime .",
    "the shell is assumed to have closed and connected cross sections and the matter within the shell is made of null dust ( meaning that the particles defining the shell are massless and that all pressures vanish ) . in order to have a flat metric inside the imploding shell , all points in their interior must be causally disconnected ( to the past ) with all points on the shell . choosing a minkowskian time @xmath409 inside the shell",
    ", this demands that , to the past of some @xmath662 , the null hypersurface @xmath27 swept by the incoming shell of matter must be free of self - intersections .",
    "since the matter within the shell is moving at the speed of light , the cross section @xmath663 can be viewed , after the natural identification of points in different instants of time , as the surface lying at distance @xmath664 from @xmath665 , where distance is positive to the exterior and negative to the interior ( the fact that @xmath665 separates euclidean space into an interior and an exterior is always true as a consequence of the jordan - brower separation theorem for smooth hypersurfaces in @xmath666 , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the distance level function from a given closed surface in euclidean space is smooth everywhere in its exterior if and only if the surface is convex ( i.e. it has non - negative principal curvatures ) .",
    "the setup , therefore , requires that the null hypersurface has one cross section @xmath665 which is convex .",
    "this property is then true for all @xmath667 . towards the future",
    ", @xmath27 will become singular at the first focal point of the incoming null geodesics .",
    "a spacetime singularity will form there . outside the null shell ,",
    "the metric is no longer flat , in particular because gravitational waves may be emitted by the collapsing dust .",
    "penrose devised this physical process as a potential counterexample to the inequality ( [ pi1 ] ) .",
    "the fundamental simplification of this problem is that the inequality can be translated into an inequality directly in minkowski space , as follows @xcite :    let @xmath52 be the future directed null tangent to @xmath27 normalized to satisfy @xmath668 , where , as above , @xmath409 is a minkowskian time in the interior part of the shell .",
    "take any closed , spacelike surface embedded in @xmath27 and let @xmath51 be its future null normal satisfying @xmath669 .",
    "the energy momentum of the spacetime is a distribution supported on @xmath27 which reads @xmath670 , where @xmath671 is the energy density of the shell and the dirac @xmath672 is defined with respect to the volume form @xmath673 induced by the normal @xmath674 to @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath675 where @xmath676 and @xmath677 is a coordinate expression for the embedding of @xmath27 ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "the null expansion @xmath74 jumps across @xmath27 .",
    "the jump can be determined using the raychaudhuri equation ( [ lthetal ] ) .",
    "one way of doing this is by extending the null vector @xmath94 to a geodesic null congruence and taking its divergence on each side of the shell .",
    "this defines the null expansion @xmath74 as a discontinuous function on the spacetime .",
    "a distribution can then be introduced as @xmath678 , where @xmath679 is th standard heaviside distribution ( it acts on tests functions by integration on the domain outside the shell ) and the superscript @xmath680 stands for interior ( exterior ) of the shell . since @xmath681 ,",

    "the raychaudhuri equation ( [ lthetal ] ) , which in this case is a distributional equation , has a singular part supported on @xmath27 only through the term @xmath685 .",
    "the jump must therefore satisfy @xmath686 .    for an arbitrary surface embedded within a null hypersurface , the expansion along the null direction tangent to the hypersurface coincides with the null expansion of the hypersurface .",
    "this means , in particular , that it only depends on the point where it is calculated but not on the specific surface passing through that point .",
    "this has as immediate consequence that the incoming null expansion @xmath70 of the shell is continuous across the shell . on the surface @xmath665",
    ", the null expansion @xmath70 coincides with the mean curvature of @xmath665 as a surface of euclidean space with respect to the inner normal and it is therefore non - positive ( since @xmath665 is convex ) and not everywhere zero ( since @xmath665 is closed ) .",
    "it follows from the raychaudhuri equation that @xmath66 everywhere on @xmath27 . consequently , right after the shell has passed , a spacelike surface @xmath687 is marginally outer trapped ( i.e. @xmath688 ) if and only if it is marginally future trapped .",
    "assume such an @xmath9 exists along the shell .",
    "we want to show that the penrose heuristic argument based on cosmic censorship then implies @xmath689 where @xmath690 is the bondi mass ( see e.g. @xcite for its definition ) of past null infinity at the cut defined by @xmath27 . indeed , under cosmic censorship the singularity that necessarily forms in the future is shielded from infinity by an event horizon .",
    "since @xmath9 must be contained in the black hole region , the intersection @xmath6 of the event horizon with @xmath27 must lie completely in the causal past of @xmath9 .",
    "using the fact that the null expansion @xmath691 is non - positive , this implies @xmath692 .",
    "since the standard heuristic argument gives @xmath693 , the claim above follows .",
    "notice that , in this case , the inequality is expected to hold for @xmath9 irrespectively of whether or not this surface is area outer minimizing with respect to any spacelike slice .",
    "using now the conservation equation @xmath694 ( which holds in distributional sense , see e.g. @xcite ) ) , it follows that the integral @xmath695 does not depend on the cut @xmath696 of @xmath27 .",
    "evaluating this integral at past null infinity gives precisely the bondi mass ( this can be easily shown for instance using the hawking mass introduced in subsect .",
    "[ uef ] ) .",
    "using now that @xmath9 is marginally outer trapped from the exterior , we have , after defining @xmath697 , @xmath698 where the last step is precisely the penrose inequality in this setting .",
    "thus , the penrose inequality for incoming shells can be rewritten as @xmath699 which has the remarkable property of making no reference to the exterior geometry at all .",
    "since the density @xmath671 is freely specifiable , this inequality should hold for any closed spacelike surfaces @xmath9 in minkowski spacetime for which the null hypersurface generated by past directed and outer null geodesics orthogonal to @xmath9 remains regular everywhere .",
    "a similar inequality can be derived in any spacetime dimension @xcite .    in the particular case of a surface lying on the past null cone of a point @xmath42 ,",
    "the surface @xmath9 can be described by a single positive function @xmath238 which measures the distance to @xmath42 ( after projection to a constant time hypersurface ) .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives the outer null expansion @xmath74 and the inequality ( [ shells ] ) becomes @xmath700 where all geometric objects refer to the standard metric of unit radius on the sphere .",
    "this inequality already appears in @xcite and a more detailed derivation can be found in @xcite .",
    "its validity ( in fact of a stronger version ) was proven by tod @xcite as a consequence of the sobolev inequality applied to a suitable class of functions on @xmath701 ( see @xcite for a different proof which gives an even stronger inequality ) .",

    "thesis , this inequality is exactly the minkowski inequality for convex bodies in euclidean space , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this settles the penrose inequality when @xmath9 lies on a constant time hyperplane @xcite .",
    "the range of validity of the minkowski inequality ( [ minkowskiineq ] ) has been extended by trudinger @xcite , to cover all mean convex bodies in euclidean space , i.e. all closed surfaces with @xmath703 .",

    "the projection @xmath696 can be seen to have at least the same area as @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath704 .",
    "furthermore , by direct calculation , the author finds that the mean curvature @xmath705 of the projected surface is non - negative and that @xmath706 .",
    "thus , the penrose inequality would follow from trudinger s version of the minkowski inequality .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation leading to @xmath707 and @xmath706 contains an error which invalidates the argument . instead of going into the details of the derivation , it is simpler to just notice that one can easily construct a surface on a null hypersurface @xmath27 in minkowski spacetime which has a projection @xmath696 which is not mean convex . consider the past null cone of a point at @xmath708 , and consider the sphere obtained as the cross section of @xmath27 with @xmath630 .",

    "it is easy to construct surfaces @xmath696 which are not mean convex .",
    "consider , for instance , a surface of revolution defined by @xmath711 with equatorial symmetry and with a neck on the equator ( i.e. such that @xmath711 is symmetric under @xmath712 and @xmath713 is a local maximum ) .",
    "the principal curvatures on a point on the equator are simply @xmath714 and @xmath715 , where @xmath716 is the second derivative of @xmath711 at the equator .",

    "bergqvist @xcite shows that this can indeed be done but only under the assumption that the induced metric @xmath744 of the surface @xmath729 becomes round at infinity in the sense that @xmath745 , where @xmath746 is the standard unit metric on the sphere . at present , it is not clear how restrictive is this requirement .",
    "the idea however remains interesting and deserves further investigation .",
    "the success of proving the riemannian penrose inequality in the connected horizon case using the monotonicity of the geroch mass under the ( weak ) inverse mean curvature flow suggests a possible scenario for approaching the penrose inequality in the general case . as discussed in subsect .",
    "[ uef ] , the hawking mass ( [ hawmass ] ) is a functional on surfaces which coincides with the geroch mass in the time symmetric context .",
    "moreover , the hawking mass ( with @xmath212 ) takes the value @xmath747 on any topological 2-sphere which is either a marginally outer trapped surface , a past marginally outer trapped surface , or a generalized apparent horizon ( all of which have null mean curvature vector ) .",
    "moreover , as discussed in subsect .",
    "[ uef ] , under suitable spacetime variations of a given surface , the hawking mass is monotonically increasing @xcite . since its numerical value for large coordinate spheres in the asymptotically euclidean region approaches the adm energy , a flow which interpolates between the horizon and infinity and falls into any of the four monotonicity cases discussed in sect ( [ uef ] ) would imply the general penrose inequality between the adm energy and the area of the horizon . among the four cases , the closest one to the riemannian inverse mean curvature flow is the so - called `` uniformly expanding flow '' , defined by ( [ flowvector ] ) .    with these monotonicity properties , the situation regarding the general penrose inequality",
    "can be compared to the status of the riemannian penrose inequality after geroch s heuristic argument .",
    "it is conceivable that the uniformly expanding flows might be useful for the proof of the general penrose inequality .",
    "however , many issues remain open .",
    "for instance , in a spacetime formulation , the jumps that occurred in the riemannian setting will remain , but it is unclear how and when the jumps should take place , even from a purely heuristic point of view .",
    "moreover , the inverse mean curvature flow is a parabolic equation in the riemannian setting , so that local existence is guaranteed , but the situation is quite different for the uniformly expanding flows .",
    "local existence in this case has been proven only for null flows , i.e. @xmath748 .",
    "a null flow will obviously not reach spacelike infinity . nevertheless , assuming that a sufficiently large portion of the spacetime is at hand",
    ", this null flow could be used to study the penrose inequality involving the bondi mass .",
    "the difficulty , however , is that the uniformly expanding null flow seems to have the tendency to deform the surface in such a way that the mean curvature vector becomes causal at some places , even if one starts with a surface with spacelike mean curvature everywhere .",
    "this behaviour is observed in explicit examples in minkowski spacetime ( provided the surfaces do not lie on a constant time hyperplane and in fact cover a sufficiently large time interval ) .",
    "one alternative that may still give interesting results is to use a flow which is null and future directed for some interval and then continue with a null _ past directed _ uniformly expanding flow , then with a _ future _ directed null flow , and so on .",
    "this flow can be constructed in a tubular neighbourhood of the given initial data set , and therefore does not need strong global assumptions on the spacetime .",
    "moreover , it is conceivable that this broken flow can approach spacelike infinity .",
    "however , it is not clear which criterion should be used to stop the future flow and continue with the past one ( and viceversa ) .",
    "moreover , the construction must be such that the mean curvature vector remains spacelike everywhere in order to ensure monotonicity of the hawking mass .",
    "regarding the non - null case , @xmath749 , the flow equations form a so - called forward - backward parabolic system , for which no local existence theory is known ( this was noted by huisken and ilmanen @xcite in the case @xmath199 and was extended to arbitrary @xmath220 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is , of course , a major difficulty and addressing it would require a much better understanding of this type of partial differential equations . in huisken and ilmanen s work , a fundamental part of the analysis dealt with the level set formulation , which gives a degenerate elliptic equation .",
    "more specifically , the existence of a variational formulation turned out to be a fundamental ingredient to solve the problem of existence and to study the jumps . remarkably ,",
    "the uniformly expanding flows also admit a variational formulation @xcite .",
    "the new basic ingredient is that the field to be varied is not just the level set function @xmath407 ( see ( [ funct1 ] ) ) as in the riemannian case , but also the spacelike hypersurface @xmath21 where this function is defined . whether this variational formulation can give useful hints on how to define",
    "the jumps remains an open and difficult problem .",
    "it should be remarked in this context that the simplest spacelike uniformly expanding flow corresponds to @xmath199 , i.e. @xmath200 ( @xmath750 can be chosen without loss of generality ) .",
    "the flow vector is therefore the inverse mean curvature vector . in terms of initial data information @xmath751",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath752 ( this condition has been often termed `` polar gauge '' in the literature ) . assuming this gauge condition and a second restriction which turns out to coincide with the inverse mean curvature flow condition @xmath753 jezierski was able to prove @xcite the penrose inequality for small ( but non - linear ) electrovacuum perturbations of the reisner - nordstrm time - symmetric initial data outside the black hole event horizon .",
    "his method was based on writing the hamiltonian constraint as a divergence term plus a non - positive reminder .",
    "the penrose inequality is established by integrating this equation between the event horizon and infinity after using the gauss theorem to transform the divergence into a surface integral at infinity and on the horizon ( the former gives the adm energy and the latter the area term in the inequality ) .",
    "although jezierski s argument does not use the monotonicity of the hawking mass , the calculation does in fact correspond to the general identity ( [ dmh2 ] ) specialized to the case at hand .",
    "with hindsight , one can therefore conclude that this monotonicity property of the hawking mass is the underlying reason why the argument works .",
    "jezierski supports the plausibility of the gauge conditions @xmath752 and @xmath754 by studying linear perturbations of reissner - nordstrm , where he finds that the two equations decouple , one giving a parabolic equation that needs to be integrated radially outwards and another one also parabolic but which needs to be integrated radially inwards .",
    "this is , of course , a manifestation of the forward - backward parabolic nature of the full system .",
    "a similar existence result for linear , axial ( i.e. odd ) perturbations of maximal slices of the schwarzschild spacetime has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "another observation worth mentioning regarding",
    "the inverse mean curvature vector flow ( i.e. @xmath199 ) is that the monotonicity formula turns out to be insensitive to the value of the energy flux @xmath133 .",
    "if follows that the weak energy condition is already sufficient to ensure monotonicity of the hawking mass in this context . in principle this opens up the possibility that the full penrose inequality might be true for spacetimes satisfying just the weak energy condition .",
    "this is not so , however .",
    "an explicit counterexample for scalar field initial data has been constructed by v. husain @xcite .",
    "schoen and yau s proof of the positive mass theorem proceeded in two steps .",
    "first , the purely riemannian case ( i.e. vanishing second fundamental form ) was solved by using minimal surface techniques . in a second step ,",
    "the general case @xmath153 was treated by modifying the metric @xmath120 with a transformation introduced by jang @xcite , namely @xmath755 where @xmath756 solves the so - called _ jang equation _",
    "@xmath757 this transformation has the property that the curvature scalar of @xmath545 has a lower bound that allows to prove existence of a conformal factor @xmath758 such that the conformally rescaled metric @xmath759 has vanishing scalar curvature .",
    "this metric is still asymptotically euclidean and has at most the same mass as the original metric .",
    "the riemannian positive mass theorem then gives the desired result .",
    "the proof is however involved because the jang equation does not admit regular solutions when the initial data set @xmath153 contains marginally trapped surfaces , but the idea can nevertheless be made to work @xcite .",
    "a natural question , already asked in @xcite , is whether a similar idea can be applied to prove the general penrose inequality .",
    "the penrose inequality has already been proven in full generality in the riemannian setting so the present status is similar to the situation of the proof of the positive mass theorem after its riemannian proof .",
    "this idea has been analyzed by malec and  murchadha @xcite .",
    "their argument is based on the observation that , if the jang equation could be used to prove the general penrose inequality , it should be able to do so in the particular case of spherical symmetry . restricting to spherically symmetric functions @xmath756 ,",
    "the jang equation becomes a simple ode and existence of regular solutions in the exterior region outside the full trapped region @xmath287 can be easily shown .",
    "the difficulty of the method is that along the process ( jang s transformation and subsequent conformal rescaling ) the mass of the manifold should not increase and the area of the outermost horizon @xmath760 should not decrease .",
    "this is because one wants to use the riemannian penrose inequality for the final manifold and conclude that the same inequality holds in the original initial data .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath9 must be transformed into a minimal surface after the conformal rescaling .",
    "the simplest situation where this can be achieved is by demanding that @xmath9 becomes minimal already for the jang transformed metric @xmath761 .",
    "this requires that the outer normal derivative of @xmath756 diverges to either @xmath762 or to @xmath763 on @xmath9 . in the first case",
    ", it follows that the metric @xmath545 has a cylindrical end near @xmath9 .",
    "the conformal transformation is expected to compactify this end with one point ( this behaviour was found in @xcite , and this was important in order to apply the riemannian positive mass theorem ) . hence , the area of @xmath9 decreases in the process ( it vanishes in the final manifold ) and nothing can be concluded . in the second case ( outer normal derivative of @xmath756 diverging to @xmath764 ) the conformal factor @xmath161",
    "is expected to have an interior local minimum .",
    "this would imply that the outer normal derivative of @xmath161 is negative on @xmath9 , and hence that this surface is not the outermost minimal surface in the final manifold .",
    "thus , the riemannian penrose inequality applied to the final manifold is again inconclusive for the original one .",
    "although these arguments are not definitive in discarding the jang equation method for the penrose inequality , they indeed show that difficulties should be expected for the method to work , at least when @xmath9 is required to transform to a minimal surface by the jang transformation .",
    "the situation where @xmath9 is minimal only after the final conformal transformation is not considered in @xcite and should be further investigated .",
    "very recently , the jang equation has been successfully applied to prove a penrose - like inequality in the spirit of herzlich s inequality discussed in subsect .",
    "[ spinors ] , but allowing non - vanishing second fundamental form .",
    "the class of initial data @xmath153 under consideration are such that @xmath765 with @xmath229 compact and @xmath398 an asymptotically euclidean end .",
    "the boundary @xmath347 is compact and consisting of a finite collection of future mots ( with respect to the normal pointing towards @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , no weakly future or past trapped surface strictly enclosing @xmath347 is allowed to exist in @xmath21 . in other words , @xmath347 is the outermost mots in @xmath21 and , moreover , no past weakly outer trapped boundary is allowed to exist in @xmath21 except possibly @xmath347 itself .",
    "assuming also that @xmath153 satisfies the dominant energy condition @xmath129 , khuri has recently proven @xcite that the penrose - like inequality @xmath766 holds , where @xmath475 is the number of connected components of @xmath347 and the scale invariant quantity @xmath767 is defined as @xmath768 the infimum is taken with respect to functions @xmath407 with approach one at infinity and zero on @xmath347 .",
    "the metric @xmath769 is constructed using the jang transformation ( [ jangtrans ] ) and @xmath756 is a solution of the jang equation approaching zero at infinity and blowing up to @xmath770 on @xmath347 .",
    "the existence of such an @xmath756 has been established by metzger in @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath756 at infinity is such that @xmath771 is asymptotically euclidean and @xmath772 . since @xmath773 on @xmath347 ,",

    "the idea is to conformally transform @xmath769 outside @xmath775 in such a way that the conformally rescaled metric @xmath776 is still asymptotically euclidean , with vanishing curvature scalar and such that each connected component @xmath777 of @xmath775 satisfies @xmath778 , where @xmath779 is the mean curvature of @xmath777 with respect to @xmath780 ( and the area is also calculated with this metric ) .",
    "existence of @xmath781 is established as a consequence of the positivity properties of @xmath782 and the blowing up behavior of @xmath756 at @xmath347 .",
    "the conformal rescaling is such that the adm energy decreases by an amount which is at least equal to the right - hand side of ( [ khuriineq ] ) except for terms that vanish in the limit @xmath783 .",
    "the only remaining step to conclude ( [ khuriineq ] ) is that the adm energy of @xmath784 is non - negative . but this is precisely the content of the positive mass theorem proven by herzlich @xcite for asymptotically euclidean manifolds with a connected boundary of spherical topology and satisfying ( [ inequalitymeancurvature ] ) .",
    "khuri notices that this positive mass theorem still holds if the boundary has a finite number of connected components of spherical topology , each one satisfying the bound ( [ inequalitymeancurvature ] ) . in the case at hand , this inequality is satisfied ( in fact , saturated ) by construction and the spherical topology is guaranteed by galloway and schoen s results @xcite on the topology of outermost mots .    comparing this penrose - like inequality with the difficulties described by malec and  murchadha to use the jang transformation to prove the general penrose inequality in spherical symmetry , the main difference is that this method ultimately relies on a positive mass theorem , instead of on the riemannian penrose inequality .",
    "thus , there is no need to obtain an outermost minimal boundary after the metric is modified by the jang transformation and the subsequent conformal rescaling .      very recently",
    "bray and khuri have made an important step forward towards establishing the general penrose inequality .",
    "as mentioned in sect . [ formulations ] , these authors propose to use generalized apparent horizons as the appropriate surfaces for which the penrose inequality should hold .",
    "an important guiding principle that led bray and khuri to make this conjecture is related to the fact that , independently of which method for proving the inequality is used , the estimates involved must all give equality whenever @xmath153 is any of the slices of the kruskal spacetime for which equality holds .",
    "therefore , a preliminary issue of importance is : for which slices of the kruskal spacetime should equality be expected ?",
    "any spacelike cauchy slice @xmath21 of the kruskal spacetime must intersect both the black hole and the white hole event horizons . in kruskal coordinates ,",
    "the metric reads ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath785 where @xmath786 and @xmath787 is defined by @xmath788 ( our sign convention for @xmath402 is different to that in @xcite ) .",
    "the null vectors @xmath789 and @xmath790 are future directed , the black hole event horizon is located at @xmath791 , the white hole event horizon at @xmath792 and the domain of outer communications @xmath793 is located at @xmath794 . if the boundary of @xmath795 satisfies @xmath791 everywhere , then @xmath796 is an area outer minimizing mots .",
    "moreover , since its area is @xmath797 and there are no other weakly outer trapped surfaces ( future or past ) in @xmath798 , it follows that this slice satisfies any of the versions of the penrose inequality ( [ piheut+ ] ) , ( [ piheut- ] ) or ( [ pit ] ) .",
    "it also satisfies the inequality involving generalized apparent horizons ( [ pikhuribray ] ) provided there are no generalized trapped surfaces in @xmath798 ( this is plausible although not yet proven , as far as i know ) .",
    "similar things happen if @xmath792 everywhere on the boundary of @xmath798 .",
    "however , it neither @xmath402 and @xmath407 are identically zero on @xmath799 , the situation is quite different . in this case",
    "the boundary @xmath796 is neither a future or past mots and , in most cases , it is not even smooth .",
    "moreover , the intersection of @xmath21 with the @xmath800 hypersurface ( which is always a mots and has area @xmath797 ) is not area outer minimizing because its mean curvature @xmath42 is negative whenever @xmath801 ( i.e. on the points lying in the white hole event horizon with respect to the second asymptotically flat spacetime region ) .",
    "thus , its minimal area enclosure has strictly less area .",
    "consequently , the version ( [ piheut+ ] ) of the penrose inequality holds but _ not _ with equality ( this statement assumes that @xmath802 is the outermost mots of the slice , which is again plausible but not yet proven , as far as i know ) .",
    "it follows that not all slices of the kruskal spacetime are automatically equality cases , at least for the version ( [ piheut+ ] ) .",
    "obviously , the more slices of kruskal satisfy equality , the sharper is the version of the penrose inequality , in the sense of being capable of identifying the kruskal spacetime in a larger number of cases .",
    "a version that gives equality for any slice of the kruskal spacetime is ( [ pit ] ) , even when the boundary of @xmath798 is non - smooth .",
    "although , as already mentioned , no counterexample of this version has been found , its validity would however come as a surprise because the minimal area enclosure of @xmath803 may a priori have much smaller area than itself .",
    "the alternative put forward by bray and khuri involves generalized trapped surfaces .",
    "this has the advantage that , as soon as @xmath798 has a smooth boundary , this is a generalized trapped surface ( in fact , a generalized apparent horizon ) .",
    "eichmair s result , see subsect . [ embedded ] , implies that an outermost generalized apparent horizon must exist on @xmath21 .",
    "it is highly plausible that @xmath796 is in fact the outermost apparent horizon in this case .",
    "since its area is @xmath797 , any slice with smooth @xmath796 would belong to the equality case of the penrose inequality ( [ pikhuribray ] ) .",
    "if the boundary @xmath796 is not smooth , then it can not be its own minimal area enclosure , and hence it can not give equality neither in ( [ piheut+ ] ) nor in ( [ piheut- ] ) .",
    "these considerations led bray and khuri to conjecture the following version of the penrose inequality ( recall that our definition of asymptotically euclidean requires in particular that @xmath804 is complete and that an initial data set is called * schwarzschild at infinity * if outside a compact set , the metric @xmath30 is exactly schwarzchild , c.f . the discussion after ( [ epsilonchange ] ) ) .",

    "an important question regarding the plausibility of conjecture [ braykhuriconjecture ] was posed by r. wald @xcite who asked whether there are any generalized apparent horizons in minkowski spacetime ( the question of whether surfaces with causal mean curvature can exist in minkowski spacetime was already asked in @xcite in a somewhat different context ) .",

    "a fundamental observation of bray and khuri is that , since the equality case of the penrose inequality should correspond to the schwarzschild metric , the jang equation should be accordingly modified so that it holds identically for slices in this spacetime .",

    "returning to the general case , whenever the generalized jang equation is satisfied , the curvature scalar of @xmath818 reduces to @xmath858 this expression has no sign in general , so the riemannian penrose inequality can not be applied directly .",
    "however , the generalized jang equation involves two unknowns , so it must be supplemented by a second condition in order to have a determined problem .",
    "bray and khuri discuss two possibilities .",
    "the simplest one consists in putting equal to zero the last summand in ( [ ricciunderjang ] ) , i.e. @xmath859 the two equations ( [ genjangeq])-([divergence ] ) are called the _ jang - zero divergence equations _ in @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ divergence ] ) is third order in @xmath756 .",
    "however , after substracting suitable derivatives of ( [ genjangeq ] ) it can be converted into a second order equation for @xmath756 ( with quadratic second derivatives ) .",
    "the resulting system is degenerate elliptic .",
    "bray and khuri conjecture that the system admits solutions with appropriate behaviour at infinity and such that @xmath347 is a minimal surface with respect to @xmath818 . under this conjecture ,",
    "the penrose inequality as stated in ( [ braykhuriconjecture-2 ] ) follows ( modulo a technical point regarding the equality case , see conjecture 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the second possibility is based on the observation that , while ( [ genjangeq ] ) does not imply @xmath860 , the integrated inequality @xmath861 follows from ( [ ricciunderjang ] ) under suitable decay conditions at infinity and restrictions on @xmath347 .",
    "bray and khuri make the interesting observation that in any situation ( irrespective of whether @xmath830 or not ) where the mass @xmath862 can be shown to satisfy @xmath863 with some @xmath864 , then the prescription @xmath865 implies @xmath866 and hence the penrose inequality ( [ ineq ] ) provided @xmath867 .",
    "the question is , therefore , under which circumstances a general type inequality of the form ( [ generaltype ] ) holds . as the authors point out",
    ", any such inequality would imply the riemannian penrose inequality as a particular case .",
    "it is therefore natural to study whether the known proofs of the riemannian penrose inequality are capable of establishing the validity of ( [ generaltype ] ) for some @xmath868 .",
    "the authors show explicitly that this is indeed the case for the huisken and ilmanen method , provided the second homology class of @xmath21 is trivial and @xmath347 is connected .",
    "the idea is to integrate ( [ dmg ] ) with respect to @xmath86 and convert the double integral ( in @xmath86 and on @xmath90 ) as a volume integral . by using the weak formulation in terms of level sets ,",
    "this can be accomplished even along the jumps .",
    "the result is that latexmath:[$q = | \\overline{\\nabla } u |_{\\ggamma } \\sqrt{e^u    solution of the inverse mean curvature flow equal to zero on @xmath347 .",
    "thus , existence of appropriate solutions for the pair of equations ( [ genjangeq ] ) and @xmath870 implies the general penrose inequality ( [ ineq ] ) for connected @xmath347 ( assuming that @xmath21 has trivial second homology class ) . as noted by the authors , existence in this case looks harder than for the jang - zero divergence system because @xmath871 vanishes identically wherever the inverse mean curvature flow jumps .",
    "the equation therefore implies @xmath872 on the jumps .",
    "however , if @xmath756 stays smooth , then @xmath873 there ( see ( [ newsecform ] ) ) .",
    "but then , the generalized jang equation ( [ genjangeq ] ) requires @xmath661 along the jumps , which is a condition on the initial data and not an equation .",
    "thus , existence of classical solutions of the system @xmath874 and ( [ genjangeq ] ) should not be expected in general .",
    "it may be , however , that existence can be granted if @xmath756 is allowed to be unbounded ( or even undefined ) in suitable regions .    the other existing method to prove",
    "the riemannian penrose inequality is the conformal flow of metrics due to bray @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this method is also capable of producing an inequality of the form ( [ generaltype ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath871 is expected to be continuous and strictly positive outside @xmath808 . on the other hand ,",
    "the resulting equation @xmath865 is not local , in the sense that it does not define a local p.d.e . at each point .",
    "existence of the coupled system with the generalized jang equations appears to be difficult in this case as well .",
    "the penrose inequality can be strengthened under some circumstances , in particular when suitable matter fields are present in the spacetime . in order to understand heuristically why this is to be expected ,",
    "let us return to the original argument by penrose based on cosmic censorship .",
    "assume that the collapsing matter is electrically charged and that the end - state of the collapse is a black hole in equilibrium .",
    "in this situation , all the matter sources of the electromagnetic field are expected to lie within the event horizon and the black hole is therefore electrovacuum in its exterior . according to the black hole uniqueness result ,",
    "the end - state is therefore a kerr - newman black hole .",
    "the area of any cut of the event horizon in this spacetime is given by @xmath875 where @xmath16 is the total angular momentum of the final state and @xmath871 the total electric charge . from ( [ kn ] )",
    "it follows immediately @xmath876 which makes no reference to the angular momentum . since the total electric charge of the spacetime",
    "is conserved provided no charged matter escapes to infinity , the penrose heuristic argument implies that any asymptotically euclidean electrovacuum initial data set should satisfy the inequality @xmath877 in the time symmetric case , the electrovacuum initial data reduces to the triple @xmath878 , where the electric field @xmath879 satisfies @xmath880 .",
    "the total charge is defined as @xmath881 where @xmath9 is homologous to any large sphere in the asymptotically euclidean end .",
    "the inequality ( [ picharged ] ) simplifies to @xmath882 where @xmath329 is the outermost minimal surface . for this inequality to make sense",
    "it is necessary that @xmath883 for all electrovacuum initial data . this is a strengthening of the positive mass theorem in the presence of electromagnetic fields and",
    "was first proven in @xcite ( see @xcite for a generalization including matter and @xcite for a rigorous statement ) .",
    "the minimum value of the right - hand side of ( [ pichargedsym ] ) is @xmath884 .",
    "thus , for horizons of small area ( @xmath885 ) the penrose inequality ( [ pichargedsym ] ) reduces to the positive mass theorem @xmath883 , with no reference to the area of the horizon .",
    "this implies , in particular , that ( [ pichargedsym ] ) does not admit an equality case ( i.e. a rigidity statement ) for horizons of small area . on the other hand",
    ", the equality case in the penrose inequality @xmath886 has the interesting consequence of providing a variational characterization of the schwarzschild metric ( [ gsch ] ) as the absolute minimum of total mass among asymptotically euclidean , riemannian manifolds of non - negative ricci scalar and with an outermost minimal surface of given area @xmath887 .",
    "this is similar to the variational characterization of euclidean space as the absolute minimum of total mass among asymptotically euclidean riemannian manifolds with @xmath450 .",
    "a natural question is whether there exists another version of the charged riemannian penrose inequality which is able to give a variational characterization ( among metrics of fixed charge and fixed area of the outermost minimal surface ) of the reisner - nordstrm and papapetrou - majumdar metrics , which are the only static and electrovacuum black holes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a strengthening of ( [ pichargedsym ] ) that has been proposed is @xmath888 this inequality was first discussed and proven by jang @xcite in the case of asymptotically euclidean , electrovacuum initial data sets @xmath889 with a _ connected _ outermost minimal surface @xmath298 , provided the inverse mean curvature flow starting on @xmath298 remains smooth .",
    "this last requirement is , in fact , unnecessary thanks to the weak formulation of the flow introduced by huisken and ilmanen .",
    "this establishes ( [ pichargedcon ] ) for connected @xmath298 .",
    "inequality ( [ pichargedcon ] ) is , however , not generally true when the outermost minimal surface is allowed to have several connected components .",
    "a counterexample has been found by weinstein and yamada @xcite .",
    "their basic idea was to realize that the papapetrou - majumdar spacetime , which represents a static configuration of @xmath890 black holes of masses @xmath891 and charges @xmath892 , with @xmath893 , has the property that the total area @xmath10 of the event horizon violates the inequality ( [ pichargedcon ] ) .",
    "indeed , using @xmath894 , it follows @xmath895 irrespectively of the value of @xmath10 .",
    "the only way how ( [ pichargedcon ] ) could hold is @xmath896 .",
    "however , a simple computation gives @xmath897 .",
    "since the adm mass is @xmath898 , equality can only happen where there is only one black hole ( i.e. when the spacetime is the extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole ) .",
    "for any configuration with two or more black holes , ( [ pichargedcon ] ) is violated for the area of the event horizon .",
    "this argument is however , not a proof that ( [ pichargedcon ] ) fails to hold because the static initial data set ( i.e. the hypersurface orthogonal to the static killing vector ) in the papapetrou - majumdar spacetime does not contain any minimal surface .",
    "each connected component of the event horizon corresponds to an asymptotic cylinder .",
    "thus , some engineering is required to construct an electrovacuum initial data set with a minimal surface and which violates ( [ pichargedcon ] ) .",
    "the method followed in @xcite consists in an adaptation of the gluing technique developed in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it consists in taking two copies of a static initial data set of the papapetrou - majumdar spacetime with two black holes of equal mass @xmath899 , such that one of the copies has positive charges and the other one negatives charges . by modifying the geometry far enough along the cylindrical ends",
    ", the two copies can be glued together to construct an initial data set with two asymptotically euclidean ends and a minimal surface with two connected components .",
    "the final step is to conformally transform the data so that the curvature scalar vanishes . by taking @xmath172 small enough",
    ", the resulting manifold violates the inequality ( [ pichargedcon ] ) .",
    "as the authors stress , this is not a counterexample of ( [ pichargedsym ] ) , which is the inequality that follows from penrose s heuristic argument .    returning to the question of whether the charged riemannian penrose inequality provides a variational characterization of the electrovacuum static black holes ( see also @xcite for a related discussion ) , we notice that the inequality ( [ pichargedsym ] ) can be written in the following equivalent way @xmath900 the reissner - nordstrm black holes have event horizons ( or equivalently outermost minimal surfaces in their static initial data ) with satisfy @xmath901 ( see ( [ kn ] ) with @xmath902 ) , with equality only for the extreme reisner - nordstrm case ( @xmath903 ) .",
    "so , these metrics belong to case ( ii ) above and , in fact , saturate the corresponding inequality .",
    "similarly , the event horizon of the papapetrou - majumdar spacetime has area @xmath904 , with equality only if there is only one black hole ( i.e. the metric is extreme reissner - nordstrm again ) .",
    "so , this case belongs to case ( i ) and obviously the inequality is again saturated .",
    "moreover , the papapetrou - majumdar static initial data is the only asymptotically euclidean , electrovacuum initial data @xmath905 satisfying @xmath903 ( see theorem 1.2 in @xcite as well as the related previous work @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the formulation ( [ split2 ] ) would in fact provide a variational characterization of all static charged black holes provided the inequality can be proven in case ( ii ) with equality only for the reissner - nordstrm initial data .",
    "in the non time - symmetric case , gibbons conjectured @xcite the inequality ( [ pichargedcon ] ) for connected and outermost future ( or past ) marginally outer trapped surfaces @xmath9 . in the non - connected case , the corresponding conjecture involves the sum over each connected component of the right - hand side of ( [ pichargedcon ] ) .",
    "although no counterexample is explicitly known , such an inequality would reduce in vacuum to a stronger statement than the standard penrose inequality . as noted by weinstein and yamada @xcite",
    ", it seems that an initial data representing two schwarzschild black holes sufficiently far apart should violate this version of the inequality . in the particular case of spherical symmetry ( where @xmath9 is automatically connected ) ,",
    "gibbons conjecture has been proven by malec and  murchadha @xcite for maximal initial data sets and by hayward @xcite in the general case .    in the discussion above",
    "we have dropped the angular momentum term in ( [ kn ] ) and have retained the charge .",
    "it is natural to ask what is the situation in the reverse case , i.e. when the charge is dropped and the angular momentum in kept .",
    "the inequality that results is @xmath906 .",
    "however , contrarily to the electromagnetic case , the total angular momentum of the final end - state after the collapse has been completed need not coincide with the initial one since gravitational waves carry angular momentum and this can be radiated away . as first discussed in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , there is one important situation where angular momentum must be conserved along the evolution , namely in the axially symmetric case . under this restriction",
    ", the penrose heuristic argument implies @xcite,@xcite , @xmath907 similarly as before , this inequality only makes sense provided one can show that any asymptotically euclidean and axially symmetric initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition @xmath129 satisfies the inequality @xmath908 .",
    "again , this is a strengthening of the positive mass theorem .",
    "this inequality is supported by a heuristic argument based on cosmic censorship and the conservation of angular momentum in the axially symmetric case @xcite and its validity has been rigorously proven in @xcite for any initial data set @xmath153 which is vacuum , maximal ( @xmath909 ) , contains one or more asymptotically euclidean ends as well as possibly additional asymptotically cylindrical ends ( which correspond to degenerate horizons ) and such that the outermost mots is connected ( see also @xcite for an extension which admits furthermore non - negative energy - density and relaxes some of the technical requirements in @xcite ) . moreover , the case of equality @xmath910 occurs if and only if the initial data is a slice of the extreme kerr black hole .",
    "this provides a variational characterization of extreme kerr .",
    "the inequality in the case with an outermost mots with several connected components remains still open .",
    "numerical evidences for its validity have been recently given in @xcite .",
    "the situation for the penrose inequality with angular momentum is therefore similar to the charged case .",
    "the inequality ( [ piangularmomentum ] ) is equivalent to @xmath911 where @xmath912 .",
    "this version of the penrose conjecture ( for axially symmetric initial data sets ) admits a rigidity case which states that equality in case ( ii ) can only occur of the initial data is a slice of the kerr black hole .",
    "again , this would provide a variational characterization of the kerr metric .",
    "in this section we briefly mention some recent situations where the penrose inequality has been exploited to derive new results .",
    "the list is probably not exhaustive , but it gives a hint on the potential power of the penrose inequality as a geometric tool for adressing , a priori , completely unrelated problems .",
    "we have already mentioned in subsect .",
    "[ huiskenilmanen ] that the riemannian penrose inequality has interesting consequences for the quasi - local definition of mass due to bartnik .",
    "the riemannian penrose inequality has also allowed for a dual definition of quasi - local mass due to bray @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here , an asymptotically euclidean domain with non - negative curvature scalar and",
    "whose boundary @xmath9 is area outer minimizing is kept fixed , and all possible `` fill in ' 's ( with non - negative curvature scalar ) are considered .",
    "the _ inner mass _ is defined as the supremum of @xmath747 where @xmath9 is the minimal area needed to enclose all the asymptotically euclidean ends , except the given one . as a consequence of the riemannian penrose inequality",
    ", the inner mass is always bounded above by the adm mass of the given region .",
    "the definition can also be extended to the case of non - zero second fundamental form .",
    "we have also mentioned in section [ hyperbolicsect ] another application of the penrose inequality for the uniqueness problem of static black holes with negative cosmological constant and topology at infinity of genus larger than one .    the riemannian penrose inequality ( in fact , its proof using inverse mean curvature flow ) has been applied recently to obtain lower bounds of the so - called brown - york energy for simply connected , compact , three - dimensional domains @xmath433 with non - negative curvature scalar and with smooth boundary @xmath913 of positive gauss curvature and positive mean curvature @xmath42 ( with respect to the outer direction ) .",
    "the brown - york mass is defined as @xmath914 where @xmath915 is the mean curvature of @xmath913 when this surface is embedded isometrically in @xmath357 .",
    "this mass is proven to be non - negative in @xcite . using the inverse mean curvature flow , shi and tam",
    "prove @xcite ( among other things ) that the inequality @xmath916 holds with equality if only if @xmath161 is a standard ball in @xmath357 .",
    "still another application of the riemann penrose inequality is due to j. corvino @xcite , who has shown that asymptotically euclidean , 3-dimensional , riemannian manifolds with non - negative curvature scalar and small mass can not contain any minimal surface and must be diffeomorphic to @xmath357 .",
    "the required `` small mass '' condition reads @xmath917 , where @xmath229 is a positive upper bound for all the sectional curvatures of the manifold .",
    "the proof is based on the fact that any outermost minimal surface @xmath9 must satisfy @xmath918 as a consequence of the gauss - bonnet theorem . therefore , the penrose inequality implies that no minimal surface can exist in these circumstances .",
    "in this review i have discussed the present status of the penrose inequality .",
    "the emphasis has been put on trying to describe the techniques involved in the various approaches to prove it and trying to place the results into the right context so that a clear picture emerges of how impressive the body of work in this field has already been and what are the open problems that still remain .",
    "although i have tried to cover the main results in this field , some aspects have been touched upon in less detail .",
    "for instance , i have concentrated mostly on the four dimensional case , although several results in higher dimensions have been discussed at various places .",
    "some further results in higher dimensions can be found in the references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "numerical work has also been important for a better understanding of the penrose inequality .",
    "outermost marginally outer trapped surfaces ( i.e. the boundary of the outer trapped region @xmath264 ) are located routinely in numerical black hole evolutions in order to track the boundaries of the black holes .",
    "the numerical routines to do this job are collectively termed _ apparent horizon finders _ ( see @xcite for a review ) and obviously they can also be used to test the validity of the penrose conjecture .",
    "they have been used to check whether the penrose inequality is fulfilled in explicit numerical examples , as well as for looking for counterexamples to some of its versions .",
    "they can also serve as a test to make sure that the mots being located is , in fact , the outermost one @xcite . in this review",
    ", numerical results have been mentioned only very tangentially .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in a 3 + 1 evolution of a spacetime",
    "the outermost mots generates a tube of surfaces which is generally smooth but may jump from time to time @xcite . in the smooth part , this tube has been called marginally outer trapped tube @xcite .",
    "if the foliation is by marginally trapped surfaces ( instead of mots ) , the tube is usually called trapping horizon @xcite or dynamical horizon @xcite ( with slight differences in their definitions ) .",
    "a proper study of the evolution of these tubes , specially their late time behaviour , is potentially a powerful method for establishing the penrose inequality @xcite .",
    "this is because it is expected that , at late times , the tube approaches the event horizon of the spacetime .",
    "furthermore , if the mots foliating the tube are in fact marginally trapped surfaces , then their area increases with time @xcite . since this area is believed to approach that of the event horizon of the final black hole that forms ( and this is greater than the initial adm mass , as usual ) the penrose inequality would follow from a detailed understanding of the late time evolution of the spacetime and of the outermost marginally outer trapped tube .",
    "this approach however , is very different in spirit to the ones discussed above because understanding the late time behaviour of the tube goes a long way towards establishing weak cosmic censorship .",
    "thus , in essence , the penrose inequality would follow because cosmic censorship would hold .",
    "so , instead of looking at the penrose inequality as an indirect test of cosmic censorship , as originally envisaged by penrose , it would become a remarkable corollary of a much stronger theorem establishing weak cosmic censorship ( or something very close to it ) . in any case , studying the evolution of the outermost tube is an active area of research , which combines physical properties , numerical simulations and rigorous geometric results .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .    to conclude , as i have tried to show in this review , the penrose conjecture is a very challenging problem that requires techniques from geometric analysis , partial differential equations , riemannian and lorentzian geometry , as well as physical intuition .",
    "the recent advances in this field have been impressive and our understanding of the problem is now better than ever .",
    "nevertheless , many open problems remain and their study is likely to uncover new and unexpected features in the future .",
