    "the propagation of low energy neutrinos in the earth @xcite is an important aspect of physics of solar  @xcite - @xcite and supernova ( sn ) neutrinos  @xcite - @xcite",
    ". it will be useful in determining the oscillation parameters , and , in future , to search for effects of 1 - 3 mixing  @xcite and for a tomography of the earth ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "it might even be possible to look for small structures of the density profile  @xcite .    in the existing calculations of earth matter effects ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite - @xcite ) the density profile is often approximated by one , two or several layers ( mainly mantle and core ) with constant densities or a direct numerical integration of the evolution equation is performed .",
    "however , the emergence of the large mixing msw solution to the solar neutrino problem opens a more efficient approach to the oscillation effects in the earth . indeed , for the lma parameters , the oscillations of the solar and ( lower energy ) supernova neutrinos inside the earth occur in a weak regime , where the matter potential @xmath4 is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the neutrino system , _",
    "i.e. _ v(x ) .",
    "[ cond ] here @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the fermi constant , @xmath7 is the number density of the electrons , @xmath8 is the mass squared difference , and @xmath9 is the neutrino energy .    in this case",
    "one can introduce a small parameter ( x ) & & 2 e v(x ) m^2 [ eps ] + & = & 0.02 , where @xmath10 is the avogadro number , and consider an expansion of the oscillation probabilities in @xmath11 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath3 perturbation theory was formulated in the basis of neutrino mass states @xmath12 .",
    "the oscillation probabilities and the regeneration factor were calculated to first order in @xmath3 .",
    "the expressions obtained are valid for arbitrary density profiles with sufficiently low density ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "they simplify the numerical calculations substantially and allow to understand in details all features of the oscillation effects .",
    "the method reproduced immediately the analytic result obtained in  @xcite for an approximate but realistic density profile .",
    "similar integral expression for the regeneration factor has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath11 increases with energy , the lowest approximation in @xmath11 may not be enough for larger energies .",
    "for instance , if @xmath13 mev ( possible for sn neutrinos ) , we find @xmath14 at the center of the earth .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve on this method and obtain accurate formulas which are valid for higher energies . in section 2",
    "the oscillation probabilities are calculated in second order in @xmath11 and the convergence of the @xmath3 expansion is commented on . in section 3",
    "we suggest an improved perturbation theory which allows one to extend the expansion to higher energies .",
    "the generalization to three neutrinos is given in section 4 and a brief conclusion in section 5 .",
    "in this and the following section we consider the mixing of two ( active ) neutrinos @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath12 are the flavor and mass states , respectively and @xmath17 is a linear combination of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mixing matrix and mixing angle in vacuum .",
    "we define the matrix @xmath22 as @xmath23    in  @xcite the following expression for the @xmath24-matrix in the mass eigenstates basis was derived : , where @xmath25 is the diagonalized hamiltonian ( msw solution ) at point ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we would like to stress that only that separation of the hamiltonian into a non - perturbative ( @xmath25 ) and a perturbative ( @xmath26 ) parts leads to results where terms proportional to the full distance traveled by neutrinos in matter are absent ; this is in fact guaranteed by the existence of the msw solution . ]",

    "( [ subst ] ) we have subtracted a term proportional to the unit matrix in order to make it traceless and thus convenient for a power expansion .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to the transition probabilities of the mass eigenstates to @xmath31 : p__1 _ e & = & c_13 ^ 2 c_12 ^ 2 -^2 2 _ 12 2 c_13 ^ 4 _ x_0^x_f dx v _",

    "the function @xmath32 oscillates @xmath33 times faster than @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the corresponding integral is roughly @xmath35 times smaller than the one which contains the phase @xmath36 ; furthermore , it has a prefactor @xmath37 .",
    "therefore we get to a good approximation p__1 _ e & = & c_13 ^ 2 c_12 ^ 2 -^2 2 _ 12 2 c_13 ^ 4 _ x_0^x_f dx v _ x x_f , [ p1e ] + p__2 _",

( [ p1e ] ) -([p3e ] )",
    "motivated by the large mixing msw solution to the solar neutrino we have developed a simple formulation of the earth matter effects on low energy neutrino beams .",
    "following @xcite , we derive an expansion for the neutrino transitions in terms of the parameter @xmath43 to second order . by choosing a convenient constant average value for the neutrino potential as starting point",
