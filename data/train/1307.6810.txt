    "when a liquid jet impacts on a solid surface , it shatters violently , spreads out rapidly and deforms into an elegant thin film @xcite .",
    "such an impressive phenomenon has attracted both lay people and scientists . in 1833 , well before the invention of high - speed photography , the french physicist savart conducted a `` water - bell '' experiment and illustrated with precise hand - drawn pictures the dynamics of a water jet hitting a small disc @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous fluid impact process , occurring in many natural and industrial circumstances , is determined by momentum and energy transfer between the fluid and the solid surface , and depends on fluid properties such as inertia , surface tension and viscosity @xcite .",
    "the pattern of ejecta created by impact has been used to reveal some fluid - like properties in different materials .",
    "for example , it has been found that a jet of granular materials hitting a solid target can form a hollow cone or a thin sheet , with a shape quantitatively matching that of a liquid _ without _ surface tension @xcite . as another more esoteric example",
    ", the coherent ejecta patterns observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have been analyzed to indicate that the quark - gluon plasma generated from impact of relativistic ions is a nearly perfect ( zero - shear - viscosity ) liquid @xcite . in spite of 16 orders of magnitude difference in their energy scales ,",
    "the two examples share one common feature : they both illustrate emergent hydrodynamic flows out of strongly interacting discrete particles .",
    "thus , granular jet impact has been studied in part as a macroscopic analog of the rhic experiment @xcite or as a fluid with a finite viscosity @xcite . indeed ,",
    "similar to the anisotropic ejecta pattern of the quark - gluon plasma , an asymmetric granular sheet was produced in an experiment using a granular jet with a rectangular cross - section @xcite .",
    "a crucial feature of rhic experiment is that the degree of anisotropy in the ejecta pattern varies with the impact parameter between two ions : while a head - on collision with zero impact parameter results in symmetric ejecta , a glancing collision with impact parameter close to the diameter of an ion leads to a highly anisotropic elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "are the anisotropic ejecta patterns a universal feature of fluid impact ?",
    "can one mimic the variation of anisotropic ejecta in a classical fluid experiment ? to answer these questions , the experimental challenge is to create a fluid jet with a non - circular cross - section of tunable aspect ratio to simulate the collision zone of two partially overlapped relativistic ions @xcite .",
    "the experiment is difficult , if not impossible , to perform with normal liquids , where surface tension causes strong oscillations in the shape of a non - cylindrical jet and thus leads to uncontrollable collision areas .",
    "here , we employ a granular material as a special fluid with negligible surface tension @xcite .",
    "we perform a series of experiments using non - cylindrical granular jets with the aspect ratio of their cross - section ranging from 1 up to 6 .",
    "we uncover two distinct regimes of jet impact .",
    "moreover , we show that the anisotropy of ejected granular sheet increases with the jet aspect ratio .",
    "our results provide a new insight into the collective liquid - like behavior of granular materials and demonstrate a universal feature of the fluid - impact process . beyond its academic interest as an analog to rhic experiments , the results indicate a new way to manipulate the impact dynamics of granular jets , which have been widely used in industrial processes such as abrasive machining , sand - blast cleaning and polishing @xcite .",
    "our experimental setup is similar to that used in previous studies @xcite .",
    "it consists of a glass launching tube filled with a densely - packed granular material ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the tube has an inner diameter of @xmath0 mm , and is connected to a high - pressure gas tank through a valve .",
    "the gas accelerates a granular column of length @xmath1 cm to a speed @xmath2 m / s at the opening of the launching tube along the @xmath3 direction . during the impact ,",
    "the speed of the granular jet varies : the jet slows down initially due to the impact and then accelerates as the length of the granular column becomes shorter .",
    "however , as shown previously , the dynamics of granular jet impact is independent of the impact speed due to the nearly zero surface - tension of granular matter @xcite .",
    "the solid target has a diameter @xmath4 cm .",
    "we choose a large target such that the area of the target @xmath5 is 4.4 times larger than the cross - section of granular jets .",
    "the target is centered on the jet axis and is 1.4 cm away from a changeable slot ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . to modify the jet cross - section",
    ", a slot of prescribed shape and aspect ratio is inserted between the tube and the target . after passing through the slot ,",
    "the jet acquires a cross - section with a shape approximately the same as the slot . by inserting different slots",
    ", we can control the shape of the jet s cross - section .",
    "a small gap of about 5 mm is left between the slot and the tube to avoid jamming of the moving jet inside the tube . after passing the slot ,",
    "the impact speed of granular column decreases to @xmath6 m / s .",
    "a high - speed camera ( phantom v7 ) was used to image the impact dynamics at 2000 frames per second from behind the target . to improve imaging ,",
    "the slot is surrounded by a black screen so that only particles behind the slot could be viewed .",
    "furthermore , we constructed a transparent target and target holder for some experiments so that the ejected particles can be seen without obstruction .",
    "throughout our experiment , we use glass beads of diameters @xmath7 @xmath8 m as our granular material ( mo - sci corporation , class iv , sieve mesh size -140 + 200 ) . by tapping the launching tube ,",
    "the beads are compacted close to the random - close packing density before each run .",
    "direction into the plane of the paper .",
    "the spherical ions are subjected to lorentz contraction in the @xmath3 direction and become disks in the laboratory frame ( see section iii c ) . @xmath9 and @xmath10 define the semi - axis of the collision zone .",

    "( c ) slots of different aspect ratios .",
    "the dimension of each slot is given in table  [ tab : table1].,width=249 ]    since one of our goals is to mimic the collision zone of the rhic experiments , the choice of the jets cross - section shape is crucial .",
    "the azimuthal ( @xmath14 ) projection of the collision zone between two spherical ions consists of two circular segments with an almond - like shape ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]a ) @xcite .",
    "the aspect ratio of the zone , @xmath13 , depends on the impact parameter , @xmath11 , and the size of the ions .",
    "accordingly , we use a series of slots to produce granular jets with cross - sections similar to the collision zone of rhic experiments . to manufacture slots of different aspect ratios ,",
    "we adopt the following machining protocol .",
    "first , holes of different sizes are drilled along a straight line , @xmath15 , on two identical 6.0 mm thick polycarbonate plates ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) , where the radius of the @xmath16-th hole , @xmath17 , and its center location along @xmath15 , @xmath18 , are determined by : @xmath19 and @xmath20 here , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the desired area of the slot , and @xmath23 is an arbitrary angle that one chooses to cut the plates in the next step . specifically , we drill six holes on each plate with @xmath24 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 respectively and choose @xmath25 .",
    "next , we cut the first plate along line @xmath26 and cut the second plate along line @xmath27 .",
    "each of these two lines forms an angle @xmath23 with respect to the central line @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]b ) . joining the part @xmath28 with the part @xmath29 from these two cuts ,",
    "we obtain six slots depicted as the gray areas in fig .",
    "[ figure2]b .",
    "the final slots are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2]c and the dimension of the slots are indicated in table  [ tab : table1 ] . using these slots",
    ", we can generate granular jets with cross - sections similar to the collision zones of relativistic heavy ions at different impact parameters .",
    "a further discussion of the analogy between our experiments and rhic experiments can be found in section iii c.    .[tab : table1 ] dimension of the almond - shaped slots used in the experiments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to ensure that the granular jets passing through a slot are not perturbed too much in their motions and acquire a cross - section with the same shape as the slot , we performed two experiments .",
    "first , we removed the target and observed the jets moving directly toward the camera . after passing through the slot",
    ", the particles still move along the axis of the launching tube with only a slight downward bending due to the gravity .",
    "therefore , the slots do not induce significant particle motion normal to the axis of the jets .",
    "although the axial velocity of the particles may be modified after particles pass through the slot , the impact dynamics are not affected by the magnitude of impact speed @xcite .",
    "we performed another experiment to quantitatively measure the shape of the cross - section of a granular jet by detecting particle motion immediately in front of a transparent target . from this measurement , we confirm that the jet cross - section is quantitatively similar to the shape of the inserted slot ( see section iii b ) .",

    "throughout our experiments , we maintain the area of the target 4.4 times larger than the cross - section of jets .",
    "hence , the ejected granular sheet is always perpendicular to the incoming jet .",
    "this is consistent with a previous study , where granular cones with apex angle @xmath35 sets in only when @xmath36 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the shape of the ejected granular sheet in the @xmath14 plane",
    ".      the dynamics of granular - jet impact shows two distinct regimes .",
    "we illustrate these regimes with a small jet of @xmath37 mm@xmath30 , @xmath31 and a large jet of @xmath38 mm@xmath30 , @xmath39 .",
    "when the jet first impacts the target , the energy of the spreading ejecta is highly focused .",
    "the jet deforms into one or two thick streams , which emerge along the short axis ( the @xmath40 axis ) of the jet s cross - section ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]a , c ) . for jets with a small cross - section ,",
    "the streams are weak and asymmetric ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]a and supplementary movie 1 @xcite ) . for jets with a larger cross - section , two strongly focused streams",
    "are observed , which emerge in opposite directions along @xmath40 ( fig .",

    "[ figure3]c , d. from a side - view of the impact , one can identify a downward moving stream symmetric to the upward shooting one shown in fig .",

    "this first regime of granular impact is a transient state . as shown recently , during impact particles",
    "pile up in front of the target into a `` dead zone '' , where particle mobility goes to zero @xcite .",
    "the ejection of streams in this regime may be related to the formation of this `` dead zone '' during initial impact . for a jet with smaller cross - section ( @xmath37 mm@xmath30 )",
    ", this transit regime is shorter and less pronounced ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]a and supplemental movie 1 @xcite ) .    in the second regime , after the emergence of the thin streams , an asymmetric granular sheet emerges ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]b and d ) .",
    "the major axis of the sheet is along the short axis of the impacting jet s cross - section .",
    "the anisotropy of the sheet implies that particles that escape along the short axis of the collision zone have larger momentum .    in this second regime ,",
    "the granular jet reaches a steady state .",
    "the ejecta is less focused , and the pattern persists over a longer time . increasing @xmath41 , the length of jet , increases the duration . both the anisotropic shape and its relative orientation in fig .",

    ", we first neglect the energy loss due to the inelasticity of particle collision and assume the particles are spheres .",
    "after impact , the reflected particles move in the @xmath47 direction , collide with other incoming particles in the jet , acquire a velocity component in the azimuthal direction normal to the @xmath3 axis , and eventually escape the impact zone .",
    "the frequency and duration of particle collisions depend on the concentration of particles in the jet .",
    "for very concentrated granular jets , persistent contact between particles may occur .",
    "structures such as `` dead zones '' emerge during impact , which can be understood in terms of incompressible granular fluids @xcite .",
    "accordingly , two limiting cases should be considered :    \\(1 ) in the ideal gas limit , the particles in the jet are dilute so that the chance of a particle colliding a second time with another particle is rare ( supplementary movie 3 @xcite ) .",
    "most reflected particles collide only once and then move ballistically out of the impact zone . since the relative position between a reflected particle and an incoming one is random ,",
    "the collision - induced azimuthal velocity component is uniformly distributed . in other words ,",
    "the scattering cross - section is independent of @xmath45 .",
    "a geometric argument shows that the distribution of particles in the polar angle direction is proportional to @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "since the impact process only involves uncorrelated two - particle collisions , it does not depend on the shape of collision zone ; a symmetric ejecta will form regardless of the shape of the cross - section of the jet .",
    "adding inelasticity and non - spherical shapes of realistic granular particles to the problem does not affect the above conclusion .",
    "symmetric ejecta in low - density jets were shown in previous work @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) as the particle density increases , a particle experiences many more collisions . the mean free path becomes smaller than the particle size when the concentration is high @xcite . in this limit",
    ", a large number of collisions creates a highly - interacting region @xcite so that a hydrodynamic pressure builds up in the center of the impact zone .",
    "the pressure gradient is largest along the @xmath40 axis , where the distance between the center and the boundary is shortest .",
    "this pressure gradient induces the highest particle momentum along the short axis and leads to the observed anisotropic ejecta .",
    "the inelastic nature of the collisions may also lead to particle clusters in an isolated system @xcite .",
    "such a cluster instability is not observed in our experiment , where the system has an open boundary with a rapid energy influx .",
    "we directly probe the formation of the anisotropic ejecta in the second steady - state regime by investigating the detailed particle dynamics behind a transparent target ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] and supplementary movie 4 @xcite ) .",
    "the zoom - in video allows us to track the motion of particles using particle imaging velocimetry ( piv ) .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] shows the steady - state velocity field for a granular jet passing through a slot of @xmath42 .",
    "as expected , the constant velocity contours have an almond - like shape quantitatively similar to the shape of the slot ( fig .",
    "[ figure4]b ) .",
    "the aspect ratio of the constant velocity profiles is @xmath49 near the impact point , which is very close to the aspect ratio of the slot , @xmath42 .",
    "the radial velocity of particles varies slightly in the steady state ( fig .",
    "[ figure4]c ) .",
    "particle velocity at @xmath50 mm away from the center of the impact zone decreases first upon impact and increases toward the end of the steady state .",
    "the overall change is about @xmath51 .",
    "[ figure4]d shows the radial velocity distribution of particles at different radial distances from the impact - zone center .",
    "note that the velocity is largest along the short axis of the slot , consistent with the large - scale measurement shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3]b .",
    "more important , the measurement shows that the motion of particles quickly converge to a saturated anisotropic distribution within 4 ms after impact .",
    "the velocity approaches a steady profile between 5 @xmath52 6 mm ( 50 to 60 particles diameters ) from the center of the impact zone ( fig .",
    "[ figure4]d ) .",
    "this central region where particle velocities increases from almost zero to 3 m / s is an almond - shaped `` dead zone '' , similar to the symmetric `` dead zone '' found in the impact of cylindrical granular jets @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric ejecta pattern has been used as critical evidence for the liquid - like behavior of the quark - gluon plasma in the rhic experiments @xcite .",
    "the analogy between those experiments and the granular - jet experiments can be seen from the geometry of the impact process .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the target in our experiment acts as a mirror to reflect particle momentum .",
    "hence , the shape of the collision zone where the reflected particles collide with the incoming particles is the same as the cross - section of the granular jet . in the rhic experiments , due to relativistic effects , spherical ions become disks of thickness of @xmath53 in the lab frame , where @xmath54 is the radius of heavy ions in the rest frame , @xmath55 is the lorentz factor , @xmath56 is the velocity of the impacting ions and @xmath57 is the speed of light in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the disk @xmath53 plays the role of the length of the granular jets in our experiments . the collision zone  the partially overlapped area of two disks  has the same shape as in granular jet experiments ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]a ) . in a rhic collision , there exists a time delay between the impact and the formation of ejecta @xcite .",
    "hence , the parts of heavy ions outside the overlapped area , which pass by the collision zone after the impact with a speed near the speed of light , do not affect the formation of ejecta .",
    "clearly , the nature of interactions in the rhic and in the granular - jet experiments are completely different .",
    "however , the fact that the rhic results can be successfully interpreted by a coarse - grained , long - wavelength hydrodynamic theory indicates that the impact dynamics are largely independent of detailed interactions @xcite .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that our experiments show similar ejecta patterns as the rhic experiments",

    "such features indicate different groups of particles that impact on the target at different times and can be employed to track the dynamics of the ejecta ( fig .",
    "[ figure5]a and supplementary movie 1 @xcite ) . as the most obvious example",
    ", the trailing edge of the ejecta sheet arises from the impact of the last group of particles on the target ( fig .  [",

    "different rings have different radial velocities  a ring created at later times tends to have larger radial velocities due to the increasing pressure gradient across the jet and hence it will sweep out all the rings in front of it during its outward motion ( supplementary movie 1 and 2 @xcite ) .",
    "however , at a fixed time , rings at different radial locations can be collapsed onto a master curve if scaled by the characteristic size of the rings ( fig .",
    "[ figure5]c , d ) .",
    "hence , any of these concentric rings can be used for studying the shape of ejecta when a proper normalization is implemented . practically , it is more convenient to choose the trailing edge of the ejecta ( fig .",
    "[ figure5]b ) , since it has the maximum velocity and the sharpest contrast to the background throughout the impact process ( supplementary movie 1 @xcite ) .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath58 at a given time @xmath61 can be understood as follows .",
    "after the velocity of particles converges to a steady profile which happens within a small region surrounding the `` dead zone '' ( fig .  [ figure4 ] ) , particles in the ejecta simply move ballistically outward from the center of the impact zone . therefore , at large distances , the radial location of a ring , @xmath58 , is related to the radial particle velocity @xmath65 simply by @xmath66 .",

    "the dynamics of the momentum distribution @xmath59 can thus be obtained from impact movies ( fig .",

    "we have illustrated the liquid - like behavior of granular materials by preforming granular - impact experiments with non - cylindrical jets .",
    "using high - speed photography , we found much richer dynamics than previously reported @xcite .",
    "the collective hydrodynamics of granular jets is vividly demonstrated by the anisotropic shape of ejected sheets .",
    "inspired by the rhic experiments , we showed that the degree of anisotropy can be controlled by using jets of different aspect ratio .",
    "the simple ballistic motion of particles can be used to interpret the evolution of ejecta in the large - time limit .",

    "our experimental findings pose new questions for future studies .",
    "how do granular particles equilibrate into a liquid state through collisions ? does the equipartition theorem apply in the granular impact process ? do different degrees of freedom , such as the translational and rotational motions of particles , have the same relaxation time ? what is the relation between the initial transient state of granular impact and granular - shock dynamics in loosely compacted granular media @xcite ?",
