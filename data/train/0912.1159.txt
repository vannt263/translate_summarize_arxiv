    "quantum information is delicate .",
    "the state of a qubit can be corrupted by environmental noise , dissipation , or by imperfectly implemented logic operations on the qubit . amongst",
    "the most remarkable achievements of quantum information science are the discoveries of quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite and fault tolerant quantum computation ( ftqc ) @xcite , which demonstrate that storage and manipulation of quantum information is possible , even in the presence of such imperfections .",
    "typically , this protection is achieved by redundantly encoding the logical qubits in a larger number of physical qubits .",
    "a physical error may be classified as a _ computational _ error ,",
    "in which the state of the qubits remains within the computational basis , or as a _ loss _ ,",
    "in which a physical qubit ( e.g. a photon ) is lost from the computer .",
    "more generally , any detectable leakage process taking the qubit out of the computational basis can be treated as a loss error .",
    "importantly , losses are presumed to be detectable , and in many qubit implementations , losses are a significant source of noise .    previous work by dawson et al .",
    "@xcite established thresholds against simultaneous loss and computational errors , finding that ftqc is possible provided @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "various studies , considering each error process in isolation , have derived much higher thresholds for each : varnava et al .",
    "@xcite constructed an encoding with a loss tolerance threshold of 50@xmath2 , whilst knill @xcite and raussendorf et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated computational error thresholds at the 1@xmath2 level for ftqc . in recent work considering the restricted problem of storing quantum information in _ surface codes _ @xcite , we showed that these thresholds can be achieved in the presence of simultaneous losses and computational errors @xcite .",
    "the properties of surface code stabilisers that enable this synthesis of the known loss and computational error thresholds for quantum memories are shared by the more elaborate schemes developed by raussendorf et al .",
    "@xcite that are capable of full ftqc .",
    "we therefore fully expect that the methods we describe here will apply directly to ftqc schemes , including losses .    in parallel ,",
    "a fruitful line of research has established the intriguing connection between classical error correction and statistical mechanics models @xcite .",
    "more recently , similar connections between quantum error correction and phase transitions in many body systems have been made .",
    "notably , dennis et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that optimally decoding an error syndrome on a surface code was equivalent to solving the classical 2-dimensional random - bond ising model ( rbim ) .",
    "this observation implies that the error correction threshold coincides with the nishimori point of the rbim , i.e. that the error correction threshold is @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "further , numerical studies attempted to not only implement computationally efficient error correction algorithms , based on edmonds minimum weight matching algorithm , but to simultaneously make predictions about the phase diagram of the rbim . on the basis of large monte carlo simulations , wang et al .",
    "@xcite established very precise predictions about the location of the zero temperature phase transition in the rbim , namely that @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we expand on the discussion in @xcite of a number of subtleties in the implementation of our loss tolerant protocol . we provide a more detailed derivation of the edge weights that were introduced in @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the ` phase - diagram ' in the parameter space of losses and computational errors giving more detailed results of our numerical monte carlo simulations , as well as a new analytic result for slope of the phase boundary at small values of the loss rate .",
    "we also give an exposition of the interactions between error chains and percolated clusters of loss on finite lattices leading to a deviation from universal scaling as the loss rate approaches the percolation threshold .",
    "secondly , we discuss the role of degeneracy in matching algorithms for error correction and for the rbim . in the context of error correction , there are in fact very many matchings that attain the minimum weight , and so in this sense the code is highly degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy was recently discussed in @xcite , and was implicit in the edge weighting introduced in @xcite .",
    "we derive expressions for the matching probability , accounting for path degeneracy .",
    "we show that the degeneracy behaves analogously to an entropy term in a quasi - free energy . on a square lattice",
    ", we provide a combinatorial expression for the shortest - path degeneracy of a given matching , and we exploit this to improve the error correction threshold for the surface code modestly , from @xmath5 @xcite to above @xmath6 . in the context of the rbim ,",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself in the very large degeneracy of the ground state manifold .",
    "the degeneracy becomes important when computing numerical estimates of the locations of phase transitions in this , and related models .",
    "in particular , we show that it is important to fairly sample from the ground state manifold in order to make accurate quantitative predictions of phase transition thresholds .",
    "we also give some evidence to suggest that existing implementations of matching algorithms do not do this , so may possibly suffer a systematic inaccuracy .",
    "for the purposes of analysis , the error model we consider is local and uncorrelated .",
    "each physical qubit is lost with probability @xmath7 .",
    "losses are presumed to be detectable : a projector onto the computational basis of a given qubit , @xmath8 , is an observable indicating whether the state of the qubit has leaked out of the computational basis , without affecting the computational state of the qubit if it has not .",
    "the remaining qubits are subject to independent bit - flip ( x ) and phase ( z ) errors , each with probability @xmath9 .",
    "both errors are handled in an analogous way in the surface code , so here we confine our attention to x errors , noting that the thresholds for z errors will be identical . aside from these errors ,",
    "we assume other quantum operations ( e.g. encoding operations , decoding operations , and syndrome measurements ) can be implemented perfectly .",

    "kitaev s surface codes are defined by a set of stabilisers @xcite acting on a set of physical qubits that reside on the edges of a square lattice .",
    "the stabiliser group is generated by plaquette operators , which are products of @xmath12 operators acting on qubits within a plaquette , @xmath15 , and star operators , which are products of @xmath10 operators acting on qubits within a star , @xmath16 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ toriccode ] @xcite .",
    "star and plaquette operators all mutually commute , and the code space @xmath17 is a simultaneous @xmath18 eigenstate of all star and plaquette operators .",
    "if the @xmath19 lattice has periodic boundary conditions ( a torus ) , there are @xmath20 physical qubits , @xmath21 independent plaquette operators and @xmath21 independent star operators .",
    "there are therefore two unspecified degrees of freedom , so the code is capable of encoding two logical qubits , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "a logical @xmath24 operator corresponds to a product of @xmath12 operators along a homologically nontrivial cycle extending across the entire lattice , shown in fig .",

    "note that we can obtain a new logical operator by multiplying the original one by a plaquette stabiliser , @xmath26 .",
    "the actions of @xmath24 and @xmath27 on the code space are the same , since .",
    "thus there are many homologically equivalent cycles spanning the lattice with which to measure each logical qubit operator , as shown in fig .",
    "[ toriccode](b ) .",
    "this redundancy allows us to obtain the loss threshold for the case @xmath28 : if only a few physical qubits are lost , it is likely that each logical operator can still be measured by finding a homologically nontrival cycle which avoids all lost physical qubits .",
    "thus the encoded quantum information can be reliably recovered .",
    "if @xmath7 is too high , there is likely to be a _ percolated _ region of losses that spans the entire lattice , in which case there are no homologically nontrivial cycles with which to measure the logical operators . in the limit of large @xmath29 ,",
    "the boundary between recoverable and non - recoverable errors is a sharp transition corresponding to the _ bond percolation threshold _ on the 2d square lattice @xcite : for @xmath30 error recovery can almost surely be achieved , whereas for @xmath31 error recovery almost surely fails .",

    "we first describe how losses can be corrected by forming new stabiliser generators , which are aggregations of plaquettes or stars , called superplaquettes and superstars , respectively .",
    "the superstar and superplaquette eigenvalues then reveal the error syndromes , and a perfect matching algorithm is used to find an error correction chain @xmath37 .",

    "an error chain ending within the superplaquette @xmath53 changes the eigenvalue of @xmath52 to @xmath36 .",

    "the fact that superplaquette operators yield syndrome information with which to construct an error correction chain , @xmath37 , is the basis for our loss - tolerant error - correction scheme .",
    "in general , given any set of lost qubits , we can form a complete set of stabilisers on the damaged lattice in the following way : for each lost qubit @xmath54 , which participates in neighbouring ( super)plaquettes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we form the superplaquette operator @xmath57 , which is independent of @xmath58 . in the same way",

    "likewise , there is a damaged star operator @xmath64 with indeterminate eigenvalue that also commutes with the new stabilisers on the damaged lattice . having indeterminate eigenvalues , these mutually - anticommuting , damaged operators form a two - dimensional degree of freedom in an unspecified state .",

    "since @xmath66 and @xmath67 each commute with the new stabilisers , and with the deformed logical operators , the junk qubit is therefore in a product state with the logical qubits : @xmath68 , and so the loss does not affect the logical qubits .    when analysing the pattern of syndromes on the plaquettes and superplaquettes , we construct a new graph , depicted in fig .",

    "( [ tau ] ) carries a small weight , so that @xmath213 is maximised with matchings in the ground state manifold : the matching algorithm chooses a maximally degenerate matching _ within that manifold_. this is demonstrated fig .",
    "[ gsfrac ] , where the fraction of matchings that are also minimum distance matchings is shown for different values of @xmath216 . for @xmath230 ,",
    "this fraction is essentially unity , so that all matchings are also minimum distance matchings .    the threshold increases with increasing @xmath216 , and peaks around @xmath231 or so .",
    "interestingly , this is somewhat better than the threshold at @xmath232 , pertaining to eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "when @xmath233 , the matching algorithm no longer simply maximises the matching path probability , @xmath205 . instead , it favours more degenerate paths .",
    "finally , the threshold decreases as @xmath216 increases further .",
    "this behaviour is qualitatively consistent with the proposed re - entrant phase diagram for the rbim , shown in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there is a notable discrepancy between the thresholds and minimum distance matching fractions on even and odd lattices . for @xmath234",
    "even lattices appear to have a substantially higher threshold than do odd lattices .",
    "this discrepancy is much larger than that discussed in @xcite , shown for @xmath222 .",
    "the deviation of the minimum weight matching fraction from unity also follows different trends depending on the parity of the lattice : on odd lattices it begins deviating from unity for @xmath235 , whilst on even lattices the deviation sets in at @xmath233 ( see fig .  [ gsfrac ] ) .",
    "because the system is discrete , there is necessarily a gap between the ground state manifold and the low lying excited states of the rbim . in particular , fig .",
    "[ gsfrac ] , suggests that this gap is smaller on odd lattices than on even lattices , so that at a given ` temperature ' @xmath216 there a higher chance of that an odd lattice will be in an excited state .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy remains an open problem .    .",
    "as @xmath216 increases , an increasing proportion of the selected matchings are longer than the minimum distance matchings ( i.e. ground state matchings ) , but have sufficiently high degeneracy that their free energy is lower .",
    "all simulations shown were done at @xmath236 , on different sized lattices , as indicated .",
    "note the disparity between the minimum distance matching fraction on even ( blue ) and odd ( red ) lattices . ]",
    "given the maximum possible threshold is set by the nishimorit point at @xmath237 @xcite , the addition of degeneracy in the matching algorithm improves the threshold by a modest but statistically significant margin .",
    "the most precise estimate for @xmath140 , the @xmath238 phase transition in the rbim , is currently the value reported in @xcite , and this result has been applied in the study of the classical 2d rbim .",
    "the observation of the huge degeneracy in the ground state manifold of the rbim raises the question of how to ensure that the ground states ( i.e.  minimum - distance matchings ) selected by edmonds algorithm are sampled _ fairly _ from the manifold .    as an elementary test ,",
    "we applied two freely available implementations , _ blossom iv _ @xcite and _ blossom v _",
    "@xcite , to the simple matching problem depicted in fig .",
    "[ parallelogram ] , permuting vertex labels through all 24 permutations to reorder the presentation of the complete graph .",
    "regardless of presentation , _ blossom iv",
    "_ always returned the least degenerate matching , @xmath184 , regardless of reordering . on the other hand , depending on the vertex labels , _",
    "blossom v _ returned both possible matchings : half of the permutations resulted in matching @xmath184 , and the other half yielded the alternative , @xmath185 .",
    "this test serves to demonstrate that different implementations of edmonds matching sample amongst the ground states differently .    to compute @xmath140 accurately ,",
    "we need to sample the ground states of the rbim fairly , i.e.  with a probability distribution proportional to the path matching degeneracy . to see this",
    ", we define an observable @xmath239 for the classical rbim to be the indicator function determining whether @xmath122 is in the trivial homology class : @xmath240 as in @xcite , @xmath140 is calculated from the scaling behaviour of @xmath241 , which is given by : @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the matching path degeneracy of the matching @xmath244 , @xmath245 is the ground state ( g.s . )",
    "degeneracy of the rbim instance @xmath34 , the grain boundary @xmath37 is interchangeable with a given ising spin configuration @xmath246 ( as described above , and in @xcite ) , and @xmath247 also we have used the fact that @xmath248 is constant over all minimum weight matching paths @xmath37 consistent with a given matching @xmath244 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath41 , the sum over @xmath34 is made unnecessary by appealing to an ergodic argument : @xmath249 , for any @xmath34 whose errors are uniformly distributed .    the final result , eq .  ( [ matchingdegen ] ) , establishes the distribution from which we should sample the matchings : @xmath250 .",
    "this result suggests that the direct use of existing implementations of edmonds perfect matching may not give accurate estimates of @xmath140 .    in principle , for a finite lattice , one could enumerate _ all _ matchings , compute the matching - path degeneracy for each , then evaluate eq .",
    "( [ matchingdegen ] ) explicitly , however this is computationally inefficient .",
    "we do not know of a computationally efficient way to ensure a fair sampling .",
    "we note however , that within the ground state manifold ( i.e.  taking @xmath251 ) , the error correction threshold is bounded by about 0.105 ( see fig .",
    "[ temp ] ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath252 . that this is statistically less than the nishimori probability @xmath226 gives support to the notion that the phase diagram is indeed reentrant , as has been discussed elsewhere .",
    "however we propose that an accurate value of @xmath140 may be higher than that reported in @xcite .",
    "we have shown using both numerical studies and analytic results that the simultaneous expression of both loss and computational errors can be dealt with in the context of topological memories .",
    "the trade - off between these processes is rather gentle . at low loss rates ,",
    "our analytical results indicate that , because superplaquettes embody more physical qubits , the principle effect of losses is a moderate , linear increase in the effective error rate per plaquette . at higher loss rates , changes in the structure and connectivity of the superplaquete lattice",
    "become significant .",
    "we have also shown that the classical algorithms used to implement topological quantum error correction can be improved by accounting for degeneracy in matching algorithms .",
    "this can take various forms ; either in modifying edge weights between neighbouring superplaquettes on an irregular lattice as discussed in @xcite , or by counting the number of degenerate shortest - paths between syndromes , as discussed here and in @xcite .",
    "both approaches may be implemented with little overhead to existing matching routines .",
    "this work also highlights the attention that needs to be given to degeneracy when calculating thresholds in the rbim and any related classical statistical mechanics simulations relying on implementations of edmonds matching algorithm . to accurately predict @xmath140",
