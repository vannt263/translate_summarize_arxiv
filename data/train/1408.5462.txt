    "a hierarchical triple system consists of a binary system and a third body on a wider orbit .",
    "the motion of such a system can be pictured as the motion of two binaries : the binary itself ( inner binary ) and the binary which consists of the third body and the centre of mass of the binary ( outer binary ) .",
    "hierarchical triple systems are widely present in the galactic field and in star clusters and studying the dynamical evolution of such systems is a key to understanding a number of issues in astronomy and astrophysics . sometimes , for example , the inner pairs in triple stellar systems are _ close _ binary systems , i.e. the separation between the components is comparable to the radii of the bodies . in these circumstances ,",
    "the behaviour of the inner binary can depend very sensitively on the separation of its components and this in turn is affected by the third body .",
    "thus , a slight change in the separation of the binary stars can cause drastic changes in processes such as tidal friction and dissipation , mass transfer and mass loss due to a stellar wind , which may result in changes in stellar structure and evolution . eventually , these physical changes can affect the dynamics of the whole triple system .",
    "but even in systems with well - separated inner binary components , the perturbation of the third body can have a devastating effect on the triple system as a whole ( e.g. disruption of the system ) .    for most hierarchical triple stars ,",
    "the period ratio @xmath0 is of the order of 100 and these systems are probably very stable dynamically .",
    "however , there are systems with much smaller period ratios , like the system hd 109648 with @xmath1 ( jha et al .",
    "2000 ) , the @xmath2 tau system , with @xmath3 ( fekel @xmath4 tomkin 1982 ) and the ch cyg system with @xmath5 ( hinkle et al . 1993 ) .",
    "our aim is to find how much inner binary eccentricity is generated in systems with large period ratio @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we consider the case where the inner eccentricity is initially zero , since in close binaries tidal friction is expected to circularise the orbit .",
    "the outer orbit is also circular .",
    "the initial motivation to the work presented in this paper was given by the work of peter eggleton and his collaborators on stellar and dynamical evolution of triple systems ( eggleton @xmath4 kiseleva 1996 , kiseleva , eggleton @xmath4 mikkola 1998 ) .",
    "other recent work on the dynamics of hierarchical triple system includes the work done by ford , kozinsky @xmath4 rasio ( 2000 ) and krymolowski @xmath4 mazeh ( 1999 ) .",
    "we are going to derive expressions for the short period ( which varies on a time - scale comparable to the inner and outer orbital periods ) and secular modulations of the inner eccentricity .",
    "the short period terms will be obtained in a rather simple way , by using the definition of the runge - lenz vector , while the secular evolution , where it is needed , will be studied by means of canonical perturbation theory .",
    "it is also possible to obtain the short period terms by using canonical methods .",
    "however , as seen in the following section , using the definition of the eccentric vector is a quite straightforward procedure which does not require any knowledge of canonical perturbation theory .",
    "an important aspect of the theory that is developed in the subsequent sections is the combination of the short period and secular terms in the expressions for the eccentricities . at any moment of the evolution of the system",
    ", we will consider that the eccentricity ( inner or outer ) consists of a short period and a long period ( secular ) component , i.e. @xmath7 ( one can picture this by recalling the expansion of the disturbing function in solar system dynamics , where the perturbing potential is given as a sum of an infinite number of cosines of various frequencies ) . thus",
    ", considering the eccentricity to be initially zero leads to @xmath8 ( initially ) , which implies that , although the eccentricity is initially zero , the short and secular eccentricity may not be .",
    "finally , in this paper , as was stated earlier , we will be concentrating on systems with well separated components and comparable masses .",
    "therefore , while developing the theoretical model in the next sections , we will consider @xmath0 to be large ( or any equivalent form of that assumption ) .",
    "first , we calculate the short - period terms .",
    "the motion of the system can be studied using the jacobi decomposition of the three - body problem ( fig .",
    "[ jacform ] ) . in that context , the equation of motion of the inner binary is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the perturbation to the inner binary motion , is @xmath11 with @xmath12     is the centre of mass of the inner binary.,width=264,height=188 ]    now , since the third star is at considerable distance from the inner binary , implying that @xmath13 is small , the inverse distances in equation ( [ potenc1 ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the legendre polynomials and @xmath17 is the angle between the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 . expanding to third order , the perturbation becomes    @xmath20",
    "@xmath21    the first two terms in the above equation come from the quadrupole term ( @xmath22 ) , while the other two come from the octupole term ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "using now the definition of the eccentric vector , i.e. the vector which has the same direction as the radius vector to the pericentre and whose magnitude is equal to the eccentricity of the orbit , we can obtain an expression for the inner eccentricity .",
    "the inner eccentric vector @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 differentiating equation ( [ ecve ] ) and substituting for @xmath10 ( we neglect the term @xmath28 because , for the applications discussed in this paper , is expected to be small and of @xmath29 ) , we obtain : @xmath30.\\label{roo5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the jacobi vectors can be represented approximately in polar form as @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( again , the terms neglected are of @xmath29 ) , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the semi - major axes of the inner and outer orbit respectively and @xmath35 is the initial relative phase of the two binaries . after integrating , the components @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the eccentric vector become ( expanding in powers of @xmath38 and retaining the two leading terms ) : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 is the total mass of the system and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are constants of integration . the semi - major axes and mean motions were treated as constants in the above calculation .",
    "in order to derive the long - term modulation of the system , we use a hamiltonian which is averaged over the inner and outer orbital periods by means of the von zeipel method .",
    "secular terms can not be obtained by the method of section [ s1 ] , because , for an eccentric outer binary , those terms appear as a linear function of time in the expansion of the eccentric vector and therefore , they are valid for limited time .",
    "the doubly averaged hamiltonian for coplanar orbits is ( marchal 1990 , krymolowski @xmath4 mazeh 1999 ) :    @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the subscripts s and t refer to the inner and outer long period orbits respectively , while @xmath47 is used to denote longitude of pericentre .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian is the keplerian energy of the inner binary , the second term is the keplerian energy of the outer binary , while the other three terms represent the interaction between the two binaries .",
    "the @xmath48 term comes from the @xmath22 legendre polynomial , the @xmath49 term comes from the @xmath23 legendre polynomial and the @xmath50 term arises from the canonical transformation .",
    "it should be mentioned here that in marchal , @xmath50 includes only the term which is independent of the arguments of pericentre and the @xmath23 term in krymolowski and mazeh has the wrong sign .",
    "the same sign error appears in ford , kozinsky and rasio .    by using hamilton s equations",
    ", we can now derive the averaged equations of motion of the system .",

    "the solution to system ( [ dior ] ) is : @xmath70 where @xmath71 are constants of integration and @xmath72 is the initial value of @xmath73 .",
    "the only thing that remains now is to get an estimate for the initial @xmath61 ( since we saw earlier that @xmath74 remains almost constant , i.e. the outer eccentricity does not demonstrate any significant long term evolution ) and in order to do that , as was seen in section ( [ theo ] ) , we need to find an expression for the short period outer eccentricity .",
    "this can be achieved by following the same procedure as we did in section [ s1 ] , but this time we do it for the outer orbit .",
    "the equation of motion of the outer binary is @xmath75 and eventually , we obtain , to leading order , for the components of the outer short - period eccentric vector : @xmath76 suppose now that the outer secular eccentric vector is @xmath77 .",
    "then , the constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 in equations ( [ e21 ] ) and ( [ e22 ] ) can be replaced by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , since the latter vary slowly compared to @xmath82 and @xmath83 . considering that the outer binary is initially circular , i.e. @xmath84 , we obtain : @xmath85 and @xmath86      in paragraphs [ s1 ] and [ s2 ] we derived expressions for the short period and secular contribution to the inner eccentric vector . these can be combined to give an expression for the total eccentricity in the same way we got an estimate for the outer secular eccentricity , i.e. by replacing the constants in equations ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) by equations ( [ secsol1 ] ) and ( [ secsol2 ] ) , since the latter evolve on a much larger timescale .",
    "this yields : @xmath87 the constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 in equations ( [ secsol1 ] ) and ( [ secsol2 ] ) are determined by the fact that the inner eccentricity is initially zero and are found to be @xmath90 we are now able to obtain an expression for the inner eccentricity .",
    "averaging over time and over the initial relative phase @xmath35 , the averaged square inner eccentricity will be given by : @xmath91 @xmath92 it should be pointed out here , that the above formula is expected to be rather inaccurate ( in fact , it produces an overestimate for the inner eccentricity ) in situations where the system parameters yield very small values for the quantity @xmath93 , i.e. when we are near to a secular resonance , since , as seen from system ( [ dior ] ) , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the secular frequencies of the inner and outer pericentres respectively .",
    "the parameters of a resonant system should satisfy the equation @xmath96 , which yields : @xmath97 @xmath98 none the less , in this case , one could use a formula which only accounts for the short term evolution of the inner eccentricity , but the formula will be valid only within a few outer orbital periods . in this context , the formula is : @xmath99      in this case , there will be no contribution to the inner eccentricity from the @xmath23 term ( short period and secular ) .",
    "the eccentricity will be dominated by short period terms and the secular contribution is insignificant compared to that of the short period terms ( the only secular contribution to the inner eccentricity comes from the @xmath50 term and is proportional to @xmath100 to leading order ) .",
    "following the same procedure as in the more general case ( differentiating the eccentric vector etc . ) , the components @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the eccentric vector are ( retaining the two leading terms ) : @xmath101 @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 the expression for the averaged square eccentricity in this case is : @xmath105 it is worth mentioning that the term proportional to @xmath106 in equation ( [ em ] ) was neglected in the more general case of the previous section .",
    "eggleton @xmath4 kiseleva ( 1996 ) , in the context of stellar and dynamical evolution of triple stars , and based on results from numerical integrations of coplanar , prograde and initially circular orbits , derived the following empirical formula for the inner mean eccentricity : @xmath107 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 depend on the mass ratios . for three equal masses @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    ".    equation ( [ fegg ] ) can be expanded to first order in terms of @xmath110 , yielding @xmath111 using equations ( [ eq29 ] ) and ( [ eq210 ] ) , for the case of three equal masses , we get : @xmath112 which is in good agreement with the results of eggleton and kiseleva .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , although equation ( [ fegg ] ) was found by eggleton and kiseleva to give good results for some mass ratios , it does not for some other . the explanation for this could be that , the dominant contribution to the eccentricity comes from the @xmath23 term with a factor of @xmath113 and not from the @xmath22 term , as one might expect ( see section [ s1 ] ) .",
    "in order to test the validity of the formulae derived in the previous sections , we integrated the full equations of motion numerically , using a symplectic integrator with time transformation ( mikkola 1997 ) .",
    "the code calculates the relative position and velocity vectors of the two binaries at every time step .",
    "then , by using standard two body formulae , we computed the orbital elements of the two binaries .",
    "the various parameters used by the code , were given the following values : writing index @xmath114 , average number of steps per inner binary period @xmath115 , method coefficients @xmath116 and @xmath117 , correction index @xmath118 .",
    "in all simulations , we confined ourselves to systems with mass ratios within the range @xmath119 since , among stellar triples , mass ratios are rare outside a range of approximately @xmath119 , although such systems would be inherently difficult to recognise ( eggleton @xmath4 kiseleva 1995 ) ; and initial period ratio @xmath120 .",
    "we also used units such that @xmath121 and @xmath122 and we always started the integrations with @xmath123 . in that system of units , the initial conditions for the numerical integrations were as follows : @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the relative position vectors of the inner and outer orbit respectively .",
    "first we tested the validity of equations ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "the integrations and comparison with the analytical results were done for @xmath130 , i.e. the outer binary was ahead of the inner one at right angles . however",
    ", this does not affect the qualitative understanding of the problem at all .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 , which gives the percentage error between the averaged , over time , numerical and theoretical @xmath131 ( the theoretical eccentricity was obtained by evaluating equations ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) everytime we had an output from the symplectic integrator ; both averaged numerical and theoretical eccentricities were calculated by using the trapezium rule ) . the integrations were performed over one outer orbital period time span ( in our system of units , the initial outer orbital period is @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the initial period ratio ) .",
    "for each pair @xmath134 in table 1 , there are five entries , corresponding , from top to bottom , to the following inner binaries : @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "a dash in table 1 denotes that the analogy among the masses was outside the range @xmath119 .",
    "the results show a rather significant error for systems with strong perturbation to the inner binary ( small @xmath133-large @xmath140 ) .",
    "however , the error drops considerably as we move to larger values of @xmath133 ( the error becomes less or close to @xmath141 for @xmath142 ) .",
    "this is consistent with our aim to obtain a reasonable model for the evolution of the inner eccentricity in hierarchical triple systems with well separated components .",
    "one should bear in mind that a period ratio of @xmath143 is considered , as seen in the introduction , to be close to the lower boundary for a hierarchical triple system .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a plot of inner binary eccentricity against time for a system with @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath130 .",
    "the continuous curve has been produced as a result of the numerical integration of the full equations of motion , while the dashed curve is based on equations ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "it is quite obvious that the theory does not work very well for that parameter combination ( also see table 1 ) .",
    "one should note that the maximum eccentricity is of @xmath147 , implying that the inner orbit is close to a circle .",
    "this represents an extreme case of the triple systems studied in this paper , in the sense that the perturbation to the inner binary is strong and therefore , the rest of the systems investigated in this paper , would be expected to have a maximum inner eccentricity of the same or smaller order .",
    "[ fig25 ] demonstrates the inner eccentricity evolution of the same system as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , but for @xmath142 .",
    "the improvement in the theory , as @xmath133 increased , is demonstrated by the good agreement between the numerical ( continuous curve ) and the theoretical result ( dashed curve ) . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows a similar situation as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( i.e. strong perturbation ) , but for the outer binary .",
    "the parameters of the system are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] except @xmath148 this time .",
    "note the satisfactory agreement between the numerical ( continuous curve ) and the theoretical result ( dashed curve based on equations ( [ e21 ] ) and ( [ e22 ] ) ) , although our intention was to compute only the dominant contribution to the outer short period eccentricity .",
    "again , the outer orbit could be approximated by a circle .",
    "hence , the assumption of circular orbits in section ( [ s1 ] ) is well justified .",
    "that was also confirmed when equation ( [ roo5 ] ) was numerically tested against the rate of change of equation ( [ ecve ] ) .",
    "for instance for a system with @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath146 and @xmath130 , for which the perturbation to the inner binary is rather strong , the absolute percentage error between the magnitudes of the exact and the approximate rate of change of the inner eccentric vector oscillated between @xmath151 with a period of approximately half an outer orbital period ( the integration time span was @xmath152 outer orbital period ) .",
    "that oscillation interval was reduced to @xmath153 when @xmath142 and the same reduction analogy ( about @xmath154 ) was also observed in the maximum eccentricity of the two systems , which was consistent with the fact that the error in equation ( [ roo5 ] ) was of order @xmath29 .",
    "hence , the analytical predictions for the eccentricity made by equations ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) should not break down for long evolution timescales .    .percentage error between the averaged numerical and averaged theoretical @xmath131 .",
    "the theoretical model is based on equations ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) . for all systems , @xmath130 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , @xmath155 , @xmath146 and @xmath130 .",
    "the graph comes from numerical integration of the full equations of motion .",
    "the two binary periods are @xmath156 and @xmath157.,width=302,height=226 ]    , @xmath155 , @xmath146 and @xmath130 based on equations ( [ xtot ] ) and ( [ ytot ] ) . note the long period and large amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "the two binary periods are @xmath156 and @xmath157.,width=302,height=226 ]",
    "we have constructed a method to get an estimate of the inner eccentricity in hierarchical triple systems on initially circular and coplanar orbits .",
    "the equations developed throughout this paper , seem to give reasonable results for the parameter ranges discussed .",
    "this can be quite important for systems with close inner binaries .",
    "of course , it is always possible to improve the theory by adding more short period terms in the expansion of the eccentric vector .",
    "our future aim is to expand that kind of calculation to systems with a wider range of orbital characteristics , such as systems with inclined orbits .",
