    "the distribution function of the conductance of disordered systems is very well understood in the metallic regime , but poorly understood in the localized phase . according to the single - parameter scaling ( sps ) hypothesis @xcite the full conductance distribution function",
    "is governed by a single parameter .",
    "it is usual to choose the ratio of the system size @xmath4 to the localization length @xmath5 as the scaling parameter , but one could alternatively choose , for example , the average of the conductance .    the validity of the sps hypothesis has been thoroughly checked in one  dimensional ( 1d ) systems . in this case , it has been shown that , all the cumulants of @xmath1 scale linearly with system size @xcite .",
    "thus , the distribution function of @xmath1 approaches a gaussian form for asymptotically long systems . in this limit , this distribution is fully characterized by two parameters , the mean @xmath6 and the variance of @xmath1 @xmath7 both parameters are related to each other through the relation @xmath8 which justify sps in 1d systems . here",
    "@xmath5 is the localization length , defined in terms of the decay of the average of the logarithm of the conductance as a function of the length of the system @xmath4 as @xmath9 eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) was first derived within the so - called random phase hypothesis @xcite , and it has been proven to hold for most models .",
    "however , it is not verified in the band tails @xcite , in the center of the band @xcite or for very strong disorders @xcite .",
    "the situation in higher dimensions is not as clear as in 1d systems . in those dimensions",
    "is far more difficult to do analytical calculations and numerical simulations have been limited until recently to small sample sizes . in the strong localization regime , @xmath1 was claimed to be normally distributed and the variance was assumed to depend linearly on size in two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that this distribution is not log normal @xcite .",
    "slevin , asada and deych @xcite studied the variance of the liapunov exponent and checked the sps hypothesis in 2d systems .",
    "nguyen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a model to account for quantum interference effects in the localized regime , where the tunneling amplitude between two sites was calculated considering only the shortest or forward - scattering paths . in the sps regime",
    "the localization length must be much larger than the lattice constant , this means that contributions from other paths can not be negligible .",
    "but , as the contribution of each path decay exponentially with its distance , we can expect that some properties of the conductance distribution ( in particular the size dependence ) should be dominated by the shortest paths .",
    "medina and kardar @xcite studied in detail the model .",
    "they computed numerically the probability distribution for tunneling and found that is approximately log normal , with its variance increasing with distance as @xmath10 for 2d systems .",
    "this is in contrast with the 1d case , where the variance grows linearly with distance , and with the implicit assumptions of some works on 2d systems .    for 2d systems",
    ", we found numerically that the variance behaves as @xcite @xmath11 with the exponent @xmath12 equal to @xmath13 .",

    "the constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 are model or geometry dependent .",
    "the precise knowledge of the dependence of @xmath16 with @xmath17 made much easier the numerical verification of the sps hypothesis .",
    "we checked this hypothesis for the anderson model @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the nss model does not verify the sps hypothesis . from a numerical point of view",
    "it is more convenient to use @xmath17 than @xmath18 as the scaling variable , since one does not have to calculate the localization length .",
    "it also facilitates a possible comparison with experiments .",
    "the conductance distribution in the localized regime in 3d systems has been studied recently by marko _",
    "they showed that this distribution is not log normal and tried to fit it with an analytical model @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the different moments of the distribution has not been deeply considered .",
    "the applicability of the sps hypothesis in the critical regime of the anderson model has also been verified @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to find the dependence of the variance of @xmath1 with its average for dimensions higher than two in the strongly localized regime . in particular",
    ", we will investigate if eq .",
    "( [ 2d ] ) is valid in these dimensions , with a dimension dependent exponent @xmath12 .",
    "we will also study the third central moment in 3d systems .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the two models we have used in our calculations . in section 3",
    ", we present the results for the dependence of the variance of @xmath1 in 3d systems .",
    "we will see that our results are consistent with the sps hypothesis . in section 4 , we extent the previous results to four - dimensional ( 4d ) systems and discuss the independent path approximation . in section 5 , we show the behavior of the third cumulant , equal to the third central moment , and the skewness .",
    "we also comment about higher order cumulants .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and extract some conclusions .",
    "we have studied numerically the anderson model for 3d samples and nss model for 3d and 4d samples . for the anderson model ,",
    "we consider cubic samples of size @xmath19 described by the standard anderson hamiltonian @xmath20 where the operator @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron at site @xmath23 of a cubic lattice and @xmath24 is the energy of this site chosen randomly between @xmath25 with uniform probability .",
    "the double sum runs over nearest neighbors .",
    "the hopping matrix element @xmath26 is taken equal to @xmath27 , which set the energy scale , and the lattice constant equal to 1 , setting the length scale .",
    "all calculations with the anderson model are done at an energy equal to 0.01 , to avoid the center of the band .",
    "we have calculated the zero temperature conductance @xmath0 from the green functions .",
    "the conductance @xmath28 is proportional to the transmission coefficient @xmath29 between two semi  infinite leads attached at opposite sides of the sample @xmath30 where the factor of 2 comes from spin . from now on , we will measure the conductance in units of @xmath31 .",
    "the transmission coefficient can be obtained from the green function , which can be calculated propagating layer by layer with the recursive green function method @xcite .",
    "this drastically reduced the computational effort . instead of inverting an @xmath32 matrix , we just have to invert @xmath4 times @xmath33 matrices . with the iterative method we can easily solve cubic samples with lateral dimension from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "we have considered ranges of disorder @xmath36 from 20 to 30 .",
    "the number of different realizations of the disorder employed is of 2000 for most samples .",
    "the leads serve to obtain the conductivity from the transmission formula in a way well controlled theoretically and close to the experimental situation .",
    "we have considered wide leads with the same section as the samples , which are represented by the same hamiltonian as the system , eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , but without diagonal disorder .",
    "we use cyclic periodic boundary conditions in the direction perpendicular to the leads .",
    "we have also studied the nss model @xcite and medina and kardar @xcite in 3d cubic samples and 4d hypercubic samples . in this model ,",
    "one considers an anderson hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , in which the diagonal disorder can only take two values @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "one concentrates on the transmission amplitude between two points in opposite corners of the sample and assumes that the quantum trajectories joining these two points have to follow one of the ( many ) shortest possible paths .",
    "the transmission at zero energy is equal to @xcite @xmath39 where the transmission amplitude @xmath40 is given by the sum over all the directed or forward - scattering paths @xmath41 the contribution of each path , @xmath42 , is the product of the signs of the disorder along the path @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the length of the paths .",
    "the system size @xmath4 is proportional to the path length @xmath44 , with a proportionality constant of the order of unity . considering only directed paths",
    "is well justified in the strongly localized regime , where the contribution of each trajectory is exponentially small in its length .",
    "the variance of @xmath1 is entirely determined by @xmath45 and so it depends on @xmath4 , but not on @xmath36 in this model . to quantify the magnitude of the fluctuations , it is convenient to do it in terms of the length @xmath4 in the nss model . @xmath17 is , of course , proportional to @xmath4 , but the constant of proportionality depends on the disorder @xmath36 .",
    "the assumption of directed paths facilitates the computational problem and makes feasible to handle system sizes much larger than with the anderson hamiltonian .",
    "the sum over the directed path can be obtained propagating layer by layer the weight of the trajectories starting at the initial position and passing through a certain point @xcite . in order to maximize interference effects , it is interesting to consider the initial and final sites at opposite corners of the sample . to simplify the programming complexity of the problem in 3d systems",
    ", we have considered a bcc lattice with the vector joining the two terminal points along the direction ( 1,0,0 ) . in this way we can propagate layer by layer , with each layer being a piece of a square lattice . for 4d systems we consider an `` hyper - bcc '' lattice such that the layers that we handle are pieces of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we have calculated 3d samples with path lengths up to @xmath46 and 4d samples with @xmath44 up to 130 .",
    "we have averaged over @xmath47 realizations of the disorder in 3d systems and over @xmath48 realizations in 4d systems .",
    "the aim of this section is to find if an expression of the form ( [ 2d ] ) also holds for 3d systems with an exponent characteristic of this dimension . to verify this law and to determine numerically this exponent in 3d systems we first use nss model and represent @xmath16 versus @xmath4 on a double - logarithmic scale .",
    "once we have an estimate of the exponent , which in our case turn out to be @xmath49 , it is more demanding to represent @xmath16 as a function of @xmath50 on linear scales . this is what we do in fig .  1 for nss model in 3d systems",
    ". each dot corresponds to a different system size .",
    "we see that the data follow an excellent straight line and so we conclude that , at least in this model , the variance of @xmath1 verify the law @xmath51 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are model and/or geometry dependent constants .",
    "we have taken into account that @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath4 .     as a function of @xmath2 for nss model in 3d systems . ]",
    "nss model is very convenient , because allows us to handle large sample size , but it involves certain approximations and does not satisfy the sps hypothesis , since the variance @xmath16 does not depend on disorder , while @xmath17 depends on both disorder and system size .",
    "moreover , the conductivity of this model would correspond to a system with microscopically narrow leads attached to two points of the system , while in real systems wide leads of the order of the sample size are used .",
    "so , it is desirable to see if the previous results also apply to the anderson model with wide leads . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot @xmath16 as a function of @xmath52 for the anderson model with wide leads in 3d systems for different values of the disorder @xmath53 ( squares ) , 25 ( solid dots ) , 27 ( up triangles ) and 30 ( down triangles ) .",
    "we see that the data again fit a straight line quite well . the straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a least square fit to the data and is given by @xmath54 care must be taken when extracting the power law behavior from a double logarithmic plot of @xmath16 versus @xmath17 , due to the presence of the constant term , which in 3d systems is quite noticeable . obviously , the previous behavior , eq .",
    "( [ lawc ] ) , must break down since the behavior in the metallic part must be very different and , in any case , the variance can not be negative .",
    "the critical point for the metal - insulator transition has been deeply studied and , for periodic boundary conditions , it corresponds to @xmath55 ( in our units ) for the largest sample size employed in ref .   and to 1.329 for the largest size in ref .",
    "the variance at the critical point is in both works equal to 1.09 .",
    "the crossing of our fitted behavior for the variance , eq .",
    "( [ lawc ] ) , with this value of 1.09 gives us an estimate of the average of @xmath56 at the critical point of 1.24 in very good agreement with the values obtained in refs .   .",

    "( [ lawc ] ) to be pretty well satisfied in the entire localized regime down to the critical point .     versus @xmath52 for the anderson model in 3d systems .",

    "these authors calculated numerically the dependence of the variance of @xmath1 with its average and argued that this was compatible with their analytical model . in the strongly localized regime , this model predicts a linear dependence ( @xmath57 ) , in disagreement with our results , which expand a larger range of values of @xmath6 .    the data for the anderson model in fig .  [ fig2 ] for the different values of the disorder overlap within",
    "the error bars in a single line .",
    "the good overlap of the data is a strong support of the validity of the sps hypothesis , since it shows that the variance @xmath16 only depends on the mean of @xmath56 and not on @xmath36 and @xmath4 separately .",

    "an interesting question is to know if eq .",
    "( [ 2d ] ) also applies to 4d systems .",
    "it is quite difficult to check this with the anderson model , but no so with nss model .",
    "we have been able to calculate lateral sizes up to 120 and average over @xmath47 samples .",
    "the results seem to indicate that the variance of @xmath1 goes as the logarithm of @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath16 as a function of @xmath4 in a logarithmic scale .",
    "we note that the data can be fitted fairly well by a straight line . in the inset of fig .",

    "other extrapolation schemes of the power law exponent to four dimensions will likely produce values larger than this one .",
    "it is easy to appreciate in the inset of fig .  3 than the logarithmic fit ( main part of the figure ) is better than this power law fit .",
    "a power law behaviour can not be ruled out if finite size effects were relevant , although in 2d and 3d systems these effects are negligible .     as a function of @xmath4 in a logarithmic scale for nss model in 4d systems .",
    "inset : the same data as in the main part of the figure as a function of @xmath62 . ]    in order to explain the results in 2d and 3d systems , one would have to take into account the correlations between the different trajectories ending in a given point .",
    "an approach has been developed along these lines for 2d systems @xcite .",
    "these authors were interested in calculating @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is given by eq .",
    "( [ mk2 ] ) ( odd powers of @xmath65 cancel by symmetry ) .",
    "they mapped approximately this problem to a quantum system of @xmath66 interacting particles in one dimension less than the real dimension , @xmath67 .",
    "the interaction between particles takes approximately into account the effect on intersections between different paths . as noted by medina and kardar , for dimension @xmath68",
    "( @xmath69 for the quantum system ) there is a possible phase transition , depending on the amount of attraction . for large enough attraction",
    "the @xmath66 particles are bounded ( intersections between paths are important ) , otherwise the attraction becomes asymptotically irrelevant and the behaviour is like free particles ( intersections between paths are irrelevant ) .",
    "obviously the expected relationship between mean and variance of @xmath1 must change if we cross this phase transition . in the case that eq .",
    "( [ law3 ] ) could be applied also to 4d systems it should correspond to the region of bound states .",
    "the nss model does not have free parameters to control the effect of intersections and it seems that for 4d systems we have already crossed the phase transition .",
    "it might be interesting to test eq .",
    "( [ law3 ] ) in the region of bound states , but this requires a new different model .    in order to explain the results for 4d , we may assume that the intersections between paths are asymptotically irrelevant and apply the independent path approach @xcite .",
    "in this approximation one assumes that the contributions @xmath42 of the different paths in eq .",
    "( [ mk2 ] ) are uncorrelated",
    ". then the distribution of @xmath70 tends to a gaussian with zero mean , by symmetry , and a variance proportional to the number of directed paths , which grows exponentially with @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding distribution of @xmath1 , which under these circumstances is the natural variable , presents a mean linearly dependent on @xmath4 and a constant variance .",
    "thus , this approximation predicts @xmath71 .",
    "our results for 4d systems agree with this prediction , although with logarithmic corrections . these might be due to deviations from the central limit and we think that they may persist at any finite dimension .",
    "we have previously shown that in 2d systems , unlike in 1d systems , the distribution of @xmath1 does not tend to a gaussian in the strongly localized regime , since the skewness tends to a constant , different from zero , in the limit of @xmath72 going to infinity @xcite .",

    "the exponent @xmath77 is the one for which the skewness takes to a finite value in 3d systems , given that the variance grows as @xmath2 . as the data follow a straight line , we deduce that the distribution tends to a constant , non gaussian shape .     versus @xmath76 for the model of nss in 3d systems .",

    "the continuous function is obtained from the linear fits in figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the values obtained in the corresponding fits .",
    "we see that finite size effects are very large for the skewness due to the constant terms appearing in the dependence of the variance and ( mainly ) the third moment with @xmath2 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the results for the third cumulant in the anderson model in 3d systems are similar to those of nss model .",
    "the results are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ cumu ] ) , although the error bars are large .",
    "the skewness tends to a constant value .",
    "our estimate of this value is roughly 0.7 , slightly larger than the maximum value obtained in ref .  .",
    "the theorem of marcienkiewicz @xcite shows that the cumulant generating function can not be a polynomial of degree greater than 2 , that is , either all but the first two cumulants vanish or there are an infinite number of nonvanishing cumulants . in the asymptotic limit",
    "the cumulants diverge in general , but we assume that there is a well defined distribution after an appropriate standarization procedure in terms of the variance . then , marcienkiewicz theorem imposes a strong condition on the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants .",

    "then the distribution of @xmath1 tends to a gaussian .",
    "the third possibility , that the exponent characterizing @xmath81 is larger than @xmath84 , would imply the use of this cumulant in the standarization procedure and the normalized variance would tend to zero .",
