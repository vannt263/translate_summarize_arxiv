    "this paper is a survey of some author s results related with the maslov ",
    "shvedov method of complex germ [ 2 ] and with perturbative quantum field theory . these results are , shortly , the following .",
    "firstly , the results from the theory of quantum mechanical schrodinger equation . the maslov ",
    "shvedov method makes it possible to give a simple exposition of the method of canonical operator on a lagrangian manifold with complex germ [ 25 ] of asymptotic solution of the cauchy problem for the schrodinger equation .",
    "it turns out that many maslov ",
    "shvedov s formulas become more simple and get a natural mathematical interpretation if in the schrodinger equation one chooses the weyl ( symmetric ) ordering of multiplication and differentiation operators . in particular",
    ", the transport equation describes the transport of half - forms along the classical trajectory , and the transport of maslov  shvedov wave packets is given by the action of the operator of the weil representation of the metaplectic group corresponding to the tangent symplectic transformation to the hamiltonian flow .",
    "besides that , one obtains a simple and natural definition of the maslov index modulo 4 , related with the complex germ method at a point , which seemingly did not appear in the literature .",
    "a closed exposition of these results is given in  1 .",
    "secondly , the results from perturbative quantum field theory . here introducing the infinite dimensional analog of the weyl algebra allows one not only to interpret the quantum field theory maslov  shvedov complex germ obtained in [ 2 ] by complicated computations ( or , more precisely , to obtain a result close to that result of [ 2 ] ) , but , generally , it allows one to give an exposition of the main results of perturbative quantum field theory not using subtraction of infinities from the hamiltonian of a free field and normal ordering of operators .",
    "the weyl algebra plays the role of an extended algebra of operators in the fock space , where the @xmath0-product corresponds to the composition of operators , while the usual commutative product of functions corresponds to normally ordered product of operators .",
    "this result seems very important for understanding free and perturbative quantum field theory . a closed exposition of these results on the simplest example of the @xmath1 model of quantum field theory in four - dimensional space - time is contained in  2 .",
    "the author is grateful to v.  v.  dolotin , yu .  a.  neretin , and i.  v.  tyutin for helpful discussions .",
    "the schrodinger equation reads @xmath2 here @xmath3 is an unknown complex valued function ( the wave function of a quantum mechanical system ) , @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of the corresponding system of classical mechanics , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 .",
    "this equation is written in such a way that after substitution , instead of @xmath10 , of the _ quasiclassical asymptotics _",
    "@xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real functions varying very slowly when compared with the number @xmath14 ) , in the principal approximation as @xmath15 ( _ the quasiclassical limit _ ) one would obtain the _ hamilton  jacobi equation _ @xmath16 for the function @xmath13 .",
    "the form of the schrodinger equation ( 1 ) has some ambiguity in the general case .",
    "it is related with the fact that the operators of multiplication by a function of @xmath17 and differentiation with respect to @xmath17 , in general , do not commute . hence one should , in general , choose an ordering of these operators in the quantum hamiltonian @xmath18 . in the case of a standard mechanical system without constraints ,",
    "in which @xmath19 there is no such ambiguity .",
    "however , more general and deep considerations require to overcome this ambiguity .",
    "the usual way is to put the operators of differentiation with respect to @xmath17 to the right of operators of multiplication by a function .",
    "let us pose the asymptotic cauchy problem for the schrodinger equation ( 1 ) : take oscillating initial data @xmath20 and let us look for an oscillating function @xmath21 of the form ( 2 ) , which turns into @xmath22 for @xmath23 and satisfies equation ( 1 ) up to @xmath24 . to that end",
    ", two equations should hold : the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation ( 3 ) and the _ transport equation _",
    ", obtained by equating coefficients before @xmath14 in the schrodinger equation , into which the quasiclassical solution ( 2 ) is substituted .",
    "it is not difficult to see that , in the case when all the operators @xmath25 are put to the right of the operators @xmath17 , the transport equation reads @xmath26 thus , our asymptotic cauchy problem has been reduced to the cauchy problem for the system of equations ( 3,6 ) .",
    "it is well known that the cauchy problem for the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation amounts to integration of the system of ordinary _ characteristic _ hamilton differential equations @xmath27 ( see , for example , [ 6 ] , ch .  4 , or [ 1 ] , ch .  2 .",
    ") assume that this problem is already solved .",
    "how can one find the function @xmath28 ?",
    "the transport equation is an ordinary differential equation for the function @xmath12 , giving its behavior along the trajectories of the system of ordinary differential equations ( 7 ) , where @xmath29 .",
    "considering particular cases ( 4 ) from standard quantum mechanics gives a solution of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a characteristic , i.  e. , a solution of the hamilton equations .",
    "indeed , let us differentiate @xmath32 with respect to time : @xmath33 whence @xmath34 this equation differs from the transport equation ( 6 ) by the term @xmath35 which is zero in the standard case ( 4 ) .",
    "it turns out that here the point is the ordering of non - commuting operators @xmath36 and @xmath17 in the hamiltonian .",
    "if we choose a `` right '' ordering ( recall that above we have arbitrarily put @xmath36 to the right of @xmath37 ) , then the difference between equations ( 10 ) and ( 6 ) will disappear .",
    "the choice of a `` right '' ordering is the subject of the following two subsections .      as a simplest example consider the hamiltonian @xmath38 with @xmath39 . for it ,",
    "equation ( 10 ) requires the choice @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 chosen above .",
    "that is , operators @xmath42 and @xmath17 should belong to the hamiltonian symmetrically , without a prescription what stands to the right and what stands to the left . for formalization of these requirements , we need some information on the symplectic group .",
    "consider the general quantum quadratic hamiltonians @xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are symmetric real matrices , @xmath46 is an arbitrary real matrix . in the cauchy problem",
    "let us put the initial condition @xmath47 here @xmath48 is a symmetric complex matrix , @xmath49 is a real vector .",
    "assume that the matrix @xmath50 has positive definite imaginary part , then function ( 13 ) rapidly decreases at infinity ( _ gaussian wave packet _ ) .",
    "it turns out that , as it is not difficult to check by a direct computation , formula ( 8) gives in this case not only asymptotic but exact solution of the cauchy problem : @xmath51 here the sign @xmath52 denotes transposing ; @xmath53 are matrices which can be found in the following way .",
    "the characteristics equations read @xmath54 with the initial conditions @xmath55 these are linear equations , hence , the evolution operator at the time @xmath56 is a linear operator @xmath57 in addition , this operator preserves the poisson bracket of any two functions , as any evolution operator of the canonical hamilton equations , i.  e. , it preserves the bivector field @xmath58 in the language of matrices this condition means that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the unit matrix .",
    "such linear operators are called symplectic , they form the symplectic group @xmath61 .",
    "the set of symmetric complex matrices @xmath50 with positive definite imaginary part is called the _ siegel upper half - plane _ ( cf .",
    "[ 7 ] ) ; denote it by @xmath62 .",
    "the group @xmath61 acts on the half - plane @xmath62 by the formula @xmath63 equivalently , this action can be defined by means of evolution at the time @xmath56 of the matrix riccati equation @xmath64 which is obtained by differentiating the action ( 20 ) with respect to @xmath56",
    ".    formulas ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) define the action of the group @xmath61 on the set of gaussian wave packets .",
    "but this action is two - valued : to make it single - valued , one must choose one of the two continuous branches of the square root from @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "hence a two - fold covering of the group @xmath61 has a single - valued action on the set of gaussian wave packets .",
    "this covering is called the _",
    "metaplectic group _ ; denote it by @xmath67 .",
    "it turns out that the action of the group @xmath67 on the set of gaussian wave packets is uniquely extended by continuousness to the action on the schwartz space @xmath68 of complex valued smooth functions @xmath69 rapidly decreasing at infinity , and also to unitary action on the space @xmath70 of square integrable functions and to the action on the dual to @xmath13 space @xmath71 of tempered distributions .",
    "also the product of matrices yields the composition of operators .",
    "this representation of the group @xmath67 is called the _ weil representation _ , cf . [ 8,9 ] .",
    "the weil representation is uniquely , up to a constant factor , characterized by the following property .",
    "conjugation by an operator @xmath72 corresponding to the matrix @xmath73 , preserves the @xmath74-dimensional vector space of operators with the basis @xmath75 and acts on this space by the matrix @xmath73 .",
    "this is obtained by exponentiating from the fact that the commutator with the hamiltonian ( 12 ) also preserves this space , and acts on it by the matrix @xmath76 , up to the factor @xmath77 .",
    "this property implies the uniqueness of the weil representation as follows .",
    "if @xmath78 is another operator with the same property , then the operator @xmath79 commutes with the operators @xmath37 and @xmath80 , and hence it is multiplication by a constant , as it is not difficult to show .    in particular , the matrix @xmath81 acts by multiplication by the function @xmath82 ; the matrix @xmath83 acts by composition of a linear change of coordinates given by the matrix @xmath84 , and multiplication by @xmath85 .",
    "finally , the matrix @xmath86 acts ( up to a constant factor ) by the fourier transform : @xmath87 this transform exchanges the operators @xmath37 and @xmath88 ( up to sign ) ; the square of this transform is the change of variables @xmath89 . in quantum mechanics",
    "the fourier transform of the wave function is called its momentum representation .",
    "the above matrices generate the group @xmath61 , which gives a proof of existence of an action of the group @xmath61 , defined up to a factor , with the above described commutation relations with the operators ( 22 ) .",
    "note also that exponentiating of operators ( 22 ) yields an action of the so called _ heisenberg group _",
    "@xmath90 on the space of functions .",
    "namely , the operator @xmath91 acts by multiplication by the function @xmath92 , and the operator @xmath93 acts by the change of variables @xmath94 .",
    "the multiplication in the group @xmath90 is defined with the help of the formula @xmath95 ( here @xmath96 is a number ) .",
    "this action is compatible with the action of the group @xmath67 in an obvious sense , so that the space of functions has an action of the _ semidirect product _ of the groups @xmath67 and @xmath90 .",
    "this group is a central extension of the affine symplectic group ( i.  e. , the semidirect product of the group @xmath61 and the group of parallel translations in the space @xmath97 ) with the help of the circle .",
    "let us denote the action of an element @xmath98 of any of these groups ( possibly defined up to a factor ) on the space of functions by the symbol @xmath99      this is a way to assign to a function @xmath100 , @xmath6 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 an operator @xmath103 on the space of functions @xmath69 , this correspondence being in accordance with the action of the affine symplectic group , i.  e. , for any element @xmath98 of this group we have @xmath104 where @xmath105 . the correspondence @xmath106 possesses also the following properties :    \\a ) @xmath107 ;    \\b ) a real function @xmath108 corresponds to a symmetric operator @xmath109 , i.  e. such that @xmath110 for any rapidly decreasing functions @xmath111 , @xmath112 ;    \\c ) appropriate continuousness properties , into which we shall not go , see , for example , hormander s book [ 10 ] .",
    "using these properties one can define the operator @xmath109 for a rather wide class of functions @xmath108 .",
    "first of all , for polynomials @xmath113 the operator @xmath109 is defined uniquely from property  ( a ) . for example , @xmath114 similarly , in algebra a way is known to express each polynomial of @xmath74 variables through powers of linear forms . for any homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath115 of @xmath74 variables there",
    "exists a unique symmetric @xmath115-linear form of @xmath74 variables ( the _ polarization _ of the polynomial ) , which gives this polynomial for coinciding arguments . a polylinear form is a tensor of rank @xmath115 , i.  e. an element of non - commutative algebra of @xmath74 generators . substituting instead of these generators the operators @xmath17 and @xmath42 , we obtain the required operator .",
    "this operation is @xmath116-invariant .",
    "further , we have @xmath117 since many functions @xmath108 can be expressed as superposition of exponents of linear forms using the inverse fourier transform : @xmath118 ( see ( 23 ) ) , we obtain a way to find the required operator for a large class of functions .",
    "let us give the explicit formula for the operator @xmath109 : @xmath119 further , it is not difficult to compute the formula for the _ @xmath0-multiplication _",
    "@xmath120 , i.  e. , for the function corresponding to composition of operators @xmath121 , so that @xmath122 for that one should compute the product of two operators of kind ( 27 ) by formula ( 24 ) , and use the inverse fourier transform ( 28 ) .",
    "let us give the answer .",
    "denote @xmath123 where @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath127 , and @xmath128 .",
    "then @xmath129 this product is usually called the _ moyal product _ ; it is not difficult to check directly that it is associative .",
    "finally , the same formula ( 24 ) implies that the transport equation has the right form ( 10 ) for the hamiltonian being exponent of a linear form , and hence by linearity for any hamiltonian . below the hamiltonian @xmath18 and other quantum observables",
    "will be understood in the sense of weyl calculus .",
    "following maslov and shvedov [ 2 ] , let us look for asymptotic solutions of the schrodinger equation ( 1 ) in the form of wave packets @xmath130 for some functions @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "let us call them _ maslov  shvedov wave packets_. an example of such wave packet is the gaussian wave packet ( 13 ) .",
    "we will find equations on these functions which will imply that the wave packet ( 32 ) satisfies the schrodinger equation up to @xmath24 .    to this end , note that :    \\1 ) action of the operator @xmath135 on the function @xmath10 amounts to action of the operator @xmath136 on the function @xmath137 ;    \\2 ) action of the operator @xmath138 on the function @xmath10 amounts to action of the operator @xmath139 on the function @xmath137 ;    \\3 ) the schrodinger equation ( 1 ) for the function @xmath10 amounts , up to @xmath24 , to the equation @xmath140 ( all derivatives of the hamiltonian are taken at the point @xmath141 ) .",
    "this equation will be satisfied provided the following system of equations holds : @xmath142 these equations mean that @xmath143 is a classical trajectory , @xmath133 is the action along this trajectory , and the function @xmath137 satisfies the schrodinger equation with the quadratic hamiltonian depending on time , with @xmath144 .",
    "this latter equation means the following .",
    "the quadratic part of the hamiltonian at each point of the trajectory gives an infinitesimal symplectic transformation : @xmath145 the composition of all these transformations at the time @xmath56 gives a metaplectic transformation @xmath146 whose action on the function @xmath147 under the weil representation gives the function @xmath134 .",
    "in particular , if we look for the function @xmath137 in the form of a gaussian function @xmath148 then for the function @xmath149 we get a matrix riccati equation @xmath150 of type ( 21 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath151 is called the _",
    "complex germ_.    it is rather interesting to express these equations in terms of the functions @xmath152 and the lagrange function @xmath153 , i.  e. , to rewrite them in the language of the variational principle .",
    "then equation ( 34 ) turns into the jacobi equation in the theory of second variation , and equation ( 38 ) turns into the corresponding matrix riccati equation , see gelfand ",
    "fomin s book [ 11 ] , cf .",
    "but in the variational calculus the matrix @xmath50 is real ; this case will be considered below .",
    "in conclusion we shall briefly discuss the powerful method of canonical operator , due to v.  p.  maslov .",
    "this method allows one , for example , to write out the asymptotic solution of the cauchy problem for the schrodinger equation ( see 1.2 ) .",
    "formulas ( 2 ) , ( 8) , ( 3 ) yield this solution for @xmath56 sufficiently small , when different characteristics do not intersect each other and @xmath154 .",
    "method of canonical operator shows what happens with the solution after passing through _ focal points _ , where characteristics intersect each other and the determinant vanishes .",
    "to this end , let us represent the solution ( 2 ) as a superposition of wave packets ( 32 ) satisfying equations ( 33 ) : @xmath155 @xmath156 .",
    "let us first consider the case when the @xmath157-dimensional submanifold @xmath158 , @xmath159 of the phase space @xmath160 diffeomorphically projects onto the @xmath161-plane .",
    "let us develop the expression under the exponent into the taylor series in a vicinity of the point @xmath162 for which @xmath163 , and let us make change of variables @xmath164 we obtain @xmath165 hence @xmath166 will not decrease more rapidly than any power of @xmath14 only in the case when @xmath167 below we will assume that this equality holds identically .",
    "it implies that @xmath168 for all @xmath169 . in other words ,",
    "the symplectic differential 2-form @xmath170 vanishes on the submanifold @xmath171 of the phase space .",
    "maslov called such submanifolds lagrangian .",
    "conversely , any lagrangian submanifold diffeomorphically projecting onto the @xmath161-plane , is the graph of the differential of some function @xmath172 : @xmath173 equality ( 41 ) also implies that @xmath174 where @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "let us now assume that the lagrangian submanifold has been transformed by the hamiltonian flow ( 7 ) on the phase space at the time @xmath56 .",
    "what then happens with the functions @xmath177 and @xmath178 ?",
    "recall that on each trajectory the tangent metaplectic transformation ( 35 ) arises .",
    "denote it by @xmath98 .",
    "then in the formula ( 45 ) the following changes will occur :    \\1 ) @xmath179 are transformed by the flow ;    \\2 ) @xmath180action along the trajectory ;    \\3 ) @xmath181 , @xmath182 ;    \\4 ) @xmath183 .",
    "how is @xmath178 transformed ? to answer this question let us study what is @xmath184 , as promised at the end of 1.5 .",
    "denote @xmath185 .",
    "now @xmath50 is real .",
    "moreover , @xmath186 does not belong now to the schwartz space and to @xmath187 .",
    "it is the unique , up to proportionality , distribution solution of the system of equations @xmath188 the transformation @xmath98 takes these equations to the equations @xmath189 which , for @xmath190 , are equivalent to the equations on the gaussian function @xmath191 .",
    "moreover , as it is shown by taking the limit in equalities ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) as @xmath192 , @xmath193 ( @xmath194 is the imaginary part of the matrix @xmath50 ) , for @xmath190 we have @xmath195 for some integer @xmath115 called the _",
    "maslov index_. this index has a purely algebraic definition , see , for example , hormander s book [ 10 ] ,  21.6 .",
    "as far as we know , the above simple definition of the maslov index did not appear in the literature .    in the general case ( when @xmath196 can equal 0 ) it is easy to see that the system of equations ( 47 ) forms a basis of a ( real ) lagrangian subspace @xmath197 in the @xmath74-dimensional vector space with the basis @xmath198 i.  e. , an @xmath157-dimensional subspace on which the symplectic form , given by the commutator of operators , vanishes .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the solution @xmath199 of this system is , in general case , up to a constant factor , the product of a function of type @xmath200 of part of the variables , for a real @xmath50 , and the delta function of the remaining variables ( after an appropriate linear change of coordinates @xmath201 ) .",
    "the most degenerate case is the system of equations @xmath202 , @xmath125 , whose solution is the delta function @xmath203 .",
    "thus , we have described the @xmath67-orbit of functions @xmath200 for real @xmath50 , or , which is the same , the orbit of the function @xmath204 in the projectivization @xmath205 of the space @xmath206 of distributions .",
    "this orbit is isomorphic to the variety of real lagrangian subspaces of the @xmath74-dimensional symplectic vector space .",
    "this variety is called the _ lagrangian grassmannian _ ; denote it by @xmath207 .",
    "the embedding @xmath208 induces a complex line bundle @xmath209 on the grassmannian @xmath207 , whose fiber at the point @xmath210 is the line @xmath211 .",
    "this bundle has an action of the group @xmath67 .",
    "trivializations and transition functions of this bundle can be obtained from formula ( 48 ) .",
    "let us call this bundle @xmath209 the _ maslov bundle _ ( hormander [ 10 ] ,  21.6 , uses another terminology and calls the bundle @xmath209 the tensor product of the half densities bundle and the maslov bundle ) .",
    "returning to formula ( 45 ) , we see ( assuming that @xmath212 belongs to the schwartz space with respect to @xmath201 ) that under the action of the hamiltonian flow the function @xmath178 is multiplied by @xmath213 if after the transformation by the flow the lagrangian manifold still diffeomorphically projects onto the @xmath161-plane ( i.  e. , if @xmath214 )",
    ". this result generalizes formula ( 8) .",
    "let us now return to the integral ( 39 ) and consider it in the case when the manifold @xmath158 , @xmath159 not necessarily diffeomorphically projects onto the @xmath161-plane . in this case",
    "let us present the function @xmath215 as sum of functions @xmath216 , each of which has the support with respect to the variable @xmath217 diffeomorphically projecting onto some lagrangian plane in the phase space .",
    "then let us apply to these functions linear hamiltonian flows ( 15 ) , giving metaplectic transformations @xmath218 , so that these lagrangian planes get to the @xmath161-plane .",
    "after that let us apply formula ( 45 ) .",
    "we obtain a wave function @xmath219 .",
    "finally , let us apply to these wave functions the transformations @xmath220 , and let us take the sum of them . the obtained wave function @xmath166 ( which is , in general , a distribution )",
    "is defined correctly up to @xmath221 if the maslov index of any closed curve on the lagrangian manifold is divisible by 4 .",
    "the role of function @xmath178 is played here by a section of the maslov bundle on the lagrangian manifold , induced from the bundle @xmath209 on the lagrangian grassmannian .",
    "thus , the method of canonical operator assigns a ( distribution ) wave function @xmath166 , defined up to @xmath221 , to a lagrangian submanifold and to a section of the maslov bundle on it . in the case",
    "when the lagrangian submanifold is the graph of differential of a function @xmath172 , the wave function has the form ( 45 ) . under the evolution given by the schrodinger equation , the corresponding hamiltonian flow on the phase space transforms the lagrangian manifold and the section of the maslov bundle on it , and hence transforms the wave function @xmath166 .",
    "this gives the global asymptotic solution of the cauchy problem .",
    "the method of canonical operator has far generalizations .",
    "for example , if one integrates not along @xmath157-dimensional but along @xmath115-dimensional ( @xmath222 ) isotropic submanifold , then one obtains the _ method of canonical operator on a lagrangian manifold with complex germ_. the method of complex germ also applies to approximate solution of linear and even non - linear partial differential equations , and not only to the schrodinger equation .",
    "see maslov s books [ 35 ] .",
    "consider a field theory action functional of the form @xmath223 where @xmath224 are the independent variables , @xmath225 are the dependent variables , @xmath226 , and integration goes over an @xmath227-dimensional surface @xmath228 ( the graph of the functions @xmath229 ) with the boundary @xmath230 in the space @xmath231 .",
    "the main simplest example for our considerations is the @xmath1 model in four dimensions : @xmath232 the schrodinger equation for the model ( 51 ) reads @xmath233 here @xmath234 ;      @xmath238 is the density of the hamiltonian of the theory , which equals the legendre transform of the lagrangian @xmath239 with respect to the variables @xmath240 ; denote the dual variables to @xmath240 by @xmath241 ;      as in quantum mechanics , here the problem arises of ordering of the operators @xmath236 and @xmath243 in the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "let us not consider this problem now , all the more in the case of the @xmath1 model there is no such ambiguity .",
    "the schrodinger equation ( 53 ) is obviously relativistically non - invariant .",
    "but one can write out a relativistically invariant version of this equation , in which the surface @xmath244 in the space - time is changed by an arbitrary space - like surface , and the functional @xmath235 depends on this surface and on functions @xmath245 on it , where @xmath246 , @xmath6 , @xmath247 are parameters on the surface .",
    "this relativistically invariant version is obtained in exactly the same way as the usual quantum mechanical schrodinger equation , by the formal substitution into the generalized field theory hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation , see [ 6 ] . in physical literature a close equation is called the tomonaga  schwinger equation [ 13 ] , and the problem of solving this equation is called quantization on space - like surfaces .    one can give a rigorous mathematical sense to the schrodinger equation ( 53 ) and its relativistically invariant generalization . to this end ,",
    "the conventional usual way is to consider weakly continuously differentiable sufficient number of times functionals on a nuclear space of functions @xmath245 , for example , on the schwartz space . in this interpretation , for example ,",
    "the variational derivative @xmath248 is a distribution in @xmath249 , the second variational derivative @xmath250 is a distribution in @xmath251 , etc .",

    "indeed , if it were so ( as it was assumed in past , see , for example , [ 14,15 ] , etc . ) , then the values of these functionals or related quantities , in principle , could be measured . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known ( see , for example ,  1 of the book [ 16 ] by berestetsky , lifschitz , and pitaevsky ) that in relativistic quantum dynamics , quantum mechanical quantities like energy and momentum are theoretically non - measurable , and the only measurable quantities are the scattering sections .",
    "besides that , one would like to have that in the case of free scalar field given by a quadratic hamiltonian , the schrodinger equation be solved exactly , similarly to the finite dimensional case .",

    "we will be interested only in some concrete computations in the weyl algebra .",
    "in algebraic quantum field theory [ 17,18,19 ] a somewhat different definition of weyl algebra is adopted .",
    "below we will see that the weyl algebra allows one to construct a logically self - consistent theory of free quantum scalar field and to simplify drastically perturbative theory of interacting quantum fields .",
    "thus , operators in equations ( 53 ) , ( 54 ) , and others will be understood as elements of the weyl algebra . and",
    "how will be understood states @xmath235 ? they already can not be functionals of @xmath270 , since the weyl algebra does not act on them . in the case of a finite dimensional symplectic vector space ,",
    "the weyl algebra acts canonically on _ half - forms _ on a lagrangian subspace . in coordinates @xmath271 half - forms look @xmath272 , @xmath6 , @xmath273 @xmath274 .",

    "author s attempts to construct half - forms failed to be success ( see , for example , [ 20 ] ) .",
    "but actually , in order to obtain physically important quantities for free field , we need not states : it suffices to use only operators , as will be shown below .",
    "states are `` non - observable neither physically nor mathematically '' .",

    "bogolyubov @xmath13-matrix _ , or the _ scattering matrix_. this @xmath13-matrix satisfies the _ lorentz invariance , unitarity and causality _ conditions . in the weyl algebra",
    "these conditions go to the corresponding conditions for the element @xmath449 .",
    "the lorentz invariance condition is obvious : @xmath455 for a lorentz transformation @xmath197 .",
    "the unitarity condition means that @xmath456 finally , the causality condition states that for two functions @xmath457 and @xmath458 , coinciding for @xmath459 , the element @xmath460 does not depend on the behavior of the functions @xmath461 , @xmath462 for @xmath463 .",
    "these conditions are the natural substitutes of the conditions for the dynamical evolution .",
    "in particular , the causality condition is the natural substitute of the condition of dependence of the evolution operator of a linear differential equation on the coefficient functions of this equation . in bogolyubov ",
    "shirkov s book [ 13 ] it is shown that these conditions define the @xmath13-matrix uniquely , up to adding finite terms to the lagrangian .",
    "hence it is natural to postulate the existence of the elements @xmath449 and @xmath451 outside of the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "the physical sense of the @xmath13-matrix is the following .",
    "assume that , as the function @xmath443 , remaining a function with increasing compact support , tends to the constant function @xmath464 ( the _ adiabatic interaction switch off _ ) , the elements @xmath451 and @xmath449 tend to some elements @xmath13 ( the physical @xmath13-matrix ) and @xmath465 .",
    "then the square of the absolute value of the matrix element ( 86 ) ( with @xmath466 ) of the physical @xmath13-matrix is the density of probability of the event that @xmath349 colliding particles , flying before collision with 4-momenta @xmath350 , @xmath6 , @xmath351 , after collision turn into @xmath467 particles flying away with 4-momenta @xmath468 , @xmath6 , @xmath469 .    up to @xmath24 the element",
    "@xmath465 gives the operator @xmath439 of quasiclassical dynamical evolution from @xmath398 : @xmath437 to @xmath399 : @xmath438 , see 2.4.9 .",
    "the definition of dynamical evolution ( up to @xmath24 ) , suitable outside perturbation theory , can be found in 2.4.4 .",
    "let us also comment on the non - uniqueness of @xmath13-matrix .",
    "actually it depends not only on the initial lagrangian , but also on effective parameters , for example , on effective mass and effective coupling constant , which are computed from the @xmath13-matrix and which already define it uniquely . and any change of effective parameters is equivalent to certain change of parameters of initial lagrangian .    in a similar manner one constructs",
    "the apparatus of the operator and scalar green functions , with the help of the lagrangian @xmath470 their construction , including the subtraction procedure , does not yield new difficulties , and is made similarly to what is done in the bogolyubov ",
    "shirkov s book .",
    "note that the above constructed apparatus of the @xmath13-matrix and conditions on it are analogous to the scattering theory in the theory of partial differential equations , where , given the coefficient functions of the equation , one is required to determine the properties of the evolution operator from @xmath437 to @xmath438 .",
