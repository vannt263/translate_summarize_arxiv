    "also , there is a clear separation between ultraviolet and infrared physics from the point of view of the renormalization group .    in string theory , however , there is growing evidence that the physics at short distances , in contrast to local quantum field theory , is not clearly separated from the physics at long distances @xcite . the fundamental formulation of this",

    "in this situation , another type of uncertainty relation involving spatial and temporal coordinates is found to hold : @xmath8 @xcite . ]",

    "@xcite , we determined the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator when the position and momentum obey eq .",

    "@xcite was that various observable effects of the minimal length uncertainty relation are non  perturbative in the `` deformation parameter '' @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ contain all orders in @xmath10 ) even though @xmath10 appears only to linear order in eqs .",
