    "conductance spectra of quasi-1d semiconductor structures display many features that expose directly the quantum nature of carrier transport , and are of great interest both for applications and fundamental understandings@xcite . even in the simplest non - interacting carriers approach ,",
    "the departure from a constant section of the wire gives rise to complex resonance patterns in the quantum transmission .",
    "this originates from the coherent coupling of the energy spectra of different subbands and from the interplay of traveling and localized states@xcite . indeed , the case of a discrete energy spectrum merged with a continuum one ,",
    "was considered by fano@xcite in his seminal work on inelastic scattering amplitudes of electrons . in that case , the two hamiltonians with discrete and continuous spectra were that of the electronic degree of freedom of an atom and that of a free electron , respectively .",
    "it was shown that the coupling induced by the coulomb interaction led to a peculiar asymmetric shape of the scattering probability and a discontinuity of the scattering phase .",

    "the potential well is fully contained in the twisted region . ]",
    "a local attractive potential is also included , in order to give rise to a discrete set of bound states and to fano resonances in the transmission spectra : they will expose the energy of quasi - bound states of the twisted qw .",
    "we stress that our results are representative of a more general case , as for example a carrier scattered through a quantum dot embedded in a qw or a qw whose hamiltonian is not separable in the transverse and longitudinal directions , leading to localized states .    the effect of twisting on the conductance is twofold . on one side",
    ", it is expected to reduce the conductance@xcite . on the other side ,",
    "this reduction can be compensated by a partial destruction of localization effects ( e.g. due to external fields or impurities ) , induced by the twisting itself .",
    "in fact , by means of the complex scaling method it has been shown@xcite that stable states associated to a trapping potential may become resonant states when the qw is twisted . in this paper",
    "we numerically compute the real and imaginary part of such resonances as a function of the twisting parameter in an explicit model and we prove that , for such a model , the imaginary part of these resonances actually takes a negative value , this indicating that the corresponding states become unstable . specifically ,",
    "our results show that the energy of bound states of the quantum well in the longitudinal direction is increased by the twist and , as they enter the continuous - spectrum range of traveling states , they appear in the the transmission characteristic as symmetric ( breit - wigner  @xcite ) or asymmetric ( fano  @xcite ) resonant peaks , according to the character of the original bound wave function .",
    "the width of the resonances is related to the imaginary component of the eigenvalues of the complex - scaled hamiltonian  @xcite , as we detail in the following , and shows a non - monotonic behavior .",
    "a resonant peak may or may not disappear when its energy reaches the transmission channel with the same transverse energy as the original bound state , according to the corresponding bound state in the straight qw . indeed , the knowledge of the bound states of the straight qw allows one to predict the position and type of transmission resonances in the twisted system .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the model of the twisted qw and , in the following sect .  [ sec3 ] , we outline the real - space numerical approach adopted for the calculation of the scattering states and transmission amplitudes on a non - cartesian grid . in sect .",

    "[ sec5 ] we draw our conclusions . in the final appendix , analytical details of the complex - scaling approach mentioned in the main text , are given .",
    "we consider a qw with rectangular cross - section , with an hard - wall confinement . for a straight wire , an elementary solution of the single - band effective - mass schrdinger equation",

    "the subband index @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) has been introduced , summarizing the two positive integers @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath12 can be any real number , it is clear that the energy spectrum is continuum , with @xmath18 .    a confining potential well ( depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ]",

    "we stress that the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) has been chosen both to mimic a `` smooth '' local confinement and to deal with a potential that has an exact expression for its bound - state eigenvalues  @xcite : @xmath25 where the ceiling function @xmath26 indicates the smallest integer not less than @xmath20 .",
    "the above expression is essential to approach analytically the problem through the complex scaling method , that we use to follow the energy vs. twist behavior of the bound states .",
    "the energetic spectrum of the schrdinger operator for the qw with @xmath22 consists of a discrete and a continuum part @xmath27 for energies above @xmath28 the two parts overlap and eigenvalues of the discrete spectrum are embedded in the continuum spectrum .",
    "however , the two sub - spectra remain well distinct since the system hamiltonian is separable in a transverse ( @xmath29-@xmath30 plane ) and a longitudinal ( @xmath13 direction ) component .",
    "in fact , if a given energy corresponds to a discrete level and , at the same time , it lies inside the continuum , the corresponding state will be degenerate , with the different eigenfunctions having a different transverse state . in terms of quantum transport along the qw , the above system does not mix different transmission channels or propagating states with bound ones .",
    "let us now introduce a local twist in the qw .",
    "as we will show , this couples different transverse modes , mixing their spectra , and shifts the energy of the discrete states .",

    "the qw is essentially straight .    for our simulations , we use gaas effective electron mass @xmath38 and adopt the following set of geometric parameters : @xmath39  nm , @xmath40  nm , @xmath41  nm ( i.e. the twisted region is about @xmath42  nm ) , @xmath43 . two attractive potentials , as given in eq .",

    "the energy of a bound state of the straight qw is indicated with @xmath51 , with @xmath52 indicating the transverse mode , and @xmath53 the bound state of @xmath22 in the longitudinal direction .",
    "while the @xmath54 s are fixed , the @xmath51 s are increased by the twist . ]    for brevity , the energies of the discrete states are indicated by @xmath55 in the following .",
    "we stress that the transverse energies @xmath54 are fixed , since the cross - section is constant , although rotated .",
    "contrary , the position of @xmath51 depends upon the twist , as we will analyze in detail in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "in fact , they are the resonant energies that correspond to a local maximum ( breit - wigner ) or a zero ( fano ) in the transmission spectra .",
    "to obtain the transmission amplitudes of the twisted qw we solve the 3d schrdinger equation with open boundaries through the quantum transmitting boundary method  @xcite ( qtbm ) .",
    "electrons are injected from the left lead ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in a given transverse mode , and can be either reflected or transmitted to the right lead . with this boundary condition , the differential equation of motion is solved in the internal points of the domain , leading to complex transmission / reflection amplitudes for every channel of the right / left leads .",
    "we adopt a curved coordinate system naturally defined by the twist function of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath56 .",
    "this new coordinate system follows the qw twist and `` sees '' a straight qw .",
    "however , also the equation of motion must be transformed according to the @xmath57 relation . in order to do so",
    ", we need the metric tensor of the system @xmath58 with components @xmath59 , together with its inverse @xmath60 with components @xmath61 . here , we used the definitions @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the curved coordinate system",
    "the hamiltonian reads  @xcite : @xmath64 ,                               \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the determinant of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "now it is easy to define a rectangular mesh following the qw in the new coordinate system , and discretize @xmath68 through a finite - difference scheme .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath69 is then solved , with open boundary conditions at the two edges of the qw , as described above .",
    "the qtbm takes as an input the kinetic energy @xmath70 of the incoming electron and the wave function of the transverse mode @xmath52 , and gives as an output the transmission / reflection amplitudes in the different channels  @xcite . for this reason , a new calculation",
    "must be performed for every @xmath71 in a chosen set over the range of interest , with @xmath72 .    actually , in order to find the resonances we also used a complementary technique : the complex scaling approach described in appendix  @xcite .",
    "this method leads to a complex - eigenvalue problem that allows one to identify in a straightforward way the resonances originated by the bound states of @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , it gives the energy levels of bound states below @xmath73 , not achievable with the qtbm .",
    "in fact , the qtbm gives the transmission amplitude of the different transverse modes as a function of the carrier energy , and the position of transport resonances must be detected subsequently , as a relevant peak or dip in the transmission probability and as a continuum ( abrupt ) phase shift for a breit - wigner ( fano ) resonance .",
    "however , the complex scaling method results to be very demanding from the computational point of view and we used its results only as a reference for specific cases .",
    "we leave the comparison of the two methods to a subsequent work .",
    "as anticipated in section  [ sec2 ] the transmission spectra of the straight qw can be obtained from a one - dimensional equation of motion with the potential @xmath22 . in order to mix transmission channels ,",
    "the transverse / longitudinal separability must be lifted",
    ". however , a generic deformation of the qw section along the wire , not only couples different transverse modes , but also introduces additional resonant energies , as in the case of a closed cavity attached at a side  @xcite .",
    "this can make difficult to expose the sole effect of the coupling between the continuum and discrete spectra .",
    "for this reason , as well as for technological relevance , we choose a kind of deformation that does not alter the shape of the qw cross section , but only its orientation , and does not introduce further resonances .",
    "in fact , the qw twist has only two effects : first , it couples the transmission channels so that the transmission probability for a carrier injected in a given transverse mode also has traces of quasi - bound states of different modes ; second , it increases the energies of quasi - bound states .    , for @xmath4 .",
    "the resonant energies correspond to the real part of the complex - scaled eigenvalues .",
    "the threshold energies of the ground and first - excited transverse modes are indicated by the two horizontal lines labeled as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the three curves correspond to the quasi - bound states @xmath75 ( dotted line ) , @xmath76 ( dashed line ) , @xmath77 ( solid line ) .",
    "bottom panel : imaginary part of the complex - scaled eigenvalues , corresponding to the half width of the resonance peaks or dips . while the two fano resonances @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( see also fig .  [ fig4 ] ) disappear as they reach @xmath74",
    ", @xmath77 is still present in the spectrum at energies exceeding @xmath74 in the form of a broad and shallow dip ( see also fig .  [ fig5 ] ) . ]",
    "these effects can be seen from the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we report the position ( top panel ) and width ( bottom panel ) of the resonances in the transmission spectrum of the ground transverse channel , as a function of the twist angle .",
    "in particular , for each angle @xmath35 we inject a carrier in the ground transverse mode ( with energy @xmath73 ) and with several longitudinal kinetic energies , from zero to @xmath78 . from the curves of transmission amplitude vs. total energy @xmath71 ( see e.g. figs .  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) we determine the position of the resonances and obtain the imaginary part of the eigenvalue as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the peak or dip width .",
    "note that the above complex eigenvalues correspond to quasi - bound states with a mean lifetime @xmath81 of the order of @xmath82  ps .    by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with the levels of the straight qw given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the origin of the two resonances at higher energy ( dotted and dashed lines in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) is clear .",
    "in fact , for @xmath83 only two quasi - bound levels lie between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , namely @xmath76 and @xmath75 .",
    "they both belong to channel @xmath84 so that at zero twist , they do not appear in the transmission spectrum , as it can be gathered from the vanishing imaginary part of their eigenvalue in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as the twist",
    "is introduced , the two levels above appear as slightly asymmetric fano dips in the transmission probability , as reported in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the case of @xmath85 .",
    "however , the fano character of the resonances is better revealed by the abrupt jump of @xmath86 in the transmission phase @xmath87 , as shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "( left panels ) and @xmath75 ( right panels ) for a twist angle @xmath85 . in both cases ,",
    "the phase @xmath87 shows the typical @xmath86 discontinuity of fano resonances . ]    the third resonance of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( solid line ) appears around @xmath88 from the low - energy threshold @xmath73 .",
    "it is again a fano resonance , as can be gathered from the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , showing the transmission probability and phase at @xmath89 .",
    "this is confirmed by results of the complex - scaling approach , ascribing the resonance to the quasi - bound level @xmath77 .     for two different twist angles , namely @xmath89 ( left panels ) and",
    "@xmath90 ( right panels , solid line ) . in the first case @xmath91 , and a sharp fano dip is found . in the second case @xmath92 , and its position",
    "is only indicated by a very shallow dip . in the latter case , also",
    "the transmission spectrum of the first - excited mode is reported ( dashed line ) , revealing a pronounced breit - wigner resonance . ]    in fact , as the twist increases from @xmath93 to @xmath86 , both levels @xmath77 and @xmath94 reach the threshold @xmath73 .",
    "however , while the former shows up as a resonance in the transmission spectrum , the latter disappears as it enters the traveling - states region , with its imaginary part going to zero .",
    "again , this behavior can be traced by the complex scaling method alone , since the lower energy accessible with the qtbm is @xmath73 .",
    "when @xmath77 enters the energy range of first - mode traveling states , it appears as a fano resonance since it is a second - mode quasi - bound state .",
    "moreover , contrary to the other two resonances , it appears with a significant width ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) from the beginning , since at @xmath88 the coupling between the modes is already strong",
    ".    when the twist increases from @xmath86 to @xmath95 the three quasi - bound levels described above also increase their energy .",
    "however , as @xmath76 and @xmath75 approach the threshold of the second channel , their width decreases and they finally disappear , with the width going to zero , when their energy reaches @xmath74 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath77 is different .",
    "in fact , its resonance width is always of the order of @xmath96 until the energy reaches @xmath74 , where the width increases by order of magnitudes .",
    "this is shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the transmission probability ( top ) and phase ( bottom ) are shown , for a twist @xmath90 .",
    "here , @xmath92 , and the second transmission channel becomes available .",
    "the solid line is the first - channel to first - channel transmission , and shows a tiny dip at the quasi - bound state position , reminiscent of the prominent fano dip of the single - channel case .",
    "the dashed line is the second - channel to second - channel transmission , showing a clear breit - wigner resonance with the corresponding continuous phase lapse of @xmath86 .  @xcite this is not surprising , since in this case",
    "the quasi - bound state has the same transverse mode of the transmission channel .",
    "the case with @xmath5 , with a deeper potential well @xmath22 in the twisted region , presents additional effects .",
    "in fact , at zero twist the energy range between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where only the ground channel is open , contains bound states of two different transverse modes , namely the first excited ( @xmath75 and @xmath97 ) and the second excited ( @xmath98 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as the wire is twisted , the energy of the above three quasi - bound states increases , as illustrated in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    , but for a deeper potential well , with @xmath5 . here ,",
    "four quasi - bound states with a first - excited transverse mode are present : @xmath77 ( solid line , with filled circles ) , @xmath76 ( dashed line ) , @xmath75 ( dotted line ) , @xmath97 ( dot - dashed line ) , together with a quasi - bound state with a second - excited transverse mode : @xmath98 ( solid line with empty squares ) .",
    "the two resonances @xmath98 and @xmath97 , with different transverse modes , cross around @xmath89 with a repulsion of their imaginary components .",
    "all the resonances in the @xmath99 $ ] range are of fano type . ]",
    "however , the level @xmath98 ( solid line with empty squares ) increases faster than the other two , it crosses @xmath97 around @xmath89 and goes beyond @xmath74 .",
    "first of all we note again that , in the @xmath99 $ ] range , the transport resonances corresponding to the above quasi - bound states are fano resonances , in agreement with the fact that they originate from a transverse mode different from that of the transport channel .",
    "this is shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , reporting the transmission probability and phase of the ground channel at @xmath89 , just after the crossing . at the crossing",
    ", we also find a _ repulsion _ of the imaginary component of the eigenvalues , visible in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .     just after the crossing with @xmath97 ( at @xmath89 , left panels ) and above the second mode threshold @xmath74 ( at @xmath100 , right panels ) . in the first case the @xmath86 discontinuities of the transmission phase evidence the fano character of the resonances . in the second case a third channel is available , and",
    "the resonance does not present either fano or breit - wigner character . ]    when @xmath101 , i.e. it enters the energy region with two transport channels , it does not disappear , as @xmath75 and @xmath97 do at larger twist , but simply changes its characters .",
    "now the minimum of the dip does not reach zero , and the phase does not present the @xmath86 discontinuity ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , right panels ) . here in fact , a third transmission channel is available , this lifting the rigid zero - transmission properties of a two - channel case fano resonance .",
    "as already mentioned , the two resonances @xmath75 and @xmath97 , present in the spectrum since small twist angles , disappear as they reach @xmath74 , with their width going to zero .",
    "two additional resonances enter the ground - mode region at larger twists : @xmath76 and @xmath77 , represented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] by a dashed line and a solid line , respectively .",
    "they are also fano resonances , but after reaching @xmath74 they do not vanish .",
    "in fact , their width increases and their minimum does not reach zero , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for @xmath76 .",
    "obviously , in this region they are also present in the transmission spectrum of the first - excited channel as breit - wigner resonances ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , since their transverse mode is the first - excited one as well .",
    "correspondingly , their transmission phase presents a smooth evolution of @xmath86 .",
    "for the system with @xmath5 .",
    "two different twist angles are considered , with the resonance close to the second - channel threshold : @xmath102 ( left panels ) , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( right panels ) , where @xmath105 . in the second case , both",

    "[ fig7 ] , after the crossing of @xmath74 the @xmath86 discontinuity of the phase is lost , due to the availability of a third transmission channel .",
    "the broad peak in the first - excited channel is a breit - wigner resonance . ]",
    "by solving the open - boundary schrdinger equation through the qtbm we obtained the transmission spectra of the twisted qw .",
    "the effect of the twist can be summarized in the following points .",
    "_ first _ , the twist is able to mix different transmission channels in spite of the fact that the transverse qw section is not altered ( but only rotated ) .",
    "furthermore , bound states of @xmath22 are coupled to traveling states and appear as resonance peaks / dips in the transmission spectra .",
    "no additional resonances are introduced .",
    "_ second _ , the character of the resonance depends upon the transverse mode of the original bound state .",
    "in fact , when the latter is equal to the transverse mode of the transmission channel , we find a breit - wigner resonance , otherwise we find a fano resonance . in case",
    "more than two channels are available , we do not find the @xmath86 discontinuity of the transmission phase typical of fano resonances .",
    "_ third _ , the twist increases the energy of quasi - bound levels",
    ". the higher the transverse mode of the quasi - bound state , the faster its energy is increased . however , the change of resonance width is non - monotonic with the twist . in general",
    ", it increases from zero when the energy of the bound state is already in the transport region in the straight qw , and decreases as the above energy reaches the threshold of the transmission channel with the same transverse mode as the quasi - bound state .",
    "_ forth _ , resonances that are present from the beginning in the first - channel region disappear as they reach @xmath74 , while resonances that enter the @xmath73-@xmath74 region at a finite twist , persist in the multi - channel region .",
    "the strict behavior described above could help in anticipating the characters of transmission spectra of qw locally twisted once the spectra of the straight wire is known .",
    "furthermore , it supports the idea that the twist can reduce the effects of localized states on quantum conductance , since it shifts their levels towards higher energies , possibly beyond fermi level of the quasi-1d nanostructure .",
    "we thank p.  bordone , g.  ferrari and h.  kovak for most helpful discussions .",
    "so far we have identified resonant energies with singular points of the reflection / transmission coefficient . in the framework of the complex scaling method , introduced in the 70 by aguilar , baslev and combes @xcite ( for a review see also ref .  ) , resonances are identified with the complex eigenvalues of a non - symmetric linear operator obtained from the original one by analytic complex deformation . the real part of such complex - valued eigenvalues coincides with the usual resonance energy level , while the imaginary part is associated with the resonant state lifetime . the complex scaling method has been employed in ref .   to twisted qw in order to prove the existence of resonances and here we briefly resume it .",
