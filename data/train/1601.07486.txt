    "the phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory is , up to now , widely used for describing new superconductors . using the original gorkov method a microscopic derivation of gl equations of superconductors with anisotropic order parameter",
    "was done  @xcite .",
    "generalization of the gorkov method on the strongly correlated hubbard model and emery model in the atomic representation has been provided in  @xcite .",
    "microscopic gl equations have been also obtained for the t - j model in the slave - boson approach  @xcite .    in the last time a considerable interest is caused by a generalization of the gl theory for the materials in which at the same conditions the cooper instability and long - range magnetic order are induced leading to a transition in the coexistence phase of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism ( sc+afm ) . for u - based ferromagnetic superconductors with triplet pairings the gl equations have been derived in  @xcite . the microscopic gl expansion in the sc+afm phase for the hubbard model and t - j model in the mean - field approximation has also been given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "at present ce - based intermetallic compounds with heavy fermions ( for example , cein@xmath0 , cerhin@xmath1 , cept@xmath2in@xmath3 @xcite ) are widely known in which a transition to the homogeneous sc+afm phase is implemented at low temperatures and under pressure . in this work in the framework of the effective periodic anderson model describing in  @xcite the microscopic derivation of the gl equations for such superconductors will be carried out .",
    "the hamiltonian of the periodic anderson model , with the exchange interaction between localized electrons as the main mechanism of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , has a form : @xmath4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the annihilation and creation fermi operators of an itinerant electron for the wannier site @xmath7 and the projection of the spin @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the site energy of an itinerant electron with respect to the chemical potential  @xmath10 , @xmath11 is hopping parameter between sites @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the hubbard operator related to the site @xmath7 , which is constructed using the atomic states @xmath14 and @xmath15 as usual , @xmath16 is the bare energy of a localized electron counted from @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath17 is the quasispin vector operator of a localized electron , whose components are related to the hubbard operators by the standard way , @xmath18 is the number operator of localized electrons , @xmath19 is the effective exchange constant of quasilocalized electrons on sites  @xmath7  and  @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath20 is the matrix element that describes the hybridization of the localized and itinerant states related to the same wannier site ( @xmath21 ) or to different sites ( @xmath22 ) .    to describe antiferromagnetism",
    "a two - sublattice description is used .",
    "therefore in the sc+afm phase two normal and two anomalous matsubara green s functions  @xcite for quasilocalized electrons are introduced : @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 , sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 belong to different sublattices , @xmath28 denotes opposite projection of spin @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noted that the energy of localized electron is renormalized by the antiferromagnetic exchange field .",
    "so the energy in the f - sublattice is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 if @xmath34 .",
    "following gorkov s method the equations of motion for the thermodynamic green s functions have been simplified using the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "to derive the equations of motion on the mean - field level the zwanzig - mori projection - operator formalism has been used .",
    "using the relations between the green s functions for itinerant electrons and localized green s functions the gorkov equations for the fourier transforms in the sc+afm phase have been obtained : @xmath35 the equations for the @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be obtained from the presented ones by substitution @xmath38 , and vice versa . in equations  ,",
    "it has been taken into account that @xmath39 does not depend on spin . here",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 is a matsubara frequency for fermions , @xmath42 is a hubbard renormalization . superconducting order parameter @xmath43",
    "is given by integral equation : @xmath44 in what follows the first - nearest - neighbor approximation for the exchange interaction is used .",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath39 are related to green s function of the background state : a nel antiferromagnetic state if @xmath46 , a paramagnetic state if @xmath47 , and satisfied the following equations : @xmath48 for simplicity we take into account only intra - sublattice hybridization  @xmath49 , then @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 describe intra - sublattice and inter - sublattice hoppings in k - space .",
    "we limit ourself by the consideration of only d - wave superconductivity as leading pairing symmetry .",
    "then in the absence of the external magnetic field gl equations in the wannier representation have a simple form : @xmath54 \\delta_f = 0 , \\\\",

    "can be obtained after taking a continuum limit for slowly varying @xmath64 , @xmath55 .",
    "the difference between the gl coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 is connected with the fact that cooper instability does nt change much the antiferromagnetic order parameter in the sc+afm phase as it has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "otherwise the antiferromagnetic ordering has a particularly strong influence on the superconducting order parameter .",
    "therefore the term with  @xmath66 in equation  ( [ gl_eq_2 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "it should be noted that equations  ( [ gl_eq_1 ] ) , ( [ gl_eq_2 ] ) for non - zero @xmath67 are valid only near a critical temperature @xmath68 of the sc+afm phase .",
