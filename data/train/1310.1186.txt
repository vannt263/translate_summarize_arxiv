    "for last 20 years , grs 1915 + 105 is the only galactic micro@xmath0quasar showing prolific and complex x - ray intensity morphology .",
    "dramatic fall and rise in the luminosity by an order of magnitude in couple of seconds and repetition of such few hundred second fluctuations in cyclic manner over time - scales ranging from few thousands of seconds to few days , makes grs 1915 + 105 unique with respect to other micro - quasars .",
    "these drops are most prominent in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 classes and they are simultaneous with spectral hardening by a couple of factors @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to model the spectra of such fluctuations by assuming that the energy spectra at the base / persistent flux level of the fluctuation are consistent with the low hard state ( l@xmath6/l@xmath7 @xmath8 0.05@xmath00.2 ) while energy spectra at the peak flux level are consistent with the high soft ( hs ) state ( l@xmath6/l@xmath7 @xmath8 0.7@xmath01.2 ) in grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "the energy spectra at the peak flux level and persistent flux level have been modelled with the disc blackbody ( with and without zero - torque conditions ) and powerlaw ( with and without cut - off)/low temperature comptonization @xcite or thermal comptonization of disc blackbody photons along with the presence of a strong non - thermal component / powerlaw tail using _",

    "rxte_/hexte @xcite simultaneously with _ osse_/_cgro _",
    "observations @xcite , _ suzaku _ observations @xcite , _ bepposax _ observations @xcite and _ integral _ observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite observe that although hs state spectra are dominated by soft thermal emission , it is complex in nature and can not be described by a standard thermal disc . in summary ,",
    "the spectra of grs 1915 + 105 are complex at different flux levels and there exists a large degeneracy in multi - component spectral fitting .    in a standard",
    "_ steady state _ accretion disc ,",
    "the effective temperature varies with radii as @xmath9 giving rise to the characteristic low energy spectral index of @xmath10 .",
    "a generalization of this model is when the temperature index is allowed to be a free parameter namely the p - free disc model where @xmath11 . in xspec , this model has been incorporated as diskpbb @xcite .",
    "there are several possible reasons why the temperature will deviate from being @xmath12 . at near eddington luminosity",
    "( l / l @xmath13 ) , the disc is geometrically thicker than the standard one and there is an additional cooling mechanism due to advection of energy in the radial direction . @xcite .",
    "the spectra from such slim accretion discs can be well approximated as _ p_@xmath0free disc spectra with @xmath14 . even for lower accretion rate systems ,",
    "the spectra may deviate from the standard one .",
    "in general , for optically thick accretion discs , the local effective temperature gets diluted by a colour factor @xmath15 due to radiative transfer effects .",
    "although numerical computations suggest that the colour factor is nearly independent of radius with @xmath16 @xcite , this may not always be the case , especially if there is a comptonizing medium on top of the disc .",
    "if @xmath17 has a radial dependence , then the observed colour temperature will have a different radial dependence than the standard case .",
    "another possibility , particularly relevant to grs 1915 + 105 , is that for a non - steady state disc , the accretion rate may not be constant at different radii , resulting in a deviation of the temperature profile .",
    "thus the _ p_@xmath0free disc model seems to be a reasonable empirical model to test if it can describe the thermal spectral component of different complex spectra of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the complex spectra make it difficult to understand the nature of large amplitude oscillations observed in this source .",
    "the disappearance of a thermal component ( thought to be associated with the inner disc ) and the associated jet activities is considered evidence for a phenomenological picture @xcite which consists of ` disc evacuation ' , jet creation and subsequent refilling of the disc in a repetitive manner @xcite .",
    "the system is more complex with the soft dips during the @xmath3 class which are interpreted as the ejection of the comptonized cloud with the disc blackbody and power@xmath0law being present @xcite .",
    "however , from fundamental accretion disc theory , the prime candidate for the cause of the large amplitude variation seen in grs 1915 + 105 is the radiation pressure instability . in the standard accretion disc theory @xcite ,",
    "the disc is both secularly and thermally unstable when it is radiation pressure dominated @xcite . since the inner region of the disc is radiation pressure dominated at accretion rates larger than 5% of the eddington value , the standard accretion disc should be unstable and sources should show large amplitude oscillations .",
    "it has been a puzzle why typical galactic x - ray binaries , despite showing high luminosities and thermal spectra from a standard accretion disc , do not show large amplitude variation and seems not to be subjected to this instability .",
    "this could be because the viscosity prescription is different than that assumed in the standard theory @xcite or that stochastic viscous variations stabilize the disc @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding that other typical black hole systems do not show large variations , it is attractive to conclude that the radiation pressure instability does occur for grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there are several difficulties or issues regarding this interpretation .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 shows various types of variability patterns which seem to be governed by non - linear equations @xcite and there maybe more than one mechanism responsible for the complex behaviour .",
    "more importantly , some numerical simulations of an unstable radiation pressure dominated standard disc show different behaviour than what is seen from data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that the amplitude of the oscillation in simulations are at least two orders of magnitude as compared to a factor of 4@xmath010 that is observed @xcite . secondly",
    ", their simulations show spike like behaviour where the source is in a high luminosity level for a short duration ( @xmath8 2% of total cycle time ) followed by a longer spell in the low state . the spike like behaviour",
    "is observed during the @xmath5 class activity in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "however , @xmath1 and @xmath2 classes are also observed frequently where the time spent by the source in peak luminosity is roughly equal to the time spent in dip luminosity . to address both these issues , assumptions of the standard accretion disc theory",
    "needs to be modified .",
    "observed order of magnitude change in luminosity as well as @xmath1/@xmath2 class like light curves are successfully reproduced in a numerical simulation by @xcite .",
    "they modified the viscosity prescription by changing the standard assumption that the viscous stress scales with the total pressure and allow for a fraction of the energy to be dissipated in the corona above and a jet carrying a luminosity - dependent fraction of energy , to qualitatively explain the observations .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite show that only the latter maybe sufficient .",
    "more recently @xcite have studied the phase resolved spectra of the ` heartbeat ' oscillation and show it to be consistent with the radiation pressure instability .",
    "while a qualitative picture arises by these investigations , a complete spectral evolution understanding of different oscillations is still not clear .",
    "importantly , a model independent fundamental question regarding the oscillations remains unexamined",
    "i.e. , whether the change in flux is due to the appearance of an additional spectral component or does the total spectral shape evolve from the low to the high state ?",
    "the question can be put in better context when one notes that in other typical black hole systems , the prominent spectral states @xmath0 ` hard ' and ` soft ' have completely different spectral shapes and temporal properties .",
    "one can not explain the difference between the two as an addition or subtraction of a spectral component .",
    "however , for the oscillation of grs 1915 + 105 , it is not clear whether the change in spectral shape and flux is due to an addition of a component or not .",
    "if indeed the oscillation is due to an additional component appearing and disappearing , its flux variation could be much larger than than the factor of 10 difference between the peak and dip levels . in the framework of the radiation pressure instability model",
    ", this could mean that the accretion disc flux variation may indeed be several orders of magnitude as seen in numerical simulations .    a recent outburst ( 2011 ) in another transient black hole x - ray binary ( bhxb )",
    "igr j17091@xmath03624 shows regular , repetitive , large amplitude oscillations in its x - ray light curve , similar to the @xmath5 cycles observed in grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "the outburst was first observed by the _ ibis _",
    "detector on - board _ integral _ satellite in the 15.0@xmath0120.0 kev energy range @xcite . using detailed timing and spectral analysis , @xcite",
    "show that prior to the @xmath5 class activity in igr j17091@xmath03624 , the source passes through the hard / soft intermediate state which is also observed in grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that these oscillations are spectrally harder than grs 1915 + 105 by a factor of 2 . using x - ray morphology and hardness , few more types of variabilities",
    "have been found @xcite , some of which are similar to grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "hence igr j17091@xmath03624 provides us a unique opportunity to test models and hypothesis which are used to explain the large amplitude , quasi - periodic x - ray oscillations in grs 1915 + 105 .    in this work",
    ", we examine the flux resolved spectroscopy of large amplitude oscillations in grs 19115 + 105 and in the new source igr j17091@xmath03624 .",
    "one of our motivation is to test the p - free disc model and to see if it empirically describes the thermal spectral component better than the standard disc one .",
    "our primary aim is to investigate whether the oscillations observed in the two sources can be described by the appearance and disappearance of a single spectral component .",
    "we will do so by assuming that the spectrum at the dip of the oscillation is persistent and we will subtract it from the spectrum at the peak by treating it as the background spectra of the peak spectra in the xspec .",
    "we will test if such a ` difference ' spectrum can be fitted by a simple single component .",
    "we also justify the difference spectral fitting method by another method in which we jointly fit peak and dip spectrum using a steady emission which is tied for both and a variable component which is free to vary .",
    "section 2 and its subsections provide details of the observations and analysis procedure .",
    "we discuss results in section 3 , while in section 4 we summarize the results and discuss their implications .",
    "in order to search observations which show large amplitude , quasi - regular x - ray variations similar to the @xmath1/@xmath2 class , we analyse all data as observed by the _ rxte_/pca between 1996 and 1999 .",
    "we assume that results obtained from observations of these three years are valid for all similar observation in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "to create difference spectra using flux resolved spectroscopy technique , we set two data selection criteria @xmath0 ( i ) time interval of any subsequent peak or dip of an oscillation must be greater than few multiples of 16 s in case of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "the reason is full energy channel information ( 2.0@xmath060.0 kev ) is available only for standard2 data in grs 1915 + 105 which has 16 sec .",
    "time resolution .",
    "we adopt different criteria for observations in igr j17091@xmath03624 .",
    "we consider here goodxenon data file which provide channel - energy information covering entire _",
    "rxte_/pca energy range with the time resolution of 10 @xmath18s .",
    "since time - scale of quasi regular and large amplitude oscillations in igr j17091@xmath03624 is moderately smaller ( @xmath8 10@xmath0 20 times ) than those observed in @xmath1 and @xmath2 classes in grs 1915 + 105 , we use 0.25 s bintime to create peak and dip spectra , separately .",
    "we find that other choices of bin - size in extracting spectra results in poor signal - to - noise ratio due to low count rate and faster oscillation period . in order to improve the signal@xmath0to@xmath0noise ratio quality further ,",
    "we merge several peak and dip intervals to carry out further analysis . in igr ji7091@xmath03624 ,",
    "the @xmath5 class activities are frequently observed with higher frequency than grs 1915 + 105 . for both sources",
    ", we do not use @xmath5 class observations in this work as its oscillation frequency is very high .",
    "due to high frequency , changes in spectral parameters are very fast and the source spends few seconds at the peak flux level ( @xmath8 1/10 of dip time interval ) .",
    "hence activities of both sources during the @xmath5 class do not fulfil our selection criteria .",
    "we consider observations which show light curves similar to the @xmath1/@xmath2 class in grs 1915 + 105 , where the dip time intervals are roughly similar to the following peak time intervals .",
    "( ii ) the light curve should contain sufficiently large number of such oscillations so that several peak time intervals as well as dip time intervals can be merged to obtain sufficiently high signal@xmath0to@xmath0noise ratio for further analysis .    out of the selected three years observation of the _ rxte_/pca",
    ", we find 17 observations in grs 1915 + 105 which fulfil our selection criteria .",
    "we also exclude @xmath19 and @xmath20 class observations from our analysis as they lack stable peak flux level .",
    "the details of the selected 17 observations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 classes are provided in the table 1 .",
    "using 1 s bin@xmath0time , we extract light curve of each observation in the energy range 2.0@xmath060.0 kev . for each quasi - regular oscillation",
    ", we define the dip time interval and peak time interval as time intervals of the persistent flux level / low stable flux level and peak flux level / high stable flux level between sharp rise and sharp fall respectively . to select peak and dip intervals , we consider both x - ray intensity profile and hardness ratio profile .",
    "we observe that within consecutive burst - to - dip and dip - to - burst transitions in the x - ray intensity profile , both peak and dip intervals are clearly demarcated by sharp changes in the time - dependent hardness ratio profile .",
    "using this characteristic as the peak and dip selection criteria , we approximately set threshold values in x - ray intensity to choose both peak and dip intervals which are consistent with the sharp change in the hardness ratio .",
    "such selections are shown by green and red colours in all panels of figure 1 and threshold values are shown by horizontal dotted lines in top four panels of figure 1 .",
    "we follow the similar criteria for selecting peak and dip intervals in igr j17091@xmath03624 .",
    "we produce the hardness intensity diagram ( hid ) and the colour@xmath0colour diagram ( cd ) using binned light curves in different energy bands .",
    "hard colour is defined as the ratio of the background subtracted count rate between 12.0@xmath060.0 kev and 2.0@xmath05.0 kev and soft colour is defined as the ratio of the background subtracted count rate between 5.0@xmath012.0 kev and 2.0@xmath05.0 kev . to study characteristics of the source during peak flux level and persistent flux level , we separately produce unfolded rms normalized power density spectra ( pds ; in the unit of rms@xmath21 ) in the 0.01@xmath010.0 hz frequency range .",
    "we use 1/64 s bin@xmath0time so that the nyquist frequency would be 32 hz .",
    "we extract energy spectra and background spectra for peak flux level and persistent flux level using standard2 data file with 16 s time resolution .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     top@xmath0left , top@xmath0right , bottom@xmath0left and bottom@xmath0right panels of figure 2 show the squared rms variability in the energy range 2.0@xmath04.7 kev , 4.8@xmath06.4 kev , 6.5@xmath08.6 kev and 8.7@xmath010.9 kev respectively during both peak and dip intervals .",
    "these variabilities at all fourier frequencies ( 0.01@xmath010 hz ) , show that the rms power during peak flux level is always higher than the rms power of persistent flux level .",
    "even the shape of the variability during both intervals do not match with each other .",
    "this is an important observation from the variability analysis which support the idea that at all energy range , peak and dip spectra may be differed by the appearance and disappearance of an extra spectral component .",
    "similar results and spectral parameters from both difference spectral parameter method and the joint spectra with a variable component ( jsvc ) method confirm that an additional component is indeed appeared during peak intervals .",
    "there are at least two more evidence that the additional component is more consistent with a _",
    "p_@xmath0free disc blackbody rather than a standard disc blackbody @xmath0 ( 1 ) the reduced @xmath22 averaged over all observations for @xmath23 model is significantly better than the reduced @xmath22 averaged over all observations for @xmath24 model .",
    "f_@xmath0test yields the significance of 6.4@xmath25 . again , from the jsvc method , it can also be noted that the choice of diskpbb model over diskbb model as a variable component is significant @xmath26 5@xmath25 . ( 2 ) from the table 2 , it can be noted that for all observations , the ` _ p _ ' values during peak spectral fitting are significantly lower ( at least 3@xmath25 ) than the ` _ p _ ' values during dip spectral fitting .",
    "this indicate that the spectral modelling during peak intervals prefers slim disc approximations rather than standard disc prescriptions .",
    "top@xmath0left and top@xmath0right panel of figure 3 show the peak and dip spectra of grs 1915 + 105 , fitted with the diskpbb+nthcomp+ga model respectively .",
    "fitted model components and residuals are also shown .",
    "it may be noted that at energies less than 15 kev , the contribution of the diskpbb model flux to the total flux decreases while moving from the peak spectral fitting ( top left panel ) to the dip spectral fitting ( top right panel ) . in all cases ,",
    "the flux due to the gaussian model is always @xmath27 1% of the total flux .",
    "difference spectra from both grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091@xmath03624 , fitted with the diskpbb model are shown in the middle left and middle right panel of figure 3 along with their residuals .",
    "bottom left panel of figure 3 shows joint spectral fitting of the peak ( shown by @xmath28 ) and dip ( shown by stars ) spectra with the diskpbb+nthcomp model ( tied ) plus the diskpbb model as a variable component ( shown by circles ) .",
    "we may add here that during @xmath1/@xmath2 classes , a soft spectral component seems to appear during peak flux on the top of the hard persistent flux .",
    "however , during @xmath3 class , the behavior is opposite .",
    "the peak flux level is spectrally harder by a couple of factors than the persistent flux level , i.e. , soft dips are observed . in this class , average count rate during short , soft dip intervals",
    "is @xmath8 1749.32 cts@xmath0s@xmath29/pcu whereas average count rate during long , hard intervals is 4246.85 cts@xmath0s@xmath29/pcu ( as observed on 05 september , 1997 ( obs i d @xmath0 : 20402 - 01 - 45 - 02 ) ) .",
    "difference spectra are created by using the long , hard interval spectra as the source spectra in the xspec v12.7.1 and the soft , dip interval spectra as its background spectra .",
    "although @xcite numerically reproduced the light curve of the @xmath3 class , we find that the difference spectra in the @xmath3 class is much more complex than the difference spectra in @xmath1/@xmath2 classes and can not be described by a single component model like diskpbb or nthcomp along with the ga at 6.4 kev .",
    "( reduced @xmath22 is greater than 5 for both models ) .",
    "difference spectra due to the @xmath3 class fitted with diskpbb+ga model is shown in bottom right panel of figure 3 .",
    "hence the spectral behaviour during excess emission in the @xmath3 class is complex and is not reflected in the light curve .    to check whether fitted parameters of difference spectra matches with simulated diskpbb spectral parameters from earlier works @xcite , we plot ` _ p _ ' parameter values ( left panel of figure 4 ) and apparent inner disc radius ( right panel of figure 4 ) as a function of the bolometric eddington ratio .",
    "both plots show the decrease in ` _ p _ ' parameter and apparent inner disc radius with the increase in bolometric eddington ratio with the significance of 6.8@xmath25 and 3.4@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the observed trend in both plots agrees qualitatively ( although not quantitatively ) with the trend from numerical predictions from @xcite .",
    "using flux resolved spectroscopy , we show that during large amplitude , x - ray intensity variations in grs 1915 + 105 , the peak and the dip spectra of the source are complex and multi - components .",
    "after checking with results from several multi - component model fitting , we show that a combination of _ p_@xmath0free disc model along - with a comptonization model is more consistent ( @xmath26 6@xmath25 significance using f - test ) with the data than a standard disc model and comptonization . more importantly , applying both difference spectral method ( where the difference spectra are constructed by treating peak spectra as the source spectra in xspec and the dip spectra as its background spectra ) and joint spectra with a variable component fitting method on several large amplitude oscillations from grs 1915 + 105 , we find that for all observations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 classes , the difference spectra is remarkably simple and is consistent with being a single _ p_@xmath0 free disc emission",
    ". however , this may not hold true for complex variabilities where soft dips are observed ( like @xmath3 class ) .",
    "we show that this is also the case for igr j17091@xmath03624 .",
    "it may be noted that our analysis and interpretation of results are based on spectral modelling of the _ rxte_/pca data .",
    "although we put best efforts to bring out a physical model consistent with the data by eliminating possibilities of model degeneracies , it would be interesting to check the validity of our results using broad - band spectroscopy with _",
    "swift_/xrt and _ suzaku_. these active missions can provide spectra with larger energy range than _",
    "rxte_.    in this work , our results answer a primary question regarding the nature of the large amplitude variations seen in these sources . the variations",
    "could be associated with dramatic spectral changes , as seen when typical galactic black holes make transitions from hard to soft states or they could be due to quasi@xmath0periodic appearance and disappearance of a spectral component . for the data analysed here , we find that the latter is a more consistent explanation .",
    "the absolute rms variability represents the intrinsic variability of any light curve . in order to have an extra@xmath0component ,",
    "it is necessary ( but not sufficient ) to have excess power ( may be small ) at any energy and at any fourier frequency of the absolute rms spectrum . if at any energy and at any fourier frequency , the absolute rms of the pds of the dip intervals was to exceed the absolute rms of the pds of the peak interval , then the idea of an additional component would have to be abandoned .",
    "we verify that this is not so by noting that in four different energy bands , the short term rms variability of peak intervals is always higher than the dip intervals at different time - scales ( 0.01@xmath010.0 hz ) and their shapes are significantly different from each other .",
    "it may be noted that the absolute rms could indicate a new component with more variability , but it could also indicate the brightening of a component with steady fractional variability .",
    "thus , rms spectra analysis does not prove our interpretation but it is merely used for the consistency check only .",
    "specifically the variable component can be described as a _",
    "p_@xmath0free disc emission which could arise if the standard disc is super@xmath0eddington , or if the colour factor varies with radii or if the disc is not steady . using numerical simulations , @xcite show that the deviation from the standard accretion disc ( i.e. t@xmath30 @xmath31 r@xmath32 ) to the optically thick slim disc ( i.e. t@xmath30 @xmath31 r@xmath33 ) becomes significant when the source accretes matter at eddington or super@xmath0eddington limit ( see bottom panel of figure 5 in @xcite ) . comparing table 5 and figure 4 from our analysis with figure 5 in @xcite",

    ", using both high ( @xmath36 class ) and low luminosity ( @xmath37 class ) observations from grs 1915 + 105 , @xcite showed that for the spin parameter value of 0.99 , the disc luminosity prefers a flatter temperature gradient than that in the standard disc when the luminosity is above @xmath8 0.2l@xmath7 ( see figure 11 ) .",
    "later , in an extensive study , @xcite derive equations governing the time evolution of fully relativistic slim accretion discs in the kerr metric and numerically construct their detailed non@xmath0stationary models . using these models , they also predicted that the disc luminosity of a moderately rotating black hole , deviates from the standard disc assumption at @xmath80.2l@xmath7 or above .",
    "we are considering here the bolometric luminosity due to difference spectrum which is basically the change in luminosity when the source evolves from the persistent flux level to the peak flux level .",
    "the peak level luminosity may reach 0.6@xmath00.8 l@xmath7 .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then the slim disc may be able to describe the accretion disc during large amplitude x - ray variations observed during @xmath1 or @xmath2 class in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091@xmath03624 .",
    "our results are consistent with the general idea that the variability is due to an unstable radiation pressure dominated disc",
    ". such discs should show high amplitude oscillations where the difference between the peak and dip flux may be more than an order of magnitude .",
    "if there is an additional persistent source in the system , the oscillations will be observed as an appearance and disappearance of a disc like emission over the persistent level and we show that this is precisely what is observed . although @xcite numerically reproduce oscillations with equal time in peaks and dips using disc - corona coupled system , it would be interesting to see whether detailed simulations of the radiation pressure dominated discs could reproduce such oscillations .",
    "the model requires a persistent flux which itself maybe described as some soft thermal disc emission and a hard comptonized emission .",
    "the origin of this is rather unclear .",
    "it is unlikely that its origin could be the outer disc ( r @xmath26 300r@xmath38 ) as the dynamical structure associated with the outer disc can not be changed on the limit - cycle time - scale which is much shorter than the viscous time@xmath0scale of the outer disc .",
    "again , the luminosity of persistent intervals is too high ( @xmath8 5% of l@xmath39 ) to come from the outer disc .",
    "@xcite showed that evolution of the inner disc geometry which is in accordance with the theoretical interpretations of slim disc approximations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite , may be related to the dramatic drop in luminosity during large amplitude oscillations .",
    "this interpretation is supported by our results from the spectral analysis using both methods .",
    "detail simulations of the radiation pressure dominated disc are required to see whether the outer gas pressure dominated disc as well as jet activity can be reconciled with the origin of the persistent emission .",
    "spectral results show that the diskpbb model provides low inner disc radius and high disc temperature .",
    "this is highly consistent with the black hole properties of grs 1915 + 105 . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "there are two possible explanations of apparently low inner disc radius and high disc temperature in grs 1915 + 105 @xmath0 ( 1 ) the presence of a highly rotating kerr black hole in grs 1915 + 105 @xcite with the spin parameter of @xmath8 0.7 - 0.98 @xcite .",
    "the dragging of last stable orbit inward is an obvious consequence of such high spin which in turn increases the inner disc temperature and decreases the inner disc radius .",
    "this fact agrees well with our values of r@xmath30 and inner disc temperature . ( 2 ) due to large inclination of grs 1915 + 105 ( @xmath870@xmath40 ) , the outer part of the optically thick disc can effectively block the radiation from the inner part which effectively reduce the value of r@xmath30 .",
    "the other bhxb igr j17091@xmath03624 shows lower average disc temperature than grs 1915 + 105 and marginally low _",

    "although the unabsorbed bolometric flux is @xmath8 20@xmath050 times lesser than that of grs 1915 + 105 , our results show that the large amplitude x - ray variations observed in igr j17091@xmath03624 are also consistent with the slim disc approximations . comparing results from both sources from this work and earlier works @xcite , it may be possible that the nature of the binary companion in both sources is same and x - ray activities in these sources are related by a scaling of the central black hole mass .",
    "however , this indeed need to be investigated further . since mass , distance ( but a tentative measurement of large distance has been reported in igr j17091@xmath03624 by @xcite ) and spin parameters are unknown in igr j17091@xmath03624 , further prediction of black hole characteristics in igr j17091@xmath03624 is presently out of scope .",

    "<S> using the flux resolved spectroscopy for the first time , we analyse the _ rxte_/pca data of the black hole x - ray binaries grs 1915 + 105 and igr j17091@xmath03624 , when both sources show large amplitude , quasi - regular oscillations in 2.0@xmath060.0 kev x - ray light curves ( similar to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 classes in grs 1915 + 105 ) . for different observations , we extract spectra during the peak ( spectrally soft ) and dip ( spectrally hard ) intervals of the oscillation , and find that their spectra are phenomenologically complex , requiring at least two distinct spectral components . besides a thermal comptonization component , we find that the disc emission is better modelled by an index - free multicolour disc blackbody component ( _ p_@xmath0free disc model ) rather than that from a standard accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> while the peak and dip spectra are complex , remarkably , their difference spectra constructed by treating dip spectra as the background spectra of the peak spectra , can be modelled as a single _ p_@xmath0free disc component . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the variability at different time - scales and energy bands of the peak flux level is always greater than or equal to the variability of the dip flux level , which strengthens the possibility that the peak flux level may be due to an independent spectral component added to the dip one . using joint spectral analysis of peak and dip spectra with a variable emission component , we verify that the variable component is consistent with _ p_@xmath0free disc blackbody and its spectral parameters are similar to that found from the difference spectral analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we show that for oscillations in the @xmath3 class where soft dips are observed , the difference spectra can not be similarly fitted . </S>",
    "<S> our result substantiates the standard hypothesis that the oscillations are due to the limit cycle behaviour of an unstable radiation pressure dominated inner disc . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this interpretation , the flux variation of the unstable disc can be several order of magnitudes as expected from some theoretical simulations and need not be fine tuned to match the factor of @xmath4 variation seen between the peak and dip levels .    </S>",
