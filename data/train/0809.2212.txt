    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in the manganites @xmath0mno@xmath1 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are trivalent rare - earth and divalent alkaline - earth ions , respectively ) has attracted much interest to these perovskites @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "understanding the origin of the cmr effect from a fundamental point of view is expected to give some insight into the complex behaviour seen in other strongly correlated systems , as high - temperature superconductors . on the other",
    ", such a colossal response to an external perturbation still makes these mn oxides very appealing from the point of view of applications @xcite .",
    "this cmr effect , particularly `` colossal '' in the so - called intermediate - bandwidth manganites for doping @xmath7 @xcite , is intrinsically related with the presence of metallic behaviour below the curie temperature ( @xmath8 ) and insulating behaviour above it .",
    "understanding the nature of this metal - insulator transition ( mit ) accompanying the magnetic transition is thus a key point in the comprehension of the cmr effect .",
    "qualitatively , the correlation between transport and magnetic properties is well understood via zener s double - exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite : the spin of itinerant @xmath9 and local @xmath10 mn _ d _ electrons are aligned by hund s rule ; to lower the kinetic energy ferromagnetism is favoured , and at low temperature ( @xmath11 ) a ferromagnetic half - metal is realised @xcite .",
    "consequently , early proposals for the mit focused on the random nature of hopping in the paramagnetic phase ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "quantitative analysis based on the transfer matrix method showed concomitant ferro - paramagnetic and mits for @xmath7 when diagonal disorder is added to the de model @xcite .",
    "the resultant cmr effect @xcite , however , requires an amount of diagonal disorder that seems incompatible with potential fluctuations originated by the random distribution of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ions @xcite .",
    "this apparent failure of anderson localisation theories favoured models based on polaronic formation @xcite , owing to the electron - phonon coupling due to jahn - teller effect in manganites @xcite .",
    "it has been argued , however , that manganites fall into an intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime where small - polarons ",
    "key ingredients for a mit driven by electron - phonon interaction  are hardly formed in the paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "more recent theories explain the cmr as an effect of competing orders : in brief , a ferromagnetic metal competes with a charge - order insulator phase , producing , for @xmath15 , an inhomogeneous state highly sensitive to external perturbations where cmr is observed @xcite .",
    "the underlying model producing such a phase competition scenario takes into account , on the same footing , the de mechanism and the electron - lattice coupling and , surprisingly , intrinsic disorder in manganites . adding quenched disorder has been shown to make the inhomogeneous state even more sensitive to external perturbations , enhancing the cmr effect , and avoiding fine tuning of model parameters @xcite",
    "however , the need to include disorder on the same level as the de mechanism and coupling to jahn - teller phonons strongly contradicts the observation that disorder in manganites is sufficiently weak for a virtual crystal approximation to be reasonable @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a realistic model for diagonal ( substitutional ) disorder in manganites , in addition to the de hopping disorder , and investigate the mit as a function of temperature , across the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic line , and as a function of doping  @xmath6 .",
    "contrary to previous results @xcite , we find that values of parameters , estimated from the electronic structure of manganites @xcite , are not incompatible with the possibility of a disorder induced mit accompanying the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition at intermediate doping ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , substitutional disorder has to be considered at least on the same foot as the coupling to the lattice when addressing the cmr properties of manganites .",
    "these findings give support to theories where disorder is a key ingredient @xcite , as the phase - competition scenario for cmr , where , as mentioned above , diagonal disorder plays a crucial role @xcite .",
    "in order to model substitutional disorder in manganites we note that , for each carrier introduced in the system , there is a @xmath16 substitution . the corresponding change in the coulomb field shifts the site energy of an electron in a manganese site at a distance @xmath17 by@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relative dielectric constant of the material .",
    "we can take this effect into account by including a random site energy term in the de hamiltonian,@xmath20 the first term on the right hand side in  ( [ eq : hdedis ] ) is the usual infinite hund coupling de hamiltonian , where the hopping of @xmath9 electrons between nearest - neighbours mn sites depends on the background configuration of classical @xmath10 core spins @xmath21 , with @xmath22.\\label{eq : tsisj}\\ ] ]    the second term on the right hand side of  ( [ eq : hdedis ] ) stands for the diagonal site disorder .",
    "it has been modelled in previous works with a uniform probability distribution for @xmath23 ( anderson disorder ) @xcite . through",
    "the analysis of the mobility edge trajectory in the energy vs disorder ( @xmath24 ) plane , obtained using the transfer matrix method @xcite , it has been found that a mit occurs when the system crosses the ferro - paramagnetic transition line , for @xmath25 provided the diagonal disorder is strong enough , @xmath26 .",
    "the plausibility of such large value of the disorder parameter , however , has been questioned @xcite mainly on the basis of density functional results obtained by pickett and singh @xcite . in the following",
    "we show that a thorough analysis of the results of @xcite and @xcite are , in fact , not incompatible with disorder in the range @xmath26 .",
    "pickett and singh @xcite looked at the @xmath27 concentration , and performed lda calculations of band structure for a periodic structure of @xmath28 with a tetragonal unit cell containing a la  ca ",
    "la set of planes .",
    "there are two inequivalent mn sites in this structure , one with eight @xmath29 and the other with four @xmath30 and four @xmath29 nearest - neighbours ( nns ) .",
    "the local density of states at the mn sites showed a difference of @xmath31 between the band edges for these two types of sites , which was interpreted as arising from the different charges @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 with @xmath33 given by ( [ eq : vmang ] ) with @xmath34 ( the first nn @xmath35 distance ) , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38 distance @xcite",
    ". from the calculated value of @xmath39 a dielectric constant @xmath40 is obtained , or equivalently @xmath41 ( @xmath42 was used @xcite ) .",
    "such a dielectric constant , however , is quite unlikely .",
    "we should note that equation  ( [ eq : v1mang ] ) is actually a microscopic description , where @xmath43 . neglecting metallic screening",
    ", we should get a relative permittivity reflecting the polarizability of the @xmath44 complex , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "infrared reflectivity measurements on la@xmath45ca@xmath46mno@xmath1 give a high - frequency dielectric constant @xmath47 at @xmath48 @xcite , which , though being only a lower bound , casts serious doubts on @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , note that the result @xmath32 is a special case where only first nns ( la / ca sites ) contribute to the local potential .",
    "a more realistic situation should account for next nns contributions .",
    "it is easy to generalise the first nn result @xmath32 in order to account for the coulomb contribution of the the @xmath49 shell , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the dielectric constant for the given shell . in particular , taking into account second and third nns , we get @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is absent because the two inequivalent mn sites have the same second nn environment .",
    "the value @xmath31 found by pickett and singh @xcite is reproduced with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where we used @xmath56 .",
    "following @xcite , we will keep only first and second nn contributions , with @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting random site energies may be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of @xmath14 ions in the @xmath61th shell of mn site  @xmath62 for a given @xmath63 configuration .",
    "inserting @xmath54 in equation  ( [ eq : v1mang ] ) we get @xmath64 .",
    "the probability distribution for this random , but correlated site energy model may be written as@xmath65.\\label{eq : pecorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure  [ fig : dist2nn ] we show the resulting coarse grained distribution as a function of @xmath66 for @xmath27 , where the average site energy is @xmath67 ; the inset shows the true discrete mn - site energy probability , as given by the weight of the delta functions in ( [ eq : pecorr ] ) .",
    "the distribution is approximately gaussian with a root mean square ( rms ) deviation@xmath68 as obtained by fitting with a gaussian distribution ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : dist2nn ] ) .",
    "a rectangular distribution with the same rms deviation has @xmath69 ; well in the range required for a mit at @xmath70 , @xmath26 @xcite . the effect on @xmath70 of a discrete random site - energy distribution similar to equation  ( [ eq : pecorr ] ) , but restricted to the nn shell , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "full line shows the probability distribution of mn - site energies due to random placement of @xmath4 ( @xmath71 probability ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath72 probability ) on first and second neighbour sites , obtained by substituting @xmath73functions in ( [ eq : pecorr ] ) by lorentzians with half width @xmath74 at half maximum .",
    "a dielectric constant of @xmath75 was used for both shells .",
    "the dashed line is the fit to the full line with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the inset shows the true discrete mn - site energy probability . ]",
    "the analysis which lead us to figure  [ fig : dist2nn ] and equation  ( [ eq : rms ] ) was previously carried out in @xcite , but with a very different conclusion about the strength of disorder in cmr manganites .",
    "the main difference with respect to the present analysis is the value of the dielectric constant entering equation  ( [ eq : pecorr ] ) through @xmath33 sites in @xcite .",
    "the distances to the first and to the second shells differ by 48% , and not by the referred 13% in @xcite .",
    "this error , however , does not change considerably the results : while in the case of 48% difference the second shell has 24 sites , in the case of 13% difference it has only 6 sites . ] . even though it is stated in @xcite that first and second shells of @xmath63 sites are taken into account with @xmath57",
    ", we can only reproduce figure  1 of @xcite ( the analogous of our figure  [ fig : dist2nn ] ) if equation  ( [ eq : pecorr ] ) is used with @xmath76 ( an unlikely dielectric constant , as discussed above ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the associated distribution was found to have a rms of @xmath77 .",
    "if we assume the distribution to be gaussian , the full width at half maximum is related with the root mean square @xmath78 as @xmath79 . ] .",
    "this means that a rectangular distribution with the same rms deviation has @xmath80 ; well below the values required for a mit at @xmath70 , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "from the above considerations we may conclude that a realistic parametrisation of diagonal disorder is mandatory for a precise estimate of the effect of substitutional disorder in manganites .",
    "we have performed a transfer matrix calculation @xcite using the model given in equation  ( [ eq : hdedis ] ) , with site energies calculated from a random distribution of the dopant ions @xmath14 .",
    "first and second shells of @xmath63-sites were taken into account assuming equal dielectric constant , which results in random on - site energies given by ( [ eq : eimang ] ) , and a site energy distribution given by ( [ eq : pecorr ] ) . in this case the site disorder is parametrised by @xmath6 , which determines the fraction of @xmath14 ions in the system and thus the variables @xmath60 in [ eq : eimang ] , and by the parameter @xmath33 given in equation  [ eq : v1mang ] , or equivalently the dielectric constant @xmath19 . the doping level @xmath6 also determines the fermi energy in the system , which was calculated by integrating over the disorder averaged density of states obtained for clusters of @xmath81 sites using the recursive green s function method @xcite .",
    "critical value of @xmath33 vs @xmath6 in the paramagnetic ( circles ) and ferromagnetic phases ( triangles ) . a system with @xmath82 in region * i ( iii ) * is metallic ( insulator ) in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases ; in region * ii * the mobility edge crosses the fermi level in the para - ferromagnetic transition .",
    "the inset shows the typical behaviour of the normalised finite - size localisation length @xmath83 vs @xmath84 across the mit for the particular case of @xmath85 in the paramagnetic phase . ]",
    "the transfer matrix technique gives reliable information about the extended or localised nature of the eigenstates @xcite .",
    "for a quasi - one - dimensional system with length @xmath86 and cross - section @xmath87 , where @xmath88 ( in units of the lattice constant ) , the method provides the localisation length @xmath89 of the finite system from the smallest lyapunov exponent of the respective transfer matrix product .",
    "the scaling behaviour of the normalised finite - size localisation length @xmath83 then determines the nature of the eigenstates for a given @xmath6 and @xmath33 at the fermi energy .",
    "extended ( localised ) states show increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath83 as @xmath90 increases .",
    "this behaviour can be appreciated in the inset of figure  [ cap : correlated_model - mobility - edge - v - x ] for @xmath85 in the paramagnetic phase , where the direction of each spin is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution on a sphere .",
    "we have used system bars ( @xmath91 ) with a longitudinal length @xmath86 such that the relative error in @xmath89 is @xmath92 ( typically @xmath93 ) , and @xmath94 . at criticality @xmath83",
    "is independent of @xmath90 , signalling the anderson transition , and providing the critical parameter values @xcite .",
    "the main result of this work is presented in figure  [ cap : correlated_model - mobility - edge - v - x ] . for each concentration",
    "the critical values of @xmath33 , at which the mobility edge and the fermi level coincide , were calculated in the paramagnetic ( circles ) and ferromagnetic phases ( triangles ) . a value of @xmath33 between these two ( i.e. , in region * ii * ) implies a crossing of the fermi level and the mobility edge when the system orders magnetically .",
    "a value of @xmath95 is sufficient to give rise to an anderson mi transition for concentrations @xmath96 .",
    "while it is still higher than the estimate based on @xcite and @xcite , @xmath97 , it is sufficiently close to cast some doubt on a straightforward dismissal of a role of anderson localisation in the magnetoresistance of the manganites .",
    "moreover , the value @xmath97 only takes into account the random distribution of potential sources , namely @xmath13 and @xmath14 ions .",
    "the presence of @xmath98 ionic size mismatch is expected to enhance considerably the disorder effects @xcite .",
    "note also that , in this model the critical value of disorder does not vary monotonically with @xmath6 and shows a maximum at around @xmath99 .",
    "one should bear in mind that , in this model , changing @xmath6 also changes the distribution of site energies [ equation .",
    "( [ eq : pecorr ] ) ] , and so @xmath33 does not , by itself , characterise the disorder .    a final remark regarding the relevance of the model used in this work is in place . the model given by equation  ( [ eq : hdedis ] ) with correlated on - site disorder as in  ( [ eq : eimang ] )",
    "is certainly incomplete : it neglects electron - lattice coupling , orbital degrees of freedom , anti - ferromagnetic exchange between localised @xmath10 spins , and electron - electron interactions between @xmath9 electrons .",
    "consequently , it does not distinguish between the three main manganite groups ( large- , intermediate- , and low - bandwidth ) and can not reproduce many of the complex phases appearing in each of their phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "however , it is general enough and not tremendously complex to address the question of how important is substitutional disorder in manganites ; this is the motivation for using it .",
    "we have shown that a careful analysis of the mn - site energies arising from random distribution of @xmath14 and @xmath13 ions in manganites produce a probability distribution with a rms deviation @xmath100 .",
    "this rms is a consequence of a parametrisation of screened coulomb energies for which an energy shift @xmath97 is assumed to show up in a mn - site whenever a nn replacement @xmath16 occurs .",
    "such a rms value already places the system in the disorder window for which a mit occurs when the ferro - paramagnetic transition takes place .",
    "we have developed a de model with realistic parametrisation of on - site disorder which shows to undergo a mit at the ferro - paramagnetic transition for @xmath95 .",
    "this @xmath33 value is slightly larger than the expected @xmath97 , but it is sufficiently close to unveil the importance of substitutional disorder in manganites and show that disorder must be considered at least on the same foot as the coupling to the lattice .",
    "these findings give support to theories where disorder is a key ingredient @xcite , as the phase - competition scenario for cmr , where diagonal disorder has been found to play a crucial role @xcite .",
    "such a key role played by disorder was also recently observed in a series of experiments in half - doped manganites @xcite , where a - site ordered and disordered systems have been successfully prepared and compared ."
