    "in the last several years , graph theory has experienced a burst of activity as many real systems can be represented and modeled as networks @xcite .",
    "a network is made up of vertices representing the interacting elements of the system and of edges that stand for the interactions among them .",
    "network modeling comprises the analysis and characterization of the structure of networks as well as their modeling in terms of generic models aimed at reproducing the features found in real systems @xcite .",
    "the second important branch has to do with dynamics on networks .",
    "this has lately attracted the attention of many scientists as it is ultimately related with the functioning of the system that is being modeled @xcite .    in this paper , we deal with the first of these areas of research .",
    "the seminal paper by barabsi and albert @xcite , showed that many real world networks can not be described by graphs where the connectivity distribution ( i.e. , the probability that a given node has a given number of links ) follows a poisson - like distribution .",
    "indeed , barabsi and albert showed that most real networks are heterogeneous in the sense that the probability that a node is connected to @xmath0 other nodes follows a power - law distribution @xmath1 , where @xmath2 usually lies between 2 and 3 .",
    "these networks were termed scale - free networks @xcite .    soon afterwards ,",
    "many studies have dealt with the analysis and characterization of models that generate scale - free networks , along with other global and local topological properties found in real networked systems @xcite . in particular , models based on the mechanism of preferential attachment ( pa ) , no matter if the network is growing or not , have been extensively studied in the last years .",
    "there are some models in which the pa rule is limited to a neighborhood due to geographic constraints @xcite or lack of global knowledge @xcite , or where its linear character is investigated @xcite .",
    "while today we have recognized that preferential attachment is not a necessary condition for the formation of scale - free networks @xcite , it seems to be clear that it is an important mechanism .",
    "indeed , most of the existing models intrinsically incorporate a preferential attachment like rule . on the other hand , uniform random linking of nodes on growing networks",
    "gives rise to networks where the degree distribution decays exponentially fast with the degree @xmath0 , thus producing homogeneous networks with a well defined ( and meaningful ) average value for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the combination of the two rules , i.e , uniform and preferential linking , have been also analyzed in several models for interpolating between scale - free and exponential networks @xcite .",
    "for instance , liu _",
    "et al _ @xcite have studied a model in which the probability of establishing new links goes as a linear combination of both in such a way that a new link is established between a node @xmath3 and a new one proportionally to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 weights the contribution of the two mechanisms . however , in previous models of this sort , there is an assumption that does not apply always .",
    "it has to do with the fact that the network always grows around a single component of connected nodes and uniform or preferential links from the emerging nodes are always made with elements belonging to this unique cluster .",
    "this single component grows linearly in time until it reaches the size of the network .",
    "since there are no clusters of nodes other than the giant component , the models can not account for phenomena such as the coalescence of small networks into a larger one , nor for situations in which more than one node is added to a preexisting structure at each time step , features that may be relevant in social , economic and other networked systems .    in this paper , we analyze a model that interpolates between erdos - rnyi ( er ) and scale - free ( sf ) networks as far as the degree distribution is concerned through a tunable parameter . by construction ,",
    "new links are not always established with nodes previouly incorporated to the network .",
    "we explore analytically and numerically the time behavior of nodes attachment as well as of the degree evolution .",
    "we find that , depending on the interplay between uniform and preferential linking , the transition from an er like network to an sf one is smooth or more abrupt .",
    "we finally discuss other topological properties and perform a numerical percolation study that highlights the differences in their structure .",
    "the model presented here is useful as it provides a unique recipe to go progressively from homogeneous to heterogeneous topologies as well as for exploring the interplay between them .",
    "the model introduced in this work generates a one - parameter family of complex networks .",
    "this parameter , @xmath6 $ ] , measures the degree of heterogeneity of the final networks .",
    "let us assume the final size of the network to be @xmath7 .",
    "the network is generated in the following way :    * start from a fully connected network of @xmath8 nodes and a set @xmath9 of @xmath10 unconnected nodes .",
    "* at each time step choose a new node @xmath11 from @xmath12 .",
    "* this node makes a link in two ways : * * with probability @xmath13 it links to any other node @xmath3 of the whole set of @xmath14 nodes with uniform probability @xmath15 * * with probability @xmath16 establish a link following a preferential attachment strategy , that is , the probability for any other node @xmath3 to attach to node @xmath11 is a function of its connectivity as , @xmath17 where different choices for the functional form of @xmath18 are analyzed below . *",
    "repeat @xmath19 times step _ ( iii ) _ for the same node @xmath11 . * repeat @xmath20 times steps _ ( ii ) _ to _ ( iv)_.    a schematic plot of the linking procedure at step _ ( iii ) _ is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the above rules allow for the coexistence of two classes of nodes .",
    "on one hand , there are nodes with at least one link .",
    "this set will be referred to henceforth as the connected set @xmath21 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is another set @xmath22 of isolated nodes such that its size is @xmath23 . at variance with other models",
    "in which there are only nodes with connectivity different from zero and thus the connected component grows linearly with time , the above rules allows the addition of more than one node to the set @xmath21 as a result of random linking .",
    "therefore , we expect the time dependency of @xmath21 to be highly non trivial .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     one of the most important differences between er graphs and sf networks is given by the radically different behaviors of dynamical processes that take place on top of them @xcite .",
    "for instance , epidemic spreading processes show a natural threshold below which the epidemic can not spread for er graphs , while this threshold is absent in the thermodynamic limit in sf networks with a diverging second moment @xcite .",
    "this kind of behavior is precisely what makes scale - free networks so special .",
    "we have implemented a percolation process on top of the networks generated by models a and b. it is aimed at simulating the random failures of a fraction @xmath24 of nodes @xcite . by computing the size of the giant connected component , one can characterize the percolation transition . here",
    ", however , we are not interested in the transition _ per se _ , but on the influence of the topological features unraveled in the previous section on the size of the giant component of the network .",
    "as expected , the behavior of the two models is different when the limit of er graphs is approached for the same values of @xmath13 .    as usual",
    ", we have analyzed the evolution of the size of the giant component of the network after a fraction @xmath24 of the nodes ( and hence their links ) are removed from it . in this sense , it is relevant to study the relation @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the size of the giant component of the network for @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , since this will clearly unravel the two different approaches from the scale - free limit to the erdos - rnyi network . as can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the differences between the sf and er networks are relevant when @xmath24 is high due to the different critical behaviors near the transition point @xcite .",
    "more interesting for our concerns is the evolution of the magnitude @xmath25 as a function of @xmath13 . for high values of @xmath24 we can clearly appreaciate the fast approach from sf to er supplied by model a ( upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the size of the giant component is very similar to that corresponding to the er graph for ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in contrast , the transition exhibited for the same values of @xmath24 when model b is implemented reveals again a slower transition between sf and er networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] down ) .",
    "in particular one can observe that the values of @xmath25 for @xmath31 are similar to those for @xmath32 in model a.    the two different behaviors observed can be explained in terms of the topological measures showed in the previous section , in particular with the behavior of the second moment of the degree distribution @xmath33 which is known to play a key role for understanding the different transitions in sf and er networks .",
    "it is known that the critical value of @xmath24 relates to the moments of the distribution as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . from fig.[fig:5](b ) , one can see that for model a , the second moment of the degree distribution approaches the value obtained in er limit for intermediate values of @xmath13 .",
    "this is no anymore the case for model b , in which the ratio @xmath36 approaches @xmath37 only for values close to @xmath29 .",
    "given that the average connectivity @xmath38 is the same for all values of @xmath13 in both models , we should expect that the behavior of a percolation process near the critical point would be nearly the same to that of er networks when @xmath39 .",
    "this is the situation for a broader range of @xmath13 values in model a as suggested by fig.[fig:5](b ) . in other words ,",
    "the different behaviors for the two networks families observed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] can be explained in terms of the speed at which @xmath40 convergences to its corresponding value in the er limit .",
    "the implemented percolation dynamics serves us to illustrate how the interpolating model presented in this work can be a useful tool for discovering what topological features are fundamental to explain the different behaviors observed when more complex dynamics are studied .",
    "moreover , real networks are not purely scale - free nor completely er , so that their behavior in front of percolation like processes lies in between these extreme cases as clearly shown in fig .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed a model that interpolates between erdos - rnyi and scale - free networks .",
    "the combination of uniform and preferential linking allows us to explore the whole path between the two limiting cases .",
    "an important feature of our model is that the size of the connected set does not grow linearly with the number of nodes attached to the network .",
    "this is a result of the novel ingredient of the model , that through the uniform random linking allows every node to take part on the network irrespective of their connectivities ( even if they are not connected at all ) .",
    "we have analyzed two different variants for the interpolation between the erdos - rnyi and scale - free limits .",
    "on one model the transition is smooth , while for the other it becomes sharper .",
    "the analytical insights together with numerical simulations supported that the differences in the versions analyzed are rooted at the interplay between uniform and preferential attachment .",
    "finally , simulations of a percolation process have illustrated the differences in both formulations and their associated transitions ( which are easily explained when looking at the topological properties of the networks ) .",
    "as for future works , the present model provides a useful tool to study the influence of the degree of heterogeneity in dynamical processes of different kinds just as the watts - strogatz model have proved to do so in the transition from regular to random structures .",
    "in particular , there exist open questions in phenomena such as the synchronization of coupled oscillators @xcite where this kind of model could be particularly relevant to explore the system s behavior in the region where homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures coexist .",

    "we recall on the possibility that the connected set is temporarily composed by more than one connected component .",
    "this is the case for the initial stage of the network growth when @xmath41 .",
    "however , when @xmath7 is high enough the final network is composed by a unique connected component ."
