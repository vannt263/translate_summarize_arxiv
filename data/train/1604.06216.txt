    "in theoretical astrophysics there is a growing interest to discuss the stellar structures in which the matter content is an anisotropic fluid .",
    "the effect of anisotropy can be studied both in newtonian gravity and general relativity . for the configurations with not extremely high densities ,",
    "the presence of anisotropy factor has been discussed in newtonian regime@xcite and otherwise general relativity must be used .    in 1972",
    "ruderman @xcite for the first time argued that the nuclear matter may have anisotropic features in very high density regime ( @xmath0 ) and thus the nuclear interaction needs to be treated under relativistic point of view .",
    "after the pioneering work of bowers and liang @xcite in 1974 , the study of anisotropic distribution of matter got wide attention .",
    "anisotropy arises due to the existence of solid stellar core or by the presence of type - iiia superfluid @xcite , phase transitions , pion condensation in a star @xcite , electromagnetic field @xcite , rotation , etc .",
    "most studies assume that the matter of the anisotropic star is described by an equation of state relating the radial pressure @xmath1 or transversal pressure @xmath2 to the energy density @xmath3 .",
    "the polytropic equation of state is one of the most important choices for a state equation which has a wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "this equation of state is written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the polytropic exponent and @xmath6 is known as the polytropic index . for @xmath7 , the exact solutions of einstein s field equations for an anisotropic sphere have been obtained by thirukkanesh and ragel @xcite .    the anisotropic model has been investigated for uniform matter density in @xcite and for variable density distribution in @xcite .",
    "anisotropic pressure can affect on the stability of the stellar objects .",
    "dev and gleiser @xcite have extended the variational formalism of chandrasekhar @xcite for isotropic star to study the stability of anisotropic general relativistic spheres against the radial perturbations .",
    "assuming some specific density profiles and the adiabatic exponent , they have found that there can exist stable relativistic anisotropic spheres leading to instability in isotropic spheres .    here",
    "our main purpose is to to obtain the exact solutions of general relativistic star equations in the presence of anisotropic pressure .",
    "maharaj and sharma @xcite have obtained some exact solutions of compact anisotropic stars analytically by assuming a linear equation of state with an appropriate ansatz .",
    "the investigation of anisotropic configurations was not restricted to static spherically symmetric cases .",
    "cylinderically symmetric models have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "also the modeling of dense charged gravitating objects in strong gravitational fields has attracted much interest in recent years because of its relevance to relativistic astrophysics .",
    "the investigation of these objects requires an exact solution of the einstein - maxwell system . anisotropic fluid with a linear , quadratic and polytopic equation of state in the presence of electromagnetic field",
    "is studied in @xcite .",
    "the importance of an equation of state in a stellar model has been emphasized by varela et al @xcite who provided a mechanism of dealing with charged anisotropic matter in a general approach . and also",
    "the exact solutions for a charged anisotropic quark star have been reported by sunzu et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "anisotropy can exist not only in ordinary compact stars but also in the hypothetical objects like boson stars @xcite and gravastars @xcite .",
    "besides the isolated objects in astrophysics , anisotropy is present in globular clusters , galactic bulges and dark halos @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to discuss the anisotropic polytropes in the context of general relativity . in the next section",
    "we derive the relativistic lane - emden equations in the presence of anisotropy factor .",
    "then we obtain their boundary conditions and generalize the chandrasekhar s theorem@xcite to the anisotropic case . in section 3 , first we find a series expansion for the dimensionless lane - emden function , @xmath8 , and the anisotropy factor , @xmath9 , near the center of star . then in order to obtain the exact solutions , we have assumed that the presence of anisotropy factor does not change the general form of the relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium equations .",
    "this ansatz leads us to find a new class of exact solutions for the anisotropic lane - emden equations for constant density .",
    "this procedure is different from the usual approach @xcite which is to suppose an ansatz on the form of anisotropy factor and try to get the physical solution of the equations . at the end in section 4",
    ", we present a summary of the main conclusions .",
    "since we deal with the static and spherically symmetric configurations , we use the following metric : @xmath10}dt^2-\\exp[{\\kappa(r)}]dr^2-r^2d\\omega^2\\,,\\ ] ] the components of energy - momentum tensor for anisotropic matter are : @xmath11 @xmath12 so the einstein s field equations become : @xmath13-\\frac{1}{r^2}=\\frac{{8\\pi g } p _ r}{c^4}\\ ] ] @xmath14+\\frac{1}{r^2}=\\frac{{8\\pi g}\\rho}{c^2}\\ ] ] @xmath15=\\frac{{8\\pi g } p_{\\perp}}{c^4}\\ ] ] and the radial component of bianchi identities reduces to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath16 in fact this equation can be obtained from equations ( [ eins1 ] ) - ( [ eins3 ] ) and usually it is convenient to use it instead of ( [ eins3 ] ) .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eins1]),([eins2 ] ) and ( [ tov.rel ] ) contain five unknown functions , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and we have to add two more equations to make the set of equations closed .",
    "to do this , we use the polytropic equation of state and introduce a new ansatz for anisotropy factor which is explained in the next section .    to obtain a unique solution of the einstein s equations",
    ", one must also specify the boundary conditions .",
    "outside the star , the spacetime geometry is described by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "thus we have : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radius of star and @xmath24 is its mass . by integrating ( [ eins2 ] ) with initial condition @xmath25 ( in order to avoid a singularity , @xmath26 must tend to zero at least as @xmath27 for @xmath28 ) , we get : @xmath29\\ ] ] by defining the auxiliary function : @xmath30}{2gm}=\\frac{m(r)}{m } \\quad ; \\quad ( u(0)=0 , u(r)=1)\\ ] ] equation ( [ eins2 ] ) becomes : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the relativistic mass inside the radius @xmath33 : @xmath34 by using ( [ tov.rel ] ) and ( [ aux.rel ] ) , we can obtain the tov equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the spherically static aniotropic star from ( [ eins1 ] ) : @xmath35}{r^2[1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{c^2r}]}+\\frac{2\\delta}{r}\\ ] ] as it is obvious , vanishing @xmath9 recovers the tov equation for isotropic star .",
    "moreover in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath36 ) , one can easily obtain the anisotropic jeans equation for radial pressure : @xmath37 the boundary conditions of ( [ tov ] ) are : @xmath38 @xmath39 these conditions imply that the radial pressure is finite at the origin and vanishes at the surface of star .",
    "the mass function @xmath32 goes to zero at the origin and reduces to the total mass at the surface . for a specified @xmath9 and implying an equation of state : @xmath40 we obtain a closed system of equations , ( [ mass ] ) , ( [ tov ] ) and ( [ eos ] ) .",
    "then the metric coefficients are given by ( [ tov.rel ] ) and ( [ mass.eqn ] ) .    as we have mentioned before , for many astrophysical applications , assuming the polytropic equation of state",
    "enables one to make an approximate model of a star .",
    "one can always parametrize this equation by introducing the lane - emden function defined by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the central values of relativistic density and pressure .",
    "with respect to this new function , equation ( [ tov.rel ] ) becomes : @xmath44 where @xmath45 this equation yields : @xmath46 where the integration constant @xmath47 is the central value of @xmath48 . to find it , we use the fact that the value of the above expression is given by relation ( [ match ] ) at the surface of the star",
    "this yields to : @xmath49 so we can write the metric coefficient @xmath18 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath9 as : @xmath50 substituting @xmath51 from ( [ aux.rel ] ) and @xmath52 from ( [ tov.pol ] ) into equation ( [ eins1 ] ) , and using ( [ mass.eqn ] ) , the above equation reduces to : @xmath53    now defining the dimensionless parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 where , and the minus sign if @xmath57 @xmath58 , equations ( [ mass.eqn ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) take the following form : @xmath59 @xmath60 which are the general relativistic lane - emden equations for anisotropic polytropes . in the non - relativistic limit , according to ( [ q ] ) , @xmath61 and one can recover the newtonian anisotropic lane - emden equation @xcite . also setting @xmath62 ,",
    "the isotropic lane - emden equation is obtained .    in equation ( [ l.e.n1 ] ) if @xmath63 tends to zero , we will have : @xmath64 so we arrive at the following theorem :    * theorem * : _ the finite solutions of relativistic anisotropic lane - emden equations at the origin have to satisfy the following relations_:@xmath65 this is the generalization of theorem 1 in @xcite for the relativistic anisotropic case .",
    "in this section we shall discuss how one can solve the lane - emden equations ( [ l.e.n1 ] ) , ( [ l.e.n2 ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ init ] ) .",
    "these are a system of two equations for three unknowns , the function @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . to solve these equations",
    ", we need another equation .",
    "one can assume either a special form for one of the above functions or a mathemtaical relation between these functions in order to the set of equations be closed .",
    "here we use the latter approach which is explained in section 3.2 .",
    "first in section 3.1 we find a series expansion of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 near the center of anisotropic star . for isotropic case one can find the corresponding series expansion in@xcite and the references in it .",

    "a similar calculation for isotropic star has been derived by tooper @xcite . in this case , the variables @xmath8 and @xmath55 are separable and the exact analytical solutions of ( [ l.e.n1 ] ) and ( [ l.e.n2 ] ) for @xmath62 , are @xcite : @xmath73}{q_0[3(1+q_0)-(1 + 3q_0)\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2q_0\\xi^2}{3}}]}\\ ] ] @xmath74      near the center of star , we assume that : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 inserting these expressions into the lane - emden equations ( [ l.e.n1 ] ) and ( [ l.e.n2 ] ) , we get : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 provided that the pressure and density gradient ( and also @xmath81 according to equation ( [ init ] ) ) are finite at the center of star . thus if @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . comparing equations ( [ coef1])-([coef3 ] ) with ( [ coefi1 ] ) and ( [ coefi2 ] )",
    ", one can find that how the anisotropy factor affects the behaviour of quantities near the center of star .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the presence of @xmath9 does not change the forms of isotropic lane - emden equations and it only modifies the coefficients of these equations . to do this ,",
    "noting equation ( [ tov.pol ] ) , we introduce a constant @xmath86 such that ( hereafter we set @xmath87 ) : @xmath88    substituting this into equation ( [ tov.pol ] ) and integrating it , the metric coefficient @xmath18 becomes : @xmath89\\ ] ] which is identical to the isotropic one @xcite in which the coefficient @xmath6 has changed to @xmath86 . using equations ( [ aux.rel ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) and defining a dimensionless parameter @xmath54 such that : @xmath90 where @xmath91^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] . equations ( [ l.e.n1 ] ) and ( [ l.e.n2 ] )",

    "we want to obtain the analytical solution of anisotropic lane - emden equations for constant density . for @xmath94 , a solution of equations ( [ le1 ] ) and ( [ le2 ] ) satisfying the initial conditions ( [ init ] )",

    "this solution vanishes at : @xmath98}\\ ] ] which is the dimensionless value of the radial coordinate at the boundary .",
    "thus we find that : @xmath99 with suitable choices of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the equations of ( [ sol ] ) and ( [ sol delta ] ) present a new class of solution for an anisotropic constant - density star .",
    "this solution can be considered as a well - defined solution if the physical quantities like the anisotropy factor be finite inside the star .",
    "it can be easily shown that for all values of @xmath101 and @xmath100 , the anisotropy factor ( [ sol delta ] ) is finite .",
    "also if @xmath102 , the anisotropy factor has a local maximum inside the star but this is not true for @xmath103 . here in figure [ fig1 ] we have plotted @xmath104 as a function of @xmath54 for some values of @xmath101 and @xmath100 . for any choice ,",
    "the plots are from the center to the corresponding radius of the star .",
    "the radial pressure is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] for the same values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 as in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "now it becomes clear that it is a positive regular function everywhere inside the star .",
    "it starts with its local maximum value at the center of the star and gradually decreases until it vanishes at the surface of star .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]    now let us to discuss the validity of energy conditions .",
    "since @xmath101 is positive , the weak , null and strong energy conditions hold for every positive value of central pressure .",
    "a simple calculation shows that for cases with @xmath105 , the dominant energy condition is satisfied same as the other conditions .",
    "but for cases with @xmath106 , this condition is not satisfied within a radius of @xmath107^{\\frac{3}{k}}\\}}$ ] from the center of star . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", we have plotted the dominant energy condition as a function of @xmath54 for different values of @xmath101 and @xmath100 . while the dashed lines in each cases represent @xmath108 and",
    "@xmath109 , it is clear that for @xmath110 there is a violation of the dominant energy condition .",
    "[ fig3 ]    other quantities of physical interest are the stellar radius and mass . to find these , it is needed to find the radius of the star , @xmath111 , measured by an external observer .",
    "this radius for an anisotropic polytropic sphere with constant density is : @xmath112dr=\\tilde{\\alpha } \\int_0^{\\xi_r } \\frac{d\\xi}{\\sqrt{1 - 2q_0(m+1)\\frac{\\xi^2}{3}}}= \\\\ \\tilde{\\alpha } ( \\frac{3}{2q_0(m+1)})^{1/2}\\arcsin{(\\frac{2q_0(m+1)\\xi_r^2}{3})^{1/2}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for @xmath113 , relation ( [ radius ] ) reduces to the corresponding radius in the case of isotropic star@xcite .",
