    "the common lore , that one  does not expect any macroscopic body to possess a net charge \"  @xcite is certainly compelling observationally .",
    "but it invites the question , especially relevant during black hole formation :  how long does it take for a charged spherical body to neutralize ? \" here we answer that question in three different ways .",
    "we consider the problem of charge neutralization for  classical \" newton - coulomb black holes , and compare the time required to neutralize a central spherical body to the time required for a ( special ) relativistic neutralization , and finally , a full general relativistic calculation .    in all cases",
    ", we have a specific model in mind ",
    "take a central body of mass @xmath0 carrying charge @xmath1 where @xmath2 is some fundamental unit of charge ( the charge of the constituent particles making up the central body , say ) and @xmath3 is a large number .",
    "the neutralization process consists of arranging @xmath3 test charges , each carrying charge @xmath4 , in a sphere of radius @xmath5 and allowing them to fall radially inward under the influence of both gravity and the coulomb force .",
    "note that we ignore the force on the charges associated with the shell itself ( which , as we discuss at the end , changes the ratio of coulomb - to - gravitational interaction by a factor of one half ) .",
    "we will take our model central body to be a black hole , so there is a natural radius @xmath6 associated with the end of the infall process , the schwarzschild radius ( in the un - charged case ) .",
    "this model ignores the interaction of the  test masses \" forming the charged spherical shell , and since each test particle falls radially in , they all take the same time to reach the radius of the spherical body .",
    "so we have a minimum time - to - neutralization , with no angular momentum , and no inter - particle interaction .",
    "these simplifying assumptions mean that we can focus on a single test particle , and our work amounts to repeatedly finding the time it takes that particle to go from @xmath5 ( at rest ) to @xmath6 in various settings of increasing physical sophistication .",
    "consider a sphere of radius @xmath7 with mass @xmath0 distributed uniformly throughout its volume .",
    "the sphere sets up a gravitational force on massive particles  we can define the escape speed for test particles as the minimum speed needed to start at the surface of the sphere and end at spatial infinity ( at rest ) . that is just the usual :",
    "@xmath8 but this equation can , in a sense , be turned around  instead of the escape speed @xmath9 , we can ask for what radius @xmath6 does light itself  just \" escape the gravitational field of the central body ? from  ( [ escape ] ) , with @xmath10",
    ", we have : @xmath11 this classical result is well - known : john michell , the british geologist discussed this special radius in 1783 , and laplace independently developed the same idea in 1796 , it is given in the first edition of _ exposition du systeme du monde _ ( although he removed it from subsequent editions ) .",
    "more of the history of these early  dark stars \" can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the argument that takes us from  ( [ escape ] ) to  ( [ radius ] ) relies on canceling the @xmath12s appearing on either side of  ( [ escape ] ) prior to solving for @xmath6  otherwise , the massless photon returns @xmath13 trivially .",
    "it is interesting , then , that the same fundamental length ( associated with a given mass @xmath0 ) appears in general relativity , where @xmath6 is the  event horizon \" associated with the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the physical interpretation is also the same  that is the radius at which not even light can escape the gravitational field of the central body . both because of the classical argument , and its general relativistic relevance",
    ", we will take our classical central bodies to have radius @xmath14 , and that will define the impact radius for the test particles that we send in to bring about the neutralization .    the problem we need to solve , then , is : given a uniformly charged sphere of radius @xmath6 carrying total charge @xmath1 and mass @xmath0 , how long does it take a test particle of mass @xmath12 and charge @xmath4 to reach @xmath6 if it starts from rest at @xmath5 ?",
    "the setup is shown in  figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "carrying charge @xmath4 is released from rest a distance @xmath5 from a central sphere of mass @xmath0 carrying total charge @xmath15 .",
    "how long does it take for the test mass to reach the surface of the central sphere , @xmath6?,width=288 ]      to answer this question in the classical setting , we could work directly from newton s second law : @xmath16 and integrate twice to find @xmath17 , then invert @xmath18 to find the time @xmath19 at which the test particle collides with the central body .",
    "it is slightly easier ( and more generalizable for future calculations ) to start from the hamiltonian , representing the total energy of the system : @xmath20 because we want to compare the charged case with the un - charged case , we define the force ratio @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 recovers the newton ( with no coulomb ) result .",
    "then  ( [ totale ] ) can be solved for @xmath23 : @xmath24 finally , we can render each term dimensionless by setting @xmath25 and @xmath26 for dimensionless @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "now @xmath6 is the schwarzschild radius , but @xmath31 is some characteristic time that is up to us  motivated by the first term on the right in  ( [ rho2 ] ) and the definition @xmath32 , we set @xmath33 , and then : @xmath34    all that s left to do is encode the initial conditions : let @xmath35 , then @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    "however , the particular solution found here is not extensible to the general relativistic version of the neutralization problem , and we would like to use the same approach in both the classical and relativistic cases . from that point of view , we want a method that will allow us to determine @xmath41 absent an explicit expression ( ugly or not ) .",
    "we use a runge - kutta routine with a root - finding procedure to solve  ( [ rho2ff ] ) for @xmath41 such that @xmath42 as a function of @xmath50  @xcite . the result for @xmath51 ( so we start at a distance @xmath52 from the center of the central body ) is shown in  figure  [ fig : nc ] .",
    "as is to be expected , the neutralization time decreases as the electrostatic - to - gravitational force ratio gets larger ( we are increasing the total magnitude of the force on the test particles ) . for comparison and as a test of the method ,",
    "the exact result  ( [ exacter ] ) is plotted in  figure  [ fig : nc ] as well .    .",
    "the black points are the numerically computed time , the blue curve is the plot of  ( [ exacter]).,width=336 ]    as this is a classical calculation , the speed limit of special relativity will surely be violated at some point . in these units ,",
    "the speed of light is @xmath48 , and it is clear from  ( [ rho2ff ] ) that when : @xmath53 the speed of the test particle will be greater than @xmath54 . for @xmath22 , we see that @xmath55 for all values of @xmath27 , since @xmath56 ( when @xmath57 , we are at @xmath58 , and the test particle has collided with the central body ) and @xmath59 . that makes sense when you think about how the radius @xmath6 was chosen , but if @xmath60 , it is possible that the inequality in  ( [ rhocut ] ) is achieved by values of @xmath56 , leading to particle speeds greater than that of light prior to collision with the central body . in order to address this issue , we re - run the analysis starting from the total energy associated with special relativity .",
    "the equation replacing  ( [ totale ] ) in the relativistic setting is : @xmath61 where the rest energy of the test particle is now included in @xmath62 ( and the rest of relativistic dynamics is built in ) . in the dimensionless variables of the previous section ,",

    "this makes sense , since classically , particles can travel faster than @xmath54 , while the relativistic speed limit  limits particle speeds . when the attractive force is greater , a larger portion of the classical trajectory has particle speed greater than @xmath54 , while the relativistic trajectory always has speed @xmath68 , leading to a longer time .    , and in blue , the original non - relativistic result from  figure  [ fig : nc ] . at some point , the relativistic speed saturates , a feature not shared by the classical trajectories ",
    "since the special relativistic particles must travel @xmath69 , they have an overall longer neutralization time.,width=336 ]    there is , of course , a natural limit in the case of special relativity ",
    "the test particles need to travel a distance @xmath70 and the maximum speed at which they could do so would be @xmath54 , leading to @xmath71 or , in our current units , @xmath72 .",
    "the newtonian potential used in  ( [ speciale ] ) is a natural starting point for relativistic investigation , but the special relativistic case presented here does not take into account the fact that newtonian gravity , unlike e&m , is not consistent with special relativity .",
    "the point - source solution we have used solves laplace s equation , and therefore implies that the gravitational force changes instantaneously with a change in the source properties . while not an immediate concern for this static configuration , it is a hallmark of bad behavior under lorentz transformation ( in e&m , the magnetic field saves the special relativistic character of maxwell s equations , and there is an analagous approximate force that can be introduced to perturbatively correct the newtonian gravitational field  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the reconciliation of gravity with special relativity leads to general relativity .",
    "in general relativity ( gr ) , einstein s equations relate the field of the theory to sources just as maxwell s equations do for e&m . there are deep structural differences between the two , but the story we tell ourselves :  sources generate fields \" is the same . the field of gr ( the target functions , like the potentials @xmath73 and @xmath74 of e&m ) is the metric of spacetime , and the sources are mass and moving mass ( more generally , since mass and energy are equivalent , any form of energy or moving energy ) .",
    "once einstein s equations have been solved , the metric influences the motion of test particles , just as once you have solved for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , you can find the force on test particles from the lorentz force law in e&m .",
    "the nature of that influence , for gravity , is different , but the end result is a hamiltonian similar to  ( [ speciale ] ) , depending in a more complicated way on the location of the test particle .",
    "the total energy replacing  ( [ totale ] ) and  ( [ speciale ] ) in general relativity , for a massive central body carrying charge @xmath15 ( the so - called reissner - nordstrom @xcite solution to einstein s equation ) is : @xmath75 as a check , you should try expanding the above in @xmath7 and verify that you recover  ( [ speciale ] ) .",
    "notice that we only introduced the coulomb potential as  additional \" energy  the first term in the hamiltonian is associated with the rest energy , the kinetic energy , and a  new \" relativistic energy ( reducing to the newtonian gravitational potential in the appropriate limit ) .",

    ", we must be careful to define the starting point .",
    "in general relativity , the distance between two points ( length ) is determined by the metric of spacetime , and this metric has different values based on our choice of @xmath50 .",
    "if we insist that the ( radial ) distance travelled by the test particles be @xmath80 ( @xmath81 by definition of our problem , and we start the particles at @xmath82 ) , then each value of @xmath50 used to generate  figure  [ fig : grttn ] requires a different starting point . in particular , we want @xmath83 , for : @xmath84}^{-1/2 } \\",

    "we can use this equation to determine the label of our starting point , @xmath86 , in the modified spacetime setting  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a simple model for the neutralization of a charged central body and carried out both the classical and special relativistic analysis for a variety of charge - to - mass ratios .",
    "the time it takes to neutralize a central body using special relativistic dynamics is longer than the corresponding time calculated from newton s second law since in the relativistic case , particles can not travel faster than @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , we set up and solved the analogous neutralization problem in general relativity , using the reissner - nordstrom metric to generate equations of motion for a charged test particle in that setting .",
    "it is interesting that while the general relativity form of the problem involves a variety of new physical ideas , the actual execution of the calculation is remarkably similar to its classical and special relativistic counterparts .",
    "as long as our test particles start far away from the central body , the general relativistic limit will match the special relativistic one ( the test particles stay away from the strong field region of the spacetime , where interpretation is not straightforward ) . in our case ,",
    "starting @xmath87 schwarzschild radii away led to virtually identical results for special and general relativity .",
    "our model for neutralization was the simplest available  more sophisticated approaches , like that taken in  @xcite where the change in charge of the central body as the neutralization occurs is considered , provide additional physical insight when the classical and relativistic cases are compared .",
    "in addition , we could consider the force associated with the neutralizing sphere itself  that changes what we mean by @xmath50 in a particular model by introducing the repulsive shell force : @xmath88 for each particle @xcite .",
    "this exercise , on the classical side , would provide a good introduction to the problem of spherical collapse in general relativity , where that same  self - force \" is interesting @xcite . indeed in the general relativistic case ,",
    "collapse depends on the details of the dust elements falling into the central black hole  the self - gravity of these can not be ignored , and is an integral part of the study of astrophysically relevant collapse .",
    "even our modest toy problem becomes more involved in the full gr case .",
    "in addition to the above simplifications , where we ignore the interaction of the test particles with each other , we have also left out the interaction of the test particles with themselves .",
    "there are electromagnetic radiative corrections that will tend to slow the particle s progress , as energy is lost to the radiation fields .",
    "these corrections can be calculated in the classical and relativistic cases using familiar electrodynamics notions ( as in chapter 11 of  @xcite ) .    in our simplified setting",
    ", we can put some relatively concrete bounds on the neutralization time .",
    "taking the special relativistic result , in the large @xmath50 limit , we know that the minimum possible time is @xmath72 , or , with units : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of schwarschild radii away we use as the starting point , and @xmath6 is the schwarzschild radius of a neutral black hole  @xcite .",
    "the minimum time scales like @xmath90  we expect @xmath6 to be a small number ",
    "if we take a supermassive black hole with a mass of , say , @xmath91 , then @xmath92 km and the time it takes for light to travel @xmath93 is about a minute , instantaneous on the timescale of the universe . of course ,",
    "the extreme special relativistic limit supposed that @xmath50 is large , we can imagine much longer times , up to the amount of time it takes for uncharged material to fall radially into the black hole ( the @xmath22 limit ) .    from our assumption that @xmath94 , in which the infalling matter is the same as that constituting the central body , we have restricted ourselves , in the general relativistic version of the problem .",
    "for the reisnner - nordstrom spacetime , we must have @xmath95 ( in units where @xmath96 ) , so the maximum value of @xmath15 is @xmath0 , giving @xmath97 , the neutralization is then dominated by the charge - free case . if we relax this requirement , then we can have @xmath98 , say ( for a maximally charged central body ) , and we are still free to choose @xmath99  taking , for example , the proton leads to @xmath100 , and that will give near - maximal values for the special relativistic case .",
    "the spherical shell represents a pretty minimal neutralization model  we expect more than just falling straight in from our neutralizing particles . in all of these settings ,",
    "a more realistic  cloud \" of particles with varying initial velocities and positions would lead to a more realistic ( and necessarily longer ) neutralization time , and these can be computed numerically in all three of the cases studied here .",
    "the inclusion of a self - force and calculation of a consistent spacetime for astrophysical black holes requires full gr and is an involved task  our goal here , motivated by the astrophysical observation that macroscopic bodies are neutral , is to provide a simple model that can be studied relatively completely in the classical , special and general relativistic frameworks .",
