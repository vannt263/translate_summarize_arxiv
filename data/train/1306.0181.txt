    "high resolution spectroscopy of quasars shows a large number of absorption lines blueward of ly@xmath0 mostly due to neutral hydrogen components in intergalactic medium intervening along the line of sight .",
    "these quasar absorption systems due to hydrogen are classified according to the column densities .",
    "quasar absorption systems with a neutral column density not exceeding @xmath13 constitute the ly@xmath0 forest which is attributed to the residual hydrogen atoms contained in intergalactic filamentary structures that are highly ionized ( e.g. rauch 1998 , meiksin 2009 , kim et al .",
    "the absorption systems associated with a neutral hydrogen column density in excess of @xmath14 are called the damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) , which are distinguished from other quasar absorption systems in that they are dominantly neutral ( e.g. wolfe et al .",
    "1986 , 2005 ) .",
    "a catalogue of 322 dlas was provided by curran et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and recently 721 dlas are listed from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( khare et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the exact nature of the dlas is still controversial , but they are believed to dominate the neutral gas content in the universe , providing raw material for star formation during most of the time from the reionization era to the present ( e.g. wolfe et al .",
    "2005 , prochaska , herbert - fort & wolfe 2005 ) .",
    "dlas are also important to trace the chemical evolution of the universe by carefully measuring the metal abundance as a function of redshift ( e.g. calura , matteucci & vladilo 2003 , rafelski et al .",
    "accurate atomic physics for ly@xmath0 is essential to obtain a reliable estimate of metallicity of a dla .",
    "recently , kulkarni et al . (",
    "2012 ) reported a discovery of  super - damped  lyman - alpha absorber at @xmath15 toward the qso q1135 - 0010 .",
    "their profile fit to the dla showed a high neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath16 .",

    "damped ly@xmath0 absorption profiles are analyzed using the voigt function which is defined as a convolution of a lorentzian function with a gaussian function ( e.g. rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "when @xmath4 is very large , the absorption at the core part is almost complete . contributing only to the core part of the voigt function",
    ", the gaussian function does not play an important role in the analysis of high column density systems . in the wing part",
    "the voigt function coincides with the lorentzian , and in this case the damping term in the denominator of the lorentzian is quite negligible .",
    "therefore , the wing profile is essentially proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the difference in wavelength from the ly@xmath0 line center wavelength @xmath21 .",
    "the lorentzian function , invoked to describe the wing parts of the absorption profile , is obtained when the scattering atom is regarded as a two - level atom . instead of being a two - level system ,",
    "the hydrogen atom has infinitely many energy levels , and therefore the scattering cross section is expected to deviate from the lorentzian function that is symmetric with respect to the line center wavelength .",
    "peebles ( 1993 ) discussed the resonance line shape that deviates from the simple lorentzian and mentioned the marginal possibility of detecting this deviation in the absorption line profiles of dla systems ( e.g. peebles 1993 , p. 573 ) .",
    "the formula for the scattering cross section he introduced is derived in a heuristic way to illustrate the behavior of the lorentzian profile near line resonance and the classical @xmath22-dependence in the low energy regime . however , this formula is inaccurate because it fails to include the contributions from the infinitely many @xmath2 states that participate in the electric dipole interaction .",
    "the exact scattering cross section is computed by summing all the probability amplitudes contributed from the infinitely many bound and free @xmath2 states .",
    "the result is summarized in the kramers - heisenberg formula ( e.g. bethe & salpeter 1967 , sakurai 1967 ) .",
    "an expansion of the kramers - heisenberg formula around ly@xmath0 in frequency space was given by lee ( 2003 ) , in which the redward asymmetry of the scattering cross section around ly@xmath0 was briefly illustrated .",
    "however , spectroscopy is often presented in wavelength space rather than in frequency space so that it will also be useful to express the kramers - heisenberg formula in wavelength space . in this paper",
    ", we present the same expansion in wavelength space and quantify the redward shift of the center wavelength as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , we also expand the kramers - heisenberg formula in the vicinity of ly@xmath3 in order to investigate the asymmetry around ly@xmath3 .    in the case of ly@xmath3",
    ", there is an additional scattering channel , which results from radiative de - excitation into the @xmath23 state re - emitting an h@xmath0 line photon .",
    "this inelastic or raman scattering branch is proposed to be important in the formation of broad h@xmath0 wings observed in young planetary nebulae and symbiotic stars ( e.g. isliker , nussbaumer & vogel 1989 , lee 2000 , schmid 1989 ) . in this paper , we show that the cross section around ly@xmath3 is asymmetric blueward , which is in high contrast with the behavior around ly@xmath0 .",

    "we show the quantities obtained by shifting the lorentzian redward by an amount of @xmath170 .",
    "improvement of the fitting in wing parts is achieved only at the expense of a poor approximation near the line center . in the middle panel ,",
    "we show the lorentzian shifted by @xmath171 , in which the quality of the fit is compromised between the previous two cases .    in the analysis by lee ( 2003 )",
    "the optimal wavelength shift was proposed by @xmath172 , which is smaller than @xmath171 suggested in this work .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that the fitting procedure in lee ( 2003 ) was confined to a rather narrow interval of @xmath173 excluding extreme wing parts .",
    "the procedure of fitting a dla profile using the shifted lorentzian tends to overestimate the line center wavelength of ly@xmath0 leading to corresponding overestimate of the redshift of the dla .",
    "we note that lee ( 2003 ) made a mistake in pointing out that the redshift would be _ underestimated _ , which should be corrected to be _",
    "overestimated_.    a similar analysis corresponding to ly@xmath3 is shown in fig .  7 for the same neutral hydrogen column density @xmath174 .",
    "in the figure , the dotted line in each panel shows the transmission coefficient from the lorentzian function ( top panel ) and shifted lorentzian functions ( middle and bottom panels ) , whereas the solid line shows the exact transmission coefficient computed from the kramers - heisenberg formula .",
    "the amount of wavelength shift blueward of ly@xmath3 is @xmath175 and @xmath176 for the middle and bottom panels , respectively .",
    "as in the case of ly@xmath0 illustrated in fig .  6 , the unshifted lorentzian gives an excellent fit to the core part of the absorption profile whereas the bottom panel shows an improved fit to the wing parts with the loss of fitting quality at the core part .    in fig .",
    "8 , we present the transmission coefficients using the kramers - heisenberg formula and the lorentzian functions around ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath3 in the wavelength interval between 980   and 1400    for a very thick medium with @xmath177 . this kind of an extreme neutral hydrogen column density has been found toward the gamma ray burst grb080607 ( e.g. prochaska et al .",
    "for comparison , we show the transmission coefficients obtained from the lorentzian around ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath3 by the dotted line and the dashed line , respectively . in this highly thick medium ,",
    "the deviation from the lorentzian is quite severe due to the contribution from higher order terms , which prevents one from obtaining satisfactory results by fitting the absorption profiles by a voigt or equivalently a lorentzian function .    in particular , in the wavelength range shown in fig .  8 ,",
    "the local peak transmission is found at @xmath178 , for which @xmath179 .",
    "however , the sum of two lorentzian functions around ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath3 admits a local maximum at @xmath180 .",
    "this shows the inadequacy of using a voigt function for fitting analyses in extended wing parts in the case of very high column density systems .",
    "furthermore , at this high @xmath4 , the blue wing region of ly@xmath0 overlaps with that of the red ly@xmath3 wing , for which full quantum mechanical formula should be invoked for an accurate analysis .",
    "the kramers - heisenberg formula is expanded around ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath3 in order to investigate the asymmetric deviation of the scattering cross section .",
    "a redward asymmetry is seen around ly@xmath0 and a blueward asymmetry is found around ly@xmath3 . for red ly@xmath0 photons the perturbing transitions from @xmath181 states @xmath182 provide a positive contribution to the scattering cross section because they are in the same side as the @xmath90 state in the energy space , resulting in red asymmetry . in the case of ly@xmath3 , rayleigh scattering contributes more than raman scattering by a factor 6.452 .",
    "raman scattering around ly@xmath3 exhibits a red asymmetry like ly@xmath0 because all the perturbing transitions lie higher than the main transition .",
    "however , for rayleigh scattering around ly@xmath3 , the transition from @xmath90 state is the dominant perturbing transition which is less energetic than ly@xmath3 .",
    "this leads to a blue asymmetry in @xmath96 around ly@xmath3 . in an attempt to quantify these asymmetries",
    "we compute the mean wavelengths for which the scattering optical depth becomes a unity or one half for various values of column density @xmath4 .",
    "also we fitted the transmission coefficients for given @xmath4 by shifting the lorentzian function .",
    "peebles ( 1993 ) introduced the formula for resonance scattering cross section around ly@xmath0 @xmath183 which is often used in fitting wing profiles of ly@xmath0 ( e.g. miralda - escude 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the red damping wing of ly@xmath0 is essential to probe the partially neutral intergalactic medium expected around the end of cosmic reionization ( gunn & peterson 1965 , scheuer 1965 , mortlock et al .",
    "2011 ) . neglecting the damping term in the denominator",
    ", this expression yields an expansion in frequency space @xmath184.\\ ] ] in this expression , the coefficient of the first order term is 4 , which differs significantly from the correct value of @xmath66 . according to this formula , the scattering cross section is larger in the blue part of ly@xmath0 than in the red part , which is incorrect .",
    "the discrepancy in the expansion may be traced to the approximation adopted in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ peebles ] ) , where the hydrogen atom is effectively treated as a two level system .",
    "the lorentzian or voigt profile matches the kramers - heisenberg profile excellently only in the core part .",
    "therefore , the redshift will be measured reliably when the profile fitting is more weighted toward deeply absorbed core part than far wing parts . with the accurate determination of the redshift and column density of the dla , one may obtain reliable transmission coefficients using the kramers - heisenberg formula or its first order approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ lya_wv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ lybeq3 ] ) .    in an analysis of a quasar spectrum , it is highly difficult to obtain the accurate continuum level due to intervening ly@xmath0 forest systems .",
    "securing the quasar continuum level around the damped ly@xmath0 center with high precision is critical to verify the asymmetry presented in this work . with the advent of extremely large telescopes in the near future equipped with a high resolution spectrometer",
    "the accurate atomic physics will shed light on the physical conditions of neutral hydrogen reservoir in the early universe .",
    "the author is very grateful to the anonymous referee whose comments greatly improved the presentation of this paper .",
    "this research was supported by the basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) funded by the ministry of education , science and technology ( 2011 - 0027069 ) .",
    "we show a detailed angular integration of the matrix element that constitute the kramers - heisenberg formula . because of the selection rule of the electric dipole interaction , the relevant states are @xmath32 and @xmath31 state in the case of rayleigh scattering . in the case of raman scattering relevant to the interaction around ly@xmath3 , @xmath23 state",
    "is also involved . however , as long as the anglular and polarization average is concerned , the same calculation is performed .    a typical matrix element to be summed in the kramers - heisenberg formula is @xmath185 where @xmath30 denotes an intermediate state . in particular , @xmath30 can be written as @xmath40 , where @xmath186 is the magnetic quantum number taking one of zero and @xmath187 in the case of a @xmath2-state .",
