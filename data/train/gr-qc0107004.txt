    "over thirty years ago misner @xcite suggested that the observed large scale isotropy of the universe is due to the action of the neutrino viscosity which was effective when the universe was about one second old .",
    "dissipative bulk viscous type thermodynamical processes are supposed to play a crucial role in the dynamics and evolution of the early universe .",
    "there are many processes capable of producing bulk viscous stresses in the early cosmological fluid like interaction between matter and radiation , quark and gluon plasma viscosity , different components of dark matter , particle creation , strings and topological defects etc . @xcite .",
    "traditionally , for the description of these phenomena the theories of eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite were used . but israel @xcite and israel and stewart @xcite have shown that the eckart - type theories suffer from serious drawbacks concerning causality and stability . regardless of the choice of equation of state ,",
    "all equilibrium states in these theories are unstable and in addition signals may be propagated through the fluid at velocities exceeding the speed of light .",
    "these problems arise due to the first order nature of the theory i.e. it considers only first - order deviations from the equilibrium .",
    "the neglected second - order terms are necessary to prevent non - causal and unstable behavior .    a relativistic consistent second - order theory was found by israel @xcite and developed into what is called transient or extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , the best currently available theory for analyzing dissipative processes in the universe is the full israel - stewart - hiscock causal thermodynamics .",
    "exact general solutions of the field equations for flat homogeneous universes filled with a full causal viscous fluid source for a power - law dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient on the the energy density have been obtained recently in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to obtain the general solution of the gravitational field equations for the case of a bulk viscous cosmological fluid , with the bulk viscosity coefficient proportional to the energy density , obeying the zeldovich ( stiff ) equation of state . in this case",
    "the solution can be presented in an exact parametric form .",
    "the behavior of the scale factor , deceleration parameter , viscous pressure , viscous pressure - thermodynamic pressure ratio , comoving entropy and ricci and kretschmann invariants is also considered .",
    "for a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with a line element @xmath0 filled with a bulk viscous cosmological fluid the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy density , @xmath3 the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath4 the bulk viscous pressure and @xmath5 the four velocity satisfying the condition @xmath6 .",
    "we use units so that @xmath7 .",
    "the gravitational field equations together with the continuity equation @xmath8 imply @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the causal evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure is given by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temperature , @xmath13 the bulk viscosity coefficient and @xmath14 the relaxation time .",
    "( [ bulk ] ) arises as the simplest way ( linear in @xmath4 ) to satisfy the @xmath15 theorem ( i.e. , for the entropy production to be non - negative , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the entropy flow vector , @xmath18 is the entropy per particle and @xmath19 is the particle flow vector ) @xcite , @xcite .    in order to close the system of equations ( [ field ] ) we have to give the equation of state for @xmath3 and specify @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath20 . as usual , we assume the following phenomenological laws @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants",
    "( [ csi ] ) are standard in cosmological models whereas the equation for @xmath20 is a simple procedure to ensure that the speed of viscous pulses does not exceed the speed of light .",
    "the requirement that the entropy is a state function imposes in the present model the constraint @xmath27 @xcite so that @xmath28 for @xmath22 .",
    "the growth of the total comoving entropy @xmath29 over a proper time interval @xmath30 is given by @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the boltzmanns constant .",
    "the israel - stewart - hiscock theory is derived under the assumption that the thermodynamical state of the fluid is close to equilibrium , that is the non - equilibrium bulk viscous pressure should be small when compared to the local equilibrium pressure @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "if this condition is violated then one is effectively assuming that the linear theory holds also in the nonlinear regime far from equilibrium .",
    "for a fluid description of the matter , the condition ought to be satisfied .    to see if a cosmological model inflates or not it is convenient to introduce the deceleration parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the positive sign of the deceleration parameter corresponds to standard decelerating models whereas the negative sign indicates inflation .    with these assumptions",
    "the evolution equation for flat homogeneous causal bulk viscous cosmological models is @xmath35    by introducing a set of non - dimensional variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 by means of the transformations @xmath38 , with @xmath39 and using the expression of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 , eq .",
