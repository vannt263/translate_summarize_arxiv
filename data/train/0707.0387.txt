    "thus , from the dijkgraaf - vafa conjecture , we can infer that the massey product in the @xmath0 category @xmath232 matches one of @xmath233 as a partition function , and under dijkgraaf - vafa conditions , the number of degrees of freedom of the d - branes matches one of the seiberg - witten moduli because of the reason given above .",
    "there are natural correspondences between bps monopole states and their deformations in moduli space , and b - branes and their chan - paton factors , i.e. , open strings .",
    "this evidence leads to this article s formulation .      here , to clarify the relation between matrix model and open string fields theory , we detail the background of the above dijkgraaf - vafa conjecture as a large-@xmath1 reduced matrix model .",
    "@xcite we review large @xmath1 reduced matrix model description of dijkgraaf - vafa duality according to ref .",
    "3 .    in this section",
    ", we need the action of noncommutative @xmath208 gauge theory for the gauge potential @xmath234 also denoted by @xmath235 coupled to fermion @xmath236 in the adjoint representation : @xcite @xmath237 ^ 2+\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}[\\mathscr{a}^{\\mu},\\psi]).\\ ] ]    as proved in ref .",
    "3 , this action is able to be extended to the action of a supermatrix model with chiral superfields @xmath11 as chan - paton factors on d - branes in a large-@xmath1 reduced model described by the supertrace of supermatrix @xmath238 , for noncommutativity of coordinates @xmath239 on noncommutative space which satisfy @xmath240=2i\\gamma\\sigma^3 $ ] , and superpotential @xmath205 as @xmath241    the notation @xmath242 denotes that this action @xmath243 is a holomorphic term of one of a background large-@xmath1 ( twisted ) reduced model composed of matrices @xmath11 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 . these components correspond to adjoint matter superchiral ( anti-)fields , gauge fields and field strengths .",
    "@xcite    this action @xmath243 is equivalent to the action of the original dijkgraaf - vafa theory of an ordinary one matrix model , @xmath247 .",
    "next , we explain the correspondence between the d - branes system and a matrix variable in a large-@xmath1 reduced matrix model . essentially , the situation does not change in a super large-@xmath1 reduced matrix model .    in the bosonic matrix @xmath235 , coordinates of d - branes are diagonal elements @xmath248 of matrix @xmath235 .",
    "then , nondiagonal elements @xmath249 of @xmath235 are open strings running from d - brane @xmath250 to d - brane @xmath248 .    according to ref .",
    "31 , this latter conclusion is justified by the following .",
    "we consider an hermitian matrix @xmath235 of a field perpendicular to a d - brane in this matrix model .",
    "if @xmath251 is a variable of a string field , its mass is proportional to the length between d - branes @xmath252 and @xmath253 . in field theory",
    ", this mass is proportional to a coefficient of @xmath254 in the action . in the above action , the potential term @xmath255 ^ 2 $ ] is proportional to @xmath256 , for the vacuum expectancy @xmath257 .    from the above",
    ", we define the dijkgraaf - vafa reduction @xmath258 .",
    "firstly , this does not change the kp / toda @xmath90 function : @xmath259    secondly , this transforms the alteration domains of the kp / toda @xmath90 function from the hilbert space of a one matrix model through the transformation of its spectral sets @xmath260 to another alteration domain , the second quantized hilbert space of the toda lattice integrable system , @xmath261 @xcite @xmath262    we shall define the elements of hilbert space @xmath261 in sec.3.3 as the hilbert space @xmath263 of one matrix variable solutions of the covariant equation .    by summarizing the first statement in the introduction and @xmath0-enhanced homological mirror symmetry @xmath264,@xcite we formularize topological open string field theory as an algebraic equation containing two types of higher composition matrix in @xmath0-enhanced - derived @xmath0 categories @xmath265 and @xmath266 , as mentioned in sec.2.1 .",
    "the equation of homological mirror symmetry for topological planar open string field theories satisfies the following three physical conditions .    1 .",
    "it stands for perturbation of any degree @xmath167 .",
    "it stands for any strong / weak coupling constant .",
    "it includes gravity / gauge theory duality .",
    "@xmath267    we write eq.(48 ) using @xmath268 not @xmath202 since this formula describes the equivalence between two @xmath0 algebras of higher composition structures which satisfy eq.(4 ) and eq.(5 ) in each @xmath0 category .    in eq.(48 )",
    ", we let @xmath12 be a matrix variable in the chern - simons one matrix model proposed in ref .",
    "33 which describes the mirror contents of @xmath11 , and satisfy the condition @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is a matrix variable in a one matrix model which satisfies the conditions of the dijkgraaf - vafa conjecture .",
    "we note that in the mirror symmetry involution @xmath271 , eigenvalues are not always conserved .",
    "for example , generally the a - brane and the corresponding b - brane have different dimensions and configurations to each other.@xcite    it is shown in ref .",
    "33 that the partition function of the chern - simons one matrix model with the action @xmath272 matches the partition function of the topological open string a - model : @xmath273 furthermore , in the situation of the chern - simons one matrix model , the @xmath53-th eigenvalue @xmath274 of the matrix variable @xmath12 describes the measure of the @xmath53-th a - brane , i.e. , the variable of the @xmath53-th sphere on the mirror manifold of resolved conifold.@xcite thus , in eq . ( 48 ) , we let @xmath275 denote the partition function @xmath276",
    ".    we can easily check that eq.(48 ) satisfies the above three conditions .",
    "condition ( ) is realized by the @xmath0 relations of eq . ( 4 ) and eq . ( 5 ) on the partition functions of the @xmath0 categories @xmath34 and @xmath9 .    condition ( )",
    "is realized by @xmath277-duality on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 48 ) as the modularity of @xmath90 functions from @xmath128 symmetries of seiberg - witten curves , and on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 48 ) as mirror symmetry between the a - model and b - model in untwisted type b string theory which reduces the left - hand side to the right - hand side .",
    "@xcite    equation .",
    "( 48 ) is a multi - linear equation describing the sector of open string fields from the definition of product structures of @xmath0 algebras .",
    "to conclude , we review the contents of this article from the view point of gravity / gauge theory duality . as seen in the gopakumar - vafa duality on deformed / resolved conifolds,@xcite in the planar limit , the open string world sheet becomes the closed string decoupled world sheet . in this article",
    ", we formulate the b - model side of this phenomenon .",
    "homological mirror symmetry is originally defined on a d - branes system attached by open strings .",
    "the planar limited version implies the mirror symmetry of decoupled closed strings and we formulate this version by using homotopy associative algebra .",
    "then , categorical formulation should satisfy following conditions .    1 .",
    "as objects , d - branes are reread as symplectic bases on @xmath181 , @xmath2 seiberg - witten type curves .",
    "2 .   as morphisms , closed string fields are related to open string fields by the large @xmath1 duality .",
    "the product structures satisfy @xmath0 algebras that originate in topological gravity .",
    "the physical background geometric transition in the dijkgraaf - vafa conjecture satisfies condition @xmath278 .",
    "@xcite in this article we retained the mathematical formulation a - model side on the mirror manifold of resolved conifold , but , physically this is not same as but rather analogous to the gopakumar - vafa duality .",
    "therefore , the gravity / gauge theory duality is considered to be fundamental to solving planar homological mirror symmetry .",
    "the author wishes to thank professor toshiya kawai for valuable discussions and instruction , professor tohru eguchi for valuable comments , professor shu - ichiro inutsuka and professor hikaru kawai for their kindness , and especially yoshitaka yamamoto for continuous encouragement and kindness throughout the years spent preparing this article .",
    "in this appendix , we refer to the physical aspects of @xmath0 structure of open string fields theory .      for hilbert space of cubic open string field @xmath280 ,",
    "the higher composition structure @xmath45 is given for brst charge @xmath40 and reflector operator @xmath281 with indices of two open string disks connecting points @xmath282 and @xmath283 that satisfy @xmath284 and @xmath167-vertex @xmath285 geometrical disk @xmath50 with marked @xmath53 points in this order on the boundary as follows , @xmath286 @xmath287 then , @xmath288 forms an @xmath0 algebra .",
    "the sketch of the proof of the associativity is as follows .",
    "first we apply the brst charge @xmath40 to @xmath289 and from the leibniz rule , there emerges two terms such that @xmath40 acts to out going @xmath167-vertex or in coming open string fields .",
    "we calculate these terms using the cyclic rule for @xmath167-vertex @xmath290 the @xmath58-loop open string world sheet is a disk having all perturbation degrees , and thus has these cyclic constraints . as a result of the calculation detailed in ref .",
    "38 , the @xmath167-th higher composition of open string fields homotopy associative algebra is written by degree @xmath167 disk amplitudes .",
    "finally , we comment on the above representation of product structure which becomes the kdv @xmath90 function on the resolved conifold using the description of b - model coherent open string fields by bosonic fields as detailed in ref . 39 .",
    "this fact suggests the main statement truly describes open string field theory on a resolved conifold .",
