    "hydrodynamic analogues of quantum wave - particle duality have attracted considerable attention during the past decade  @xcite .",
    "this started with the relatively recent discovery of the phenomenon of a `` walker ''  @xcite , formed by a droplet that is periodically bouncing above the surface of a vertically vibrated liquid . in a suitable regime of the parameters that characterize the vertical vibration ,",
    "this droplet starts to move horizontally as a consequence of its interaction with the surface waves that it creates during the bouncing . while this horizontal motion is uniform in a homogeneous liquid , it becomes significantly perturbed in the vicinity of boundaries or sub - surface obstacles , due to total or partial reflection of the emitted surface waves , giving rise to irregular trajectories of the droplet . in a pioneering experiment conducted by couder and fort  @xcite ,",
    "such droplets were individually launched at obstacles that contained one or two slits across which the droplets could pass .",
    "monitoring the positions of the droplets that had managed to pass this single or double - slit configuration yielded similar single - slit diffraction and double - slit interference patterns as the ones well known from quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "subsequent experiments yielded other hydrodynamic analogs of quantum phenomena , such as tunneling  @xcite , orbit quantization  @xcite , and landau levels  @xcite .    while there",
    "exist many classical analogs of quantum wave interference phenomena , in particular in the electrodynamic context ( such as anderson localization  @xcite and weak localization  @xcite in disordered systems ) , walking droplets are recognized as the first and , to our knowledge , still unique classical analog of quantum _ wave - particle duality_. indeed , in the context of the double - slit experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite individual droplets are observed to walk through only one of the two slits within the obstacle , and yet the interference fringes observable in their final probability distribution clearly reflect that the motion of the droplets was influenced by the presence of the other slit .",
    "this is very similar to quantum interference experiments with molecules  @xcite although in this case the entire trajectories of the particles can not be observed without affecting the final probability distribution .",
    "it is thought that the reason for the interference resulting from the trajectories of many single droplets is that , unlike the droplet itself , the droplet s associated surface wave passes through both slits , and it is this subsequent wave which guides the droplet into a trajectory which results in interference .",
    "these phenomena of a particle ( droplet ) as a source of waves and that particle being _ piloted _ by a wave ( not necessarily originating from the particle ) is strongly reminiscent of de broglie s two solutions interpretation of quantum mechanics  @xcite which was later reformulated by bohm  @xcite into a usable theory which is expected to reproduce all of the features of quantum mechanics .    from a quantitative point of view , however , this novel classical analogy of quantum wave - particle duality in the bouncing droplet system is not at all evident , and there are many arguments that one can raise against it . while bohmian quantum mechanics exhibits nonlocal features  @xcite , the evolution of the droplet and the surface waves is rooted in hydrodynamics which is manifestly a local theory , unless incompressibility is assumed . in the de broglie - bohm interpretation ,",
    "the specific trajectory of the quantum particle does not back - act onto the evolution of the wavefunction , whereas the droplet creates new surface waves at the position where it bounces .",
    "those surface waves do evolve , to a very good approximation , according to a linear theory , but a direct mapping to the schrdinger equation is not obvious .",
    "the force on a quantum particle in the de broglie - bohm interpretation flows directly from the schrdinger equation and so lack of an equivalent mapping in the droplet system will also lead to a lack of an equivalent mapping to the force on a droplet . in view of these concerns , it may even appear surprising that so many close analogies with quantum mechanics were reported in the above - cited droplet experiments  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to elaborate , on the basis of numerical simulations , why and to which extent this striking analogy exists between the classical droplet system and the behavior of a quantum particle as far as the _ observable phenomenology _ is concerned . we shall particularly focus on single - slit diffraction and double - slit interference as in the experiments of ref .",
    "we shall make use of theories for the motion of the droplet and the evolution of the surface wave that have proved their validity in an experimental context  @xcite .",
    "we shall , moreover , consider several idealizations ( such as a very large `` memory ''  @xcite of the surface wave as far as previous bounces of the droplet are concerned ) and discuss to which extent one can relax those constraints while still observing quantum - like phenomena with good visibility .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe an idealized hydrodynamic model of the bouncing droplet system and compare some features of the model to quantum mechanics .",
    "we first , in sec .  [",
    "sec : force ] , characterize the force on a droplet and explore the analogy of this hydrodynamic force and wave to a bohmian pilot wave and quantum force .",
    "we then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : walker ] , describe the surface wave excited by a bouncing walking droplet . in sec .",
    "[ sec : slits ] we propose a possible mechanism underlying the diffraction and interference of the single and double - slit experiments of ref .",

    "[ sec : force ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "here we develop a model for the bouncing droplet system that will serve as a base for comparisons to quantum theory .",
    "the droplet and the wave it excites are both macroscopically distinct entities and must be described separately .",
    "the droplet experiences a newtonian force and the wave , which is updated by the bouncing of the droplet , obeys a wave equation .",
    "we can draw parallels from this to quantum mechanics using the de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics  @xcite in which a quantum particle is understood as a point - like object absent of all properties besides position .",
    "its motion is guided by a quantum force derived from the wave function , @xmath0 , associated with the particular experiment and which evolves according to the standard schrdinger equation .",
    "therefore a description of the forces on the droplet and the surface wave in the bath will allow direct comparisons to the quantum fore on a particle and the wave function in the de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is well understood  @xcite that the droplet s velocity between bounces will change in proportion to the angle of the surface wave at the point where the droplet impacts it .",
    "we can therefore follow couder and fort  @xcite and relate the change of velocity , due to an impact with the bath , to the gradient of the surface wave immediately before the impact and at the point of impact as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the height of the surface wave with positive values opposite the direction of gravity . taking into account that the acceleration @xmath3 is proportional to the change in velocity @xmath4 , and adding a viscous damping term , @xmath5 , the average newtonian force on the droplet over a bouncing period takes the simple form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the droplet , and @xmath8 is a force proportionality constant .    typically in experiment",
    "the mass of the droplet is on the order of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the maximum value for the magnitude of the total force to be on the order of @xmath10  @xcite . using a maximum surface wave amplitude of @xmath11 and a typical faraday wavelength of @xmath12  @xcite we estimate the maximum value for the gradient of the surface wave , @xmath13 , to be approximately @xmath14 , leading to a value for the force pre - factor @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , the viscous damping term is on the order of @xmath16  @xcite , and must be accounted for in order to avoid unrealistically large velocities for the droplet .",
    "we can now explore a possible analogy between the excited surface wave @xmath17 and the quantum wave function @xmath0 .",
    "to do so we formulate the action of the wave function on the particle , by way of the madelung transformation  @xcite , into a newtonian potential , bohm s quantum potential  @xcite , @xmath18 which inserted into newton s equation , @xmath19 gives rise to all the uniquely quantum behavior seen in quantum systems . to demonstrate the differences between this quantum force derived from the wave function and the hydrodynamic force from eq .",

    "[ fig : forcecomparison](a ) .",

    "( [ eqn : quantforce ] ) .",
    "we can immediately see from fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecomparison ] that there is no mapping between the forces resulting from the quantum wave function @xmath0 and the height of the surface wave @xmath17 . indeed , looking at the behavior of the quantum force ,",
    "[ fig : forcecomparison](b ) , whenever the probability density is close to zero , the quantum force becomes singular and will very quickly remove any particle in the area .",
    "conversely , the hydrodynamic force directs the droplet into the trough of the wave as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecomparison](a ) .",
    "the effect of the the forces from the two guiding equations is analogous if we consider those areas of the effective surface wave with large slope to be equivalent to areas of low probability in the quantum wavefunction .",
    "both forcing equations apply a strong force that will remove a particle from an area of low probability ( high slope ) .",
    "further , because the force and likely therefore the velocity of the droplet in an area of low probability ( high slope ) is large , the droplet will spend less time in that area and be less likely to be found there .",
    "as it stands , we should instead define the surface wave of the droplet as a _ potential _",
    "@xmath20 , which then permits direct comparison to bohm s quantum potential @xmath21 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcecomparison](b ) ) .",
    "it can then be noticed that the two potentials that give rise to the quantum and hydrodynamic forces forces are relatively dissimilar .    ) , along an arbitrary surface wave ( solid line ) .",
    "( b ) the arrows depict the relative magnitudes and direction of the force on a quantum particle calculated from bohm s quantum potential , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : qmp ] ) , along an probability density ( solid line ) with the same form as in ( a ) .",
    "the dashed line is bohm s quantum potential in arbitrary units .",
    "note that at the points where the probability is zero the force on the particle is infinite .",
    "note that the droplet is encouraged to move towards the trough of the wave and the quantum force is singular at zero probability .",
    "the forces derived from the wave function and the surface wave are fundamentally different but can still lead to a probabilistic analogy . ]      consider a walking droplet bouncing on a vibrating surface with a constant droplet speed on the order of @xmath22  @xcite , which is on the order of one tenth the phase velocity of an excited wave  @xcite . due to the low velocity of the droplet compared to the phase velocity of the faraday wave it excites , we can approximate the excited faraday wave due to a bounce of a droplet as a spatially non - local wave . because of the energy imparted to the bath by the vibrator , this faraday wave excited by the bounce of the droplet is made to persist with a lifetime @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the non - local wave that builds up after @xmath24 bounces of the droplet is a sum of standing waves with temporally decaying amplitudes given by  @xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the amplitude of the excited surface wave after @xmath24 bounces , @xmath27 is the amplitude after one bounce , @xmath28 is the time of the @xmath29th bounce , @xmath30 is equal to the total evolution time of the surface wave , @xmath31 is the angular frequency of the surface wave , @xmath32 is its wave number and is on the order of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the position of the droplet at the @xmath29th bounce with @xmath37 being the constant velocity of a walking droplet and @xmath38 the position of the droplet at the first bounce .",
    "the lifetime @xmath23 of an excited surface wave increases with increasing amplitude of the vibrator and will theoretically increase indefinitely the closer the driving is tuned to the faraday threshold , the point at which the surface becomes unstable . because we are dealing with a known characteristic bouncing period , the faraday period @xmath39 , it is more convenient to express the lifetime @xmath23 in terms of it .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the dimensionless memory parameter @xmath40 which is equivalent to the number of bounces of the droplet the bath will store .",
    "this memory parameter permits us to transform the temporal damping function in eq .",

    "the walking droplet bounces synchronously with the vibrator  @xcite and therefore only interacts with the surface wave _ stroboscopically_. from one bounce to the next one time is incremented by @xmath45 and so we can restrict the consideration to those times at which the droplet interacts with the bath , @xmath46 .",
    "we can , therefore , drop the value of the explicitly time dependent part of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : damped_intitial ] ) as @xmath47 , which results in @xmath48 this is a similar equation as the the one given in  @xcite where we differ by not using the asymptotic expansion of the bessel function and neglecting the spatial damping term due to the viscosity of the fluid . the horseshoe shaped surface wave depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wavefront3d ] is typical of a walker and is commonly seen in experiment  @xcite . as can be seen the shape of the wave behind the droplet is quite complex , but as we are studying diffraction and interference , we note that it is only the front of the wave which will impinge on a slit as the droplet approaches the slit .",
    "we can , therefore , disregard the complexity and focus only on the forward part of the surface wave .",

    "this , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] , is due to the difference between the quantum and the hydrodynamic force equation . unlike the quantum case",
    "there is never an area of the surface wave in which a particle will have zero probability of being encountered .",
    "there is also a minimal amount of memory required for interference fringes to appear at all , in contrast to quantum interference in which the the visibility will smoothly approach zero as the which path information approaches one .",
    "we note that while we still require the system to be in the high memory regime to build up the post - slit surface wave responsible for the single droplet interference , we have not imposed such a restriction after the droplet has passed the slit .",
    "in summary , we have numerically investigated single - slit diffraction and double - slit interference using droplets and compared the results to the predictions of the de broglie - bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics . in order to be as close to this quantum interpretation as possible we have utilized a hydrodynamic model that neglects back - action of the droplet onto the surface wave after the droplet has passed the slit configuration , which corresponds to being in a high memory regime . by way of monte carlo simulations based upon this model , we obtained diffraction and interference patterns in the angular probability distributions of the droplet trajectories that strongly resemble those reported by couder and fort  @xcite and that reflect a striking resemblance to quantum single - slit diffraction and double - slit interference on a phenomenological level .",
    "however , we also identified evident differences from quantum mechanics , such as an imperfect fringe visibility which would not be present for a quantum particle .",
    "these differences are ultimately traced back to the fundamentally different nature of the bohmian force upon a quantum particle as compared to the force that the surface wave exerts upon a droplet . in view of this , it is not obvious to what extent the present classical analogy of quantum wave - particle duality can be maintained in more complex situations involving , e.g. , more than one droplet .",
