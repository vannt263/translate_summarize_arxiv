    "the aim of this paper is to define , analyze and possibly accustom new distributions in @xmath0 .",
    "they are defined with a help of two one - dimensional distributions that first appeared recently , partially in noncommutative context and are defined through infinite products .",
    "that is why it is difficult to analyze them straightforwardly using ordinary calculus .",
    "one has to refer to some extent to notations and results of so called @xmath1series theory .",
    "however the distributions we are going to define and examine have _ purely commutative , classical probabilistic meaning_. they appeared first in an excellent paper of boejko et al .",
    "@xcite as a by product of analysis of some non - commutative model . later they also appeared in purely classical context of so called one - dimensional random fields first analyzed by w. bryc at al . in @xcite and @xcite . from these papers we can deduce much information on these distributions .",
    "in particular we are able to indicate sets of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to measures defined by these distributions . those are so called @xmath1hermite and al - salam - chihara polynomials - a generalizations of well known sets of polynomials .",
    "thus in particular we know all moments of the discussed one - dimensional distributions .",
    "what is interesting about distributions discussed in this paper is that many of their properties resemble similar properties of normal distribution .",
    "as stated in the title we consider three families of distributions , however properties of one , called multidimensional @xmath1normal , are main subject of the paper .",
    "the properties of the remaining two are in fact only sketched .",
    "all distributions considered in this paper have densities .",
    "the distributions in this paper are parametrized by several parameters .",
    "one of this parameters , called @xmath4 belongs to @xmath5 $ ] and for @xmath6 the distributions considered in this paper become ordinary normal .",
    "two out of three families of distributions defined in this paper have the property that all their marginals belong to the same class as the joint , hence one of the important properties of normal distribution .",
    "conditional distributions considered in this paper have the property that conditional expectation of a polynomial is also a polynomial of the same order - one of the basic properties of normal distributions .",
    "distributions considered in this paper satisfy gebelein inequality -property discovered first in the normal distribution context .",
    "furthermore as in the normal case lack of correlation between components of a random vectors considered in the paper lead to independence of these components . finally conditional distribution @xmath7 considered in this paper can be expanded in series of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a marginal density , @xmath10 are orthogonal polynomials of @xmath9 and @xmath11 are also polynomials . in particular if @xmath12 that is when instead of conditional distribution of @xmath13 we consider only distribution of @xmath14 then @xmath15 . in this case",
    "such expansion formula it is a so called poisson - mehler formula , a generalization of a formula with @xmath16 being ordinary hermite polynomials and @xmath17 that appeared first in the normal distribution context .    on the other hand one of the conditional distributions that can be obtained with the help of distributions considered in this paper",
    "is in fact a re - scaled and normalized ( that is multiplied by a constant so its integral is equal to @xmath18 ) askey - wilson weight function .",
    "hence we are able to prove some properties of this askey - wilson density .",
    "in particular we will obtain a generalization of poisson - mehler expansion formula for this density .    to define briefly and swiftly these one - dimensional distributions that will be later used to construct multidimensional generalizations of normal distributions ,",
    "let us define the following sets @xmath19 & if & \\left\\vert q\\right\\vert < 1 \\\\   \\left\\ { -1,1\\right\\ } & if & q=-1% \\end{array}% \\right . .\\]]let us set also @xmath20 and @xmath21 if @xmath22 . sometimes to simplify notation we will use so called indicator functions @xmath23 the two one - dimensional distributions ( in fact families of distributions ) are given by their densities .",
    "the first one has density:@xmath24defined for @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "we will set also @xmath27for @xmath28 considered distribution does not have density , is discrete with two equal mass points at @xmath29 .",
    "since this case leads to non - continuous distributions we will not analyze it in the sequel .",
    "the fact that such definition is reasonable i.e. that distribution defined by @xmath30 tends to normal @xmath31 as @xmath32 will be justified in the sequel .",
    "the distribution defined by @xmath33 @xmath34 will be referred to as @xmath35normal distribution .",
    "the second distribution has density :    @xmath36    defined for @xmath25 @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "it will be referred to as @xmath40conditional normal , distribution .",
    "for @xmath6 we set    @xmath41    ( in the sequel we will justify this fact ) . notice that we have @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "the simplest example of multidimensional density that can be constructed from these two distribution is two dimensional density @xmath44that will be referred to in the sequel as @xmath45 and two parameters .",
    "one playing similar rle to parameter @xmath46 in two - dimensional normal distribution .",
    "the other parameter @xmath47 has a different rle . in particular",
    "it is responsible for modality of the distribution and of course it defines its support .    as stated above , distribution defined by @xmath30 appeared in 1997 in @xcite in basically non - commutative context .",
    "it turns out to be important both for classical and noncommutative probabilists as well as for physicists .",
    "this distribution has been accustomed i.e. equivalent form of the density and methods of simulation of i.i.d .",
    "sequences drawn from it are e.g. presented in @xcite .",
    "distribution @xmath48 although known earlier in nonprobabilistic context , appeared ( as an important probability distribution ) in the paper of w. bryc @xcite in a classical context as a conditional distribution of certain markov sequence . in the following section we will briefly recall basic properties of these distributions as well as of so called @xmath1hermite polynomials ( a generalization of ordinary hermite polynomials ) . to do this",
    "we have to refer to notation and some of the results of @xmath1series theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 after recall some of the results of @xmath1series theory we present definition of multivariate @xmath1normal distribution .",
    "the following section presents main result .",
    "the last section contains lengthy proofs of the results from previous section .",
