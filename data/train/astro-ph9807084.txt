    "extended rotation curves of disk galaxies provide the most compelling evidence for the existence of large quantities of dark matter on galactic scales .",
    "their detailed shapes , in addition , offer invaluable clues regarding the spatial structure of the dark component and can be used to gain insight into how the properties of dark halos vary as a function of the observable properties of the galaxies that inhabit them .",
    "one well - known example is the apparent coincidence noticed in early data between the shape of the inner rotation curve and the circular velocity curve expected from the luminous distribution alone .",
    "this was interpreted as indication that disks dominate the gravitational potential near the center and that the dark halo plays a major role only beyond a few exponential disk scalelengths , where the rotation speed stays roughly constant . together with the lack of obvious structural signatures marking the transition between the disk- and halo - dominated regions , this observation fueled speculation of a `` conspiracy '' between the halo and disk mass distributions that results in comparable amounts of dark and luminous material within the galaxy s optical radius ( see , e.g. , bahcall & casertano 1985 , van albada & sancisi 1986 , sancisi & van albada 1987 , freeman 1993 ) .",
    "these early results exerted strong influence on later work , and subsequent modeling of disk galaxy rotation curves focussed on the `` maximum - disk '' hypothesis , which assigns to the disk the largest mass - to - light ratio consistent with velocity measurements in the inner regions .",
    "this hypothesis minimizes the halo contribution and imposes an upper limit on the central density of the halo .",
    "one simple halo model where these constraints are easily implemented is the non - singular isothermal sphere , which became the model of choice in mass decomposition studies based on rotation curve data .",
    "this halo model ( referred to hereafter as the iso model ) , combined with the `` maximum - disk '' hypothesis , has been found to give remarkably good fits to the rotation curves of disk galaxies ( see , e.g. , begeman 1987 , broeils 1992 , and references therein ) .    despite its success in reproducing the observed rotation curves",
    ", this modeling suffers from important shortcomings .",
    "the disk - halo conspiracy hypothesis , for example , has been challenged by rotation curves of larger samples of galaxies that include diffuse dwarfs and compact luminous disks .",
    "these larger datasets have made clear that disk rotation curves come in a variety of shapes , and that only a subset of spirals have `` flat '' rotation curves . in faint galaxies ,",
    "rotation velocities tend to rise slowly and keep rising even beyond the optical radius , whilst in brighter galaxies rotation speeds rise fast to a maximum and level off or sometimes even decline beyond the optical disk . within the context of the iso model , a simple ( but non - unique ) interpretation of this trend is that halos have large `` core radii '' and that the luminous - to - dark mass ratio inside the optical radius increases systematically with luminosity . in faint spirals , disks are relatively unimportant gravitationally and the rotation curve rises tracing the halo potential . on the other hand , in bright , massive spirals the contribution of the disk is close to `` maximum '' and results in more steeply rising , roughly flat rotation curves .",
    "persic and salucci ( 1991 ) seized on these trends and proposed that the shape of the rotation curve is determined solely by the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the study of casertano & van gorkom ( 1991 ) confirmed the strong shape - luminosity dependence but noted that galaxies of similar luminosity have different rotation curve shapes depending on their surface brightness . at a given luminosity ,",
    "galaxies with higher - than - average surface brightness seem to have more steeply rising rotation curves and to show clearer evidence of the disk `` dominance '' than their lower - than - average surface brightness counterparts . together with the fact that luminosity and surface brightness are correlated ( see , eg . , figure 1 below ) this suggests that it is surface brightness rather than luminosity the main responsible for the shape of the rotation curve .",
    "the hypothesis that disks contribute most of the inner circular velocity can also be tested by measuring the thicknesses of disks and their vertical velocity dispersions , which yield an independent measure of the disk mass .",
    "this analysis is perforce statistical in nature , since it is impossible to measure directly these quantities in a single galaxy . in all samples where",
    "this exercise has been carried out , it seems that disks contribute only about @xmath8 of the maximum observed rotation speed ( bottema 1993 , 1997 ) .",
    "a further difficulty with the `` maximum - disk '' hypothesis is that , if disks really control the gravitational potential near the center then two disks of the same mass but different surface density would have different rotation speeds .",
    "this implies that , at fixed luminosity , disks with higher than average surface brightness should rotate faster than the mean , and vice - versa ( under the plausible assumption that stellar mass - to - light ratios are independent of galaxy surface brightness ) .",
    "such trend would show as a second parameter in the tully - fisher relation , and has been ruled out by detailed observational studies ( courteau & rix 1998 ) . unless disk mass - to - light ratios and surface brightness anti - correlate in exactly the way needed to cancel the expected trend",
    ", these observations suggest that disks are not `` maximum '' and that halos contribute a non - negligible fraction of the gravitational potential near the center .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of `` maximum - disk '' plus isothermal halo models is also problematic .",
    "the halo mass distribution is almost certainly modified by the collapse of the luminous disk , so it is difficult to explain how all halos manage to retain their `` isothermal '' shapes _ after _ the disk assembly , especially taking into account that disks come in many different sizes and masses .",
    "if during the formation of the disk the halo mass distribution reacts conserving its adiabatic invariants , then the initial halo configuration must have been hollow , which seems unphysical .",
    "the existence of a core with a well defined central density in the dark matter distribution is in any case hard to justify , since it implies a characteristic feature in the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations on scales where most favored cosmological models would predict a nearly scale - free behavior .    finally , non - singular isothermal spheres are poor fits to the structure of dark halos formed in cosmological n - body simulations , as illustrated by the recent work of navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw96 and nfw97 , respectively ) .",
    "halos formed in hierarchically clustering universes have density profiles that appear to diverge near the center and rule out isothermal halos with constant density cores of the size required to fit the rotation curve data .",
    "the structure of these halos ( hereafter nfw profiles , see eq .",
    "4 below ) shows remarkable similarity , regardless of halo mass , power spectrum of initial density fluctuations , and the value of the cosmological parameters . as in the isothermal sphere ,",
    "only two parameters are needed to describe the halo mass profile : a radial scale ( intimately related to the total mass of the system ) and a characteristic density .",
    "one important advantage of the nfw halo model is that the two free parameters mass and density are now amenable to interpretation , since they are tightly correlated in each cosmological model in a way that reflects the collapse times of systems of different mass .",
    "thus , observational constraints on the characteristic density of halos of a given mass may in principle discriminate between competing cosmological models .    the existence of a well - defined prediction for the structure of dark halos can be used to improve constraints on the relative contribution of dark and luminous mass in disk galaxies by reexamining the detailed shapes of their rotation curves . in this paper",
    ", we use nfw halo profiles to fit the rotation curves of a large sample of galaxies selected from the literature .",
    "the main purpose of this exercise is twofold : ( i ) to verify whether nfw profiles are consistent with the rotation curves of disk galaxies , and ( ii ) to assess what constraints these observations place on cosmological models .",
    "this analysis should also enable us to establish quantitatively the relation between galaxy luminosity and halo mass , a direct indicator of the efficiency of transformation of baryons into stars in systems of different mass , and a crucial ingredient of galaxy formation models .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the compilation of observational data in  2 , and the disk / halo models used to fit the data in  3 .",
    "section 4 discusses the results of applying these models to the data , while  5 discusses our main results in the context of current cosmological models .",
    "a summary of our conclusions is presented in  6 .",
    "we have collected from the literature rotation curves for more than one hundred disk galaxies .",

    "open circles refer to the total luminosity , and crosses to the disk luminosity only .",
    "the very slight difference between the two sets of symbols indicates that our sample contains relatively few galaxies with very massive spheroids .",
    "because luminosity scales with radius more steeply than @xmath15 ( see table 1 ) the average surface brightness increases with luminosity .",
    "this is shown in the top right panel , where we plot the total luminosity as a function of the effective surface brightness of the galaxy , @xmath16 , defined simply as the luminosity of the galaxy divided by the area contained within one disk exponential scalelength , @xmath17 .",
    "this overall measure of the central concentration of the luminous component is straightforward to compute for all galaxies in the sample and is less sensitive than the central surface brightness to the presence of a bulge .",
    "the correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath16 shown in figure 1 is similar to that present in galaxy surveys that are sensitive to low surface brightness galaxies ( impey & bothun 1997 ) and is therefore unlikely to be solely the result of selection effects .",
    "finally , the bottom right panel shows the relation between the luminosity of the galaxy and the specific angular momentum of the disk , estimated by @xmath19 .",
    "the rotation curve data compiled from the literature is inhomogeneous in their spatial coverage and presentation .",
    "the data from mathewson et al ( 1992 ) consist of h@xmath9 velocities along a slit , de - projected , centered and folded following the procedure outlined by persic & salucci ( 1996 ) .",
    "the curves are then smoothed by binning the data in groups of three adjacent data points .",
    "the mean velocity is taken as a measure of the circular velocity at the mean radius of the bin , and the rms velocity dispersion , weighted by the signal - to - noise of each measurement , as an indicator of the uncertainty .",
    "most other rotation curves are derived from 21 cm data and are given in tables of radius vs inclination - corrected rotation speed .",
    "uncertainty estimates in the rotation speed are also usually quoted , although there is no consistent practice for determining the size of these error bars . in some cases",
    "formal errors in the average velocity at each radius from a tilted - ring model are quoted , as given , for example , by the program rotcur ( see , eg . , begeman 1987 ) . in other cases ,",
    "uncertainties are derived by comparing the approaching and receding sides of the curve , under the assumption that the curve should be symmetric relative to the adopted center .",
    "all these estimates are presumably acceptable as rough indicators of the accuracy of the determination of the velocity at each radius , but they are subject to different systematics and may result in different error estimates when applied to the same set of data .",
    "for example , since the error in the mean given by rotcur depends on the number of independent data points available , error bars in the outer parts of the galaxies , which are well resolved in the velocity maps , are usually very small ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "for comparison , the uncertainties in the velocities estimated by assessing deviations from symmetry of the folded curves are typically of order @xmath21 .",
    "what one would really like for fitting mass models to these data are estimates of the uncertainty in the _ circular _ velocity at each radius , something which is in practice much more difficult to determine . for lack of a better alternative",
    ", we have decided to retain the quoted error bars as estimates of the error in the velocity at each radius . in practice",
    ", this means that minimum-@xmath22 values are not robust measures of goodness - of - fit , and that they should be used with caution when assessing the quality of fits to two different galaxies , or when assigning statistical significance to the quantitative results of the fitting procedure ( ie .",
    "fits to two different galaxies may be equally ` good ' even if the @xmath22-values differ greatly ) .",
    "we shall use the computed @xmath22 only to compare the quality of fits to individual galaxies using different halo models .",
    "this we describe in the following section .",
    "we describe here the two mass models that will be used to fit the rotation curve data described in the previous section .",
    "one is the usual analytic approximation to the non - singular `` isothermal '' sphere , and the other the nfw profile proposed by nfw96 and nfw97 .",
    "the contribution of the luminous component will be taken into account assuming that the spheroidal component is well described by a de vaucouleur s profile , and that the disk is exponential .",
    "the parameters of these components are taken from the studies cited above or , when unavailable , computed directly from spheroid / disk fits to the surface photometry . in the interest of simplicity , we shall assume that both disks and spheroids can be characterized by the same mass - to - light ratio . because our sample contains only a few galaxies where the spheroid contributes a significant fraction of the luminous budget , this assumption is unlikely to introduce a severe bias in our analysis .",
    "the approximate fit to the non - singular `` isothermal '' sphere used in most rotation curve studies is a density profile of the form , @xmath23 its contribution to the circular velocity at each radius is given by , @xmath24 .",
    "\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] the circular velocity increases monotonically with radius and tends to a constant ( maximum ) asymptotic velocity , @xmath25 we shall use @xmath26 and @xmath27 as the two free parameters of this model , hereafter referred to as the iso model .",
    "spherically averaged density profiles of halos formed in cosmological n - body simulations of hierarchically clustering universes are well described by scaling the simple formula proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( nfw96 , nfw97 ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a scale radius , @xmath30 is a characteristic ( dimensionless ) density , and @xmath31 is the critical density for closure .",
    "the associated circular velocity profile is given by @xmath32 where @xmath2 is the circular velocity at the virial radius , @xmath33 , defined as the radius within which the inner mean density of the halo is @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the radius in units of the virial radius , and @xmath36 is the `` concentration '' parameter , a dimensionless number related to the characteristic density @xmath30 by @xmath37}. \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] from these definitions , it follows that @xmath38 ad that the mass contained within the virial radius is @xmath39@xmath40 .",
    "thus halo masses scale with circular velocity not unlike disk luminosities scale with rotation speed ( upper - left panel in figure 1 ) .",
    "this suggests a natural origin for the tully - fisher relation , provided that disk rotation speeds trace halo circular velocities and that the stellar mass of the galaxy is approximately proportional to the total mass of the halo .",
    "we shall return to this question in  5 below .",
    "the density profile of eq .",
    "4 differs significantly from the `` isothermal '' sphere parameterized by eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) , especially in its behavior near the center .",
    "@xmath41 increases linearly with radius for the isothermal sphere but only as @xmath42 for the nfw model . also , whilst the velocity in the isothermal sphere converges asymptotically to @xmath26 at large radii , the nfw circular velocity profile has a maximum at @xmath43 , and declines beyond that radius .",
    "both models have the same number of free parameters , a velocity and a radial scale : @xmath44 and @xmath27 for the isothermal sphere and @xmath2 and @xmath45 for nfw .",
    "we shall use @xmath2 and @xmath46 as the two free parameters of the nfw model .",
    "these two parameters are correlated for each cosmological model , reducing to one the number of free parameters of the nfw profile once a cosmological model is adopted .",
    "a simple step - by - step description of how to calculate @xmath46 as a function of @xmath2 in any hierarchically clustering model is given in the appendix of nfw97 .",
    "our modeling assumes that the surface density of the disk is related to the surface brightness by a single parameter , the disk mass - to - light ratio @xmath47 , and that it can be approximated by an exponential form , @xmath48 its contribution to the circular velocity on the plane of the disk is then @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a velocity scale , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are modified bessel functions of order @xmath53 .",
    "the circular velocity contribution peaks at @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and declines rapidly beyond that radius .",
    "the spheroidal ( bulge ) component is assumed spherical and modeled using de vaucouleurs law , @xmath56 the circular velocity contribution of this component is not analytic , but can be easily computed numerically . for simplicity , we have assumed that the mass - to - light ratio of the bulge is the same as that of the disk . in practice",
    "this assumption is of little importance in our analysis , since our sample is heavily biased towards systems with small bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "fits to the rotation curve of each galaxy are constructed by straightforward @xmath22-minimization varying the three relevant parameters : the velocity and radial scales of the halo , and the mass - to - light ratio of the luminous component .",
    "fits using the `` isothermal '' halo model use eq .  2 to specify the contribution of the dark halo .",
    "fits that use the nfw halo model , on the other hand , take into account that the dark matter distribution is likely to be affected by the presence of the luminous component .",
    "this is done by assuming that the disk is assembled slowly so that the adiabatic invariants of the halo particle orbits are conserved and the halo responds `` adiabatically '' to the growth of the disk ( barnes & white 1984 , blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 , flores et al .",
    "1993 ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the radius , @xmath57 , of each halo mass shell after the assembly of the disk is related to its initial radius , @xmath58 , by @xmath59=r_im_i(r_i ) .",
    "\\eqno(12)\\ ] ] here @xmath60 is the mass within radius @xmath58 before disk formation ( found by integrating eq .  4 ) , @xmath61 is the final disk mass within @xmath57 ( found by integrating eq .",
    "8) and @xmath62 is the final dark matter distribution we wish to calculate .",
    "we assume that halo mass shells do not cross during compression , so that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the assumed initial baryon mass fraction chosen to agree with primordial nucleosynthesis calculations ( walker et al .",
    "1991 , copi et al .",
    "1995 ) .    figure 2 shows the results of the fitting procedure applied to two different galaxies , a high surface brightness galaxy , ngc 3198 ( @xmath65 , begeman 1987 ) , and a low surface brightness galaxy , f563 - 1 ( @xmath66 , de blok 1997 ) .",
    "this figure illustrates a number of features that are common to all fits .",
    "the most important is perhaps to note that rotation curve data alone can not be used to discriminate between different halo models .",
    "indeed , in most cases the minimum @xmath22 values obtained with either halo model are very similar , although the parameters assigned to each component vary greatly . for f563 - 1 , we find @xmath67 using the iso model and @xmath68 using the nfw halo .",
    "the disk dominates the central potential if an iso model is adopted but is essentially negligible if an nfw model is chosen .",
    "differences are less dramatic in the case of ngc3198 , where in neither case the maximum contribution of the disk ( at @xmath69 ) exceeds about @xmath70 of the measured velocity .",
    "figure 2 also illustrates clearly that @xmath22 values are of little use taken individually .",
    "because errors in the velocities are estimated in different ways , the @xmath22 is much smaller for f563 - 1 than for ngc 3198 , most likely reflecting how conservative each author is in estimating the size of the error bars rather than a true goodness of fit .",
    "although not meaningful as goodness - of - fit estimators , @xmath22 values obtained using the two halo models described above can still be compared for individual galaxies .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 , where we show minimum @xmath22-values for all galaxies in the sample using the iso and nfw halo models .",
    "most galaxies can be fit almost equally well by either the iso or the nfw model , with a slight tendency for the iso model to give smaller @xmath22 values .",
    "figure 4 shows that the systems for which the nfw model does worse are generally low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the nature of the discrepancy is illustrated in figure 5 , where we show the rotation curves of four of the six systems for which `` good '' ( @xmath71 ) fits can be found for the iso model but not for nfw halos ( @xmath72 ) . as noted by flores & primack ( 1994 ) and by moore ( 1994 ) ,",
    "these tend to be low - surface brightness dwarf galaxies , where the hi rotation velocity near the center rises more steeply ( and levels off more sharply ) than expected in an nfw profile",
    ".    however , it would be premature to conclude that this discrepancy provides irrefutable evidence against the hierarchically clustering model on which the nfw profile is based .",
    "first of all , it is worth noting that the discrepancy , although very significant in terms of @xmath22 values , is actually small , as can be appreciated visually in figure 5 .",
    "indeed , kravtsov et al ( 1998 ) have argued that these data can be reconciled with cuspy nfw - like density profiles if the inner asymptotic slope were slightly shallower than proposed by nfw96 .",
    "shallower profiles are actually expected if supernova - driven winds have played a major role in the formation of these dwarf systems ( navarro , eke & frenk 1995 ) .",
    "other alternatives include , for example , the possibility that hi curves are less accurate tracers of the potential than the formal error bars suggest .",
    "much of the discrepancy between nfw fits and the data come from the inner few bins , where the measured velocities are only a few tens of . in this regime ,",
    "corrections due to the velocity dispersion of the gas and the finite thickness of the disk are fairly uncertain and may mask higher circular velocities than inferred from rotation speeds alone .    a sobering reminder of the sensitivity of rotation curves to adopted inclinations , signal - to - noise , and other intricacies of the data analysis process is provided by the case of ngc 3109 , where there is a second published rotation curve which combines fabry - perot h@xmath9 data in the inner regions with early 21 cm data in the outer parts ( solid circles in upper - left panel of figure 5 , data from carignan 1985 ) .",
    "the shape of the rotation curve derived from this independent dataset is dramatically different from the hi rotation curve , and quite consistent with an nfw halo model .",
    "( an nfw fit with @xmath73 is shown with a dashed line in this panel . ) finally , preliminary analysis of optical rotation curves of a large number of low - surface brightness galaxies shows little evidence for the large discrepancies with nfw profiles present in this dataset ( pickering et al 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "this suggests that independent datasets that combine hi and optical observations are needed in order to assess the true significance of the discrepancy between this handful of galaxies and nfw profiles .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , the parameters of the nfw halo model , @xmath2 and @xmath46 , are correlated in a way that depends sensitively on the cosmological model , so constraints placed on these parameters by rotation curve data translate directly into constraints on cosmological models .",
    "it is therefore unfortunate that rotation curves generally yield only poor constraints on halo parameters .",
    "for example , for the galaxies illustrated in figure 2 , `` acceptable '' fits ( as defined by the condition @xmath74 ) can be obtained for @xmath2 in the range @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the case of ngc 3198 and @xmath2 in the range @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the case of f563 - 1 .",
    "the large parameter range allowed by the data reflects the covariance between parameters in the fit : disk mass can be traded off with halo concentration to obtain similar circular velocity curves .",
    "actually , acceptable fits can be obtained for all galaxies in our sample by setting the disk mass - to - light ratio to zero and varying only the parameters of the halo .",
    "figure 6 illustrates this for the case of ngc 3198 .",
    "here we show _ halo - only _ circular velocity curves ( eq .",
    "5 ) for different values of @xmath46 .",
    "( @xmath2 is chosen so as to match the velocity in the outer region and varies by less than 30% for all the curves shown . )",
    "note that the curve labeled @xmath79 is essentially equivalent to the best - fit shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is clear that adding the disk mass - to - light ratio as a third variable in the fitting procedure would lead to a large indeterminacy in the value of the parameters .",
    "does this mean that it is impossible to derive meaningful cosmological constraints from rotation curve data ?",
    "not necessarily .",
    "one important thing to note in figure 6 is that the value of @xmath46 retrieved from fitting nfw _ halo - only _ models to the data ( hereafter referred to as @xmath80 ) represents a firm _ upper limit _ to the concentration of the halo .",
    "this upper limit applies to a fairly narrow range of halo circular velocities , which is effectively set by the rotation velocity in the outer regions of a galaxy under the plausible assumption that the halo dominates in the outermost regions . referring to figure 6 , halos with @xmath81",
    "could in principle be made consistent with the ngc 3198 data by suitable addition of a massive disk component , but @xmath82 halos result in rotation speeds that are already in excess of the data in the inner regions , even before allowing for the presence of the disk .",
    "these halos can not be made consistent with the data for any reasonable choice of disk potential .",
    "a second important thing to note in figure 6 is that @xmath80 is a good indicator of the overall shape of the rotation curve .",
    "low values of @xmath80 ( @xmath83 ) indicate that the rotation curve rises slowly , and large values of @xmath80 ( @xmath84 ) describe a sharply rising rotation curve that is flat or that may even decline in the outer regions .",
    "this is because the maximum of the rotation curve is reached at @xmath85@xmath86 kpc , so the larger @xmath80 the sharper the rise of the rotation curve and the nearer the center it reaches the `` flat '' region .",

    "the two parameters are highly correlated : low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) have slowly rising rotation curves while high - surface brightness disks ( hsbs ) have steeply rising , flat rotation curves .",
    "a simple interpretation for this correlation is that it signals the increasing gravitational importance of the disk in systems of higher surface brightness . indeed ,",
    "if disks were gravitationally _ unimportant _ in all systems , their rotation curves would just trace the halo potential .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath80 would then be equivalent to the concentration of the halo and would depend very weakly on surface brightness or other galaxy properties ( note the nearly horizontal lines in figure 7 ) .",
    "the @xmath80-@xmath103 correlation suggests that in systems of low surface brightness the luminous component is indeed unimportant and the rotation curve traces the mass distribution of the halo , ie .",
    "@xmath104-@xmath95 . as the surface brightness of the system increases",
    "so does the gravitational importance of the disk .",
    "this modifies the shape of the rotation curve , leading to a steeper inner rise and sharper flattening that is best described by larger values of @xmath80 .",
    "the above discussion implies that we can use the constraints on halo concentrations derived in the previous section , together with the observed correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath16 , to gain insight into disk mass - to - light ratios and the relationship between the halo circular velocity and the rotation speed of the disk . in the analysis that follows",
    "we shall assume that halos form with parameters corresponding to the @xmath100 cdm model shown in figure 7 .",
    "in practice , this means adopting @xmath105 for all halos , independent of mass .",
    "none of the qualitative trends we discuss below are sensitive to this choice , although quantitatively the results would change had we adopted @xmath106 ( ie .",
    "@xmath107 ) instead .",
    "the crucial ingredient of the discussion that follows if that halos of all masses may be described with roughly the same , low ( @xmath108 ) value of the concentration parameter .",
    "what combination of halo masses and disk mass - to - light ratios is required to reproduce the observed @xmath80-@xmath16 relation and the correlations shown in figure 1 ? as an illustration , let us start by assuming that all galaxies have the same stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath109 in the i - band .",
    "the only free parameter in the fit is then the halo circular velocity , @xmath2 , which we fix by matching the measured maximum rotation speed of the disk within the radial range covered by the actual data .",
    "the result of this exercise is shown as dashed lines in figure 10 .",
    "because of our choice of mass - to - light ratio , low - surface brightness ( faint ) disks are gravitationally unimportant , and the rotation curve is dominated by the halo .",
    "the halo circular velocity , on the other hand , does not reach its virial value within the radii where data are available , and @xmath2 must exceed the rotation speed of the disk in order to match the tully - fisher relation .",
    "( halos reach the maximum circular velocity at @xmath110 km s@xmath111 kpc , or @xmath112 kpc for a @xmath113 , @xmath0 km s@xmath5 halo , a radius well beyond the typical radial extent of rotation curves in dwarf systems . )",
    "halos must then be more massive than indicated by a simple extrapolation of the disk rotation speed , and disks represent a very small fraction of the total mass , @xmath114 .",
    "this constant mass - to - light ratio model , however , predicts a much shallower @xmath80-@xmath16 relation than observed , as shown in the top - left panel of figure 10 .    a second illustrative example is provided by the dotted lines in figure 10 , which assume that in all systems the halo circular velocity at the virial radius is the same as the maximum rotation speed measured in the disk , ie .",
    "the only free parameter in this case is the disk mass - to - light ratio , which is again adjusted to match the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the disk now dominates the central potential in most systems and the resulting disk mass - to - light ratios are of order @xmath116-@xmath117 , in good agreement with the results of fits that postulate `` maximal disks '' .",
    "the rotation curve shapes predicted under this assumption are again in poor agreement with the data , as shown by the failure of the @xmath118-@xmath16 relation to match the observed one .    from these two somewhat extreme examples",
    "it is clear that both @xmath47 and the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath119 have to vary systematically with galaxy luminosity ( or surface brightness ) in order to match the relation between @xmath80 and @xmath16 .",
    "solid lines in figure 10 show the result of adjusting @xmath2 and @xmath47 so as to match the observed rotation speeds and rotation curve shapes .",
    "two trends are clearly noticeable .",
    "disk mass - to - light ratios increase systematically with luminosity , from @xmath120 in faint , slow - rotating disks to @xmath121-@xmath122 in the brightest , fastest rotators .",
    "this represents a modest dependence of @xmath123 on luminosity which can be approximated by @xmath124 .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios of the most luminous disks thus approach those typically derived for `` maximum disk '' hypothesis ( begeman 1987 , broeils 1992 ) .",
    "the predicted trend of mass - to - light ratio with luminosity is consistent with the bluer colors of dwarf irregulars compared with those of bright , high - surface brightness spirals , although the amplitude of the variation seems slightly larger than can be accounted for by stellar population synthesis models .",
    "for example , assuming star formation histories that depend exponentially on time and a salpeter initial mass function , the models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) predict ( @xmath125-@xmath126 ) colors of @xmath127 and @xmath128 for models with mass - to - light ratios spanning the range @xmath129-@xmath116 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the color spread from @xmath130 to @xmath131 between late and early type spirals in the data of de jong ( 1995 ) , although his data does not include dwarf irregulars .",
    "metallicity and dust obscuration are just two of the many effects that would have to be carefully taken into account before concluding that the mass - to - light ratios derived from rotation curve fits are indeed inconsistent with the stellar populations of disk galaxies .",
    "such detailed analysis is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "more intriguing is the resulting relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as seen in the top - right panel of figure 10 ( solid line ) , halos of disks with @xmath132 have circular velocities typically higher than @xmath3 , by up to @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "on the other hand , disks that rotate faster than @xmath135 are all predicted to have similar halo circular velocities , @xmath136 . in other words ,",
    "our results imply that disk - dominated galaxies brighter than @xmath137 are all surrounded by halos of approximately the same mass , @xmath138 .",
    "this behavior has been noted by persic & salucci ( 1991 ) , and offers a natural explanation for the puzzling lack of correlation between luminosity and mass found in dynamical studies of binary galaxies and of satellites orbiting bright spirals ( white et al .",
    "1983 , zaritsky et al 1993 , 1997 , zaritsky & white 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that the lack of correlation arises because these samples are restricted to fairly luminous galaxies ( most galaxies in the zaritsky et al sample have @xmath6 ) .",
    "extending these studies to fainter galaxies should uncover evidence that in dwarf systems halos are more massive than indicated by their rotation speeds and that a clear correlation actually exists between luminosity and halo mass in faint spirals .",
    "one interesting corollary of the modeling presented in the previous subsection is that disk galaxies apparently avoid halos more massive than a `` critical '' circular velocity , @xmath136 .",
    "this may be related to the mass fraction attached to the luminous galaxy in systems of different mass . as shown by the solid line in the bottom - right panel of figure 10",
    ", the disk contributes a negligible fraction of the total mass in low mass systems , but this fraction increases steadily as a function of halo mass , exceeding @xmath139 in halos with @xmath136 .",
    "the very steep increase in the mass fraction associated with the luminous galaxy is actually _ required _ by hierarchical galaxy formation models in order to reconcile the different shapes of the halo mass function and the galaxy luminosity function ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 , cole et al 1994 ) .",
    "for example , according to cole et al . , halos with @xmath140 should have assembled less than @xmath141 of their baryons into galaxies .",
    "this fraction increases to @xmath142 for @xmath136 , reflecting the strong dependence of feedback processes on the depth of the potential well ( navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "the dramatic increase with halo mass of the mass fraction attached to galaxies is thus in good agreement with the independent predictions of semianalytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "the large mass fraction attached to galaxies at the center of massive halos suggests a simple interpretation for the lack of disk galaxies in halos that exceed the `` critical '' circular velocity of @xmath143 .",
    "disks that dominate the gravitational potential are subject to global instabilities that can alter profoundly their morphology , turning them into spheroidal or spheroid - dominated systems ( efstathiou , lake & negroponte 1982 , christodoulou , shlosman & tohline 1995 ) .",
    "the gravitational importance of disks depends not only on disk mass but also on size , which is controlled by its angular momentum : disks with angular momenta below a certain threshold would therefore be prone to global instabilities .",
    "mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) have recently argued that disks can survive in nfw halos only if their specific angular momentum , as measured by the rotation parameter @xmath144 is defined as @xmath145 is the binding energy , and @xmath146 is the total mass .",
    "] , exceeds the threshold @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is a factor close to unity .    under the conservative assumption that the disk specific angular momentum does not exceed that of the halo ( see , e.g. , navarro & white 1994 , navarro & steinmetz 1997 )",
    ", the fraction of halos that can host successful disk galaxies can be estimated as the fraction of halos with rotation parameters higher than @xmath149 .",
    "the @xmath144-distribution of dark halos has been carefully studied through n  body simulations ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 , cole & lacey 1996 , see also bartelmann & steinmetz 1996 ) , and there is broad consensus that @xmath144 has an almost universal distribution that depends very weakly on halo mass and cosmological parameters .",
    "the median @xmath144 is @xmath150 , and roughly ninety - per - cent of systems have @xmath151",
    ". thus fewer than one in ten halos with @xmath152 would be viable hosts of disk galaxies .",
    "disk mass fractions exceeding @xmath153 are reached as the halo circular velocity approaches @xmath136 ( figure 10 ) , and turns this into a `` critical '' circular velocity above which disk survival is unlikely .",
    "a simple consistency check is possible on this interpretation : the number density of halos exceeding this critical velocity should be comparable to the number density of luminous , spheroid dominated systems in the local universe .",
    "it is reassuring that this indeed appears to be the case . according to marzke et",
    "al ( 1994 ) , the number density of e / s0 galaxies brighter than @xmath154 is about @xmath155 mpc@xmath156 , which compares well with the number density of systems with @xmath157 , @xmath158 mpc@xmath156 , for the @xmath159 models shown in figure 7 .",
    "we note that the conclusions listed above are sensitive to our choice of cosmological parameters .",
    "halo number densities , for example , scale roughly as @xmath93 and would be much higher in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the agreement between the abundance of massive halos and e / s0 galaxies would not hold in an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath89 ) universe .",
    "furthermore , @xmath160 can not exceed the universal baryon fraction , @xmath161 , which depends on the hubble constant and on the density parameter @xmath93 .",
    "the primordial abundance of the light elements suggests that @xmath162 ( walker et al .",
    "1991 , copi et al 1995 ) , so @xmath160 may not exceed @xmath163 in an einstein - de sitter universe if @xmath164 .",
    "in other words , unless the baryon abundance is high , as in the low-@xmath93 universes favored by rotation curve shapes ( baryon mass fractions scale as @xmath165 ) , even systems where most baryons can collect in a central galaxy would be stable to disk formation .    to summarize , rotation curve shapes",
    "imply that the fraction of baryons that assemble into galaxies is a steep function of halo circular velocity .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that feedback prevents most baryons from condensing into galaxies in low mass halos .",
    "the effectiveness of feedback decreases rapidly with halo mass , and baryons collapse unimpeded in systems more massive than about @xmath166 .",
    "if the universal baryon fraction is high , as is the case in the low - density universes favored by the rotation curve data , global instabilities would prevent the formation of long - lived disk galaxies in massive systems that exceed this critical circular velocity .",
    "the existence of an upper limit for the mass of halos surrounding disk - dominated galaxies places strong constraints on disk sizes and rotation speeds .",
    "these two parameters are linked by the specific angular momentum of the disk which , for simplicity , we shall estimate as that of an exponential disk with a flat rotation curve , @xmath167 .",
    "the simplest assumption is that @xmath168 is proportional to the global specific angular momentum of the halo , @xmath169 where @xmath170 if the halo is modeled as an nfw profile ( mo et al 1997 ) . since @xmath171 is unlikely to exceed unity ( see navarro & steinmetz 1997 , and references therein ) , and very few halos",
    "are expected to have @xmath172 , the condition @xmath173 effectively translates into a maximum specific angular momentum for disks , @xmath174 @xmath175 kpc .",
    "this is in good agreement with the highest specific angular momentum observed in our sample , @xmath176 @xmath175 kpc , as shown in figure 11 .",
    "@xmath175 kpc ( pickering et al 1997 ) , and therefore exceeds our limit by about 60% .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , malin i would correspond to a @xmath177 halo , and should be a very rare system indeed .",
    "the discovery of a large number of systems like malin i would seriously undermine the validity of the conclusions reported here . ]",
    "figure 11 shows data for all galaxies in our sample with open circles , and has been augmented by the galaxies reported by courteau ( 1997 ) , shown as filled circles .    in this interpretation , galaxies with @xmath178 are approximately `` maximal rotators '' , ie .",
    "disks assembled in the highest-@xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) , most massive ( @xmath181 km s@xmath5 ) halos without any loss of angular momentum ( @xmath182 ) . with this assumption the characteristic size of these disks can be estimated directly .",
    "following mo et al ( 1997 , see their eq.28 ) , disk exponential scalelenghts are directly proportional to @xmath144 and the halo virial radius , modulated by factors that depend on the concentration of the halo , on the mass of the disk and on the available angular momentum , @xmath183 where the dimensionless function @xmath184 can be approximated by @xmath185 and we have defined @xmath186 . in `` maximal rotators '' the mass fraction @xmath187 approaches the maximum allowed by the universal baryon fraction , @xmath188 ( assuming @xmath164 and @xmath189 ) . using @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath180 , and",
    "@xmath192 we derive a rough upper limit @xmath14 of @xmath193 kpc .",
    "in order to derive the dependence of this maximum radius on disk rotation speed , we need to know how the halo virial radius ( or its circular velocity @xmath2 ) scales with @xmath3 .",
    "this is shown in the upper - right panel of figure 10 for the data in our sample ( assuming @xmath100 , or @xmath194 ) , and can be parameterized by , ( @xmath195 ) can be obtained by replacing ( @xmath196 km s@xmath5 ) for ( @xmath197 km s@xmath5 ) in eq.(15 ) . ]",
    "@xmath198 using eq.(15 ) , the maximum @xmath199 scales with rotation speed as shown by the solid line labeled @xmath180 in figure 11 .",
    "this line , together with an analogous one computed using the effective minimum in the @xmath144-distribution ( @xmath200 ) should bracket all observed disk galaxies if our interpretation is correct .",
    "this is in good agreement with the data analyzed in this paper and those of courteau s sample , as can be seen in figure 11 .",
    "as mentioned in  5.4 , the distribution of data points in the @xmath201-@xmath3 plane is further constrained by global instabilities which prevent disks from forming in systems with rotation parameters below a certain threshold , @xmath202 .",
    "mo et al ( 1997 ) advocate @xmath148 of order unity , although newer calculations by syer , mao & mo ( 1997 ) and sellwood & moore ( 1998 ) argue for significantly smaller values of @xmath148 . within the context of our discussion , @xmath148 is effectively determined by our assumption that the highest angular momentum disks in our sample are maximal rotators , which implies @xmath203 .",
    "the actual constraint imposed by @xmath149 on the @xmath201-@xmath3 plane depends sensitively on how @xmath187 scales with halo mass .",
    "for example , if all galaxies had the same ( maximum ) @xmath204 , then @xmath205 and all disks would lie on the solid line labeled @xmath180 . on the other hand , a very steep dependence of @xmath187 on @xmath2 , such as that derived in the previous subsection ( see solid line in the bottom - right panel of figure 10 ) , implies an upper limit on rotation speeds of @xmath206 that is essentially independent of disk radius .",
    "this is shown by the curve labeled @xmath149 in figure 11 .",
    "our interpretation thus predicts that the distribution of disk - dominated galaxies in the @xmath14-@xmath3 plane should be confined to within the `` wedge '' determined by the three solid lines in figure 11 .",
    "this implies that the higher the angular momentum the narrower the scatter in the properties of disks , such as rotation speed and scalelenght .",
    "this `` convergence '' in the properties of high-@xmath168 disks seems to apply also to their luminosities : the scatter in luminosity at a fixed @xmath207 decreases towards higher luminosities ( see bottom - right panel in figure 1 ) .",
    "since luminosity and angular momentum scale with distance in different ways , it may be worth investigating whether the spin of bright disk galaxies could actually be used as an accurate distance indicator .",
    "by contrast , the assumptions @xmath208 and @xmath209constant allow galaxies to form anywhere between the two dotted lines in this figure .",
    "( the two lines correspond to @xmath210 , @xmath180 and @xmath211 , respectively . )",
    "galaxies with rotation speeds above @xmath212 and radii above @xmath213 kpc are permitted in this scenario but are not observed .",
    "our modeling thus offers a natural explanation for the existence of an abrupt cutoff in the distribution of disk rotation speeds , a puzzling observation that has so far eluded proper interpretation ( peebles & silk 1990 ) .",
    "we have analyzed the rotation curves of more than 100 disk galaxies taken from the literature in order to examine whether the structure of their surrounding dark halos is consistent with the nfw model proposed by navarro , frenk & white on the basis of cosmological n  body simulations ( nfw96 , nfw97 ) .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 ) the rotation curves of disk galaxies , with the possible exception of a few low - surface brightness dwarf irregulars , are in general consistent with nfw mass profiles .",
    "the disagreement with the rotation curves of the dwarfs , although significant , is not large , and may signal either systematic departures from the nfw shape in dwarf galaxy halos such as those proposed by kravtsov et al ( 1998 ) , or systematic deviations between measured hi velocities and circular velocities near the center of these systems .",
    "\\2 ) the overall shape of the rotation curves can be used to place strong constraints on the characteristic concentrations of halos surrounding disk galaxies .",
    "we find that consistency with observations implies that halos must be less centrally concentrated than expected in the standard cdm scenario , but are roughly consistent with low - density ( @xmath214 ) , flat cdm cosmogonies normalized to match the cmb fluctuations measured by the cobe satellite .",

    "\\4 ) this trend has important implications on disk mass - to - light ratios and halo masses .",
    "i - band disk mass - to - light ratios are predicted to increase weakly but systematically as a function of galaxy luminosity , from @xmath215 in dwarf irregulars to @xmath216 in the brightest disk - dominated spirals .",
    "this trend is consistent , although perhaps a bit too pronounced , with the systematic blueing of disks in the hubble sequence towards fainter , more irregular galaxies .",

    "halos of faint galaxies have circular velocities that can exceed by up to @xmath217 the rotation speed of the disks , and the opposite seems to hold in the brightest spirals .",
    "disks with rotation speeds in the range ( @xmath218 , @xmath212 ) appear to be surrounded by halos of @xmath143 .",
    "this explains naturally the weak dependence between halo mass and luminosity found in dynamical studies of binary galaxies and satellite - primary pairs .",
    "it also implies the existence of a critical halo mass above which disk galaxies would be too massive to survive as such .",
    "\\6 ) the above conclusions pose important constraints on the distribution of disk sizes and rotation speeds .",
    "together with general considerations regarding global disk stability , they impose firm upper limits on the angular momentum , size , and rotation speed of disks .",
    "in particular , they predict that very few galaxies with @xmath219 kpc , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 @xmath175 kpc should exist , in good agreement with observations .",
    "our results have important applications in semianalytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "they confirm independently the strong dependence on halo circular velocity of the mass fraction attached to luminous galaxies that had been hypothesized in order to reconcile the the dark halo mass function with the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "our modeling also suggests that semianalytic models that assume a direct proportionality between @xmath2 and @xmath3 may have substantially overestimated the number of @xmath222 galaxies .",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 suggested by our modeling ( figure 10 and eq.15 ) implies that fewer luminous galaxies are expected , thus offering a promising explanation for the failure of semianalytic models to match simultaneously the luminosity density of the universe and the zero point of the tully - fisher relation ( kauffmann et al .",

    "our analysis has made use of this surprisingly tight relation between disk luminosity and rotation speed , but provides no firm clues to elucidate its origin . actually , by pointing to a non - linear relation between halo circular velocity and disk rotation speed it questions the most promising scenario : that the tully - fisher relation just reflects the equivalence of mass and circular velocity ( @xmath223 ) in systems formed within a cosmological context . until a clear understanding of this and other strikingly tight correlations between the dynamical , morphological , and luminous properties of disk galaxies emerges",
