    "secondly , we use the stellar masses derived from fits to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the galaxy nucleus and the whole galaxy as given in @xcite .",
    "these are overlaid on the right panel of figure [ fig : f1 ] ( _ crosses _ ) and give an excellent match to the cumulative mass distribution derived from the srsic fit to the light profile .",

    "figure [ fig : f3 ] shows the time taken for two nuclei that have masses @xmath95m@xmath38 and initial separation of 44pc to sink via dynamical friction in halos b , d , e and f , assuming that equation ( [ eq : l1 ] ) fully describes the friction process .",
    "we chose this initial separation of 44pc since this is the most likely deprojected distance of the two nuclei ( their observed separation on the sky is 32pc ) .",
    "in all haloes with cusp slopes steeper than 0.75 , the nuclei coalesce rapidly .",
    "this suggests that , were equation ( [ eq : l1 ] ) the whole story , it would be very unlikely to observe such a close double nucleus in any dwarf galaxy in virgo .",
    "however , as we have demonstrated in the previous section , the merging nuclei will create a small core and stall indefinitely , leading to a much higher probability of observing double nuclei .",
    "therefore we ran an additional series of simulations with two perturbers on either coplanar or perpendicular orbits .",
    "again we used the haloes presented in table [ tab : haloes ] .",
    "the stalling behaviour is shown in figure [ fig : f5 ] . in haloes b ,",
    "d and e , the nuclei do not stall . only in halo f",
    "do they stall above 32pc .",
    "these results suggest for slopes of 1.0 or steeper , this stalling mechanism does not crucially change the results we derived analytically in this section .",
    "however for slopes shallower than 1.0 it affects these results quite dramatically .",
    "it is interesting that the most recent cdm halo simulations have cusps shallower than @xmath96 on these scales @xcite .        to summarise our findings : assuming that vcc  128 has a core - stalled binary nucleus , we can exclude all steep inner log density slopes of 0.75 or higher .",
    "our current best explanation for vcc  128 s observed binary nucleus is that the two nuclei transformed an initially steeper density profile with an inner log density slope between 0.75 and 0.5 into a core during its initial sinking period .",
    "the nuclei then stalled at the edge of this freshly created core .",
    "note that a very shallow inner log density slope like 0.5 is also disfavoured .",
    "this is because in this case , the nuclei stall at @xmath97pc ( see figure [ fig : f5 ] ) creating some tension with the observed projected separation .",
    "therefore we conclude that an underlying dark matter halo with @xmath98 at @xmath99% of the virial radius provides the best explanation for the observations .",
    "one should note here that this cusp - core transformation mechanism does not explain the dynamical friction timescale problem of fornax within a @xmath3cdm ( @xmath100 1.0 ) halo ( see figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because in that case the globular clusters in fornax are too light and too distant from the centre of their host galaxy for this cusp - core transformation mechanism to play a significant role .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hash ] ) predicts for fornax ( assuming @xmath22 ) a core of only 44pc .",
    "this is far smaller then the projected radius of the innermost globular cluster in fornax , which is at 240pc .",
    "we have performed a detailed investigation into the disruption of central cusps via the transfer of energy from sinking massive objects .",
    "constant density inner regions form at the radius where the enclosed mass approximately matches the mass of the infalling body .",

    "core formation due to sinking massive objects can soften a central dark matter cusp reducing the expected wimp annihilation flux ( predicted by structure formation simulations that model dark matter in the absence of baryons ) by up to a third .",
    "core formation due to sinking massive objects could help to alleviate the long - standing cusp - core problem ( see eg : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from equation ( [ eq : hash ] ) , a @xmath1011kpc sized core will form from perturber having @xmath1011% of the mass of the host .",
    "this recovers the earlier results of @xcite and @xcite",
    ". however , such massive infalling perturbers must later disrupt or be removed in order to be consistent with the low surface density of stars and gas observed in galaxies where the cusp - core problem is most apparent .",
    "3 .   infalling nuclei at the centres of galaxies will evacuate a core and stall indefinitely , provided that the initial background density is not significantly steeper than @xmath0 .",
    "this could explain a number of binary nuclei systems in the universe .",
    "we focused on the special binary nucleus system vcc  128 since it is dark matter dominated at all radii .",
    "assuming that its binary nucleus can be explained by our ` stalled binary ' model , we found that the initial inner log density slope @xmath8 of the dark matter halo of vcc  128 must be @xmath102 at @xmath103 of the virial radius .",
    "for @xmath104 initially , the dynamical friction sink - in time is so small in comparison to the lifetime of the galaxy that we run into a fine tuning problem . for @xmath105 initially , the nuclei stall far beyond their current projected separation of 32pc . for @xmath106 initially , the nuclei create a central constant density core of separation @xmath107pc after which they stall indefinitely .",
    "our preferred inner slopes are consistent with those found in the recent billion particle cdm halo simulations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
