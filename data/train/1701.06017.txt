    "the spin - hall effect ( she ) is one of the most important effect in the new field of spin - orbitronics",
    ". however , in spite of a large number of excellent reports about she ( see @xcite and references therein ) , a fundamental ambiguity seems to persist in the definition of the stationary regime , leading to different predictions as to the presence of pure spin - current on the stationary state @xcite .",
    "the she describes the spin - accumulation generated at the edges of a paramagnet with strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , while injecting an electric current @xcite . the phenomenological description of the she is based on the dyakonov - perel transport equations @xcite , which are a generalization of ohm s law for the spin - dependent electric carriers in the presence of soc . as shown in fig.1",
    ", the two spin - channel model can be used in order to describe the she : it suffices to assume that the spin - orbit scattering plays the same role as an effective magnetic field @xmath0 in a two - channel version of the hall effect .",
    "the main property of this effective magnetic field is expressed by the reciprocity relation @xmath1 : the effective magnetic field is acting as an external static magnetic field applied along the direction of the effective field @xmath2 for the electric carriers belonging to the @xmath3 channel , while it is acting in the opposite direction for the electric carriers belonging to the @xmath4 channel ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "consequently , the system can be viewed as a simple superimposition of two standard hall devices with two populations of electric charges experiencing opposite magnetic fields .",
    "more precisely , the magnetic field along the @xmath2 direction generates a charge accumulation @xmath5 at the edge , while the magnetic field along the @xmath6 direction generates a charge accumulation @xmath7 at the same edge .",
    "the superimposition of the two sub - systems leads to a vanishing electric charge accumulation @xmath8 and non - zero spin - accumulation @xmath9 .",
    "[ h ! ]    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the usual theoretical approach to the she consists in calculating the stationary state after summing over the total system , i.e. for zero charge accumulation @xcite .",
    "the result is a generation of a transverse pure spin current @xmath10 .",
    "this generation of a pure spin current is not satisfying from the thermodynamical point of view .",
    "indeed , the second law of thermodynamics imposes that the stationary state should correspond to the minimum power dissipation . as shown in a recent report based on this variational principle @xcite , the minimum power dissipation in the spin - hall system",
    "is reached for @xmath11 in the bulk , except for corbino configurations @xcite .",
    "the corresponding system is then less constrained than the previous one .",
    "the aim of this work is to study these two results in the framework of the usual definition @xmath12 of the stationary state , and to understand the apparent contradiction on the basis of the screening equations .",
    "it is shown that the last result ( @xmath11 ) is obtained if the condition of stationary state is applied before summing over the two channels ( with charge accumulation @xmath13 ) @xcite , while the former result ( @xmath10 ) is obtained if the stationarity condition is apply after summing over the two channels ( charge accumulation @xmath14 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follow .",
    "the first section treats the standard hall effect in the formalism of mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the screening equation is derived and the usual approximations related to constant conductivity and small debye - fermi length are analyzed .",
    "the second section is devoted to the two spin - channel model for the she without spin - flip scattering , with the derivation of the screening equations .",
    "the third section presents the derivation of the screening equation that includes spin - flip scattering .",
    "the section four analyzes the corresponding transport equations in terms of the dyakonov - perel equations .",
    "the goal of this section is to characterize the stationary state of the standard hall device on the basis of the law @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the density of electric carriers ) , and investigating the approximations that consists in assuming constant conductivity and small screening length .",
    "ohm s law reads : @xmath17 where @xmath16 is the density of electric carriers of charge @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the chemical potential , and the mobility tensor @xmath20 is related to the conductivity tensor @xmath21 by the relation @xmath22 .",
    "if the sample under consideration is an isotropic planar layer , to which a magnetic field @xmath23 is applied along the direction @xmath24 perpendicular to the layer , the mobility tensor in the orthonormal basis @xmath25 is expressed by the matrix : @xmath26 where the coefficient @xmath27 is the hall mobility ( which is an odd function of @xmath28 ) . according to the drude relation we have @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the relaxation time and @xmath31 is the effective mass ) so that @xmath32 does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "introducing a unit vector @xmath33 in the direction of the applied field @xmath23 , the vector form of eq.([ohmn ] ) reads : @xmath34 on the other hand , the chemical potential is defined by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is either the fermi temperature ( @xmath37 ) in the case of a metal or the temperature of the thermostat in the case of a non - degenerated semi - conductor , @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath39 is the constant density of the electric carriers that corresponds to the electric neutrality of the material , and @xmath40 describes the chemical potential related to relaxation processes , which is also constant in the bulk material .",
    "the electric potential @xmath41 is produced by the electric generator and imposes the constant electric field @xmath42 along the @xmath43 axis . on the other hand",
    ", the electric potential @xmath44 takes into account the effect of the magnetic field @xmath23 . due to the lorentz force",
    ", the consequence of the application of the magnetic field is a redistribution of the electric carriers in the direction @xmath45 , which results in a charge accumulation @xmath46 at the edges .",
    "the charge accumulation generates , in turn , an electric field @xmath47 defined by gauss s law : @xmath48 for convenience , the two contributions @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the gradient of the chemical potential can be combined in a single electric field @xmath51 . inserting the expression of the chemical potential eq.([chempot ] ) into omh s law eq.([ohmn2 ] ) we obtain : @xmath52 where the diffusion constants are defined as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the divergence of eq.([ohmn3 ] ) reads : @xmath55 where we have used the vector relations @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the consequence of the last relation is that the hall term in the right hand side of eq.([ohmn3 ] ) disappears from the definition of the stationary states .",
    "nevertheless , the hall effect is still present as it is responsible for the charge accumulation @xmath58 , i.e. as it is responsible for the derivative of the electric field @xmath59 .",
    "the stationarity condition writes @xmath60 . in the case of a recombination between electrons and holes , or for other relaxation mechanisms",
    ", we should add the relaxation parameter @xmath61 such that @xmath62 ( an explicit expression of @xmath61 can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the expression the stationarity condition leads to the following * screening equation * for the electric charge accumulation @xmath58 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the screening length .",
    "this is an exact result for the hall bar assuming translation invariance along @xmath43 . in the case",
    "@xmath65 , the screening length is the debye length @xmath66 .      when @xmath67 , the conductivity @xmath68 is constant .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath69 , then eq.([screening ] ) reduces to the well - known screening equation at equilibrium : @xmath70 the electrostatic charge accumulation decays exponentially to zero with a typical length @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , the last term @xmath72 in the left hand side of eq.([divohmn ] ) accounts for the variation of the conductivity @xmath73 due to the electrostatic charge accumulation over a distance @xmath74 from the border of the hall device .",
    "the approximation @xmath67 as been well established as correct for conventional systems .",
    "if we assume @xmath74 small , we have in second order : @xmath75 a moderate non - conservation of the electric charges @xmath76 has no consequence in the framework of this approximation . the approximation of small debye - fermi length * b * together with that of constant conductivity * a * ( the right - hand side of eq.([screening2 ] ) is vanishing ) results in the * bulk approximation * @xmath77 .",
    "the goal of this section is to introduce the two spin channels labeled by the index @xmath78 , and to characterize the stationary states defined by the conservation laws @xmath79 ( in the absence of spin - flip scattering ) .",
    "the spin - dependent conductivity @xmath80 of the spin - channels can be introduced through the drude formula : @xmath81 where the relaxation @xmath30 is not spin - dependent , and @xmath31 is the effective mass .",
    "hence , the mobility @xmath82 does not depend on @xmath83 and is spin independent .",
    "consequently , the diffusion constant is also spin - independent @xmath84 .",
    "in contrast , the spin - orbit diffusion is spin - dependent @xmath85 ( where the sign ( @xmath86 ) corresponds to the spin @xmath3 and the sign ( @xmath87 ) corresponds to the spin @xmath4 ) , with the relation @xmath88 .",
    "ohm s law reads : @xmath89 where the mobility tensor is given by : @xmath90 in a vector form we have : @xmath91 where the sign ( @xmath86 ) corresponds to the spin @xmath3 and the sign ( @xmath87 ) corresponds to the spin @xmath4 . as shown in the last section , eq.([ohms2 ] ) is a generalization of the dyakonov - perel equations .",
    "according to the model depicted in fig.1 , the chemical potential of the charge carriers in each spin channel is given by eq.([chempot ] ) : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the contribution of the electric generator which imposes a constant electric field along the @xmath43 direction : @xmath94 .",
    "the contribution @xmath95 takes into account the effect of soc through the effective magnetic field @xmath96 , and @xmath97 accounts for the spin - dependent properties of the electric carriers .",
    "as described in fig.1 and in the introduction , the effect of the effective magnetic field @xmath98 is equivalent to that of the usual hall effect for each spin - channel .",
    "it leads to a redistribution of the electric charges @xmath99 such that @xmath100 .",
    "this distribution defines a spin - dependent electric field @xmath101 along the @xmath45-direction through gauss s law @xmath102 .",
    "the two contributions @xmath41 and @xmath95 in eq.([chempots ] ) can be combined into a single electric field @xmath103 . inserting the expression of the chemical potential eq.([chempots ] ) into the omh s law eq.([ohms2 ] ) yields : @xmath104    it is important to note here that the choice of @xmath105 instead of @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 instead of @xmath108 ) in the expression of the chemical potential eq.([chempots ] ) corresponds to the model depicted in fig.1 where each spin channel is treated separately . if the two sub - systems of fig.1 , are combined before applying the stationarity condition , the symmetry property @xmath109 related to the two sub - systems reduces to a property of the total system @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding system is then analogous to the corbino configuration @xcite in which charge accumulation is forbidden ( due to the absence of edge ) , and this configuration imposes a hall current for both subsystems in the stationary state : we have @xmath110 , instead of @xmath11 . in agreement with the dyakonov - perel equations , most publications about the she @xcite assumed implicitly the more constrained situation @xmath111 and the generation of a pure spin - current .",
    "the case of the less constrained system @xmath109 is developed below , keeping in minde that the other situation is recovered with replacing @xmath108 instead of @xmath107 .    from eq.([ohms2 ] ) , we derived the expression of the stationarity condition @xmath112 : @xmath113 equation ( [ divohms2 ] ) can be put into the form : @xmath114 where the screening length @xmath115 is approximatively equal to the debye length @xmath116 .    using @xmath117 , equation ( [ divohms3 ] ) reduces to :    @xmath118    for each spin channel , eq.([screenings ] ) is equivalent to that of the simple hall effect eq.([screening ] ) because the two spin - dependent equations are decoupled .",
    "this is also equivalent to a simple screening equation of a transport process without hall effect , in which the charge accumulation @xmath99 is imposed at the interfaces by other means .    in the approximation in which we assumed * constant conductivity * ( @xmath119 ) and @xmath69",
    "we obtain : @xmath120 the effect of the electrostatic charge accumulation decreases exponentially over the screening length @xmath74 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the charge accumulation at the edges produced by the effective field @xmath0 .",
    "the spin accumulation takes place @xmath123 with zero total charge accumulation @xmath14 @xcite .    on the other hand , in the approximation of small debye length but without assuming constant conductivity ,",
    "entails the relation : @xmath124 the approximation of small debye - fermi length * b * together with that of constant conductivity * a * ( the right - hand side of eq.([screening2 ] ) is vanishing ) results in the * bulk approximation * @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "this result is also valid in the case of spin - independent field @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 in eq.([chempots ] ) ) .",
    "it is easy to take into account phenomenologically the spin - flip relaxation in the framework of the two channel model . as a consequence , a well - known interface effect due to non - local giant magnetoresistance",
    "@xcite will be superimposed to the spin - hall effect described above .",
    "indeed , if the surface is replaced by an interface with a ferromagnetic material @xcite the boundary conditions related to the spin system can not be left free , and the situation described in the previous section should be revisited . in particular , it is necessary to take into account the gradient @xmath129 of the spin - dependent chemical potentials @xmath97 near the interface .",
    "we must then consider four forces in the gradient of the chemical potential @xmath130 .",
    "the pumping force @xmath131 where @xmath132 is responsible for the out - of - equilibrium state of the two spin populations @xcite .",
    "this force also leads to the well - known giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect @xcite .    in the framework of the two channel model ,",
    "the condition for the spin conservation becomes : @xmath133 where the spin - flip onsager coefficient @xmath134 is related to the spin diffusion length ( see below ) measured in gmr experiments @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath134 is inversely proportional the spin - relaxation time @xmath135 .",
    "equation ( [ divohms3 ] ) becomes : @xmath136 we will not try to solve this system of two coupled equations , but the analysis performed in the previous sections remains applicable .",
    "let us focus on the * bulk approximation * @xmath125 , which is also valid in the region @xmath137 , in which @xmath138 is not zero .",
    "assuming also , for the sake of simplicity tha @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ screeningsf2 ] ) then reduces to : @xmath139    we recognize the spin - accumulation equation for @xmath138 which is formally equivalent to that of the spin - accumulation described in the context of gmr : @xmath140 where @xmath141 with @xmath142 . independently , we can look at the approximation of small @xmath74 , without assuming constant conductivity . multiplying eq.([screeningsf2 ] ) by @xmath143 yields :    @xmath144    in a metal , the debye length @xmath74 is of the order of a nanometer while the spin - flip relaxation length @xmath145 is few tens of nanometers .",
    "to second order in @xmath74 , eq.([screeningsf6 ] ) reduces to :    @xmath146    equation eq.([screeningsf7 ] ) which describes the she with spin - flip scattering is the same as eq.([screenings4 ] ) which describe she without spin - flip scattering .    to conclude this section",
    ", we can state that despite the existence of the gmr - like spin - accumulation at the interface over a distance @xmath145 , there is no qualitative change introduced by the spin - flip relaxation in the bulk she , as long as the spin - diffusion length is much larger than the debye length @xmath147 .",
    "in particular , the stationary state defined by @xmath148 is maintained in the bulk together with the spin - accumulation at the edges due to soc .",
    "this soc spin - accumulation is superimposed on the spin - accumulation related to the spin - flip and giant magnetoresistance described by eq.([gmr ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as in the previous section , this state is also compatible with the stationary state defined by the pure spin - current @xmath10 if the condition @xmath111 is imposed before applying the stationarity condition ( case described in @xcite ) .",
    "in other terms , introducing spin - flip scattering in the model does not help in figuring out what definition of the stationary state is the more relevant .",
    "in this section , the transport equations eq.([ohms2 ] ) in the presence of the chemical potential eq.([chempots ] ) are analyzed .",
    "we show in subsection * a * that the transport equation is equivalent to the dyakonov - perel equations in the case of the electric field @xmath149 is spin - independent . in subsection * b * , the transport equation eq.([ohms2 ] ) are analyzed in terms of a generalized dyakonov - perel equation .      introducing the chemical potential @xmath150 in eq.([ohms2 ] ) , we obtain for @xmath151 : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the spin - orbit diffusion constant .    defining the asymmetry of charge carriers density between the two spin channels @xmath154 and @xmath155",
    ", we can define the charge current @xmath156 and the spin current @xmath157 by summing and subtracting the two eqs.([ohm_mobil2 ] ) : @xmath158 where the unit vector @xmath33 defines the orientation of the spin - polarization .",
    "we can check that eq.([ohm_so ] ) is equivalent to the dyakonov - perel equations ( in the dyakonov - perel form @xcite ) , when we introduce the spin - polarisation @xmath159 : @xmath160 the second tensorial equation in eqs.([dp_true ] ) can equivalently be put into the vector form : @xmath161 where @xmath162 corresponds to the projection along the @xmath33 direction ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "since we have @xmath164 , the dyakonov model defined by eqs.([dp_true ] ) is equivalent to the two channel model providing the phenomenological constants of the model are defined as follows : the mobility of charge carriers is @xmath165 , the spin - orbit mobility is @xmath166,the diffusion constant is @xmath167 , the spin - orbit diffusion constant is @xmath168 , and the spin - polarization is @xmath169 .    the main consequence of eq.([ohm_so ] )",
    "can be calculated in the following simple configuration in the bulk . since the spin - hall effect is characterized by zero charge accumulation @xmath14 , the electric field along the axis @xmath45 also vanishes , @xmath170 , in the absence of other contributions . for the bulk approximation",
    "the diffusion terms and the spin accumulation @xmath171 vanish , and the dp equations reduces to @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( and @xmath174 ) . *",
    "these equations necessarily lead to a non - vanishing pure spin - current * @xmath10 . here , the spin - hall angle is defined by the ratio of the spin currents @xmath175 to the injected current @xmath176 : @xmath177 .",
    "the form eq.([ohm_so ] ) of the dp equations is probably the main motivation for the usual description of the she .",
    "we discuss now the case developed in this work , in which the electric field @xmath101 is due to gauss s law @xmath178 and is spin - dependent . introducing the chemical potential eq.([chempots ] ) into the transport equations eq.([ohms2 ] ) leads to the following generalized dp equations : @xmath179 or : @xmath180 the particular case where @xmath127 leads to the dp equations obtained in the previous subsection @xmath181 .",
    "let us look at the simple situation calculated in the previous subsection .",
    "since the spin - hall effect is characterized by the symmetry @xmath100 ( when @xmath182 is spin - independent ) , the relation @xmath183 is verified when other contributions are absent .",
    "we then have @xmath184 and @xmath185 . for the bulk approximation",
    "the diffusion terms and the spin - accumulation @xmath171 vanish , such that the generalized dp equations eqs.([dp_gene ] ) are reduced to @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the stationarity condition @xmath189 * generates the spin - dependent electric fields * : @xmath190 . from the experimental point of view , the two results are very similar in both cases * a * and * b * , except that a * pure spin - voltage * @xmath191 is measured instead of a pure spin - current @xmath192 , and the * spin - hall angle * @xmath193 is now measured as the ratio of the electric fields instead of the ratio of the electric currents .",
    "we have analyses the spin - hall effect in the framework of the two spin - channel model ( labeled by the indices @xmath78 ) depicted in fig.1 . in this context , the spin - hall effect and the corresponding spin - accumulation at the edges is a consequence of the electrostatic charge accumulation that is generated in each spin - channel @xmath99 by the spin - orbit effective magnetic field @xmath0 over the screening distance @xmath74 . the main property of the spin - orbit coupling is expressed by the reciprocity relation @xmath98 which leads to inverse charge accumulation @xmath100 at the same edge .",
    "it is shown that two possible types of stationary states can be applied to this she model .",
    "on one hand , the stationary condition can be applied before summing over the two spin channels , such that the stationary state is defined by zero electric charge accumulation , non - zero spin - accumulation at the edges , and zero transverse current @xmath148 inside the bulk . on the other hand",
    ", the stationary condition can be applied after summing over the two spin channels , so that the stationary state is defined by zero electric charge accumulation , non - zero spin - accumulation , and non - zero pure spin - current @xmath194 inside the bulk .",
    "the first situation corresponds to a generation of an electric field in each channel @xmath101 such that @xmath195 and a total electric field @xmath196 such that @xmath197 .",
    "it is shown that the transport equations that corresponds to the last situation ( with the generation of pure spin - current in the bulk ) are the dyakonov - perel equations , in which the electric field @xmath108 is spin - independent .",
    "the former situation ( without zero transverse current in the bulk ) corresponds to a generalized dyakonov - perel equation , in which the electric field is spin - dependent .",
    "finally , it is clear that the stationary state with the pure spin - current dissipates more than that with zero transverse current . from that point of view , the corresponding system is more constrained than that without pure spin - current .    from the experimental point of view , the presence or absence of the charge accumulation @xmath99 or spin - dependent voltage @xmath105 in each spin - channel is probably impossible to measure ( only the spin - accumulation and total voltage is accessible ) .",
    "however , discriminating the stationary states with or without transverse currents @xmath192 in the bulk should in principle be easy .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the resistances measured with or without the pure spin - current is given by the square of the spin - hall angle @xmath198 , as discussed in reference @xcite .",
