    "however , by modifying a version of the method of steepest descent due to van der waerden @xcite , we are able to produce a uniform asymptotic expansion of @xmath16 in decreasing powers of @xmath20 as @xmath21 , and this leads us to an expansion for @xmath22 in decreasing powers of @xmath23 as this quantity approaches infinity .",
