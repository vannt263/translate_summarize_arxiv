    "the inflationary scenario @xcite has become the current paradigm to describe the early evolution of the universe .",
    "the success of this theory comes from a number of predictions which have been confirmed by the observations , the main one being the causal mechanism for the generation of the primordial cosmological perturbation which inflation provides @xcite .",
    "inflation is generally modelled by general relativity ( gr ) coupled to scalar field matter . the scalar field ( called _ inflaton _ ) is responsible for the accelerated expansion of space .",
    "the success of inflation as a theory for the origin of structure comes from the fact that the wavelengths of fixed comoving modes which are of cosmological interest today , namely wavelengths corresponding to the present large - scale structure and to the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , were sub - hubble at the beginning of the period of inflation .",
    "they cross the hubble horizon about 50 - 60 hubble times , or _",
    "e - folds _ , before the end of inflation . thus , inflation must last at least that long to solve the problems of the standard cosmological model ( scm ) @xcite .",
    "most inflationary models have a period of accelerated expansion which lasts much more than the 50 - 60 _ e - folds _ required solve the scm problems .",
    "if the period of inflation last for more than about 70 _ e - folds _ ( this number depends very slightly on the energy scale at which inflation takes place - to get the above number we are assuming that it is the grand unification scale ) , then all of the wavelengths important today were smaller that the planck length at the beginning of inflation . in this regime",
    "we can not trust the calculations since general relativity will no longer yield a good description of the physics .",
    "this is the known trans - planckian problem for cosmological fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a correct computation of both the generation and evolution of fluctuations in the trans - planckian regime must be done in the correct uv completion of the theory .",
    "this problem is named after the analogous trans - planckian problem for hawking radiation in black - hole physics @xcite . in the cosmological context",
    "this problem was discussed in the literature in many different toy model modifications of general relativity coupled to a canonical scalar field .",
    "these models describe the evolution on sub - planckian wavelengths by imposing _",
    "ad - hoc _ modifications of the usual physics , _",
    "e.g. _ modified dispersion relations @xcite or non - commutativity @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to construct toy models in which the standard predictions of inflation are changed , in others they are maintained @xcite either fully or up to small corrections .",
    "for example , imposing the usual initial conditions on a time - like `` new physics hypersurface '' @xcite given by the physical wavelength being some fixed uv cutoff scale smaller or equal to the planck scale yields a scale - invariant power spectrum of curvature fluctuations with small amplitude superimposed oscillations if , on the other hand , we assume that a short period of inflation is preceded by a short non - singular bounce and ( before that ) the time reverse of the background evolution , then a deep red spectrum with index @xmath0 results @xcite .",
    "however , to go beyond toy model studies , we must be able to perform the analysis of cosmological fluctuations in a full quantum gravity theory .",
    "hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity @xcite is a candidate theory of quantum gravity which provides a well motivated framework for describing the evolution of the universe on trans - planckian scales .",
    "it is an theory of gravity in @xmath1 dimensions which uses the same metric degrees of freedom as general relativity but which is power - counting renormalizable ( with respect to the scaling symmetry to be introduced below ) .",
    "this is achieved by picking a preferred time direction , thus abandoning the full space - time diffeomorphism invariance ( reducing the symmetry to simply spatial diffeomorphisms ) , and by introducing an anisotropic scaling of lifshitz type .",
    "the loss of space - time isotropy has as consequence the absence of lorentz symmetry , a symmetry which appears as an emergent symmetry in the infrared ( ir ) , where gr is recovered .    as a consequence of the loss of the space - dependent time reparametrization symmetry of general relativity ,",
    "one of the four gauge symmetries for cosmological perturbations ( namely the space dependent time rescaling symmetry ) is lost , and since the theory presents the same number of basic degrees of freedom as general relativity , there is an extra scalar perturbation mode ( scalar in terms of its transformation under spatial rotations ) @xcite .",
    "since it was proposed by horava in its most simple version @xcite , many other versions of the theory were proposed in the literature .",
    "we have mainly two versions : the `` projectable '' , where the lapse function depends only on time to mimic the reduced symmetry of the problem ; or the `` non - projectable '' version , where the lapse function depends on space and time as in gr . in the `` projectable '' version the extra degree of freedom of the theory is dynamical @xcite and _ ghost - like _ or tachyonic .",
    "this version is also plagued by `` strong coupling '' problems @xcite , which may spoil the validity of this setup .    in the original form of the `` non - projectable '' version , the extra degree of freedom",
    "is non - dynamical @xcite at linear order about a spatially homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "`` strong coupling '' problems may arise @xcite .",
    "the most studied type of a `` non - projectable '' theory ( one which contains all of the terms which are allowed by power - counting renormalizability and symmetry ) is the `` healthy extension '' @xcite that appears to fix these `` strong couplings '' problems and pathologies associated with the extra degree of freedom that appear in the other versions of the theory .",
    "fluctuations in the healthy extension of hl gravity were first considered in @xcite . as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the extra degree of freedom now becomes dynamical . with appropriate choices of the parameters in the hl lagrangian ,",
    "the extra degree of freedom is neither ghost - like nor tachyonic .",
    "it is important only in the uv and decouples in the ir .",
    "this is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since we know , from observations , that we can only have one propagating scalar metric degree of freedom in the ir . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that in the uv there are two propagating degrees of freedom makes the theory a promising one to study in the context of the trans - planckian problem for fluctuations .",
    "gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in this context have been analyzed in @xcite . ]    in the presence of spatial curvature , hl gravity can lead to bouncing cosmological solutions @xcite . here , however , we will assume the existence of scalar field matter which leads to an inflationary phase during the evolution of the early universe .",
    "we will use the `` healthy extension '' of the hl gravity to study the trans - planckian problem for fluctuations .",
    "we are interested in checking , based on a well motivated description of the uv and ir theory , if the predictions of inflation for cosmological perturbations are altered .",
    "we will have to take into account two effects : the change in the physics in the uv region that will be manifest in a modified dispersion relation of corley - jacobson type @xcite ( as the ones which were studied in @xcite ) ; and the presence of an extra degree of freedom that will be dynamical in the uv ( for wavelengths smaller that hubble radius in our case ) .",
    "this extra degree of freedom can be interpreted as an `` entropy '' perturbation , in analogy with what occurs in multi - field inflation models@xcite , but in this case the extra field is a scalar perturbation of the metric . the entropy mode is coupled to the `` adiabatic perturbation '' and will influence its dynamics while the wavelength is sub - hubble .",
    "thus , we need to analyse the coupled system of differential equations for both scalar perturbations modes in the different regimes of the theory in order to evaluate the final power spectrum of the `` adiabatic '' mode .    the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : setup ] , we give a brief description of the `` healthy extension '' of hl , setting up the theory we are using and calculating linear perturbations about a homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "we show how the reduced symmetry group gauges only one of the degrees of freedom , leaving one extra degree of freedom , by calculating the second order action . in section [ sec : cosm_pert ] we study the cosmological perturbations .",
    "first we find the canonical variables of the problem and show that one of these corresponds to the usual mukhanov - sasaki variable and the other decouples in the ir .",
    "we take the uv limit of the theory to find the contributions of the trans - planckian physics .",
    "the initial state is calculated by minimizing the vacuum energy and the solutions to the inhomogeneous equations of motion are found in each region of the problem .",
    "finally , the power spectrum is calculated .",
    "we find that the overall scale - invariance of the spectrum is maintained , but that there are superimposed oscillations with an effective frequency depending on the wavenumber ( very different from the oscillations which are seen in the approach of @xcite to the trans - planckian problem ) .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is not suppressed ( again in contrast to what is seen in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the frequency of oscillation is very large making the effect extremely difficult to measure .",
    "in hl theory it is natural to use the adm ( arnowitt , desner and misner ) formalism that separates space - time into time and spatial foliations : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the metric of the spatial section , _",
    "n _ is the lapse function and @xmath4 is the shift vector .",
    "as mentioned , the lapse function can be restricted to depend only on time , yielding the `` projectable '' theory , or else it is taken to depend on both space and time , yielding the `` non - projectable '' version .",
    "the `` healthy extension '' is a non - projectable version of the theory with all of the terms allowed by the residual symmetries and by power - counting renormalizability included .",
    "thus @xmath5 and we describe the same lapse function as in gr . in this case , we must include in the action terms proportional to the quantity : @xmath6 because of the anisotropic scaling , the classical scaling dimensions of the coordinates of the theory ( when the scaling dimension is @xmath7 as it is in four space - time - dimensional hl gravity ) are , in units of spatial momenta : @xmath8_{s } = -3 $ ] , @xmath9_{s } = -1 $ ] .",
    "with this we have that @xmath10 = 2 $ ] .",
    "the adm fields have scaling dimension : @xmath11_{s}=[n]_{s}=0 $ ] and @xmath12$]=2 .",
    "the action of hl gravity is constructed by including all terms with scaling dimension smaller or equal to six , in order to obtain a theory which is power - counting renormalizable , and which are invariant under the spatial diffeomorphisms , i.e. under elements of the symmetry group @xmath13 .",
    "the `` healthy extension '' action can be written as , following @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the kinetic term is the one that contains time derivatives of the metric in a covariant way with respect to the new foliating preserving symmetry , @xmath13 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the extrinsic curvature of the constant time hypersurfaces .",
    "the potential term is constructed by including all terms that preserve @xmath13 until the sixth spatial derivative : @xmath18\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the cosmological constant and has dimension of momentum squared and the coefficients are dimensionless .",
    "the new components proportional to @xmath20 that appear in the `` healthy extension '' are : @xmath21\\,,\\label{he}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients are dimensionless . as we are interested in obtaining an inflationary background cosmology",
    ", we include matter in the form of a scalar field , with matter lagrangian @xcite @xmath22 where the potential terms are given by : @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the scalar field has scaling dimension @xmath27_{s}=(d - z)/2=0 $ ] .",
    "in the way it is written above , the coefficients are not dimensionless as the previous coefficients are .",
    "if we want to write them as dimensionless coefficients we have to make the following substitution : the order 2 coefficient @xmath28 is already dimensionless ; the order four coefficients are changed to @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 dimensionless ; and the dimension six coefficients are changed to @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 dimensionless .",
    "the non - projectable version of hl can contain more than 60 terms .",
    "here we only considered the ones that are important for the scalar part of the perturbations , the perturbations we interested in . in the ir",
    "the gr action is recovered when @xmath39 .",
    "we can now obtain the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "varying the action with respect to @xmath40 , we have the momentum constraint : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that ( [ eq : vinc_momentum ] ) is a local constraint .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint can be obtained by varying the action with respect to the lapse function , @xmath44 : @xmath45 with @xmath46 and the new terms from `` healthy extension '' : @xmath47 this constraint is a local constraint , unlike what happens in the `` projectable '' version of the theory",
    ".    one might think that the presence of two local constraints should lead to a reduction of the number of degrees of freedom of the theory to have the same number as in general relativity . however , this is not the case .",
    "the local hamiltonian constraint is not able to decouple the extra degree of freedom in all the regimes of the theory , only in the ir .",
    "we can see this by studying cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "perturbing about an isotropic and homogeneous universe described by the spatially flat frw metric , @xmath48 the background values and scalar perturbation of the adm variables are given by @xcite : @xmath49\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we must also consider the perturbation in the scalar field , given by : @xmath50    the invariance under @xmath13 , allow us to set @xmath51 . because of the reduced symmetry we can no longer constrain another degree of freedom of the perturbations and use the standard gauges used in gr @xcite .",
    "thus we are left with more degrees of freedom than we would have in gr : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "there are two reasons which could lead to large deviations from the usual predictions of standard inflationary cosmology : firstly , the dispersion relation on trans - planckian scales is non - standard , and secondly there is a second scalar metric fluctuation mode which acts as a source term in the evolution of the curvature fluctuations .",
    "the time interval during which mode mixing occurs depends on the wavenumber @xmath92 of the fluctuation mode .",
    "the result of our analysis is that the overall scale - invariance of cosmological perturbations is maintained in hl inflation . on the other hand ,",
    "there are oscillations in the amplitude of the spectrum as a function of @xmath92 whose relative amplitude is of order one , and whose frequency shows a characteristic scaling proportional to @xmath222 , the power being determined by the power of the highest power of the spatial derivative term in the hl action .",
    "the frequency of oscillation is so high , however , that it is unlikely that an experiment with finite frequency resolution will be able to detect these oscillations .",

    "the oscillations in the spectrum come from the particular solution of the mode evolution equation ( induced by mode mixing ) .",
