    "the classification of quantum deformations of lorentz symmetries described by classical r - matrices was given firstly by zakrzewski @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and has been further extended to the classification of classical r - matrices for poincar algebra in @xcite .",
    "the classification of dual hopf - algebraic quantum deformations of poincar group were presented in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the infinitesimal r - matrix description of the deformations of poincar algebra presented in @xcite has been extended in several papers to finite hopf - algebraic deformations , with conclusive results obtained in @xcite .",
    "because majority of studied deformations were triangular , i.e. described by the twist deformations , they permitted ( see e.g. @xcite ) to derive explicit formulas for the non - commutative algebra of deformed space - time coordinates by the use of so - called star product realizations .",
    "the study of deformations of spacetime supersymmetries and the corresponding deformed superspaces were less systematic , related mostly either with the supersymmetrization of simplest abelian canonical twist deformation of poincar symmetries @xcite@xcite or with the supersymmetric extension of @xmath2-deformation @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetrization of such a canonical twist @xmath3 for @xmath4 poincare superalgebra looks as follows @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10-grading of the superalgebra element @xmath11 with definite grading .",
    "the classification of the supersymmetric triangular deformations for finite - dimensional simple lie superalgebras was firstly given in a mathematical framework by one of the present authors @xcite ; one should add also that already long time ago the nontriangular drinfeld - jimbo deformation has been provided for all complex finite - dimensional simple lie superalgebras in @xcite but without discussion of its real forms .",
    "recently however ( see @xcite ) the classification of poincar r - matrices in @xcite has been extended to @xmath12 poincare and euclidean @xcite supersymmetries , which provided physically important deformations of non - semisimple lie superalgebras .",
    "new result in this paper is the presentation of the list of d=4 n=2 classical super - poincar and super - euclidean r - matrices .",
    "we add that there were also considered twisted euclidean @xmath4 and @xmath13 supersymmetries ( see e.g. @xcite ) but only under the assumption that the fermionic part of the twist factor was a supersymmetric enlargement of canonical abelian twist ( see ( [ 1a1 ] ) ) . in our recent paper by considering partial classification of @xmath4 complex @xmath14matrices and their pseudoreal ( euclidean ) and real ( poincar ) forms @xcite we have obtained large class of @xmath4 supersymmetric twists which provide new d=4 superspaces with lie - algebraic deformation of bosonic spacetime sector .    in quantum deformations",
    "approach the basic primary notion is the hopf - algebraic deformation of ( super)symmetries which subsequently implies the modification of ( super)spacetime algebra .",
    "it follows that for classifying the possible deformations of ( super)symmetries one should list the deformations of corresponding hopf ( super)algebras . in non - supersymmetric case the most complete discussion of such hopf - algebraic approach to field theories deformed by canonical twists @xmath3 ( see ( [ 1a1 ] ) ) was presented in @xcite ; for poincar and euclidean supersymmetries such way of introducing deformations via supertwist , firstly advocated in @xcite , was presented recently in @xcite . in present paper",
