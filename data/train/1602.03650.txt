    "* the concept of assortativity is extended to couples of nodes that are not necessarily adjacent but connected through paths , walks , random walks . * a closed formula",
    "is found that can be tailored for the higher order assortativity that is of interest for any application at hand .",
    "* the newman assortativity is shown to be a particular case of all the assortativity measures we propose .",
    "* simulations show that our approach can help in revealing different topologies in networks with the same newman assortativity index .",
    "the concept of assortativity was first introduced by newman ( @xcite ) and has been studied and applied extensively to any kind of network since . as is known ,",
    "a network is said to be assortative if nodes of a certain degree tend to be connected to nodes of the same degree , for instance , high degree nodes tend to be connected to high degree nodes and low degree nodes tend to be connected to low degree nodes .",
    "a network is said to be disassortative if high degree nodes tend to be connected to low degree nodes . quoting newman , `` many networks show `` assortative mixing '' on their degrees , i.e. a preference for high degree vertices to attach to other high degree vertices .",
    "others show disassortativity mixing - high degree vertices attach to low degrees ones '' .",
    "again `` models that do not take it into account will necessarily fail to reproduce correctly many of the behaviors of real - world networked systems '' .",
    "we do agree with newman that assortativity is an important measure and for that we propose an extension that we may call higher order assortativity .",
    "assortativity is a graph metrics , i.e. related to the topology of the network and is obtained by the pearson coefficient of the degree - degree correlation vectors .",
    "in fact , by definition , the newman assortativity coefficient focuses on the degree correlation of adjacent nodes , that is , the first autocorrelation of the degree distribution . based on the adjacency matrix",
    ", it can be interpreted as a first order measure of the connection between nodes .",
    "the measure is easy to apply and may give useful hints on the network topology ( for an extensive review on assortativity see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , examples are given in the literature , where networks with apparent different topologies show the same assortativity index , or viceversa , networks with the same apparent topology show different assortativity index ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this would imply somehow that assortativity is not a good  measure , but of course it comes from its relative simplicity and in our opinion it can be efficiently used for a preliminary inspection to discover the network topology .",
    "a way of making assortativity more efficient  is to extend it theoretically and this is the core of our paper .",
    "in fact , our original contribution is meant to extend assortativity to higher order autocorrelations between nodes .",
    "we provide a unified approach to assortativity , extending it to higher order connections based on paths , shortest paths and random walks , through suitable definitions of the matrix governing the connections .",
    "we provide a closed formula , suitable for all cases we consider .",
    "our formula may be used for measuring assortativity between two not necessarily adjacent nodes but connected through paths , shortest paths or random walks .",
    "we show that the newman assortativity index comes out as a particular case for all the measures we propose . through simulations",
    "we will show that our approach helps in finding synthetic indicators for revealing the network topology .",
    "finally , we provide some hints about choosing the most suitable higher order indicator according to the network at hand and to which flow we are interested to discover .",
    "essentially , extending the concept of assortativity , that is , understanding how high degree nodes are connected to high degree nodes directly or through paths or walks , may help to better understand networks and their topology . as a consequence ,",
    "if we understand the patterns of interactions , we may leverage this knowledge to improve the flow of knowledge and information ( @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : after the literature review on extensions of assortativity and preliminaries on graph theory ( section 2 ) , we discuss how newman assortativity is obtained as the first autocorrelation of the degree - degree vector ( subsection 3.1 ) . in the following , higher order assortativity is introduced on random walks ( section 4 ) , paths and geodesics ( section 5 ) .",
    "simulations and conclusions follow .      a short literature review on assortativity",
    "mixing has been studied extensively since the paper by @xcite .",
    "the original definition of assortativity has been given in @xcite for an unweighted and undirected network .",
    "examples of assortativity applied to many real complex networks can also be found in @xcite : physics coauthorship , biology coauthorship , film actor collaborations , company directors are examples of assortative networks , while internet , www , protein interaction and neural networks are examples of disassortative networks .",
    "random graphs and barabasi - albert networks are examples of non - assortative networks . for a complete and recent review of assortativity",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "more generally , in f. da costa _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) a survey of measures of complex networks is discussed .",
    "assortativity is sometimes called homophily , when referring specifically to social networks ( @xcite ) . among the metrics related to newman assortativity",
    ", we quote the zagreb index or s(g ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . alderson _",
    "( @xcite ) discuss the s(g ) metric and scale - free graphs .",
    "they provide examples of networks having the same degree sequence with an apparent different topology and introduce s(g ) as indicators for discriminating network topologies . in @xcite many measures are used and accompany assortativity .",
    "the authors employ the @xmath0series , a set of characteristics of the network topology , to study the statistical dependencies between different network properties . through the @xmath0series , they study the average degree , assortativity , clustering and so on . from an empirical point of view , @xcite developed and executed an algorithm to evaluate degree correlation between nodes separated by more than one step .",
    "through shortest paths , they studied three online social networks and compared their long range degree correlation behavior to those of three non - social networks by measuring both the average number of neighbors and calculating the pearson correlation score .",
    "authors conclude that results are not clear cut and require further investigation .",
    "many other measures are used and accompany assortativity , such as in @xcite .",
    "a discussion on how appropriate the pearson coefficient is for comparing mixing patterns in networks of a different size can be found in @xcite .",
    "they show that the pearson coefficient in scale - free networks decreases with the network size , thus making impossible to compare , for example , two web crawls of different sizes .",
    "alternatively , they suggest a degree - degree dependency measure based on spearman s rho @xcite .",
    "although assortativity is such an important feature and so popular in the complex networks world , as far as the authors know , no attempts have been made to extend such a measure to a theoretical and unifying view .",
    "we quickly recall some standard definitions about graph theory . we will assume familiarity with basic theoretical concepts ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "all these alternative definitions can be modelled using our unified approach through suitable definitions of matrix @xmath87 to this aim , the formula ( [ pearson coeff ] ) can be used to measure the assortativity between two not necessarily adjacent nodes but connected through random walks , paths and shortest paths .",

    "moreover , similarly to the newman assortativity ( [ newman ] ) , if @xmath81 is a regular graph , the assortativity of order @xmath88 ( @xmath98 ) is undefined .",
    "a possible application of higher order assortativity through random walks can be found in an input - ouput network ( see @xcite ) , where the movement of goods between the sectors of an economy is modeled as a random walk .",
    "goods , like random walkers , start out at a given position and repeatedly choose an edge incident to their current position .",
    "the choices are made according to a probability distribution determined by the edge weights .",
    "the goods proceed for an arbitrarily long time or until a prescribed goal is reached . from formula ( [ pearson coeff rw ] )",
    "we may be able to track down the movements of those goods .",
    "in this section we define a new measure of assortativity based on paths of length @xmath107 the newman assortativity measure will be extended by taking into account not only the direct connection between two nodes ( i.e. the adjacency ) but also the higher order neighborhood structure of the network through paths .",
    "being the graph @xmath21 connected , two nodes @xmath94 and @xmath95 are always linked by a path of some length @xmath88 .",
