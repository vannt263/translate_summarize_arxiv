    "hunting the higgs boson(s ) is the highest priority of the international high - energy physics programme .",
    "the standard model - like higgs boson should have a mass between the lep2 limit of 114  gev and the upper bound of about 200  gev , which is favoured by electroweak data  @xcite . within the mssm",
    ", the light scalar higgs boson is expected to be lighter than about 135 gev , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the focus now is on searching for the higgs at present and forthcoming hadron colliders , namely the tevatron and the lhc .    to ascertain whether a higgs signal can be seen , it is crucial to show that the background does not overwhelm the signal .",
    "for instance , the major difficulty in observing inclusive production of the higgs in the preferred mass range around 115  gev via the dominant @xmath6 mode is the huge @xmath1 qcd background . in order to rescue the @xmath1 higgs signal different options",
    "have been proposed in the literature . an attractive possibility to reduce",
    "the background is to study the central production of the higgs in events with a large rapidity gap on either side , see for example [ 314 ] .",
    "an obvious advantage of the rapidity gap approach is the clean experimental signature  hadron free zones between the remnants of the incoming protons and the higgs decay products .",
    "the cleanest situation is in the double - diffractive exclusive process : @xmath7 where the plus sign denotes a large rapidity gap .",
    "however the cross section is expected to be rather small  @xcite , and as a consequence , the corresponding event rate appears to be too low at the tevatron . only at",
    "the lhc is there a chance of observing this exclusive higgs production process  @xcite .",
    "various effects cause a drastic reduction of the cross section for process  ( [ excl ] ) , for details see  @xcite .",
    "first , the proton form factors strongly limit the available phase space in the transverse momentum of the produced higgs , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the proton radius .",
    "secondly , we have to account for the probability @xmath10 that the gaps survive the soft rescattering effects of spectator partons which may populate the gaps with secondary particles , see for example  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the cross section is also suppressed by qcd sudakov - like radiative effects  @xcite .",
    "the cross section is larger in the semi - inclusive case when the protons may dissociate , @xmath11 but the higgs is still isolated by rapidity gaps . in this case there is no proton form factor suppression and the qcd  radiation damage \" becomes weaker .",
    "moreover , a significant contribution to process  ( [ semi_inc ] ) comes from higgs production via @xmath12 fusion , i.e. @xmath13 . since this process is mediated by colourless @xmath14-channel @xmath15 exchanges there is no corresponding gluon bremsstrahlung in the central region  @xcite , and thus sudakov suppression of the rapidity gaps does not occur .",
    "another characteristic feature of the vector boson fusion higgs production process is that it is accompanied by energetic quark jets in the forward and backward directions .",
    "recently , interest in this type of higgs production process at the lhc has risen rapidly , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the particular importance of the electroweak fusion process is that it allows a determination of the higgs coupling to vector bosons .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the @xmath12 fusion mechanism can provide a potential way to identify @xmath6 decays at the lhc , if particular kinematic configurations with large rapidity gaps are selected , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the most delicate issue in calculating the cross section for processes with rapidity gaps concerns the soft survival factor @xmath10 .",
    "this factor has been calculated in a number of models for various rapidity gap processes , see for example  @xcite .",
    "although there is reasonable agreement between these model expectations , it is always difficult to guarantee the precision of predictions which rely on soft physics .",
    "fortunately , the calculations of @xmath10 can be checked experimentally by computing the event rate for a suitable calibrating reaction and comparing with the observed rate .",
    "as shown in  @xcite the appropriate monitoring process for the double - diffractive mechanism is central dijet production with a rapidity gap on either side . to date , such a check has been the prediction of diffractive dijet production at the tevatron in terms of the diffractive structure functions measured at hera  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the survival factor @xmath10 based on the formalism of  @xcite appears to be in remarkable agreement with the cdf data ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that future measurements in run ii of the tevatron will provide us with further detailed information on @xmath10 .",
    "as was pointed out in  @xcite , the survival factor for the gaps surrounding @xmath16 fusion can be monitored experimentally by observing the closely related central production of a @xmath17 boson with the same rapidity gap and jet configuration .",
    "the discussion in  @xcite concerns the studies of @xmath18 forward jet production with subsequent leptonic @xmath0 decay in association with a rapidity gap trigger , which could allow a substantial suppression of the qcd - induced backgrounds .",
    "it is worthwhile to keep in mind that in different papers different criteria are used for the definition of the rapidity gaps .",
    "for example , in the approach of  @xcite no jets with @xmath19  gev are permitted within the gaps , while in  @xcite the gap is required to be completely devoid of any soft hadrons .",
    "note that the determination of the gap survival factor in the vector boson mediated process is interesting in its own right , since here we can separate the contribution of the short transverse size component of the proton  @xcite , which so far has not attracted much attention , either theoretically or experimentally .",
    "the reader should be warned about the potential problems with the identification of rapidity gaps in the real life experimental environment at the lhc .",
    "when the lhc operates at medium and high luminosity , the recorded events will be plagued by overlap interactions in the same bunch crossing ( pile - up ) .",
    "however , as discussed in  @xcite , at least at the medium luminosity of @xmath20 the gaps should be detectable . using vertex reconstruction information , one can separate particles originating from the same vertex as the high-@xmath21 jets from those relatively low-@xmath22 particles which arise from other vertices corresponding to the pile - up interactions . however , it is quite unlikely that this technique can be used for the super - lhc luminosity of @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we develop the ideas of  @xcite further by considering the decays of both ( light ) higgs and @xmath0 bosons into @xmath24 pairs , the dominant decay channel of the former  jet production process . ] . in each case",
    "we require two forward energetic jets , and rapidity gaps on either side of the centrally produced decay products .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath0 can be produced by electroweak vector boson fusion , for which gaps are ` natural ' , but the @xmath0 can also be produced via @xmath25 qcd processes , with both quarks and gluons exchanged in the @xmath14-channel , but as we shall see these have a smaller soft survival factor .",
    "finally , there is a potentially large continuum @xmath24 background , which is again heavily suppressed when rapidity gaps are required .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : partoncalc ] we discuss the calculation of the various signal and background processes at the parton level . in section",
    "[ sec : partonchar ] we perform detailed numerical calculations with realistic experimental cuts to determine the corresponding cross sections . in section  [ sec : gap ] we explore the consequences of hadronisation and estimate the gap survival probabilities , @xmath26 , for the various processes under consideration .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : results ] we combine the parton - level cross sections with the gap survival probabilities to give our final predictions for the cross sections .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] summarises our conclusions .",
    "in this section we assemble the various parton - level cross sections that are used in our analysis .",
    "we are particularly interested in the overall event rates for the various signal and background processes , and in the kinematic distributions of the final - state particles .",
    "all matrix elements used in the cross - section calculations are obtained using madgraph  @xcite . in all cases we work in the zero width approximation for the centrally - produced bosons .",
    "we begin by considering the fundamental signal process , @xmath27 higgs production by @xmath28 , @xmath29 fusion : @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "we assume that the higgs is light , so that the dominant decay is into the @xmath31 final state .",
    "because the momentum transfer is much smaller than the energy of the struck quark jets(@xmath32 ) , the jets are produced predominantly at small angle ( i.e. large rapidity ) .",
    "note that there is no exchange of colour in the @xmath14-channel , which leads to a suppression of hadronic radiation in the central region between the forward jets  @xcite .",
    "representative feynman diagrams for the analogous @xmath27 @xmath0 production process , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are shown in fig .",

    "[ zew](a ) , the @xmath0 can also be radiated off either of the incoming or outgoing quark lines , figs .  [ zew](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the characteristic topology of ( b ) is of a @xmath0 preferentially produced in the forward or backward region close in rapidity to one of the final - state quark jets . requiring _ centrally _ produced @xmath0 decay products tends to suppress this contribution .",
    "process ( c ) corresponds to @xmath35-channel production of the final - state @xmath36 pair , with the @xmath0 boson emitted off the incoming quark lines .",
    "it does not correspond to @xmath14-channel colour singlet exchange and is heavily kinematically suppressed by requiring a large rapidity separation between the jets .",
    "similar remarks apply to @xmath3 production .",
    "representative feynman diagrams for @xmath37 are shown in fig .",
    "note that the central @xmath3-production via @xmath38 exchange corresponding to fig .",
    "[ qqw]a was recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the above @xmath27 @xmath2 and @xmath0 production processes both therefore give rise to rapidity gap signatures between the forward jets and the central @xmath2 and @xmath0 decay products .",
    "however there is a potentially important qcd @xmath39 background contribution to @xmath402  jet production where the internal electroweak gauge boson is replaced by a _",
    "gluon_. more generally , at this order indistinguishable background contributions can arise from any @xmath41 scattering process ( other than @xmath42 ) where the @xmath0 is radiated off a quark line .",

    "[ zqcd ] . by selecting forward jets and central @xmath0 bosons , in order to mimic the dominant higgs configuration ,",
    "the @xmath14-channel momentum transfer is minimised , and these qcd processes split into two types : @xmath14-channel quark ( figs .",
    "[ zqcd](a , b , c ) ) and gluon exchange ( figs .",
    "[ zqcd](d ) ) .",
    "requiring rapidity gaps therefore suppresses both type of contribution , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : gap ] below .",
    "finally , given that we are interested in the @xmath43 decay modes of both the higgs and @xmath0 bosons , with two additional jets in the final state , there is a class of @xmath44 pure - qcd background processes of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 , examples of which are shown in fig .",
    "we will consider the corresponding cross sections in the following section , with the additional requirement that @xmath47 .",
    "in this section we calculate cross sections and kinematic distributions for the processes described in the previous section , for proton - proton collisions at the lhc using a representative set of cuts on the final state particles .",
    "we have in mind final states with a jet registered in a forward detector with pseudorapidity @xmath48 , another produced backwards with @xmath49 , and the @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 decay products produced centrally , with rapidity @xmath50 .",
    "we impose a minimum transverse momentum cut @xmath51 on all final - state jets .",
    "figure  [ totx ] shows the total cross section for higgs , electroweak @xmath0 and @xmath3 , and qcd @xmath0 production ( with no branching ratios included ) as a function of a cut on the minimum transverse jet momentum @xmath51 .",
    "the higgs mass is @xmath52  gev and the leading - order mrst98lo @xcite parton distribution set is used .",
    "note that only for @xmath2 production is the cross section finite in the limit @xmath53 channel gives rise to an infrared singularity in the electroweak and qcd @xmath402  jet production processes as @xmath53 , see figs .",

    "in addition , the possibility that the final state jets in @xmath0 and @xmath3 production originate in the splitting process @xmath56 ( for example , see fig .",
    "[ zew](c ) ) requires a jet separation cut .",
    "the minimal way to do this is simply to require that one of the jets is produced in the forward hemisphere and the other in the backward hemisphere , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "when we come to consider ` realistic ' cuts , in particular to isolate the jets from each other and the @xmath2 and @xmath0 decay products , we will impose a large rapidity separation cut in which one jet is produced far forward and one far backward : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "for the higgs production process , which has no infrared or collinear singularities , the imposition of @xmath51 and @xmath60 acceptance cuts simply reduces the cross section slightly ( by approximately 25% for a broad range of @xmath51 values ) , see fig .",

    "the cuts reduce the @xmath0 production qcd background by a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "as already mentioned , in evaluating the pure qcd @xmath1 production cross sections we further impose the restriction that the dijet invariant mass be within @xmath103 gev of @xmath104 .",
    "in the previous sections we have presented cross sections for higgs , z and qcd @xmath1 production processes for events with rapidity gaps at the parton level . we take the definition of rapidity gap to mean that there should be no minijets with a large ( @xmath105  gev ) transverse momentum within the gap region .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the selection of rapidity gap events improves the signal to background ratio because gaps are a characteristic feature of the vector boson fusion process , whereas they are not for qcd @xmath0 and continuum @xmath1 production .",
    "of course , the results presented in the previous section should be corrected to account for the rescattering of spectator partons , that is the possibility that another pair of initial , fast partons interacts inelastically in the same event .",

    "this can be done by requiring a _ completely clean _ gap , i.e. without any soft hadrons .",
    "indeed , all the qcd processes we consider are characterised by gluon ( or quark ) @xmath14-channel exchange , which unavoidably produces a colour flow along the gap . during hadronisation",

    ", there is no such effect for the electroweak graphs ( figs .",
    "[ h ] ,  [ zew]a , [ zew]b ) since the vector boson exchange is colourless .",
    "this means that if we require clean hadron - level gaps we can immediately discard the diagrams of fig .",
    "the only way to create a gap in a qcd induced event is to screen the colour flow ( across the gap ) by an additional gluon ( or quark ) exchange ; that is , to consider graphs of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ screen ] .",
    "note that in leading order we can screen the colour flow in both gaps ( above and below the @xmath1-pair ) with only one additional @xmath14-channel gluon , with momentum @xmath109 say .",

    "the major contribution comes from the small @xmath109 region where the qcd coupling @xmath110 is larger .",
    "moreover , the integral takes the form @xmath113 and has infrared logarithmic divergence at @xmath114 .",
    "however , this divergence is cut off by the effects of higher order double logarithmic qcd radiation , see for example  @xcite .",

    "hard ' gluon @xmath116 may emit a new ` semihard ' gluon jet , with transverse energy @xmath21 ranging from @xmath109 up to @xmath117 in the whole rapidity gap interval @xmath118 .",
    "the leading logarithms come from the @xmath119 domain where the expected mean number of these secondary gluons is @xmath120 at the amplitude level the corresponding suppression factor describing the probability for not having such an emission ( which otherwise destroys the gap ) has the sudakov - like form @xmath121 including this factor in the loop integral , we eliminate the infrared divergence and obtain the probability , @xmath122 ( @xmath123 depending on the initial state ) , to screen out the octet ( gluon - like ) colour flow in @xmath124 ( @xmath125 or @xmath126 ) interactions , @xmath127 here @xmath128 is the overall length of the gaps and , within leading logarithm accuracy , we have put the upper limits in the @xmath129 integration equal to the minimum @xmath106 of the jets . in order to arrive at the right - hand side of   it",
    "is convenient to recast the integral in   as @xmath130 with @xmath131 performing the integration we neglect the term @xmath132 corresponding to the lower limit of integration .",
    "this can always be done safely if we can continue the perturbative calculation down to the ( rather low ) scale where the quantity @xmath133 becomes large . instead of the conventional double logarithm expressions ( ) with a fixed coupling @xmath110 , in we have used the running coupling in order to demonstrate that the result does not depend on whether one accounts for the running @xmath110 or not .",
    "the colour factors @xmath134 are @xmath135    a more precise way to calculate the contributions of including qcd radiative effects is to replace the two gluon @xmath14-channel exchange by the non - forward bfkl amplitude  @xcite .",

    "thus we come back to the result of . strictly speaking , besides the suppression factor hidden in the bfkl amplitude , there should be another sudakov - like double logarithmic form factor which reflects the absence of qcd radiation in the interval of gluon transverse momentum between @xmath139 and half of the boson ( or @xmath1 ) mass , @xmath140 .",
    "however , in our case the transverse momentum of the jets is @xmath141  gev , which is close to half the boson mass @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the form factor becomes close to one and we can neglect it .",
    "another point we have to take into account is the fact that now the @xmath1-pair may be produced in a colour singlet state only , and the ordinary @xmath143 hard subprocess cross section ( which includes both colour singlet and octet contributions ) should be replaced by the pure colour singlet cross section  @xcite @xmath144,\\ ] ] where @xmath145 and @xmath146 is the quark mass .",
    "note that for the colour singlet production case there is an additional colour factor @xmath147 which suppresses the qcd background , as the two colliding gluons are forced to have the same colour .",

    "[ zqcd]a , b , c amplitude contribution ) by the factor @xmath149 ( i.e. a factor @xmath150 in the cross section ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the loop with two @xmath14-channel fermions may contain a double logarithm ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "one logarithm comes from the transverse ( @xmath109 ) integration , while another logarithm ( in the real part of the amplitude ) originates from the @xmath151 integral over the ( virtual ) mass of the upper @xmath35-channel particle in the loop ( assuming that the contour of the feynman integral is closed on the pole corresponding to the lower @xmath35-channel particle ) . in our kinematics , where a @xmath0 boson is emitted in the centre of the rapidity gap interval , we obtain a logarithm when the mass , @xmath152 , runs from @xmath153 up to @xmath154 ( here @xmath155 is the incoming parton energy squared and @xmath156 ) .",
    "that is , the mass integral gives @xmath157 .",
    "the @xmath109 integration does not give a logarithm in the case of fig .",
    "[ screenq]a , but for the amplitudes corresponding to fig .",
    "[ screenq]b , c , a logarithmic integral appears in the domain @xmath158 .",
    "thus from the fig .  [",
    "screenq]b , c loop integrals we may expect a @xmath159 enhancement . however , with our large rapidity gap ( @xmath160 ) the whole factor ",
    "@xmath161^{2 } = 0.45(\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{\\pi})^{2}\\sim 10^{-3}$ ] is very small . besides this , after the parton - level cuts described in section  [ subsec",
    ": dist ] are applied , the original parton - level contribution of the diagrams with a ( @xmath14-channel ) quark exchange is strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore we neglect these contributions .      returning to our original processes ,",
    "we keep now only the graphs with either vector boson or two gluon ( fig .",
    "[ screen ] ) exchange across the rapidity gaps , and multiply the corresponding parton - level cross sections by the appropriate gap survival probability @xmath26 .",
    "however , as we now require there to be no hadrons ( even with a rather low @xmath106 ) in the gap interval , we have to take account of any soft interactions of the spectator partons .    instead of using a monte carlo simulation ,",
    "it is better to choose a model based on regge ( pomeron ) theory tuned to describe soft interaction data at high energies .",
    "we will use the model of ref .",
    "this is based on the two - channel eikonal formalism , which reproduces all the main features of the soft ( @xmath162 , @xmath163 ) cross section data in the isr  tevatron energy range .",
    "recall that the two channels of the eikonal correspond to two eigenstates which have different absorptive cross sections ( i.e. different rescattering probabilities ) .",
    "assuming the same ( momentum and spatial ) distributions of quarks and gluons in both components of the incoming proton wavefunction ( that is , in both eigenstates of the eikonal ) the model predicts for all our processes @xmath164 at lhc energies .",
    "in other words , by requiring gaps at the hadron level we decrease the cross section by an order of magnitude . at first sight ,",
    "the gap survival probability @xmath164 reflects the rescattering of soft spectator partons and should , therefore , be universal for any process which has a gap .",
    "however , this is not completely true .",
    "first , the value of @xmath26 depends on the spatial distribution of parton spectators and therefore on the characteristic impact parameter ( @xmath165 ) difference between the two colliding protons  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of exclusive higgs boson production , @xmath166 via photon - photon fusion , the transverse momenta of the photons are very small .",
    "hence the impact parameter @xmath165 is very large .",
    "the probability of soft rescattering in such a highly peripheral collision is small , and the value of @xmath26 ( @xmath167 ) is close to one  @xcite .",
    "secondly , there is a difference in the momentum distributions of partons in a different ( diffractive eigenstate ) component of the incoming proton wavefunction ; it is reasonable to expect that the component with a smaller cross section contains more valence quarks ( and ` hard ' large-@xmath168 partons ) , whereas the component with a larger cross section has more low-@xmath168 gluons .",
    "this possibility was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "in such an approach , the model describes the breakdown of factorisation , in that there is about a factor @xmath103 difference between the ` effective ' pomeron structure functions measured in diffractive deeply inelastic interactions at hera and diffractive high-@xmath21 dijet hadroproduction at the tevatron  @xcite for proton - antiproton collisions , whereas @xmath169 in deep inelastic scattering . ] .    in the present context , as the background @xmath1-pairs are produced predominantly in gluon - gluon collisions , the gap survival probability for the qcd background is a little smaller than for @xmath0(@xmath2)-boson production via vector boson fusion where we deal with incoming quark - quark interactions ( see ) . using the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain for the kinematics ( cuts ) described in section  [ sec : partonchar ] , @xmath170 these survival factors are much larger than in the original model  @xcite because for the case considered here , of large rapidity gaps and large jet transverse momenta , we select mainly fast incoming partons and valence quarks which belong to the second component of the proton wavefunction . this component has a smaller absorptive cross section ) component while gluons and sea quarks are concentrated in the first component ( with a larger cross section ) we get @xmath171 ] in this case the qcd background is additionally suppressed @xmath172 times . note that both versions of the model  @xcite describe the diffractive dijet cdf data  @xcite well enough . on the other hand , in processes with large rapidity gaps at the lhc the uncertainty in the soft survival factor",
    "@xmath26 may be rather large .",
    "it will therefore be important to study such a process experimentally . a promising way to study the survival probability @xmath26 in different components of the incoming proton wave function (",
    "i.e. the dependence of @xmath26 on the @xmath139 and rapidity cuts ) is to measure qcd dijet production with rapidity gaps on either side of the dijet pair . here",
    "the cross section is much larger ( especially for gluon - gluon induced dijets ) and it is easy to study the gap survival factor @xmath26 under the various kinematic conditions : @xmath106 of the fast ( large @xmath173 ) jets , size of the rapidity gaps , dijet mass , etc . in this way we can emphasise the rle of the incoming valence quarks , sea quarks or gluons in different @xmath168 and scale @xmath174 domains , and hence choose the configuration where one or other component of the wavefunction dominates .",
    "note that , depending on the jet - finding algorithm , some soft hadrons may or may not be attributed to a particular @xmath91-jet .",
    "therefore , one has to be more specific in the definition of the rapidity gap on the hadronic level in the presence of the high-@xmath106 jets .",
    "it looks plausible to select the gap by the requirement not to have hadrons within the gap range , apart from the cones of a fixed size @xmath175 around the jet directions . in a real life experiment",
    ", jet - finding algorithms should be utilised in optimising the value of @xmath176 .",
    "soft survival factors @xmath26 are practically independent of the @xmath176 value at @xmath177 .",
    "shows the cross sections after hadronisation for central production of higgs or @xmath0 with rapidity gaps and subsequent decay to @xmath1 as a function of @xmath51 of the proton remnant jets .",
    "it also shows the expected background of qcd @xmath1 events that display the same kinematical configuration .",
    "these are calculated using as a starting point the parton level cross sections after application of cuts , namely figure  [ cut_sig_h ] for higgs production and figure  [ cut_sig_z ] for @xmath0 production .",
    "the qcd - induced cross sections ( both the qcd @xmath0 production of d and the direct qcd @xmath1 production of ) are then multiplied by the probability to screen out the colour octet contribution for the relevant initial state of either @xmath124 , @xmath126 or @xmath125 ( ) . to take into account the fact that the @xmath1 pair in the background processes can only be produced in the colour singlet state the ordinary @xmath143 cross section is replaced by the pure singlet cross section , .",
    "finally both the signals and backgrounds are multiplied by the relevant soft survival probability of .",
    "we see that , as long as we stay away from the low @xmath51 region , the signal for higgs production is comparable with the qcd background , even exceeding it above @xmath178  gev .",
    "the cross section for @xmath0 production with rapidity gaps is less than that for higgs production over most of the plot .",
    "this is because the branching fraction to @xmath1 is much lower than for the higgs .",
    "exceptions to this occur at low @xmath51 where the effect of the infrared singularity makes its presence felt and at very high @xmath51 , explained by the fact that the parton - level higgs cross section falls more rapidly , as shown in .",
    "the backgrounds show an extremely strong dependence on @xmath51 , falling by five orders of magnitude as one varies @xmath51 from @xmath179  gev to @xmath180  gev .",
    "the qcd @xmath1 background with the invariant mass of the @xmath1 pair taken around the @xmath0 mass is approximately @xmath181 higher than that evaluated around the higgs mass .",
    "it should be noted that in these calculations we have taken @xmath182 .",
    "an argument could also be made that the characteristic scale should be that of the transverse momenta of the forward jets , i.e. @xmath183 .",
    "this would affect the @xmath184 backgrounds in such a way as to increase them by approximately @xmath185 if we take the typical @xmath106 to be @xmath186  gev .",
    "let us emphasise that up to now we have not addressed the experimental issues . in particular , the predictions given in fig .",
    "[ final_plot ] should be modified to account for the @xmath91-tagging efficiency @xmath187 .",
    "this , in turn , is correlated with the probability @xmath188 to misidentify a gluon ( or a light quark ) jet as a @xmath91-jet .",
    "recall that the rate of the @xmath125-dijets exceeds the @xmath1-yield by two orders of magnitude . as discussed in @xcite , it is feasible to expect for the two @xmath91-jets @xmath189 with @xmath190 .",
    "the weak boson fusion mechanism can provide a promising way to detect a light higgs boson at the lhc , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the selection of events with large rapidity gaps and energetic large @xmath22 ( quark ) jets in the forward and backward directions allows the suppression of the qcd @xmath1 background down to a level comparable to the signal .",
    "therefore , it becomes feasible to observe a light higgs boson via its main @xmath6 decay mode in addition to the usually discussed @xmath191 and @xmath192 channels , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the production of a @xmath193 gev higgs boson in association with rapidity gaps at the lhc is expected to be about @xmath194 fb ( for @xmath195  gev ) .",
    "therefore , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath196 planned for the first two or three years of lhc running , about 400 events can be observed .",
    "note that our cuts were not finally optimised for the particular atlas / cms conditions .",
    "thus , the significance of the signal may be improved by allowing asymmetric configurations with some minimal @xmath197 between the high-@xmath106 jets instead of the requirement @xmath198 , @xmath199 .",
    "such a kinematical choice was considered , for instance , in ref .",
    "it is shown that this will noticeably improve the significance of the signal .",
    "an important ingredient in the evaluation of both the signal and the background in the @xmath200 forward jet events is the soft survival factor @xmath10 , defining the probability that the gaps survive the soft @xmath201-scattering .",
    "recall that though this factor can be computed within the framework of existing models for soft rescattering , it is always unwise to rely on the precision of models based on soft physics .",
    "fortunately , the soft survival factor for the gaps surrounding @xmath16 fusion can be monitored experimentally by observing the closely related central production of a @xmath0 boson with the same rapidity gap and jet configuration  @xcite .",
    "as was emphasised in  @xcite , the @xmath191 and @xmath192 decay channels with rapidity gap kinematics can give a rather high significance for the observation of a light higgs .",
    "in the @xmath191 case the main background results from the tail in the @xmath191 mass distribution generated by the @xmath202 decay .",
    "again , the experimental observation of @xmath0 boson central production allows one to control and monitor such a background .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the experimental determination of the gap survival factor in the processes under consideration is interesting in its own right , since it provides important information on the incoming proton wavefunction .",
    "note that since the incoming partons in the subprocess @xmath203 are rather hard , the factor @xmath10 depends on the model assumptions more sensitively than , for example , in the exclusive diffractive production case @xmath204 , see  @xcite . as was demonstrated in section  [ subsec : ssp ] ( see footnote@xmath205 ) the results strongly depend on how the partons in the proton are distributed between the different diffractive eigenstates .",
    "currently our information on these distributions is rather limited .",
    "this paper concentrates on the detailed analysis of central @xmath0 boson production accompanied by rapidity gaps on either side and two forward jets at the lhc .",
    "the qcd background processes for @xmath206 jet production in the rapidity gap environment are addressed in detail .",
    "we evaluate the soft survival factors @xmath10 for various processes under consideration .",
    "finally , we note that it will be important to extend our work by incorporating a realistic monte carlo simulation , which will allow detector simulation to be included .",
    "we believe that the results presented in this paper make such an effort worthwhile .",
