    "the high - pressure phase of solid molecular hydrogen is very complex .",
    "nevertheless , due to its relevance to astrophysics @xcite , the possible existence of high-@xmath1 superconductivity @xcite and a metallic quantum fluid ground state @xcite , the importance to grasp metallic hydrogen can hardly be overstated . however , since hydrogen atoms are very light , their x - ray scattering is extremely weak , leading to extremely low - resolution diffraction patterns @xcite .",
    "this makes it particularly challenging to determine the crystalline structure of solid hydrogen at high pressure .",
    "experiments based on vibrational techniques , such as raman and infrared ( ir ) spectroscopies , have identified four different solid phases ( i , ii , iii and iv ) of molecular hydrogen at megabar pressures ( 100@xmath2300 gpa ) and different temperature ranges @xcite .",
    "the low pressure phase ( @xmath3 110 gpa ) is denoted as phase i and consists of freely rotating hydrogen molecules on an hexagonal close - packed lattice .",
    "the low temperature structures at pressures above 110 gpa , known as phase ii and iii , are still unknown @xcite , just like the recently discovered phase iv that is stable at temperatures well above the nuclear ground state @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the combination of scattering and vibrational spectroscopy measurements only reveal the state of bonding of the hydrogen atoms , but are not sufficient to uniquely determine the corresponding crystal structures .",
    "even though it is generally still impossible to ensure that a particular structure corresponds to the global minimum in enthalpy , recently great strides have been made to predict crystal structures from first - principles , to the extend that allowed pickard and needs to systematically investigate the zero - temperature phase diagram of solid molecular hydrogen by means of theory .",
    "in particular , they suggested the c2/c phase to be energetically most favorable for the pressure range of phase iii @xcite . at variance , based on more accurate hybrid density functional theory ( dft ) calculations that includes some fraction of exact hartree - fock exchange , azadi and khne predicted the p6@xmath0/m to be the most likely candidate for phase iii of solid hydrogen @xcite . even more accurate quantum monte carlo calculations , including the harmonic part of the zero - point energy ( zpe ) , also indicates that the p6@xmath0/m phase obeys the lowest enthalpy up to 220 gpa , whereas for higher pressures the c2/c structure is enthalpically most favorable @xcite .",
    "however , the differences in enthalpy within these structures are very small and nuclear quantum effects ( nqe ) , such as the zpe , relatively large , which puts rather stringent accuracy requirements on the calculation of both contributions .",
    "while the former is typically calculated using dft , the latter is often estimated using the quasi - harmonic approximation . yet",
    "both of them have recently been shown to be not accurate enough for the reliable prediction of high - pressure crystal structures .",
    "on the one hand azadi et al .",
    "have shown that an electronic structure theory beyond dft is essential @xcite , whereas on the other hand ceperley and coworkers demonstrated the importance of anharmonic zpe and the significance of finite temperature effects @xcite . unfortunately , combining path - integral molecular dynamics , which exactly accounts for finite temperature and nqe , with an accurate electronic structure technique beyond dft is computational still not feasible .",
    "therefore , in this paper we follow a different approach and consider anharmonic finite temperature effects by means of dft - based born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics ( bomd ) simulations at room temperature @xcite .",
    "however , we do not attempt here to determine the most likely candidate structure in the pressure range of phase iii by averaging the enthalpy from accurate electronic structure calculations .",
    "instead , we calculate here the ensemble averages of the raman and ir spectra , which are much more sensitive to structural changes , and compare them directly to experimental measurements at room temperature to assign the structure of phase iii of solid molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "we considered here the c2 , c2/c , cmca-12 , pbcn and p6@xmath0/m phases , which have all been found to be enthalpically competitive candidate structures for phase iii of solid molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the supercell of the latter structure consisted of 64 hydrogen molecules , whereas all the others supercells contained 48 hydrogen molecules , respectively .",
    "all of our dft calculations were performed using the projector augmented - wave method , as implemented in quantum espresso @xcite .",
    "we employed the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation to the exchange and correlation energy @xcite .",
    "the bomd simulations were conducted in the isobaric - isothermal npt ensemble , i.e. at constant pressure ( 250  gpa ) and temperature ( 200  k and 300  k ) .",
    "each of the simulations were initially equilibrated for 5  ps before accumulating statistics for another 15  ps using an integration timestep of 8 a.u .",
    "( 1 a.u.= 0.0484  fs ) .",
    "it is important to note that in this way nqe are neglected .",
    "nevertheless , since nqe are at finite temperature much smaller than at the nuclear ground - state and furthermore primarily influence the relative stability of the various crystal phases rather than the raman and ir spectra , the effect on the eventual structure determination can be assumed to be small .    for the purpose to calculate the nuclear forces for the bomd simulation ,",
    "we have employed a plane wave basis set with an energy cut - off of 680  ev and a 2@xmath42@xmath42 monkhorst - pack k - point mesh to sample the first brillouin zone @xcite . beside calculating the raman and ir spectra , the electronic density of states ( edos ) and the electronic band gaps at the nuclear ground state at 0  k , we have also calculated them at finite temperature as ensemble averages of 200 equidistantly selected configurations from our bomd simulations . to that",
    "extend we used an energy cutoff of 816 ev and a dense 18@xmath5 k - point mesh to compute the edos and the band gaps , whereas a rather hard norm - conserving ( nc ) pseudopotential @xcite with a cutoff of 1360  ev and the perdew - zunger ( pz81 ) exchange and correlation functional @xcite had been employed to calculate the raman and ir spectra .",
    "optimized structures were obtained through minimizing the enthalpy when simultaneously varying the atomic positions and the simulation cell by a dynamical simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "the spectra were all calculated at the @xmath6-point only using density - functional perturbation theory and its third - order extension based on the ` @xmath7 ' rule to compute the anharmonic cubic coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the main constraints that are used to identify the various phases of solid molecular hydrogen comes from experimental vibrational spectroscopy measurements .",
    "the lattice vibration modes due to low - frequency intermolecular interactions are denoted as librons , while the high - frequency intramolecular stretching modes are known as vibrons .",
    "the pressure induced transition from phase ii to phase iii can be identified in the raman spectrum by a large discontinuous drop of the raman vibron frequency @xcite followed by a continuous decrease upon further increase in pressure @xcite .",
    "this indicates not only strong intermolecular interactions , but also the presence of orientational ordering in phase iii .",
    "furthermore , phase iii obeys multiple low - frequency raman - active modes @xcite , whereas the frequency of the highest raman - active libron increases with pressure @xcite .",
    "however , it is also possible to detect the pressure induced phase ii to iii transition within experimental ir spectra by a discontinuous drop in frequency of the ir - active vibrons @xcite . increasing the pressure even further leads to a large increase in the intensity of the ir - active vibrons @xcite and to a decrease in the frequency of the ir - active vibrons @xcite .",
    "the distinction between _ para _ and _ ortho _ hydrogen molecules is herein of minor importance , due to the rather small rotational freedom of the individual molecules @xcite .",
    "all of the structures considered here consists of hydrogen molecules arranged in layers , though each time with a different stacking . in any case , the centers of the molecules lie on a distorted hexagonal lattice .",
    "the individual layers of the p6@xmath0/m and cmca-12 phases are stacked in a aba fashion , whereas the c2/c structure obeys a abcda stacking . at variance , the c2 and pbcn phases are mixed layered structures made of alternating layers of strongly and weakly bonded hydrogen molecules .",
    "however , initial raman and ir spectra calculations immediately suggest that the latter mixed layered phases are inconsistent with phase iii of solid molecular hydrogen .",
    "henceforth , we will confine ourselves to the c2/c , p6@xmath0/m and cmca-12 phases only and will discuss the c2 and pbcn structures in a forthcoming paper on phase iv of solid hydrogen @xcite .",
    "except for the p6@xmath0/m phase , where three - quarters of the hydrogen molecules are planar , while one quarter of the molecules are oriented perpendicular to the plane , in all other structures the hydrogen molecules are arranged in - plane .",
    "the calculated raman spectra as a function of pressure of the c2/c , p6@xmath0/m and cmca-12 phases at their respective nuclear ground states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raman-0k ] . in comparison to the p6@xmath0/m phase ,",

    "however , experimentally only one ir - active vibron mode is observed , whereas the c2/c and cmca-12 phases have each two ir - active vibron modes .",
    "thus , the p6@xmath0/m structure , which possess only one ir - active vibron mode , is the only composition that is in agreement with an earlier group theoretical analysis @xcite .",

    "in addition , the low - frequency librons of the c2/c structure are in qualitative agreement with the experimental ones , while the agreement of the p6@xmath0/m phase is rather poor . however , the linewidth of the raman - active vibron of all probed crystal structures is very large compared with the experimental value of about 100 @xmath9 , which is most likely due to an overestimation of the anharmonic proton motion by the present semi - classical bomd simulations .",

    "even though the ir - active vibrons of both , the c2/c and the p6@xmath0/m configurations are now consistent with the experimental measured ones , the agreement of the libron modes is generally less satisfying and just slightly in favor of the c2/c structure @xcite .",

    "however , at variance to others , no temperature induced phase transition has been observed for any of the considered phases @xcite .      from table  [ tab : bandgap ] it can be deduced that anharmonic finite temperature effects reduces the electronic band gaps of the c2/c and p6@xmath0/m phases by 0.63  ev and 2.13  ev , respectively . on the contrary ,",
