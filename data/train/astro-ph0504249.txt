    "the standard inflationary mechanism of the generation of cosmological perturbations assumes lorentz - invariance . this assumption is worth questioning  @xcite especially in view of the fact that relevant perturbations initially have wavelengths much shorter than the planck length ( this observation is often referred to as `` trans - planckian problem '' ) .",
    "furthermore , there is no guarantee that lorentz - invariance holds even towards the end of inflation .",
    "thus , it is certainly of interest to understand the effects that lorentz - violation may have on the cosmological perturbations .",
    "several ways to address this issue have been proposed .",
    "one is to assume lorentz - violating dispersion relation at short enough wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "if at asymptotically high momenta the frequencies exceed the inflationary hubble parameter , the adiabatic vacuum is a natural choice of the initial state , and then the primordial spectrum is still flat for pure de  sitter inflation  @xcite , while the predictions for the tilt may be different , as compared to the standard mechanism , if the expansion is not exactly de  sitter .",
    "the opposite case of low frequencies at high momenta  @xcite is hard to treat : perturbations are not initially in the adiabatic regime , so there is no preferred initial state ( an exception here is the bouncing universe model of reference  @xcite ) .",
    "another approach is to make ad hoc assumptions on the initial state of perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the problem with this approach is that any choice other than the adiabatic vacuum is hard to justify , whereas different choices lead to quite different spectra of perturbations  @xcite .",
    "one more possibility has to do with `` mode generation '' : there are models where the number of modes increases in time , as the universe expands  @xcite ; this happens , e.g. , if the physical momentum is effectively bounded from above .",
    "this option is in a sense similar to the previous one : the result for the spectrum of perturbations strongly depends on the choice of a state in which a newborn mode emerges .",
    "if this is the adiabatic vacuum , the outcome is similar to the standard scenario , at least for pure de  sitter inflation  @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture is that in the least exotic scenarios , the spectrum of perturbations is flat for pure de  sitter inflation , while predictions for the tilt in non - de  sitter cases are generally different from those of the standard mechanism .",
    "if the energy scale @xmath0 associated with lorentz - violation is much higher than the hubble parameter @xmath2 at inflation , the deviations of the spectrum from the predictions of the standard mechanism are suppressed by powers of @xmath4 , as argued on general grounds , e.g. , in references  @xcite . on the other hand , dramatic assumptions , like , e.g. , the corley ",
    "jacobson dispersion relation  @xcite with frequencies tending to zero at high momenta , lead to dramatic consequences : the spectrum may be quite different from the flat spectrum even for pure de  sitter inflation  @xcite .",
    "also , for @xmath5 the properties of the primordial perturbations may deviate substantially from the standard predictions even in some less exotic models , like , e.g. , the model of reference  @xcite based on noncommutative field theory .",
    "violation of four - dimensional lorentz - invariance is fairly natural in brane - world models  @xcite .",
    "it may occur in the bulk , especially if there is bulk matter ( a particularly well - understood solution of this sort is a brane moving in schwarzschild  anti - de  sitter bulk  @xcite ) or lorentz - violating bulk condensate  @xcite .",
    "since the wave functions of brane matter may extend to the bulk , the dispersion relations on the brane are then naturally lorentz - violating  @xcite . furthermore , some brane - world geometries have the property of `` mode generation '' in the following sense : for low three - momenta , there exist modes localized ( or quasi - localized ) on the brane , while for high three - momenta , localized and even quasi - localized modes are absent  @xcite .",
    "thus , as the universe expands and three - momenta get redshifted , more and more brane modes emerge ; this may be viewed as the brane - world version of mode generation . yet",
    "the initial state is well defined , provided that modes with high three - momenta are adiabatic in the bulk .    in this paper",
    "we consider an inflating version of the setup of reference  @xcite , and study massless scalar field , meant to mimic perturbations of the inflaton and/or gravitational field , in this background .",
    "this is nothing more than a toy model , as we specify neither the mechanism giving rise to lorentz - violation , nor the mechanism driving inflation .",
    "in fact , our background may be totally unrealistic , as it may require matter with unphysical properties either in the bulk or on the brane , or both . also , since we do not have a mechanism generating our background , we can not quantitatively address the issue of back reaction  @xcite of the perturbations on background geometry ( however , we will argue on qualitative grounds that this back reaction is small ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of our approach is that the properties of the massless scalar field are well understood in spite of mode generation on the brane and other unusual features .    to a certain extent",
    "we confirm the picture emerging from the previous studies . in the simplest version of our setup , with time - independent bulk parameters ,",
    "the spectrum of perturbations generated due to inflation is flat for pure de  sitter expansion , while its amplitude and , in the case of non - de  sitter expansion , the tilt are generally different from those predicted by the standard mechanism .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath6 , where @xmath0 and @xmath2 are still the scales associated with lorentz - violation and expansion rate at inflation , respectively , even the latter deviations are small .",
    "things are more interesting if one makes a relatively mild assumption that the bulk parameters depend on time , so that @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath2 towards the end of inflation . as an example , we consider the case in which @xmath0 slowly decreases in time , from @xmath1 at the early stage of inflation to @xmath7 towards its end .",
    "then the primordial spectrum is flat at low momenta , gets strongly tilted at intermediate momenta , and flattens out again at high momenta , as sketched in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the position of the tilted part , as well as its width , depend on the parameters of the model ; this part may well extend over several ( but not necessarily many ) decimal places , and the amplitudes at low and high momenta may differ also by several orders of magnitude . to avoid confusion , the primordial spectrum is cut off in the ultraviolet in the usual way , the cutoff being at physical momenta of order @xmath2 at the end of inflation .",

    "a lesson we learn from our toy model is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", we confirm that it is quite unlikely that in a well defined setup with lorentz - violation well above the inflationary hubble scale ( @xmath13 in our notations ) , the standard predictions may be strongly modified . in our model ,",
    "physics at three - momenta above @xmath0 is entirely multi - dimensional , and yet for @xmath6 this has basically no effect on primordial perturbations . on the other hand ,",
    "if lorentz - violation is characterized by low energy scale @xmath14 , the spectrum of perturbations strongly depends on details of the cosmological evolution at inflation , and may well be grossly different from the standard approximately flat spectrum .",
    "the spectrum sketched in figure  [ figure1 ] is interesting .",
    "if our scalar field is interpreted as mimicking tensor perturbations , this spectrum corresponds to greater ( maybe much greater ) primordial amplitudes of gravity waves at shorter wavelengths after re - entering the horizon . ] .",
    "if so , a possible non - observation of the effects of tensor perturbations on cmb would not preclude the detection of primordial gravity waves at shorter wavelengths by techniques ranging from timing of pulsars to ground - based interferometers .",
    "moreover , since the latter techniques cover a wide range of wavelengths , one might be able , with luck , to uncover an interesting pattern of relic stochastic gravity waves in our universe .",
    "likewise , the spectrum shown in figure  [ figure2 ] would correspond to relatively high power at long wavelengths , possibly measurable through cmb , with deviations from flatness potentially detectable by experiments searching for gravity waves at shorter wavelengths .",

    "the third term in equation  ( [ 7 ] ) is negligible for superhorizon modes ( @xmath111 ) , and besides the bulk modes , there is a localized mode @xmath112 where @xmath113 obeys the usual equation for superhorizon modes in four dimensions , @xmath114 and has a growing component @xmath115 where @xmath116 is independent of time .",
    "this is the standard superhorizon mode .",
    "it is localized on the brane , the wave function in the transverse dimension being given by equation  ( [ eq / pg10/1:version4 ] ) . in terms of the original field @xmath117 , we have for the localized part @xmath118 our goal is to relate the constant @xmath116 in equation  ( [ 3.12 * ] ) to the creation and annihilation operators entering equation  ( [ 3.11 + ] ) .",
    "this analysis is different for @xmath6 and @xmath119 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that in the case @xmath6 , the evolution of the scalar field is adiabatic when the physical momentum @xmath120 becomes of order @xmath0 , since at that time the physical frequencies are high , @xmath121 and slowly varying , @xmath122 at the time when @xmath123 , a bound state with @xmath124 emerges in the spectrum of the operator ( [ 3.11 * ] ) , and then its frequency @xmath125 slowly decreases from @xmath126 at the time when @xmath123 to @xmath127 at later times when @xmath128 but still @xmath129 . in this time interval",
    "the evolution is still adiabatic .",
    "since there is a gap of order @xmath0 between positive- and negative - frequency parts of the spectrum , there is no mixing between the positive- and negative - frequency modes at the time when the bound state appears , so the bound state is initially in the adiabatic vacuum , up to corrections suppressed by @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , its further evolution proceeds in the same way as in the standard four - dimensional scenario ; at the horizon crossing , @xmath130 , the shape of the bound state is already given by equation  ( [ 3.12 + ] ) modulo @xmath4-corrections .",
    "it is important here that by the time of the horizon crossing , there is no cross talk between the bound state and bulk modes , since they are also separated by the gap of order @xmath0 ( in terms of physical frequencies ) .",
    "we conclude that for @xmath6 , the spectrum and amplitude of perturbations coincide with the standard predictions up to corrections suppressed by @xmath4 .",
    "in this case the physical momentum crosses @xmath2 at the same time as it crosses @xmath0 , or earlier .",
    "adiabaticity gets violated at the same time or before the bound state appears .",
    "this case is hard to treat in detail ( see , however , sections  [ sec : timedependent ] and  [ sec : example ] ) , but for pure de  sitter inflation , equation  ( [ 1.1 + ] ) , there is a simple scaling argument showing that the spectrum in the localized mode is flat .",
    "let us introduce a new time variable @xmath132 equation ( [ 7 ] ) written in terms of @xmath133 does not contain @xmath8 explicitly .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath134 where the factor @xmath135 comes from @xmath136 in equation  ( [ 3.11 + ] ) , and we recalled that @xmath137 as @xmath98 .",
    "thus , up to overall factor @xmath138 , the initial condition does not contain @xmath8 explicitly either .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ print7 * ] ) is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "so , the solution to equation  ( [ 7 ] ) has the general form @xmath139 where for given @xmath133 , the operator @xmath140 is a linear combination of @xmath104 with @xmath8-independent coefficients .",
    "therefore , towards the end of inflation , the localized part of the solution , for subhorizon three - momenta , behaves as follows ( see equation  ( [ 3.12 + ] ) ) , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is given by equation  ( [ eq / pg10/1:version4 ] ) and @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a time - independent linear combination of @xmath145 with @xmath8-independent coefficients .",
    "the latter property implies that @xmath144 describes a gaussian field obeying @xmath146 where @xmath147 is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "recalling the relation ( [ 1.2 * ] ) , we obtain that the localized modes @xmath148 towards the end of inflation make up a gaussian field with flat spectrum , @xmath149 it is clear that this relation holds only for momenta which are superhorizon by the end of inflation , higher momenta being suppressed in the usual way .",
    "therefore , if the overall amplitude of perturbations is much smaller than 1 , their back reaction on the background geometry is likely to be small .",
    "the latter remark applies also to more interesting cases studied in section  [ sec : timedependent ] .",
    "it is also clear that for @xmath119 , the constant in equation  ( [ 15 + ] ) depends on @xmath0 and @xmath2 in a non - trivial way ( see also sections  [ sec : timedependent ] and [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "the latter observation implies , in particular , that for non - de  sitter inflation , the expression for the tilt does not generaly coincide with that in the standard scenario .",

    "they increase as given by equation  ( [ growth ] ) from the time @xmath158 to @xmath173 ; these times are still determined by equations  ( [ 17 * ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) , with @xmath0 now being the value of @xmath195 in the past , where @xmath7 . at the time @xmath173 the bound state emerges , and then the amplitude of the bound state mode increases as @xmath201 .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ result ] ) applies now to the soft modes .    * hard modes",
    "* are those which never become tachyonic when staying in the bulk , which is the case for @xmath202 they start growing after forming the bound state , so their amplitudes are given by the four - dimensional expression ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "the overall spectrum is thus the reverse of figure  [ figure1 ] ; it is shown in figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "the remarks made in the end of section  [ decaying k ] apply to the case of increasing @xmath0 as well .",
    "in this section we consider an explicit setup outlined in the end of section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "the field @xmath43 obeys equation  ( [ 8 * ] ) with the boundary condition ( [ 8 + ] )",
    ". we will be interested in the case @xmath203 and , as in section  [ sec : timedependent ] , study the dependence of the amplitudes on @xmath197 , assuming @xmath204 . as mentioned in section  [",
    "sec : setup ] , in spite of the fact that variables separate in equation  ( [ 8 * ] ) , the dynamics is non - trivial due to the time - dependence of the boundary condition ( [ 8 + ] ) .",
    "we simplify the analysis further by making use of the instantaneous approximation to the boundary condition ( [ 8 + ] ) .",
    "namely , at @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is given by equation  ( [ beta ] ) , i.e. @xmath207 the third term in equation  ( [ 8 + ] ) dominates and we omit the first two terms .",
    "so , at these times the boundary condition reads @xmath208 on the other hand , at @xmath209 we neglect the third term in equation  ( [ 8 + ] ) and the boundary condition becomes @xmath210 in this approximation , the problem reduces to that of solving the field equation ( [ 8 * ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ eq / pg19/1:paper ] ) , ( [ eq / pg20/1:paper ] ) and matching the solutions at @xmath211 .    at @xmath205 the solution is ( we slightly change the notation as compared to equation  ( [ 3.11 + ] ) ) @xmath212\\ ] ] where @xmath213 are @xmath214 and @xmath215 as @xmath216 , these modes approach properly normalized negative - frequency plane waves @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 is a constant phase . for @xmath7 and small enough @xmath220",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is real .",
    "so , these modes indeed grow like @xmath221 in the interval @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is determined by equation  ( [ 17 * ] ) . for @xmath224 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is imaginary , so the modes ( [ eq / pg20/3:paper ] ) oscillate in @xmath198 for all @xmath205 .    at late times ,",
    "@xmath209 , besides the bulk modes , there are two localized modes obeying equations  ( [ 8 * ] ) and ( [ eq / pg20/1:paper ] ) , @xmath225 these are the standard four - dimensional modes ; recall that @xmath203 , so at @xmath209 these modes are superhorizon . at @xmath209 the field @xmath43 is a superposition @xmath226 the coefficients here are obtained by matching this solution to the solution ( [ eq / pg20/3:paper ] ) at @xmath211 .",
    "we are interested in the coefficient @xmath227 , which is the amplitude of the growing localized mode . to this end",
    "we notice that the bulk modes entering equation  ( [ eq / pg21/1a : paper ] ) are orthogonal to @xmath228 with the standard scalar product @xmath229 on the other hand , @xmath230 thus @xmath231 where @xmath43 is the solution ( [ eq / pg20/3:paper ] ) , and the scalar product is to be evaluated at @xmath211 .",
    "one obtains for arbitrary @xmath198 @xmath232 thus @xmath233 where we took into account equation ( [ eq / pg20/1a : paper ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to calculate the spectrum of perturbations in the localized mode , defined as @xmath234 we make use of the relation ( [ 1.2 * ] ) of the original field @xmath117 to the field @xmath43 and the standard commutation relations @xmath235=\\delta ^3(\\mathbf { p}-\\mathbf { p}')\\delta ( \\lambda -\\lambda ' ) \\ ] ] with the expression ( [ eq / pg21/4:paper ] ) for the coefficient @xmath227 we find @xmath236 for time - independent @xmath0 , the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq / pg21/7:paper ] ) is independent of @xmath8 , the spectrum is flat , while the amplitude depends on @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath197 in a non - trivial way .",
    "this is in accord with the general analysis given in section  [ timedependent ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 slowly varies in time , the spectrum is no longer flat .",
    "the important time interval is @xmath237 , in which bulk modes grow provided that @xmath7 , and do not grow for @xmath224 .",
    "let us consider the case of decreasing @xmath0 , figure  [ figure4 ]",
    ". for low three - momenta one has ( see equation  ( [ 4.16 * ] ) ) @xmath238 and @xmath239 defined in ( [ eq / pg20/4:paper ] ) is pure imaginary .",
    "so , the integrand in equation  ( [ eq / pg21/7:paper ] ) is independent of @xmath197 at small @xmath197 .",
    "the spectrum is flat , and the power is @xmath240 where the constant is of order 1 . in the opposite case of high three - momenta ,",
    "the times are ordered as @xmath241 .",
    "so , @xmath242 and @xmath243 is real at small enough @xmath220 . in this case",
    "@xmath244 substituting this expression into equation  ( [ eq / pg21/7:paper ] ) one finds that the integral is saturated at small transverse momenta , @xmath245 .",
    "therefore , we again obtain the flat spectrum but with the amplitude enhanced by the factor ( [ inc ] ) ( up to logarithm ) , in agreement with the discussion in section  [ decaying k ] .",
    "if @xmath0 increases in time as shown in figure  [ figure5 ] , @xmath239 is imaginary for high momenta ( @xmath246 ) and real for low momenta ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "the perturbations get enhanced by the factor @xmath248 at low momenta , and do not get enhanced at high momenta , so we obtain the spectrum shown in figure  [ figure2 ] .",

    "in this appendix we illustrate the properties of eigenmodes of equation ( [ m7 * * ] ) by considering a step - function `` potential '' @xmath249 where @xmath250 and @xmath10 .",
    "we take the warp factor @xmath251 in the form ( [ m7 + ] ) , so that another `` potential '' is constant , @xmath252 we consider equation ( [ m7 * * ] ) on half - line @xmath253 and impose the boundary condition ( [ print7 * ] ) , i.e. , @xmath254 we are interested in localized or quasilocalized modes whose general expression at @xmath255 is @xmath256 then @xmath257 while the boundary condition ( [ mbc ] ) reads @xmath258    let us begin with localized modes .",
    "they decay at @xmath259 , @xmath260 where we set the overall factor equal to one . from equations  ( [ m7 * * ] ) and ( [ mfreq ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath261 where @xmath262 . by matching @xmath263 and @xmath264 at @xmath265",
    "we find @xmath266 and the relation ( [ ma+ ] ) gives @xmath267 this equation , supplemented with equation ( [ ma++ ] ) , determines the eigenvalue @xmath268 for given three - momentum @xmath8 .    at @xmath269 equation ( [ m7 * * ] )",
    "has a zero mode @xmath270 with @xmath271 and @xmath272 . for @xmath273",
    "there exists a solution to equations ( [ ma++ ] ) and ( [ ma+++ ] ) describing a localized state close to the zero mode , @xmath274 up to rescaling of coordinates on the brane , this mode has relativistic dispersion relation",

    "let us now turn to quasilocalized modes .",
    "they still have the form ( [ ma * ] ) at @xmath255 , while at @xmath253 they oscillate @xmath277 so that @xmath278 the normalization condition appropriate for the modes in continuum is @xmath279 by matching @xmath263 and @xmath264 at @xmath265 we obtain @xmath280 so the normalization condition ( [ ma * * * ] ) and equation ( [ ma+ ] ) determine the coefficient @xmath281 , @xmath282^{-1 } \\label{mastar}\\ ] ] the defining property of a quasilocalized mode is that it is large at the brane position ( when normalized according to ( [ ma * * * ] ) ) , @xmath283 at @xmath284 this relation indeed holds for @xmath285 in that case the quasilocalized mode exists for arbitrarily high three - momenta @xmath8 ; furthermore , at @xmath91 and @xmath286 one has @xmath287 so the localization gets stronger at high momenta @xmath8 .    at @xmath288 the only way the relation ( [ ma * * * * ] ) may be satisfied is that @xmath8 is large , and the first term in the square bracket in ( [ mastar ] ) vanishes , which gives @xmath289 the latter equation , however , has positive solutions only for @xmath290 thus , a quasilocalized mode exists at high three - momenta @xmath8 provided that @xmath291 is large enough , otherwise there are no no quasilocalized modes at @xmath91 .",
