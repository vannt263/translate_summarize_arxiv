    "using flavor symmetries of strong interactions , decays of @xmath4 mesons into @xmath5 and @xmath6 final states play an important role to determine the angles of the unitarity triangle @xcite of the ckm matrix @xcite , in particular for the angle @xmath2 which is notoriously difficult to measure at @xmath4 factories ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review ) . an experimentally promising approach to determine @xmath2 with the help of the branching ratios for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and their charge - conjugates was proposed in @xcite . recently the cleo collaboration has reported a first measurement of these decays @xcite . since at present only results for the combined branching ratios @xmath9\\label{br - char}\\\\ \\mbox{br}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp k^\\pm)&\\equiv&\\frac{1}{2 } \\left[\\mbox{br}(b^0_d\\to\\pi^-k^+ ) + \\mbox{br}(\\overline{b^0_d}\\to\\pi^+k^-)\\right]\\label{br - neut}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are available , it is unfortunately not yet possible to fix @xmath2 using that approach .",
    "however , as we have pointed out in a recent paper @xcite , even the _ combined _ branching ratios ( [ br - char ] ) and ( [ br - neut ] ) allow to derive stringent constraints on @xmath2 .",
    "so far information about that angle could only be obtained in an indirect way by using experimental data on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12@xmath13 mixing and cp violation in the neutral @xmath14-meson system . following these lines and using present data",
    ", one typically finds in the sm framework ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath15    using on the other hand our approach @xcite , one gets an allowed range for @xmath2 that is complementary to ( [ gamma - normal ] ) and is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is related both to @xmath18 and to the amplitude ratio @xmath19 of the current - current and penguin operator contributions to @xmath20 .",
    "the consistent description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 within the standard model ( sm ) implies furthermore the allowed range @xmath21 and upper limits for the cp asymmetry arising in @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that commonly accepted means to estimate @xmath22 yield rather small values that are at the edge of compatibility with the present cleo results due to the lower bound in ( [ range - r ] ) .",
    "concerning the constraints ( [ gamma - bound1 ] ) on @xmath2 , an important difference arises between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in the former case ",
    "the central values of the present cleo results @xcite @xmath25 give @xmath26  the bound @xmath17 takes a maximal value @xmath27 independent of the amplitude ratio @xmath22 . to be specific , for @xmath28 we have @xmath29 .",
    "the ckm angle @xmath2 can even be constrained in a more restrictive way if one uses additional knowledge on @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath23 , if @xmath30 is found to be larger than 1 , such information on @xmath22 is required to constrain @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , once more data come in confirming @xmath23 , the sm can be put to a decisive test and our approach @xcite could give hints for `` new physics '' .",
    "therefore it is an interesting issue to analyze new physics effects in @xmath31 decays and in particular their implications for the bounds derived in @xcite . such considerations are the topic of the present paper . in section  [ param ]",
    "we parametrize contributions of physics beyond the sm to the modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 . using some specific scenarios of new physics",
    ", we investigate the corresponding modifications of the constraints arising from these decays in section  [ disc ] .",
    "the main results are summarized briefly in section  [ concl ] .",
    "before we turn to effects of new physics , let us recall the general structure of the sm transition amplitudes for @xmath0 and @xmath32 . using @xmath33 isospin symmetry of strong interactions to relate the hadronic matrix elements of the relevant four - quark operators , we may write these amplitudes as @xcite @xmath34 , \\label{ampl - neut}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the qcd and color - suppressed electroweak ( ew ) penguin amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath37 is the color - allowed @xmath38 current - current amplitude . estimates within the sm yield @xcite @xmath39 so that the ew penguin amplitudes in ( [ ampl - char ] ) and ( [ ampl - neut ] ) are expected to play a very minor role @xcite .",
    "consequently we will neglect these contributions in the following discussion as we have done in @xcite . in subsection  [ ewps ]",
    "we shall come back to this issue , assuming a large enhancement of the ew penguins .",
    "since we are considering only @xmath0 and @xmath32 decays , new physics can be incorporated very generally by modifying the two amplitudes ( [ ampl - char ] ) and ( [ ampl - neut ] ) . to this end",
    "we write in a completely general way @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the new physics contributions to @xmath43 and @xmath44 quark - level transitions , respectively .",
    "we are obviously not in a position to fix the two complex amplitudes from present data .",
    "this means that additional assumptions have to be made in order to reduce the number of unknown parameters . in principle",
    "one could refer now to commonly used models for physics beyond the sm to estimate the new physics contributions @xcite . here",
    "we shall simply use some generic assumptions related to the behaviour of the new physics under isospin .",
    "although these additional assumptions may appear ad hoc , we think that they are of at least comparable use as the model estimates performed before .",
    "our first assumption is that no direct cp violation shows up in the new physics contributions to the decays under consideration , i.e.@xmath45 and the overlined amplitudes correspond to the charge - conjugate processes . in that particular case",
    "the @xmath46 amplitudes can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a cp - conserving strong phase and @xmath49 a cp - violating weak phase so that we have @xmath50 and using ( [ pen - ampl ] ) , we get @xmath51\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the `` averages '' are defined by @xmath52 denote differences of cp - conserving strong phases , and the parameters @xmath53 measure the strengths of the new physics contributions relative to the qcd penguin amplitude .",
    "we do not expect the quantities @xmath54 to be small of the order @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the scale of new physics .",
    "while such a suppression is active for ckm allowed tree level processes , in our case @xmath57 is not unreasonable due to the loop suppression of the qcd penguins in the sm",
    ".    a striking effect of new physics in @xmath0 would be a large cp asymmetry @xmath58 within the sm only very small values of that asymmetry , at most of @xmath59 @xcite , can be accommodated , whereas interference between the qcd penguin and new physics contributions may lead to potentially large cp - violating effects in that decay which are described by @xmath60 and require that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 take values different from 0 or @xmath63 .",
    "one of the central ingredients of our approach @xcite to constrain @xmath2 is the quantity @xmath64 which is given within the sm , neglecting small phase - space and @xmath4 lifetime differences , by the ratio ( [ r - det ] ) .",
    "that is , however , not the case in the presence of new physics . in order to distinguish ( [ r - det ] ) from ( [ def - r ] ) , we refer to the former ratio in the following discussion as @xmath65 since it can be obtained directly from the combined branching ratios that have been specified in ( [ br - char ] ) and ( [ br - neut ] ) .",
    "another important quantity is the amplitude ratio ( [ def - r ] ) . in @xcite",
    "we were using the combined branching ratio for @xmath0 to fix the magnitude of the qcd penguin amplitude @xmath35 yielding @xmath66 in the presence of new physics , the right - hand side of that equation does not measure ( [ def - r ] ) .",
    "since that ratio will nevertheless play an important role for our considerations , we refer to ( [ def - rexp ] ) in the following as @xmath67 .",
    "strategies to fix @xmath68 are discussed in @xcite .    in order to derive constraints from the combined @xmath31 branching ratios ( [ br - char ] ) and",
    "( [ br - neut ] ) , the combination @xmath69 of @xmath30 and @xmath22 plays a central role as we have pointed out in @xcite . within the sm",
    ", this quantity is simply given by the product of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "taking into account possible contributions from new physics , we get @xmath72 where @xmath73 consequently new physics manifests itself in two ways : first the relevant value of @xmath30 is shifted from its measured value @xmath74 by @xmath75 , and second @xmath76 is no longer related in a simple way to @xmath71 , i.e.  to the weak cp - violating phase of the @xmath37 amplitude .",
    "let us note that our expressions are still very general since we have so far only used ( [ no - cp ] ) to simplify our analysis .",
    "in order to proceed further , we have to make additional assumptions to reduce the number of unknown parameters . to this end we will focus on some scenarios of new physics .",
    "a very transparent one is discussed in the following subsection .",
    "one of the basic assumptions in this subsection is that the new physics contributions are equal for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e.  couple equally to @xmath77- and @xmath78-quarks , so that we have @xmath79 implying @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , isospin is conserved in many new physics scenarios , such as models with enhanced chromomagnetic dipole operators @xcite .",
    "in addition we assume that the strong phase difference between the qcd penguin and the new physics contributions vanishes , i.e.  @xmath81 .",
    "consequently the cp asymmetry ( [ cp - asym1-new ] ) for @xmath7 is zero in that case as in the sm . combining all these assumptions we get @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 with @xmath85 therefore the experimentally determined angle @xmath86 is not equal to the weak phase @xmath2 of the @xmath37 amplitude , but is shifted by @xmath87 .",
    "there are several strategies for experimental determinations of @xmath2 on the market @xcite . within the sm",
    ", these methods would all yield the same value of @xmath2 .",
    "once new physics shows up , differences may appear between these results since one type of strategies refers to charged @xmath4 decays originating from @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) transitions that receive only current - current and no penguin contributions  @xcite , while another type uses @xmath90 mixing @xcite . since new physics",
    "is expected to affect these mixing processes significantly  in particular the corresponding mixing phase  as they are suppressed fcnc loop processes @xcite , the latter methods are sensitive to physics beyond the sm similarly as our penguin dominated @xmath31 modes . in the case of the former strategies , only small effects of new physics are expected since they are using essentially pure `` tree '' decays and no fcnc processes .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : iso ] we show the dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath91 for various values of @xmath92 . since ( [ c - iso ] ) and ( [ cpasym ] ) have exactly the same form as the corresponding sm expressions , the formalism developed in @xcite can be applied by making only the simple replacements @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath76 is still constrained between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the bounds on @xmath67 given in @xcite still remain valid . consequently , whereas the overlap between ( [ gamma - normal ] ) and ( [ gamma - bound1 ] ) can be increased , the possible problem related to the constraints on @xmath67 that we have pointed out in @xcite , namely that any reasonable estimate of this amplitude ratio is only marginally compatible with the present cleo measurements , can not be solved using this simple scenario .",
    "= 8.5 cm      a scenario of new physics which potentially cures the problem with the value of @xmath67 is one in which the new physics contributions couple differently to @xmath77- and @xmath78-quarks and hence violate isospin as is e.g.  the case in models where a heavy boson is mediating additional @xmath98 fcnc contributions . in order to implement this in a managable `` toy '' model , we assume @xmath99 the vanishing of these phases is certainly a restrictive assumption .",
    "it is only meant to demonstrate that ( [ def - cnew ] ) and ( [ def - rnew ] ) incorporate a possible solution to the potential consistency problem with @xmath2 and @xmath67 . in the case of our specific @xmath33-violating scenario of new physics , these expressions simplify considerably to @xmath100 so that the bound @xmath17 is given by @xmath101.\\ ] ]    analogously to our recent paper @xcite , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : gamma0-new ] the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath67 for fixed @xmath102 corresponding to the central values of the recent cleo measurements and various values of @xmath103 .",
    "the new physics affects also the direct cp - violating asymmetry of the decay @xmath104 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : acp ] , where we plot the maximal value @xmath105\\ ] ] of that asymmetry on @xmath67 for @xmath106 and various values of @xmath103 .",
    "looking at these figures , we observe that one can indeed incorporate smaller values of @xmath67 and larger values of @xmath107 in our simple isospin - breaking toy model if @xmath108 is larger than @xmath109 .",
    "as far as the cp asymmetry is concerned , the curves for @xmath110 are shifted towards smaller @xmath67 compared to the sm case so that larger cp asymmetries can be accommodated .",
    "also the sm has , however , an interesting source of isospin breaking , namely ew penguins . since their contributions to the decays discussed in our paper",
    "are expected to be negligibly small within the sm , the corresponding amplitudes have been neglected so far . in the next paragraph",
    "we will discuss their impact on our analysis in slightly more detail by assuming a dramatic enhancement .",
    "= 8.5 cm      the ew penguin contributions can easily be incorporated into our formulae by using @xmath111 moreover we assume @xmath112 .",
    "the quantity @xmath113 has been introduced already in ( [ rho - ewp ] ) and measures the strength of the color - suppressed ew penguin contributions with respect to the qcd penguin amplitude .",
    "based on the estimates in @xcite one finds @xmath113 in the range of one to two percent .",
    "let us assume that non - perturbative effects in the hadronic matrix elements of the corresponding ew penguin operators or new physics effects give an enhancement of @xmath113 by a factor of @xmath114 with respect to our simple estimates .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma0-ew ] , where we have again used the central values of the cleo measurements to fix @xmath65 . from this figure",
    "we conclude that the sm contribution of the ew penguins is indeed negligible , and that a qcd enhancement tends to shift the bound @xmath17 towards higher values of @xmath67",
    ". hence it will probably not be able to cure the potential problem with the amplitude ratio @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , an artificially enhanced ew penguin contribution will lower @xmath17 leaving thus less overlap with the conventional bounds ( [ gamma - normal ] ) . for these considerations",
    "we have assumed that the strong interaction effects enhancing the ew penguins will not drastically change the cp - conserving strong phases of the ew penguin amplitudes .",
    "this assumption is questionable and for a large phase shift , as e.g.   @xmath115 , the situation could as well reverse .",
    "it is generally accepted that penguin dominated decays of @xmath4 mesons may be sensitive to new physics effects at a level which makes them interesting probes for non - sm effects . while this type of decays clearly will not be able to discriminate between different high energy scenarios , it still may turn out to be the first hint on physics beyond the sm . in @xcite we have pointed out that already combined branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays may lead to potential problems for the sm if the cleo measurements should stabilize at their present central values .",
    "firstly , the amplitude ratio @xmath67 of the current - current and the qcd penguin amplitudes is at the edge of compatibility with the sm , secondly the allowed range for @xmath2 obtained from the combined @xmath31 branching ratios has only a small overlap with the conventional determination of this angle , and thirdly a future measurement of the cp asymmetry in @xmath1 may lead to a surprise .",
    "the most general ansatz introducing new physics into these decays turns out to have too many parameters to be useful .",
    "hence some additional theoretical assumptions have to enter the game . a first restriction we have applied",
    "is to assume that the new physics contributions do not exhibit direct cp violation in the decays under consideration .",
    "we have given the expressions for the relevant observables in that particular case .",
    "they still involve six parameters related to new physics so that a general analysis becomes too clumsy .    in order to proceed further ,",
    "we have discussed three cases which we consider interesting , but which are of course quite restrictive .",
    "the first example assumes that the new physics contributions to the decays at hand are symmetric under @xmath33 isospin . in that case",
    "the experimentally determined value @xmath86 of @xmath2 is simply shifted by some angle @xmath87 depending on the new physics .",
    "interestingly , while this scenario offers a solution of the potential problem with @xmath2 , it can not solve the one related to @xmath67 .",
    "the second example was taylored to tackle that problem . here",
    "we assume that new physics breaks isospin . making certain assumptions concerning strong and weak phases of the new physics",
    ", we have shown that appropriate isospin - breaking could indeed cure the potential problem with @xmath67 as well as the one with @xmath2 .",
    "finally we reconsider the isospin - breaking due to ew penguin operators which are already present in the sm .",
    "estimates suffering from large hadronic uncertainties indicate that ew penguins should play a negligible role in the decays under consideration within the sm .",
    "an interesting observation is that the ew penguin contributions tend to shift the results such that the potential problems with consistency of the sm become worse .",
    "even if for some reason the ew penguins become dramatically enhanced , they will not cure these potential problems unless rescattering effects yield large cp - conserving strong phase shifts as e.g.   @xmath116 .",
    "although the hadronic uncertainties in @xmath31 modes , which are exclusive nonleptonic @xmath4 decays , are very large , these transitions may play an important role concerning the search for new physics . at first sight",
    ", this statement seems to be contradictory .",
    "however , the sm predicts the general phase structure of the corresponding decay amplitudes on solid ground",
    ". moreover isospin symmetry of strong interactions ",
    "working very well within the sm  allows to derive relations among these decay amplitudes .",
    "consequently , combining experimental data for @xmath31 in a clever way , the consistency of that description can be tested .",
    "since experimental data on these decays is now starting to become available , certainly an exciting time is ahead of us and a future reduction of the presently large experimental uncertainties may shed light on physics beyond the sm .",
