    "superconductors without inversion symmetry , the so - called non - centrosymmetric superconductors , have received much interest during recent years .",
    "the lack of an inversion center in the crystal lattice induces antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling , leading to important modifications of the superconducting phase .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling displays the rashba form in systems such as cept@xmath2si @xcite where mirror symmetry about a single plane is missing @xcite .",
    "due to such an antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling , the fermi surface is split into two sheets by the spin - degeneracy lifting and the electronic spin structure on the fermi surfaces is modified @xcite . the specific spin structure on the fermi surfaces due to the rashba coupling plays also an important role in connection with the josephson effect , as we will show here .",
    "the tunneling conductance between a normal metal and a non - centrosymmetric superconductor @xcite and the josephson effect between two non - centrosymmetric superconductors @xcite have been investigated by various groups . here",
    "we aim at the properties of the josephson effect between a conventional superconductor and a non - centrosymmetric superconductor .    the josephson effect between a conventional ( @xmath0-wave spin - singlet ) and an unconventional superconductor provides a possible way to probe the spin structure of the unconventional cooper pairing state @xcite .",
    "for the non - centrosymmetric superconductor cept@xmath2si , an experiment in this direction was recently performed by sumiyama _",
    "_ @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "al / cept@xmath2si junctions were prepared and their josephson effect was investigated by applying weak magnetic fields in order to observe the interference patterns in the supercurrent .",
    "a fraunhofer - shaped pattern was observed for the tunnel junction normal to the in - plane axis of the tetragonal crystal of cept@xmath2si , while a very irregular pattern appeared for the @xmath3 axis tunneling @xcite . a possible explanation of these findings was recently given by leridon _",
    "@xcite proposing cooper pairing violating time - reversal symmetry .",
    "here we introduce an alternative proposal which is based on the influence of rashba spin - orbit coupling on the josephson effect .",
    "first , we derive an expression for the dc - josephson current between a conventional superconductor and a non - centrosymmetric superconductor with rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "then we analyze the specific differences between differently oriented josephson junctions , in order to give an explanation for the observation in the al / cept@xmath2si junctions .    before",
    "going into details , we outline the basic idea .",
    "the josephson current @xmath4 is expressed as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the phase difference between the two superconductors .",
    "we suppose that we can decompose @xmath7 into two parts @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "then we assume that , for an inhomogeneous interface , the relative magnitude of the two contributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 varies , such that regions with @xmath13 and @xmath14 exist , i.e. , regions with @xmath15- and @xmath16-phase shifts @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 $ ] , respectively . for such junctions ,",
    "the interference pattern would deviate strongly from the ordinary fraunhofer pattern and , in particular , the central peak in the interference pattern may be missing , as observed in other systems with random @xmath15- and @xmath20-junctions @xcite . in this picture , the presence of a sufficiently strong @xmath21-component giving rise to a @xmath20 junction disturbs the fraunhofer pattern .",
    "as shown later , it follows that @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a vector normal on the interface",
    ". this effect would explain the experimental results @xcite that the fraunhofer pattern is absent ( present ) for the josephson junction perpendicular to the @xmath3 axis ( the @xmath27 axis ) . in the following sections",
    ", we will derive an expression for the josephson current composed of @xmath28 and @xmath21 parts .",
    "we consider a josephson junction between two superconductors , assuming spherical fermi surfaces for both superconductors , for simplicity .",
    "the fermi velocities can be written as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unit vector parallel to the fermi momentum .",
    "( we use units with @xmath31 and @xmath32 . )",
    "the superconductors on the left- and right - hand - side of the interface are labeled by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . according to millis _",
    "@xcite , the supercurrent @xmath4 flowing across the interface is given by @xmath35 with @xmath36 \\bigr\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the interface lies perpendicular to the unit vector @xmath26 located at @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the coordinate perpendicular to the interface .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 is the density of states on the fermi surface in the left - hand - side superconductor , and @xmath40 is the matsubara frequency with @xmath41 as the temperature .",
    "the commutator @xmath42={\\check a}{\\check b}-{\\check b}{\\check a}$ ] is defined in the usual way .",
    "the quasiclassical green function @xmath43 is a @xmath44 matrix composed of blocks in @xmath45 particle - hole space and in @xmath45 spin space .",
    "it can be written in the particle - hole space as @xmath46 the symbol tr in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) denotes the trace of the @xmath44 matrix . the matrix @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 as the unit matrix in the spin space .",
    "the interface is characterized by the tunneling @xmath50 matrix @xmath51 as @xcite @xmath52 the quasiparticle momentum parallel to the interface , @xmath53 , is conserved in the tunneling process , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "we may parametrize the @xmath50 matrices in the spin space as @xcite @xmath55 here we use the pauli matrices @xmath56 for the spin space , and @xmath0 and @xmath57 denote the spin - inactive and spin - active tunneling components through the interface , respectively .    for an interface potential which is invariant under time - reversal reflections in a plane perpendicular to the interface ,",
    "the tunneling amplitudes satisfy the relations @xcite @xmath58 the @xmath50 matrix at an interface between a conventional metal and a metal with rashba spin - orbit coupling can be calculated by applying the continuity condition for the wave function at the interface . within this scheme , we verified the above relations in the limit that the difference between the volumes of the split fermi surfaces is negligibly small , nevertheless taking account of the modified spin structure due to rashba spin - orbit coupling properly @xcite .",
    "this limit allows us to perform a simple and transparent analysis of the problem keeping the essential aspects .",
    "actually the general expression for the @xmath50 matrix is rather complicated and will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the josephson effect between a spin - singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor ( left - hand side ) and a non - centrosymmetric one ( right - hand side ) with rashba spin - orbit coupling @xmath59 , where @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the qualitative properties of such a junction can be obtained utilizing bulk green functions as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the spin - singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor with @xmath61 as the order parameter ,",
    "the green functions are given as @xcite @xmath62 on the non - centrosymmetric superconductor side , they have the form @xmath17@xmath63 , @xmath64@xmath19 $ ] @xcite : @xmath65 we use the notation , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the superconducting order parameters @xmath75 are defined on the split fermi surfaces i and ii , and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) stands for the singlet ( triplet ) order - parameter component in the non - centrosymmetric superconductor .",
    "it is important that the relative phase between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is 0 or @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath78 denotes the angle relative to the @xmath79 axis with @xmath80 .",
    "the above green functions can be inserted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) for @xmath81 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) and ( [ eq : m ] ) , we finally arrive at the following result , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the split fermi surfaces ( i and ii ) are taken into account also by the parameter @xmath85 which denotes the difference of the density of states .",
    "@xmath17@xmath86 , @xmath87@xmath19 $ ]  @xcite . the interface is described by means of the parameters , the scalar @xmath88 and the vector @xmath89 , given by @xmath90 @xmath91    within this scheme , we find that the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) are similar to the josephson coupling between spin - singlet superconductors (  singlet - like \" coupling ) , while the third and fourth terms resemble the coupling between spin - singlet and spin - triplet superconductors (  triplet - like \" coupling ) @xcite .",
    "this decomposition is independent of the explicit mixing of singlet - triplet pairing in the non - centrosymmetric superconductor , because eq .  ( [ eq : k2 ] ) has the same form even in the  pure singlet \" ( @xmath92 ) and  pure triplet \" ( @xmath93 ) pairing cases .",
    "the origin of the factor @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) is _ not _ the triplet pairing , but is the characteristic spin structure on the fermi surfaces due to rashba spin - orbit coupling @xmath59 .",
    "the josephson current is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) over the fermi surface ( @xmath95 ) . in the first and second terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) ( singlet - like coupling ) , @xmath88 is always positive according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : w0 ] ) , and therefore these terms correspond to @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "note that @xmath88 is real [ eq .  ( [ eq : w0 ] ) ] and the factor @xmath98 in eq .  ( [ eq : k2 ] ) leads to @xmath99 . on the other hand , the third and fourth terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) ( triplet - like coupling ) can be negative because of the coefficient @xmath100 of the spin - active tunneling @xmath17eq .",
    "( [ eq : m])@xmath19 $ ] , the sign of which depends on an interface potential formed at the junction between two different materials @xcite .",
    "the actual interface potential formed between al and cept@xmath2si is unknown .",
    "however , we assume here that the interface potential gives rise to a negative sign for @xmath100 . under this assumption , the third and fourth terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) can correspond to @xmath101 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "note that from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wvec ] ) it follows that @xmath102 is real , and the factor @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) leads to @xmath104 .",
    "now , we will demonstrate that @xmath21 , namely the integration of the third and fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) , becomes zero for a certain direction of the interface .",
    "the interface ( @xmath25 ) normal to the @xmath105 axis ( @xmath27 axis ) yields @xmath106 , where we use spherical coordinates according to @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "hence we obtain the factor @xmath109 , which is an _ odd _",
    "function with respect to @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "all other factors , @xmath112 and @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) , keep their sign with respect to @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) . from these ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath115 for @xmath25 , because of the factor @xmath116 originating from @xmath117 , where the integral range for @xmath113 is @xmath114 .",
    "in contrast , for the interface ( @xmath23 ) normal to the @xmath118 axis ( @xmath3 axis ) , @xmath119 , and we get @xmath120 . this factor remains _ positive _ over the integral range @xmath121 .",
    "the other factors such as @xmath112 and @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2 ] ) show no sign change in the whole range of @xmath113 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "thus we find @xmath122 for @xmath23 , because the integrand does not change its sign over the integral range .",
    "consequently , the results @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , have been obtained .",
    "they explain the experimental results for the al / cept@xmath2si junctions @xcite as discussed in introduction . from a symmetry point of view",
    ", our discussion would not be changed qualitatively for the case of anisotropic fermi surfaces .",
    "symmetries such as the mirror symmetry about the @xmath123 plane remain valid , even under the influence of antisymmetric ( rashba ) spin - orbit coupling @xcite . for this reason , the above argumentation on the signs of the integrands must hold even for anisotropic fermi surfaces .",
    "we investigated the behavior of a josephson junction between a singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor and a non - centrosymmetric superconductor with rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the expression for the josephson current - phase relation was derived for such a junction .",
    "this allowed us to give a possible explanation for the recent experimental results @xcite for the al / cept@xmath2si junction .",
    "furthermore , we anticipate that in the absence of an external magnetic field , spontaneous magnetic fluxes could appear along the interface normal to the @xmath3 axis of cept@xmath2si owing to random @xmath20- and 0-junctions , which can be observed experimentally , in principle , by scanning squid microscopes as in the case presented in ref .",
    "moreover , andreev bound states can be formed at surfaces of certain orientations in non - centrosymmetric superconductors @xcite .",
    "the influences of such bound states have been neglected here for the qualitative discussions as in refs .",
    "@xcite . a more detailed analysis taking these aspects into account",
    "is left for future studies .",
