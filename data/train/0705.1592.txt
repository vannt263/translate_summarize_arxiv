    "the success of the hipparcos astrometric satellite in obtaining a large number of absolute stellar parallaxes with much greater accuracy than had previously been possible ( esa 1997 ) , allowed a first estimate to be made of the zero - point of a cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation directly from cepheid parallaxes ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) .",
    "investigations of the hipparcos data continued after the publication of the catalogue , and led to the identification of a number of repairable problems associated with the reconstruction of the satellite s attitude ( van leeuwen 2005 ) .",
    "this ultimately led to a completely new reduction of the astrometric data ( van leeuwen & fantino 2005 ) , the results of which are soon to be published ( van leeuwen 2007 ) and have been incorporated in the current study .",
    "the main impact of the reductions is for the brightest stars , where improvements of up to a factor of four in parallax accuracy can be reached . for many of the cepheids improvements by up to a factor of two",
    "have been achieved .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss and analyse the revised hipparcos parallaxes of ( classical ) cepheids .",
    "recently , the parallaxes of 10 cepheids , measured with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and corrected to an absolute reference frame using ground - based observations , have been published and discussed ( benedict et al .",
    "2002 , benedict et al .",
    "2007 henceforth fb2007 ) and we have incorporated these data in our analysis .    since the discussion of the original hipparcos data there has been much work on cepheid photometry , period - luminosity ( pl ) relations , metallicity effects etc .",
    "and we have been able to take advantage of this in the present work .",
    "there has also been a great deal of theoretical work on cepheids .",
    "we do not discuss this since our aim has been to obtain empirically - based conclusions .",
    "we establish a reddening - free pl relation in @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( pl(@xmath15 ) ) as well as pl and period - luminosity - colour ( plc ) relations in @xmath16 and @xmath9 .",
    "these relations should be of use in a variety of contexts both galactic and extragalactic and for testing theoretical models . in the present paper",
    "we confine ourselves to the implication of our results for cepheid - based distances of galaxies including the lmc and the estimation of the hubble constant .",
    "the basic data used here are tabulated in the appendix together with notes on individual stars .",

    "+ initial tests showed that with the hipparcos parallaxes and listed photometry , the following stars lay 5@xmath38 or more from any reasonable pl relation : y sgr , v350 sgr , gq ori , sy nor , hl pup .",
    "the hipparcos data for all of these stars were omitted from the analysis , although only y sgr would have sufficient weight to make a significant contribution to the solutions discussed . in some cases",
    "erroneous classification may be the cause of the discrepancy .",
    "the reason for the significant discrepancy in the case of y sgr is not fully understood since the star has an hst parallax ( fb2007 ) in good accord with other cepheid data . in the combined solutions discussed below",
    "we use only the hst parallax for y sgr .    leaving aside y",
    "sgr there are nine cepheids in common with the hst parallax work .",

    "polaris , at its observed ( overtone ) period with @xmath45 ( the value from section 9 converted to the 2mass system using carpenter ( 2001 ) ) and equation 11 , gives @xmath46 ( taking into account the uncertainty in groenewegen s result .",
    "a straight mean of these two values ( @xmath8 ) is our best estimated of the pl(@xmath9 ) modulus of the lmc uncorrected for abundance effects .",
    "this is in agreement with @xmath47 derived by fb2007 .",
    "a weighted mean of the last three entries in table 7 leads to @xmath48 .",
    "together with equation 10 and an estimate of its uncertainty leads to a infrared plc modulus of @xmath47 again without any metallicity correction .",
    "these values may be compared with those found from @xmath49 in section 7 which were @xmath50 uncorrected for metallicity effects and @xmath51 with a metallicity correction from macri et al .",

    "our revised cepheid @xmath0 calibration leads to a revision of the cepheid - based distances to the 10 galaxies on which s2006 base their snia calibration and hubble constant .",
