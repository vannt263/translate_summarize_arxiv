    "since there are only a small number of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with observed redshifts at the present time , the derivation of their luminosity function has presented a difficult problem .",
    "a well established grb luminosity function would allow predictions of the distributions of flux and of redshift for planned grb surveys .",
    "the space densities and luminosities of grbs would be useful in discussing their relation to other objects and in understanding the physics of these fascinating objects .",
    "usually , the luminosity function of extragalactic objects is derived from a set of samples of the objects with observed redshifts to well defined flux limits . within a given cosmological model ,",
    "such observations allow a derivation of the luminosity function , including its dependence on redshift .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) @xcite on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ has made possible the collection of large well defined grb samples , such as the batse catalog based on on - board triggers , and the bd2 sample @xcite based on batse discla data ( see sec .",
    "2 ) . redshifts are available for a relatively small number of grbs . at the present time",
    "no well defined sample of grbs can be formed in which all or a substantial fraction of the objects has an observed redshift . as a consequence various other methods have been used to derive the grb luminosity function .",
    "the observed @xmath9 relation in a survey carries information about the luminosity of the survey objects . for a given cosmological model ,",
    "the flux at which the @xmath9 relation starts to fall below the euclidean slope of @xmath10 allows derivation of the corresponding luminosity .",
    "generally , the analyses assumed that grbs were standard candles @xcite and derived the maximum redshift or the standard candle luminosity by fitting the observed @xmath9 distribution for a given cosmological model and an assumed grb density distribution .    a different method to derive the luminosity function makes use of a luminosity indicator , i.e. , an observable property that correlates with luminosity .",
    "several luminosity indicators have been proposed , such as the spectral lag derived from cross - correlation of two spectral channels @xcite , and the variability in the time profile @xcite .",
    "the correlations of these properties with luminosity have been discovered and calibrated from a relatively small number of grbs with redshifts , e.g. , the variability correlation is based on seven redshifts @xcite .",
    "we have previously explored a reverse approach , in which we made assumptions about the shape and extent of the luminosity function , and then used the euclidean @xmath0 value of the bd2 sample ( see sec .",
    "2 ) to derive the characteristic luminosity @xmath11 and the local grb space density , again for a given cosmological model and grb space distribution @xcite . varying the assumptions about the shape of the luminosity function allowed an evaluation of the sensitivity of @xmath11 and the space density to the various input parameters .",
    "the deviation of the euclidean @xmath0 of cosmological objects in a well defined sample from the value 0.5 reflects to first order the effect of using euclidean geometry in its derivation rather than an appropriate relativistic cosmological model",
    ". these effects increase with distance and therefore the euclidean @xmath0 is a distance indicator for the sample objects .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig1 ] , where we plot the maximum redshift of a sample of bursts versus the euclidean @xmath0 for standard candle grbs with a photon spectrum @xmath12 .",
    "the curves show the relation for two different scenarios for the comoving space distribution .",
    "clearly , the euclidean value of @xmath0 is a cosmological distance indicator that can be used to determine a distance scale for cosmological objects for which no redshifts are available .    in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate a correlation between the euclidean value of @xmath0 and the spectral hardness of grbs .",
    "we interpret this correlation in terms of a luminosity - hardness correlation but are initally unable to show the correlation explicitly .",
    "we use the @xmath0 - hardness correlation to derive the grb luminosity function , as well as predicted counts as a function of flux and redshift .",
    "finally , we show the results of a simulation producing the luminosity - hardness correlation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we present the observed correlation between spectral hardness and @xmath0 . the methodology used to derive the luminosity function",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions are shown in sec . 4 , together with predicted distributions of flux and redshift .",
    "we show the results of a simulation producing the luminosity - hardness correlation in sec .",
    "5 , followed by the discussion in sec .",
    "6 . throughout this paper",
    ", we will be using a flat cosmological model with @xmath13 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use a large homogeneous sample , the bd2 sample , derived from batse discla data consisting of the continuous data stream from the eight batse lad detectors in four energy channels on a timescale of 1024 ms @xcite .",
    "the sample was derived using a software trigger algorithm that interpolated the background between given times before and after the onset of the burst and required an excess of at least 5@xmath16 over background in at least two detectors in the energy range @xmath5 kev @xcite . the first version ( the bd1 sample )",
    "was described in @xcite . a revision discussed in sec .",
    "2 of @xcite produced the bd2 sample .",
    "the bd2 sample covers a period of 5.9 y from tjd @xmath17 .",
    "it contains 1391 grbs , of which 1013 are also listed in the batse catalog .",
    "the median photon flux limit of the bd2 sample over the energy range @xmath5 kev is 0.31 ph @xmath18 s@xmath4 .",
    "the average euclidean @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "the sample of 1391 grbs effectively represents 2.003 y of full sky coverage .    in studying the correlation of spectral hardness of grbs with other properties",
    ", we have to choose a relevant part of the light curve since the spectral hardness of grbs generally varies while the burst is going on .",
    "the euclidean values of @xmath19 in the bd2 sample have been derived from simulations in which the grb is moved out until the detection algorithm fails to trigger @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the final detection is on the peak of the grb time profile .",
    "therefore , we use the 1024 ms interval containing the peak flux to derive the hardness ratio hr32 as the ratio of the burst counts in batse channels 3 ( @xmath21 kev ) and 2 ( @xmath22 kev ) for the brightest illuminated detector . from hr32 , the illumination angle and the batse detector response matrix , we then derive the photon spectrum slope @xmath23 .    in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    ", we plot the euclidean value of @xmath19 versus @xmath23 for all 1391 grbs in the bd2 sample .",
    "we also show @xmath0 for 4 spectral classes of @xmath24 grbs each ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 values range from @xmath25 for the softest bursts to @xmath26 for the hard ones .",
    "the mean errors of the @xmath0 values are around @xmath27 .",
    "before we use this correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath28@xmath23 @xmath29 , we evaluate the effect of statistical errors in the counts used to derive @xmath23 .",
    "the detection of grbs in the bd2 sample was based on the sum of the counts in channels 2 and 3 , without regard to their ratio hr32 .",
    "the statistical error in hr32 , determined by the burst counts and the background counts in each of the two channels , will be larger for weaker grbs , which have larger values of @xmath19 .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig2 ] a strong concentration of @xmath23 around @xmath30 at low @xmath19 where errors are small . as we move upward in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    ", the statistical errors will scatter @xmath23 horizontally , causing the concentration at @xmath23 @xmath31 to widen .",
    "there will be a net movement of points to the left and to the right and this effect will increase toward the top of the diagram .",
    "this causes @xmath0 to be too large for @xmath23 values well below and above @xmath30 .",
    "we have carried out simulations to estimate the systematic effect on @xmath0 .",
    "we used actually measured background counts in channels 2 and 3 for each of the 1391 grbs and took the errors to be gaussian .",
    "we assumed that the actual distribution of @xmath23 is represented by the brightest quartile of 348 grbs , which are confined to @xmath19 @xmath32 at the very bottom of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we ensured that in the input sample there was no correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath23 by associating each @xmath19 with each @xmath23 , so that the input set of bright bursts consisted of @xmath33 objects .",
    "this hypothetical bright set was then used to simulate @xmath19 and @xmath23 values for the 1043 objects with @xmath19 @xmath34 .",
    "the results are exhibited in table  [ tbl-1 ] and figure  [ fig2 ] , where we show both observed values of @xmath28@xmath23 @xmath29 and @xmath0 , and values corrected for the systematic errors resulting from the simulations . for the softest and the hardest classes , the errors caused @xmath23 to move away from the center and @xmath0 to increase . for the classes in the middle ,",
    "@xmath0 decreased because high values of @xmath19 scattered away in @xmath23 .",
    "we are not showing mean errors for the corrected values of @xmath0",
    ". they will be at least @xmath27 but are likely dominated by systematic errors in the simulations or in the statistical behavior of the observed counts that we can not judge .",
    "given that the euclidean value of @xmath0 is a distance indicator ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the hard bursts in the sample on the average must be at larger distances and the softer bursts nearer . with the density distribution sf2 ( see sec .",
    "3 ) and the assumption of standard candles used for the illustration in figure  [ fig1 ] , one would estimate a maximum redshift of @xmath35 for the softest bursts and @xmath36 for the hardest bursts . with the given flux limit of the bd2 sample , the soft bursts are therefore of lower luminosity and the hard bursts of higher luminosity .",
    "we conclude that the spectral index @xmath23 is a luminosity indicator and that there exists a luminosity - hardness correlation .    at this stage",
    "we can not show the luminosity - hardness correlation explicitly due to the dearth of observed redshifts .",
    "once we have derived the grb luminosity function , we will produce an explicit luminosity - hardness correlation through simulation , see sec .",
    "could the correlation of @xmath0 on @xmath23 be a consequence of the shape of the spectrum of grbs ?",
    "the typical grb photon spectrum is often characterized as the band spectrum @xcite , with low energy slope @xmath37 , high energy slope @xmath38 and break energy near 150 kev . at low redshift",
    ", this spectrum will have an observed @xmath23 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , while at high redshift it will be @xmath40 . thus more distant bursts will have softer spectra , which is the opposite of our finding above .",
    "previous studies of the correlation between hardness and global grb properties have been based on the @xmath9 relation or on @xmath19 , often involving duration - hardness classes @xcite . among the three classes considered by @xcite , classes b and c contained grbs with @xmath41 s similar to the bd2 grbs detected at a time scale of 1024 ms .",
    "the hard bursts in class b had @xmath0 @xmath42 while the soft bursts in class c had @xmath0 @xmath43 , showing the same trend as seen in figure  [ fig2 ] . also of interest is the study by @xcite who defined nhe bursts as those that have a marked lack of high - energy flux ( @xmath44 kev ) , in contrast to he bursts that have a strong high - energy flux . using the @xmath9 relations for both types they concluded that he bursts are eight times more luminous than nhe bursts",
    "this agrees qualitatively with our finding that hard bursts are more luminous than soft bursts .",
    "we have not used the durations or the duration - hardness classification of grbs for the following reason . in the bd2 sample",
    "we define the duration of a grb as the total time elapsed between the time of trigger and the last time the burst flux exceeded the limiting flux for triggering . in our simulations",
    "in which we move a burst out in distance to derive its @xmath19 , we find that the duration decreases to around 1 or 2 seconds when last detected .",
    "clearly , our definition of duration does not produce an absolute property of the burst .",
    "therefore , we have not considered duration - hardness classes for the bd2 grbs .",
    "the batse @xmath45 and @xmath46 durations also suffer from a `` fluence - duration '' bias according to @xcite .",
    "if the derived duration of a given burst depends on its flux , then the @xmath19 values for bursts with a minimum observed duration have to be derived using two simultaneous limits @xcite , i.e. the flux limit and the duration limit .",
    "ignoring this requirement will give rise to systematic errors in @xmath19 .",
    "in the next section , we will find that the central luminosities of the 4 spectral classes ( see table 1 ) range over a factor of around @xmath47 .",
    "this makes it possible to construct the luminosity function of grbs .",
    "the derivation for each of the spectral classes is similar to that employed previously in @xcite for the entire luminosity function .",
    "we use the cosmological parameters @xmath13 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the grb luminosity function @xmath48 of the spectral class @xmath49 can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath49 refers to the four spectral classes ( see table 1 ) , @xmath51 is the peak luminosity in the given energy band , @xmath52 is the @xmath53 luminosity function of class @xmath49 , and @xmath54 the comoving grb density distribution normalized at @xmath53 .",
    "we assume that each @xmath52 has a gaussian distribution of @xmath55 with a dispersion @xmath56 around a central peak luminosity @xmath57 .",
    "the grb luminosity function @xmath58 is the sum of the spectral luminosity functions @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that the photon spectrum is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "the peak flux @xmath60 observed for a grb of luminosity @xmath51 at redshift @xmath61 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the bolometric luminosity distance for the cosmological model .",
    "the peak flux @xmath9 distribution for grbs of spectral class @xmath49 is , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is derived from equation ( 2 ) , @xmath66 is the comoving volume and the term @xmath67 represents the time dilation @xcite . with the known distribution of flux limits @xmath68 in the bd2 sample , we can derive the euclidean value of @xmath0 from the individual values @xmath19 @xmath69 .",
    "the central peak luminosity @xmath57 of each spectral class is iterated until @xmath0 agrees with the observed value .",
    "the limiting peak flux @xmath68 depends on the grb spectrum .",
    "based on the batse detector response matrix , log @xmath68 increases by @xmath70 from the softest to the hardest class .",
    "this does not affect the @xmath19 derivation described above since @xmath71 is equally affected .",
    "the luminosity @xmath57 derived for spectral class @xmath49 scales as @xmath68 .",
    "the comoving grb density distribution @xmath54 is often referred to as the star formation rate based on the expectation that grbs are caused by massive stars . @xcite",
    "have parametrized various models for the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) with redshift . in model sf1 ,",
    "based on @xcite , the sfr rises rapidly by an order of magnitude between @xmath53 and @xmath72 , peaks between @xmath72 and @xmath73 and declines gently at higher redshifts . in model sf2 , based on @xcite , it rises similarly but then remains roughly constant for @xmath74 .",
    "model sf3 , reflecting the possibility that extinction has been underestimated @xcite , has an sfr continuing to rise beyond @xmath73 . for the cosmological model used in this paper ( @xmath13 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ) , the star formation rates for @xmath75 are 9.5 , 7.7 , 3.4 ( sf1 ) , 8.3 , 12.8 , 12.7 ( sf2 ) , and 6.2 , 12.8 , 16.1 ( sf3 ) , respectively .",
    "we use these three models to characterize @xmath54 in the derivation of the luminosity function .",
    "as descibed in the preceding section , we derive the luminosity function at @xmath53 for each of the 4 spectral classes separately .",
    "we set the gaussian dispersion of each @xmath52 at @xmath76 .",
    "the central peak luminosities @xmath57 of the spectral classes were determined from the corrected values of @xmath28@xmath23 @xmath29 and @xmath0 given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions at @xmath53 for each of the four spectral classes for the sf2 model are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the sum of the spectral luminosity functions constitutes the overall luminosity function .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the resulting luminosity functions for density distributions sf1 , sf2 , and sf3 .",
    "the central peak luminosities @xmath77 range from @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the luminosity function generally appears to be a power law from @xmath81 erg s@xmath4 to @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , and then to decline more steeply .",
    "the total @xmath53 grb densities are 0.48 , 0.51 , and 0.72 gpc@xmath7 y@xmath4 for sf1 , sf2 , and sf3 , respectively .",
    "the luminosities and densities quoted are isotropic - equivalent values .",
    "if all grbs are beamed into , say , @xmath82 steradians , then luminosities require multiplication by @xmath83 and densities by @xmath84 .",
    "if the luminosity - hardness correlation represents the distribution of luminosities within a grb beam , the situation would be more complex and the corrections to luminosity and density would be a function of luminosity .    the cumulative distribution of peak fluxes observed in the bd2 sample is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the predicted @xmath9 distributions are in excellent to good agreement with the observations . compared to an annual all - sky rate of 694 grbs based on the bd2 sample , we expect above 0.1 ( 0.01 ) ph @xmath18 s@xmath4 annual rates of 2560 ( 5090 ) , 2720 ( 6810 ) , and 2830 ( 8460 ) for cases",
    "sf1 , sf2 , and sf3 , respectively .    in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    ", we show histograms of the expected redshift distribution in the bd2 sample .",
    "the fraction of high redshifts increases from sf1 to sf2 to sf3 : the expected fractions with @xmath85 are 1 , 5 , and 12% , respectively .",
    "the largest single redshift that may be expected in the bd2 sample of 1391 grbs on the basis of these three models is around 6 , 13 , or 19 , respectively .",
    "these , however , may be overestimates for sf2 and sf3 , since in these cases the star formation rate remains high at large redshift , with no provision for the onset of star formation .    in the derivation of the luminosity function , we assumed that the spectrum of the grbs in each spectral classes was a simple power law of slope @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite has compiled grb spectra as a function of a fluence hardness ratio , based on the four batse lad channels .",
    "most of the spectra appear to be broken power laws .",
    "the dependence on the hardness ratio seems to be a general change in slopes with little change in break energy .",
    "we have tested the effect of using these systematics by adopting instead of the simple power law a band spectrum @xcite with @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 kev . the resulting luminosity function and predicted distributions of flux and redshift were virtually identical to that from the simple power law with slope @xmath23 .",
    "now that we have derived the grb luminosity function , we are in a position to generate the luminosity - hardness correlation through a simulation . in order to reduce the effect of the counting errors on @xmath23 discussed in sec .",
    "2.1 , we use the @xmath23 values of the brightest quartile , consisting of 348 grbs with @xmath0 @xmath89 .",
    "we assigned each of these grbs a random luminosity from its spectral luminosity function @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting plot of peak luminosity versus @xmath23 is shown in figure  [ fig7 ] . for @xmath23 @xmath90 ,",
    "we see clear evidence of the luminosity - hardness correlation , with a slope @xmath91 .",
    "the dozen grbs with a large range of spectral indices below @xmath23 @xmath92 belong to the softest spectral class and therefore based on the present study can not show any correlation between luminosity and hardness .",
    "none of the grbs observed by batse with redshifts listed by @xcite belong to the softest quartile in the batse catalog .",
    "therefore , we can not at the present time check the main trend from soft to hard bursts in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the total range in luminosity of a factor of 50 in the @xcite list is compatible with the range shown by the hard grbs in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "this may indicate _ post facto _ that the adopted value of @xmath76 is a reasonable one .",
    "we have shown that there exists for grbs in the bd2 sample a @xmath93-hardness correlation , see figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "since the bd2 sample was selected from batse discla data on a timescale of 1024 ms , the correlation applies to grbs with durations larger than 1 s. based on the realization that the euclidean value of @xmath0 is a cosmological distance indicator , we concluded that there exists a luminosity - hardness correlation , but could only demonstrate it after we had derived the luminosity function .    with the @xmath93-hardness correlation we were able to derive the luminosity function without having to make assumptions about its overall shape , as had been required till now @xcite .",
    "we assumed a width for the luminosity function of each spectral class that was sufficient to produce a reasonably smooth overall luminosity function .",
    "the entire excercise of deriving the luminosity function was carried out without using any redshifts .",
    "we did have to make assumptions about the cosmological evolution or density distribution of grbs for which we chose various star formation rate models .",
    "this study has only been possible due to the power of the euclidean value of @xmath0 as an independent cosmological distance indicator .",
    "major progress beyond this work can be expected once systematic redshift surveys of grbs become available .",
    "the luminosity - hardness correlation should become directly observable . from samples with observed redshifts",
    "complete to given flux limits the grb luminosity function can be derived without having to make assumptions about the density distribution . and while the euclidean @xmath0 can not compete with the redshift as a distance indicator , the luminosity function should be compatible with the observed @xmath0 values of the samples .",

    "<S> based on the @xmath0-hardness correlation , we derive the luminosity function of grbs without using any redshifts , but we have to make an assumption how the comoving grb rate varies with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we present luminosity functions for three models of the grb rate as a function of redshift , based on star formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> the peak luminosity functions are approximately broken power laws with an isotropic - equivalent break luminosity of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 in the @xmath5 kev range and total local rate densities of @xmath6 gpc@xmath7 y@xmath4 . predicted grb counts as a function of flux and redshift are presented . </S>",
    "<S> based on the grb luminosity function , we carry out a simulation to produce the luminosity - hardness correlation , which shows that the hardest grbs are @xmath8 times more luminous than the softest ones . </S>"
