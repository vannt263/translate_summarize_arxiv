    "the fit residuals show several absorption features between 1.53  kev that contribute to the unacceptable fit .",
    "to illustrate better the presence of these absorption features and the absorption at energies below 1  kev , we fit the apm  08279 + 5255  data above the rest frame energy of 10.8  kev with a simple power - law model modified by galactic absorption and extrapolated this model to lower energies .",
    "the spectrum above 10.8  kev ( rest - frame ) is less susceptible to intrinsic absorption and excludes the absorption features .",
    "following this analysis strategy , the low - energy residuals indicate that intrinsic absorption is present in the spectrum .",
    "in addition , the spectrum shows two strong absorption lines from 1.53  kev ; these are presented in figure 2a .",
    "we attempt to model the residual features by considering a range of models of increasing complexity .",
    "we first add to our absorbed power - law model a redshifted gaussian component near the most obvious absorption feature appearing at an energy of @xmath0 1.65  kev ( observed frame ) .",
    "including one gaussian component in our model leads to a significant improvement in fit quality at the @xmath2  99.9% confidence level ( according to the @xmath3-test ) with @xmath28 = 146.9 for 106 dof .",
    "the best - fit energy of the absorption feature is @xmath29 = 8.05@xmath30  kev ( rest frame ) .",
    "this absorption feature is in a well - calibrated energy region , and the combined effective area of the _ chandra_mirrors and acis is known to vary smoothly near this energy .",
    "the absorption feature is not resolved by acis ; we place an upper limit on its width of 140  ev ( corresponding to a fwhm of @xmath31 12,300 km s@xmath12 ) at the 90% confidence level .",
    "we next add a second gaussian component near 1.9  kev to model the remaining residuals near this energy .",
    "this fit is significantly improved compared to the previous fit at the @xmath2 99.9% confidence level and yields @xmath28 = 106.7 for 103 dof ; the fit is now statistically acceptable .",
    "the best - fit value for the photon index is @xmath32 , consistent with the range of @xmath9 measured for large samples of radio - quiet quasars at lower redshifts ( e.g. , george et al . 2000 ; reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "the best - fit energy for the second absorption line is @xmath33 = 9.79@xmath34  kev with a width of @xmath35 = 0.41@xmath36  kev .",
    "the second absorption feature falls near the instrumental iridium edge produced by the _",
    "chandra _",
    "mirrors . to ascertain any systematic calibration uncertainties near the mirror edge we have fit the spectra of several test - sources with expected smooth power - law spectra near the 2  kev iridium edge .",
    "since @xmath28 residuals depend on the statistics , we filtered the test - source data in time to produce spectra with a total number of counts equal to that observed in the second observation of apm  08279 + 5255 . typical @xmath28 residuals for these test - sources near the mirror edge are less than @xmath0 1@xmath37 indicating that the observed 5@xmath37 residuals near 2  kev are real and not due to systematic errors in the calibration of the effective area of the _ chandra _  mirrors .",
    "we find a ratio of @xmath0 0.5 between data and model near the two absorption features for the second observation of apm  08279 + 5255 .",
    "this ratio is significantly less than the observed ratio of @xmath0 0.95 between data and model for our test - sources .",
    "the fit that includes two gaussian absorption - line components shows positive residuals near 8.4  kev and 11.2  kev ( rest frame ) .",
    "these residuals may at least partially be the result of the simplistic absorption - line models that we have adopted in the present analysis .",
    "uv bals usually show multiple absorption components with non - gaussian profiles , and such complex profiles may also be present in x - ray bals .",
    "to test further the robustness of our modeling we also attempted to fit the 1.53  kev residuals in figure 2a with a model that included an absorption edge . specifically , for a model consisting of a simple power law with galactic absorption , intrinsic absorption , and one absorption edge we find a best fit energy and optical depth of the edge of @xmath38 = 7.68@xmath39  kev and @xmath40 = 0.37@xmath41 , respectively .",
    "this model did not provide an acceptable fit with @xmath42 = 146 for 107 dof . in figure 2b",
    "we show that the fit of the apm  08279 + 5255  spectrum with a one - edge model produces significant residuals .",
    "the reason for these large residuals is that the absorption edge is too broad to fit the narrow absorption lines .",
    "the addition of a second absorption edge to the model did not result in a significant improvement of the fit .",
    "our analysis of the _ chandra _  spectrum of apm  08279 + 5255  shows strong evidence for the presence of absorption lines at rest - frame energies of 8.05@xmath43  kev and 9.79@xmath34  kev ( fit  3 of table 2 ) .",
    "of all the abundant elements , iron absorption lines would be the closest in energy to the observed features . in this sense ,",
    "our interpretation that the absorption lines are associated with fe  k absorption is the most conservative one possible ( e.g. , absorption lines from relativistic oxygen would require much larger blueshifts ) . at higher atomic numbers than iron ( corresponding to higher absorption - line energies ) , there are no abundant elements .",
    "observationally , fe  k absorption lines have been seen from other objects , such as the x - ray binaries grs  1915 + 105 ( kotani et al .",
    "2000 ) , circinus  x-1 ( brandt & schulz 2000 ) , and gx  13 + 1 ( ueda et al .",
    "2001 ) and possibly the agn ngc  3516 ( nandra et al .",
    "we note that the expected ratios of the energies of the iron k@xmath44 to k@xmath45 transitions of fe  xxv and fe  xxvi are just outside the 2@xmath37 confidence limits of the ratio of the energies of the two observed absorption lines .",
    "because of the possible presence of multiple components within each of the observed absorption lines , we expect that future x - ray observations of apm  08279 + 5255  with higher energy resolution will unambiguously show whether the observed absorption lines correspond to the k@xmath45 and k@xmath44 transitions of fe  xxv or fe  xxvi .    a plausible site that may be producing the absorption features is the outflowing disk wind .",

    "the wide range of ionization levels , velocities and column densities inferred from the uv bals of apm  08279 + 5255  imply that the wind may be composed of multiple regions of different densities , with large ionization gradients ( srianand & petitjean 2000 ) . for our estimate of the ejection velocities of the absorbers we assume as argued above that the x - ray absorption features are due to absorption from fe ions in the flow .",

    ", we have reported on the discovery of the first x - ray bals in the gravitationally lensed quasar apm  08279 + 5255 .",
    "the energies of the two observed absorption features of 8.05  kev and 9.79  kev ( rest frame ) suggest the presence of two distinct absorption systems with velocities of @xmath0 @xmath5 and @xmath0 @xmath6 , respectively .",

    "we expect future follow - up observations of apm  08279 + 5255with the _ chandra _  high - energy transmission grating and the _ xmm - newton _  rgs to identify the absorbing ions and resolve the x - ray absorption features into multiple components allowing for tighter constraints of the properties of x - ray bals .",
    "we also plausibly expect variability of the absorption - line profiles over short time - scales of @xmath0 days based on our estimates of the launching radii of the x - ray absorbers .    during the review of this paper ,",
    "a related paper was posted on the apjl web site by hasinger , schartel , & komossa ( 2002 ) .",
    "they report the detection of an ionized fe k edge in apm  08279 + 5255  with _ xmm - newton_. a visual comparison between the _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  spectra of apm  08279 + 5255suggests the presence of the two absorption features in both cases ; however , the equivalent widths of the absorption features appear to be reduced during the deep _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "the edge model adopted in the analysis of the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of apm  08279 + 5255  does not provide an acceptable fit to the _ chandra_spectrum of this object .",
