    "non - identity check , which is defined and proven to be quantum merlin - arthur ( qma ) complete in @xcite , is the problem of determining whether a given quantum circuit ( unitary ) is almost equivalent to a complex multiple of the identity with respect to the operator norm .",
    "qma is known to be a quantum analog of np because it is an extension of the verifier - based definition of np , in that sense non - identity check is one of the hardest problems based on quantum gate array complexity .    there is another quantum analog of np , non - deterministic quantum polynomial - time ( nqp)@xcite .",
    "nqp is defined as an extension of the machine - definition of np , which is a set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a non - deterministic turing machine . here",
    ", we have a question : is there any nqp - complete problem based on quantum gate array complexity ?    in this paper , to answer the question , we propose exact non - identity check which is the problem of determining whether a given classical description of a quantum circuit with an ancilla system is strictly equivalent to a complex multiple of the identity or not , and we prove that exact non - identity check is nqp - complete .",
    "it is important to derive a nqp - complete problem based on quantum gate array complexity for at least two reasons .",
    "one is that such problems are less well - known because nqp does not equal qma .",
    "while two definitions of np are equivalent , the following relation between qma and nqp is known to be satisfied@xcite ,    [ nqpqma ] @xmath0 } qma(\\delta , 0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where qma(@xmath1 ) is defined as qma with perfect soundness in preliminary .",
    "lemma [ nqpqma ] suggests that nqp does not equal qma .",
    "we use lemma [ nqpqma ] to prove the nqp - hardness of exact non - identity check .",
    "the other reason is that the nqp - complete problem is useful to analyze quantum gate array complexity .",
    "for example , we can show trivially that exact equivalence check is nqp - complete from exact non - identity check , where exact equivalence check is the problem of determining whether two unitary operations implemented by two given classical descriptions are strictly equivalent or not .",
    "further , it is derived to be hard to minimize quantum gate resources of a given quantum gate array without changing the content of the implemented unitary operation .    in this paper , first , we give our notations and definitions in preliminary .",
    "second , we propose exact non - identity check and exact equivalence check , and prove the nqp - completeness of exact non - identity check and exact equivalence check . further , quantum gates minimization problem is defined and proven to be nqp - hard . finally , we summarize the exact non - identity check .",
