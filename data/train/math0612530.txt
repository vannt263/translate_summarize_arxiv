    "the following construction of the graph - associahedron is based on truncations of a simplex .",
    "indeed , truncations should not only be in increasing order of dimension ( certain vertices of @xmath44 are truncated first , and then the edges , and so forth ) , but they should also not form `` deep cuts '' . consider figure  [ f : deepcuts ] as an example .",
    "part ( a ) shows a @xmath46-simplex with two vertices marked for truncation ; part ( b ) shows appropriate truncations of the vertices , with ( c ) and ( d ) showing inappropriate cuts which are too deep .      in order to recover loday s elegant construction of the classical permutohedron as part of the associahedron",
    ", we simply use the following recursive definition of @xmath24 : @xmath47 although this works for the associahedron , it fails for graph - associahedra in general .",

    "one can verify that the edges correspond to all possible @xmath36-tubings and the vertices to @xmath46-tubings .",

    "the faces of @xmath44 which need to truncated correspond to the @xmath45-tubings @xmath51 , where @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be a @xmath45-tubing in @xmath55 ; note that this corresponds to a @xmath56 face of @xmath44 , seen as the intersection of the hyperplane @xmath57 of @xmath33 with @xmath44 .",
    "truncate this face with the hyperplane @xmath58 we claim that this collection of hyperplanes , one for each element of @xmath51 , results in @xmath1 .    by theorem  [ t : pg ] above , the appropriate faces of @xmath44 have been truncated , one for each @xmath45-tubing .",
    "however , we need to show the any two cuts of a given dimension are not deep ; that is , their corresponding hyperplanes must not intersect in @xmath41 .",
    "this is done by induction .",
    "two vertices of @xmath44 which are truncated correspond to @xmath45-tubings in @xmath59 , say @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these hyperplanes can not intersect in @xmath41 since eqs .   and show @xmath62 in general , let @xmath63 be in @xmath64 , a @xmath12-dimensional face of @xmath44 that is truncated .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be two @xmath67-dimensional faces of @xmath44 in @xmath68 which are incident to @xmath63 .",
    "the cuts @xmath65 and @xmath66 will not be deep with respect to @xmath63 . to see this , notice that the nodes of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are contained in @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in @xmath41 the hyperplanes of @xmath65 and @xmath66 can not intersect in @xmath63 since @xmath69    recall that each vertex of @xmath1 corresponds to a @xmath23-tubing @xmath70 of @xmath0 .",
    "this , in turn , corresponds to the intersection of the @xmath19 hyperplanes of for each @xmath45-tubing of @xmath70 . in particular",
    ", a tube containing one node assigns the value @xmath71 to that node ; these are incident to the original facets of @xmath44 .",
