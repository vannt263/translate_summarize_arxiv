    "the relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at cern - sps and especially at the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic in brookhaven national lab provide clear evidence for the production of a dense matter in the collision processes @xcite .",
    "the central question is whether this matter is purely hadronic or has been going through a quark - parton phase .",
    "there exist experimental evidences in favor of the existence of a quark - parton phase at the early stage of collision processes @xcite , but in view of the importance of this question , further confirmation is needed .",
    "recently , the rapidity correlation between oppositely charged particles , which has been used in  @xcite and hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite to study the hadronization in these processes , is proposed  @xcite as a measure of the hadronization time in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is argued that if the system produced in heavy ion collisions has undergone a quark - parton phase , the hadronization will occur at a later time and , therefore , the temperature will be lower and the diffusive interaction with other particles will be lesser than those in the direct hadronization without going through a quark - parton phase .",
    "these will result in a narrower charge balance function for a system with quark - parton phase than that without such a phase .",
    "two heavy ion experiments  @xcite have measured the balance function at various centralities and for different colliding nuclei .",
    "a narrowing of the balance function is indeed observed with increasing centrality of the collision and with increasing size of the colliding nuclei .",
    "these observations are consistent with the assumption that the narrowing of balance function is correlated with late hadronization .    on the other hand ,",
    "recently it is reported  @xcite that in hadron - hadron collisions at @xmath0 gev the balance function also becomes narrower as the increasing of multiplicity .",
    "therefore , whether the observed narrowing of balance function in relativistic heavy ion collisions is due to late hadronization or is simply due to the multiplicity effect is an open question .    in this letter this question is examined using the monte carlo generators pythia @xcite and ampt @xcite .",
    "the former is a standard monte carlo generator with string fragmentation as hadronization scheme .",
    "there is not any quark - parton phase in this model and the hadronization is almost instantaneous . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter is a `` multi - phase '' model , with a transport of quark - parton before hadronization .",
    "the results from pythia will be presented in section ii .",
    "the hadronization time in ampt model is discussed in section iii , and its connection with the width of balance function is presented in section iv .",
    "section v is summary and discussion .",
    "the balance function is defined as  @xcite @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the numbers of pairs of opposite- and like - charged particles satisfying the criteria that they fall into the rapidity window @xmath6 and that their relative rapidity equals @xmath7 ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles , respectively , in the interval @xmath6 .    the balance function @xmath10 represents the probability that the balancing charges are separated by @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the mean of @xmath7  @xcite y_= is defined as the _ width of balance function_.    proton - proton collision events are generated at four c.m .",
    "energies  22 , 64 , 130 and 200 gev using pythia5.720 generator .",
    "the event number for each sample is 100,000 .",
    "the widths @xmath12 of balance function in the full phase space are calculated for different ( charged ) multiplicity bins and plotted in fig .  1 .     the width of full - phase - space balance function for different multiplicities in p - p collisions at @xmath13  gev.,width=240 ]",
    "it can be seen from the figure that in this model even for p - p collision , where no quark - parton phase is expected and the hadronization is almost instantaneous , the width of balance function decreases with the increase of multiplicity ,  the width of balance function is narrower for higher multiplicity .",
    "this effect has nothing to do with hadronization time .    on the other hand , by definition balance function",
    "measures the correlation length between oppositely charged particles .",
    "for comparison we have calculated the standard 2-particle correlation function  @xcite of oppositely charged particles & & -12 mm r^+-(y_1,y_2 ) = ( .",

    "-1for different multiplicities in p - p collision at c.m .",
    "energy @xmath14 gev , for @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the results plotted in fig.2 show that the width of @xmath17 is consistent with being independent of multiplicity .",
    "a possible explanation of the width of @xmath17 is cluster decay . comparing with the definition of balance function , eq.(1 )",
    ", we see that it is the difference between the correlations of opposite- and like - charged particles that shows a clear multiplicity dependence , which is unrelated with cluster decay , and is mainly due to the string fragmentation mechanism implemented in pythia model .",
    "the 2-particle correlation function @xmath18 of oppositely charged particles as function of @xmath19 for different multiplicities in p - p collision at c.m . energy @xmath20",
    "gev.,width=240 ]    it can also be seen from fig.1 that the width of balance function depends on collision energy .",
    "for the same multiplicity , the higher the collision energy is , the wider the width of balance function .",

    "to get rid of the influence of the width of rapidity region we calculate the width of balance function in the region @xmath22 for all four energies .",
    "the results , presented in fig .  4 , show that , when the ( average ) rapidity density @xmath23 is the same , the width of balance function is almost independent of energy , especially for high @xmath23 .",
    "that is , in hadron - hadron collisions the width of balance function depends essentially _ only _ on multiplicity and is consistent with being independent on energy .",
    "how does the width of balance function behave in nucleus - nucleus collisions will be studied in the next two sections .",
    "the monte carlo generator ampt1.11 is a multi - phase transport model , which contains a quark - parton transport phase before hadronization .",
    "the initial spatial and momentum distributions of hard partons and soft string excitations are obtained from the hijing  @xcite model .",
    "the parton cascade follows zhang s parton - cascade ( zpc ) model  @xcite , which is based on two - body pqcd scattering with screening masses .",
    "when interaction ceases , the partons are recombined with their parent strings to form hadrons according to lund string fragmentation mechanism  @xcite .",
    "then the scatterings among the resulting hadrons are described by a relativistic transport ( art ) model  @xcite which includes baryon - baryon , baryon - meson and meson - meson elastic and inelastic scatterings .    in our calculation",
    "the parton cross section is chosen to be 10 mb .",
    "if the colliding nuclei are large and the energy is high , then the parton cascade will last long enough to make the parton distribution arrive at an equilibrium distribution  @xcite .",
    "however , no equilibrium thermodynamics has been included in the model . in particular , there is not any equilibrium phase transition from parton phase to hadron phase .",
    "therefore , there is no unique hadronisation time for the whole system .",
    "each parton has its own hadronisation time , or freeze out time @xmath24 .    in order to study the correlation ,",
    "if any , between the width of balance function and the hadronization time , we use the event mean of parton freeze out time @xmath24 = _ i=1^ _ i as the characteristic hadronization time for an event , where @xmath25 is the number of partons in the event , @xmath26 is the freeze out time of the @xmath27th parton .     scattering plots of @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 in au - au collision at @xmath30  gev for two different centralities.,width=307 ]    the ampt1.11 ( default ) generator",
    "is utilized to generate au - au collision events at @xmath30gev .",
    "two event samples with 250,000 and 770,000 events , respectively , are generated for two centralities @xmath31fm and @xmath32fm .",
    "in figs.5 are shown the scattering plots of @xmath28 vs. @xmath33 in au - au collisions at @xmath30  gev for the two different centralities  @xmath31fm and @xmath32fm , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that in central collisions ( @xmath34fm ) @xmath28 is larger than 5fm , while in peripheral collisions ( @xmath35fm ) @xmath28 is concentrated at @xmath36fm .",
    "that is , central collision events hadronize later than peripheral ones .",

    "the distributions of event - mean parton freeze out time @xmath28 for two different centralities in au - au collision at @xmath30  gev.,width=240 ]",
    "in order to study the correlation between the width of balance function and the characteristics of single event  event - mean parton freeze out time @xmath28 and/or multiplicity @xmath33 , each centrality sample is divided into sub - samples according to the intervals of mean parton freeze - out time @xmath28 and the resulting sub - samples are further divided into sub - samples by different multiplicity intervals .",

    "the abscissa of the figure is the average multiplicity in the corresponding multiplicity interval .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that in all cases the width of balance function decreases with the increasing of multiplicity , while in the same multiplicity interval , the width of balance function is consistent of being constant , independent of the hadronization time . therefore , to use the narrowing of balance function in relativistic heavy ion collision as a measure of hadronization time and as a signal of qgp is doubtful .",
