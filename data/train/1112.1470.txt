    "the ultraviolet excess ( uvx ) refers to the phenomenon that the early - type galaxies ( etgs ) exhibit a rising flux with a decreasing wavelength from 2500 to the lyman limit .",
    "theoretical and observational evidence shows that the phenomenon originates from the hot helium - burning horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars and their progeny @xcite .",
    "one of the most important observational constraints to understanding this phenomenon was given by @xcite .",
    "they first explored the systematics of the uv radiation from the 31 local etgs and the bulge of m31 , and found that the uvx strength correlates with the nuclear spectral line index mg@xmath5 ( and , weakly , with the central velocity dispersion and luminosity ) in @xmath6 galaxies . with the advent of the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) satellite @xcite , a large area ,",
    "deep uv imaging survey gathers high - quality data for an unprecedentedly large sample of etgs in the nearby universe . with the galex uv data cross - matched with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @xcite investigated the systematics of the etgs at @xmath7 , but found no correlation of the uvx strength against the mg@xmath5 , d4000 indices or stellar velocity dispersion . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found a tight correlation between the galex uv color and the mg@xmath5 index among the morphologically sorted etgs in the rc3 catalog @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite recovered the correlation of burstein et  al . from the galex uv imagings combined with the high - quality data of the sauron sample , and also with the sdss data for a more distant etg sample .",
    "they argued that such correlations could be seen among the @xmath6 etgs only when the contaminations of star - forming galaxies and low - quality data were much more stringently removed than was done in @xcite .",
    "the uv color  color diagram is another powerful tool to investigate the properties of hot stellar populations responsible for the uvx .",
    "particularly , the capability of the galex to observe the far - uv ( fuv ; 1528 ) and near - uv ( nuv ; 2271 ) bandpasses simultaneously @xcite let us securely estimate the uv spectral shape without instrumental biases .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , the uv color  color diagram , @xmath1 ( as a measure of uv spectral shape ) @xmath2 @xmath3 ( or @xmath8 ; as a measure of uvx strength ) can trace the uv spectral shape and amplitude .",
    "it is also useful to segregate different stellar population systems .",
    "@xcite employed this tool but found no systematic variation among their etgs at @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite presented another example to show that the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are homogenous populations following an old stellar sequence with considerable amounts of color spread .    in this @xmath9 , we expand significantly the sample size of previous studies from the latest data release of the galex and sdss to construct the uv color  color relation of the etgs in the nearby universe , and reexamine our current understanding of uvx .",
    "the initial sample of etgs is selected from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic and photometric database in a rather simplistic way , with the following two criteria : @xmath10 the search volume is limited as above in order to secure an unbiased sample from the sdss spectroscopic survey . at @xmath11 ,",
    "the sdss spectroscopy is incomplete for bright galaxies .",
    "the sdss target selection algorithm of the main galaxy sample allocates the fibers to the galaxies @xmath12 or brighter @xcite .",
    "this magnitude limit corresponds to @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "then , we measure the early - type morphology with the @xmath15 parameter in r - band .",
    "the @xmath15 is a fractional parameter that measures the amount of flux contribution by fitting a galaxy image to a de vaucouleurs surface brightness profile @xcite . by selecting @xmath16 galaxies , our sample secures purely spheroidal galaxies even though a few percent of the sample turn out to be disk galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "those contaminants are removed later from the final sample through visual inspection .",
    "the sdss dr7 database returns an optical catalog of 94,796 galaxies with our querying parameters .",
    "the galex gr6 provides the cross - matched table ( ` xsdssdr7 ` ) against sdss dr7 .",
    "we search this table for the uv sources ( detected both in fuv and nuv images ) matched against the input optical catalog and find a total of 34,388 uv sources cross - matched to a total of 23,493 unique sdss objectids .",
    "about half of the matched sources are observed in the galex all - sky imaging survey ( ais ; @xmath17 ) , and the other half in the medium imaging survey ( mis ) of a single orbit exposure ( @xmath18 ) or in the deep imaging survey ( dis ) of multiple orbits . due to the short exposure time , the galex ais data are highly biased toward star - forming galaxies , whereas the quiescent etgs are well defined in deeper exposure images .",
    "the galex ais data are inadequate for the demographic study of etg populations at these redshifts and hence will be ignored hereafter .    for those etgs detected in sufficiently deep exposure images with the galex",
    ", we analyze their emission line characteristics of the optical spectra .",
    "the emission line strengths in the sdss dr7 spectra are measured by @xcite , and the sample galaxies are classified by the emission line ratios , [ oiii]/h@xmath19 and [ nii]/h@xmath20 @xcite . @xcite provide the amplitude - to - noise ( @xmath21 ) ratio at each emission line to set the analysis threshold . as our main purpose is to secure the @xmath6",
    "( i.e. , no emission line ) etgs as stringently as possible , we loosen the threshold to @xmath22 and classify the sample galaxies into quiescent ( 33% ) , star - forming ( 7% ) , composite ( 12% ) , and agn ( 48% ) categories .",
    "1 shows the color ",
    "magnitude diagrams and color  color diagrams of the cross - matched etg catalog . in the left panels",
    ", our sample of etgs is expressed in the u , g , and r - band magnitudes and the colors sub - grouped according to the emission line characteristics .",
    "the separation among the different spectroscopic subgroups ( especially between the quiescent and agn - host galaxies ) is much more effective in uv colors , as shown in the right panels .",
    "most of the quiescent ( @xmath23 ) galaxies are located in the `` uv red sequence '' , whereas the blue envelop is occupied by star - forming ( @xmath24 ) galaxies .",
    "agn - host ( @xmath25 ) galaxies are spread out in - between in the uv color  color diagram .",
    "we adopt the modelmag ( sdss ) and mag_auto ( galex ) as the total magnitudes of the galaxies in each band .",
    "even though the source extraction apertures are not identically applied between the photometry of the optical and uv images , the aperture effect is small compared to the observational errors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "some e+a galaxies @xcite are found in our data and their uv colors are indicated by asterisks in fig .  1 .",
    "e+a galaxies are located over the wide color ranges ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , but clearly separate from the `` uv red sequence '' .",
    "they appear to be on an evolutionary sequence in which the uv flux fades away after the starburst , and yet fuv declines much faster than nuv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we examine the morphology of individual galaxies in the sdss optical images for those 4025 @xmath28 @xmath6 etgs .",
    "there are still some contaminants of early - type spiral galaxies , mergers , or morphologically disturbed galaxies in our sample .",
    "we find that about 9% of our sample should be rejected in the final sample of quiescent etgs .",
    "this number also includes some possible blends in the galex uv images in the case that there are close neighbors of blue dwarf galaxies around a target etg .",
    "2(a ) shows the colors of such contaminants ( denoted by crosses ) .",
    "note that we eliminate them by the optical morphology only , being blind to their uv or optical colors .",
    "most of those morphological contaminants enter the @xmath6 sample because their optical spectra are taken within the small fiber aperture ( @xmath29 in diameter ) toward the galactic centers , while they do contain young stars in the outer region judged from the strong extended uv emission .",
    "the remaining 3677 @xmath30-@xmath31 @xmath6 etgs consist of a well - defined `` uv red sequence '' as denoted by contours in fig .",
    "2(a ) , with the peak number density at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the uv colors of the final sample of quiescent etgs at @xmath0 are very similar to the color distribution of the local etgs ( fig .",
    "the galex rc3 e ( filled circles ) and s0 ( triangles ) galaxy data are from donas et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and their v magnitudes are converted to r - band with @xmath34 assumed from the 12  gyr elliptical galaxy model in @xcite .    based on the semi - empirical criterion of @xcite , 31% of the quiescent etgs in our sample are classified as the recent star formation ( rsf ) galaxies ( @xmath35 ) , which is consistent with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the observed uv colors of quiescent etgs follow the sequence of a much steeper slope rather than the semi - empirical model line ( i.e. , a harder uv spectral shape at a given uvx amplitude ) . using a sigma - clipping linear fit algorithm to the observed colors iteratively",
    ", we derive the color  color relation , @xmath36 , for the quiescent etgs , which indeed has a steeper slope than that of the semi - empirical model line , i.e. , @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "2(c ) , we empirically define the `` uv red sequence '' ( red dots ) from the linear fit to the observed colors ( solid line ) with 1.5  mag color width ( which corresponds to 3 times the mean absolute deviation of the observed data from the fit line ) in @xmath3 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the uv colors of the bcgs in abell clusters ( filled circles ) fall well into this sequence .",
    "there are still a significant number ( 20% , blue dots ) of outliers from the uv red sequence with this empirical definition , and their additional uv flux should be attributed to the presence of small fractions ( @xmath41% in mass ) of young stars @xcite . the number fraction of such outliers is negligible ( @xmath38 5% ) in the brightest ( @xmath39 ) subgroup , but gradually increases toward the less bright galaxies ( @xmath40 for @xmath13 subgroup ) . we find no substantial difference between the lower redshift ( @xmath41 ) and the higher redshift ( @xmath42 ) subgroups .",
    "all the colors of galaxies presented here are derived from the apparent total magnitudes in each filter with no other corrections applied , except for the galactic extinction @xcite .",
    "the effects of redshift ( @xmath0 ) and evolution ( @xmath43 t @xmath44 1  gyr ) are small compared to the intrinsic color spreads among the sample galaxies and should have little impact on the general morphology of the color  color diagram .",
    "however , better statistics ( e.g. , the number fraction of rsf galaxies ) require the sample galaxies to be at equivalent cosmological distances .",
    "more detailed demographic analysis is in preparation and will be presented in a future paper .",
    "we employ the @xmath45 minimization technique of @xcite to find the best fit model spectra for the observed multiband photometry .",
    "most of the observed data in fig .  2",
    "are well fitted by the two - component models in which the uv spectral shape is determined by the combination of the baseline old ( 12  gyr ) stellar spectra and the varying amount ( 0.01  100% ) of a young ( 0.01  10  gyr ) stellar component . however , the fitting accuracy is poor for the sample of quiescent galaxies in the lower right corner ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) of fig .  2 .",
    "the galaxy in this particular color domain has a very hard uv spectral shape ( comparable to that of ngc  1399 which is one of the strongest uvx galaxies in the local universe ) , but its uvx amplitude is relatively small .",
    "the observed uv colors are compared with other population synthesis models in fig .",
    "we first adopt the composite stellar population ( csp ) model ( t = 12  gyr , @xmath48 ) of @xcite for the baseline model of bulk populations which does @xmath49 contain blue hb stars .",
    "then , in order to simulate the uv color variations due to different types of uv sources , we add the simple stellar populations ( ssps ) of @xmath50 for the young components ( t = 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0  gyr ) and for the old component ( t = 12  gyr , 100% blue hb ) from @xcite models .",
    "the recent models of @xcite are also considered for the helium - enhanced cases ( y = 0.33 , 0.38 , and 0.43 ) .",
    "the flux weight of ssps is assumed to be 10% of the baseline csp model in r - band .",
    "this weight translates roughly to 0.3% ( 0.1  gyr ) , 1.5% ( 1.0  gyr ) , and 10% ( 12  gyr ) in stellar mass fraction .",
    "the top panel shows the uv  optical model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the various possible uv sources , and the uv colors of each toy model are derived from the csp+ssp model seds redshifted to @xmath51 ( median redshift of our sample ) as shown in the bottom panel .",
    "the shaded region in the bottom panel of fig .  3 denotes the canonical models in @xcite where the mean temperature of hb stars smoothly varies according to metallicity and age @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the observed color spreads are much larger than the canonical model predictions spanning large ranges of age ( 11  15  gyr ) and mean metallicity ( 0.5 , 1.0 , and 2.0 @xmath52 ) , and the difference can not be attributed to observational errors or redshift effects .",
    "moreover , the observed slope of the color ",
    "color relation is much steeper than the model predictions , implying that the uvx sources should have a harder uv spectral shape ( i.e. , hotter temperature ) at a given amplitude systematically .",
    "an @xmath53 assumption in the sed combination of @xcite csp ( no blue hb ) and @xcite ssp ( 100% blue hb ) models could produce a somewhat harder uv spectral shape at a given uvx amplitude ( e.g. , @xmath54 ) than the models in @xcite , and yet it is still hard to explain the uv spectral shape of the strongest uvx galaxies at @xmath55 .",
    "we test the recent model prediction of @xcite to determine whether the observed color spreads and the steep slope of the color  color relation might be reproduced with the helium - enhanced stellar populations .",
    "since the helium - rich stars have lower masses at a given age , the mean temperature of helium - rich hb stars is much higher than the normal - helium populations .",
    "this effect is demonstrated well in fig .",
    "the combinations of the baseline csp model and the helium - enhanced ( y = 0.33 and 0.38 ) ssp models would probably explain the uv spectra of the strongest uvx ( @xmath55 ) galaxies under the @xmath53 assumption that all the uv flux originates from the helium - enhanced hb stars only .",
    "an even higher helium abundance ( e.g. , y = 0.43 ) seems unlikely to contribute in this color  color diagram as the hb stars of such high helium abundance are too hot and faint in the galex fuv bandpass .",
    "the uv spectral shapes of the helium - enhanced stars are clearly disentangled from those of the young stars which have a much stronger uv flux both in fuv and nuv at the same optical luminosity .",
    "in summary , we made two main findings with the latest galex uv data of the etgs in the nearby universe .",
    "1 ) the `` old and dead '' etgs consist of a well - defined sequence in uv colors in which the stronger uvx galaxies should have a harder uv spectral shape systematically .",
    "the uv color distributions of etgs at @xmath0 are very similar to those observed for the local rc3 galaxies .",
    "the comparison with the population synthesis models indicates that the hot hb stars are responsible for the observed `` uv red sequence '' , while the contamination of recently - formed young stars can be effectively discriminated in the uv color  color diagram .",
    "2 ) the observed slope of the uv color - color relation of quiescent etgs is too steep to be reproduced by the canonical stellar population models in which the uv flux is mainly controlled by age or metallicity parameters .",
    "moreover , 2  mag of color spreads both in @xmath1 and @xmath3 appear to be ubiquitous among any subsets in distance or luminosity , which can hardly be explained by the canonical models with even large spreads in age ( @xmath56 @xmath572  gyrs ) and mean metallicity ( @xmath56 @xmath570.3  dex ) assumed .",
    "this implies that the uvx in etgs could be driven by yet another parameter which might be even more influential than age or metallicity .",
    "the recent debate on the helium - enhanced populations has an interesting implication for this issue .",
    "observations suggest that there are some helium - enhanced subpopulations in the extended hb globular clusters @xcite and in the massive globular clusters in m87 @xcite .",
    "if present , such subpopulations would steepen the uv spectral slope systematically by increasing the mean temperature of helium burning stars , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 . they would also enhance the uv color spreads among the etg stellar populations with even small variations in the number fractions or in the amount of helium enhancement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whether the postulated helium enhancement in old stellar systems would occur also in galactic scales or in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters @xcite is in question .",
    "observational tests by @xcite and @xcite do not support the helium sedimentation hypothesis , while @xcite argue that the helium abundance is a plausible candidate to explain the uv radial gradient . by the comparison between the uv color distribution and some toy models presented in this @xmath9",
    ", it is suggested that the observed steep slope of the uv color  color relation of etgs would be better explained with the helium - enhanced subpopulations .",
    "the excessive spreads in the uv colors observed among the etgs , besides the variations expected by the age / metallicity spreads , would be attributed to small variations in helium abundance or to the low - level star formation that is hard to be identified with the current survey depths and resolutions of the galex and sdss data .",
