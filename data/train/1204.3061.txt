    "no special phenomenon is expected for he adsorbed on one side of gr because the interaction is similar to that on graphite .",
    "the situation is different for gh and gf due to the modified symmetry of the adsorption potential .",

    "we have studied a single @xmath0he and @xmath1he atom on these substrates , as well as submonolayer films of @xmath0he at coverages similar to that ( @xmath9@xmath7 ) of the @xmath2 r30@xmath3 state on graphite .",
    "graphane and graphene  fluoride have a similar geometry ; half of the h ( f ) atoms are attached on one side of the graphene sheet to the carbon atoms forming one of the two sublattices of graphene .",
    "the other half are attached on the other side to the c atoms forming the other sublattice .",
    "the h ( f ) atoms are located on two planes ( see fig.[fig1]a ) ; one is an overlayer located at a distance h above the pristine graphene plane while the other is an underlayer at a distance h below the graphene plane .",
    "in addition , there is a buckling of the c  plane with the c atoms of one sublattice moving upward by a distance b while the other sublattice moves downward by the same amount . a he atom approaching gh ( gf ) from above will interact primarily with the h ( f ) overlayer , but it will interact also with the c atoms and the h ( f ) atoms of the underlayer .     two schematic views of gf .",

    "are above the centers of each triplets of h ( f ) atoms of the overlayer , forming a honeycomb lattice with the number of sites equal to the number of c atoms , twice as many as those on gr .",
    "half of the sites are above h ( f ) of the underlayer but the difference between the well depths for the two kinds of adsorption sites is very small , below 1% . for gf",
    "the well depth is 498 k and for gh it is 195 k. these values do not include the induced dipole energy which gives a contribution below 1% .",
    "the inter ",
    "site energy barrier is 24 k for gf and 13 k for gh .",
    "both values are significantly smaller than the barrier height 41k for graphite . in this last case",
    "the energy barrier does not depend much on the direction in the @xmath28 plane whereas in the case of gf and gh the ratio between maximum and minimum barrier height in the @xmath28 plane is of order of 45 : the energy landscape of the two last substrates is characterized by a very large corrugation with narrow channels along which low potential barriers are present .",
    "the motion of the he atom , especially in the case of gf , visits only these channels , as though the atom moves in a multiconnected space .",
    "another significant difference is that the distance between two neighboring sites is @xmath61 @xmath30 for gf and @xmath62 @xmath30 for gh whereas it is @xmath63 @xmath30 for graphite and for gr .",
    "prior to these studies , graphite was believed to be the most attractive surface for he , with a well  depth a factor of 10 greater than that on the least attractive surface ( cs ) .",
    "if correct , the present results reveal gf to replace graphite , since its well is a factor of 3 more attractive .",
    "we verified that the electrostatic contribution to @xmath64 is small so we neglected it in this first computation .",
    "we computed the exact ground state energy of one @xmath0he atom or one @xmath1he atom on gf and gh , see table [ table1 ] .",
    "the binding energy on gh is similar to that on graphite , whereas that on gf is about three times that on graphite . in both cases the ground state",
    "is delocalized over the full substrate and both kinds of adsorption sites are occupied with comparable probability .",
    "our computation is based on the path integral ground state ( pigs ) method @xcite . with this method",
    "we can compute quantum averages of the ground state of the system using the quantum evolution in imaginary ",
    "time @xmath65 of a trial wave function @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath66 is not orthogonal to the ground state , and @xmath65 is sufficiently long , the quantum evolution purges from @xmath66 the contributions of the excited states , yielding the ground state energy and wave function .",
    "a valuable feature of the pigs method is that it is exact , in principle ; the results are independent of @xmath66 @xcite and systematic errors may be reduced below the statistical uncertainty .",
    "an additional feature of pigs is that it can be used for a single particle as well as for many ",
    "body bose systems like the system in the study reported in sect .",

    "the ground state is the commensurate @xmath2 r30@xmath3 state with filling factor 1/3 of the adsorption sites .",
    "a similar state on gf is obtained by populating fourth neighbor sites ( this corresponds to second neighbors in one of the sublattices of the honeycomb at a distance 4.482  ) with a filling factor of the adsorption sites equal to @xmath82 and it corresponds to a density @xmath80 @xmath7 .",
    "notice that this density is smaller than the @xmath6 @xmath7 on graphite due to the dilation of the c plane in gf .",
    "we find that this ordered state is unstable : starting the simulation from an ordered configuration after a short monte carlo evolution the bragg peaks corresponding to the @xmath2 r30@xmath3 state disappear and the system evolves into a disordered fluid state modulated by the substrate potential .",

    "we reach a similar conclusion in the case of the gh substrate : the ground state is a liquid with density @xmath96 @xmath7 and @xmath97 k per atom and the bec fraction is @xmath98 % near the equilibrium density and @xmath99 % at @xmath100 @xmath7 .",
    "note that this condensate fraction is significantly smaller than the value ( @xmath101 % ) for @xmath0he in 2d @xcite .",
    "the smaller value is a consequence of the spatial order , albeit imperfect , induced by the substrate potential and of the smaller effective surface available to the atoms due to the strong channeling induced by that potential .",
    "he adsorption on new substrate materials is valuable because of the fundamental importance of helium in many  body physics , with a variety of phases seen in both 2d and 3d .",
    "our results indicate that the gf substrate provides the strongest binding of any surface ( since the previous record was held by graphite ) .",
    "moreover , the novel symmetry , the smaller intersite distance and large corrugation imply that quite novel properties may be anticipated for this system .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "when many @xmath0he atoms are adsorbed on gf and on gh the most striking result is that the ground state is a low density liquid modulated by the substrate potential and the system has bec , i.e. it is a superfluid .",
    "this is qualitatively different from graphite for which the lowest energy state is the @xmath2 r30@xmath3 commensurate one with no bec @xcite .",
    "we have verified that such an ordered state on gf and gh is unstable relative to the liquid phase . in subsequent work we will provide predictions concerning the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties for",
    "both he / gf and he / gh , hoping to stimulate experimental studies of these systems .    it should be noticed that some of the parameters in the adsorption potential are not known with high precision or they have been adopted from other systems .",
    "we have verified that even a change of parameters like @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 by 1020% does not modify the qualitative behavior of the adsorbed he atoms even if there can be a sizable change in the value , for instance , of the adsorption energy .",
    "measurement of thermodynamic properties and he atomic beam scattering experiments from gf and gh will be important to test the accuracy of our model potentials .",
