    "the signature of the pentaquark was found in the experiment with gev photons on @xmath4c at leps of spring8  @xcite . the @xmath5 reaction was analyzed and a narrow resonance state was identified with the mass of @xmath6 and the width smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "such a narrow state was predicted by diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite as a pentaquark state at nearly the same energy .",
    "there were many experimental works published after the original study by using various reactions  @xcite .",
    "recently , many further experiments , particularly at very high energy , report negative results except for a few positive results  @xcite . at this moment , the spin and parity of the state are not known .",
    "even the width is not precisely identified experimentally .",
    "there are many theoretical works  @xcite .",
    "it seems those models , which emphasize the importance of the chiral symmetry , suggest the positive parity ( @xmath8 ) as the original predication of diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the naive constituent quark models tend to provide the negative parity ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the qcd originated works as the lattice qcd and the qcd sum rule approaches seem to provide the negative parity , although these methods face the difficulty of handling the nearby @xmath10 threshold and the small pion mass .",
    "hence , we are at this moment not sure about the presence of the pentaquark state , the spin - parity and even the width of this state  @xcite",
    ".    we should make further efforts to get more information for the pentaquark state .",
    "there are several interesting theoretical works to study the pentaquark in nuclear medium  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors study the interaction of the pentaquark with nucleons using the meson exchange model .",
    "they have obtained a large binding potential with the width to be small to take the pentaquark nucleus seriously .",
    "this work then motivated a theoretical work to calculate the ( @xmath11 ) reaction for the formation of the pentaquark nuclei  @xcite .",
    "there is a good possibility to see @xmath0 hypernucleus in such a reaction .",
    "it is then very interesting to study the @xmath0 hypernucleus from different view point .",
    "we studied nuclei and hypernuclei in terms of the quark mean - field ( qmf ) model  @xcite .",
    "we assume in the qmf model that up and down quarks in the baryons interact with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 mesons ( mesons made of up and down quarks ) in nuclear matter and in nuclei .",
    "hence , the interaction of the @xmath0 with other nucleons is obtained without introducing new parameters in the qmf model .",
    "the only assumption needed here is the isospin of the @xmath0 to be @xmath15 .",
    "the interactions of quarks with the meson fields change the properties of the baryons in hadronic matter and hence the hadronic matter property is obtained from these interactions self - consistently .    in the next section",
    ", we would like to present the formulation of the @xmath0 hypernuclei in the relativistic quark mean - field model . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    ", we provide the numerical results for various @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] will be devoted to the conclusion and discussions .",
    "we start with the description of the @xmath0 in nuclear medium , which is comparable to the treatment of @xmath1 hypernuclei in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 is known to be an exotic baryon containing five quarks ( @xmath16 ) with strangeness @xmath17 , isospin @xmath15 , and charge @xmath18 . however , its parity is still ambiguous experimentally . in this work ,",
    "we use the constituent quark model to describe the @xmath0 and nucleons in medium , while the exchanged mesons couple directly to the quarks inside baryons .",
    "the constituent quarks satisfy the dirac equation : @xmath19 \\phi^q(r ) = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the confining potential taken as the quadratic form , @xmath21 .",
    "because the lorentz structure of the confining interaction is not well known yet , we here use a scalar confinement . in our previous studies for finite nuclei and @xmath1 hypernuclei  @xcite ,",
    "both scalar and scalar - vector confinements have been taken into account , but it is known that antiquarks can not be confined by a scalar - vector confinement when the vector part is equal or larger than the scalar part .",
    "therefore we just adopt the scalar confinement in the present calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the non - strange mesons , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , couple exclusively to the up and down quarks and not to the strange quark ( or antiquark ) according to the ozi rule , hence the strange antiquark inside @xmath0 satisfies the dirac equation in which the terms coupled to the non - strange mesons vanish ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we note that the dirac equation for the strange antiquark @xmath23 in @xmath0 is identical to the equation for the strange quark @xmath24 in @xmath1 when a scalar confining potential is adopted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] ) .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite to take into account the spin correlations and remove the spurious center of mass motion , and then obtain the effective mass of the @xmath0 in medium as @xmath25 while the effective mass of the nucleon is expressed as @xmath26 here , the subscript @xmath27 denotes the @xmath2 or @xmath3 quark .",
    "the energies ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) and momenta ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) can be obtained by solving the corresponding equations . the spin correlations ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , which are taken as parameters in the qmf model , are determined by fitting the baryon masses in free space ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the effective masses of baryons are influenced by the @xmath12 mean - field in nuclear medium , which provides a scalar potential to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks in baryons and as a consequence reduces the constituent quark mass to @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 mean fields could not cause any change in the baryon masses , and they appear merely as the energy shift .",
    "therefore , we obtain the effective masses of baryons as functions of the @xmath12 mean - field , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mstart ] ) and ( [ eq : mstarn ] ) .",
    "we now derive a self - consistent treatment for a @xmath0 hypernucleus , which contains a pentaquark @xmath0 and many nucleons .",
    "the baryons in this system interact through the exchange of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 mesons , just like in the case of a single @xmath1 hypernucleus .",

    "the mean - field values are denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively , while @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the masses of these mesons .",
    "the electromagnetic field , denoted by @xmath46 , couples both to the proton and @xmath0 , which carry a positive charge .",
    "the influences of the @xmath12 mean - field on baryons are contained in the effective masses @xmath47 and @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath13 meson , which couples directly to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks inside baryons , provides an interaction at the hadron level with the coupling constant @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks in the baryon @xmath50 . when @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , we get @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 meson does nt couple to the @xmath0 which is an isoscalar particle , but it couples to the nucleon with the coupling constant @xmath55 , as given in ref .  @xcite . in the qmf model ,",
    "the basic parameters are the quark - meson couplings ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ) , the nonlinear self - coupling constants ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , and the mass of the @xmath12 meson ( @xmath61 ) , which have been determined by fitting the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei in ref .  @xcite .",
    "therefore , no more adjustable parameters exist when it is extended to the calculations for @xmath0 or @xmath1 hypernuclei . from the lagrangian given in eq .",

    "the application of the qmf model to the description of @xmath1 hypernuclei has been reported in our previous work  @xcite . without adjusting any parameters ,",
    "the properties of @xmath1 hypernuclei could be described reasonably well .",
    "the @xmath1 single - particle energies obtained in the qmf model are slightly underestimated in comparison with the experimental values . in the present work",
    ", we investigate the @xmath0 hypernuclei within the qmf model , and then provide the predictions for @xmath0 single - particle energies in light , medium , and heavy nuclei .",
    "in this section , we will present the results calculated in the qmf model for the @xmath0 in nuclear medium .",
    "we need first to specify the parameters used in the present calculation . for the parameters at the quark level , we take the constituent quark masses @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and the strength of the confining potential @xmath73 , as those used in the case of @xmath1 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "the meson masses are taken as @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the quark - meson couplings , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the nonlinear self - coupling constants , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , have been determined by fitting the following equilibrium properties of nuclear matter : equilibrium density @xmath82 ; binding energy @xmath83 ; incompressibility @xmath84 ; effective mass @xmath85 ; symmetry energy @xmath86 . with the above parameters , the qmf model has provided quite satisfactory results for finite nuclei and @xmath1 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "now , we take the same parameters as above to perform the calculations for the @xmath0 in nuclear medium .",
    "it is very interesting to see how the @xmath0 properties change in nuclear matter . in fig . 1 , we present the variation of the effective mass of the @xmath0 , in comparison with those for the nucleon and @xmath1 , as a function of the quark mass correction due to the presence of the @xmath12 mean - field , @xmath87 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the reduction of @xmath88 is larger than those of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , since there are four @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks in the @xmath0 which are influenced by the @xmath12 mean - field , but only three or two quarks influenced in the nucleon or @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the dependence of the effective masses on the @xmath12 mean - field must be calculated self - consistently within the quark model , therefore the effective masses of baryons obtained in the qmf model are not simply linear functions of @xmath12 , as given in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models  @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the ratios of the baryon radii in medium to those in free space as functions of the nuclear matter density .",
    "it is found that all of the baryons , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath91 ( nucleon ) , show significant increase of the radius in nuclear medium , which is consistent with the famous emc effect .",
    "the nucleon gains larger increase of the radius than the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , because all three quarks in @xmath91 are involved in the interactions with mesons while only four - fifths in @xmath0 and two - thirds in @xmath1 involved .",
    "the baryon radii increase by about @xmath92 at normal matter density in the present model . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the scalar and vector potentials of the @xmath0 in medium as functions of the nuclear matter density , and the results of the nucleon ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath1 are also shown for comparison . at @xmath93 , we get @xmath94 and @xmath95 , therefore an residual attractive @xmath0 potential , @xmath96 , is predicted in the present model . for @xmath1 at @xmath97 , we have got the potential @xmath98 , which is about half of the @xmath0 potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a large attractive @xmath0 potential ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath100 at normal matter density was predicted by calculating the @xmath0 selfenergy tied to the @xmath101 decay of the @xmath0 and the two meson baryon decay channels of the @xmath0 partners in an antidecuplet of baryons .",
    "a qcd sum rule calculation  @xcite predicted an attractive @xmath0 potential of about @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the prediction of the @xmath0 potential in the qmf model is compatible with the results obtained by other groups  @xcite .",
    "we now present the results of self - consistent calculations for the @xmath0 hypernuclei containing a @xmath0 bound in nuclei . in fig .",
    "4 , we show the predicted @xmath0 single - particle energies in @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "it is found that there are many bound states of the @xmath0 in light , medium , and heavy nuclei .",
    "we can see that the separation between the deep @xmath0 energy levels is comparable with the @xmath0 width .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the free @xmath0 width in the chiral soliton model is less than @xmath106  @xcite , and the @xmath0 width in medium might be reduced to about one third or less of the free width due to pauli blocking and binding , as pointed out in ref .",
    "it is clear that large separation of the deep @xmath0 levels is helpful to observe distinct peaks in the experiment to produce @xmath0 bound states  @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to compare the results of @xmath0 hypernuclei to those of @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "we can see that the single - particle energy of @xmath107 @xmath0 in @xmath105 is smaller than the one in @xmath104 , which is contrary to the results of @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "this is mainly because @xmath0 carrying a positive charge behaves like a proton in nuclei , while @xmath1 is a charge neutral particle more like a neutron .",
    "the coulomb energies of @xmath0 in heavy nuclei are much larger than those in light nuclei , that @xmath0 single - particle energies in heavy nuclei can be reduced by the large positive coulomb energy .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "5 the scalar , vector , and coulomb potentials in @xmath104 with a @xmath0 bound at @xmath107 state . at the center of the @xmath0 hypernucleus ,",
    "the attractive scalar potential ( @xmath108 ) is partly cancelled by the repulsive vector potential ( @xmath109 ) and coulomb potential ( @xmath110 ) , and as a consequence , an attractive @xmath0 potential ( @xmath111 ) remains in this case .",
    "it is interesting and important to compare the results of the qmf model with those obtained by other groups  @xcite , and discuss the origin of the differences in the @xmath0 single - particle energies .",
    "more bound states of the @xmath0 in nuclei were predicted in some recent works  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors obtained more deeply bound states by solving the schrodinger equation with two potentials : @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "it is obvious that larger @xmath0 single - particle energies should be achieved due to the deeper @xmath0 potentials used in their calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 hypernuclei were studied by using the rmf model with the @xmath0 couplings , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which are the quark model predictions close to those given in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model .",
    "it may be helpful to look at the case of @xmath1 hypernuclei , because of the similarity of the @xmath0 hypernuclei and @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "it is well known that the properties of @xmath1 hypernuclei are very sensitive to the effective coupling constants at the hadron level , especially the two relative couplings @xmath116 and @xmath117  @xcite . the quark model prediction , @xmath118 , usually gives large overbinding of @xmath1 single - particle energies in comparison with the experimental values . for example , by taking tm1 parameter set in the rmf model with @xmath118 , the @xmath107 @xmath1 single - particle energy in @xmath119 is calculated to be @xmath120 , while in the case of the nl - sh parameter set used , it is @xmath121 .",
    "we note that the experimental value of the @xmath107 @xmath1 binding energy in @xmath122 is about @xmath123 .",
    "usually some small deviations from @xmath118 should be taken into account in the studies of @xmath1 hypernuclei in order to reproduce the experimental values  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that about @xmath124 increase from @xmath125 seemed to be needed to improve the overestimated @xmath1 single - particle energies in the qmc model , since the @xmath126 calculated at the quark level in the qmc model was very close to @xmath127  @xcite . on the other hand , the qmf model yielded slightly underestimated @xmath1 single - particle energies due to smaller value than @xmath127 of the @xmath126 obtained in the qmf model , which required about @xmath128 reduction from @xmath125 in order to reproduce the experimental values .",
    "it should be due to the same reason that the qmf model predicts relatively small @xmath0 single - particle energies in comparison with those obtained in the rmf model with the quark model value of the @xmath0 coupling , @xmath129 . in the qmf model , @xmath130 is adopted according to the assumption that non - strange mesons couple only to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks inside baryons , but @xmath131 has to be worked out self - consistently at the quark level .",
    "we notice that the effective @xmath132 couplings in the qmf model are not simply constants as in the rmf model .",
    "therefore , the relative coupling obtained in the qmf model , @xmath133                  /\\left[\\frac{\\partial       m_n^*}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right]$ ] , depends on the @xmath12 mean - field in medium , and we get smaller values than @xmath134 for the @xmath135 in the qmf model .",
    "this is considered as the dominant origin of the differences between the predictions given by the qmf model and those obtained in the rmf model  @xcite .    in order to examine the sensitivity of @xmath0 single - particle energies to the @xmath0 couplings",
    ", we perform the same calculation with a reduced coupling @xmath136 . in this case",
    ", the @xmath107 @xmath0 single - particle energy in @xmath119 changes to be @xmath137 from the value @xmath138 as shown in fig .",
    "4 . hence , @xmath128 reduction of @xmath139 can lead to @xmath140 decrease of the @xmath107 @xmath0 single - particle energy in @xmath119 , and it provides @xmath141 more attraction for the @xmath0 potential in nuclear matter at normal matter density . in the present work ,",
    "we have performed self - consistent calculations for both @xmath0 and nucleons in @xmath0 hypernuclei . by comparing the results of a normal nucleus containing @xmath46 nucleons with those of the @xmath0 hypernucleus containing @xmath46 nucleons and one @xmath0 , the effects of the @xmath0 on nucleons",
    "can be found .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0 does enlarge the scalar and vector potentials of nucleons , but the enlargements are mostly cancelled with each other .",
    "we have studied the properties of the @xmath0 in nuclear matter and performed self - consistent calculations for @xmath0 hypernuclei in the framework of the qmf model , which has been successfully applied to the descriptions of stable nuclei and @xmath1 hypernuclei . in the present work , we have used the constituent quark model to describe the @xmath0 and nucleons , which naturally allows the direct coupling of exchanged mesons with quarks inside baryons . with the parameters determined by the equilibrium properties of nuclear matter and the assumption that non - strange mesons couple only to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks , an attractive @xmath0 potential has been achieved as a consequence of the cancellation between the attractive scalar potential and the repulsive vector potential in nuclear matter .",
    "the qmf model provides an attractive @xmath0 potential of @xmath142 , and yields a reduction of effective @xmath0 mass of @xmath143 as well as @xmath144 increase of the @xmath0 radius at normal matter density .",

    "we comment here a possible method to produce @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
