    "still in the process of emerging from the parent molecular cloud , star clusters younger than about 5myr usually present a developing main sequence ( ms ) and a significant population of pre - ms ( pms ) stars .",
    "however , depending on the initial cluster mass , star - formation efficiency and mass of the more massive stars , the rapid early gas removal ( from supernovae and massive star winds ) may impart important changes to the original gravitational potential .",
    "one consequence of the reduced potential is that stars , especially the low mass ones , moving faster than the scaled - down escape velocity may be driven into the field . over a time - scale of @xmath18myr",
    ", this effect can dissolve most of the very young star clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , estimates ( e.g. @xcite ) predict that only about 5% of the embedded clusters are able to dynamically evolve into bound open clusters ( ocs ) .    on observational grounds , the dramatic changes in the potential affecting the early cluster spatial structure should be reflected on the stellar radial density profile ( rdp ) .",
    "bochum1 ( @xcite ) , for instance , can be an example of this scenario , in which the irregular rdp does not follow a cluster - like profile .",
    "this suggests significant profile erosion or dispersion of stars from a primordial cluster .    in the present paper",
    "we address the case of ngc2244 in the rosette nebula , which is also related to the monocerotisob2 association ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "historically , in colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies some authors centred the large - scale structure on 12mon , which is a bright foreground star of spectral type k0v .",
    "when only wide - field cmds are considered , the adoption of this centre does not affect the results .",
    "however , as will be explored in this work in the context of investigating the cluster structure , that region is definitely at the cluster periphery .    based on shanghai observatory plates with baselines of 34 and 87yr , @xcite derived proper motions ( pms ) and membership probabilities for ngc2244 .",
    "they found mass segregation , but no velocity - mass dependence , indicating a primordial mass segregation related to the star - formation process . with arguments based",
    "on published initial mass functions ( imfs ) and the measured internal velocity dispersion of @xmath19 , they concluded that ngc2244 will be dissolved on a short time - scale .",
    "additionally , in the area of the rosette nebula , the cluster candidate ngc2239 has been frequently included in catalogues , but hardly studied . both ngc2244 and ngc2239 are optical clusters , while the area includes numerous infrared embedded clusters in the rosette molecular cloud ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this work employs 2mass near - ir , , and  photometry .",
    "the 2mass spatial and photometric uniformity allow extractions of wide surrounding fields that provide high star - count statistics .",
    "this property makes 2mass an excellent resource to extract photometry of a broad variety of star clusters , the wide field ones in particular . for this purpose",
    "we have been developing quantitative tools to statistically disentangle cluster evolutionary sequences from field stars in cmds .",
    "decontaminated cmds have been used to investigate the nature of cluster candidates and derive their astrophysical parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "basically , we apply _",
    "( i ) _ field - star decontamination to measure the statistical significance of the cmd morphology , which is fundamental to derive reddening , age , and distance from the sun , and _",
    "( ii ) _ colour - magnitude filters , which are essential for intrinsic stellar rdps , as well as luminosity and mass functions ( mfs ) . in particular , the use of field - star decontamination in the construction of cmds has proved to constrain age and distance more than working with raw ( observed ) photometry , especially for low - latitude ocs ( @xcite ) .",
    "2mass can be deep for nearby young or old ocs .",
    "for instance , our group has studied the young ocs ngc6611 ( @xcite ) and ngc4755 ( @xcite ) .",
    "abundant pre - ms ( pms ) stars were seen in the @xmath20myr old ngc6611 , which is essentially embedded , and a few remaining ones in the @xmath21myr old ngc4755 . as nearby older ocs",
    "we cite ngc2477 ( @xcite ) and m67 ( @xcite ) .                in this paper",
    "we apply our set of analytical tools to the 2mass photometry of the stars in the area of ngc2244 to derive its fundamental parameters , structure and fraction of ms and pms stars .",
    "we also investigate the neighbouring cluster ngc2239 .",

    "col .  6 : cluster / background density contrast parameter ( @xmath25 ) , measured in the colour - magnitude filtered rdps . col .  7 : arcmin to parsec scale",
    ".    most star clusters have rdps that follow a well - defined analytical profile e.g. , the empirical , single mass , modified isothermal spheres of @xcite and @xcite , and the power law with a core of @xcite .",
    "each function is characterised by a different set of parameters that are related to cluster structure . for simplicity and considering the error bars of the rdps in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we adopt the function @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the residual background density , @xmath28 is the central density of stars , and  is the core radius .",

    "the rdp bins corresponding to the neighbouring clusters were ignored in the fit .",
    "the best - fit solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , and the parameters are given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "for absolute comparison with other clusters , table  [ tab3 ] gives parameters in absolute units . within uncertainties ,",
    "the adopted king - like function describes well the colour - magnitude filtered rdp of ngc2239 ( panel d ) along the full radius range .",
    "the same applies only for @xmath29 for the rdp of ngc2244 .",
    "the innermost bin in the ms ( and to a lesser degree to the ms@xmath4pms ) rdp ( panel b ) presents a several @xmath30 excess over the fit .",
    "this rdp cusp basically corresponds to the detached grouping of stars ( with a diameter of @xmath31 ) around hd46150 , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( bottom - right panel ) .",
    "our inner rdp shape agrees with that derived by @xcite with flamingos . in old star clusters , such",
    "a central rdp excess can be attributed to a post - core collapse , like those detected in some gcs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been detected as well in gyr - class ocs , such as , e.g. ngc3960 ( @xcite ) and lk10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "another very young cluster harbouring such a detached core producing an rdp central cusp is ngc6823 ( @xcite ) .",
    "clusters are not expected to dynamically evolve into a post - core collapse on short time - scales , and the cusp must have been caused by star - forming effects .",
    "the compact core within the eroded profile of bochum1 ( @xcite ) can be a long - lived structure in young clusters .",
    "consequently , this central cusp in such a young cluster as ngc2244 suggests a significant deviation from dynamical equilibrium ( sect .",
    "[ discus ] ) .",
    "we also estimate the cluster radius ( ) by visually comparing the cluster rdp and background levels , i.e.  is the distance from the cluster centre where both are statistically indistinguishable ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "most of the cluster stars are contained within @xmath32 , which should not be mistaken for the tidal radius larger than   ( @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the cluster radii of the present objects are given in angular and absolute scales ( table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the density contrast parameter @xmath25 , which is relatively high ( @xmath33 ) for the present rdps , is also given in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "since @xmath34 is measured in colour - magnitude - filtered ( lower noise ) rdps , it is usually higher than the visual contrast produced by images ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    taken at face value , the core radius of ngc2244 ( for the ms@xmath4pms stars )",
    "@xmath35pc would put it beyond the median value of the distribution derived for a sample of relatively nearby ocs by @xcite .",
    "ngc2239 , on the other hand , falls on the low-  tail . besides , assuming the relation tidal radius @xmath36 ( @xcite ) , both clusters fall around the median value of the tidal radius distribution",
    "both clusters clearly present distinct populations of ms and pms stars ( figs .  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) . as the first step to estimate the cluster masses",
    "we build the luminosity functions ( lfs ) in the  band for the ms and pms stars separately , by means of the respective colour - magnitude filters ( sect .",
    "[ cmf ] ) . we show them in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , where the similar age , different distances and number of members are reflected , especially on the different ms and pms cutoffs . in both cases the pms lfs present the expected steep increase towards faint magnitudes ( low - mass stars ) , which confirms that pms stars are an important fraction of the members .    for a more objective investigation on the stellar mass distribution",
    "we build the mfs @xmath37 for the current ms stars that , in turn , can be used to compute the mass stored in stars . similarly to the rdps ( sect .",
    "[ struc ] ) , we work with colour - magnitude filtered photometry to minimise noise .",
    "first we build the lf independently for each 2mass band , both for the cluster region ( @xmath38 ) and comparison field .",
    "the intrinsic lfs are obtained by subtracting the respective ( equal - area ) comparison field lf from that of the cluster .",
    "the intrinsic lfs are transformed into mfs with the mass - luminosity relations obtained from the corresponding age and distance from the sun solutions ( sect .",
    "[ age ] ) .",
    "the final mf is produced by combining the ,  and  mfs into a single mf .",
    "further details on mf construction are given in @xcite .",
    "the effective ms stellar mass ranges are @xmath39 ( ngc2244 ) and @xmath40 ( ngc2239 ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ( bottom panels ) shows , the ms mfs are rather smooth and present different lower and upper masses , which reflects the lower distance and younger age of ngc2244 with respect to ngc2239 .",
    "since pms stars are abundant in both clusters , it is important to build their mf as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( right panels ) we show the evolutionary tracks ( @xcite ) of pms stars of different masses superimposed on the decontaminated cmds of ngc2244 and ngc2239 .",
    "it is clear , especially for ngc2244 , that pms stars less massive than 1  are the most abundant component .",
    "similarly to the ms , the pms mfs are built with the number of pms stars among any two tracks in the cluster region and comparison field .",
    "finally , we add the ms and pms mfs to produce the total mf of each cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "the number of ms ( @xmath41 ) and pms ( @xmath42 ) members in ngc2244 ( for @xmath43 ) are derived by counting the stars in the background - subtracted colour - magnitude filtered photometry .",
    "we apply the same approach as above to compute the pms mass .",
    "there are @xmath44 and @xmath45 stars ; the corresponding mass values are @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( computed assuming the average mass between any two evolutionary tracks in fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "thus , the total stellar mass of ngc2244 is @xmath48 , which agrees with the 770  mass estimated by @xcite .",
    "we note that this value is about 10% of the mass estimated by @xcite for ngc2244 .",
    "however , this difference may arise from the present detailed analysis - especially the decontamination and the separation of ms and pms stars in the construction of the cluster mf .",
    "the same analysis applied to ngc2239 yields @xmath44 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and the total stellar mass @xmath10 , about half the mass of ngc2244 .    considering the ms stars isolately , the mfs can be well represented by the function @xmath52 , with the slopes @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively for ngc2244 and ngc2239 .",
    "both values are flatter than the @xmath55 of @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "a flat mf slope was also found for ngc2244 by @xcite .",
    "however , when the ms and pms stars are taken together , the slopes become steeper , @xmath3 and @xmath16 . while within uncertainties",
    "the total mf of ngc2239 is comparable to the @xcite imf , the mf of ngc2244 remains somewhat flatter , but still consistent with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "constrained by isochrone fits ( sect .",
    "[ age ] ) , we could derive fundamental and structural parameters of the young ocs ngc2244 and ngc2239 , part of them for the first time .",
    "we use them to compare some of their properties with those of well - studied ocs .",
    "we further investigate the nature of ngc2244 and ngc2239 with diagrams that examine relations among astrophysical parameters of ocs in different environments .",
    "they were introduced by @xcite . as reference sample",
    "we use some bright nearby ocs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and a group of ocs projected towards the central parts of the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "also included are the young ocs ngc6611 with the age @xmath56myr ( @xcite ) , ngc6823 with @xmath57myr and bochum1 with @xmath58myr ( @xcite ) . ngc6611 and ngc6823",
    "serve as comparison with gravitationally bound objects of similar age , while bochum1 is a star cluster fossil remain that might be dynamically evolving into an ob association .",
    "the full sample of comparison ocs is characterised by ages in the range @xmath56myr to @xmath59gyr , and galactocentric distances within @xmath60 .",
    "their parameters have been obtained following the same prescriptions as those for ngc2244 and ngc2239 .",
    "the diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , where panels ( a ) and ( b ) examine the dependence of cluster ( ) and core ( ) radii on cluster age , respectively .",
    "most of the small - radius ocs ( especially in ) occur at an age @xmath61gyr , the typical time - scale of oc disruption processes near the solar circle ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . both ngc2244 and ngc2239 present a cluster radius comparable to that of ngc6611 ( and in general equivalent to other young ocs ) .",
    "the same applies to the core radius of ngc2239 .",
    "ngc2244 , on the other hand , has an  too large when compared to the reference ocs .",
    "core and cluster radii of the reference ocs follow the relation @xmath62 ( panel c ) , suggesting a similar scaling for both kinds of radii .",
    "while ngc2239 fits tightly in that relation , ngc2244 deviates again probably because of the exceeding cluster radius .",
    "a dependence of oc size on galactocentric distance is suggested by panel ( d ) , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while ngc2244 follows the trend , ngc2239 deviates somewhat",
    ". this relation may be partly primordial , in the sense that the high molecular gas density in central galactic regions may have produced small clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "after formation , mass loss due to stellar and dynamical evolution ( e.g. mass segregation and evaporation ) , together with tidal interactions with the galactic potential and giant molecular clouds , also contribute to the depletion of star clusters , especially the low - mass and centrally located ones .",
    "when the mass - density radial distribution follows a king - like profile ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the cluster mass inside  can be computed as a function of the core radius ( ) and the central mass - surface density ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 $ ] . with the above relation ( panel c ) between  and ,",
    "this equation becomes @xmath65 .",
    "the observed relation of core radius and cluster mass is examined in panel ( e ) .",
    "the reference ocs , together with ngc2239 are contained within king - like distributions with central mass densities within @xmath66 . ngc2244 appears to have too big a core radius for its total mass .",
    "finally , when the total ( ms@xmath4pms ) mf slope is considered ( panel f ) , ngc2239 and especially ngc2244 , appear to have mfs flatter than those of similarly young ocs . on the other hand , their slopes are equivalent to those derived for some old ocs in the reference sample . in general ,",
    "flat mfs reflect advanced dynamical evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "what follows from the above analysis is that while ngc2239 appears to be characterised by parameters of a typical young oc , ngc2244 , on the other hand , exhibits evidence of a system far from dynamical equilibrium , which agrees with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we employ the wide - field and near - ir depth provided by 2mass to focus on the rosette nebula cluster ngc2244 and the nearby projected oc ngc2239 .",
    "our approach relies essentially on field - star decontaminated 2mass photometry , which enhances cluster cmd evolutionary sequences and stellar radial density profiles , producing more constrained fundamental and structural parameters .",
    "previous studies were mostly based on optical photometry and/or near - ir with small angular fields .",
    "however , 2mass can still provide additional insight ( sect .",
    "[ photom ] ) .",
    "the set of tools developed by our group allowed to unambiguously isolate ms and pms stars that , in turn , resulted in well - defined cmds , rdps and mass functions .",
    "in addition , we explore proper motion properties to investigate the other cluster in the area , ngc2239 .",
    "taken together , the ( decontaminated ) ms and pms sequences of ngc2244 provided an age range 16myr , an absorption @xmath0 , and a distance from the sun @xmath1kpc ( @xmath2kpc outside the solar circle ) .",
    "these parameters are consistent with most of the previous estimates .",
    "the ( ms@xmath4pms ) mf slope @xmath3 is somewhat flatter than the @xcite imf . with a total ( ms@xmath4pms ) stellar mass of @xmath67 derived in the present work , ngc2244 is not as massive as previously estimated ( sect .",
    "[ recadd ] ) .",
    "the king - like profile fit to the ( ms@xmath4pms ) stellar rdp was obtained with a core radius @xmath68pc ; the corresponding cluster radius is @xmath69pc .",
    "compared to a set of well - known ocs , the core radius of ngc2244 appears to be abnormally big , which puts it at unusual loci in the structural / dynamical diagnostic - diagrams ( sect .",
    "ngc2244 has a central cusp that can not be fitted by e.g. , a king s law .",
    "this cusp is probably due to a star - formation effect , and not the product of dynamical evolution .",
    "we conclude that ngc2244 is not in dynamical equilibrium , consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
