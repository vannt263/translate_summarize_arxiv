    "however , in all cases the fundamental problem which is at the heart of the difficulty is the local constraint problem . to illustrate it ,",
    "let s consider e.g. , first class of representations .",
    "introducing the auxiliary fermi or bose fields makes the dimensionality of the hilbert space , where these operators act , greater than the dimensionality of the hilbert space for the spin operators . as a result",
    ", the spurious unphysical states should be excluded from the consideration which leads in turn to some restrictions ( constraints ) on bilinear combinations of fermi / bose operators , resulting in substantial complication of corresponding rules of the diagrammatic technique .",
    "the representations from the second class suffer from the same kind of problem , transformed either into a high nonlinearity of resulting model ( non - linear sigma model ) or hierarchical structure of perturbation series in the absence of wick theorem ( hubbard operators ) .",
    "the exclusion of double occupied and empty states for a @xmath0 impurity interacting with conduction electron bath ( single impurity kondo model ) , is controlled by fictitious chemical potential ( lagrange multiplier ) of abrikosov pseudofermions @xcite . at the end of calculations this `` chemical potential '' @xmath2 should be put @xmath3 to `` freeze out '' all unphysical states . in other words",
    ", there exists an additional @xmath4 gauge field which freezes the charge fluctuations associated with this representation .",
    "the method works for dilute systems where all the spins can be considered independently .",
    "unfortunately , attempts to generalize this technique to the lattice of spins results in the replacement of the local constraint ( the number of particles on each site is fixed ) by the so - called global constraint where the number of particles is fixed only on an average for the whole crystal .",
    "there is no reason to believe that such an approximation is a good starting point for the description of the strongly correlated systems .",
    "another possibility to treat the local constraint rigorously is based on majorana fermion representation . in this case",

    "based on the exact fermionic representation for @xmath0 and @xmath6 operators , where the constraint is controlled by purely imaginary lagrange multipliers , these authors demonstrated the power and simplification of the corresponding matsubara diagram technique .",
    "the semi - fermionic representation ( we discuss the meaning of this definition in the course of our paper ) used by popov and fedotov is neither fermionic , nor bosonic , but reflects the fundamental pauli nature of spins .",

    "we show a `` bridge '' between different representations using the simplest example of @xmath6 in @xmath1 and discuss the sf approach for @xmath8 group .",
    "finally , we show how to work with semi - fermions in real - time formalism and construct the schwinger - keldysh technique for sf . in this section",

    "the reader acquainted with semi - fermionic technique can easily skip this section . in section",
    "ii , we illustrate the applications of sf formalism for various problems of condensed matter physics , such as ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and resonance valence bond ( rvb ) instabilities in the heisenberg model , dicke model , large negative - u hubbard and t - j models , competition between local and non - local correlations in kondo lattices in the vicinity of magnetic and spin glass critical points , dynamical symmetries in quantum dots , spin chains and ladders . in the epilogue , we discuss some open questions and perspectives .",

    "to begin with , we briefly reproduce the arguments contained in the original paper of popov and fedotov . let s assume first @xmath0 .",
    "we denote as @xmath9 the hamiltonian of spin system .",

    "to prove equation ( [ pf1 ] ) we note that the trace over the nonphysical states of the @xmath11-th site vanishes @xmath19 thus , the identity ( [ pf1 ] ) holds .",

    "we show how semi - fermionic ( popov - fedotov ) representation can be derived using the mapping of partition function of the spin problem onto the corresponding partition function of the fermionic problem .",

    "we denote the corresponding distribution by @xmath54 , where @xmath41 is the number of particles in the su(@xmath17 ) orbital , or in other words , @xmath55 labels the different fundamental representations of su(@xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath56 to satisfy this requirement , the minimal set of chemical potentials and the corresponding form of @xmath54 are to be derived ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "to derive the distribution function , we use the following identity for the constraint ( [ const1 ] ) expressed in terms of grassmann variables @xmath57 substituting this identity into ( [ z1 ] ) and comparing with ( [ z2 ] ) one gets @xmath58 where @xmath59 since the hamiltonian is symmetric under the exchange of particles and holes when the sign of the lagrange multiplier is also changed simultaneously , we can simplify ( [ eq : p_v1 ] ) to @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the integer part of @xmath62 . as shown below",

    ", the representation we discussed was purely fermionic and expressed in terms of usual grassmann variables when the path integral formalism is applied .",
    "the only difference from slave fermionic approach is that imaginary lagrange multipliers are introduced to fulfill the constraint .",
    "nevertheless , by making the replacement @xmath75 we arrive at the generalized grassmann ( semi - fermionic ) boundary conditions @xmath76 this leads to a temperature diagram technique for the green s functions @xmath77 of semi - fermions with matsubara frequencies different from both fermi and bose representations ( see fig.[fig : frequencies_spin ] ) .",
    "+    the exclusion principle for this case is illustrated on fig.[fig : su(n)_rep ] , where the @xmath0 representation for the first two groups su(2 ) and su(4 ) are shown .",

    "( [ eq : mu_k ] ) shows that the two phase factors @xmath80 and @xmath81 accompanying these subspaces in eq .",
    "( [ dfu ] ) add up to a purely imaginary value within the same lagrange multiplier , and the empty and the fully occupied states are always cancelled . in the case of @xmath82 , where we have multiple lagrange multipliers , the distribution function @xmath83 linearly combines these imaginary prefactors to select out the desired physical subspace with particle number @xmath84 .    in fig.[fig",
    ": su(n)_rep ] , we note that on each picture , the empty and fully occupied states are cancelled in their own unit circle . for su(2 ) there is a unique chemical potential @xmath85 which results in the survival of single occupied states . for su(4 ) there are two chemical potentials ( see also fig.[fig : frequencies_spin ] ) . the cancellation of single and triple occupied states",
    "is achieved with the help of proper weights for these states in the distribution function whereas the states with the occupation number 2 are doubled according to the expression ( [ nn2 ] ) . in general , for su(@xmath17 )",

    "we note that in @xmath115 ( or @xmath67 ) limit , the continuum `` chemical potentials '' play the role of additional u(1 ) fluctuating field whereas for finite @xmath86 and @xmath17 they are characterized by fixed and discrete values .",
    "when @xmath86 assumes integer values , the minimal fundamental set of matsubara frequencies is given by the table in fig.[fig : frequencies_spin ] .",
    "the exclusion principle for su(2 ) in the large spin limit can be also understood with the help of fig.[fig : su(n)_rep ] and fig.[fig : spin_rep ] .",
    "one can see that the empty and the fully occupied states are cancelled in each given circle similarly to even-@xmath17 su(@xmath17 ) algebra .",
    "the particle - hole ( ph ) symmetry of the representation results in an equivalence of single occupied and @xmath95 occupied states whereas all the other states are cancelled due to proper weights in the distribution function ( [ lsu ] ) . in accordance with ph symmetry",
    "being preserved for each value of the chemical potential all circle diagrams ( see fig.3 , fig.5 ) are invariant with respect to simultaneous change @xmath116 and @xmath117 .      in this chapter",
    "we show the way of generalization of semi - fermionic representation to the dynamical algebras @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( see appendix a ) . like in the case of pure spin operators , these representations should preserve all kinematical constraints .",
    "the first step to derive semi - fermionic representation for so(4 ) group is based on the local isomorphism of @xmath8 and @xmath121 .",
    "we start with @xmath122 - field representation of @xmath1 group ( [ fermi ] ) @xmath123 there are two diagonal and two off - diagonal constraints ( [ gconst ] ) which read as follows : @xmath124 @xmath125 and generators of @xmath1 group are given by @xmath126 @xmath127 combining definition ( [ sz ] ) with constraint ( [ so4c1 ] ) we reach the following equations : @xmath128 therefore , we conclude that the antisymmetric ( singlet ) combination @xmath129 does not enter the expression for spin @xmath6 operators .",
    "thus , three ( out of four ) component fermi - field is sufficient for the description of @xmath6 @xmath1 representation in agreement with ( [ su2 ] ) . defining new fields as follows @xmath130 where fermions @xmath131 stand for @xmath132 projections of the triplet state and fermion @xmath133 determines the singlet state , we come to standard @xmath6 @xmath1 representation @xmath134 with the constraint @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "the constraint ( [ so4c2 ] ) transforms to a standard @xmath1 @xmath6 constraint ( [ const2 ] ) in both cases @xmath137 and @xmath138 since there is no singlet / triplet mixing allowed by @xmath1 algebra .    to demonstrate the transformation of the local constraint",
    "let s first consider the case @xmath137 .",
    "the constraint reads as follows    @xmath139    on the other hand , the states with @xmath95 occupation are equivalent to the states with single occupation due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "thus , the constraint ( [ so4c2 ] ) might be written as @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to @xmath138 .",
    "the singlet / triplet mixing is allowed for @xmath8 group .",
    "this mixing is described in terms of 3 additional generators responsible for transitions between singlet and triplet ( see appendix a ) . using 4-component auxiliary fermions @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and matrix form of generators ( [ matrix ] ) we represent @xmath144 - generators of @xmath8 as follows @xmath145 with the only constraint @xmath146 whereas the orthogonality condition @xmath147 is fulfilled automatically .",
    "the constraint ( [ const ] ) is respected by means of introducing real chemical potential @xmath148 for abrikosov s auxiliary fermions or imaginary chemical potentials @xmath149 for popov - fedotov semi - fermion .    the fermionic representation of @xmath150 group is easily constructed by use semi - fermionic representation and is characterized by 5-vector @xmath151 @xmath152 and @xmath153 the constraint @xmath154 is respected either by real infinite chemical potential ( abrikosov pseudofermions ) or by set of complex chemical potentials ( semi - fermions ) .",
    "we do not present here ten @xmath155 matrices characterizing @xmath150 representation to save a space . the reader can easily construct them using representations ( [ fff ] ) .",
    "there exists also a bosonic representation based on schwinger bosons which might be derived by the method similar to used above for @xmath8 group .",
    "the representations of higher @xmath156 groups can be constructed in a similar fashion .",
    "kinematic constraints imposed on auxiliary fermions and bosons is in strict compliance with the casimir and orthogonality constraints in spin space .",
    "accordingly , the number of fermionic and bosonic fields reproduces the dimensionality of spin space reduced by these constraints .",
    "we have seen that the 6-d space of generators of @xmath8 group is reduced to d=4 . then the minimal ( unconstraint ) fermionic representation for",
    "this group should contain two @xmath4 fermions .",
    "this means that the representation ( [ 4 ] ) is not minimal .",
    "apparently , the best way to find such representation is to use jordan - wigner - like transformation @xcite .",
    "the exact form of jordan - wigner transformation for @xmath8 group was recently reported in @xcite .",
    "the same kind of arguments applied to @xmath150 group tells us that the spinor field should contain seven components .",
    "this means that the 3-color u(1 ) fermionic representation should be completed by one more real ( majorana ) fermion , and this fact points to one more hidden @xmath5 symmetry @xcite .",
    "we discuss finally the real - time formalism based on the semi - fermionic representation of su(@xmath17 ) generators .",
    "this approach is necessary for treating the systems out of equilibrium , especially for many component systems describing fermi ( bose ) quasiparticles interacting with spins .",
    "the real time formalism @xcite , @xcite provides an alternative approach for the analytical continuation method for equilibrium problems allowing direct calculations of correlators whose analytical properties as function of many complex arguments can be quite cumbersome .    to derive the real - time formalism for su(@xmath17 ) generators we use the path integral representation along the closed time keldysh contour ( see fig.[fig : keldysh ] ) .    following the standard route @xcite",
