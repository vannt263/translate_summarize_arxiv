    "an increasing number of space missions of astrophysical interest are avoiding orbits around the earth , to improve their environmental conditions .",
    "in particular , orbits far from the earth around the lagrangian point of the earth - sun system ( @xmath1 ) are currently being selected especially by infrared and microwave missions , like @xmath0 by nasa ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) and planck ( tauber 2000 ) , herschel ( pilbratt 2000 ) and gaia ( perryman 2001 ) by esa . while this solution is often essential for the successful scientific return of the missions , non - trivial practical problems need to be solved ; among these , the visibility of the spacecraft from the ground station .",
    "if the spacecraft is not visible all the time , it needs to have some built - in autonomy to perform its functions independently from ground control .    in particular ,",
    "both house - keeping and scientific data need to be stored on - board , to be subsequently down - linked to the ground station during the next period of visibility .",
    "the data have to be  safely \" transmitted to earth , with minimal loss of data during the communications period , due to the high cost of each telemetry ( tm ) packet for space missions and to the wealth of scientific information encoded in each packet .",
    "however some information will be eventually lost , since the cost of guaranteeing completely faultless communications and ground systems would be unbearable , if ever feasible .",
    "therefore , great attention has to be devoted to assess the total amount of tm that it is possible to loose without affecting the scientific return of the considered space mission .    in this paper",
    "we want to address this issue and we adopt a monte - carlo ( mc ) approach to take more easily and faithfully into account the properties of the observing strategy of the experiment under consideration . as a working case we consider the impact of tm losses for the planck low frequency instrument ( lfi , see mandolesi et  al .",
    "1998 ) , designed to map the whole sky in temperature and polarization at frequencies between 30 and 100  ghz and observe the cmb anisotropy with an angular ( fwhm ) resolution from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and a sensitivity per ( fwhm@xmath4 ) resolution element from @xmath5 to 13  @xmath6k in the measure of the antenna temperature fluctuations ( @xmath7 worst in the measure of fluctuations of the stokes polarization parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is , however , worth to note that the formalism and approach developed here are quite general and applicable in practice to any kind of experiment with redundant observing strategy ( like @xmath0 ) , _ i.e. _ where the same sky region is observed on several different time scales . for the specific working case adopted a total number of 100,000 simulations representing real cases of lost tm have been considered and analyzed in terms of probability of not observing sky regions and of dimension of unobserved regions .",
    "our approach works once details on the observing strategy of the mission under consideration are available and properly coded .    in our working case",
    "the orbit selected for the planck satellite is a tight lissajous orbit around the @xmath1 lagrangian point of the sun - earth system .",
    "the spacecraft spins at @xmath10 1 rpm and , in the simplest scanning strategy , the spin axis is kept on the anti - solar direction at constant solar aspect angle by a re - pointing of 2.5@xmath11 every hour .",
    "the two intruments ( lfi and the high frequency instrument , see puget et  al .",
    "1998 ) on the focal plane of an aplanatic telescope of 1.5 meter aperture have a field of view at @xmath12 from the spin - axis direction .",
    "they therefore trace large circles in the sky and the 1-hour averaged circle is the basic planck scan circle . in the nominal 14 months mission @xmath10",
    "10,200 basic circles will be considered , covering twice nearly the whole sky , @xmath10  5,100 circles for each sky coverage .",
    "data continuously acquired are packed into tm packets and sent to a single ground station ( located in perth - australia ) during the connection period ( 23 hours a day ) . in case of failure of communications with the ground station data",
    "can be stored on - board for a maximum amount of 48 hours of data .",
    "after this period data are progressively deleted and lost .",
    "as for other missions , at least 95% of the total tm is guaranteed to be finally available for further analysis .",
    "higher percentages of received tm , for example up to 98% , may require another operating ground antenna , and/or have other large additional costs .",
    "we observe that loosing the 5% ( 2% ) of the @xmath10  5,100 scan circles of a single sky coverage means to lose @xmath10  10 ( 4 ) 24-hour - tm - blocks , corresponding to a set of unobserved `` stripes '' with a global width of @xmath10  10@xmath13 ( 4@xmath13 ) at low ecliptic latitudes .",
    "it is therefore of paramount importance to evaluate the impact of the lost tm on the effective sky coverage .    in the specific case of planck - lfi ,",
    "the antenna beams corresponding to the various feed horns arranged in the focal plane are located on a ring subtending an angular radius of about @xmath14 on the telescope field of view about the telescope optical axis .",
    "the focal plane arrangement of the feed horns at different frequencies shows potentially dangerous situations for the 30  ghz channels ( only 2 placed along the same scan direction ) and the 70  ghz ( placed along a small arc with an extension of only @xmath15  degree in the direction orthogonal to the scan direction ) . in these cases",
    "there is no possibility to compensate for the loss of a given sky area with retained tm observed by other detectors at the same frequency .",
    "this is for example the case of the 100  ghz channels , that span an angle of about 3 - 4 degrees : sky is effectively lost only if it is not possible to communicate with the satellite for more than 3 days , or if the data stored on - board are not downlinked in time .",
    "the first is a very unlikely case , while to cope with the second , an appropriate downlinking strategy shall be devised .",
    "it is worth to mention that a similar situation is valid also for , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath0 and gaia . however to properly address the issue of loosing tm packets for these missions , details on their observing strategy as well as on - board data storage capabilities are required .      when coding the properties of the planck observing strategy , we made some simplifying assumptions for the only purpose of computing the percentage of lost tm :    * each sky coverage ( @xmath16 7 months long ) is composed of an integer number of scan circles ; * the number of scan circles is the same for each sky coverage ; * scan circles from subsequent sky coverages overlap exactly ; * tm is lost in chunks 48 or 24 hours long ( the first is the total amount of data that can be stored on - board and implies having lost 2 or 1 complete days of data ) .",
    "furthermore , the pointing stability of the spacecraft @xcite assures that the real situation will be not much different from the case considered here .",
    "given the mission duration and percentage of lost tm we randomly extract from the full tm stream the lost scan circles .",
    "we then overlap the different sky coverages to form a single tm stream that refers to the whole sky . in this stream",
    "we consider the total number of scan circles lost , their mean and their maximum dimension .",
    "we ran over 100,000 mc simulations to derive the probability distribution function of the lost tm .",
    "we assume two different mission durations implying 2 and 3 complete sky coverages . each single sky coverage is composed of a total of 5,100 individual 1 hour scan circles ( corresponding to @xmath16 7 months ) .",
    "two total amounts of lost tm are considered : 5 and 2% .    in table",
    "i we report results from our simulations respectively for 48 and 24 hours blocks of lost tm : @xmath17 is the percentage of simulations with no loss of scan circles at all after coadding a given number of sky coverages ( sc ) while @xmath18 is the percentage of simulations for which at least one scan circle is lost at the end of the coadding procedure .",
    "the other two columns report the mean and maximum number of scan circles lost in our 100,000 simulations .",
    ".results from 100,000 simulations with realistic loss of tm [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     inspection of table",
    "ii shows that the area of lost sky depends on the pixel size of the map only weakly : when the pixel size decreases by a half the area of the lost sky increases only by a tiny fraction .",
    "the improvement represented by the case of 5% lost tm with 3 sky coverages with respect to the case with 2% lost tm but only 2 sky coverages is quite clear .",
    "we have derived through mc simulations the probability of loosing tm packets for a space - borne instrument performing a full - sky survey .",
    "of course , it is obvious that the best results for a sky coverage in terms of completeness are obtained when the largest fraction of tm is retained and the number of repeated full sky observations is increased .",
    "however , our analysis clearly shows that it is better to cover the sky more times with a lower fraction of tm retained than less times with a higher tm fraction .",
    "in this respect we note that the 5 year full sky mission gaia assumes 5 repetitions of essentially the same scanning strategy , year by year . even in the most conservative case in which a given sky region is observed only one time per year , and considering that : _ i ) _ the total capacity of the on - board data recorder is about 1 day , _ ii ) _",
    "one day is also the time scale for the @xmath19 re - pointing of the symmetry axis of gaia scanning strategy , and _",
    "iii ) _ the field of view is about @xmath20 ( not far from the planck beam size at lower frequencies ) , we have a probability to loose a given sky region with 95% of guaranteed tm is less that @xmath21% .",
    "this is another remarkable example in which the increase in the number of full sky surveys of the mission allows to significantly reduce the probability of loosing scientific information .    in a space mission ,",
    "trading off the pergentage of guaranteed tm delivered to the ground versus number of full sky surveys has an impact in terms of costs : the setup needed to guarantee a higher tm fraction may imply more ground stations to follow the satellite and more ground personnel .",
    "cost - wise , it could be preferable to make an extension of mission time that implies , _ e.g. _ in the case of planck , only another seven months of operations . in any case",
    ", a careful costs - to - benefits analysis needs to be carried out ."
