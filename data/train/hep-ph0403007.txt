    "the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of fermions are worthwhile to study since their origin is the cp violating interaction , which is weak in the standard model and it pushes one to investigate new models beyond .",
    "there are number of experimental results on the fermion edms in the literature .",
    "the electron , muon and tau edms have been measured experimentally as @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite respectively and the experimental upper bound of neutron edm has been found as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive theoretical work done on the edms of fermions .",
    "the calculations of quark edms in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite has shown that the non - zero contribution existed at the three loop level @xcite and they were estimated as @xmath6 , which is a negligible quantity . in this case , the complex phase , which is the source of cp violation , is coming from the complex cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "since the numerical results of fermion edms are tiny in the sm , there is enough reason to analyze these physical quantities in the framework of new physics beyond .",
    "there are many sources of cp violation in the models beyond the sm , such as multi higgs doublet models ( mhdm ) , supersymmetric model ( susy ) , extra dimensions @xcite , ... , etc .",
    "the edms of quarks was calculated in the multi higgs doublet models @xcite , including the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) . in these calculations @xmath1-quark and @xmath0-quark edms were obtained as @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in @xcite , it was observed that the new contributions due to the @xmath9 particles vanished at the two loop order with the assumption that the cp violating effects came from only the ckm matrix elements and @xmath9 particles also mediated cp violation besides @xmath10 bosons . in @xcite , it was concluded that the enhancement of three orders of magnitude in the electric dipole form factor of the @xmath1 quark with respect to the prediction of 2hdm i and ii was possible .",
    "@xcite is devoted to the calculation of leading contribution to the edm of the top quark in higgs - boson - exchange models of cp nonconservation and the dipole moments were estimated of the order @xmath11 . in @xcite lepton electric dipole moments in the supersymmetric seesaw model has been studied . in @xcite ,",
    "the edm of the electron has been predicted as @xmath12 as @xmath13 using the experimental result of @xmath14 and the upper limit of @xmath15 . the work @xcite is devoted to quark and lepton edm moments in the framework of the sm with the inclusion of non - commutative geometry . in recent works , the edms of nuclei , deutron , neutron and",
    "some atoms have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "our work is devoted to the investigation of the fermion edms in the case that the cp violating interactions are carried by complex yukawa couplings appearing in the flavor changing ( fc ) neutral current vertices , in the model iii version of the 2hdm , with the inclusion of the extra dimensions .",
    "there is an extensive work on the extra dimensions in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main motivation of such dimensions is to find a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem of the sm .",
    "the effects of each extra dimension is felt with the production of kaluze - klein ( kk ) states of the fields , which are obtained after the compactification on a circle of radius r. the number @xmath16 is known as the compactification scale and the its size have been estimated in the range @xmath17 , using electroweak precision measurements @xcite , the @xmath18 -mixing @xcite , @xcite and the flavor changing process @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this size has been obtained as large as few hundereds of gev in several works @xcite .",
    "if all the fields live in higher dimensions @xcite , such extra dimensions are called as universal extra dimensions ( ued s ) , and in this case the extra dimensional momentum , and therefore the kk number at each vertex , is conserved . as a result of kk number conservation ,",
    "the kk modes enter into the calculations as loop corrections . however , if some of the particles do not feel the extra dimensions and others do , namely non - universal extra dimension case , the coupling of two zero modes with the kk mode is switched on and the contributions of extra dimensions to the tree level processes become non - zero .    in the present work , we consider the effects of non - universal extra dimensions on the edms of fermions by assuming that the new higgs doublet and the gauge sector feel the extra dimensions , however , the other sm fields do not feel and are confined on 4d brane .",
    "notice that in the case of ued , where all the fields are accessible to the extra dimensions , there does not exist any new contribution to the fermion edms due to the kk modes of higgs fields and fermions , at least in the one loop level .",
    "the higher dimensional effects on the edms of fermions are carried by the intermediate charged , @xmath20 , and neutral higgs , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , fields with the vertices including `` two zero modes - kk mode '' .",
    "we study those additional effects for one and two spatial extra dimensions .    in the numerical calculations",
    ", we observe that the @xmath0 quark and @xmath1 quark edms are sensitive to the extra dimension , especially the double one , however , in the case of charged lepton edms , this sensitivity is relatively weak",
    ". therefore , the future accurate measurements of edms of fermions may be an effective tool to check the existence and the number of extra dimensions and the restriction of the compactification scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present edms of fermions , t - quark , b - quark and charged leptons , in the model iii version of the 2hdm with the inclusion of the non - universal extra dimensions .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the existence of the fermion edm depends on the cp violating fermion - fermion - photon interaction . in the framework of the sm",
    ", the cp violation is carried by the complexity of the cabbibo cobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and the estimated numerical values of edms of fermions are extremely small .",
    "this makes it charming to investigate new complex phases by considering the physics beyond the sm .",
    "the model iii version of the 2hdm is one of the candidate since the fc neutral currents ( fcnc ) are permitted at tree level and the new yukawa couplings can be complex in general . with",
    "the addition of spatial extra dimensions which are felt by the new higgs doublet there appear additional contributions sensitive to the compactification scale @xmath16 where @xmath23 is the radius of the compactification .",
