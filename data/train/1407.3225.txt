    "in almost any experiment and application of interacting many - body quantum systems only a small number of degrees of freedom can be controlled and manipulated while the rest remains experimentally inaccessible .",
    "the theory of open quantum systems @xcite provides a different view on this fact : the controllable quantities define an open system whose dynamics is substantially affected by the inaccessible degrees of freedom constituting the environment .",
    "the environmental properties are thus imprinted on the dynamics of the open system to a certain degree making the open system a quantum probe for the environment .",
    "recently , the use of quantum probes has been demonstrated experimentally ranging from all - optical setups @xcite to quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , several theoretical studies have shown quantum probing strategies in various other quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the extraction of information about the complex environment employing a quantum probe is frequently connected to non - markovian dynamics using the concept of the information flux between the open system and its environment @xcite .",

    "several experiments @xcite have been performed quantifying non - markovian behavior in terms of the flow of information between the open system and its environment .",
    "apart from long - lasting , non - negligible system - environment correlations inducing memory effects , it has been shown theoretically as well as experimentally that they can also be caused by nonlocal environmental correlations @xcite .",
    "the first model studied in ref.@xcite illustrates this effect by means of an open system consisting of two qubits coupled locally to a multimode field in a nonlocally correlated initial state . here",
    ", we consider this model with independently switchable interactions , which is inspired by the idea of having controllable quantum sensors probing the system of interest , and provide the correct expressions for the quantum dynamical map for environmental states given by a product of two - mode gaussian states",
    ". for suitably adjusted parameters and consecutively applied interactions , there are almost perfectly reviving nonlocal coherences identifying nonlocal memory effects .",
    "we then demonstrate how these nonlocal memory effects are influenced by the properties of the environmental multimode field imprinting unique signatures on the dynamics of the open system .",
    "it can be shown that the strength of the renascent coherences , corresponding to the recovery of entanglement of maximally entangled two - qubit bell states , is unambiguously connected to the squeezing in two - mode gaussian states as a function of the interaction length of the subsequently applied local interactions . by monitoring",
    "the rephasing of the nonlocal coherences for various time durations of the interaction one is able to reveal the squeezing of the multimode field .",
    "as the rephasing is inherently linked to a backflow of information the dynamics of the open system thus provides a non - markovian dynamical quantum probe for these environmental properties .",
    "we finally demonstrate that entanglement is not necessary for the occurrence of perfectly reviving nonlocal coherences by considering nonentangled , mixed two - mode gaussian states showing even stronger memory effects . by means of an approximated dynamics , neglecting the free evolution , an explanation for the phenomenon of nonlocal memory effects along with a necessary and sufficient condition for the properties of the two - mode gaussian states for sufficiently short interactions is provided by linking it to the magnitude of the correlation coefficient of the environmental coupling operators .",
    "we investigate the model of two two - level systems coupled to a bosonic environment which was studied previously regarding the occurrence of nonlocal memory effects @xcite .",

    "this function solely depends on the entries @xmath114 of the covariance matrix , so that the revival of the coherences mainly depends , apart from the squeezing parameter , on the sum @xmath178 of the mean photon numbers . however , as the local factors @xmath172 and @xmath173 also enter the definition of the nonlocal coherence factors , they are also affected by the quantities @xmath112 and @xmath113 of the covariance matrix resulting in unique open system dynamics pertaining to the chosen parameters . due to the parity of @xmath179 and @xmath180 , changing the sign of the squeezing parameter amounts to replacing @xmath177 by @xmath181 , thus , transforming @xmath182 into @xmath175 , and vice versa .",

    "for example for @xmath125 , after a complete decay , the modulus of the coherence factor @xmath152 revives substantially within the second period of interaction before attaining its constant value of about @xmath170 after the second interaction has terminated .",
    "the non - markovianity quantified by @xmath150 obtained for this choice of the parameters is about @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , for a larger squeezing and a shorter interaction length , the effect is amplified yielding a completely decaying and subsequently reviving nonlocal coherence factor .",
    "corresponding to the maximal increase of @xmath175 for @xmath160 as a function of the interaction length @xmath183 .",

    "one sees that there exists an optimal duration of the subsequent interactions with respect to maximally reviving nonlocal coherences for a given value of the squeezing parameter @xmath124 .",
    "the same observation can be made for truly thermal states where @xmath184 for @xmath4 . here , we concentrate on squeezed thermal states with equal mean photon numbers , i.e. @xmath185 , as the dynamics of the nonlocal coherence factors is mainly affected by the sum of the mean photon numbers .",
    "fig.[fig : optimal ] shows the optimal interaction length inducing maximal non - markovian behavior measured by @xmath150 for several squeezing parameters and summed mean photon numbers .",
    "again , the stronger the squeezing for a given mean photon number @xmath186 the shorter must be the subsequently applied interactions to obtain a substantially reviving nonlocal coherence factor @xmath152 .",

    "the effect of an increasing mean photon number on the optimal duration for a given squeezing can be seen in fig.[fig : optimal](b ) .",

    "[ fig : optimal](a ) , one recognizes that the maximal non - markovianity occurring for the optimally lasting local interactions is uniquely connected to the squeezing parameter for any fixed summed mean photon number .",
    "thus , by means of the non - markovianity of the two locally interacting two - level systems one can determine the squeezing parameter for a fixed and known temperature of the local environments . in this way",
    "the two - level systems represent a non - markovian dynamical quantum probe for this environmental property .",
    "an experimental implementation of this novel probing scheme requires knowledge about the mean photon numbers and to have full control over two two - level systems .",
    "this means that one must be able to prepare the system in the maximally entangled bell states which then have to be made interacting locally with the multimode field for different times . for any duration of the interactions one must only compare the outcomes of the state tomography after the first and the second local interaction in order to determine the non - markovianity induced by the squeezing .",
    "hence , the scheme requires a reliable preparation of identical environmental states characterized by the squeezing parameter and mean photon numbers . we want to point out that the probing scheme is stable against an imperfect realization of equally lasting and successive local interactions .",
    "these imperfections solely diminish the rephasing of the bell states leaving the unambiguous connection untouched which is at the heart of this strategy .",
    "a possible application of this scheme is to determine the squeezing of photon pairs generated by parametric down - conversion by means of the dynamics of the polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , for a highly accurate experiment , it is even possible to determine the small differences in the open system dynamics caused by different mean photon numbers @xmath120 and @xmath121 which thus permits to assign not only the squeezing parameter but also the mean photon numbers to the dynamics of the bell state .",
