    "experiments@xcite  have shown that , when placed in a perpendicular magnetic field , a graphene bilayer supports a set of landau levels with energies given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 all levels except @xmath0 are fourfold degenerate in addition to the usual degeneracy related to the guiding center coordinate .",
    "an electronic state is thus specified by its landau level index @xmath5 its guiding center index @xmath6 ( in the landau gauge ) , its spin index @xmath7 and its valley index @xmath8 in @xmath9 we must add an additional _ _  orbital _ _ index because states with both @xmath10 and @xmath11 landau - level character have zero kinetic energy .",
    "the eightfold degeneracy of the @xmath0 landau level is revealed experimentally by a jump in the quantized hall conductivity from @xmath12 to @xmath13 when the charge density is tuned across neutrality in moderately disordered samples@xcite .",
    "some of us@xcite have shown that the close proximity between the two graphene layers in bilayer graphene leads to spontaneous interlayer coherence in @xmath0 when coulomb interaction is taken into account . in a pseudospin language where the spin , layer and orbital degrees of freedom are each mapped to a @xmath14 pseudospin ( @xmath15 electron - electron interactions at integer filling factors completely lifts the degeneracy of the bilayer octet producing spontaneously broken - symmetry ground states with spin , valley and orbital polarizations . in consequence ,",

    "the possibility to study novel broken - symmetry ( bs )  states is always exciting and the new bs states in bilayer graphene are no exceptions . for example , the interlayer - coherent state at @xmath16 ( and @xmath20 if the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) can be considered as fully spin polarized ) is a quantum hall layer - pseudospin ferromagnet with pseudospin wave dispersion @xmath21 that contrasts with the usual linear dispersion found in interlayer - coherent states in semiconductor double - quantum - well systems .",

    "the orbital pseudospin mode corresponding to the collective motion of these dipoles is gapless despite the finite bias .",
    "it is a goldstone mode due to the breaking of the @xmath26 symmetry of the pseudospins in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "it was shown recently@xcite that there exists a dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction between the orbital pseudospins at @xmath27 that causes the orbital pseudospin mode to soften at a finite wave vector @xmath28 as the bias @xmath24 is increased .",

    "the effective pseudospin hamiltonian of the orbital states in a graphene bilayer is quite complex . since charge and pseudospin",
    "are coupled , a pseudospin texture such as that found in the orbital skyrmion crystal produces a charge density in real space and so the direct ( or hartree ) coulomb interaction must be considered together with the other competing interactions mentionned above .    in this work",
    ", we study in detail the helical and skyrmion crystal states .",
    "we derive their electronic properties as well as their collective excitations and compute their electromagnetic absorption .",
    "we show that the effective pseudospin model that describes these states involves nonlocal as well as anisotropic exchange interactions between the pseudospins .",
    "these coulomb exchange interaction tend to align the orbital pseudospins while the dm term favors a rotation of the pseudospins in space .",
    "the resulting ground states result from a balance between these competing forces just as in helical magnets such as mnsi and fe@xmath32co@xmath33si .",
    "one major difference in the graphene bilayer is that the dm interaction in the orbitally coherent state is of an entirely different origin than the spin - orbit interaction at work in usual helical magnets@xcite .",

    "interlayer coherence is present in the ground state at all integer filling factors but there is no orbital or spin coherence .",

    "an exhaustive study of the phase diagram for uniform states at all integer filling factors @xmath1 $ ] will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "we want to mention here , however , some changes that occur in the phase diagram .",
    "first of all , we remark that orbital coherence is driven by the @xmath107 term in eq .",
    "( [ s10 ] ) .",
    "together with the term @xmath108 they lift the degeneracy between levels @xmath10 and @xmath30the ordering of the non - iteracting levels is then as illustrated in fig .",

    "now , because of the better exchange interaction in @xmath114 the eigenstates in @xmath61 are bonding and anti - bonding states of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the electrons mostly in @xmath10 at low bias and mostly in @xmath11 at large bias .",
    "this produces an orbital coherent state .    if @xmath115 , we see from eq .",
    "( [ s10 ] ) that the only effect is to push the orbital coherent states to higher bias . in itself",

    "are shifted upward(downward ) in energy .",
    "when levels with different spins cross , states with spin coherence ( @xmath25 spin qhf ) become possible and they may replace the orbital state in the phase diagram . whether this is the case or not must be decided by numerical calculations . for @xmath119",
    "a numerical calculation@xcite shows that the orbital coherent state is absent for @xmath113 .",
    "we remark , however , that the exact value of @xmath48 is not precisely known and than orbital coherence does occur at smaller values of this parameter .",
    "fortunately , the phase diagram for the eight - level system is very rich and numerical calculations@xcite show that orbital coherence with no interlayer or spin coherences occurs in some range of bias but at the higher filling factors @xmath20 and @xmath120 and even when @xmath48 is as large as @xmath121 and spin mixing is considered .",
    "since we are confident that orbital coherent states do occur in the phase diagram in bilayer graphene , we will study , in this paper , the simplest case with @xmath122,@xmath123 and complete spin polarization .",
    "our results should apply with some minor changes to the orbital states at @xmath20 and @xmath124    in concluding this section , we remark that the phase diagram for filling factors @xmath113 has been studied in some details before @xcite,@xcite but only the homogeneous states have been considered .",

    "our calculations are all done at zero temperature .      with the restrictions outlined above , the analysis is reduced to that of a two - level system in valley @xmath61 since the two filled levels in valley @xmath111 can be considered as inert .",

    "<S> the two - dimensional electron gas in a bilayer graphene in the bernal stacking supports a variety of uniform broken - symmetry ground states in landau level @xmath0 at integer filling factors @xmath1 .$ ] when an electric potential difference ( or bias ) is applied between the layers at filling factors @xmath2 , the ground state evolves from an interlayer coherent state at small bias to a state with orbital coherence at higher bias where _ electric _ dipoles associated with the orbital pseudospins order spontaneously in the plane of the layers . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that by further increasing the bias at these two filling factors , the two - dimensional electron gas goes first through a skyrmion crystal state and then into an helical state where the pseudospins rotate in space . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudospin textures in both the skyrmion and helical states are due to the presence of a dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction in the effective pseudospin hamiltonian when orbital coherence is present in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the electronic structure of the helical and skyrmion crystal states as well as their collective excitations and then compute their electromagnetic absorption . </S>"
