    "as in ordinary geometry , we consider the tropical semimodule @xmath5 , as well as the corresponding tropical projective space @xmath6 given by modding out by tropical scalar multiplication .",
    "there has been a recent spate of work in tropical geometry , as well as the use of tropical geometry to solve problems arising in ordinary geometry . in particular , theories of tropical convexity  @xcite , tropical polytopes  @xcite , tropical linear spaces  @xcite , tropical linear algebra  @xcite , tropical geometry  @xcite , and tropical algebraic geometry  @xcite have all been burgeoning .    in this paper , we consider the _ k - th tropical secant variety _ of an ordinary linear subspace @xmath7 in tropical projective space @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 these tropical secant varieties correspond to the log - limits of ordinary toric varieties . to be precise ,",
    "the image of an ordinary toric variety in the variables @xmath10 under the logarithm map is a linear space in the variables @xmath11 ; the dimension of the linear space is the same as the dimension of the toric variety . for @xmath12 and @xmath13 large",
    ", we have @xmath14 , and so the log - limit of the ordinary secant variety corresponds to the tropical secant variety ( the max - plus and min - plus semirings are isomorphic . )",
    "another application of tropical secant varieties of linear subspaces is to the barvinok subcomplex .",
    "a matrix of size @xmath15 has _ barvinok rank _ at most @xmath16 if it is expressible as the tropical sum of @xmath16 tropically rank - one matrices , where a tropically rank - one matrix @xmath17 is one satisfying @xmath18 for all @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "these tropically rank - one matrices form an ordinary linear subspace , and the matrices of barvinok rank at most @xmath16 comprise the @xmath16-th secant variety of this linear subspace .",
    "a consequence of our work is that the interesting component of this space is a subcomplex of the secondary polytope of the product of simplices @xmath20 ; we also use our results to provide an intuitive algorithm for determining barvinok rank .",
    "our aim is to develop a general theory of these tropical secant varieties of ordinary linear spaces . in section  [ maintheorem ] ,",

    "a corollary of this is that the complex of matrices of barvinok rank two is pure .",
    "[ maintheorem ]    in this section , we prove the following main theorem allowing us to express tropical secant varieties of linear spaces as subcomplexes of the fan of regular subdivisions of an associated point configuration .",
    "[ thm - main ] let @xmath24 be the ( ordinary ) linear subspace of dimension @xmath21 generated by the @xmath21 rows of the associated matrix @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the @xmath27-point configuration in @xmath28 given by the columns of @xmath25 .",
    "then a vector @xmath29 is in the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety of @xmath7 if and only if the upper envelope of the polytope formed by the height vector @xmath30 has @xmath31 facets whose union contains each point of @xmath32 .",

    "consider any point @xmath38 .",
    "this is some linear combination of the rows of @xmath7 , plus a constant : @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding height function on the points @xmath40 is given simply by @xmath41 ; in other words , the heights given by @xmath42 to @xmath32 are given by the value of some affine functional on @xmath28 at those points .",
    "therefore , a point @xmath30 is in the @xmath16-th secant variety if there exist @xmath31 affine functionals on @xmath28 whose pointwise minima at the points of @xmath32 give the coordinates of @xmath30 .",
    "now , consider the regular subdivision of @xmath32 given by the upper envelope of the height vector @xmath30 as in the statement of the theorem .",
    "if these @xmath31 affine functionals exist , then each one defines an upper face of this polytope , since for each functional @xmath43 and each point @xmath40 we have @xmath44 ( since @xmath12 is the coordinate - wise minimum of the @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , for each @xmath40 , @xmath12 is equal to some @xmath45 , and so @xmath40 is in the face defined by @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , these faces together contain each point of @xmath32 , and thus so do a set of @xmath31 facets containing them .",
    "conversely , suppose that the height vector @xmath30 induces a regular subdivision with @xmath31 upper facets @xmath46 such that each @xmath40 is contained in one of them .",
    "each facet @xmath47 is contained in some hyperplane @xmath48 in the lifted @xmath28 with height vectors , and as before this hyperplane corresponds to an affine functional on @xmath28 .",
    "if this functional is @xmath49 , then define the point @xmath42 via @xmath39 .",
    "we claim that @xmath50 . we need to check that they agree in each coordinate , which is the same thing as saying that the height vector @xmath30 is the coordinate - wise minimum of the height vectors @xmath42 .",
    "however , since @xmath47 is an upper facet for each @xmath51 , for each @xmath52 we have @xmath53 , and since @xmath12 is contained in one of the facets , equality is achieved for some @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath30 is in the @xmath16-th secant variety of @xmath7 as desired .",
    "it is worth noting here that we picked an arbitrary basis for @xmath7 .",
    "however , picking a different basis yields an affinely isomorphic point configuration , so as must be the case we can pick any basis to fill out the matrix @xmath25 .",
    "since each regular subdivision corresponds to a polyhedral cone of height vectors , theorem  [ thm - main ] gives us a decomposition of the tropical secant variety .",
    "[ complex ] the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety of a linear subspace @xmath7 is a cone from @xmath7 over a polytopal complex , which we call the _ k - th tropical secant complex _ of @xmath7 .",
    "the faces of this polytopal complex correspond to regular subdivisions of @xmath7 in which there exist @xmath31 facets containing all of the points , with a face @xmath54 containing a face @xmath55 if the regular subdivision associated to @xmath54 refines the one associated to @xmath55 .",
    "first of all , consider the case of a regular subdivision not using all of the vertices of the point configuration . in order for a height vector to be valid under theorem  [ thm - main ] ,",
    "the lift of any unused point @xmath30 must lie on the lifted face whose interior contains @xmath30 , and in particular the height of @xmath30 is uniquely specified by the vertices of the point configuration , with the space of height vectors inducing that regular subdivision being affinely isomorphic to the space of height vectors on the used vertices inducing the regular subdivision on that point subconfiguration .",
    "this space is clearly a polyhedral cone , with inequalities on the heights given by the set of upper facets ; in other words , the inequalities are given by picking a vertex , picking an upper facet , and noting that the point s height must be less than that of the corresponding facet - defining hyperplane .",
    "setting one of these inequalities to an equality corresponds to the case where a point off a facet is moved onto the facet , which has the effect of coarsening the regular subdivision , so these cones fit together as stated in the corollary .",
    "the original cone is in the @xmath16-th secant variety if and only if the corresponding regular subdivision has @xmath31 facets whose union is all of the points ; this property is preserved under coarsening , so every face of any cone in the @xmath16-th secant variety is also in the @xmath16-th secant variety .",
    "therefore , the @xmath16-th secant variety is a valid polyhedral complex .    to check that it is a cone from @xmath7 over a polytopal complex",
    ", we need first to check for each cone that if @xmath56 , then @xmath30 is a cone point .",
    "however , as before , the height vector of @xmath56 is simply an affine functional on the space containing the configuration @xmath32 . taking a nontrivial linear combination of @xmath30 with",
    "any height vector @xmath57 simply performs an affine transformation on the heights , which does not change the induced regular subdivision and thus does not change the cone of the height vector as desired .",
    "the other step in checking that each cone is a cone from @xmath7 of a polytope is to check that the only lineality in each cone is in fact @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , consider any vector @xmath58 . because @xmath57 is not in @xmath7 , it is not an affine function on the configuration @xmath32 , so @xmath57 does not induce the trivial subdivision .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath57 and @xmath59 induce different subdivisions , indeed subdivisions with no common refinement . but given any @xmath30 in the cone , for large enough @xmath16 , @xmath60 refines @xmath57 and @xmath61 refines @xmath59 , so it is impossible that these two are the same regular subdivision , and hence they can not both be in the original cone .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 can not be in the lineality space of the cone as desired .    in the convex case",
    ", this gives us something very akin to the secondary polytope .",
    "given a polytope @xmath62 , the _ secondary polytope _",
    "@xcite is a polytope whose face poset is the poset of regular subdivisions , ordered by refinement , so that the vertices of @xmath62 are the regular triangulations .",
    "if @xmath32 is in convex position , and @xmath16 is large , all regular subdivisions satisfy the condition of corollary  [ complex ] .",
    "the condition for face inclusion is dual to the inclusion in the secondary polytope , so the @xmath16-th secant variety is a cone from @xmath7 over the dual of the secondary polytope . in particular",
    ", it will be all of @xmath63 in this case .",
    "indeed , this is an if and only if .",
    "the @xmath64-th secant variety of a linear subspace @xmath7 is all of @xmath63 if and only if the corresponding point configuration @xmath65 is in convex position , i.e. if every point of @xmath32 is a vertex of @xmath66 .",
    "a point @xmath30 is in the @xmath64-th secant variety if and only if its height vector corresponds to a lift of @xmath32 where the union of all of the upper facets contains all of the lifted points .",
    "if @xmath32 is in convex position , every height vector will have this property , since every point will be in some upper facet . if not , then some point can be written as an affine combination of the other points , @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "then if @xmath69 , the lifted point @xmath40 will not be in the upper envelope of the convex hull of all of the lifted points , and so it will be in no upper facet . therefore , any @xmath30 satisfying this condition will not be in the @xmath64-th secant variety of @xmath7 .    we can easily compute the dimension of the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety in the case where the linear subspace is _ generic _ in the sense that the point configuration @xmath32 is in general position , i.e. has no @xmath70 points lying in an affine subspace of dimension @xmath71 .",
    "[ cxdim ] suppose that the @xmath21-dimensional linear subspace @xmath7 is generic .",
    "then the @xmath16-th secant variety of @xmath7 is a complex of dimension @xmath72 .    by corollary  [ complex ] ,",
    "the faces of the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety of @xmath30 correspond to regular subdivisions of the @xmath73-point configuration @xmath32 in @xmath28 in which there exist @xmath31 facets whose union contains all of the points .",
    "the condition of the theorem implies that @xmath32 consists of @xmath73 distinct points . since the tropical secant variety is a subset of @xmath74 , it obviously must have dimension at most @xmath27 .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath75 .",
    "pick a generic linear functional ; this orders the points in @xmath32 in some order , @xmath76 .",
    "then by examining the values of this linear functional at these points , it is evident that the @xmath21-polytopes formed by the convex hulls of the sets @xmath77 do not intersect .",
    "these are @xmath16 @xmath21-simplices and one facet which is not a simplex ( they have dimension @xmath21 since the point configuration @xmath32 is in general position . )",
    "since these facets do not intersect , there exists a regular subdivision containing all of them .",
    "take a regular subdivision from this nonempty set which is as fine as possible .",
    "we claim that the corresponding cell of the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety has dimension @xmath78 . indeed , consider a height vector in its relative interior . for each of the @xmath31 @xmath21-polytopes in our set",
    ", we have @xmath70 degrees of freedom for the heights corresponding to those vertices , which gives us @xmath79 degrees of freedom which we can move in without changing the subdivision .",
    "furthermore , in the relative interior of this cell , wiggling these points can only refine the rest of the induced subdivision , and since the cell was chosen to be maximal with respect to refinement , it also leaves the remainder of the subdivision fixed .",
    "therefore , the cell of height vectors has dimension equal to @xmath79 , which upon projectivization yields a cell of dimension @xmath78 in the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety .",
    "on the other hand , any cell of the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety corresponds to a regular subdivision with @xmath31 facets whose union is all of @xmath32 .",
    "each of these facets is @xmath21-dimensional , and so in order for a height vector to be in this cell , the coordinates of the height vector which correspond to each facet must lie in a @xmath70-dimensional space . since each coordinate corresponds to at least one facet ,",
    "we have at most @xmath79 degrees of freedom in the cell , and so the maximal dimension of any cell in the tropical secant variety is in fact @xmath78 as desired .",
    "finally , suppose @xmath80 .",
    "we need to prove that there exists some cell of dimension @xmath27 in the @xmath16-th tropical secant variety of @xmath7 . as before ,",
    "we find a linear functional , which orders the points @xmath76 .",
    "for our ( at most ) @xmath31 facets , we take as many @xmath70 s as possible , until we are left with some remainder less than @xmath70 ; for the final facet , we take a simplex including this leftover subset and some points from the last set of @xmath70 , and as in the first case we find a triangulation including these facets and as fine as possible given that constraint . then by the same logic as before , it immediately follows that we have @xmath27 degrees of freedom which we can move in without changing the subdivision in question .",
    "this maximal dimension is what one would expect ; given some generic @xmath21-dimensional shape in ordinary space , the @xmath16-th secant variety consists of the union of all points in @xmath16-planes spanned by @xmath31 points from the shape .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom of this space should be as follows : for each of the @xmath31 points , we have @xmath21 degrees of freedom , and we have a final @xmath16 degrees of freedom for picking the point once the plane is fixed , for a total of @xmath81 , just as in the tropical secant case .",
    "the first tropical secant variety is especially nice .",
    "[ first - pure ] if the @xmath21-dimensional linear space @xmath7 is generic , then the first tropical secant variety of @xmath7 is a pure complex .    by proposition  [ cxdim ] ,",
    "the dimension of the first tropical secant variety of @xmath7 is @xmath82 .",
    "we need to show that every regular subdivision which contains two facets whose union contains each point in @xmath32 can be refined to one with this many degrees of freedom .",
    "first , suppose @xmath83 .",
    "if our two facets do not intersect , then as in the proof of the previous proposition , we take a regular subdivision containing the provided one which is as fine as possible .",
    "the corresponding cell will then have @xmath70 degrees of freedom for each facet for a total of @xmath84 ( after projectivization . )    if the two facets do not intersect , by the previous case , it suffices to show that this complex can be refined to one with two non - intersecting spanning facets .",
    "suppose they intersect in an @xmath85-face ; we will induct on @xmath85 . since @xmath32 is in general position",
    ", this face must be a simplex with @xmath86 points .",
    "since @xmath87 , and we have @xmath88 points with multiplicity , one of the two facets must have at least @xmath89 points .",
    "take one overlap point out of it ; the remaining points form a full - dimensional convex hull .",
    "then we can refine the previous subdivision by breaking this facet ; rigorously , what we are doing is lowering the height of the shared vertex by an infinitesimal amount and adjusting the heights of facet @xmath90 so that the lifted points still share a hyperplane .",
    "this process has the effect of taking the shared vertex out of the upper facet - defining hyperplane of @xmath91 ; the new , refined subdivision ( which may be strictly finer in other places as well ) refines the original one and has two facets whose union is all of @xmath32 overlapping in a face of smaller dimension . by induction , we are finished .",
    "next , suppose @xmath92 .",
    "we need to check that every valid regular subdivision can be refined to one whose cell has dimension @xmath27 .",
    "if the two spanning facets are both simplices , then we can refine this regular subdivision to a regular triangulation , whose cell has @xmath27 degrees of freedom . if not , then as in the first case we can remove one of the overlap points from one facet , eventually reducing to the case where both facets are simplices .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition .    however , the second tropical secant variety ( or complex ) is not pure even for points in general position , and the first tropical secant variety is not pure if we do not assume that the points are in general position",
    ". we will give examples of these deviant cases , as well as an example of a non - generic linear subspace where the dimension is wrong , in section  [ examples ] .",
    "in this section , we apply the results of section  [ maintheorem ] to the one - dimensional case , i.e. when @xmath7 is a line in @xmath74 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of a ( projective ) toric curve in @xmath27-space . in this case",
    ", we can completely compute the @xmath16-th tropical secant complex .",
    "let @xmath7 be a line in @xmath74 , generated by @xmath93 .",
    "then the @xmath16-th secant complex of @xmath7 consists of the set of lower faces of the cyclic polytope @xmath94 ( i.e. @xmath95 points in dimension @xmath96 ) , where @xmath21 is the number of distinct elements of @xmath97 .    the corresponding point configuration @xmath32 is @xmath73 points on the real line , located at @xmath98 ; we are looking for the space of height vectors @xmath99 such that the points @xmath100 have @xmath16 facets in their upper envelope which together contain all the points . to begin with ,",
    "if any @xmath101 and @xmath102 are identical , then the corresponding @xmath12 and @xmath103 must also be , as otherwise whichever is lower will have that point not be in the upper envelope at all .",
    "this reduces us to the case where the @xmath101 are distinct .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath104 .",
    "construction of bar patterns from height vectors of a one - dimensional point configuration . ]    a height vector @xmath99 is completely determined by the value of @xmath105 and the slopes @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "the condition that all of the points be in the upper envelope reduces to the constraint @xmath108 for @xmath109 . when @xmath110 , the points @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 are all in the same facet of the corresponding regular triangulation .",
    "we represent the @xmath27 slopes by points , putting a bar between two points if the corresponding slopes differ ; see figure  [ 1-cyclic ] for the corresponding illustration .",
    "it is plain to see that the vertices of the complex provided by corollary  [ complex ] ( for any @xmath16 ) , which are the coarsest nontrivial regular subdivisions , correspond to patterns with just one bar , of which there are @xmath114 .    therefore , to compute the complex of the @xmath16-th secant variety",
    ", it suffices to compute the finest regular subdivisions with @xmath31 facets whose union is all of the points .",
    "the @xmath73 lifted points are represented by the @xmath73 spaces in between the dots ( counting the beginning and the end ) , and the facets of a lifted configuration are given by the closed intervals between adjacent bars .",
    "suppose we have a bar pattern which is part of the @xmath16-th secant variety .",
    "the @xmath31 facets given by theorem  [ thm - main ] clearly must contain the interval from the first space to the first bar .",
    "if the space following the first bar is not filled by a bar , then in order for the union of these facets to contain this space , we must also take the facet consisting of the interval from the first bar to the second bar .",
    "if this is the case , then we can insert a bar in the space following the first bar , and take the shortened facet from the new bar to the old second bar along with the other @xmath16 original facets ; we have just demonstrated that this augmented bar pattern still has the property .",
    "therefore , any bar pattern which corresponds to a facet of the tropical secant complex must have its first two bars adjacent . by identical reasoning",
    ", it in fact follows that the bars must come in adjacent pairs ; the facets we take consist of every other interval , including the first and last .",
    "counting carefully , we conclude that there must be @xmath16 pairs of consecutive bars or @xmath96 bars in all .",
    "so , the condition to be a facet of the tropical secant complex is that the included points must come in consecutive pairs .",
    "this is precisely the same as gale s evenness condition  @xcite for being a facet of the cyclic polytope @xmath115 , except that our condition has the added stipulation that the initial and final segments of bars must have even length .",
    "this stipulation is easily seen to correspond exactly to the statement that the facet in question is a lower one , and so the @xmath16-th tropical secant complex is ( combinatorially ) isomorphic to the complex of lower faces of the cyclic polytope @xmath115 as desired .    in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the @xmath16-th tropical secant complex is the same regardless of the ( generic ) linear subspace chosen ; this is because the oriented matroid of any @xmath27-point configuration in general position is the same , and so the space of regular triangulations of these configurations are all combinatorially isomorphic . in the two - dimensional case ,",
    "corresponding to toric surfaces , the oriented matroid statement is of course no longer true , and this leads to a wide variety of behavior of these tropical secant varieties .",
    "we investigate this behavior in the next section .",
    "in the previous section , we completely computed the tropical secant complexes of all one - dimensional linear subspaces . in particular , these @xmath16-th secant complexes were all pure and contractible . in this section ,",
    "we compute a variety of examples , in which we show that these phenomena were purely low - dimensional : even in two dimensions and even for @xmath116 , the phylum of tropical secant complexes is diverse , including species which are not pure and not contractible .",
    "we also demonstrate non - generic examples where the dimension of the tropical secant variety is not in accordance with proposition  [ cxdim ] . rather than give the details of all of the computations , we present diagrams of the complexes associated to various configurations ( with labeled vertices and facets ) as well as pointing out some relevant aspects .",

    "our first example is a point configuration in general , non - convex position : a square with two points inside it .",
    "the corresponding linear subspace is generated by the rows of the matrix with the points as its columns : @xmath118 this linear subspace , a two - dimensional linear subspace in @xmath119 , exhibits fairly normal behavior .",
    "its first secant variety is the right dimension ( five ) ; indeed , the first secant variety is equal to the @xmath16-th secant variety for all @xmath120 , since every regular subdivision of this point configuration has two facets whose union is the whole space ( one containing the left three points and one containing the right three points . )",
    "this first tropical secant complex is shown in figure  [ square - plus-2 ] .",
    "since the points are in general position , it is pure by proposition  [ first - pure ] , and it is also contractible .",

    "the first secant complex , however , is interesting : in particular , it is not contractible . for a general @xmath27-gon , the first secant complex s vertices will correspond to diagonals ; the facets ( it is a two - dimensional complex ) correspond to subdivisions given by three diagonals @xmath123 . for @xmath124 ,",

    "six of these have the property that they have two facets whose union contains all of the vertices ; these are the six facets in this first secant complex .",

    "it is topologically equivalent to a circle and is decidedly impure .",
    "we can achieve the same behavior in convex position in one higher dimension by taking a point configuration consisting of a cube with a point beyond a facet . the subdivision given by two opposite square pyramids including the extra point and",
    "a triangulation elsewhere is then a maximal face in the complex , but it has lower dimension than another face of the complex , namely the one consisting of the extra point and three points of the facet nearest it , the square pyramid formed by the other five points , and simplices to fill out the remainder of the cube .    in both the second and third examples , the property responsible for the impureness is an oriented matroid one . in the maximal secant",
    "complex face of inappropriate dimension , two facets of the spanning set overlap , and ordinarily ( if the points are in general position ) we are able to deal with this by removing a point from one of them , thus refining the subdivision",

    "however , this need not be the case , as the next example shows . here , the point configuration @xmath32 consists of one point off a line and five points on a line , corresponding to the linear subspace generated by the rows of @xmath130 proposition  [ cxdim ] tells us that the first tropical secant variety should have dimension @xmath131 .",
    "however , it has only dimension four : that is , the first tropical secant complex is one - dimensional , not two - dimensional .",
    "its vertices correspond to the coarsest possible nontrivial subdivisions , those with one dividing line segment ; there are no two - faces , which correspond to having three dividing line segments , since the only regular subdivision with three dividing line segments does not have two facets whose union is the whole space .",
    "the first tropical secant complex , which consists of two line segments intersecting at a single point , is shown in figure  [ five - on - a - line ] .",
    "this diversity among tropical secant varieties , even for first secant varieties of two - dimensional linear subspaces , is just a peek at the inviting theory .",
    "these complexes need not be pure , of the predicted dimension , or contractible . in the next section , we shift our focus to applying the theory to an already existing setup , namely the complex of matrices of fixed barvinok rank .",
    "the following definition ( taken from  @xcite ) is important in combinatorial optimization .",
    "a matrix has _",
    "barvinok rank _",
    "@xmath16 if it can be expressed as the tropical sum of @xmath16 matrices of tropical rank one , but not as the tropical sum of @xmath132 such matrices .",
    "a matrix @xmath17 has tropical rank one if we can write @xmath133 for some @xmath12 s and @xmath134 s .",
    "barvinok , johnson , and woeginger  @xcite showed that for matrices of fixed barvinok rank @xmath16 , the traveling salesman problem can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "thus , an algorithm for finding the barvinok rank of a matrix , or a description of the space of matrices of barvinok rank @xmath16 , is important .",
    "we have previously considered this problem in the papers  @xcite ( with bernd sturmfels and francisco santos ) and  @xcite .    using the terminology in this paper ,",
    "an attractive reformulation of the problem emerges .",
    "it is evident from the definition that a matrix @xmath135 has barvinok rank @xmath16 if it lies in the @xmath136-st secant variety of @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is the space consisting of all matrices of tropical rank one .",
    "this is a linear subspace in @xmath137 variables , defined by the equations @xmath138 .",
    "a basis for this linear subspace of @xmath139 is given by the matrices @xmath140 , where @xmath141 has 1 s in the @xmath52-th row and 0 s everywhere else , and @xmath142 has 1 s in the @xmath51-th column and 0 s everywhere else .",
    "the columns of the matrix with these rows are all 0 - 1 vectors with zero or one 1 s among the first @xmath21 coordinates , and zero or one 1 s among the last @xmath114 .",
    "this point configuration consists of the vertices of the product of simplices @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , to determine the barvinok rank of a matrix @xmath135 , it suffices to consider the regular triangulation induced by the corresponding height vector on @xmath144 , i.e. by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 $ ] and @xmath147 $ ] . the barvinok rank will be the smallest number of facets needed to cover all of the vertices of @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the complexes of barvinok rank @xmath148 are nested subcomplexes of the secondary polytope of @xmath62 .",
