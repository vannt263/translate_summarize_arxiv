    "the electrons , which are excited in the conduction band by light with photon energies @xmath13 exceeding the band gap @xmath14 , are thermalized to the band bottom , form a narrow energy distribution with the width of @xmath15 , diffuse towards the emitting surface , pass through the band bending region , and escape into vacuum .",

    "the electrons , which descend along the energy scale below the vacuum level during thermalization in the band bending region , recombine at the surface and do not contribute to the photoemission current .",

    ", in a semiconductor with the state of nea , the photoemission occurs via electron capture to a two - dimensional sub - band in the band bending region and subsequent elastic or inelastic tunneling into vacuum through the potential barrier formed by the ( cs , o ) layer .",
