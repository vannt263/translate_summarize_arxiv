    "this talk discusses some recent developments in the description of excited baryons via large @xmath0 qcd@xcite .",
    "the work discussed was principally done in collaboration with rich lebed of asu ; two students of mine , abhi nellore and dan dakin also made substantial contributions and dan martin , a student of rich lebed s , also contributed .",
    "this talk will be very light on the technical details .",
    "i refer you to the original papers for a more detailed description .",
    "to begin with let me motivate why one should look at large @xmath0 qcd in this context .",
    "the answer is quite simple .",
    "consider the three great lies :    * the check is in the mail .",
    "* of course , darling , i will respect you in the morning . *",
    "my model is based on qcd .",
    "the perspective of this talk is that the third one of these lies should be lumped with the first two .",
    "let us recall that the good book , a.k.a the particle data book @xcite , contains an immense amount of information about baryons .",
    "but there is no simple systematic way to compute the properties of these states directly from qcd .",
    "virtually all workers in the field use models and the constituent quark model is clearly the standard tool out there .",
    "however , as will be discussed below , the constituent quark model has many serious difficulties .",
    "thus it is very important to develop model - independent ways to learn what we can about these states even if these model - independent methods are highly limited .",
    "large @xmath0 qcd is such a model - independent tool .      the word `` quark '' has three meanings .",
    "* a nonsense word from james joyce s _ finnegan s wake _ : `` three quarks for muster mark . ''",
    "* a fundamental degree of freedom in qcd .",
    "* an effective degree of freedom in the quark model ( aliases : the constituent quark model , the naive quark model ... )    in many ways the last two are no more closely related than the first two .",
    "the constituent quark model has many problems . in the first place as given it yields stable excited states . to give resonance widths , additional and totally _ ad hoc _ dynamics are needed to describe coupling to mesons or quark - antiquark pairs . thus structure and dynamics",
    "are not treated on the same footing .",
    "this is highly problematic for descriptions of excited baryons which , after all , are resonances seen in scattering experiments .",
    "secondly , the connection to qcd is totally obscure .",
    "the qcd quarks are simply different beasts then constituent quarks .",
    "a qcd quark has a mass of @xmath1 5 mev ; a quark model quark has a mass @xmath1 300 mev .",
    "indeed , the role of the quark model in the history of physics is quite ironic .",
    "it played a truly essential role in the development of qcd but once qcd was discovered there was no know way to derive the quark model .",
    "despite these conceptual problems the naive quark model remains the standard picture with which most hadronic physicists think about states , particularly excited states .",
    "the reasons for this are clear : the quark model is easy to think about  it is patterned after well - understood atomic physics .",
    "direct qcd calculations for excited states using lattice techniques are extremely difficult and it will be a long while before reliable lattice studies are available . finally , the quark model works ... sort of .",
    "not all states are well described and some predicted states have not been observed .      the problem with qcd at low momentum qcd is the absence of a natural expansion parameter . in 1973 , just a year after the formalization of qcd , ",
    "t hooft proposed that qcd could be generalized from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and that @xmath4 can then serve as an expansion parameter@xcite .",
    "he developed a clever double line diagrammatic method following the color flow and showed that a formal limit exists in which @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 held fixed . in this",
    "expansion planar diagrams of gluons dominate with each nonplanar gluon costing a factor of @xmath8 and each quark loop counting a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "these diagrammatic rules have important implications for correlation functions for operators with the quantum numbers of mesons or glueballs and from these , @xmath0 scaling rules can be deduced .",
    "witten generalized the approach to include baryons by arguing that a mean - field picture becomes increasing well justified as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "formally this analysis yields , among other rules , the following @xmath0 scaling rules : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an n - meson vertex and @xmath13 is a coupling constant of a meson to a baryon",
    ".    there are important phenomenological consequences from these generic scaling rules which give a cartoon - like description of the real world :    * baryons are heavy compared to mesons .",
    "* mesons are weakly interacting among themselves .",
    "* baryons are strongly coupled to mesons but baryon - meson scattering is order unity .",
    "* ozi rule is qualitatively understood ( it becomes exact as @xmath10 ) .",
    "* dominance of two - meson decays when possible , * explains non - existence of @xmath14 exotics .",
    "( they can not bind at large @xmath0 ) .",
    "* domination of meson and glueball tree graphs in effective theory ; helps justify regge picture .",
    "* requires the existence of hybrid mesons ( _ e.g. , _ states with quantum numbers of a quark - antiquark and valence glue ) .",
    "@xcite      the large @xmath0 analysis discussed so far has been generic in the sense that the specific spin and flavor quantum numbers played no special role . as will be seen , for the case of baryons spin and flavor play an exceptionally important role .",
    "in particular , a contracted @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the number of degenerate light flavors ) emerges for baryons at large @xmath0 .",
    "this symmetry is closely related to the @xmath15 symmetry of the simplest version of the quark model .",
    "the key idea in the derivation of the symmetry is large @xmath0 consistency@xcite .",
    "suppose one were studying pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "the contribution from the direct and crossed born graphs are proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "all non - born graphs ( including the sum of iterated pion exchange ) according to witten s counting rules scales as @xmath18 , apparently yielding a scattering amplitude which scales as @xmath19 .",
    "however , this violates unitarity .",
    "the only way to make the counting consistent is if the born terms are canceled by other baryons ( _ e.g. , _ the @xmath20 ) which are degenerate with the nucleon ( for @xmath21 ) and for which there is a conspiracy in the coupling constants .",
    "such a structure is possible only if the vertices satisfy a set of commutation relations .",
    "it turns out that this set of commutation relations is the lie algebra of contracted @xmath15 .",
    "thus , this algebra , and its associated group , becomes exact in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "in this write - up , i will spare you details and refer you to the original papers .",
    "the key things i would like to stress , however , is that this group structure captures considerable dynamical information .",
    "the low - lying baryon states must fall into nearly degenerate multiplets corresponding to representations of the group .",
    "moreover , within the subspace of the states in a representation there is a wigner - eckert theorem at work so that _ all _ operators can be expressed as c - numbers ( _ i.e. _ reduced matrix elements ) times matrix elements of generators which can be determined entirely from group theoretic considerations .",
    "corrections to this must be of relative order @xmath4 or smaller .",
    "now as it happens all the representations of this contracted group are infinite dimensional .",
    "the lowest - lying members of the representation are physical and the higher lying states are seen as large @xmath0 artifacts .",
    "the usual nucleon and @xmath20 are assumed to be in the lowest representation of the group  this is the _ only _ model dependence of the approach .",
    "now it turns out this representation `` looks like '' states in a naive quark model ( for large @xmath0 ) with all quarks in identical s - wave orbitals@xcite .",
    "they look like the quark model states in the sense that there is a one - to - one mapping between the states in the representation and states in the quark model with the same quantum numbers .    this lowest - lying representation is composed of states which have @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the isospin ) .",
    "the lowest two states are identified as the nucleon and @xmath20 .",
    "higher - lying states are seen as @xmath4 artifacts ; the nucleon-@xmath20 mass splitting goes like @xmath9 .",
    "the ratio of matrix elements of operators between different states in the representation are fixed by clebsch - gordan coefficients for the group up to corrections which vanish at large @xmath0 .",
    "for example , at large @xmath0 , @xmath24 . in nature , this relation holds to a few percent so the approach has real predictive power .",
    "( in fact this particular comparison works as well as it does in part because this particular relation is `` gold - plated '' in that it does not acquire any correction correction at order @xmath4@xcite .",
    "there is a technical trick introduced by dashen , jenkins and manohar to do the group theory simply@xcite .",
    "one can map the generators onto a quark model with all quarks in a single s - wave orbital with the generators given by : @xmath25 in the limit @xmath10 these generators reproduce the commutation relations of the algebra .",
    "thus , to calculate all of the relevant clebsches it is sufficient to compute the matrix elements in the quark model . it should be noted here that this does _ not _ mean the dynamics is that quark model  this is merely a `` poor man s '' way to do group theory .",
    "one key result of the group theory which will play a crucial role for the excited states is the @xmath22 rule .",
    "this rule states that all operators which contribute in leading order carry quantum numbers with @xmath22 .",
    "this rule was originally seen in the skyrme model@xcite but was subsequently derived directly from the group theory of large @xmath0 qcd@xcite .",
    "operators violating this rule are suppressed by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "at first sight it may seem straightforward to simply extend this analysis directly to excited baryons .",
    "if the states are fixed by symmetry and the symmetry can be simply encoded in a quark model basis it seems that one can simply create a large @xmath0 quark model and automatically get the large @xmath0 results .",
    "in fact , a number of papers have done just that@xcite .",
    "there are two conceptual problems associated with this , however .",
    "the first is that the derivation of the group theoretic result was only for the space states degenerate with the nucleon at large @xmath0 and these excited states are split from the nucleon by order @xmath18 .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ there is no direct justification for the group structure without redoing the large @xmath0 consistency argument .",
    "now as it happens pirjol and yan in a technical _ tour de force _ did precisely this and showed that a contracted @xmath15 structure arises for the excited states @xcite .    despite the beautiful mathematics of ref .",
    "@xcite it has an underlying conceptual problem : it is based on the scattering of pions off of asymptotic baryon states .",
    "however , the excited baryons are not generically stable asymptotic states even at large @xmath0 . as shown originally by witten the characteristic width of an excited baryon is @xmath18they do not become stable at large @xmath0@xcite .",
    "thus , it is not legitimate to do an analysis based on the assumption that the scattering amplitudes of a pion off of an excited baryon is well defined .",
    "this problem could be evaded at least for some class of states if there existed a class of states which for symmetry reasons has a width which goes like @xmath9 . now as it happens , in reference @xcite it is shown that in the context of a simple large @xmath0 quark model there are states with a width @xmath27 . however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is only an artifact of the simple quark model and is not a generic large @xmath0 result .",
    "thus the straightforward extension of the techniques for the ground band are not justified for excited states .      the key idea that rich lebed and i pursued to evade the difficulty that a straightforward extension of the techniques used for the ground band to excited states was to focus directly on physical observables rather than on particular baryon `` states '' .",
    "recall , that difficulty with focusing on particular excited baryon states is that they are resonances rather than stable states .",
    "moreover , as a practical experimental matter , the only way we know about these state is through scattering experiments .",
    "thus , our first goal is to use large @xmath0 methods to understand scattering . as a matter of principle",
    "we do not know directly from large @xmath0 methods whether qcd has any baryon resonances ( or more to the point , any baryon resonances which are narrow enough to observe even if we lived in a truly large @xmath0 world ) .",
    "however , if we are able to relate scattering amplitudes in different channels to each other at large @xmath0 , then we can conclude that if there is a pole in the scattering amplitude at complex energy_i.e .",
    ", _ a resonance  in one channel it will have a nearby partner in another .    to see how this works consider for simplicity the case of two - flavored qcd and focus on pion - baryon scattering where the baryon is a ground state baryon ( nucleon , @xmath20 ) .",
    "a generic scattering amplitude can be labeled @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the initial ( final ) pion orbital angular momentum , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the initial ( final ) spin and angular momentum of the baryon , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the total isospin and angular momentum in the s - channel .",
    "the key thing is that this amplitude is an operator in the space of baryons and , hence , at leading order satisfies the @xmath22 rule ( which as a scattering process is a t - channel variable ) .",
    "since general isospin and angular momentum allows more t - channel amplitudes than the @xmath22 rule does , at large @xmath0 qcd the various amplitudes are related . using standard recoupling identities to go from the t - channel to s - channel @xcite yields the following large @xmath0 result : @xmath35",
    "an analogous result can be derived for @xmath36 nucleon scattering . @xmath37",
    "the reason that various scattering amplitudes are linearly related is clear from the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ mpeqn1 ] ) and ( [ mpeqn2 ] ) : there are more amplitudes @xmath28 than there are @xmath38 amplitudes , and thus there are linear constraints between them that hold to leading order in the @xmath4 expansion ; similarly , there are more @xmath39 amplitudes than @xmath40 amplitudes .",
    "note that in both the @xmath41 and @xmath36 scattering cases there are `` reduced '' scattering amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath40 .",
    "both of these depend on a variable @xmath43 which is summed over in the final expression .",
    "as will be seen , this @xmath43 quantum can be used to distinguish resonances .    while these formulae are not new  they were previously derived in the context of the skyrme model@xcite  the present model - independent derivation is .",
    "one can algebraically eliminate the reduced matrix elements to obtain relations directly between the physical amplitudes which hold to leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "i will refer you to the original papers for an enumeration of all such relations and a test of how well they work . here for concreteness i focus on one particularly illuminating case of @xmath41-n scattering ( @xmath44 ) with @xmath45 ( f - waves ) .",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be denoted in the form @xmath46 @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the left and right sides of eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) are plotted for both the real and the imaginary parts of amplitudes extracted from the scattering data .",
    "it is easy to envision how the two sides can overlap exactly as @xmath10 .    ) with the left - hand side .",
    "the upper curve represents the real part while the lower curve represents the imaginary .",
    "the amplitudes are extracted from a partial wave extraction of the fit to scattering data @xcite . ]    apart from the fact that they demonstrate the predictive power of the method , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] also show how resonances are related .",
    "clearly there is a resonance in the f37 channel , since the left - hand side must equal the right - hand side up to @xmath4 corrections there clearly must also be a resonance in at least one of the channels on the right - hand side and that is exactly what we see .",
    "thus , although i have not shown from first principles that either channel needs to have a resonance , i have demonstrated that _ if _ there is a resonance in one channel there will be resonances in other channels which are degenerate up to @xmath4 corrections .    before completing a discussion of the degeneracy of resonances and the symmetries that it entails , it is useful to mention at this stage that the method can be generalized and extended .",
    "for example one can work at next to leading order ( which only has additional predictive power in the reaction @xmath48)@xcite or study @xmath36n scattering , photoprodction reactions@xcite or scattering in exotic ( pentaquark ) channels@xcite .",
    "a resonance is a pole in the scattering amplitude at unphysical kinematics .",
    "suppose for the sake of argument that eq .",
    "( [ mpeqn1 ] ) was exact ( @xmath4 corrections were negligible ) and that there was a resonance in a particular channel and , hence , a pole in the scattering amplitude at some unphysical point .",
    "such a divergence is only possible if one of the reduced amplitudes itself diverges .",
    "therefore , the existence of a resonance implies a pole in a reduced amplitude .",
    "however , a single reduced amplitude contributes to many physical amplitudes .",
    "thus the existence of a resonance in one channel in large @xmath0 qcd predicts the existence of a resonance in other channels .",
    "note that not only does this imply the existence of a resonance in the other channels but the existence of a resonance at the same unphysical value for the energy .",
    "this means that the resonances are degenerate : large @xmath0 qcd predicts the existence of degenerate multiplets of resonances .",
    "a few comments are in order about such multiplets .",
    "the first is that position of the resonances for these multiplets are degenerate in the complex plane : thus they are degenerate in both mass and width .",
    "this result needs to be taken with a grain of salt , however , due to @xmath4 corrections . while it is formally true at large @xmath0 that the widths and masses will be degenerate , one might expect that for the lowest - lying resonances of physical interest that there might be large @xmath4 corrections to the widths",
    "the reason for this is simply that for low - lying states the widths are highly sensitive to the available phase space , and small variations in the mass of state due to @xmath4 corrections can yield large differences in the widths .",
    "it is probably better to characterize the widths and coupling constants as being nearly degenerate at large but finite @xmath0 rather than the masses and the widths .",
    "note that these multiplets share a common @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are important in characterizing the incoming and outgoing channels while the @xmath43 quantum number really characterizes the intrinsic properties of the resonances .",
    "note the existence of degenerate multiplets of states is exactly what one expects if the states fall into representations of some group . in this sense",
    "the analysis above implies the existence of an emergent @xmath15 symmetry for the excited states at large @xmath0 as well as the ground states .",
    "this provides some _ a posteriori _ justification for the treatments of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the connection between this approach and the quark model based approach of refs . @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "as noted above , there is no real _ a priori _ justification for the approach . unlike the analysis of the ground band baryons , for excited baryons the quark model approach is more than just `` poor man s group theory '' ; it makes real dynamical assumptions including the assumption that the states are stable ( or at least narrow at large @xmath0 and that some fixed number of quarks are in excited orbitals ) . despite this",
    ", there is a strong connection between this approach and the model - independent method described above . in particular",
    ", the underlying group structure of the quark model implies that if one only includes the leading order operators in the @xmath4 expansion then the excitation energies in the quark model fall neatly into degenerate multiplets@xcite .",
    "this fact is not manifestly clear in the treatments of @xcite since subleading operators were included at the outset .",
    "moreover , the spin - flavor quantum numbers of these multiplets are in a one - to - one correspondence with those allowed for a particular @xmath43 multiplets resonant analysis above@xcite .",
    "thus , the quark model captures the multiplet structure of the underlying @xmath4 dynamics .      in the best of all possible worlds",
    ", one would see clear evidence for the large @xmath0 multiplet structure in the hadronic data with small splittings due to @xmath4 effects .",
    "alas , in this world things are not so nice .",
    "the difficulty is that splittings between multiplets are small compared to the splitting within each multiplet .",
    "the reason for this is unclear but is not connected with @xmath4 physics in any obvious way . to make sense of this situation more",
    "analysis is required . a better understanding of how higher - order effects enter is clearly needed and work along this direction is being pursued .",
    "another possible way to see effects is to broaden the analysis to three flavors and see if the effects of the multiplet structure are more apparent there .",
    "again , to do this , systematic higher - order corrections are necessary ( this time in @xmath2 flavor breaking ) .",
    "analysis of the @xmath2 generalization has begun@xcite .",
    "there is , however , one place where the large @xmath0 analysis has already borne phenomenological fruit and that is the study of _ decays _ of negative parity nucleon states .",
    "one puzzling aspect of these states is the fact that the n(1520 ) decays very strongly to the @xmath36n channel and comparatively weakly to the @xmath41n channel ( they have very similar branching fractions even though the phase space for @xmath49 is a factor of  3 greater ) while the n(1650 ) decays very strongly to the @xmath41n channel and very weakly to the @xmath36n channel .",
    "this can be easily understood from large @xmath0 .",
    "if one assumes that the states to good approximation fall into @xmath43 multiplets with small admixtures due to @xmath4 effects , then this behavior is quite natural .",
    "it is easy to see by tracking through the quantum numbers that a pure @xmath50 negative parity nucleon can not decay into @xmath51 and a pure @xmath52 negative parity nucleon can not decay into @xmath49 .",
    "thus if one identifies the n(1520 ) as ( predominantly ) a @xmath52 state and the n(1650 ) as ( predominantly ) a @xmath52 state , the decay patterns are easily understood .",
