    "the other states contained in @xmath120 can also be obtained easily according eq .",
    "( 16 ) .",
    "although all the pure states with the same entanglement is equivalent under local unitary operations , it can be seen from the above results that under decoherence the behavior of different pure states are not all the same .",
    "this reflect the properties of the decoherence model and its influence on the entanglement .",
    "our results suggest that if the decoherence model is fixed , there exists a special class of pure states , with the same initial entanglement , which are more favorable for maintaining entanglement .",
    "this gives some useful hints for maintaining and distributing entanglement .",
    "for example , if we want to distribute an entangled pure state between two separate parties through noisy channels , it will be helpful to apply some local unitary operations beforehand to transform the entangled pure state into the form of the states in the above set @xmath120 .",
    "for an initial general mixed entangled state @xmath0 with the initial entanglement @xmath118 , to drive an analytic evolution equation for its entanglement maybe intractable .",
    "however , we derive a upper bound of the residual entanglement in the following .",
    "this upper bound is the corresponding residual entanglement @xmath125 for the states in the set @xmath120 with the same initial entanglement @xmath118 .",
    "it has be shown in @xcite , there exists an optimal decomposition @xmath126 , such that @xmath127 for each @xmath128 , with @xmath129 . then under decoherence @xmath0 is transformed into another state @xmath130 .",

    "since @xmath132 , it is obvious that @xmath133 .",
    "this suggests that the state in the set @xmath120 is the most entanglement - stable of all the states with the same initial entanglement , no matter pure or general mixed states .",
    "it is well known that , an arbitrary pure state can be transformed into the states , with the same entanglement , of the set @xmath120 by local unitary operations .",
    "thus in the sense discussed in this paper , the pairwise entanglement in pure states are more favorable for maintaining entanglement compared to the generic mixed states .",
    "this conclusion is valid for any decoherence model which can be verified from the above discussions .",
    "up till now , we have investigate the entanglement dynamics of two - qubit states assuming that each qubit is independently coupled to the environment .",
    "in the following , we consider the situation that only one qubit is under decoherence and the initial state is a pure entangled state .",
    "we are interested in whether the lifetime of entanglement also depends on the initial entanglement in this situation .",
    "as discussed above , the entanglement dynamics for pure states with the same initial entanglement are also dependent on their forms .",
    "to be comparable , we set the initial pure state in the schmidt decomposition form @xmath134 . if only the first qubit is under decoherence , then the two - qubit system becomes @xmath135 .",

    "( 6 ) is the depolarizing channels .",
    "the depolarizing channels describe the system - environment coupling in the large temperature limit @xmath141 .",
    "it can be realized by random von neumann measurements .",
    "again we assume that each qubit is independently coupled to the environment .",
    "the shrinking coefficients are @xmath142 .",
    "taking into account of the strength of the system - environment coupling and the interaction time , we can write @xmath143 . thus the corresponding matrices in the @xmath10-picture are @xmath144 $ ] . given an arbitrary initial entangled pure state @xmath101 , the corresponding schmidt decomposition normal form is @xmath123 associated with the @xmath10-matrix @xmath73 . then after time @xmath145 , the residual entanglement is dependent on the @xmath146 .",
    "note that @xmath147 and @xmath148 here",
    ". therefore the concurrence at time @xmath145 is @xmath149    from the above evolution function of the pairwise entanglement , we can find that the residual entanglement at time @xmath145 , only depends on its initial entanglement @xmath118 .",
    "thus for all two - qubit pure states coupled with the same depolarizing environment , the stability of the entanglement is only governed by their initial entanglement , although these pure states could be in different forms .",
    "in other words , all pure states are the most entanglement - stable , need not to apply local unitary operations beforehand .",
    "recalling the above analysis in the @xmath10-picture , the reason for this interesting result is that the shrinking of the lorentz singular values of the associated @xmath10-matrix , which is introduced by the depolarizing channels , is isotropic . besides , it is also obviously that even for two generic mixed state , if there are @xmath150 equivalent then the dynamics of two - qubit entanglement are also equal . furthermore , there are some special mixed entangled states which have the same entanglement dynamics as pure states , that is also the most entanglement - stable .",
    "we will discuss the situation of mixed states in the next section . in fig .",
    "1 we present a visual example by plotting the dynamics of residual entanglement for pure states and some other generic mixed states with the same initial entanglement .",
    "residual entanglement @xmath151 as function of time @xmath145 .",

    "we consider the depolarizing channels , and the initial entangled state @xmath0 is a decoherence path state with the initial entanglement @xmath156 .",
    "thus there exists @xmath154 with the entanglement @xmath157 and some time @xmath158 that satisfy @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",

    "therefore in the depolarizing channels not only all pure states but also some special mixed states have the same entanglement dynamics .",
    "in other words , the pairwise entanglement of the decoherence path states are also the most stable .",
    "we plot the dynamics of entanglement in decoherence path states with different initial entanglement , as depicted in fig .",
    "2 .    from fig.2 ( a )",
    "it can be seen that the entanglement in the two - qubit system decreases with time due to its interaction with the decoherence environment .",
    "there exists some time @xmath164 when its entanglement @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
