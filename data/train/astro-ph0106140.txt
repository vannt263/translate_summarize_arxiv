    "unique in the galaxy , the rapid burster ( mxb 1730@xmath1335 , hereafter rb ) in the globular cluster liller 1 is the only low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) star system observed to emit both type  i and  ii x - ray bursts ( hoffman et al .",
    "often the rapid chains of bursts occur at intervals as short as 7  s , sometimes producing thousands of bursts per day .",
    "the burst flux is related to the time between bursts in a fashion reminiscent of a relaxation oscillator , strongly implying that the neutron star magnetic field acts as a reservoir which fills and empties , causing each burst .",
    "thus with this object we are directly observing the dynamic behavior of the intense magnetic field of a neutron star on a timescale of seconds .",
    "this activity only occurs during the outburst phase , which occurs every 6 - 8 months and lasts only a few weeks .",
    "the _ rossi _",
    "x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) all - sky monitor ( asm ) has been continuously monitoring the x - ray sky for years , and has to date observed many outburst episodes from the rb . this outburst behavior is described in detail by guerriero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and a more general summary of the properties of the rb is given by lewin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .    despite considerable study of this object in x - rays",
    ", there remains no optical counterpart , which is almost surely due to the extreme crowding from cluster stars as well as high interstellar extinction .",
    "there have been past searches for ir bursts , analogous to the extraordinary x - ray behavior , using large ( @xmath2 ) apertures centered on the cluster .",
    "the results , summarized by lewin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , are tantalizing but ambiguous . direct identification of a stellar ir counterpart would thus be extremely important in planning of follow - on studies of this fascinating object .",
    "optical work will be extremely difficult for this system , as the interstellar reddening is e@xmath3 for liller 1 ( frogel et al .",
    "1995 ; ortolani et al .",
    "in passing we note that the cluster itself is also astrophysically important : frogel et al .",
    "( 1995 ) conclude it is the most metal rich cluster known .",
    "the most accurate x - ray position to date for the rb was derived from _ einstein _",
    "observations by grindlay et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , but the uncertainty there is still several arcseconds .",
    "moreover , there is a considerable ( @xmath4 ) discrepancy between that x - ray position and recently determined positions of a probable radio counterpart .",
    "moore et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and fruchter & goss ( 2000 ) both report on a variable radio source near the center of the cluster .",
    "specifically , moore et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found an apparent correlation between the changes in radio and x - ray fluxes , which strongly implies that the radio counterpart to the rapid buster has indeed been isolated .",
    "these authors also discuss in detail a likely explanation for the x - ray / radio positional discrepancy , wherein the uncertainty in the x - ray position is underestimated and the uncertainty distribution strongly non - gaussian .    in order to both resolve the positional discrepancy and determine a far more accurate x - ray position , we have obtained high angular resolution x - ray imaging of the liller 1 field with _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and hrc - i . working within a much smaller error circle for the x - ray / radio source",
    ", we have made the first ir / optical imaging search for the counterpart in these bands .",
    "we make use of both ground - based observations obtained during an outburst episode and _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations obtained during a quiescent phase .",
    "furthermore , we have serendipitously detected three low luminosity x - ray sources in the core , for which we also analyze the _ hst _ ir photometry .",
    "we observed liller 1 with _",
    "chandra _ for 15.4 ks on 2000 august 2 . the @xmath530@xmath630@xmath7 field - of - view high resolution camera imager ( hrc - i",
    "; murray et al .",
    "1997 ) was approximately centered on the cluster center .",
    "this mode provides the highest possible spatial resolution available from _ chandra _ , to achieve our primary science goal , and its large fov raises the probability of detecting additional x - ray sources , which can be matched to cataloged optical star positions , thus improving the astrometry even farther .",
    "however , unlike the x - ray ccd detectors , the hrc - i detector has very poor intrinsic energy resolution , so we have no spectral information . on the other hand ,",
    "it does provide very good time - resolution , down to 16@xmath8 .",
    "data reduction was undertaken with routines in ciao v2.1 .",
    "in addition to the very bright rb , a mexican - hat wavelet source detection routine ( wavdetect ) found 9 sources at greater than 3@xmath9 above background in the entire field , beyond the rb s contaminating psf wings ( a @xmath510radius region ) .",
    "the routine also gave the source positions , according to the well - determined satellite aspect for this observation .",
    "we then compared all these x - ray source positions with both the usno a-2 and tycho-2 catalogs ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ; hg et al 2000 ) which contain very accurate ( within @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively ) star positions , to identify any matches .",
    "unfortunately , only one match was made to a 10th magnitude star , tyc 7380 - 976 - 1 , in the tycho-2 catalog .",
    "an offset of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in r.a . and",
    "dec . was found between its nominal _ chandra _ and cataloged positions .",
    "this is consistent at @xmath14 level with the expected uncertainty of @xmath5@xmath15 of the _ chandra _ aspect solution for the hrc - i , as determined for many such x - ray - optical pairs in all observations to date .",
    "we therefore apply this correction to the nominal _ chandra _ position for the rb , and derive a new x - ray position of @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 , @xmath20@xmath21@xmath18@xmath15 , where we conservatively quote our uncertainties as those of the _ chandra _ aspect .",
    "we are then immediately able to compare the new _ chandra _ x - ray position to the various published positions , as tabulated in table  [ tab : posns ] and illustrated in figures  [ fig : posns ] and [ fig : posns2 ] .",
    "there can be no doubt about the consistency of the new x - ray position with the two radio results , providing compelling evidence of their association , and thus confirming the inaccuracy of the old _ einstein _ result .",

    "a circular region of 2  radius ( encircling 97% of the energy ) and an annulus ( 80120 ) were defined centered on the rb to measure source flux and background respectively .",
    "the events were then summed into 1s bins using the ciao routine lightcurve , for each region . given the brightness of the source flux , and the steady very low level of background flux , we decided that background subtraction was unnecessary .",
    "two illustrative sections of the lightcurve are shown in figure  [ fig : cxolc ] ; showing type - ii bursts every @xmath5100s , and two additional type - i burst events ( judging solely on morphology ) in the lower panel . in terms",
    "of the evolution of rb outbursts ( marshall et al 1979 ; guerriero et al .",
    "1999 ) , the source was clearly in an active state , exhibiting the rapid , quasi - regular type - ii bursting characteristic of the final stages ( mode - ii ) of the phase ii of an outburst .",
    "we also note that the level of the persistent ( i.e. between all bursts ) flux did decrease by @xmath530% over the course of the observation .",
    "consideration of the asm lightcurve ( figure  [ fig : asmlc ] , lower panel ) confirms that our _ chandra _ observation was indeed made in the tail of an outburst , which began about july 10th , 29 days previous . in general , this july 2000 outburst appears to have been weaker than either that of august 1998 or others reported by guerriero et al .",
    "we have used the range of best fit two - component blackbody spectra as measured by these authors , to convert hrc - i counts to flux , and indeed we measure the persistent unabsorbed flux ( 0.210 kev ) to be @xmath32 , more than a 1000 times fainter than quoted by guerriero et al . at a similar stage during other outbursts .",
    "this is yet another example of the complex outbursting behaviour of the rb .",
    "we do note , however , that low as this flux is , it is still @xmath510 times brighter than the quiescent detection made by _ asca _ ( asai et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the exquisite psf of _ chandra_/hrc - i opens up for the first time the possibility of detecting a population of fainter x - ray sources co - inhabiting the center of a cluster with a bright lmxb .",
    "we have undertaken such a search within the half - mass radius ( 27 , harris 1996 ) of liller 1 .",
    "this region is still largely dominated by the wings of the rb psf . however , using makegti and dmfilter routines we have created a summed image , using only time - intervals when the rb is between bursts , and many times fainter .",
    "we used a sliding cell technique ( celldetect ) to identify sources , which were then centroided to give the nominal _ chandra _ positions .",
    "four sources were detected ; the rb of course , plus two additional ones at @xmath335 @xmath9 confidence and a third at @xmath54 @xmath9 .",
    "the corrected positions , count rates , assumed spectral models and corresponding luminosities ( quoted in the 0.52.5 kev band for ease of comparison to _ rosat _ results ) are detailed in table  [ tab : cxo_dim ] .",

    "we have performed aperture photometry on all stars within 2  of each x - ray / radio source position , and constructed an ir color - magnitude diagram ( see fig .",

    "the stars within each 1 @xmath9 error region are identified by the boxes . in the case of the rb ,",
    "its counterpart is most likely to lie within the overlap region of its three positional determinations , hence we have also numbered four stars therein .",
    "unfortunately , it is immediately obvious than none of these stars of positional interest have markedly unusual ir colors at the epoch of the _ hst _ observations . as the rb was in quiescence during this nicmos observation",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : asmlc ] ) , all four sources were x - ray faint at the time .",
    "the lack of unusual ir colors implies that there was little contribution from any accretion disc and that we are mostly observing the secondary star in each case ; hence their ir colors are those of a typical cluster star . in terms of variability ,",
    "a qlmxb typically shows ellipsoidal variations , due to the changing aspect of the distorted ( roche lobe - filling ) donor star . however , these observations were relatively short , and can place no useful constraints on such variability .      in an attempt to detect the rb counterpart by observing its ir variability , we have also obtained a set of time - resolved , @xmath73 resolution imaging observations of liller 1 in the k  band , taken with the apache point ( apo ) 3.5-m telescope during a recent x - ray outburst episode which began around 1998 august 17 ( fox & lewin 1998 ) .",
    "the observations were acquired on multiple nights in 1998 august - september , approximately one hour per night , including times of simultaneous pointed x - ray observation by rxte during which x - ray bursts were recorded .",
    "we search both the x - ray and radio error circles for a variable object , using an image - subtraction technique .",
    "the infrared apo observations were done with the grim ii infrared imager , which yields @xmath74 pixel@xmath38 over the @xmath75 array in its f/10 mode . we attempted observations on eight nights , of which five yielded usable data .",
    "figure  [ fig : asmlc ] shows the asm x - ray light curve with the epochs of our ir apo observations overlaid . due to the hour angle and southern declination ,",
    "only @xmath76 hr of observation was possible on each night .",
    "the best exposures were stacked to create a deep image for each night .",
    "the resolution of the stacked images ranged from @xmath77 to @xmath27 .",
    "grim often produces better image quality than this , but not at this large airmass @xmath78 ) .",
    "the ir images are stacked to improve signal to noise and remove detector imperfections .",
    "first we look for possible variability between nights by stacking the best exposures from each night and subtracting the stacks from one another .",
    "the stacked images are rotated and shifted to align optimally , and the image with the better psf is convolved with a kernel which causes both images to have matching psfs .",
    "the kernel is determined with the _ psfmatch _ task in the immatch package within iraf .",
    "finally , the two images are scaled to the same relative flux and subtracted .",
    "no obvious significant flux difference is evident within the x - ray / radio error circles in the subtracted images . to quantify the flux difference that should have been detectable , we add artificial stars in the original stacked images .",
    "we extract a bright star psf , scale it appropriately , and add it to the images in regions near the error circles with similar flux levels .",
    "we find that we could have easily detected a flux difference corresponding to a @xmath79 object fading by 1 mag .    on 1998 august 28 one orbit of _ rxte _",
    "pca x - ray observation was simultaneous with our ir observation .",
    "type i and ii x - ray bursts were detected during this x - ray observation .",
    "the x - ray observation window and the observed burst times were kindly provided to us by d. fox ( private communication ) .",
    "we stack all the ir exposures which occurred during an x - ray burst and subtracted a stack of exposures which were obtained between bursts .",
    "again , no obvious excess flux is detected .",
    "using artificial star tests , we determine that we could have easily detected a flux difference corresponding to a @xmath79 object fading by 1 mag inside the x - ray / radio error circles .",
    "the accurate x - ray position and corresponding astrometric solution imply that there is unlikely to be a confident identification of an ir counterpart to the rb on positional grounds alone : the field is simply too complex , and we are largely ignorant of the expected ir properties of this exotic object .",
    "thus detection of variability might be a key to identification of the counterpart .",
    "previous ir observations of this object made use of large aperture ( @xmath2 ) photometers .",
    "several ir bursts were claimed in some of these previous studies ( e.g. kulkarni et al . 1979 ) although additional extensive ir non - detections are documented by lawrence et al .",
    "( 1983a ) , who cast doubt upon previous claims .",
    "indeed , the bursts detected by kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1979 ) would be fabulously bright if real : the peak intensities appear to be comparable to the total flux of the center @xmath80 of the entire cluster .",
    "such intense bursts would have nearly saturated our detector .    in order to make a separate estimate of the ir flux we might expect , we use the example of an optical burst observed from mxb163653 by lawrence et al .",
    "( 1983b ) . using the observed persistent and brightest ubv magnitudes for that object",
    ", we estimate a persistent @xmath81 and brightest @xmath82 based on the 25,000 and 50,000 k blackbody temperatures , respectively , derived by lawrence et al .",
    "( 1983b ) . assuming a similar distance and correcting for the reddening to liller  1 , e@xmath3 , we crudely estimate a persistent @xmath83 and brightest @xmath84 .",
    "this argument was originally put forward by fox et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who reached a similar conclusion .",
    "it is unclear how accurate these estimates may be , as the absolute optical / ir luminosity depends heavily upon the size of the reprocessing region ; moreover as not even an orbital period is known for the rb , we have no idea whether its geometry is comparable to mxb163653 .",
    "our observed upper limits from the ground - based ir data fall short of testing these model estimates , principally due to seeing effects .",
    "however , such tests should be feasible with future _ hst _ or ground - based adaptive - optics ir observations . in the case of the three probable qlmxbs we have detected with _",
    "chandra _ , the identification of counterparts may prove even more difficult .",
    "detection of ellipsoidal variability or another observation catching a source in outburst might work .",
    "however , we have little knowledge as to their outburst recurrence timescales , as x - ray source confusion with the rb has always been a limitation before .",
    "even the long - term coverage of the liller  1 field by _",
    "rxte_/asm shows no evidence for more than one source going into outburst , and pointed observations during these outbursts have always confirmed the rb as the source .",
    "interestingly , one of low luminosity sources , cxou j173324.1 - 332316.0 , is aligned with the old _ einstein _ position for the rb .",
    "one might speculate that if this source were in outburst at the time of that determination it might have contributed at least to an underestimation of the true positional uncertainties for the rb . in any case our new precise _ chandra _ position , consistent with two independent radio positions , confirms without doubt the true location of the rb within liller 1 .",
