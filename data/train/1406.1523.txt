    "in a classic paper@xcite on the statistical mechanical theory of solutions in equilibrium mcmillan and mayer ( hereafter mm ) derived the following two results ( or theorems ) :    * mmi * : for a solution with any number of components , the solvent variables in the grand canonical partition function can be formally `` integrated out '' leaving an effective partition function for the solutes only . the total effective solute potential entering the effective solute partition function",
    "is the true vacuum solute interaction potential plus a contribution induced by the integrated - out solvent .",
    "the total effective solute potential can be decomposed into a sum of one - body , two - body , etc , effective solute potentials .",
    "these effective solute potentials are potentials of mean force ( pmfs ) for the solute molecules .",
    "* mmii * : using the results of mmi , the osmotic pressure @xmath9 of a dilute solution can be developed in a virial series in the solute concentration , analogous to the gas virial expansion for the pressure @xmath7 in powers of the gas density at low density .",
    "the statistical mechanical expressions for the osmotic pressure virial coefficients have exactly the same form as the expressions for the gas pressure virial coefficients , with solute pmfs replacing gas vacuum potentials .",
    "a few years after the mm paper appeared , another classic paper @xcite on the statistical mechanical theory of solutions in equilibrium was published by kirkwood and buff ( hereafter kb ) .",
    "this paper gives molecular expressions for specific solution macroscopic properties , i.e. , the isothermal compressibility , the partial molecular volumes , and the inverse osmotic susceptibilities , in terms of what are now called kb integrals .",
    "the latter are the integrals @xmath10 over the solution pair correlation functions @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 label the molecular species , e.g. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a two - component solution , and @xmath14 is the separation between the centers of an @xmath15 pair of molecules .",
    "the pair correlation functions themselves can in principle be determined @xcite both theoretically , from liquid state simulations and analytic methods using model intermolecular potentials , and experimentally , from x - ray and neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "kb theory has been simplified , extended , reviewed extensively @xcite , and widely applied @xcite .",
    "one leading practitioner has expressed the opinion `` i believe that in all regards the kb theory is immensely superior to the mm theory , as i hope to convince the reader ... '' .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that , with current and future developments , mm theory could be far more useful than is now the case , although there is no doubt that at the present time , particularly since the introduction of the ben naim kb inversion technique@xcite , which expresses the kb integrals in terms of the specific macroscopic properties mentioned above , kb theory is used much more .",
    "in contrast to kb theory , mm theory has not been greatly simplified or extended , and has been reviewed @xcite infrequently .",
    "it also has not been widely applied , with one exception : the osmotic pressure virial expansion .",
    "for a two - component solution with dilute solute ( species a ) in a solvent ( species b ) , the mm result for the osmotic pressure @xmath9 as a virial series in solute number density @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number of solute molecules and @xmath6 is the system volume , is    @xmath18~ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath8 the temperature ,   and @xmath20 the solvent chemical potential .",
    "the first virial term @xmath21 is the famous vant hoff solute one - body term which is universal , i.e. , independent of all intermolecular interactions , and has the same form as the ideal gas pressure .",
    "solution properties whose first virial term depends only on the solute number density and is independent of solute molecular details and interactions are called colligative .",
    "the second term , with coefficient @xmath22 , is @xmath23 and takes into account the contribution from pairs of interacting solute molecules in the solvent , and the mm molecular expression for this osmotic second virial coefficient is    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the pmf for a pair of solute molecules at infinite dilution in the solvent , which is written as an explicit function of solute - solute separation @xmath14 and which also depends implictly on solvent chemical potential and temperature .",
    "note that ( [ eq1.2 ] ) has the same form as the expression for the gas second virial coefficient , with pair pmf @xmath26 in place of the vacuum pair potential @xmath27 which occurs in the gas second virial coefficient expression .",
    "this is an example of mmii above .",
    "equation ( [ eq1.1 ] ) has long been used @xcite by polymer , biopolymer and colloid solution researchers to obtain molecular weights of macromolecules ( from the first virial term @xmath21 ) and to study macromolecule solute - solute interactions ( using the second virial term ) .",
    "the osmotic second virial coefficient has also been used in discussions of the hydrophobic interaction of small nonpolar solutes in water@xcite , and we give an example in the concluding section .",
    "unfortunately the mm paper @xcite is very hard to read and this is likely the main reason for the relative neglect of mm theory compared to kb theory . indeed , as another leading practitioner @xcite has put it `` ... somewhere , hidden in an impenetrable jungle of notation in the 1945 paper of mcmillan and mayer , must be the potential distribution theorem ! '' as it turns out the widom potential distribution theorem@xcite ( also called the particle insertion theorem ) is not explicitly written down by mm ( hill@xcite comes close in his reformulation of mm theory using the semi - grand canonical ensemble - see remarks following ) .",
    "we find that the widom expression for the excess chemical potential of a solute molecule in an otherwise pure solvent is the first virial term in the virial expansion of the solute chemical potential @xmath28 ; the latter expansion is obtained by differentiating the semi - grand potential virial series with respect to solute number @xmath17 .",
    "the semi - grand potential is the thermodynamic potential generated by the semi - grand canonical ensemble ( grand with respect to solvent only ) , the ensemble we employ in this paper .",
    "mm did not obtain the semi - grand potential series because they worked with the full grand canonical ensemble which generates the grand potential . because the grand potential is proportional to the pressure",
    ", mm obtained the virial series ( [ eq1.1 ] ) for the osmotic pressure directly , and because this series has a trivial first virial term , a nontrivial first virial term which occurs for non - colligative properties such as the solute chemical potential is not visible explicitly .",
    "some of the difficulty of the mm paper has been reduced by hill @xcite who separates better the quantum and classical discussions , does not include solid solutions in the discussion , discusses explicitly a two - component classical liquid solution , and introduces a semi - grand canonical ensemble to derive mmi . in this paper",
    "we greatly simplify the presentation further by working with the semi - grand canonical ensemble in a new way to derive mmi as described in the next paragraph , and by using a simple and nongraphical virial expansion method @xcite to derive mmii from mmi .",
    "we also extend mm theory by deriving virial expansions for other properties such as the enthalpy of mixing , which are needed to analyze recent isothermal titration calorimetry ( itc ) experiments @xcite on dilute peptide aqueous solutions .    in the next section , for a classical two - component liquid solution",
    "we introduce a semi - grand canonical ensemble which is grand canonical with respect to the solvent(b ) and canonical with respect to the solute(a ) ; the complete set of independent variables is @xmath2 .",
    "these state conditions are the natural ones for analysis of osmotic pressure experiments where the solvent and solution are in contact through a semi - permeable membrane ( so that @xmath20 is fixed ) and the solution pressure is measured as a function of the controlled solute number @xmath17 at fixed solution volume @xmath6 and temperature @xmath8 .",
    "various semi - grand ensembles have been discussed in the literature , starting with stockmayer @xcite ( see also @xcite ) who , in order to discuss light scattering from multicomponent dilute solutions , introduced a constant pressure ensemble which is grand with respect to the solutes but not with respect to the solvent .",
    "the semi - grand canonical ensemble we employ was introduced by hill @xcite .",
    "this ensemble was also used to derive mmi by kodytek@xcite , who , however , needlessly complicated the derivation by introducing the total solute pmf in the canonical ensemble , and by dijkstra et al @xcite .",
    "our discussion of mmi is similar in spirit to those of hill@xcite and dijkstra et al@xcite , but simpler , because rather than focussing on the semi - grand potential for the solution , we focus instead on the difference between the solution and solvent semi - grand potentials , which can be expressed in terms of the logarithm of the ratio of the solution and solvent semi - grand partition functions . as with other such problems in statistical mechanics involving the difference in free energies for two systems with some state conditions in common , such as zwanzig s thermodynamic perturbation theory@xcite , van kampen s gas virial expansion method@xcite , and widom s particle insertion theorem@xcite , the ratio of partition functions generates automatically the required solvent - to - solution change in the form of a normalized average , and this average can be expressed in terms of the total solute pmf and its one - body , two - body , etc , components from simple physical considerations .",
    "thus , for example , in contrast to reference @xcite , in discussing mmi we do not need graphical methods , and a zero - body term in our total solute pmf does not arise .",
    "this will become clearer in section iii .",
    "a similar semi - grand ensemble but with fixed pressure rather than fixed volume has been introduced for computer simulations of multicomponent solutions @xcite .    in section iii",
    "we introduce the solute pmfs , first @xmath29 for the complete set of @xmath17 solute molecules as a function of their configuration @xmath30 , and then reduced pmfs for isolated groups of one , two , three , etc , solute molecules alone in the solvent , i.e. , @xmath31 , etc .",
    ", respectively , where @xmath32 is the position of solute molecule @xmath33 , @xmath34 the separation of solute molecules @xmath33 and @xmath35 , etc .",
    "these are related in the usual way to the corresponding solute reduced distribution and correlation functions , and to mean forces on solute molecules under the proper constraints @xcite .",
    "the semi - grand canonical ensemble partition function introduced in section ii is re - expressed in terms of an effective solute - only canonical ensemble partition function involving @xmath29 .",
    "the total solute pmf or effective potential @xmath29 is then decomposed into a sum of its one - body , two - body , etc , components , involving @xmath36 , etc .",
    "this is the semi - grand canonical ensemble version of mmi . for the reasons discussed",
    ", we believe this derivation of mmi to be much simpler than those presented previously .",
    "the virial expansions are introduced in section iv .",
    "starting with the result of section iii expressing the semi - grand canonical partition function in terms of the effective solute - only canonical ensemble partition function involving the effective solute potential @xmath29 and its decomposition into one - body , two - body , etc , components , we assume a dilute solution and derive a virial series in @xmath37 for the difference between the solution and solvent semi - grand potentials , @xmath38 , from which we immediately obtain the virial series for the osmotic pressure @xmath39 , where @xmath7 and @xmath40 are the solution and solvent pressures , both at chemical potential @xmath20 .",
    "this is the semi - grand canonical version of mmii .",
    "our derivation is much simplified compared to that of mm by using a simple nongraphical canonical ensemble virial expansion method developed for gases @xcite .",
    "another advantage , mentioned above , is that the virial series for @xmath41 , unlike that for @xmath9 , has a nontrivial first virial coefficient , which is needed for other non - colligative properties such as solute chemical potential and solubility , and we extend mm theory and derive virial expansions for various such properties including the enthalpy of mixing .",
    "for some of the extensions , we also change independent variables from semi - grand canonical variables @xmath2 to those more relevant to the particular experiment , e.g. , @xmath3 for the enthalpy of mixing experiment . in this section",
    "we also clarify the relation between mm theory and widom s potential distribution theory .",
    "the paper concludes with a simple example , and some remarks on ongoing work by our group .",
    "we first consider the classical statistical mechanics of a binary liquid solution of @xmath17 identical solute molecules and @xmath42 identical solvent molecules in equilibrium at temperature @xmath8 in a volume @xmath6 .",
    "for notational simplicity we consider monatomic molecules but , as we indicate later , the final results are immediately generalizable to polyatomic molecules which may be nonrigid .",
    "we write the hamiltonian @xmath43 as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 denotes the momentum of molecule @xmath46 , @xmath47 the mass of an @xmath0-molecule , @xmath48 the configuration of the @xmath0-molecules , and assuming pairwise additive vacuum potentials , the total potential energy @xmath49 is given by    @xmath50    here @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the total solute - solute , solvent - solvent and solute - solvent potentials , respectively , and @xmath53 the separation between molecules @xmath46 and @xmath54 . the assumption that @xmath55 , etc , are pairwise additive is again for notational convenience , and without this assumption the derivation to follow goes through with no substantive change .    with canonical ensemble conditions of fixed @xmath56 , the canonical ensemble partition function @xmath57 for the solution is    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is planck s constant , and here and throughout the paper the configurational integrals are over the volume @xmath6 .",
    "note that @xmath57 is dimensionless . because the momentum integrals in ( [ eq2.3 ] ) are gaussian , the kinetic part of the partition function can be evaluated analytically giving    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the thermal wavelengh of an a - molecule ,    @xmath62    the helmholtz free energy @xmath63 of the solution is calculated from the canonical partition function using    @xmath64    as described earlier , mm worked in the grand canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the grand canonical partition function @xmath65 is related to the canonical partition function @xmath66 by the double discrete laplace transform    @xmath67    and the corresponding grand potential @xmath68 is related to the helmholtz free energy @xmath69 by the double legendre transform    @xmath70    ( in thermodynamic relations like ( [ eq2.8 ] ) we should strictly use the averages @xmath71 and @xmath72 , but since the relative fluctuations in @xmath17 and @xmath42 are negligible for macroscopic systems no harm will come from using the simpler notation @xmath17 and @xmath42 for the average numbers . )    following hill@xcite we find it simpler to work in a semi - grand canonical ensemble ( grand with respect to solvent only ) , with semi - grand canonical partition function @xmath73 defined by the single laplace transform of the canonical partition function @xmath66 ,    @xmath74    and corresponding semi - grand potential @xmath75 related to the helmholtz free energy @xmath69 by the single legendre transform @xmath76 as discussed in the introduction , @xmath77 are the natural control variables for analysis of osmotic pressure experiments . from ( [ eq2.10 ] ) and the standard expression for the differential @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the entropy , we find for @xmath81 @xmath82 from ( [ eq2.12 ] ) we obtain the pressure @xmath7 and solute chemical potential @xmath28 using @xmath83 we consider the ratio of solution / pure solvent semi - grand canonical partition funtions at the same @xmath84 state conditions , i.e. @xmath85 , where the pure solvent semi - grand partition function @xmath86 is also a grand partition function and could just as well be denoted @xmath87 . from ( [ eq2.9 ] ) and ( [ eq2.4 ] )",
    "we can express these two partition functions as @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 . from the last two equations we see that the ratio @xmath85 can be written as @xmath91 where the solvent grand - canonical average @xmath92 of a quantity which depends on @xmath1-coordinates but not @xmath1-momenta is @xmath93 in the averaging @xmath94 in ( [ eq2.16 ] ) using ( [ eq2.17 ] ) , the solute @xmath0-coordinates are held fixed , and the solvent @xmath1-coordinates are averaged over with normalized boltzmann weight @xmath95 . in the final step we multiply and divide ( [ eq2.16 ] ) by @xmath96 and",
    "write it as @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes an unweighted average over the @xmath0-coordinates , @xmath99 the solution - solvent difference of semi - grand potentials is @xmath100 . from ( [ eq2.18 ] ) , using the standard stirling approximation for large numbers @xmath101 , we find for the dimensionless difference @xmath102 the expression @xmath103 where the ideal gas value of the solute helmholtz free energy is given by @xmath104 with @xmath16 the solute number density .",
    "the inner solvent average @xmath105 in ( [ eq2.20 ] ) is a dimensionless positive function of the fixed @xmath0-configuration @xmath30 , which we write as @xmath106 which defines a solvent - induced effective @xmath0-potential @xmath107 .",
    "we form the total effective @xmath0-potential @xmath29 by adding the vacuum solute potential @xmath108 , @xmath109 where the total vacuum @xmath0-potential @xmath55 is defined in ( [ eq2.2 ] ) for our model .",
    "the complete average in ( [ eq2.20 ] ) then has the form @xmath110 the right side of ( [ eq3.3 ] ) has the form of a solute - only canonical ensemble configurational partition function , since the solvent @xmath1-coordinates have been integrated out in defining the effective solute potential @xmath29 .",
    "this is the semi - grand canonical ensemble version of the mmi theorem discussed in the introduction . in terms of the total effective solute potential @xmath111 , using ( [ eq3.3 ] ) and ( [ eq2.19 ] ) we re - write the semi - grand potential ( [ eq2.20 ] ) in terms of the solute average @xmath112 ,    @xmath113    the total solute effective potential @xmath29 is the pmf for the whole set of solute a molecules ( see discussion later in this section ) . in our model , for simplicity the total solute vacuum potential @xmath55 has been assumed to be pairwise additive , @xmath114 . in contrast , the total solute effective potential @xmath29 will necessarily contain one - body , two - body , three - body , etc , terms : @xmath115 this is a cluster decomposition of the total effective potential @xmath116 .",
    "we give next an intuitive derivation of ( [ eq3.4 ] ) , with explicit expressions for the one- and two - body terms , and a few more details are given in appendix a.    at very low solute concentrations ( infinite dilution ) , we neglect pairs , triplets , etc , of @xmath0 molecules . in the solvent average @xmath94 with fixed @xmath0-configuration",
    ", we assume the @xmath0-molecules are all isolated from each other and write the average as    @xmath117    where the contibutions @xmath118 , etc , to @xmath119 from molecules @xmath120 , etc , in the average ( [ eq3.5 ] ) have been assumed uncorrelated due to the assumption of far - apart @xmath0-molecules ; in the pairwise additive vacuum potential model these contributions are given explicitly by @xmath121 , etc .",
    "the last step in ( [ eq3.5 ] ) simply defines the effective solute one - body potentials @xmath122 , etc , by    @xmath123    the average in ( [ eq3.6 ] ) involves the interaction with the solvent of just one solute molecule @xmath33 fixed at position @xmath124 , averaged over the solvent configurations . for @xmath17 identical solute molecules in a uniform solvent the effective one - body potentials @xmath125 are all equal and independent of position , so that the last expression in ( [ eq3.5 ] ) is the product of @xmath126 identical constant factors . the total one - body pmf term in ( [ eq3.4 ] ) ,   @xmath127 , is thus given by    @xmath128    where @xmath129 is the constant one - body potential defined by ( [ eq3.6 ] ) . equation ( [ eq3.6 ] ) defining @xmath129 was first derived by widom @xcite with potential distribution theory using the canonical ensemble , and its physical significance is discussed further later .",
    "we now consider a slightly increased solute concentration so that solute - solute pair interactions , but no triplets etc , also need to be considered .",
    "suppose the fixed @xmath0-configuration has the @xmath130 pair and a few other solute pairs close together , and the other solute molecules isolated .",
    "just as ( [ eq3.5 ] ) factored into a product of uncorrelated one - body terms at infinite dilution , now the average @xmath131 will factor into a product of uncorrelated two - body terms such as @xmath132 and other such terms arising from the close @xmath0-pairs , and constant factors coming from the uncorrelated and isolated @xmath0-molecules .",
    "we denote the @xmath130 pair term by    @xmath133    according to ( [ eq3.8 ] ) we now fix two solute molecules @xmath33 and @xmath35 at positions @xmath124 and @xmath134 in the otherwise pure solvent , and average the exponential of @xmath135 over solvent configurations . if @xmath33 and @xmath35 are far apart as assumed previously , the result is @xmath136 as before . when @xmath33 and @xmath35 are close together , the result is modified and denoted by the right side of ( [ eq3.8 ] ) , thereby defining a solvent - induced contribution @xmath137 to the total effective @xmath138 pair potential @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the vacuum pair potential .",
    "thus @xmath141 is the extra contribution , beyond @xmath142 , to the solvent - induced effective potential of solute molecules @xmath33 and @xmath35 , and is therefore normalized such that @xmath143 for @xmath144 , the same normalization as the vacuum pair potential @xmath145 .",
    "the total effective @xmath146 pair potential @xmath147 thus has the same normalization .",
    "the total effective pairwise solute potential is a sum of terms like @xmath148 as written in ( [ eq3.4 ] )",
    ". equation ( [ eq3.8 ] ) is easily related to one derived in potential disribution theory @xcite for the solute - solute pair correlation function at infinite dilution @xmath149 , using ( see below ) @xmath150 .",
    "this brief derivation of the effective pairwise term is elaborated in appendix a.    in the next section we will consider virial expansions to @xmath23 so that we will not need to consider the triplet @xmath151 , etc , effective solute potentials in ( [ eq3.4 ] ) in this paper , but it is clear how they can be generated by continuing the pattern @xmath152 , ...  .",
    "the total effective solute potential @xmath153 , and its component @xmath154-body effective potentials @xmath155 , @xmath156 , are solute pmfs .",
    "these are reversible works , or changes in constrained free energy ( here the semi - grand potential ) , when , starting from rest and far apart in the vacuum , we add solute molecules at fixed positions to the pure solvent at a given chemical potential and temperature .",
    "thus @xmath157 is the reversible work to add a solute molecule at position @xmath124 in the pure solvent , with fixed state conditions @xmath158 . for this case , where we add just one solute molecule to the pure solvent , the work is a solvent intensive property and we can just as well regard @xmath159 or @xmath160 as fixed , so that this reversible work is also equal to the changes in gibbs and helmholtz free energies .",
    "like all pmfs @xcite , the gradient gives the mean force on a molecule ; here @xmath161 gives the solvent - averaged mean force on a solute molecule fixed at @xmath124 . in this case",
    "the mean force vanishes , as it should for a uniform solvent , as @xmath157 is independent of @xmath124 .",
    "similarly , the total reversible work to add a pair of solute molecules @xmath33 and @xmath35 to the pure solvent at positions @xmath124 and @xmath134 , starting with @xmath33 and @xmath35 at rest and far apart in the vacuum , is @xmath162 .",
    "the terms @xmath163 give the reversible work to add @xmath33 and @xmath35 to the solvent keeping them far apart , and @xmath164 is the reversible work to bring them to finite separation @xmath34 in the solvent , starting far apart .",
    "for the pair pmf @xmath148 ,   @xmath165 gives the solvent - averaged mean force on solute molecule @xmath33 fixed at @xmath124 , with @xmath35 fixed at @xmath134 .",
    "this mean force will be nonvanishing if the separation @xmath34 between @xmath33 and @xmath35 is not too large .",
    "part of the mean force is the vacuum force @xmath166 and the other part @xmath167 is induced by the solvent .",
    "pmfs can be expressed in terms of the logarithm of the corresponding correlation functions@xcite .",
    "thus for @xmath148 we have @xmath168 , where @xmath149 is the solute - solute pair correlation function for an infinitely dilute solution .    for notational simplicity",
    "we have assumed monatomic solute and solvent molecules . for polyatomic molecules , which may be nonrigid , besides the obvious change@xcite required for the solute ideal gas free energy ( [ eq2.21 ] ) ,",
    "one need only include the internal coordinates of the solute and solvent molecules in the averaging over the @xmath1-coordinates when forming the total effective solute potential for the solute molecular centers @xmath29 , and its one - body and two - body components @xmath157 and @xmath148 calculated using ( [ eq3.6 ] ) and ( [ eq3.8 ] ) .",
    "the internal degrees of freedom effectively all become part of the solvent to be integrated out , in forming the effective solute potentials which depend only on the coordinates of the fixed solute molecular centers ( usually chosen to be the centers of mass ) .",
    "here we assume a dilute solution and derive the virial expansions for various properties .",
    "we first employ a simple canonical ensemble technique , developed for gas virial expansions by van kampen@xcite ( see also landau and lifshitz@xcite ) , to derive the virial series in solute concentration @xmath169 for the change of semi - grand potential upon adding @xmath17 solute molecules to pure solvent at fixed solvent chemical potential , volume , and temperature , @xmath170 .",
    "because our effective solute partition function is canonical , we can use the van kampen canonical ensemble method and thereby avoid the complications of the standard grand canonical ensemble method ; the concentration expansion is derived directly with no need for the introduction and subsequent elimination of an activity expansion , and no graphs at all are needed , which avoids the problem of defining the graphs , with their various types such as reducible and irreducible , and then showing that the net result is due only to the irreducible ones . from this basic virial series ,",
    "we then use thermodynamic arguments to derive virial series for the solute and solvent chemical potentials , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , the osmotic pressure @xmath174 , and the changes of the gibbs free energy and enthalpy , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "as is clear from the notation , some of these derived series involve changing independent variables as well as the dependent one .",
    "the semi - grand potential is an extensive quantity , and we now assume low solute concentration and derive a virial series for @xmath178 to @xmath179 , i.e. ,    @xmath180    where @xmath181 is defined in ( [ eq2.21 ] ) , and @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the first and second virial coefficients for the quantity @xmath184 .",
    "note that @xmath182 is dimensionless and @xmath183 has dimensions of volume .",
    "the virial coefficients to be defined later for other properties will also have these dimensions for the most part .    from the virial series ( [ eq4.1 ] ) for @xmath41 we immediately get one for the solute chemical potential @xmath28 by differentiating with respect to @xmath17 ( see the second thermodynamic relation in ( [ eq2.13 ] ) ) ,    @xmath185    where @xmath186 is the ideal monatomic gas value ( which will be different for polyatomic solutes ) .",
    "the solute chemical potential is an intensive property and for a binary solution can be expressed in terms of three independent intensive variables , here chosen to be @xmath187 .",
    "the virial series ( [ eq4.1 ] ) will now be derived using ( [ eq4.3 ] ) from an analysis of the low order solute clusters which dominate the average @xmath188 at low solute concentrations . at very low solute concentration ( infinite dilution ) , essentially only isolated solute molecules occur and thus only the one - body term @xmath189 in @xmath111 will matter , as pair , etc , interactions are negligible . because the one - body term is independent of the @xmath0-coordinates ( see ( [ eq3.7 ] ) ) the averaging in ( [ eq4.3 ] ) is redundant and a contribution to @xmath41 linear in @xmath17 results , with first virial cofficient @xmath182 given by    @xmath190    where @xmath129 is defined by ( [ eq3.6 ] ) .",
    "the physical significance of @xmath129 is now apparent from ( [ eq4.2 ] ) and ( [ eq4.4 ] ) : @xmath129 defined by ( [ eq3.6 ] ) is the solute excess chemical potential at infinite dilution , @xmath191 for @xmath192 , as first shown by widom@xcite with potential distribution theory using the canonical ensemble .",
    "we now consider slightly increased solute concentrations such that essentially only solute singlets and pairs occur , and thus one - body and two - body , but not three - body , etc , solute interaction terms in @xmath29 need to be considered , i.e. , the first two terms in ( [ eq3.4 ] ) .",
