    "+ let us consider a spatially flat frw universe dominated by pressureless matter ( baryonic plus dark matter ) and the energy of the quantum vacuum ( the latter with eos @xmath49 ) in which a process of dark matter ( dm ) creation from the gravitational field , governed by @xmath50 is taking place . in writing the last equation",

    "note that when the dynamics associated with the particles prodution rate is given by a @xmath127 , model i for example , there is a great suppression in the density contrast as we increase the rate production of matter .",
    "when dynamic models are considered , models ii and iii , they are not observed large deviations in compared to theoretical prediction of @xmath77cdm model .",
    "we have shown via lensing - rs cross - power spectrum that the scale where the nonlinear growth overcomes the linear effect depends strongly of particles creation rate , this is , with the dynamic nature associated the @xmath4 .",
    "+ obviously , phenomenological models of particle production different from the ones essayed here are also worth exploring .",
    "more important , however , is to determine the rate @xmath38 using quantum field theory , but , as said above , this does not seem feasible until the nature of dm particles is found . thus , hopefully through the development here performed within the context process of structure formation , help clarify the dynamic nature associated with the cosmological creation of particles .",
