    "the discovery of ferromagnetic superconductors uge@xmath0  @xcite , uruge  @xcite , ucoge  @xcite , in which ferromagnetic ordering coexists with superconductivity , has given a new trend in understanding of unconventional superconductivity .",
    "the pressure - temperature phase diagrams of these compounds differ , but the common feature is that the superconductivity occurs in the domain of ferromagnetic phase and the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 is lower than the curie temperature , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 orders ferromagnetically at relatively high curie temperature of 53 k and superconductivity appears upon the application of pressure of about 1 gpa , and at low temperature @xmath6 k. the increase of pressure to the critical value @xmath7 gpa results in disappearance of both ferromagnetic and superconducting order .",
    "+ uruge and ucoge are weaker ferromagnets with @xmath4 of 9.5 k and 3 k , respectively and the superconducting phase appears at ambient pressure as well . for uruge",
    "the increase of pressure leads to the collapse of superconductivity at about 4 gpa , while for ucoge the phase transition line gradually grows reaching maximum at 1.1 gpa , where the ferromagnetic order collapses and superconductivity persists also in the paramagnetic region .",
    "all three uranium compounds have orthorhombic crystal structure with highly anisotropic magnetic moment of ising type . for detailed presentation of ferromagnetic superconductors , see , for example , the recent review  @xcite .",
    "+ it is commonly accepted that 5f electrons of uranium atoms are responsible for both ferromagnetic and superconducting orders . in the presence of magnetization",
    ", the ferromagnetic exchange field is expected to rule out spin - singlet cooper pairing and unconventional superconductivity of p - type , mediated through some magnetic mechanism is considered as the most likely .",
    "the experimental discovery of huge upper critical field in urhge and ucoge also confirms the triplet pairing because the pauli paramagnetic effect characteristic of spin singlet pairing is absent there , see , for example  @xcite and the papers cited therein .",
    "the anisotropic properties of superconductivity in these compounds are vastly studied experimentally , especially the anisotropic properties of upper critical field  @xcite .",
    "+ here we will study phenomenologically the role of magnetic , crystal and cooper - pair anisotropy on the phase diagram and possible phases using the previously derived ginzburg - landau free energy  @xcite .",
    "we will consider only the meissner phases  pure superconductors and phases of coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in the absence of external magnetic field . in earlier papers  @xcite we did not consider the cooper - pair and crystal anisotropy as the main purpose was to describe the @xmath8 phase diagram . because the coexisting phase of @xmath5 is totally within the domain of ferromagnetic phase we have assumed that it is the presence of ferromagnetism that triggers the appearance of superconductivity under external pressure .",
    "the pressure participates only through the linear dependence of curie temperature on @xmath9 , namely , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the curie temperature at zero ( ambient ) pressure and @xmath12 is the pressure close to the critical @xmath13 where ferromagnetism and superconductivity disappear .",
    "this free energy and the obtained results may be a good starting point for the description of @xmath14 phase diagram in ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "the general form of ginzburg - landau free energy for the meissner phase of ferromagnetic superconductors with @xmath15-pairing is :    @xmath16    the free energy density @xmath17 of pure superconducting system is expanded up to the fourth order in superconducting order parameter , including the respective anisotropic terms .",
    "here we suppose tetragonal symmetry for superconductors with triplet cooper pairing  @xcite .",
    "although all three uranium compounds uge@xmath0 , urhge and ucoge have orthorhombic symmetry and the structure of superconducting order parameter for orthorhombic symmetry has been derived by general group considerations  @xcite , here we shall not consider for the time being the anisotropy in @xmath18 plane , but only the uniaxial anisotropy , connected with the ising - like anisotropy of magnetization , _",

    "the negative sign of @xmath79 makes the interval @xmath104 smaller . for @xmath105",

    "direct comparison with experiment requires that assumptions should be made about the dependence of curie temperature on the pressure for each particular ferromagnetic superconductor uge@xmath0 , urhge and ucoge .",
    "then different experimentally obtained phase diagrams and other experimental data should be used to find the material parameters of the landau energy  ( [ eq6 ] ) for each compound .",
    "+ here we discuss in detail the limitations for the use of free energy  ( [ eq6 ] ) to the description especially of uge@xmath0 .",
    "the calculations show that including the cooper - pair and crystal anisotropy terms for the description of @xmath8 phase diagram using the approach described in  @xcite with both linear , and quadratic dependence of curie temperature on the pressure , does not rule out the main discrepancies between the experimentally found phase diagram and the one , calculated on the basis of landau energy  ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "+ first of all the transition from paramagnetic phase to ferromagnetic around @xmath129 experimentally is of first order up to the tricritical point @xmath130 , where the transition becomes of second order down to @xmath43 .",
    "see fig .  4 for the experimental phase diagram of uge@xmath0 .",
    "the first order phase transition from paramagnetic to @xmath131 phase can be modeled by expanding the magnetic energy density  ( [ eq3 ] ) to @xmath132 , then the parameter @xmath133 in front of @xmath134-term should change sign with pressure from negative to positive at tricritical point in fig .  4 .",
    "in  @xcite the first order transition from paramagnetic to low polarized ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath131 ) is described in detail by including @xmath132-term and the coupling of elastic and magnetic degrees of freedom in  ( [ eq3 ] ) and modeling the dependence of @xmath133 and @xmath4 on pressure .",
    "the calculations show that when the ferromagnetic energy density is expanded up to @xmath132 to determine the total phase diagram with the coexisting phase becomes too complicated as the free energy density of the pure superconducting phase , ( [ eq2 ] ) should be also expanded to sixth order in superconducting order parameter .",
    "otherwise there is no region of existence of ferromagnetic superconductor to the left of maximum on the phase transition line from ferromagnetic to coexisting phase within the numerical accuracy of calculation .",
    "+ taking into account the crystal and cooper - pair anisotropy terms additionally complicates the problem as the landau energy will depend on a bigger number of material parameters which are difficult to identify and compare with experimental data . moreover ,",
    "even the inclusion of sixth order term does not describe the transition from ferromagnetic low polarized ( @xmath131 ) to high polarized ( @xmath135 ) ferromagnetic phase , line @xmath136 in fig .  4 , which is important as the maximum at the phase line between ferromagnetic phase and coexisting phase is near to this ferromagnetic transition .",
    "it is clear from above considerations that direct application of landau energy is not suitable to use for uge@xmath0 , as it is necessary to expand it to higher terms in @xmath137  sixth and eight in order to describe the complex ferromagnetic transitions under pressure in this compound . as the appearance of superconductivity is triggered by the ferromagnetism this forces the inclusion of higher order terms also in the expansion of superconducting order parameter .",
    "the number of material parameters become too big in order to make any reasonable comparison with experiment .",
    "another problem is related to the way , in which @xmath4 and @xmath136 depend on pressure and the compressibility .",
    "+ the experimental @xmath14 phase diagram of urhge is also peculiar as the ferromagnetic transition line with the increase of pressure goes upward up to the highest pressure measured of @xmath138 gpa .",
    "the magnetic moment exhibits also strong uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the coexisting phase is completely within the ferromagnetic domain and occurs at ambient pressure , too . when pressure grows the coexisting phase line decreases and vanishes at @xmath139 gpa .",
    "the unusual experimental pressure dependence of curie temperature can not be easily modeled so to directly apply the landau energy  ( [ eq1 ] ) to the description of this phase diagram .",
    "ucoge is weak itinerant ferromagnet and is the only uranium compound up to now , for which the superconductivity appears not only in the domain of ferromagnetic phase but also in the paramagnetic region up to 2.2 gpa , while the ferromagnetic order is suppressed for @xmath140 gpa .",
    "the ferromagnetic superconducting phase exists also at ambient pressure and magnetic moment shows uniaxial anisotropy of ising type . in comparison with uge@xmath0 and urhge",
    ", the phase diagram of ucoge may be described using the landau energy ( [ eq1 ] ) , if the real orthorhombic crystal anisotropy is considered together with the form of superconducting order parameter derived by general group considerations in  @xcite for this crystal symmetry .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed phenomenologically the role of magnetic , cooper - pair and crystal anisotropy for the description of phase diagrams of some ferromagnetic superconductors . the phase diagram is mainly determined by the uniaxial anisotropy of magnetization ; the cooper - pair and crystal anisotropies slightly change the behavior of phase transitions lines in the vicinity of @xmath141 , @xmath129 .",
    "so the application of ginzburg - landau free energy up to the fourth order expansion of superconducting and magnetic order parameters may serve as initial estimate .",
    "the results and analysis show that the crucial point for the proper phenomenological description of phase of coexistence between ferromagnetism and superconductivity in uge@xmath0 , urhge and ucoge is related to the ferromagnetic transitions under pressure in these compounds .",
    "more theoretical study is needed in this direction .",
