    "for the past few decades chaotic dynamical systems with a few degrees of freedom ( dofs ) have been investigated theoretically , numerically , and experimentally with enthusiasm , which has brought various insights about them . since one can not follow individual trajectories in chaotic systems by any means , one of the subjects attracting interest is evaluation of dynamical averages , namely asymptotic time averages and fluctuations of some observables along typical orbits . the thermodynamic formalism @xcite , which is frequently used for multifractal analysis @xcite , is exploited for this purpose @xcite and the concept of dynamical averaging has been remarkably developed by means of unstable periodic orbit expansion , trace formulae , and dynamical zeta function , which reveal the role of unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) as a skeleton of chaos @xcite . on the other hand , the thermodynamic formalism is sometimes discussed in the context of phase transitions , called q - phase transitions .",
    "this is not a transition dealt with in statistical mechanics which involves large fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities and occurs only in the thermodynamic limit , but a transition with large dynamical fluctuations of observables which occurs in the long - time limit .",
    "it has been shown that the large fluctuations reflect the dynamics and q - phase transitions indicate a singular local structure of the chaotic attractor , such as homoclinic tangencies of stable and unstable manifolds and band crises @xcite .    despite the understanding of low - dimensional chaotic systems , less",
    "is known about spatially extended systems whose number of active dofs is large or infinite .",
    "this is partly because of difficulty in treating concepts such as measures for infinite - dimensional dynamical systems in a mathematically proper way @xcite , and partly because of computational complexity ; e.g. with regarding to the upo expansion , not only does the number of upos grow exponentially with increasing dofs , but even finding one upo becomes much more laboring . however , the number of dofs one can numerically investigate increases gradually , which makes it possible for various theoretical concepts and methods to be extended and applied to high - dimensional chaos @xcite .",
    "it leads to reveal several suggestive properties intrinsic to spatially extended systems , which have been reported recently .",
    "for example , it was found that one can reproduce macroscopic quantities of turbulence only from a single upo @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking manifestations of high dimensionality is the occurrence of phase transitions . in the case of coupled map lattices ( cmls ) , i.e. lattices of interacting dynamical systems",
    "whose time evolution is defined by a map , logistic cmls are known to display nontrivial collective behavior which can not be observed in equilibrium systems , and transitions between two types of collective behavior can be regarded as phase transitions @xcite .",
    "another interesting example of non - equilibrium phase transitions is 2-dimensional cmls which exhibit a continuous phase transition similar to that of the ising model @xcite .",
    "the existence of a new universality class was numerically shown for such cmls with synchronously updating rules , while those asynchronously updated belong to the 2d ising universality class @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest that the ising - like transitions of synchronous cmls and the onset of the non - trivial collective behavior of a logistic cml belong to the same universality class , i.e. the non - ising class @xcite .",
    "although many interesting properties of non - equilibrium phase transitions have been found out , there seems nevertheless no consensus on the usage of the term `` phase transition '' in dynamical systems .",
    "theoretically , it can be defined as a qualitative change in the statistical behavior of typical orbits in a single mixing attractor which does not change topologically @xcite , by which we exclude bifurcations coming up even in finite - dimensional dynamical systems . for the definition of `` qualitative change , '' the analogy with that in equilibrium phase transitions",
    "there are two complementary manners of characterizing equilibrium transitions @xcite : one is after ehrenfest , where @xmath0-th order phase transitions are identified as divergence or discontinuity of some @xmath0-th derivative of the free energy .",
    "the other is after gibbs , where first - order phase transitions correspond to a change in the number of the pure gibbs measures , or macrostates .",
    "analogues of the latter have been adopted in the context of dynamical systems since no free energy appears useful : if we consider interaction in a formal hamiltonian on the space - time configuration space and define a free energy from it , then the analyticity of the free energy is a very delicate problem @xcite and too complicated to relate to phase transitions . on the other hand ,",
    "if we define a free energy from purely probabilistic measure approach as we will see below , then it is identically zero and thus analytic in the whole parameter region , even at criticality , due to a strong constraint which comes from a normalization of the measure @xcite .",
    "therefore , transitions have been defined in the gibbsian sense @xcite , that is via a change of the number of natural measures , which corresponds to first order transitions .",
    "this definition , however , can not characterize higher order transitions as definitively , so we have to make use of more subtle phenomena , such as spontaneous symmetry breaking , divergence of a correlation length , formation of an infinite cluster , and so on .",
    "it is true that they are closely related to phase transitions , but would not prescribe them as quantitatively as equilibrium counterparts do .",
    "thus , it is desirable to develop another way to characterize phase transitions in extended chaos , including higher order ones .",
    "another issue involved with phase transitions in extended chaotic systems is absence of macroscopic `` temperature '' which controls the systems .",
    "some locally defined parameters such as coupling strength and diffusion coefficient have been used as _ ad hoc _ substitutes for temperature ( e.g. @xcite ) , while its theoretical grounds remain to be clarified .",
    "this treatment is based on an assumption that such local parameters are direct barometers of macroscopic properties .",
    "this is however not at all trivial , as we can see for example from studies of effective temperature in non - equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "although we can argue the issue to some extent by renormalization group approach , it can not deal with concrete systems .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have a basis on which we can connect locally defined time evolution rule of a system to macroscopic properties .    in the present paper , we characterize phase transitions in extended chaotic systems , namely cmls , including both equilibrium and non - equilibrium ones .",
    "the periodic orbit expansion and the thermodynamic formalism are adapted for such systems , by which the relation between q - phase transitions and ( actual ) phase transitions is investigated .",
    "the main outcomes are that ( 1 ) a rather quantitative way to define non - equilibrium phase transitions with their order in the ehrenfest s sense is proposed , and ( 2 ) a basis is obtained on which microscopic control parameters can be handled similarly to temperature in some cases involved with phase transitions .",
    "note that it is not the aim of this paper to give a mathematically rigorous argument , which is often highly delicate in this field @xcite and may limit an attainable conclusion .",
    "instead , we shall devote ourselves to obtain a physically plausible picture .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first review the idea of upo ensemble @xcite ( sec . [ sec:2.a ] ) , and on its basis the thermodynamic formalism is formulated to deal with dynamical averages and fluctuations of some macroscopic quantity in chaotic systems with many dofs ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2.b ] ) . a corresponding partition function and topological pressure , or `` free energy '' ,",
    "are defined and the moments are obtained as its differential coefficients",
    ". then we apply it to a 1d bernoulli cml ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) which can be regarded as a deterministic model of the 1d ising model as is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.a ] .",
    "after we mention the computational procedure for the thermodynamic formalism ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3.b ] ) , we show that an anomalous distribution of upos exists in such a system with phase transitions ( marginal transitions in this example ) , which can be regarded as a seed of the ising transition ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3.c ] ) .",
    "the seed is embodied as a q - phase transition .",
    "another example is a 1d repelling cml which exhibits a non - marginal transition ( sec .",

    "this is a solvable case , hence we can explicitly see the relation between phase transitions and q - phase transitions .",

    "an examination of the behavior of infinite - size systems requires that we first take the limit @xmath198 and then @xmath199 , at variance with usual statistical mechanics where the limit is taken over sizes of all dimensions simultaneously .",
    "this may be the reason why some extended chaotic systems defined in @xmath36-dimensional space show critical behaviors of @xmath36-dimensional universality classes despite the corresponding @xmath35-dimensional configuration space @xcite .",
    "the problem of the incommutability should be considered seriously , since the definition of phase transitions by means of the singularity of the gmf involves both the limit @xmath38 .",
    "another problem is on the arbitrariness for the choice of a macroscopic quantity @xmath3 when we deal with q - phase transitions with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "there is no clear criterion for it , except for that @xmath3 must be affected by phase transitions : its expectation value or fluctuation must show a discontinuity or divergence .",
    "an order parameter of the considered transition is a candidate . in our examples in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] , however , we adopted the quantity which can be regarded as energy on the analogy with equilibrium spin systems .",
    "the relation between the choice for @xmath3 and the behavior of q - phase transition curves near critical points remains to be clarified , especially about their linear dependence on control parameters such as eq .",
    "( [ eq:5.1 ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , the old concept of the thermodynamic formalism and the periodic orbit expansion turns out to be useful to characterize phase transitions in extended dynamical systems .",
    "theoretically , one possible definition of phase transitions is proposed , which is complementary to the usual definition in terms of a change in the number of natural measures .",
    "it can be used to classify and examine non - equilibrium transitions in chaotic systems , especially higher order transitions , with the help of a suitable technique to generate or approximate the upo ensemble .",
    "recently developed method such as ref .",
    "@xcite might be applied for this purpose .",
    "with regard to experiments and numerical simulations , a ground is obtained on which we can sometimes treat an externally imposed control parameter as macroscopic `` temperature '' around phase transition points .",
    "although some significant problems are left for future studies , this assertion is expected to support discussions on universality classes in non - equilibrium systems from real and numerical experiments",
