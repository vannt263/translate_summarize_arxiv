    "submillimetre ( submm ) galaxies . ] ( smgs ; see @xcite for a review ) are some of the most luminous , rapidly star - forming galaxies ( with star formation rates of @xmath5 ; e.g. , @xcite ) in the universe .",
    "although simulations have suggested that merger - induced starbursts can produce the submm fluxes characteristic of smgs @xcite , explaining the observed number density of such prodigious star - formers has posed a challenge for semi - analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has caused some to consider them a challenge for @xmath6cdm @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that treatment of the effects of blending caused by the large beam sizes ( fwhm @xmath7 arcsec , or @xmath8 kpc at @xmath9 ) of the single - dish telescopes used to identify smgs can help alleviate the discrepancy between the smg number counts predicted by models and those observed .",
    "specifically , during the pre - coalescence phase of major mergers , both progenitor discs can be blended into a single submm source ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , h13 ) suggest that such ` galaxy - pair ' smgs account for a significant fraction ( @xmath10 per cent ) of the smg population .",
    "interferometric observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have provided many examples of single - dish smgs that are resolved into multiple components when observed at an order - of - magnitude better resolution , and in some cases , the redshifts and kinematics suggest that the individual sources are widely separated ( projected separation @xmath11 kpc ) discs in the process of merging .",
    "recent interferometric continuum imaging surveys suggest that of order half of single - dish - detected smgs are blends of two or more distinct components @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in those surveys , the brightest sources ( those with 870-  flux density @xmath12 mjy ) are almost all blended sources . however , there are at least fifteen examples of interferometrically observed sources that are brighter than the suggested flux density cutoffs ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "thus , the fraction of single - dish submm sources that are blended and the brightest submm flux density of a single galaxy are still uncertain .",
    "a submm flux - density cutoff suggests an upper limit on the star formation rate ( sfr ) of smgs @xcite , which may be a consequence of feedback from star formation and/or active galactic nuclei but may also be simply a consequence of limited gas supply .",
    "it also suggests that to reproduce the brightest smgs , models must account for the effects of blending . in this work ,",
    "one question that we address is whether we can reproduce the number counts of the brightest smgs via blended sources alone .",
    "early - stage mergers are only one type of blended submm source ; it is also possible that spatially ( and thus physically ) unassociated projected multiples contribute to the smg population .",
    "there is already anecdotal evidence for this subpopulation : @xcite present two examples of smgs that are resolved into multiple components by the submillimeter array ( sma ) and for which the resolved components are located at significantly different redshifts ( in one case , the difference between the two components is @xmath13 , and in the other , the three components have redshifts of 2.914 , 3.157 , and 3.46 ) .",
    "thus , the individual components are not widely separated galaxies that will merge but rather chance projections of completely unrelated galaxies",
    ". some of the sources observed by @xcite may also be examples of this subpopulation .",
    "the relative contribution of such projected multiples to the smg population is currently unconstrained .",
    "however , this situation is likely to change soon , once redshifts for a significant number of the sources from the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) follow - up observations @xcite of the large apex bolometer camera ( laboca ; @xcite ) extended _ chandra _ deep field south submillimetre survey ( less ; @xcite ) sources are available .",
    "thus , a prediction for the relative contributions of spatially associated and unassociated components is particularly timely .    in this work ,",
    "we make such a prediction .",
    "to do so , we use halo catalogues derived from a cosmological simulation .",
    "stellar masses and sfrs are assigned using observationally constrained stellar mass and sfr  halo mass relations .",
    "for each galaxy , we assign an 850-  flux density @xmath14 using a fitting function , which was previously derived from the results of dust radiative transfer performed on hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc and merging galaxies , that gives @xmath14 as a function of sfr and dust mass .",
    "then , we search the mock catalogues for blended submm sources and calculate the total submm flux density for each blended source . using a cut based on the redshift separations of the individual components of the blended sources , we separate the blended sources into ` spatially associated ' and ` spatially unassociated ' subpopulations and calculate the relative contributions to the submm number counts as a function of single - dish submm flux density .",
    "the remainder of this work is organised as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the details of our method . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our predictions for the cumulative submm number counts for different beam sizes , the relative contributions of spatially associated and unassociated sources , and the distribution of redshift separations amongst the individual components of blended sources . in section 4 , we discuss some implications of our results . section 5 presents our conclusions and plans for future work .",
    "the method used in this work differs significantly from that of h13 because the method used in h13 can not treat spatially unassociated projected multiples . here",
    ", we use mock lightcones derived from a cosmological simulation to provide information about the large - scale clustering of dark matter haloes .",
    "we start with halo catalogues from the _ bolshoi _ simulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is a collisionless dark matter simulation performed using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ; @xcite ) code .",
    "the _ bolshoi _",
    "simulation volume has side length 250 @xmath15 mpc and contains @xmath16 particles , which yields a mass resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "the force resolution is 1 @xmath15 kpc ( physical ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters used for _ bolshoi _ are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with the wmap7+bao+h@xmath23 results @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 are also consistent with the recent _ planck _ results @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) used is @xmath29 greater ( @xmath30 less ) than that from _",
    "planck_. nevertheless , the uncertainty in the cosmological parameters should affect our results less than the other uncertainties discussed below .",
    "starting at eight random locations within the simulation volume , we select haloes along a randomly oriented sightline with an 84 x 84 ( 1.96 deg@xmath31 ) field of view from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ; this redshift range contains the bulk of the smg population , both in the real universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in our model ( for reasons discussed below ) .",
    "cosmological redshifts are calculated including the effects of halo peculiar velocities .",
    "stellar masses are assigned based on the stellar mass  halo mass relation of @xcite , which accounts for redshift - dependent scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass and the effects of systematic observational biases in stellar mass recovery .",
    "sfrs are assigned based on the sfr  halo mass relation of @xcite ; this includes redshift - dependent scatter in sfrs at fixed halo mass and the increasingly tight correlation between stellar mass and sfr at fixed halo mass at high redshifts . to approximate environmental effects near massive clusters ,",
    "satellite sfrs are reduced by a factor equal to their current subhalo mass divided by the peak mass in their subhalo s mass accretion history .",
    "this is only a toy model for satellite quenching , of course .",
    "however , our results should be insensitive to the inclusion of satellite quenching because satellites are typically too submm - faint to contribute to the ( detectable ) smg population .",
    "our method ensures that the mock sample has stellar mass functions , average specific sfrs , cosmic star formation history , and autocorrelation as a function of stellar mass that are consistent with observations . because the model reproduces the mean sfr for a given stellar mass ( including some scatter ) and redshift rather than @xmath34 for individual haloes , the elevation in sfr associated with starbursts",
    "is not included , so we simply do not treat that subpopulation of smgs in this work .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in section [ s : limitations ] .      to assign submm fluxes to the mock galaxies , we use the following fitting function , which was derived using the results of sunrise @xcite dust radiative transfer calculations performed on gadget-3 @xcite smoothed - particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc and merging galaxies ( eq .",
    "15 of h13 ) : @xmath35 where @xmath14 is the observed - frame 850-  flux density and @xmath36 is the dust mass ( we describe the method for assigning @xmath36 below ) .",
    "this function can recover the submm flux of simulated galaxies in the redshift range @xmath37 to within a scatter of 0.13 dex because the negative @xmath38-correction makes the observed - frame @xmath14 of a fixed galaxy sed almost independent of @xmath39 in the range @xmath40 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it under - predicts the flux at lower redshifts , significantly so for @xmath41 .",
    "however , because the normalization of the sfr@xmath42 relation decreases strongly from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the volume in the range @xmath45 is a small fraction of the total @xmath46 volume , both the observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and predicted ( @xcite ; h13 ) fraction of smgs with @xmath47 is small ; thus , this under - prediction should not significantly affect our results . because the @xcite bias ( see also @xcite ) can affect the shape of the number counts , we incorporate the scatter of 0.13 dex when assigning flux densities to the mock galaxies .",
    "the fitting function requires the sfr and @xmath36 of each mock galaxy .",
    "the sfr is already determined from the @xcite method . to assign dust mass values ,",
    "we follow the method of h13 , in which the gas fraction @xmath48 and metallicity @xmath49 are parameterized as functions of stellar mass and redshift and it is assumed that 40 per cent of the metals are contained in dust grains .",
    "the functional form for @xmath50 is physically motivated , and the parameters are constrained to match @xmath51 observations ; see @xcite for details . the form for @xmath52 is based on the observed stellar mass  metallicity relation at different redshifts ; see h13 for details .",
    "we note that because @xmath14 scales significantly sublinearly with both sfr and @xmath36 , the predictions are relatively insensitive to variations in these quantities ; e.g. , a factor of 2 change in either quantity changes @xmath14 by less than 50 per cent .",
    "once submm flux densities are assigned to all mock galaxies , we perform a brute - force search for blended multiples .",
    "first , we select only those sources with @xmath1 mjy because fainter sources are below the flux density limits of current single - dish surveys and interferometric follow - up observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . and 2 mjy .",
    "the quantitative predictions for the absolute number counts change , but the relative contributions of the subpopulations and the distributions of the redshift separations of components are relatively robust .",
    "furthermore , the conclusions are qualitatively unchanged , and this uncertainty is subdominant to that associated with the treatment of blending . ]",
    "this flux cut yields a minimum flux density of @xmath53 mjy for @xmath53-component blended sources .",
    "then , for each source @xmath54 in this subsample , we compute the angular distance to all sources @xmath55 in the subsample for which @xmath56 ( to avoid double - counting ) . if one or more sources is within a ` beam size ' . ] of source @xmath54 , which we vary , we consider the sources to be blended and sum their @xmath14 values to calculate the total @xmath14 for the blended source .    for each blended source , we compute a measure of the redshift separation of the components by summing the redshift separations between the first component and all other components in quadrature : @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the redshift of the @xmath54th component and @xmath59 is the total number of components of the blended source .",
    "this is a somewhat arbitrary ( yet natural ) measure : for two components , @xmath60 is simply the difference in the redshifts of the two components . for sources with @xmath2 components",
    ", @xmath61 indicates that at least one of the components is at significantly different @xmath39 than the others .",
    "below , we define ` spatially associated ' and ` spatially unassociated ' blended sources by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . the justification for and insensitivity of our results to the value of this cut are presented in section [ s : z_sep ] .",
    "[ fig : false_pairs ] presents a simple illustration of the difference between spatially associated and unassociated projected pairs .",
    "the panels show the positions of a sample of mock galaxies projected onto the @xmath64 ( left ) and @xmath65 ( right ) planes .",
    "the galaxy pairs marked with red symbols are spatially associated in 3d ( and thus also in projection ) .",
    "in contrast , the galaxy pairs marked with blue symbols appear to be associated in the @xmath64 projection , but the @xmath65 projection clearly demonstrates that they are spatially unassociated . without accurate redshifts , an observer viewing these galaxies along the @xmath49 axis can not distinguish between these two types of projected pairs .",
    "this figure also illustrates how the spatial information provided by cosmological simulations is essential for treating the contribution of spatially unassociated projected multiples to the smg population .",
    "[ fig : counts ] shows the smg cumulative number counts ( deg@xmath66 ) versus @xmath14 ( mjy ) predicted for beam sizes of 15 arcsec ( which is representative of the resolution of the single - dish telescopes used to determine the observed counts ) and 7 arcsec ( for a conservative estimate of the effects of blending ) and when blending is not included .",

    "the @xcite counts are significantly more discrepant .",
    "@xcite argue that the origin of the discrepancy between their counts and others observed for similarly sized fields is the impact of galaxy - galaxy weak lensing due to higher than average matter density along the line of sight .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the association of the excess bright sources with foreground galaxy overdensities at @xmath75 .",
    "we do not include the effects of lensing here and thus would not produce this effect if it is the cause .",
    "however , the magnitude of the effect of lensing on the submm counts is still uncertain ; see section [ s : limitations ] for further discussion .",
    "the difference between the predictions for the 15-arcsec beam ( red solid line ) and 7-arcsec beam ( blue dashed line ) indicates that the total number counts of the blended sources quantitatively depend on the beam size , as one navely expects .",
    "this suggests that the counts observed by telescopes of different resolutions will differ , as is already known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the difference also partially reflects uncertainty in the number counts predicted by our model because of our simple treatment of blending ( see section [ s : limitations ] ) .",
    "fortunately , there are multiple predictions that are robust to this aspect of the model ; we discuss these predictions below .",
    "note also the significant uncertainty in the @xmath76 mjy counts ( depending on the amount of blending ) , which originates from sample variance and scatter in the sfr  halo mass relation .",
    "this affects all the counts , including the ` no blending ' case , because the maximum overdensity sampled varies with the field .",
    "it further affects the counts that include blending by altering the probability that two high - sigma peaks have sufficiently small projected separation to be blended .",
    "thus , even for independent fields with areas as large as @xmath77 deg@xmath31 , the counts of the brightest sources vary significantly . this effect could be the reason that the @xcite and @xcite samples vary in terms of the maximum flux density of non - blended smgs .",
    "for example , for a @xmath4 deg@xmath31 field , the flux density of the brightest non - blended source observed can vary in the range @xmath78 mjy ( note that inclusion of starbursts would increase these values ) , and this effect is of course more significant for smaller surveys .",
    "less , the survey from which the sources observed by @xcite were drawn , covers an area of 0.25 deg@xmath31 , and the @xcite sources were drawn from the central 0.7 deg@xmath31 of the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; @xcite ) field .",

    "furthermore , we must account for the sources with @xmath12 mjy that are clearly not blended sources , because some examples are known ( see @xcite for further discussion ) ; it is very difficult to explain such objects without invoking starbursts induced by major mergers or disc instabilities .",

    "* ) , but it is especially acute for them because 1 .",
    "observations of smgs are more limited than for local and/or less dusty galaxies and 2 .",
    "the small dynamic range of submm flux density currently probed and the steepness of the number counts implies that relatively small changes in flux density  caused by , e.g. , blending ",
    "can qualitatively affect the conclusions .",
    "because of the large beam sizes that are characteristic of far - ir observations , other far - ir - selected populations ( e.g. , ` hot - dust ulirgs ' ; @xcite ) should also be affected by the blending effects discussed here .      properly treating blending",
    "may reconcile the longstanding discrepancy between the far - ir and ( sub)mm counts predicted by cosmological simulations and sams and those observed .",
    "furthermore , the possible ubiquity of blended submm sources has an important implication for interpreting smg observations : if many of the brightest sources are actually multiple unrelated galaxies , the sfrs inferred under the assumption that a single submm source corresponds to a single galaxy would overestimate the true sfrs of individual galaxies .",
    "such an overestimate of the abundance of the most rapidly star - forming galaxies may relieve the tension between the sfrs of the mock smgs in the cosmological simulation of @xcite and those inferred from single - dish observations .    to obtain the true sfrs of individual galaxies ,",
    "resolved photometry of the individual components is required . in the uv ",
    "optical , this process is limited by the significant attenuation that is characteristic of smgs . in the ir(sub)mm ,",
    "the resolution is the limitation .",
    "the alma continuum measurements from the less follow - up survey @xcite will help in this regard , but additional high - resolution data in the far - ir , particularly shortward of the peak of the dust emission , are necessary to accurately constrain the ir luminosity and thus infer the sfrs of the individual components . therefore , the question of whether the sfrs of galaxies in cosmological simulations and real galaxies are in tension should be revisited when possible .",
    "although the model presented in this work and that of h13 have some ingredients in common , they differ in the following important aspects : ( 1 ) here , we directly include information about large - scale structure by using mock galaxy catalogues generated from the _ bolshoi _ simulation . in h13 , the cosmological context was obtained solely through the use of merger rates calibrated to cosmological simulations and an assumed stellar mass function .",
    "consequently , no spatial information was included , and thus chance projections of spatially unassociated galaxies could not be treated .",
    "( 2 ) in h13 , the effects of blending were included for early - stage mergers , but in a cruder manner ( by assuming a fixed timescale ) than in this work .",
    "( 3 ) because the procedure to generate the mock galaxy catalogues relies on an sfr  halo mass relation ( that depends on redshift and includes some scatter ) , the full sfr enhancement caused by merger - induced starbursts is not included in this work . in h13 , the submm light curves for merger - induced starbursts were directly calculated by performing dust radiative transfer on hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "consequently , the sfr enhancement in such objects was treated in the h13 model .",
    "the differences described above imply that neither the h13 model nor that presented here can fully treat all proposed smg subpopulations .",
    "thus , the predictions of the two models can not be directly compared .",
    "however , additional insight can be obtained by combining some of their results .",
    "here , we have demonstrated that blending of unassociated galaxies can significantly boost the submm number counts .",
    "thus , our results reinforce the conclusion of h13 that given a demographically accurate model galaxy population ( i.e. , one with stellar mass functions and merger rates consistent with observations ) , the observed submm counts can be matched without recourse to variation in the stellar initial mass function .",
    "furthermore , if spatially unassociated multiples were included in the h13 model , it is possible that the model would overpredict the observed counts .",
    "such an overprediction could imply that the normalisation of the stellar mass function used in the h13 model is too high or that the h13 simulations are missing some important form of feedback that limits the sfr in starbursts .",
    "the strength of the model presented in this work is that it naturally includes information about large - scale structure and thus enables us to physically characterise the effects of blending for both spatially associated and unassociated galaxies ; in contrast , h13 treated only the blending of the components of early - stage mergers , and the treatment was significantly cruder .",
    "however , the method used here naturally also has some limitations .",
    "first , the method by which we assign sfrs to galaxies treats scatter in the sfr  halo mass relation at a given mass and redshift , but it does not faithfully reproduce the sfr evolution of individual haloes . in particular , the elevation in sfr associated with merger - induced starbursts ( i.e. , the high - sfr tail at a given halo mass ) , which is generically predicted by idealised simulations of major mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , is not included .",
    "it would be possible to include this effect in an empirically motivated manner ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , because merger - induced starbursts were treated extensively in h13 , and the primary focus of this work is to investigate the contribution of spatially unassociated components to blended smgs , we opt to simply neglect merger - induced starbursts here .",
    "subsets of the spatially associated 2-component and both spatially associated and unassociated @xmath2-component blended smgs should be undergoing merger - induced starbursts .",
    "( the reason that some of the spatially unassociated @xmath2-component blended smgs should be undergoing starbursts is that in those sources , a subset of the components can be spatially and physically related . )",
    "because we do not include the elevation in sfr from starbursts , we underestimate the submm fluxes of such objects .",
    "however , because the duty cycle of the starburst phase is significantly less than that of the ` galaxy - pair smg ' phase ( h13 ) , the galaxies are not likely to be resolved into separate components during the strong starburst phase , and not all encounters cause starbursts , the fraction of blended smgs that are undergoing starbursts should be relatively small . for",
    "more typical spatially associated multiples , which have large separations ( i.e. , @xmath11 kpc ) , the sfr elevation should be relatively modest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , our conclusions regarding the relative contributions of spatially associated and unassociated components to blended smgs and the distributions of the redshift separations of the components would not be significantly affected by the inclusion of starbursts ( but the quantitative predictions regarding , e.g. , the number counts should be affected , and the conclusions regarding the brightest sources may differ ) . still , there is strong observational evidence that galaxies above the main sequence ( i.e. , merger - induced starbursts and gravitationally unstable disc galaxies ) contribute to the smg population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and h13 predicted a significant starburst contribution to the smg population .",
    "thus , we should and will address this shortcoming of the model presented here in future work .    furthermore , the treatment of blending is still somewhat crude , albeit significantly less crude than that used in h13 and far superior to simply ignoring blending .",
    "the difference between the predicted counts for the 15- and 7-arcsec beam sizes illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] indicates that the treatment of blending can significantly affect some predictions of the model .",
    "although there should certainly be differences in the blended smg populations identified using telescopes of different beam sizes , the predictions for a given beam size in the model should not be considered to exactly correspond to observations from a telescope of the same beam size .",
    "rather , for the typical single - dish smg surveys , which have been performed with telescopes with @xmath7-arcsec beams , our predictions for the 15- and 7-arcsec beams should be considered somewhat liberal and very conservative estimates of the number counts of blended smgs , respectively .",
    "finally , we have neglected the effects of gravitational lensing on the predicted number counts . as already mentioned above",
    ", @xcite suggest that galaxy - galaxy lensing is the reason that their counts are significantly higher than those for other fields ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a population of strongly lensed smgs has been observed @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of lensing for sources with @xmath94 mjy is poorly constrained : estimates of the typical magnification for such sources range from @xmath88 per cent ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to of order 10 @xcite .",
    "thus , we have opted to defer a treatment of lensing to future work .      in future work",
    ", we will combine our fitting function for submm flux density with an updated version of the sam of @xcite and @xcite to produce mock submm maps of the galaxies from the sam .",
    "then , to make predictions for various telescopes , we will convolve the maps with the appropriate beams",
    ". this approach will enable us to simultaneously treat the isolated disc , merger - induced starburst , and both spatially associated and unassociated blended smg subpopulations in order to present a more complete picture of the smg population .",
    "furthermore , we will investigate the effects of modifying the prescriptions in the sam for , e.g. , star formation and feedback on the mock smg population .",
    "the spatial information available in our mock smg catalogues makes them a natural tool for investigating smg clustering and the effects of lensing on submm number counts .",
    "finally , we will complement our semi - analytic approach through the use of state - of - the - art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "we created mock smg catalogues by generating lightcones from the _ bolshoi _ simulation , assigning sfrs and dust masses to the mock galaxies in an empirically constrained manner , and using a fitting function from previous work to assign submm flux densities .",
    "then , the mock smg catalogues were used to investigate the effects of blending of multiple galaxies on the smg population .",
    "our principal conclusions are the following :    1 .   for the 15-arcsec beam ,",
    "the predicted counts of blended smgs are consistent with most of the observed counts for typical smgs ( @xmath73 mjy ) but a factor of @xmath74 less than the observed counts for @xmath72 mjy .",
    "the underprediction at the bright end suggests that inclusion of the sfr elevation caused by starbursts is still necessary to reproduce the brightest sources , regardless of whether those sources are blends of multiple components . 2 .",
    "the difference in the maximum flux density of non - blended smgs in the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite samples is consistent with the variation in the flux density of the brightest non - blended smg amongst our mock smg catalogues .",
    "thus , the difference may simply be a consequence of sample variance and scatter in the sfr  halo mass relation .",
    "3 .   both spatially associated and unassociated blended smgs contribute significantly to the population : @xmath0 percent of the blended smgs in our model contain one or more components with @xmath1 mjy that are spatially distinct from the other(s ) .",
    "the fractional contribution depends on both the flux density and beam size . for a 15-arcsec beam ,",
    "blends of @xmath2 galaxies in which at least one galaxy is spatially unassociated with the others dominate the blended sources with total @xmath85 mjy .",
    "the distribution of the redshift separations of the components of blended smgs is strongly bimodal .",
    "for the spatially unassociated subpopulation , the median redshift separation is in the range @xmath95 , depending on the beam size and flux cut .",
    "we stress that the last two conclusions are bona fide predictions in the sense that ( to our knowledge ) currently available observational data are insufficient to test them , but they will be tested as soon as spectroscopic or sufficiently accurate photometric redshifts of the individual components of a sufficient number of blended smgs are available .",
