    "( or _ ruler _ for short ) of order @xmath0 ( also known as a _",
    "sidon set _ ) is a set @xmath1 of integers with @xmath2 having the property that all differences @xmath3 ( for @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ) are distinct .",
    "they were first used by babcock , in connection with radio interference  @xcite .",
    "the _ length _ of a golomb ruler @xmath1 is the largest difference between any two elements of @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to show that a ruler of order @xmath0 has length at least @xmath6 ; a ruler meeting this bound is called _",
    "perfect_. golomb has shown that no perfect ruler exists with order greater than four  @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding the shortest possible length of a golomb ruler of a given order has been widely studied ; no general solution is known , but optimal rulers have been determined for orders less than 24 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the elements of a golomb ruler can be taken to represent marks ( ` dots ' ) on a physical ruler occurring at integer differences from each other .",
    "the fact that the differences are all distinct implies that if a golomb ruler is placed on top of a second , identical , ruler then at most one mark from the upper ruler will coincide with a mark from the lower ruler , unless they are exactly superimposed .",
    "golomb rulers arise in the literature from both theoretical and practical aspects ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the largest order of a ruler of length @xmath7 is @xmath8 , see  @xcite .",
    "there are various generalizations of one - dimensional rulers into two - dimensional arrays .",
    "one of the most general was given by robinson  @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional ruler is an @xmath9 array with @xmath0 dots such that all @xmath6 lines connecting two dots in the array are distinct as vectors , i.e. , any two have either different length or slope .",
    "these arrays were also considered in  @xcite .",
    "the case where @xmath10 was first considered suggested by costas and investigated by golomb and taylor  @xcite .",
    "costas considered the case when @xmath10 and each row and each column in the array has exactly one dot  @xcite .",
    "these arrays have application to a sonar problem  @xcite and also to radar , synchronization , and alignment ; they are known as costas arrays .",
    "sonar sequences are another class of arrays mentioned in  @xcite , where @xmath11 and each column has exactly one dot ; see  @xcite .",
    "other two - dimensional generalizations of a golomb ruler have been considered in the literature , but do not have direct connection to our current work . for the sake of completeness",
    "we will mention them . a _",
    "radar array _ is an @xmath9 array with exactly one dot per column such that there are no two lines connecting two disjoint pairs of dots , occupying the same rows , which have the same length and slope .",
    "radar arrays were defined in  @xcite and considered in  @xcite .",
    "arrays in which all lines have distinct slopes were considered in  @xcite .",
    "arrays in which the euclidean distances of any pair of lines are distinct were considered in  @xcite .",
    "the examples above are concerned with dots in an ( infinite ) square grid that are restricted to lie in a given line segment , square or rectangle .",
    "more generally , we can define a set of dots in a grid to be a _ distinct difference configuration _ (",
    "ddc ) if the lines connecting pairs of dots are different either in length or in slope .",
    "having surveyed the known structures of two - dimensional patterns with distinct differences , it seems that the following natural question has not been investigated : what is the maximum number of dots that can be placed on a two - dimensional square grid such that all lines connecting two dots are different either in their length or their slope and the distance between any two dots is at most @xmath12 ?",
    "in other words , rather than considering the traditional rectangular regions of the square grid , we consider dots which lie in maximal anticodes of diameter @xmath12 .",
    "( an _ anticode of diameter @xmath12 _ is a set of positions in the grid such that any pair of positions are at distance at most  @xmath12 .",
    "see section  [ sec : anticodes ] for details . )",
    "we will consider two notions of distance in the square grid : manhattan and euclidean .",
    "we also consider distinct difference configurations in the hexagonal grid , using hexagonal distance ( also known as manhattan distance ) and euclidean distance .",
    "our motivation for considering these configurations comes from a new application to key predistribution for wireless sensor networks .",
    "we considered in  @xcite a key predistribution scheme based on ddcs in general , and costas arrays in particular .",
    "a ddc @xmath13 with @xmath0 dots was shifted over the two - dimensional square grid . for each shift",
    "we assigned the same key to the @xmath0 entries of the two - dimensional grid which coincide with the @xmath0 dots of @xmath13 .",
    "in @xcite we noted that a costas array is a ddc , and gave examples of ddcs with small numbers of dots .",
    "however , the questions of finding more general constructions , and providing bounds on the number of dots in such configurations , were left open ; it is these issues that are addressed by the results of this paper .",
    "other properties of ddcs motivated by this application are considered in  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : models ] we describe the models on which we will consider our two - dimensional patterns with distinct differences .",
    "we consider two two - dimensional grids : the square grid and the hexagonal grid . in the square grid",
    "we consider the manhattan distance and the euclidean distance , while in the hexagonal grid we consider the hexagonal distance and the euclidean distance .",
    "we define the classes of ddcs we will study , and list optimal examples for small parameter sizes . in section  [ sec : anticodes ]",
    "we explain the relation between ddcs and maximal anticodes .",
    "we classify the maximal anticodes when we use manhattan distance and hexagonal distance .",
    "we also briefly review some properties of anticodes in @xmath14 using euclidean distance : these properties will allow us to bound the size of an anticode in either grid when we use euclidean distance . in section",
    "[ sec : upper_bounds ] we present upper bounds on the number of dots in a ddc when we restrict the dots to lie in some simple regions ( ` shapes ' ) in the grid .",
    "the most important shapes we consider are the anticodes , in particular the lee sphere and the hexagonal sphere . as a consequence of our upper bound",
    ", we settle an old question of golomb and taylor  @xcite ( on the existence of honeycomb arrays of arbitrarily large size ) in the negative . in sections",
    "[ sec : twodpatterns ] and  [ sec : lower ] we turn our attention to constructions and lower bounds for the number of dots in the classes of ddc defined in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "we generalize a folding technique that was used by robinson  @xcite to construct golomb rectangles , and provide more good examples by constructing periodic infinite arrays that are locally ddcs .",
    "our constructions are asymptotically optimal in the case of the square grid and manhattan distance .",
    "we first define some new classes of two - dimensional distinct difference configurations .",
    "we believe that the definitions are very natural and are of theoretical interest , independently of the application we have in mind .",
    "we will consider the square grid and the hexagonal grid as our surface .",
    "we start with a short definition of the two models . before the formal definition we emphasize that we define a point @xmath15 to be the point in column @xmath16 and row @xmath17 of either a coordinate system or a ddc .",
    "hence , rows are indexed from bottom to top in increasing order ; columns are indexed from left to right in increasing order .",
    "( so this is the usual convention for a cartesian co - ordinate system , but is not the standard way of indexing the entries of a finite array . )",
    "the first model is called the _",
    "square model_. in this model , a point @xmath18 has the following four neighbors when we consider the model as a connected graph : @xmath19 we can think of the points in @xmath20 as being the centres of a tiling of the plane by unit squares , with two centres being adjacent exactly when their squares share an edge .",
    "the distance @xmath21 between two points @xmath22 and @xmath23 in this model is the manhattan distance defined by @xmath24    the second model is called the _",
    "hexagonal model_. instead of the square grid , we define the following graph .",
    "we start by tiling the plane @xmath14 with regular hexagons whose sides have length @xmath25 ( so that the centres of hexagons that share an edge are at distance @xmath26 ) .",
    "the vertices of the graph are the centre points of the hexagons .",
    "we connect two vertices if and only if their respective hexagons share an edge .",
    "this way , each vertex has exactly six neighbouring vertices .",
    "we will often use an isomorphic representation of the hexagonal model which will be of importance in the sequel .",
    "this representation has @xmath20 as the set of vertices .",
    "each point @xmath27 has the following neighboring vertices , @xmath28 it may be shown that the two models are isomorphic by using the mapping @xmath29 , which is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "the effect of the mapping on the neighbor set is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hexmodel ] . from now on , slightly changing notation , we will also refer to this representation as the hexagonal model .",
