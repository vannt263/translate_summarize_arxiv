    "the survey papers @xcite point out another important consequence of these two results taken together : _",

    "@xcite from 1962 , which gives a recursive system of inequalities , since the relevant schubert calculus questions can be cast as lower - dimensional littlewood - richardson questions .",
    "the main tool in this paper is the berenstein - zelevinsky cone @xcite , and in particular the bz polytope associated to the triple @xmath0 , in which the number of lattice points is the corresponding littlewood - richardson coefficient .",
    "we use a new description of the bz cone : the _ honeycomb _ model .",
    "( the reader who is willing to grant appendix [ bzappendix ] does not need to absorb separately the definition of the bz cone . )",
    "this is a special case of a general way of producing polyhedra that we dub _",
    "tinkertoy models_. this viewpoint gives us natural ways to interpret faces of the bz polytope as associated to simpler tinkertoys .",
    "in addition , the gel@xmath19fand - cetlin system fits in this theory as associated to a @xmath20-dimensional tinkertoy .",
    "the essence of the proof is as follows .",
    "we introduce a way of indexing ( real ) points in the berenstein - zelevinsky cone by planar pictures called _ honeycomb diagrams _ ; this identification is in appendix [ bzappendix ] .",
    "this rational polyhedral cone linearly projects to the space of triples @xmath0 of ( real ) dominant weights of @xmath1 . by @xcite ,",
    "the number of integral points ( honeycomb diagrams whose vertices lie at points in the triangular lattice ) in a fiber of this projection is the dimension @xmath21 . in order to work conveniently with honeycomb diagrams ,",
    "we introduce the seemingly richer notion of a honeycomb , since honeycombs can be seen to naturally fit into a polyhedral cone .",
    "then we prove the somewhat technical theorem [ picturesdontlie ] that honeycombs are characterized by their diagrams ( whose linear structure is less apparent ) .",

    "the `` largest lift '' , which we prove in theorem [ bigthm ] to have very nice properties if the three weights are suitably generic .",
    "this theorem seems to be the useful one for studying honeycombs , and will play an equally important role in the next paper in this series @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward to prove from its nice properties that the largest lift is integral .",
    "a continuity argument handles the case of nongeneric triples of weights .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "not all of the framework presented in this paper is strictly necessary if one only wishes to prove the saturation conjecture . in the very nice paper",
    "@xcite a streamlined version of our proof is presented , avoiding honeycombs in favor of the hive model ( presented in appendix [ hiveappendix ] ) , and in particular not requiring theorem [ picturesdontlie ] . however , one consequence of theorem [ picturesdontlie ] is that honeycombs have a very important operation called _ overlaying _ which will be central for developments in later papers . in the next in this series we will use the overlaying operation to study which of klyachko s inequalities are in fact essential @xcite .",
    "we thank chris woodward for pointing out that the saturation conjecture gives a new proof of the weak prv conjecture for @xmath1 , which states that @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 in the positive weyl chamber ) is a constituent of @xmath8 .",
    "( this `` conjecture '' is nowadays known to be true for all lie groups @xcite . ) in fact one can do better , and without using saturation ; in section [ sec : overlay ] there is a canonical honeycomb witnessing each instance of the long - proven `` conjecture '' , constructed by overlaying @xmath26-honeycombs .",
    "we mention very briefly some connections to algebraic and symplectic geometry ( much more can be found in @xcite ) . by borel - weil ,",
    "the space @xmath21 is the space of invariant sections of the @xmath0 line bundle on the product of three flag manifolds . given two nonzero invariant sections , one of the @xmath0 line bundle and one of the @xmath27 , we can tensor them together to get an invariant section of the @xmath28 line bundle .",
    "the geometrical fact that the flag manifold ( hence the product ) is reduced and irreducible guarantees that this tensor product section is again nonzero ; this is why the set of triples @xmath0 with invariant sections forms a monoid .",
    "this same data is involved in defining a geometric invariant theory quotient of the product of three flag manifolds by the diagonal action of @xmath1 .",

    "( klyachko s paper is a study of the semistability conditions that arise in performing this quotient . )",
    "the bz counting result then says that this moduli space of triples of flags has the same hilbert function as a certain toric variety , and our saturation result says that the ( by definition ample ) line bundle on this moduli space actually has sections .",
    "w. fulton has shown us examples in which this line bundle is not very ample . _",
    "if _ one had an explicit degeneration of the moduli space to the toric variety , one might be able to relate this non - very - amplitude to the existence of nonintegral vertices on the corresponding polytope of honeycombs .",
    "the symplectic geometry connection then comes from the `` git quotients are symplectic quotients '' theorem @xcite ( whose proof is essentially repeated in klyachko s paper , in this special case ) . in this case , the corresponding symplectic quotient is the space of triples of hermitian matrices with spectra @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 which sum to zero , modulo the diagonal action of @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 in particular , this identification shows directly that the existence of a @xmath1-invariant vector in @xmath4 implies the existence of a triple of hermitian matrices with zero sum .",
    "the reverse implication exactly amounts to the saturation conjecture .",
    "b. sturmfels has pointed out that the `` largest lift '' construction can be interpreted as selecting a vertex of the _ fiber polytope _",
    "@xcite of the projection from the cone of honeycombs to the cone of triples of dominant weights .",
    "combining this idea with the hypothetical degeneration of the moduli space to the bz toric variety , this suggests that we might be able to alternately interpret the largest lift as picking out a point in the _ chow _ quotient @xcite of the product of three flag manifolds by the diagonal action of @xmath1 .",
    "we thank anders buch , bill fulton , bernd sturmfels , greg warrington , and andrei zelevinsky for careful readings and many cogent suggestions ; bill we thank especially for correcting us on a number of historical inaccuracies in the early versions .",
    "we encourage the reader to get a feeling for honeycombs by playing with the honeycomb java applet at    http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~allenk/java/honeycombs.html .",
    "we fix first a few standard notations .",
    "a weight of @xmath1 is a list of @xmath32 integers , and is dominant if the list is weakly decreasing .",

    ".    the space @xmath266 can be thought of as the space of sections of a sheaf on the git quotient @xmath267 ( as explained in the introduction , in the case of @xmath268 ) .",
    "however , this sheaf may not necessarily be a line bundle ; it can have singularities that get worse at orbifold points of the quotient , and any section is required to vanish at the singularities .",
    "the condition that @xmath16 annihilate the center exactly guarantees that this sheaf be a line bundle generically , so is certainly necessary for the existence of nonvanishing sections .",
    "however , if the sheaf has singularities along which any section must vanish , it stands to reason that global sections are less likely to exist .",
    "the condition in the conjecture is exactly equivalent to asking that the sheaf be a line bundle globally , therefore to have a better chance to have sections .    to be sure",
    ", this conjecture is not nearly as satisfactory as the result for @xmath1 ( primarily because it s not necessary , only claimed to be sufficient ) , but the situation for other groups seems to be inherently less clean .",
    "let @xmath269 be a hexagon with @xmath173 angles and two vertical edges .",
    "define the * * torsion of @xmath269 to be the length of the left edge minus that of the right edge .",
    "the torsion of @xmath269 and that of each @xmath173 rotation of @xmath269 agree .    for a regular hexagon",
    "they are all zero .",
    "if one translates one edge of @xmath269 out from the center , the edge shrinks and its two neighboring edges grow , keeping the torsions equal .",
    "any position of the hexagon can be achieved by composing such translations .",
    "let @xmath53 be a @xmath91-honeycomb .",
    "we will assign a number to each region in the @xmath91 honeycomb tinkertoy @xmath104 , other than the sectors at the three corners , using @xmath53 .",
    "this will turn out to be a berenstein - zelevinsky pattern .    1 .",
    "each hexagon is assigned its torsion .",
    "each semiinfinitewedge on the ne long edge of the honeycomb is assigned the length of its west edge .",
    "each semiinfinitewedge on the nw long edge of the honeycomb is assigned the length of its se edge .",
    "each semiinfinitewedge on the bottom long edge of the honeycomb is assigned the length of its ne edge .",
    "( this is set up so as to be @xmath173-rotation invariant . )    for any region not on the nw long edge , the sum of the region - entries at and to the right of that point telescopes to the length of an edge , necessarily nonnegative .",
    "( likewise for @xmath173 rotations . )    to determine the sum across an entire row is a little trickier .",
    "we need to relate the length of an edge to the constant coordinates on neighboring edges .",
    "rotate the edge to align it with the finite edge in figure [ edgelength ] .",
    "so the sum across an entire left - right row , with a semiinfinitewedge at the left end , is    1 .",
    "the sum of the lengths of the two finite edges of that wedge 2 .",
    "the difference of the constant coordinates of the semiinfiniteedges of that wedge .",
    "( by @xmath173-rotational symmetry the same is true for sums in other directions . )",
    "in particular , if the constant coordinates of the semiinfiniteedges are interpreted as the coefficients @xmath270 of three dominant weights ( in nonincreasing order ) as in the rest of the paper , the labeling of the regions exactly matches the definition of * * berenstein - zelevinsky pattern as given in @xcite ( only one of many realizations , others to be found in the original @xcite ) .",
    "the central theorem in @xcite gives a formula for littlewood - richardson coefficients as the number of bz patterns with given boundary values .",
    "their formulation is more suited to @xmath271 than @xmath91 calculations , and as such , they need to include a caveat that bz patterns count the lr coefficient only if the sum of the three weights is in the root lattice of @xmath271 .",
    "( if the sum is not in the root lattice , the lr coefficient is obviously zero , but there are still likely to be many bz patterns which now have no known representation - theoretic meaning . ) in the @xmath91-adapted formulation of this paper this caveat does not appear .    for us ,",
    "the bz theorem reads as follows :    [ bzequiv ] let @xmath3 be a triple of dominant weights of @xmath1 .",
    "then the number of lattice @xmath91-honeycombs whose semiinfiniteedges , indexed clockwise from the southwest , have constant coordinates @xmath116 is the corresponding littlewood - richardson coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "in this section we introduce another model of the points in the berenstein - zelevinsky cone , much closer to the bz models in feel , that has the honeycomb - like property of having only `` local '' inequalities .",
    "it is not strictly necessary for the logic of the paper , but is very useful as an alternate model ; this is particularly true if one wants to actually count tensor product multiplicities , rather than merely prove them positive .",
    "the paper @xcite exposing our work takes this model as the fundamental one .",
    "as was mentioned elsewhere , the primary advantage of the honeycomb model over the original bz models is the naturality of the `` overlay '' operation ; in this paper this is only used in a sort of local way , when we elide simple degeneracies . but this comes with a cost  the linear structure on the space of honeycombs is a bit difficult to see geometrically .",
    "in addition , the degrees of freedom of the honeycomb are distinctly more obscure than in the bz models .",
    "( and then there is the typesetting problem . )    given @xmath45 a honeycomb tinkertoy , recall the dual graph @xmath165 defined in section [ sec : degen ] . define the vector space @xmath272 to be labelings of the vertices of @xmath165 by real numbers .",
    "this vector space naturally contains the lattice of integer labelings .",
    "recall that the embedded graph @xmath165 is a collection of triangles , which we refer to as the * * hive triangles . of most interest to us are the rhombi formed by pairs of adjacent hive triangles .",
    "each such rhombus has two * * acute vertices and two * * obtuse vertices .",
    "there are three possible directions a rhombus may face .",
    "this gives a * * rhombus inequality , asking that the rhombus functional be nonnegative .",
    "the cone in @xmath272 satisfying all these inequalities we denote @xmath274 , and we will call its elements @xmath45-hives .",
    "let @xmath45 be a honeycomb tinkertoy .",
    "then there is a @xmath59-linear correspondence between configurations of @xmath45 , and @xmath45-hives whose leftmost top entry is zero , in such a way that the constant coordinates of the boundary edges of the honeycomb are differences of boundary entries on the corresponding @xmath45-hive .",
    "start with a configuration @xmath53 of @xmath45 .",
    "we label the vertices in @xmath165 inductively , starting with a zero in the leftmost top entry , and filling in as follows : whenever we move southwest or east , we increase the value by the constant coordinate of the edge crossed ; southeast , we decrease by that constant coordinate .",
    "our first worry is that different paths will cause us to try to fill different numbers in the same hexagon . that this does nt happen",
    "is a simple consequence of the sum - equals - zero property at a vertex of the honeycomb .",
    "lastly , since we define the hive entries by inductively adding up constant coordinates of edges , the boundary of the hive naturally ends up being the partial sums of those constant coordinates .",
    "( the sum - equals - zero property is involved in seeing this for some of the boundary edges . )    combining this with the theorem in the appendix relating @xmath91-honeycombs to littlewood - richardson coefficients , we find that if @xmath3 are integral , the number of hives with boundary formed from partial sums of @xmath3 is a littlewood - richardson coefficient .",
    "( in @xcite , there is given a simple bijection between hives and a standard formulation of the littlewood - richardson rule . )",
    "there is a pleasant geometric way to interpret the rhombus inequalities .",
    "extend the hive to a piecewise linear function , affine - linear on each little hive triangle .",
    "then the rhombus inequalities state that this function is convex .",
    "each rhombus _ equality _ says that the function is actually linear across the boundary down the middle of the rhombus , i.e. that the regions on which the function is affine - linear are larger than just the little hive triangles .    in this way",
    ", the set of tight rhombus inequalities determines a certain decomposition of the convex region in @xmath92 bearing @xmath165 into regions ( which we dub `` flatspaces '' due to the geometric interpretation above ) .",
    "this is exactly the decomposition into the regions of the degeneracy graph from section [ sec : degen ] .",
    "we mentioned there that the degeneracy graph remembers only the `` combinatorial information '' about a honeycomb ; we see now that it is the hive that finishes the job ."
