    "incompressibility of nuclear matter , also knows as compressional modulus has a special interest in pure nuclear and astro - nuclear physics , because of its fundamental role in guiding the equation of state ( eos ) for nuclear matter .",
    "compressional modulus @xmath1 can not be measured by any experimental technique directly , rather it depends indirectly on the experimental measurement of isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) for its conformation @xcite .",
    "this fact enriches the demand of correct measurement of excitation energy of isgmr .",
    "the relativistic parameter with random phase approaches ( rpa ) constraint the range of the compressibility modulus @xmath2 mev @xcite for nuclear matter .",
    "similarly , the non - relativistic formalism with hartree - fock ( hf ) plus rpa allows the acceptable range of compressibility modulus @xmath3 mev , which is less than relativistic one .",
    "it is believed that the part of this discrepancy in the acceptable range of compressional modulus comes from the diverse behavior of the density dependence of symmetry energy in relativistic and non - relativistic formalism @xcite .",
    "now , both the relativistic and non - relativistic formalisms come with a general agreement on the value of nuclear compressibility i.e. , @xmath4 mev @xcite .",
    "but the new experiment on @xmath5 isotopic series i.e. , @xmath6 rises the question `` why tin is so fluffy ? ' ' @xcite .",
    "this question again finger towards the correct theoretical investigation of compressibility modulus .",
    "thus , it is worthy to investigate the compressibility modulus in various theoretical formalisms .",
    "most of the relativistic and non - relativistic theoretical models reproduce the strength distribution very well for medium and heavy nuclei , like @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "but at the same time it overestimate the excitation energy of @xmath5 around 1 mev .",
    "this low value of excitation energy demands lower value nuclear matter compressibility .",
    "this gives a new challenge to both the theoretical and experimental nuclear physicsts . till date",
    ", lots of effort have been devoted to solve this problem like inclusion of pairing effect @xcite , mutually enhancement effect ( mem ) etc . @xcite .",
    "but the pairing effect reduces the theoretical excitation energy only by 150 kev in @xmath5 isotopic series , which may not be sufficient to overcome the puzzle .",
    "similarly , new experimental data are not in favor of mem effect@xcite .",
    "measurement on excitation energy of @xmath9 shows that the mem effect should rule out in manifestation of stiffness of the @xmath5 isotopic series .    here ,",
    "in the present work , we use the relativistic thomas - fermi ( rtf ) and relativistic extended thomas - fermi ( retf ) @xcite with scaling and constraint approaches in the frame - work of non - linear @xmath10 model @xcite .",
    "the retf is the @xmath11 correction to the rtf , where variation of density taken care properly mostly in the surface of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the retf formalism is more towards the quantal hartee approximation .",
    "it is also verified that the semiclassical approximation like thomas - fermi method is very useful in calculation of collective property of nucleus , like giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) . in particular , for heavier mass nuclei , it gives almost similar results with the complicated quantal calculation .",
    "this is because of quantal correction are averaged out in heavier mass nuclei and results are inclined toward semiclassical one .",
    "so it is very much instructive to calculate excitation energy of various nucleus by this method and compared with experimental results . since , last one decade , the softness of sn isotopes remain a headache for both theorists and experimentalists , it is worthy to discuss the softness of tin isotopes in semiclassical approximations like retf and rtf .    here",
    ", we calculate the excitation energy of sn isotopes from @xmath12sn to @xmath13sn using the semi - classical rtf and retf model . the different momentum ratio like @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are compared with the scaling and constraint calculations .",
    "the theoretical results are computed in various parameter sets such as nl - sh , nl1 , nl2 ,",
    "nl3 and fsug . we analyzed the predictive power of these parameter sets and discussed various aspects of the compressibility modulus .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in section ii we have summarized the theoretical formalisms , which are useful for the present analysis . in section iii",
    ", we have given the discussions of our results . here",
    ", we have elaborated the giant monopole resonance obtained by various parameter sets and their connectivity with compressibility modulus .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "the principle of scale invariance is used to obtain the virial theorem for the relativistic mean field @xcite theory by working in the relativistic thomas  fermi ( rtf ) and relativistic extended thomas - fermi ( retf ) approximations @xcite .",
    "although , the scaling and constrained calculations are not new , the present technique is developed first time by patra et al @xcite , which is different from other scaling formalisms .",
    "the detail formalisms of the scaling method are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    ", we have outlined briefly some of the essential expressions , which are needed for the present purpose .",
    "we have worked with the non - linear lagrangian of boguta and bodmer @xcite to include the many - body correlation arises from the non - linear terms of the @xmath16meson self - interaction @xcite for nuclear many - body system .",
    "the nuclear matter compressibility modulus @xmath1 also reduces dramatically by the introduction of these terms , which motivates to work with this non - liner lagrangian .",
    "the relativistic mean field hamiltonian for a nucleon - meson interacting system is written by @xcite : @xmath17 \\varphi_i   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ ( \\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2 + m_{s}^2 \\phi^2 \\right ] + \\frac{1}{3 } b \\phi^3\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{4 } c \\phi^4 -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ ( \\vec{\\nabla } v)^2 + m_{v}^2 v^2 \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ ( \\vec{\\nabla } r)^2 + m_\\rho^2 r^2 \\right ] - \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(\\vec{\\nabla }   { \\cal a}\\right)^2 - \\frac { \\zeta_0}{24 } g_{v}^4{v}^4 \\\\   & - & { \\lambda_v } { g_v^2}{g_\\rho}^2{r^2}{v^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the masses for the nucleon ( with @xmath22 being the effective mass of the nucleon ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25mesons , respectively and @xmath26 is the dirac spinor . the field for the @xmath27-meson is denoted by @xmath28 , for @xmath29-meson by @xmath30 , for @xmath31-meson by @xmath32 ( @xmath33 as the @xmath34 component of the isospin ) and for photon by @xmath35 .",

    "we obtain the field equations for the nucleon and mesons . in semi - classical approximation",
    ", we can write the above hamiltonian in term of density as : @xmath42 where @xmath43\\varphi_i,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the free part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the total density @xmath48 is the sum of proton @xmath49 and neutron @xmath50 densities .",
    "the semi - classical ground - state meson fields are obtained by solving the euler ",
    "lagrange equations @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "@xmath53\\ ] ] @xmath54\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath55\\ ] ] @xmath56 the above field equations are solved self - consistently in an iterative method .",
    "@xmath57 with @xmath58 in order to study the monopole vibration of the nucleus we have scaled the baryon density @xcite .",
    "the normalized form of the baryon density is given by @xmath59 @xmath60 is the collective co - ordinate associated with the monopole vibration . as fermi momentum and density are inter - related , the scaled fermi momentum is given by @xmath61^{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly @xmath62 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 and coulomb fields are scaled due to self - consistence eqs .",
    "( 7 - 10 ) .",
    "but the @xmath62 field can not be scaled simply like the density and momentum , because the source term of @xmath63 field contains the @xmath62 field itself . in semi - classical formalism , the energy and density are scaled like @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath65 the symbol @xmath66 shows an implicit dependence of @xmath67 . with all these scaled variables , we can write the hamiltonian as : @xmath68 here we are interested to calculate the monopole excitation energy which is defined as @xmath69 with @xmath70 is the restoring force and @xmath71 is the mass parameter . in our calculations",
    ", @xmath72 is obtained from the double derivative of the scaled energy with respect to the scaled co - ordinate @xmath73 at @xmath74 and is defined as @xcite : @xmath75_{\\lambda=1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the mass parameter @xmath76 of the monopole vibration can be expressed as the double derivative of the scaled energy with the collective velocity @xmath77 as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the displacement field , which can be determined from the relation between collective velocity @xmath77 and velocity of the moving frame , @xmath80 with @xmath81 is the transition density defined as @xmath82 taking @xmath83 . then the mass parameter can be written as @xmath84 . in",
    "non - relativistic limit , @xmath85 and the scaled energy @xmath86 is @xmath87 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be found in @xcite .",
    "along with the scaling calculation , the monopole vibration can also be studied with constrained approach @xcite . in this method",
    ", one has to solve the constrained functional equation : @xmath90=e(\\eta)-\\eta\\int{dr}{r}^2\\rho.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the constrained is @xmath91 .",
    "the constrained energy @xmath92 can be expanded in a harmonic approximation as @xmath93 the second order derivative in the expansion is related with the constrained compressibility modulus for finite nucleus @xmath94 as @xmath95 and the constrained energy @xmath96 as @xmath97 in the non - relativistic approach , the constrained energy is related by the sum rule weighted @xmath98 .",
    "now the scaling and constrained excitation energies of the monopole vibration in terms of the non - relativistic sum rules will help us to calculate @xmath99 , i.e. the resonance width @xcite , @xmath100",
    "it is interesting to apply the model to calculate the excitation energy of sn isotopic series and compared with experimental results .",
    "thus , we calculate the gmr energy using both the scaling and constraint methods in the frame - work of relativistic extended thomas - fermi approximation using various parameter sets for z= 48 and 50 and compared with the excitation energy with momentum ratio @xmath101 and @xmath102 obtained from multipule decomposition analysis ( mda ) . the basic reason to take a number of parameter sets",
    "is that the infinite nuclear matter compressibility of these forces cover a wide range of values .",
    "for example , nl - sh has compressibility 399 mev , while that of nl1 is 210 mev .",
    "from mda analysis we get different momentum ratio , such as @xmath101 , @xmath103 and @xmath102 .",
    "these ratios are connected to scaling , centroid and constraint energies , respectively .",
    "that is why we compared our theoretical scaling result with @xmath104 and @xmath105 with the constrained calculations .",
    "giant monopole excitation energy obtained by scaling method with various parameter sets are compared with experimental @xcite @xmath104 for cd and sn isotopes . ]",
    "same as fig . 1 , but for @xmath105 . ]    in figures 1 and 2 we have shown the @xmath14 and @xmath15 ratio for isotopic chains of cd and sn .",
    "the results are also compared with experimental data obtained from ( rcnp ) . from the figures",
    ", it is cleared that the experimental value lies between the results obtained from fusg ( fsugold ) and nl1 force parameters .",
    "it is to be noted that , throughout the calculations , we have used only the non - linner parameter sets for their excellent prediction of nuclear observables with the experimental data . if one compares the experimental and theoretical results for @xmath106pb , the fsug set gives better results amongst all .",
    "for example , the experimental and theoretical data are 14.17@xmath1070.1 and 14.04 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are well matched with each other . from this",
    ", one could conclude that the infinite nuclear matter compressibility lies nearer to that of fsug ( 230.28 mev ) parameter .",
    "but experimental result on isgm in rcnp shows that the predictive power of fusg is not good enough for the excitation energy of sn isotopes .",
    "this observation is not only confined to rcnp formalism , but also persists in the more sophisticated rpa approach . in table",
    "i , we have given the results for qrpa(t6 ) , retf(fsug ) and retf(nl1 ) .",
    "the experimental data are also given to compare all these theoretical results .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table iv , we have listed the compressibility of some of the selected nuclei in scaling @xmath108 and constraint @xmath109 icalculations .",
    "this results are compared with the computed values obtained from eos model . to evaluate the compressibility from eos",
    ", we have followed the procedure discussed in @xcite .",
    "m. centelles et al @xcite , parameterised the density for finite nucleus as @xmath110 and obtained the asymmetry coefficient @xmath111 of the nucleus with mass a from the eos at this particular density . here",
    "also , we have used the same parametric from of the density and obtained the compressibility of finite nucleus from the eos .",
    "for example , @xmath112 for @xmath113 in fsug parameter set .",
    "we have calculated the compressibility from the eos at this particular density , which comes around 145 mev .",
    "we have also calculated the compressibility independently in thomas - fermi and extended thomas - fermi using scaling and constraint calculations , which are 161 mev and 146.1 mev , respectively .",
    "in summary , we analysed the predictive power of various force parameters , like nl1 , nl2 , nl3 , nl - sh and fsug in the frame - work of relativistic thomas - fermi and relativistic extended thomas - fermi approaches for giant monopole excitation energy of sn - isotopes . the calculation",
    "is then extended to some other relevant nuclei .",
    "the analysis shows that thomas - fermi approximation gives better resluts than pairing+mem data .",
    "it exactly reproduces the experimental data for sn isotopes , when the compressibility of the force parameter is within @xmath0 mev .",
    "we also concluded that a parameter set can reproduce the excitation energy of sn isotopes , if its infinite nuclear matter compressibility lies within @xmath0 mev , however , fails to reproduce the gmr data for other nuclei within the same accuracy .",
    "we have qualitatively analized the difference in gmr energies retf - rtf using retf and rtf formalisms in various force parameters .",
    "the fsugold parameter set shows different behavior from all other forces .",
    "also , extended our calculations of monopole excitation energy for sn isotopes with a force parametrization having softer symmetry energy ( nl3 + @xmath114 ) .",
    "the excitation energy decreses with the increse of proton - neutron asymetry agreeing with the experimental trend . in conclusion , after all these thorough analysis , it seems that the softening of sn isotopes is an open problem for nuclear theory and more work in this direction are needed .",
