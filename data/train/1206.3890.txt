    "formally , such a steady - state configuration requires that , in the unperturbed system , cooling is perfectly balanced by heat conduction , which appears like an artificial and unrealistic assumption .",
    "however , the steady - state solution can be interpreted more broadly as describing a `` quasi - stationary '' state , which does not evolve significantly over the timescales of interest and is close to hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium .",

    "we assume that there is no meridional circulation in the background fluid . in principle",
    "the velocity components @xmath35 and @xmath36 could be non - null , even in the absence of meridional circulation , because a time - independent subsonic inflow of gas can occur if cooling is not perfectly balanced by thermal conduction ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "however , for simplicity , in the present investigation we limit ourselves to the case @xmath37 .",
    "it must be noted that the poincar - wavre theorem @xcite , which holds for unmagnetized fluids , applies also to our model of magnetized plasma , as long as the magnetic field is dynamically unimportant in the unperturbed configuration ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "a useful relation among unperturbed quantities is the vorticity equation , which is derived from the momentum equations and , under the above hypotheses , can be written as @xmath43 as we have assumed that there are no motions in the meridional plane ( @xmath37 ) , _ in the hypothesis that all components of the background magnetic fields are time - independent _ the induction equation implies that the unperturbed system satisfies ferraro s isorotation law @xcite @xmath44 i.e. the angular velocity is constant along field lines ( see equation  [ eq : indphi ] ) .",

    "so it is possible to consider a more general unperturbed weak - field configuration , in which condition  ( [ eq : ferraro ] ) is not satisfied , @xmath46 depends on time , while all the other unperturbed quantities ( including @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) are time - independent : the results of the perturbation analysis are still valid in this case , provided the dispersion relation does not depend on @xmath46 .",

    "the linear analysis is intended to be taken locally in the plasma , in the sense that the perturbation wavelength is much shorter than the characteristic scalelengths of the unperturbed system .",
    "we further assume that the perturbation frequency is much lower than the sound - wave frequency , so we work in the boussinesq approximation to exclude a priori the ( stable ) modes describing the sound waves . in linearizing the thermal conduction term , it is useful to note that the linear perturbation of the heat flux , in the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation , is @xmath56,\\ ] ] where we have introduced the dimensionless vectors @xmath57 and @xmath58 . from the above expression ,",

    "the first term in the right - hand side of equation is similar to what is obtained in the case of unmagnetized heat flux ( equation  [ eq : scalartc ] ) , but accounts for the relative orientation of the displacement and the unperturbed magnetic field .",

    "specifically , in all cases for stability the fluid is required to be field - stable ( @xmath195 ) , barotropic , with outward increasing angular velocity ( @xmath308 ) .",
    "additional requirements concern the relative orientation of the magnetic field lines and the thermal gradient ( which must be either parallel or orthogonal ) and the gradient of temperature with respect to pressure ( which has different effects , depending on the relative orientation of the field lines and the thermal gradient ) .",
    "the above conditions can be seen as a combination and generalization of criteria for stability against the mri @xcite , the mti @xcite , the hbi @xcite and the radiatively driven overstability of @xcite .",
    "as well known , even just the two conditions @xmath195 and @xmath309 are typically not satisfied in standard astrophysical conditions , so we expect always to find at least one axisymmetric mode that is either monotonically unstable or overstable .",
    "therefore , at a formal level , we must conclude that _ a radiatively cooling , rotating , weakly magnetized astrophysical plasma is not expected to be stable against axisymmetric perturbations_. similar conclusions were reached for magnetized ( but non rotating ) fluids by @xcite and for rotating ( but unmagnetized ) fluids by : in both cases either overstabilities or monotonic growing instabilities were expected for typical configurations . in other words ,",
    "the calculations of the present paper have shown that the combination of differential rotation and a weak ordered magnetic field does not have a stabilizing effect against thermal axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "in addition to the above results on thermal stability , we have also generalized previous studies of the stability of magnetized media in the absence of radiative cooling : in particular we have extended the study of @xcite , by allowing for the presence of non - isothermal unperturbed field lines , and the study of @xcite , by including the effect of differential rotation ( sections  [ sec : nocoolnobphi ] and [ sec : nocoolbphi ] ) .",
    "the bottom line of such an analysis is that isothermality of the unperturbed field lines is a necessary requirement for stability if the magnetic field has non - vanishing azimuthal component , but , when the magnetic field is meridional , stable configurations are formally possible also with ( non - isothermal ) field lines orthogonal to the isobaric surfaces . in any case",
    ", the general conclusion is that , _ even in the absence of cooling , either overstability or monotonic instability is expected _ , because some of the conditions for stability are very unlikely to be satisfied in real systems ( e.g. , @xmath310 in the barotropic case ) . formally the conditions for stability are more restrictive when cooling is effective : while in the presence of cooling the distribution must necessarily be barotropic in order to be stable , in the absence of cooling it is possible , at least in principle , to have baroclinic distributions stable against axisymmetric perturbations . however ,",
    "these configurations are unlikely to be astrophysically relevant , because of the requirement of outward increasing angular velocity .",
    "therefore it appears that _ radiative cooling is not the key factor determining the instability of a rotating magnetized plasma . _      at a formal level , the above conclusions are the main results of the present work .",
    "a quite different question is what these results imply from the astrophysical point of view : in particular , what are the implications for the evolution of the hot atmospheres of galaxies and galaxy clusters ?",
    "we recall that the basic underlying question is whether cool clouds can condense out of a hot , stratified medium as a consequence of the instability . to answer this question",
    "one must necessarily go beyond the formal conclusion that linear instability is expected and try to investigate the nature of the instabilities ( monotonically growing or overstable ) , their non - linear evolution and the dependence on the properties of the perturbation .",
    "unfortunately , we can not address quantitatively these points based only on the presented calculations , but it is worth discussing them at least qualitatively .    as first pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "an important aspect of the problem is the study of the unstable modes , and , in particular , determining the nature of the instabilities : while monotonically growing instabilities are expected to naturally lead to condensation , overstable disturbances are half the time overdense and half the time underdense , with respect to the local background , so they are likely disrupted by turbulence before condensing significantly @xcite .",
    "the problem of the nature of the instabilities found in the present work could in principle be tackled analytically by studying the sign of the real roots of the dispersion relations , but , as mentioned in appendix  [ app : rh ] , given the high order of the involved polynomials the calculations are prohibitively cumbersome ( @xcite , and references therein ) . though a full exploration of the parameter space is impractical , in selected cases the question of the nature of the thermal instabilities can be addressed either by solving numerically the dispersion relations derived in this work or with magnetohydrodynamics numerical simulations , which can also be used to gain insight on the non - linear evolution of linearly unstable perturbations . for the non - rotating case , an attempt in this direction has been recently made by @xcite : the results of their somewhat idealized magnetohydrodynamics simulations suggest that no significant condensation occurs in the relevant regime in which the cooling time is much longer than the dynamical time .",
    "it must be noted that all the stability criteria reported in the present work concern stability against axisymmetric perturbations . in principle , configurations that are stable against axisymmetric perturbations could be unstable when more general ( non - axisymmetric ) perturbations are considered .",
    "therefore , from a mathematical point of view , exploring different kinds of disturbances could just lead to even more restrictive stability criteria .",
    "however , from the astrophysical point of view , it is clear that an axisymmetric mode is not necessarily relevant to real disturbances , and a natural question to ask is whether the instability occurs also for possibly more relevant non - axisymmetric perturbations . as well known , in the presence of differential rotation , it is considerably more complex to study non - axisymmetric than axisymmetric perturbations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such a task is beyond the purpose of the present paper .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that , _ at least in the unmagnetized case , non - axisymmetric perturbations tend to be stabilized by differential rotation _ , while this is not the case for axisymmetric disturbances .    throughout the paper we have assumed that the magnetic field is ordered over scales larger than the perturbation size .",
    "the above - presented calculations show that , if this is the case , the fluid is unlikely to stable , at least against axisymmetric disturbances .",
    "it is hard to predict the outcome of such instability , but in any case we should expect that also the structure of the magnetic field is affected .",
    "if turbulent motions are produced by the instability , the ( weak ) magnetic field is likely tangled by turbulence , and the system might end up in a configuration which is better described by an unmagnetized medium with suppressed isotropic thermal conductivity @xcite , so that the results of should apply .",
    "however , it is also possible that , as a consequence of the instability , the fluid rearranges the magnetic field lines in a special ordered configuration that tends to contrast the instability , possibly leading to an overstable state @xcite . in the absence of realistic non - linear calculations",
    "it appears difficult to decide which of the two above hypotheses is a better description of real systems , and of course alternative scenarios are not excluded .",
    "overall , as far as the astrophysical implications are concerned , the results of the present work , though not allowing us to draw general conclusions on whether cool gas clouds can condense spontaneously out of an equilibrium plasma , strongly suggest that _ the interplay of rotation and magnetic fields is important for the thermal instability _",
    ", thus encouraging further theoretical and observational investigations of the magnetic and rotational properties of the hot atmospheres of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",

    "the dispersion relations obtained from our linear - perturbation analysis are polynomials in the complex variable @xmath311 , whose coefficients are real and generally depend on the wavevector @xmath112 . to obtain the linear - stability criterion we need to find the conditions under which the dispersion relation is stable for all wavevectors . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", this problem reduces to studying the stability of families of polynomials of a complex variable with real parametric coefficients .",
    "we recall here the _ routh - hurwitz theorem _ , which is a fundamental tool for studying the stability of polynomials of a complex variable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "let us consider an @xmath312-th degree polynomial @xmath313 where @xmath314 and @xmath315 : @xmath316 is said to be a _",

    ", if all its ( generally complex ) roots have negative real part . let us associate with the polynomial @xmath316 the following _ hurwitz determinants _ : @xmath317 where it has been set @xmath318 for @xmath319 .",
    "the routh - hurwitz theorem states that when @xmath320 for @xmath321 , the polynomial @xmath316 is stable if and only if all hurwitz determinants are strictly positive : @xmath322 a corollary of the theorem is that , under the same hypotheses , a necessary condition for @xmath316 to be stable is that all its real coefficients be strictly positive ; i.e. @xmath323 .",
    "it must be stressed that when at least one of the hurwitz determinants is null the routh - hurwitz theorem does not apply . in our application to the dispersion relations the coefficients of the polynomial are parametric and it is not generally the case that all the hurwitz determinants are non - null .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for stability , we proceed as follows .",
    "we first find the conditions to have @xmath324 for all wavevectors . at this stage",
    "these conditions must be considered necessary , but not sufficient , because it is not guaranteed that the singular cases ( @xmath325 for at least one @xmath326 ) are stable .",
    "we then consider separately the dispersion relations obtained in the singular cases , thus obtaining additional stability conditions that , combined with those obtained from  ( [ eq : deltageq ] ) , give the necessary and sufficient stability criterion .",
    "when the criterion for stability is not met , one is interested in determining whether the unstable modes are monotonically growing ( @xmath33 is real and positive ) or overstable ( @xmath33 is complex , with positive real part ) . mathematically this requires a complete root classification of polynomials with real parametric coefficients .",
    "this task , which can be easily accomplished for third - order polynomials such as those considered in , is extremely complex for the higher - order polynomials we deal with in this work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
