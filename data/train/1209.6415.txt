    "rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection , which is a fluid layer heated from below and cooled from the top , is an idealized model to study turbulent flows involving heat transport and has attracted much attention during the past few decades @xcite .",
    "the system is characterized by two control parameters : the rayleigh number @xmath0 , prandtl number @xmath23 , which are defined as @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . here",
    "@xmath26 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath27 the gravitational acceleration , @xmath28 the temperature difference between the bottom and the top plates , @xmath29 the height of the fluid layer between the plates , @xmath30 the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath31 the thermal diffusivity of the convecting fluid . in addition , the aspect ratio @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the lateral dimension of the system ) also plays an important role in the structures and dynamics of the flow .    in a fully developed rayleigh - bnard turbulent flow , most of the imposed temperature difference",
    "is localized in the thermal boundary layers near the surface of the top and bottom plates , within which heat is transported via conduction @xcite .",
    "the velocity field has the same character : velocity gradient is localized in a thin layer near the plates , which is called viscous boundary layer .",
    "turbulent flow in the central region of the rb cell is approximately homogenous and isotropic@xcite .",
    "as the top and bottom boundary layers contribute the main resistance to heat transfer through the cell and thus dominantly determine the nusselt number , they deserve special attention .",
    "indeed , nearly all theories in rb convection are in essence boundary - layer ( bl ) theories .",
    "for example , a turbulent bl was assumed in the early marginal stability theory @xcite and also in the models by @xcite and @xcite and by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a prandtl - blasius ( pb ) type laminar bl was assumption in the grossmann & lohse ( gl ) theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , direct characterization of the bl properties is essential for testing and differentiating the various theoretical models , and will also provide insight into the physical nature of turbulent heat transfer .",
    "one of the earlier measurements of temperature and also velocity profiles in turbulent rb convection was taken by @xcite in water ( @xmath34 ) at the fixed @xmath35 and at a fixed lateral position .",
    "@xcite extended these measurements over the range @xmath36 in compressed gas ( air ) at room temperature ( pr=0.7 ) , but still at fixed lateral position .",
    "@xcite measured the mean temperature profiles at various horizontal positions on the lower plate of a cylindrical convection cell , the result shows that the thermal layer thickness @xmath37 varied over the plate for the same @xmath0 , and the thinnest bl is closed to the center of the plate .",
    "@xcite found similar results for a cubic cell .",
    "@xcite measured high - resolution temperature profiles in rayleigh - bnard convection near the top plate of a cylindrical container with air ( @xmath38 ) as the working fluid .",
    "their result shows that the thermal bl thickness @xmath39 in the cell with @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite found that the thermal boundary layer thickness scales with @xmath41 in a rectangular cell , at @xmath42 and @xmath0 ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "for the velocity measurement , the methods for determining the velocity profiles near the solid walls of the cell are developed in recent years .",
    "since strong temperature fluctuations exist in rayleigh - bnard convection , the well - established hot - wire anemometry could not be applied to this system . for the viscous boundary layer ,",
    "the large temperature fluctuations make conventional laser doppler velocimetry ineffective because the temperature fluctuations cause fluctuations in the refractive index of the fluid that in turn make it difficult to steadily focus two laser beams to cross each other in the fluid @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced an electrochemical labeling method and measured the velocity profile and boundary layer thickness near the top plate of a cubic cell filled with water , but only at a single value of @xmath0 . in a later study , @xcite developed an indirect method  the correspondence between the peak position of the cutoff frequency profile of the temperature power spectrum and the peak position of the velocity  to infer the viscous boundary boundary layer thickness in gaseous convection .",
    "this method has subsequently been used to infer the viscous layer in thermal convection in mercury @xcite .",
    "it may just be that the method works in certain situations , but there is no theoretical basis for it .",
    "@xcite , using a novel light - scattering technique developed by @xcite , conducted the first direct systematic measurement of velocity profiles in rb convection in a cylindrical cell as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "they found @xmath45 from the velocity profile above the center of the lower plate .",
    "@xcite extended these measurements to convection in cubic cells , finding the same scaling exponent @xmath46 at the bottom plate , but at the sidewall a different result @xmath47 . using various organic liquids , @xcite explored the @xmath23 dependence , finding @xmath48 . with the measured @xmath49 scaling relationship @xmath50 obtained in these studies ( in fact , it was the peclet number @xmath51 rather than @xmath10 in some of these studies ; please see @xcite for more detailed discussions ) , the above results imply a scaling relation @xmath52 . in recent years",
    ", the technique of particle image velocimetry ( piv ) has been introduced to the experimental study of thermal convection @xcite .",
    "@xcite further applied the piv technique to study the viscous bl in a rectangular cell .",
    "their results show that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which showed that the viscous bl in thermal turbulence has the same @xmath10-scaling as a prandtl - blasius laminar bl .",
    "this result validates the laminar bl assumption made in the gl model in a scaling sense .",
    "thus it appears there is a discrepancy in the measured scaling exponent of @xmath55 with respect to @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ) between those obtained in cylindrical and cubic cells and that obtained in rectangular cells . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that because of the more complicated flow dynamics of the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) , such as the azimuthal motion in the cylindrical cell @xcite and the secondary flows in the cubic cell @xcite , the shear flow near the plates is less steady as compared to that in the rectangular cell which is more close to quasi - two - dimension ( quasi-2d ) . as the viscous boundary is created by the shear of the lsc , this may plausibly change the bl properties , resulting in a different exponent .",
    "however , the above argument has not been substantiated experimentally .",
    "part of the motivation of the present work is to determine how the three - dimensional lsc dynamics will affect the bl properties .",
    "it is known that titling the cell by a small angle will `` lock '' the lsc in a fixed azimuthal plane in the sense that it will limit the range of the lsc s azimuthal meandering @xcite and reduce its azimuthal oscillation amplitude near the top and bottom plates of the cell @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we present measurements of bl properties in a cylindrical cell with the cell titled over a range of angles . for small titling angles ,",
    "we measure a boundary layer under a more steady shear comparing to the  leveled \" case when the lsc can freely meander in the azimuthal direction but presumably the bl is otherwise unperturbed under such a small titling angle ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we also examine how the bl scaling exponent and other bl properties behave when the titling angle becomes not so small ( @xmath57 ) , which would amount to a perturbation to the bls .",
    "boundary layers play such an important role in turbulent thermal convection , it is therefore important to examine how bls respond to external perturbations .",
    "understanding the stability or instability of bls is also relevant to the search for the so - called ultimate state of thermal convection , as the transition from the  classical state \" to the ultimate one is essentially an instability transition of the bl from being laminar to being turbulent .",
    "in addition to the scaling of the bl thickness , the shape of the velocity profile near the top and bottom plates has attracted a lot of attention recently . although the bl has been found scaling wise to be of prandtl - blasius type ( at least in the quasi-2d case ) ,",
    "the time - averaged velocity profiles are found to differ with the theoretically predicted one @xcite , especially for the region around the thermal bl .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed a dynamic scaling method that shows that the mean velocity profile measured in the laboratory frame can be brought into coincidence with the theoretical prandtl - blasius laminar bl profile , if it is resampled relative to the time - dependent frame that fluctuates with the instantaneous bl thickness .",
    "this method was tested initially for the case of velocity profile in turbulent convection in a quasi-2d rectangular cell with water as working fluid ( @xmath58 ) . in a follow - up study using two - dimensional dns data",
    ", @xcite found that the method is also valid for thermal boundary layers and for the case of @xmath59 as well .",
    "more recently , these authors further shown , again using numerical data , that the method works also in other positions in the horizontal plate other than the central axis @xcite and in three - dimension ( 3d ) cylindrical cell for moderate values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite , both using numerical approaches , have found that dynamic scaling works less well in the 3d cylindrical geometry than in the quasi-2d case .",
    "however , the method has not been tested experimentally so far in a 3d system . here",
    "we would like to examine the dynamical scaling method using the experimentally obtained instantaneous velocity profiles in our three - dimensional cylindrical cell .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and measurement instrumentation in  [ sec : apparatus ] and present and analyze experimental results in  [ sec : result ] , which are divided into six subsections . in ",
    "[ subsec : thermalbl ] we present the measured temperature profiles and corresponding position - dependent fluid properties , which will be used to calculate the viscous and reynolds stresses . in ",

    "we summarize our findings and conclude in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the measurements were made in a cylindrical rayleigh - bnard convection cell , which has been described in detail previously @xcite .",
    "here we give only its essential features .",
    "the top and bottom conducting plates are made of pure copper with a thin layer of nickel to avoid oxidation .",
    "the sidewall is made of plexiglas . to avoid distortions in the images viewed by the camera , a square - shaped jacket",
    "is fitted around the sidewall of the convection cell .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : setupforpiv](b ) , the jacket is filled with water .",
    "the diameter and height of the cell is @xmath61 cm and @xmath62 cm , respectively .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath63 is thus close to @xmath64 .",
    "two ( three ) thermistors are embedded in the top ( bottom ) plate .",
    "the top plate temperature is maintained constant by a refrigerated circulator ( polyscience model 9702 ) that has a temperature stability of @xmath65 .",
    "a nichrome wire ( 26 gauge , aerocon systems ) surrounded by fiberglass sleeving and teflon tape is distributed inside the grooves carved under the bottom plate .",
    "the wire is connected with five dc power supplies ( ge model gps-3030 ) in series to provide constant and uniform heating . during the measurement , the whole cell",
    "is placed in a homemade thermostat box that is kept at the same temperature ( @xmath66 ) as that of the fluid at the centre of the cell . during the experiment",
    "the cell was tilted by an angle @xmath2 such that the circulation plane of the lsc was parallel to the image plane of the camera ( the @xmath67-@xmath68 plane , see figure 1 ) .",
    "the application of piv to thermal turbulence has been described in detail in several previous publications @xcite .",
    "here we only provide details concerning the particular features of the present experiment .",
    "the piv system consists of one ccd camera with @xmath69 pixels , a dual pulse nd - yag laser with @xmath70 mj per pulse , a synchronizer and software .",
    "as the cell was titled , both the ccd and the laser light - sheet were titled accordingly with the same angle .",
    "a 105 mm focal - length macro lens was attached to the ccd to achieve a measuring area with size varying from @xmath71 mm@xmath72 to @xmath73 mm@xmath72 .",
    "each 2d velocity vector is calculated from a subwindow ( 32 pixels @xmath74 32 pixels ) that has 50@xmath75 overlap with its neighboring subwindows , so each vector corresponds to a region of 16 pixels @xmath74 16 pixels and each velocity map contains @xmath76 velocity vectors in the @xmath67-@xmath68 plane ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this corresponds to spatial resolutions of about @xmath77 mm@xmath72 to @xmath78 mm@xmath72 for velocities @xmath79 and @xmath80 measured in the horizontal @xmath67 and vertical @xmath68 directions , respectively . for the measurement at @xmath81 particles with diameter @xmath82 m were used , while particles with diameter of @xmath83 m were used for measurements with other three tilted angles . for each run , typically about 25200 image pairs were acquired with frame rate of @xmath84 hz .",

    "piv measurements were made at four values of the titling angle @xmath2 @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath6 .",
    "for each @xmath2 , measurements over a range of @xmath0 were made .",
    "table  [ table : parameters ] lists the parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath23 ) of each measurement , which typically lasted for about 3.5 hours .",
    "as already mentioned , titling the cell by a small angle has the effect of  locking \" the lsc s circulation plane at a fixed azimuthal angle ( in reality it restricts the angular range of the lsc s azimuthal meandering ) .",
    "thus , measurements made with small @xmath2 are aimed at studying bl properties under more steady shear , but the bl itself is assumed to be unperturbed otherwise . for large values of @xmath2",
    "we wish to examine how the bl responds to relatively large perturbations .",
    ".control parameters of the experiment : cell tilt angle @xmath2 , the rayleigh number @xmath0 and the prandtl number @xmath23 ; and the measured maximum horizontal velocity @xmath90 and viscous boundary layer thickness @xmath9 .",
    "the data are listed in chronological order . [",

    "the lines are power law fits @xmath91 and @xmath92 to the respective data sets , with the fitting results listed in table  [ tab : table2 ] . ]    in addition to the boundary layer thickness @xmath9 determined from the mean horizontal velocity profile , another length scale can also be defined based on the profile of the horizontal r.m.s .",
    "velocity @xmath93 , which may be called the r.m.s . velocity boundary layer thickness , as defined in figure  [ fig : tofindthickness ] . in figures  [ fig : delta - rms - vs - re - rms](a ) and ( b ) we plot @xmath60 versus @xmath0 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the @xmath0-scaling exponent varies from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , which appears to follow similar trend as that of @xmath9 , i.e. its absolute value increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "but it and that of @xmath13-scaling exponent show significant difference with those obtained in previous studies . table  [ tab : table2 ] shows the fitting results of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "now we compare our result with previous experimental results obtained in the cells with different geometries .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : table2 ] , the value of @xmath98 obtained in both cylindrical and cubic geometries and measured near the bottom plate of the cell is @xmath46 . in all these previous measurements ,",
    "the reynolds number based on the maximum horizontal velocity near the plate was also obtained and they gave a scaling exponent @xmath99 via @xmath100 .",
    "from this we obtain @xmath101 . in these studies ,",
    "the convection cell was nominally leveled , i.e. not intensionally tilted . in the present study , for the small tilting angle cases , where we assume the bl is not strongly perturbed , the measured @xmath102 when combined with combined with @xmath103 give a @xmath104 ( note that the actual value of @xmath105 are obtained from fitting the @xmath9 vs @xmath10 data , not from the relationship between the exponents ) .",
    "if we take these values to be close to the prandtl - blasius result , then scaling wise the viscous bl in a cylindrical geometry is also of a prandtl - blasius type , as was already found in a rectangular cell @xcite .",
    "for the relatively large deviations found in the untilted case , it may be attributed to the random azimuthal motion of the lsc .",
    "finally we remark that as far as the scaling of the viscous bl is concerned , there is no theoretical prediction for the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath0 , only that on @xmath10 ( for example , @xmath106 for the prandtl - blasius bl ) . in the literature",
    ", it is sometimes stated that @xmath9 should scale as @xmath107 for the prandtl - blasius bl .",
    "this is based on the assumption that @xmath108 . from above",
    "we have seen that the scaling exponent of @xmath10 with @xmath0 varies over a rather wide range .",
    "it is therefore more meaningful to talk about the scaling of @xmath9 with @xmath10 , rather than with @xmath0 .",
    "we further note that in @xcite it was found that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which together give @xmath111 . in the present case",
    ", we have @xmath112 and @xmath12 , which together give @xmath11 .",

    "the circles represent those for the horizontal velocity component @xmath79 and the crosses represent those for the vertical velocity component @xmath80 . ]    in previous bl measurements in the cylindrical cell , owing to the nature of the dual - beam incoherent cross - correlation technique employed @xcite , only time - averaged velocity profiles are measured and no time - dependent quantities are obtained .",
    "it is therefore interesting to examine these quantities and compare them with similar quantities obtained in other type of turbulent flows .",
    "figure  [ fig : different ] shows the time series of both the horizontal component @xmath120 ( left panel ) and the vertical component @xmath113 ( right panel ) of the velocity , measured at various positions from the plate .",
    "the corresponding velocity histograms are shown in figure  [ fig : different - histogram ] .",
    "the measurements were made at @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we show the velocity trace at several typical positions : ( i ) inside the thermal boundary layer , ( ii ) around the thermal boundary layer , ( iii ) around the viscous boundary layer ; ( iv ) at the position of the maximum velocity ; and ( v ) far away from the boundary layers .",
    "the figures show that the absolute horizontal velocity is much higher than vertical velocity at each position .",
    "one general feature we observed is that velocity time series and histograms look similar for different tilting angles .",
    "for this reason , we show here results for only one tilting angle .    at @xmath114 ,",
    "the viscous bl thickness is @xmath121 mm .",
    "it is seen from figures  [ fig : different](a ) and  [ fig : different](b ) that at positions inside the bl , the horizontal velocity @xmath120 skews toward the positive side , i.e. the velocity is skewed toward the mean flow direction .",
    "this may be understood by the fact that close to the viscous sublayer the flow speed is very close to zero and a fluctuation smaller than the mean would mean a flow reversal , which is a rather rare event .",
    "once outside of the bl , one observes more symmetric fluctuations around the mean velocity . for the vertical velocity @xmath113 , its mean velocity is very small at most positions .",
    "but the fluctuation increases significantly when the position is outside of the bl , which are signatures of plume emissions at these positions .",
    "these properties can also be seen from the velocity histograms shown in figure  [ fig : different - histogram ] .",
    "a notable difference of the present results from those observed in @xcite is that for positions outside of the bl the horizontal velocity fluctuates more or less symmetrically around the mean , rather than skewed toward the negative as seen in the rectangular cell .",
    "the statistical properties of the velocity may be characterized more quantitatively by its root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "value and its skewness , which are shown in figure  [ fig : rmsnormalized ] .",

    "near the plate , it is seen that the reynolds stress @xmath126 is close to zero , while the viscous shear stress @xmath125 is maximum because of the large velocity gradient @xmath139 at the wall .",
    "so the total stress at the wall @xmath140 comes almost entirely from the contribution of the viscous shear stress .",

    "it is also seen clearly from the figure that @xmath126 and @xmath125 cross at @xmath141 , where @xmath126 is close to its maximum value .",
    "this suggests that the momentum transfer in the outer region is dominated by turbulent fluctuations .",
    "but in the viscous boundary layer , the momentum transfer is still dominated by the viscous diffusion , which implies that the viscous boundary layer is still laminar in this range of @xmath0 .    with the measured near - wall high - resolution velocity field , we are now in a position to check the dynamic wall properties in turbulent thermal convection .",

    "but it has not been examined in 3d experiments . here",
    "we investigate how it works in our cylindrical geometry . as the method",
    "has been well documented elsewhere @xcite , we will only give a brief description of it here .",
    "from the measured instantaneous velocity profile @xmath183 one can obtain an instantaneous viscous boundary layer thickness @xmath184 using the same ` slope ' method as used for the mean velocity profiles . a local dynamical bl frame",
    "can then be constructed by defining the time - dependent rescaled distance @xmath185 from the plate as @xmath186 the dynamically time averaged mean velocity profile @xmath187 in the dynamical bl frame is then obtained by averaging over all values of @xmath183 that were measured at different discrete times @xmath188 but at the same relative position @xmath189 , i.e. @xmath190    figure  [ fig : profile-6e+8 ] shows the mean velocity profiles measured in the laboratory and the dynamical frames respectively at the four tilting angles and for comparable values of @xmath0 ( as indicated in the figure caption ) .",
    "these results show that the dynamical scaling method appears to be more effective for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "this may be understood based on the fact that a larger tilt angle will place stronger restriction on the azimuthal meandering of the lsc so that it has less fluctuations in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the mean flow .",
    "we note , however , regardless of the tilt angle , the method works less effectively than it is in quasi-2d experiment and 2d simulations .",
    "a more quantitative approach to characterize the shape of the mean velocity profiles is to investigate their shape factor @xmath191 defined as the ratio between the displacement thickness @xmath9 and the momentum thickness @xmath192 , where @xmath193dz , ~\\protect{and}~   \\delta_{m}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}[1-\\frac{u(z)}{u_{max}}]\\frac{u(z)}{u_{max}}dz.\\ ] ] since @xmath174 decays after reaching its maximum value , the above integrations are evaluated only over the range from @xmath194 to where @xmath195 . for our profiles",
    "the obtained shape factors range between @xmath196 to @xmath197 , which are smaller than @xmath198 , the value for a laminar prandtl - blasius boundary layer . a shape factor smaller than the theoretical value means the corresponding profile will approach its asymptotic value ( the maximum velocity ) slower than the theoretical profile does .    in figure",
    "[ fig : h - four - angles ] we show the shape factor @xmath29 for mean velocity profiles obtained in the laboratory and dynamical frames respectively for the four tilting angles and for all @xmath0 measured .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure indicate the prandtl - blasius value of 2.59 .",
    "it is seen that , despite the data scatter , there is a general trend that for both lab- and dynamical - frame profiles the deviation from the prandtl - blasius profile increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this is no surprise , since , as the convective flow above the bl becomes more turbulent with increasing @xmath0 , the bl itself will experience stronger fluctuations and hence larger deviations from the laminar case .",
    "this finding that the dynamical rescaling method works better for smaller ra than larger ones is consistent with those found in dns studies in the same geometry by @xcite for the temperature profile and by @xcite and by @xcite for the velocity profile .",
    "the second feature is that for all @xmath2 and @xmath0 the profiles obtained in the dynamical frame in general show some degree of improvement towards that of prandtl - blasius value as compared to those obtained in the laboratory frame .",
    "we also note that the  degree of improvement does not seem to have an obvious dependence on @xmath0 , which is also consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "some insight can be obtained by examining the rescaled instantaneous velocity profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig:1degree-6e+8-instantaneous ] show examples of rescaled instantaneous velocity profiles , where the distance from the plate has been normalized by the instantaneous bl thickness corresponding to that moment and the velocity has been normalized by the instantaneous maximum horizontal velocity .",
    "it is seen that there are quite few cases where the rescaled instantaneous velocity profile is rather close to the theoretical prandtl - blasius profile ( up to the point of the maximum velocity ) and deviations of the instantaneous shape are likely caused by distubances such as plume emissions .",
    "also shown in the figure are the shape factor @xmath199 of these instantaneous profiles . to quantify how the instantaneous profiles are distributed with respect to the prandtl - blasius profile , we examine the pdf of the shape factor difference @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "figure  [ fig : deltah - pdf ] plots the pdfs of @xmath202 for the 4 tilting angles and for all measured @xmath0 respectively . despite the seemingly large variations among them ,",
    "these pdfs show the general trend that the rescaled instantaneous profiles measured at lower values of @xmath0 ( @xmath203 ) are more of the time having a shape closer to that of the prandtl - blasius profile and that for higher values of @xmath0 the peak of the pdfs shift to smaller values of @xmath29 .",
    "this indicates that with increasing @xmath0 the profiles around the bl thickness becomes more rounded , i.e. the approach to the maximum velocity becomes slower and slower .",
    "we further note that these general trends are true across all tilt angles .",
    "another feature observed in the present 3d case is that we did not find any strong correlation between the instantaneous bl thickness @xmath9 and the velocity @xmath120 just above the bl .",
    "this is in contrast to the finding in the quasi-2d experiment where @xmath9 and @xmath120 are found to have a strong negative correlation , i.e. a large velocity above would exert a stronger shear and therefore thins the bl thickness @xcite .",
    "this result suggest that in certain aspect the bls in the 3d and in the 2d / quais-2d cases are dynamically different .",
    "we have conducted an experimental study of velocity boundary layer properties in turbulent thermal convection .",
    "high - resolution two - dimensional velocity field was measured using the particle image velocimetry ( piv ) technique in a cylindrical cell of height @xmath62 cm and aspect ratio close to unity , with the rayleigh number @xmath0 varying from @xmath43 to @xmath204 and the prandtl number @xmath23 fixed at @xmath205 , with the convection cell tilted with respect to gravity at angles @xmath3 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "measurements made with small @xmath2 are aimed at studying bl properties under more steady shear , but the bl itself is assumed to be unperturbed otherwise . for large values of @xmath2",
    "we wish to examine how the bl responds to relatively large perturbations .",
    "we also examined effectiveness of the dynamical bl scaling method in a three - dimensional system .",
    "it is found that the reynolds number @xmath10 ( @xmath206 ) based on the maximum mean horizontal velocity scales with @xmath0 as @xmath12 and the reynolds number @xmath13 ( @xmath207 ) based on the maximum rms velocity scales with @xmath0 as @xmath14 .",
    "both exponents do not seem to have an apparent dependence on the tilt angle . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath10 seem to show a weak increasing trend with @xmath2 .    with the measured horizontal velocity ,",
    "we obtain two length scales , i.e. the viscous bl thickness @xmath9 based on the mean horizontal velocity profile and the length scale @xmath60 based on the rms horizontal velocity profile . it is found that as far as scaling with the reynolds number @xmath10 is concerned",
    ", the behavior of @xmath9 can be divided into two regimes according to the tilting angle of the cell . for @xmath8 , it is found that @xmath11 , which within experimental uncertainty may be considered to be consistent with that of the prandtl - blasius bl .",
    "it thus appears that the main effect of tilting the cell is to restrict the azimuthal meandering of the large - scale circulation but the bl is otherwise not strongly perturbed . for @xmath208 ,",
    "the absolute value of the exponent is found to increase with @xmath2 and in this case the bl may be considered to be strongly perturbed . it is found that the scaling exponent of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ) does not have a strong dependence on @xmath2 as @xmath9 does . but similar to @xmath9 , the absolute values of these exponents increase with increasing @xmath2 .    it is also found that tilting the cell modifies the velocity profile in the bl region , i.e. for different tilt angles the shape of profiles is different .",
    "but for the same tilting angle the velocity profiles measured at different @xmath0 can be brought to collapse on a single curve when the mean velocity is normalized by the maximum velocity @xmath90 and the distance from the plate by the viscous bl thickness @xmath9 .    with simultaneously measured horizontal and vertical velocity components",
    ", we also obtain the reynolds stress @xmath126 in the velocity boundary layer .",
    "it is found that @xmath126 is stronger in the mixing zone comparing with the rectangular cell .",
    "the wall quantities such as the wall shear stress@xmath129 , the viscous sublayer@xmath17 , the friction velocity @xmath19 are also measured .",
    "their scaling exponents with the reynolds number are very close to those predicted for classical laminar boundary layers , which is also consistent with the measurement in rectangular cell .",
    "regarding the dynamical scaling method , we found that the method in general works better when the cell is tilted at larger angle @xmath2 than it does at smaller angles , but the effect is somewhat marginal .",
    "with respect to the influence of @xmath0 , it is found that in general the mean velocity profile sampled in both the laboratory and dynamical frames are more closer to the prandtl - blasius profile at smaller values of @xmath0 than they are at larger @xmath0 , which is consistent with findings from previous dns studies .",
    "moreover , it is found that for smaller values of @xmath0 ( @xmath203 ) the pdf s of the shape factor @xmath29 for the rescaled instantaneous profiles exhibit a peak close to that for the prandtl - blasius profile , whereas for larger values of @xmath0 the peaks shift to smaller values of @xmath29 , indicating the profile s approach to the maximum velocity becomes slower and slower with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "another finding is that the effectiveness of the dynamical scaling method , in terms of its ability of bringing the mean velocity profile closer to that of prandtl - blasius profile , does not have any apparent dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "our general conclusion is that as far as the effectiveness of the dynamical scaling method is concerned the influence of titling angle is much smaller than that of the rayleigh number @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the prandtl - blasius boundary layer theory is a 2d model , so it is perhaps no surprise that the dynamic method works less well in 3d than in 2d .",
