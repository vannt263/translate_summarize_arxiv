    "the @xmath0 ising model has played an important role in the study of the effects of quenched random disorder and frustration on ising systems .",
    "it is defined by the lattice hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 , the sum is over the nearest - neighbor sites of a simple cubic lattice , and the exchange interactions @xmath12 are uncorrelated quenched random variables , taking values @xmath0 with probability distribution @xmath13 for @xmath2",
    "we recover the standard ising model , while for @xmath14 we obtain the usual bimodal ising spin - glass model .",

    "the high - temperature phase is paramagnetic for any @xmath4 .",
    "the low - temperature phase depends on the value of @xmath4 : it is ferromagnetic for small values of @xmath15 , while it is a spin - glass phase with vanishing magnetization for sufficiently large values of @xmath15 .",
    "the different phases are separated by transition lines , which meet at a multicritical point @xmath16 located along the so - called nishimori line .",
    "@xcite the spin - glass transition has been mostly studied at the symmetric point @xmath14 , see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein .",
    "the spin - glass transition line extends up to the nishimori multicritical point,@xcite located at @xcite @xmath17 . for larger values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the transition is ferromagnetic , up to @xmath2 where one recovers the pure ising model , and therefore a transition in the ising universality class . at the ferromagnetic transition line , for @xmath18 ,",
    "the critical behavior is expected to belong to a different universality class .    an interesting hypothesis , which has already been put forward in refs .  , is that the ferromagnetic transition of the @xmath0 ising model belongs to the 3d randomly - dilute ising ( rdis ) universality class ( see , e.g. , refs .   for reviews on randomly - dilute spin models ) .",
    "a representative of the rdis universality class is the randomly site - dilute ising model ( rsim ) defined by the lattice hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 are uncorrelated quenched random variables , which are equal to @xmath21 with probability @xmath22 for @xmath23 and above the percolation threshold of the spins ( @xmath24 on a cubic lattice  @xcite ) , the rsim undergoes a continuous phase transition between a disordered and a ferromagnetic phase , whose nature is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this transition is definitely different from the usual ising transition : for instance , the correlation - length critical exponent  @xcite @xmath8 differs from the ising value  @xcite @xmath25 . the rdis universality class is expected to describe the ferromagnetic transition in generic diluted ferromagnetic systems . for instance",
    ", it has been verified that also the randomly bond - diluted ising model ( rbim ) belongs to the rdis universality class.@xcite these results do not necessarily imply that also the @xmath0 ising model has an rdis ferromagnetic transition line .",
    "indeed , while the rsim ( [ hdil ] ) has only ferromagnetic exchange interactions , the @xmath0 ising model is frustrated for any value of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the ferromagnetic transition in the @xmath0 ising model belongs to the rdis universality class only if frustration is irrelevant , a fact that is not obvious and should be carefully investigated .",
    "reference investigated the issue by means of a monte carlo ( mc ) renormalization - group ( rg ) study , claiming that the @xmath0 ising model belongs to the same rdis universality class as the rsim and the rbim .",
    "it should be noted however that the quoted estimate for the correlation - length exponent at the ferromagnetic transition , @xmath26 , is close to but not fully consistent with the rdis value @xmath8.@xcite another numerical mc work @xcite investigated the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics of the @xmath0 ising model and showed an apparent nonuniversal dynamical critical behavior along the ferromagnetic transition line .",
    "these results are not conclusive and further investigation is called for to clarify this issue .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the transition line of the 3d @xmath0 ising model between the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we investigate the critical behavior by means of mc simulations at various values of @xmath4 in the region @xmath5 .",
    "our finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis provides a strong evidence that the critical behavior of the 3d @xmath0 ising along the ferromagnetic line belongs to the 3d rdis universality class .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are in good agreement with the presently most accurate estimates @xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the 3d rdis universality class .",

    "these improved observables are particular useful to check whether the transition in a given system belongs to the 3d rdis universality class .",
    "to summarize : in order to check whether the ferromagnetic transition of the 3d @xmath0 ising model belongs to the rdis universality class , we perform a fss analysis at fixed @xmath98 , and check if the results for the critical exponents and other universal quantities are consistent with those obtained for the rdis universality class , which is characterized by @xcite critical exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 , by the leading and next - to - leading scaling - correction exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 and by the universal infinite - volume values of the quartic cumulants @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . notice that the fact that we fix @xmath98 does not introduce any bias in our fss analysis .",
    "we performed mc simulations of hamiltonian ( [ lh ] ) with @xmath102 for @xmath103 , close to the critical temperature on cubic lattices of size @xmath104 with periodic boundary conditions , for a large range of lattice sizes : from @xmath105 to @xmath106 for @xmath107 , to @xmath108 for @xmath109 , and to @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "we chose values of @xmath4 not too close to @xmath2 : indeed , as @xmath112 we expect crossover effects due to the presence of the ising transition for @xmath2 and , therefore , that the asymptotic behavior sets in only for large values of @xmath29 .",
    "we return to this point later .",
    "we used a metropolis algorithm and multispin coding .",
    "@xcite in the simulation @xmath113 systems evolve in parallel , where @xmath114 or @xmath115 depending on the computer that is used . for each of these @xmath113 systems we use a different set of couplings @xmath12 .",
    "this allows us to perform 64 parallel simulations on a 64-bit machine , and therefore to gain a large factor in the efficiency of the mc simulations .",
    "we used high - quality random - number generators , such as the ranlux @xcite or the twister @xcite generators .",
    "@xcite using the twister random - number generator , we need about @xmath116 seconds for one metropolis update of a single spin on an opteron processor running at 2 ghz .",
    "our simulations took approximately 3 cpu years on an opteron ( 2 ghz ) processor .",
    "it is worth mentioning that cluster algorithms , such as the swendsen - wang cluster @xcite and the wolff single - cluster @xcite algorithm , show significant slowing down in the @xmath0 ising model . at the earlier stage of this work we performed some simulations of the @xmath0 ising model at @xmath117 using the algorithm used in ref .   to simulate the rsim and the rbim .",
    "there we used a combination of metropolis , swendsen - wang cluster,@xcite and wolff single - cluster @xcite updates .",
    "more precisely , each updating step consisted of 1 swendsen - wang update , 1 metropolis update , and @xmath29 single - cluster updates . in all cases",
    "the exponential autocorrelation times @xmath118 of the magnetic susceptibility was small : @xmath119 in units of the above updating step , even for the largest lattice sizes considered , i.e. @xmath120 . in the @xmath0 ising model at @xmath117 autocorrelation times are much larger . in fig .",
    "[ taucluster ] we plot estimates of @xmath118 as obtained from the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "they show a clear evidence of critical slowing down : @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "such a value of @xmath123 should be compared with the dynamic exponent of swendsen - wang and wolff cluster algorithms in the rsim , which is much smaller : @xcite @xmath124 .",
    "these results show that cluster algorithms behave differently in the @xmath0 ising model , likely due to frustration .",
    "they suggest that frustration is relevant for the cluster dynamics .",
    "taking also into account the computer time required by the cluster algorithms , we then turned to a multispin metropolis algorithm .",
    "this turns out to be much more effective at the lattice sizes considered , although it has a larger dynamic exponent @xmath125 , see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein .",
    "we also mention that the autocorrelation time significantly increases with decreasing @xmath4 ( keeping @xmath29 fixed ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath110 it increases by approximately a factor of 10 from @xmath126 to @xmath111 .",
    "this represents a major limitation to perform simulations for large lattices close to the multicritical point .    for each lattice size",
    "we considered @xmath127 disorder samples , with @xmath127 decreasing with increasing @xmath29 , from @xmath128 for @xmath105 to @xmath129 for the largest lattices . for each disorder sample , we collected a few hundred independent measurements at equilibrium .",
    "the averages over disorder are affected by a bias due to the finite number of measures at fixed disorder.@xcite a bias correction is required whenever one considers the disorder average of combinations of thermal averages .",
    "we used the formulas reported in app .",
    "b of ref .  .",
    "errors were computed from the sample - to - sample fluctuations and were determined by using the jackknife method .",
    "@xcite    our fss analysis is performed at fixed @xmath130 . in order to determine expectation values at fixed @xmath53 , one needs the values of the observables as a function of @xmath62 in some neighborhood of the inverse temperature @xmath131 used in the simulation . in ref .",
    "we used the reweighting method for this purpose .",
    "this requires that the observables and , in particular , the values of the energy are stored at each measurement . for the huge statistics like those we have for the smaller values of @xmath29",

    "this @xmath4 and @xmath29 dependence is always consistent with the existence of the expected next - to - leading scaling corrections , i.e. with a behavior of the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 are fixed to the rdis values:@xcite @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",

    "indeed , according to eq .",
    "( [ arps ] ) , the coefficient of those proportional to @xmath96 is of order @xmath169 , i.e. @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , @xmath171 is small if @xmath172 ( we checked this numerically ) .",
    "this applies to the fss at @xmath117 and 0.90 , where the @xmath96 corrections can be neglected , although in these two cases we can not neglect the leading @xmath85 correction whose coefficient is proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "an analysis of the leading scaling corrections at @xmath173 , assuming the rdis values @xmath99 and @xmath36 ( we perform combined fits to ( [ f5ans ] ) with @xmath174 ) gives the estimate @xmath175 which is approximately in the middle of the ferromagnetic line , i.e. @xmath176 .",

    "we finally recall that @xcite @xmath244 for @xmath2 ( the standard ising model ) , and that @xcite @xmath245 at the multicritical nishimori point at @xmath246 . in fig .",
    "[ bcfig ] we plot the available estimates of the critical temperature @xmath247 in the region @xmath248 .",
    "the estimates of @xmath249 shown in fig .",
    "[ bcfig ] hint at a smooth linear behavior for small values of @xmath250 , close to the ising point at @xmath251 .",
    "this can be explained by some considerations on the multicritical behavior around the ising point at @xmath251 .",
    "the ising critical behavior at @xmath251 is unstable against the rg perturbation induced by quenched disorder at @xmath252 , @xcite which leads to the rdis critical behavior .",
    "indeed such a perturbation has a positive rg dimension @xmath253 at the ising fixed point : @xcite @xmath254 where @xmath255 and @xmath256 are the ising specific - heat and correlation - length critical exponents , and therefore  @xcite @xmath257 .",
    "thus , in the absence of an external magnetic field , beside the scaling field @xmath258 related to the temperature , there is another relevant scaling field @xmath259 associated with the quenched disorder parameter @xmath250 .",
    "general rg scaling arguments  @xcite show that the singular part of the free energy for @xmath260 behaves as @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the crossover exponent , and @xmath263 is a crossover scaling function which is universal ( apart from normalizations ) .",
    "the scaling fields @xmath258 and @xmath259 depend on the parameters of the model . in general",
    ", we expect @xmath264 where @xmath265 , @xmath266 is the critical temperature of the ising model , and @xmath267 is a constant .",
    "no such mixing between @xmath268 and @xmath269 occurs in @xmath259 , since @xmath259 vanishes for @xmath270 .",
    "hence , we can take @xmath271 .",
    "the system has a critical transition for @xmath252 at @xmath272 .",
    "since the singular part of the free energy close to a critical point behaves as @xmath273 ( @xmath274 is the specific - heat exponent of the rdis universality class ) , we must have @xmath275 , where @xmath276 is the value of @xmath277 obtained by setting @xmath278 ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath279^{-\\phi } = x_c,\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath280 where the dots indicate higher - order terms . this expression provides the @xmath269 dependence of the critical temperature for @xmath269 small .",
    "note that the nonanalytic term in eq .",
    "( [ t - beh-0 ] ) is suppressed with respect to the analytic ones , because @xmath281 .",
    "thus , @xmath282 . since @xmath283",
    ", we can also infer that @xmath284 . from the results for @xmath272 we estimate @xmath285 for the @xmath0 ising model .",
    "in this paper we have studied the critical behavior of the 3d @xmath0 ising model at the transition line between the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic phase , which extends from @xmath2 to a multicritical ( nishimori ) point at @xmath286 .",
    "we presented a fss analysis of mc simulations at various values of @xmath4 in the region @xmath5 .",
    "the results for the critical exponents and other universal quantities are consistent with those of the rdis universality class .",
    "for example , we obtained @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are in good agreement with the presently most accurate estimates @xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the 3d rdis universality class .",
    "therefore , our fss analysis provides a strong evidence that the critical behavior of the 3d @xmath0 ising along the ferromagnetic line belongs to the 3d rdis universality class .",
    "we also note that the random - exchange interaction in the @xmath0 ising model gives rise to frustration , while the rdis universality class describes transitions in generic diluted ising systems with ferromagnetic exchange interactions .",
    "this implies that frustration is irrelevant at the ferromagnetic transition line of the 3d @xmath0 ising model",
    ". moreover , the observed scaling corrections are consistent with the rdis leading and next - to - leading scaling correction exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that frustration does not introduce new irrelevant perturbations at the rdis fixed point with rg dimension @xmath287 .",
    "we define the two - point correlation function @xmath288 where the overline indicates the quenched average over the @xmath12 probability distribution .",
    "then , we define the corresponding susceptibility @xmath289 and the correlation length @xmath290 @xmath291 where @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and @xmath294 is the fourier transform of @xmath295 .",
    "we also consider quantities that are invariant under rg transformations in the critical limit . beside the ratio @xmath296 we consider the quartic cumulants @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath297 defined by @xmath298 where @xmath299",
    "we also define corresponding quantities @xmath300 , @xmath139 , and @xmath89 at fixed @xmath98 . finally , we consider the derivative @xmath301 of @xmath53 , and @xmath302 of @xmath54 , with respect to @xmath303 , which allow one to determine the critical exponent @xmath87 .",
