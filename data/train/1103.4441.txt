    "the group of virtual braids @xmath0 , @xmath1 , on @xmath2 strings was introduced by kauffman  @xcite as a generalization of the classical braid group @xmath3 .",
    "the most useful system of generators and defining relations of @xmath0 was introduced by vershinin in @xcite .",
    "the generators of @xmath0 are @xmath4 and the defining relations are the following : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 thus , the group generated by @xmath8 with relations ( [ eq2 ] ) is the braid group @xmath3 ; the group generated by @xmath9 with relations ( [ eq3 ] ) is the symmetric group  @xmath10 ; the relations ( [ eq4 ] ) will be referred to as _ mixed relations_. the last presented relation is equivalent to @xmath11 we remark that the relations @xmath12 do not hold in @xmath0 , and these relations will be referred to as _ forbidden _ relations .",
    "( adding these forbidden relations yields the so - called _ braid permutation group _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there is a natural epimorphism @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 the kernel @xmath15 is called the _ virtual pure braid group _ and is denoted by @xmath16 . generators and relations for @xmath16 are described in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath0 is a semidirect product : @xmath17 .",
    "in ( * ? ? ? * ch .  8) , an action of the braid group @xmath3 on the integer lattice @xmath18 by piecewise - linear bijections is defined . for the reader",
    "s convenience we recall the definition . for @xmath19 denote @xmath20 and @xmath21 . define actions @xmath22 on @xmath23 as follows : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 for a given vector @xmath27 we define the action by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 if @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for a word @xmath35 in the alphabet @xmath36 we define an action by @xmath35 : @xmath37    it can be shown that the above action by @xmath3 on @xmath18 is well defined , i.e. if two words @xmath38 and @xmath39 present the same element of the braid group @xmath3 then @xmath40 for any vector @xmath27 . by the",
    "_ dynnikov coordinates _ of a braid we will mean the vector @xmath41 , where @xmath35 is a word representing that braid .",
    "actions by some elements of @xmath42 on @xmath43 are as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "also , acting by some elements of @xmath46 on @xmath47 we have @xmath48    it is also shown in @xcite that dynnikov coordinates are faithful invariants of braids , i.e.  if @xmath49 then @xmath50 in @xmath3 ; thus , dynnikov coordinates are very useful for solving the words problem in @xmath3 .    here is an outline of the proof : there is a bijection between vectors in  @xmath18 and integer laminations of a sphere with @xmath51 punctures @xmath52 ; under this bijection , our action of  @xmath3 on @xmath18 corresponds to the @xmath3-action on a disk containing punctures @xmath53 .",
    "the key observation is that this disk is _ filled _ by the lamination encoded by the vector @xmath54 ( i.e.  cutting this disk along its intersection with the lamination yields only disks and once - punctured disks ) .",
    "let us define an action by elements of @xmath55 on @xmath18 .",
    "consider the actions on @xmath56 by @xmath57 and @xmath58 as defined in ( [ action - by - sigma ] ) and ( [ action - by - sigma - inverse ] ) , and define the action by @xmath59 as the following permutation of coordinates : @xmath60 for a given vector @xmath27 we define the action by @xmath61 , @xmath29 : @xmath62 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath63 the action by @xmath64 on @xmath18 is defined according to ( [ action - by - generator - sigma-1 ] ) and ( [ action - by - generator - sigma-2 ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 is a word in the alphabet @xmath65 representing an element of the group @xmath0 .",
    "then we define @xmath66    to show that the action by @xmath55 on @xmath18 is correctly defined we will verify that the defining relations of the group @xmath0 are satisfied",
    ". since @xmath67 acts by permuting pairs of coordinates , the relations of the group @xmath10 are obviously satisfied .",
    "the fact that relations of the group @xmath3 are satisfied follows from @xcite .",
    "so , we need to check only the case of mixed relations , i.e. that for any @xmath68 the relations @xmath69 @xmath70 hold . relations ( [ eqn_mixed1 ] ) hold obiously , because @xmath71 acts non - trivial only on the subvector @xmath72 and @xmath73 acts non - trivially only on the subvector @xmath74 . in order to verify ( [ eqn_mixed2 ] )",
    "it is enough to consider the case @xmath75 in the group @xmath76 .",
    "denote @xmath77 from @xmath78 and @xmath79 we see that ( [ eqn_mixed2 ] ) holds .",
    "actions by some elements of @xmath80 on @xmath81 are as follows : @xmath82    let us demonstrate that the forbidden relations are not satisfied .",
    "more exactly , we show that for @xmath83 we get @xmath84 @xmath85 indeed , ( [ eqn_bad1 ] ) holds because @xmath86 but @xmath87 analogously , ( [ eqn_bad2 ] ) holds because @xmath88 but @xmath89    [ questmanturov ] is there any relation between our coordinates on @xmath0 and the invariant of virtual braids defined by manturov in @xcite ?",
    "in this section we will be concerned with the following    [ questfaithful ] is the @xmath0-action on @xmath18 faithful ?",
    "in other words , is it true that only the trivial element of  @xmath0 acts as the identity on @xmath18 ?    in computer experiments , we have tested several billion ( @xmath90 ) random virtual braids with 3 , 4 and 5 strands , but failed to find one that would provide a negative answer .",
    "the programs used for these tests ( written in scilab ) can be obtained from b.  wiest s web page @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that nontrivial elements of @xmath0 may very well act trivially on individual vectors .",
    "let us , for instance , look at the @xmath76-action on @xmath91 .",
    "the actions of @xmath92 and @xmath93 obviously fix this vector , but those of many other braids do , too . here",
    "is one particularly striking example :    the virtual 3 strand braid @xmath94 acts trivially on the vector @xmath91 , and indeed in computer experiments , we found that it acted nontrivially on only about 0.25% of randomly generated vectors of @xmath95 with integer coefficients between @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in this sense",
    ", @xmath98 is `` nearly a negative answer '' to question [ questfaithful ] .",
    "another one is the virtual braid @xmath99 which also moves only about 0.6% of random vectors .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case @xmath100 .",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath101 and the identity element @xmath102 can not be distinguished by the burau representation .",
    "considering actions by these elements on @xmath103 we get @xmath104 , while @xmath105 .",
    "thus , these elements are distinguished by dynnikov coordinates .    in fact , in the case",
    "@xmath100 we have a positive answer to question  [ questfaithful ] .",
    "[ t : vb2 ] the @xmath106action on @xmath56 given by the above formulae is faithful .    we will , in fact show a stronger result than theorem  [ t : vb2 ] , namely that the only element of @xmath107 which acts trivially on a vector @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are different positive integers , is the trivial one . as a simplest vector of this type",
    "one can take @xmath111 .",
