    "the discovery of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in magnetically trapped alkali atoms @xcite and spin - polarized hydrogen atom @xcite has resulted in large body of theoretical and experimental research @xcite on the ground - state as well as excited state properties of trapped atomic gases . for the case of dilute atomic gas , which is the case for most of the experimental situation , the mean - field theory of gp",
    "@xcite has been quite successful in explaining both static ( ground - state ) and dynamic ( collective excitations ) properties of the condensates .",
    "the interacting atomic gas is considered to be dilute when the average distance between the atoms is much larger than the range of interaction potential between the atoms @xcite ( mathematically this is expressed by the condition @xmath2 , where @xmath3 atomic density and @xmath4 is the s wave scattering length of interatomic potential ) . for this case",
    "the interaction between the atoms is well described by two - body collisions characterized by a single parameter obtainable from the potential namely , the s wave scattering length @xmath4 .    in some recent experiments @xcite bec",
    "is achieved with number of atoms @xmath1 being quite high .",
    "it is possible to produce condensates of @xmath5 @xmath6rb atoms , @xmath7 na atoms and @xmath8 h atoms .",
    "the maximum density in the optical traps has been around 10@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "thus , with the increasing atomic density in the condensate it becomes necessary to test the validity of mean - field gp theory .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate systematically the accuracy of the gp theory in the high density limit .",
    "we go beyond mean - field theory and evaluate the corrections using a variational formalism .",
    "we also derive an analytic estimate for the corrections in the frame work of thomas - fermi(tf ) approximation . for this purpose",
    "we use huang - yang @xcite theory for the interatomic interaction energy @xmath11 . in this theory ,",
    "@xmath11 is expanded in power of gas parameter @xmath12 by assuming the atomic gas to be a uniform hard - sphere bose gas .",
    "it is important to note here that the interatomic potential in huang - yang theory is replaced by a pseudopotential .",
    "the expression for @xmath11 is @xcite @xmath13 \\label{1}\\ ] ] in gp theory only the first term in the above expansion is considered as higher order terms are negligible for dilute gas .",
    "however with increasing density higher - order terms become appreciable .",
    "it is , therefore , of interest to study the effects these higher order terms on the ground - state properties of bec .",
    "the effect of higher - order terms in the interatomic potential on the physical properties of bec has recently been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "nunes @xcite has used density functional theory to derive the modified gp ( mgp ) equation . by solving the mgp equation for a weak isotropic trap in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximaion",
    ", he finds that the maximum change in the ground state density due to the higher order terms in eq.([1])is only a few percent for the value of @xmath1 as large as @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the change in the ground state energy per particle has been reported to be sensitive to @xmath1 - for @xmath15 both gp and mgp results are very close whereas , they differ by 33@xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "this result is not in conformity with the analytic estimate @xcite of the correction introduced in the ground state energy by the higher order terms in eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "according to the analytic estimate , the first higher order term in eq.([1 ] ) causes a change of only a few percent in the ground state energy even for very large value of @xmath1 . as discussed below , the second higher order term in eq.([1 ] ) being logarithmic gives negative correction .",
    "therefore , this is expected to partially cancel the correction due to the first higher - order term in the interatomic interaction energy . as a result of this ,",
    "the net correction remain close to a few percent when @xmath1 is varied from @xmath18 to @xmath14 .",
    "fabrocini and polls @xcite have studied the effect of interatomic correlations within the local density approximation and the correlated basis function ( cbf ) theory .",
    "they have solved the resulting mgp equation and the lowest order correlated hartree ( ch@xmath19 ) equation for an isotropic trap using the steepest descent method . both of these methods give corrections which are close to those predicted by the analytical estimates .",
    "however , the ch@xmath19 equation gives lower value of the ground state energy than the mgp equation .",
    "the difference between the results obtained by these two methods shows up more at higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is not clear if this is due to any numerical problem or due to some physical reason .",
    "we discuss more about these results in section 4 .",
    "in this paper we employ variational approach @xcite to solve the mgp equation by using the variational ansatz for the density recently proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also perform calculations for more realistic case of axially symmetric trap ( @xmath20 ) potential . in order to assess the accuracy of our variational results we generalize the virial relations @xcite for the interatomic interaction energy given by eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "recently , several authors @xcite have estimated the corrections introduced by the first higher - order term in the eq.([1 ] ) to assess the accuracy of gp theory .",
    "these authors obtained analytical expressions for the corrections over mean - field results within the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation valid in the large @xmath1 limit . here",
    "we extend these results by including second higher - order term of eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "beside , providing the estimates for corrections these results also serve as a check for the accuracy of our numbers obtained by the variational calculation .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize here that our previous and the present study clearly bring out the advantages of variational approach .",
    "this approach requires numerically less effort than the direct numerical integration method and can handle system of arbitrary number of particle . at the same time",
    ", it provides a very accurate description of the ground state properties of the system .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the variational approach and also derive an expression for the generalized virial relation .",
    "section 3 contains analytical estimates for corrections in the density profile , the total energy and the chemical potential .",
    "results are discussed in section 4 and paper is concluded in section 5 .",
    "the energy functional for a system of n - bosons , each of mass @xmath21 , confined in a trap potential @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 = \\int d{\\bf r}\\left [ \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}|{\\bf\\nabla}\\psi({\\bf r})|^{2 } +   v_{t}({\\bf r})|\\psi({\\bf r})|^{2 } + \\epsilon(n)|\\psi({\\bf r})|^{2 } \\right ] , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the corresponding wave function and gives density via the relation @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath26 we use the local - density approximation ( lda ) expression as given in eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "the energy functional associated with gp theory can be obtained from eq.([2 ] ) by substituting only the first term of eq.([1 ] ) for @xmath26 in eq.([2 ] ) . in this study",
    "we go beyond gp theory by including the second and the third term of eq.([1 ] ) to study the ground - state properties of bec .",
    "for our purpose we consider an axially symmetric trap characterized by two angular frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath28 and the corresponding potential is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the anisotropy parameter of the trapping potential .",
    "as in the gp approach , from eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) the mgp equation can be derived by making the energy functional @xmath31 $ ] stationary with respect to the wave function @xmath24 such that the wave function remains normalized to the total number of particles @xmath1 given by the condition @xmath32 such a variation leads to : @xmath33 \\psi_{1}({\\bf r}_{1 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ &   & = 2 \\mu_{1 } \\psi_{1}({\\bf r}_{1 } ) \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath34 is the chemical potential in the units of @xmath35 corresponding to the normalization constraint given by eq.([norm ] ) . in this equation",
    "we have used the length scale rescaled variables @xmath36,@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 is normalized to unity .    in ref.@xcite and @xcite above equation ( eq.[4 ] )",
    "has been solved numerically for isotropic trap @xmath42 . in this paper",
    "we take recourse to variational approach to solve the eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that with a suitable choice for the variational form of the wave function one can get quite accurate results with less computational effort .",
    "in addition , this approach may provide physical insight which generally get obscured by the complicated computational procedures .",
    "in this paper we use the variational form given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the variational parameters which are obtained by minimizing @xmath47 with respect to this parameters .",
    "this variational form has been shown to describe quite accurately the ground state of the dilute bose gas confined in a trap for a wide range of particle numbers .",
    "when number is small it tends correctly towards gaussian and in the opposite limit it resembles with the tf wave function .",
    "in addition to this in the intermediate region it combines the feature of both in an effective way .",
    "this variational form is also well suited for negative scattering length and is easily generalized for the vortex states .",
    "further , using eq.([5 ] ) the physical observables can be expressed analytically in terms of these three variational parameters .",
    "for example , energy functional @xmath47 can be written as : @xmath48 here @xmath49 , @xmath50 denote average kinetic and harmonic trapping potential energies , respectively . remaining three terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent interatomic interaction energies corresponding to the first , second and the third terms in the energy expansion in eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57   - \\left ( \\frac{\\omega_{\\bot}}{\\omega_{\\bot}^{0}}\\right ) ^ { \\frac{p}{2}}\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\gamma\\left ( \\frac{3}{2p } + 1 \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for particular value @xmath1 the parameter @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 are determined by minimizing the energy given above ( eq.([energy ] ) ) .",
    "the virial relation among different energy components provides a way of checking the correctness of variational or numerical solutions .",
    "for example , within gp theory different energy components satisfy the virial relation @xcite @xmath58 for our purpose we generalize the above relation ( eq.([virialgp ] ) ) valid for the mgp theory . by using variational nature of energy and the scaling transformation @xmath59 we arrive at following expression for the virial relation corresponding to the mgp energy functional @xmath60 for each term of this expansion we have checked the satisfaction of virial relation corresponding to our variational solutions .",
    "the virial relation is satisfied up to 5-th decimal place in our calculation .    before presenting the results",
    ", we make an estimate of the corrections in the density , total energy and the chemical potential as a result of inclusion of two new terms in the interatomic energy . for this",
    "we follow the approach of dalfovo et al.@xcite , which is valid for large @xmath1 .",
    "we use local density approximation for the chemical potential which is justified in the thermodynamic limit @xmath61 where the profile of the density distribution is very smooth . in this approximation",
    "the chemical potential is given by : @xmath62 + v_t({\\bf r } ) \\label{mu}\\ ] ] given the expression for @xmath63 for the homogeneous bose - gas , the density @xmath64 can be calculated by solving eq.([mu ] ) , along with the normalization condition which fixes the parameter @xmath65 on the left hand side of the equation . from eq.([1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath66 , \\label{mul}\\ ] ] where , @xmath67 considering only the first term in the expansion for @xmath68 we recover the mean- field thomas - fermi result @xmath69 normalization condition implies that @xmath70 using the relation @xmath71 we get the corresponding expression for the ground sate energy as @xmath72 when the higher order terms in the expansion for @xmath68 are considered the standard procedure to solve eq.([mu ] ) is by iteration @xcite . on following such procedure",
    "we get @xmath73 now imposing the normalization condition and neglecting the terms of order @xmath74and higher , we obtain @xmath75 ,   \\label{10}\\ ] ] and consequently @xmath76   \\label{11}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath77 appearing in the above equations can be written as @xmath78 thus by using eqs.([dencorr]),([10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) we estimate the correction over the corresponding tf results .",
    "for example a bec with @xmath79 particles and @xmath80 , the second terms in eq.([10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) result in @xmath81 and @xmath82 corrections in the chemical potential and the total energy , respectively , over the corresponding tf values .",
    "third terms , however , lead to negative corrections and these are @xmath83 in the chemical potential and @xmath84 in the total energy . due to the cancellation",
    "the net corrections are approximately of order @xmath85 for both chemical potential and total energy over their corresponding tf values .",
    "thus the third term which is logarithmic in nature compensates for the correction due to the second term in both chemical potential and energy .    in the next section we present results of our variational calculation along with the numbers obtained from these expressions as a further check for our numerical results",
    "in this section we first report calculations on @xmath6rb atoms confined in an isotropic @xmath86 trap .",
    "the choice of isotropic trap is motivated only for the sake of comparison with the existing studies @xcite . as pointed out earlier ,",
    "our variational approach is capable of dealing with asymmetric traps with cylindrical symmetry or even fully symmetric traps . for the symmetric trap we choose trap frequency @xmath87 and",
    "scaled s wave scattering length @xmath88 to be @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . in table 1",
    "we show chemical potentials , total energy and mean radius @xmath91 for particle numbers ranging from @xmath92 to @xmath93 for both gp and mgp cases . for comparison",
    "we also show the corresponding mgp results of ref.@xcitein parenthesis .",
    ".results for the ground - state of @xmath6rb atoms confined in an isotropic trap with @xmath94 hz .",
    "chemical potentials and energies are in units of @xmath35 and length is in units of @xmath95 .",
    "numbers in the brackets correspond to the results of reference @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     thus we conclude that the variational results obtained for anisotropic trap are also quite accurate .",
    "therefore , we demonstrate that by using variational approach described in this paper along with a judicious choice of ansatz for the ground - state wave function it is possible to obtain reasonably accurate results for the to properties of bec , even beyond mean - field approach , without much of a computational effort .",
    "in this paper we have studied the properties of bose gas confined in both isotropic and axially symmetric potential going beyond gp or mean - field approximation by taking higher - order terms in the interatomic interaction energy .",
    "we have used the variational approach to solve the mgp equation for wide range of particle numbers .",
    "we have verified our results using the generalized virial relation as well as by making analytic estimate of the corrections introduced by higher - order terms .",
    "these higher - order terms lead to correction in the total energy , chemical potential and other physical properties of bec .",
    "the magnitudes of these corrections are of the order of @xmath96 even for very large @xmath1 .",
    "however , there is qualitative change in the density profile of the condensate due to presence of the logarthimic term in the interaction energy .",
    "we also critically examine the results in the literature and compare them with our numbers .",
    "here we emphasize that the variational method employed by us gives quite accurate results with considerable computational ease .",
    "it is well known that , corrections of this order are difficult to detect in the experimental @xcitesituation . however , these small changes are also reflected in the collective excitation frequencies of bec and these quantities can be measured with greater accuracy .",
    "motivated by this we are now applying the variational approach and sum rule method of response theory of many - body systems @xcite to calculate collective excitation frequencies .",
    "these results will be presented in our future publication .",
