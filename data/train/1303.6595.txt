    "three - mode optoacoustic parametric interactions were first introduced by braginsky _",
    "et al_. @xcite who presented the phenomena and evaluated the potential risk of 3-mode parametric instability in long optical cavities for gravitational - wave detectors @xcite .",
    "the physics of the 3-mode optoacoustic parametric amplifier is similar to that of an optical parametric amplifier , in which the interaction occurs through the kerr effect .",
    "the 3-mode optoacoustic interaction occurs when 2 optical modes inside an optical cavity are resonantly coupled to a mechanical mode of the cavity mirror .",
    "the coupling is mediated by the radiation pressure forces due to the beating of the two optical modes .",
    "three - mode interactions have been studied extensively @xcite , and observed , in long optical cavities @xcite .",
    "as triply resonant devices , 3-mode optoacoustic parametric amplifiers can in principle have very high sensitivity to torsional motion , achieve strong optoacoustic coupling and require less laser power than a 2-mode interaction @xcite , where only 2 modes are resonant .",
    "for this reason , the 3-mode interaction reduces susceptibility to laser phase noise and amplitude noise @xcite .",
    "the creation of 3-mode parametric amplifiers requires a cavity design in which the mechanical motion of the mirror couples the main laser carrier mode to a transverse mode . for example , an optimal optoacoustic coupling can be achieved by using a torsionally resonant mirror , which has optimal spatial overlap to the tem@xmath3 optical cavity mode .",
    "the mechanical mode of frequency near the mhz range can be matched to the gap between the tem@xmath4 and tem@xmath3 modes in a specially designed optical cavity , as discussed by miao _",
    "this paper describes mechanical resonators designed for table - top 3-mode parametric amplifiers @xcite .    in a small optical cavity ,",
    "3-mode optoacoustic parametric instability was first observed by chen _",
    "et al . _ with a silicon nitride membrane of thickness 50 nm , within a fabry - p@xmath5rot cavity @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a tunable compact table - top system , designed to observe 3-mode optoacoustic parametric interactions by adding a tuning cavity to a main optical cavity .",
    "this would allow continuous tuning between the positive gain regime ( characterized by the stokes mode , or amplification of the acoustic mode ) and the negative regime ( anti - stokes mode , referred to as ` self - cooling ' in the literature @xcite ) , by small adjustments of a lens and mirror .    in order to produce 3-mode optoacoustic parametric amplifiers in a compact table - top setup",
    ", a mechanical resonator is required to be in the mm- and mg - scale ranges , have a high mechanical quality factor , and a mechanical oscillation near the 0.1 to 1 mhz range .",
    ".review of mechanical resonators reported in the literature with high quality factors and frequencies in the range of interest .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we obtained an optimal quality factor value of ( 7.5 @xmath6 0.2 ) @xmath1 for a torsional mode at 401.5 khz measured at room temperature and pressure of @xmath2 pa .",
    "ringdown measurements , as shown in fig .",
    "[ highq ] , were repeated to obtain an estimate of the statistical error on the quality factor .",
    "this value is higher than quality factors obtained from other silicon structure resonators @xcite presented in table [ tab : reviewresonators ] , and is getting close to quality factor values obtained from silicon bulk samples @xcite .    using similar methodology , we studied low and high frequency modes and we summarize results for four modes in table [ tab : qtable ] . both high frequency modes show quality factors significantly higher than for both low frequency modes .",
    "when vibrations overlap the locations of the 3-point suspension system , this can create stronger mechanical losses and hence lower quality factor values .",
    "given that both low frequency modes are predicted by fem to have vibrations on most of the sample area , this could explain why they have quality factors much lower than those of both the high frequency modes , which have vibrations localised on the 3 paddles .",
    "the ` twist ' mode presented in table [ tab : qtable ] is a low frequency mode predicted at 35.5 khz by fem and observed experimentally at 33.45 khz .",
    "the mode shape is described by considering that any two adjacent corners of the wafer are moving in opposite directions .",
    "both low frequency modes in table [ tab : qtable ] have quality factors in the @xmath7 range , low in comparison to higher frequency modes .",
    "the second high quality factor mode shown in table [ tab : qtable ] is termed ` snake ' mode , in which the chain of 3 paddles undergo an s - shaped motion , as predicted by fem , on a x - z plane along the y@xmath8 line ( see axes on fig .",
    "[ amplfem ] ( b ) or ( d ) ) .",
    "this snake mode was predicted at 299.8 khz and found experimentally at 296.22 khz .",
    "the snake mode also has vibrations localised on the 3 paddles , which explains the relatively high quality factor .",
    "the 3-point suspension system had the disadvantage that it made our results sensitive to small displacements of the sample relative to the 3 points .",
    "the quality factors varied greatly as a function of position , reaching a minimum of 40 000 for the torsion mode of interest , for example . using low frequency and large excitation , we were able to shift the position of the wafer inside the closed tank , and obtain the optimal quality factor .",
    "this study has shown that micro - mechanical torsional resonators , designed to optimize spatial overlap with the tem@xmath3 mode in an optical cavity for 3-mode interactions , can have high mechanical quality factors .",
    "we have reported a quality factor of ( 7.5 @xmath6 0.2 ) @xmath1 for a mg - scale resonator at 401.5 khz and at room temperature .",
    "the resonator performance matches the requirements for a proposed 3-mode optoacoustic parametric amplifier .",
    "the resonator is designed to ensure low acoustic stress in the optical coating , so as to minimize optical coating losses .",
    "we ve shown that the resonator can be excited through the substrate without incurring unacceptable suspension losses .",
    "fem predictions were compared to amplitude response across the resonator and the wafer , matching the predicted and measured frequencies and mode shapes . in the future , we propose to assess the use of 3-mode optoacoustic parametric amplifiers to the creation of novel sensor technologies such as electromagnetic sensors , thermal noise sensors or atomic force microscopes . based on previous cryogenic acoustic loss measurements in bulk silicon @xcite , the resonators presented here , if placed in a cryogenic environment , could be expected to achieve quality factors in the range of @xmath9 .",
    "such values would allow a range of experiments in quantum measurements and in advanced transducers to be undertaken .",
    "we are currently working with an optically coated resonator in a small optical cavity designed as an optoacoustic parametric amplifier .",
    "results will be reported in a future paper .",
