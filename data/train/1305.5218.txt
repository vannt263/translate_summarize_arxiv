    "<S> single crystal metal films on insulating substrates are attractive for microelectronics and other applications , but they are difficult to achieve on macroscopic length scales . the conventional approach to obtaining such films is epitaxial growth at high temperature using slow deposition in ultrahigh vacuum conditions . here </S>",
    "<S> we describe a different approach : sputter deposition at modest temperatures followed by annealing to induce secondary grain growth . </S>",
    "<S> we show that polycrystalline as - deposited cu on @xmath0-al~2~o~3~(0001 ) can be transformed into cu(111 ) with centimeter - sized grains . employing optical microscopy , x - ray diffraction , and electron backscatter diffraction to characterize the films before and after annealing , we find a particular as - deposited grain structure that promotes the growth of giant grains upon annealing . to demonstrate one potential application of such films , we grow graphene by chemical vapor deposition on wafers of annealed cu and obtain epitaxial graphene grains of 0.2  mm diameter .    </S>",
    "<S> version :        vapor - phase thin film deposition , first enabled by the invention of modern vacuum technology about a century ago @xcite , has developed into an essential component of many modern technologies . </S>",
    "<S> advances in electron diffraction and microscopy over the past century provided tools for probing the crystalline structure of thin films and spurred investigation of the fundamental processes that determine grain size and orientation @xcite . thus grain growth and epitaxy </S>",
    "<S> have become central topics in thin film research . in applications of thin films </S>",
    "<S> , much effort is spent manipulating grain structure to achieve specific mechanical , electrical , magnetic , optical , and chemical properties . </S>",
    "<S> examples include magnetic recording media @xcite , electrochemical catalysts @xcite , and interconnects for microelectronics whose resistance to electromigration depends on film texture and grain size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a common challenge for metals and semiconductors grown on insulating substrates is to obtain a desired orientation of grains ( such as < 111 > perpendicular to the film plane ) along with macroscopic grain sizes ( @xmath1{\\mu m}$ ] in the plane of the film ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional approach to this challenge to is to seek conditions that produce large epitaxial grains during growth . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach , and the one that is the focus of this work , is to deposit a polycrystalline film and then produce large epitaxial grains by annealing . </S>",
    "<S> although the basic idea was clearly described almost 25 years ago by c. v. thompson et al . , who called it `` epitaxial grain growth '' @xcite , it has remained relatively unexplored since then . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that this approach can produce films with individual grains with area @xmath2{cm^{2}}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the work described here was motivated by a desire to produce cu(111 ) films that approach the ideal of a single crystal and that are suitable as substrates for chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) at temperatures near @xmath3{^{\\circ}c}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> copper is the most commonly used substrate for graphene cvd because its negligible carbon solubility enables growth of precisely one layer over a wide range of growth conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be readily etched away to allow transfer of the graphene to other substrates for further device fabrication steps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although polycrystalline cu foils are typically used , the cu(111 ) surface provides a hexagonal template with a relatively small lattice mismatch ( 3.8% and 2.2% for graphene and h - bn , respectively ) that allows epitaxial growth with low , uniform strain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previous work on bulk single crystals has shown that graphene has less rotational disorder when grown on cu(111 ) than on cu(100 ) @xcite . exploiting the benefits of cu(111 ) for commercial </S>",
    "<S> , wafer - scale production of graphene will require a process for producing crystalline films on a suitable substrate . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly attractive substrate is @xmath0-al~2~o~3~(0001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is widely used by manufacturers of radio - frequency electronics and light - emitting diodes in the form of wafers with diameters up to 200  mm , it is physically and chemically stable under graphene cvd conditions , and it can likely be reused after metal etching to release the graphene layer .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a large body of work pertaining to cu on @xmath0-al~2~o~3~ , which is a model system for epitaxy , adhesion , and other properties of metal - ceramic interfaces @xcite . on the @xmath0-al~2~o~3~(0001 ) surface </S>",
    "<S> , cu grows epitaxially with a ( 111 ) texture , i.e. two distinct in - plane orientation relationships ( ors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly observed or ( typically referred to as or  i ) is . </S>",
    "<S> the second or , called or  ii , is . </S>",
    "<S> the two ors differ by a rotation of @xmath4 about < 111>. several studies have found that the dominant or depends sensitively on substrate preparation @xcite , substrate temperature @xcite , deposition rate @xcite , and other conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that a particular mixture of or  i and or  ii in as - deposited cu films enables giant grain growth upon annealing .    </S>",
    "<S> grain growth in thin films can occur during deposition and during subsequent processing steps such as annealing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium state of a film is determined by the interplay of various energies : film - substrate interface , film free surface , grain boundary , and strain . </S>",
    "<S> the actual state of a film is also affected by kinetic processes such as diffusion , thus substrate temperature and the energy of arriving species during deposition are important in determining grain size and orientation . due to the interplay among various energies , conventional grain growth stagnates when the average grain size is about @xmath5 the film thickness @xcite . in some cases , particularly for cu and other fcc metals where grain boundaries are mobile at relatively low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , grains can grow larger than the stagnation limit through a process known as secondary grain growth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs when grains of a particular low energy orientation grow at the expense of a matrix of other , stagnated grains . </S>",
    "<S> although secondary grain growth can occur during deposition , it is typically exploited during subsequent annealing @xcite , as we do here . in </S>",
    "<S> cu films sputtered onto amorphous sio~2~ , secondary grain growth driven by minimization of strain energy has produced grains @xmath6{\\mu m}$ ] to @xmath7{\\mu m}$ ] across with a ( 100 ) orientation @xcite . in our epitaxial cu films , </S>",
    "<S> the fact that a ( 111 ) orientation is favored indicates surface and interface energies dominate over strain energies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> annealing can cause a thin film to break into discontinuous islands , a phenomenon known as dewetting or agglomeration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the process , which is driven by minimization of the total energy of the film / substrate system , typically begins with the development of thermal grooves at grain boundaries in the film @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these grooves deepen at a rate that increases with temperature , and dewetting occurs when the grooves reach the substrate , so thinner films become discontinuous at lower temperatures . for films exposed to temperatures near the bulk melting point , as is the case when cu ( melting point of @xmath8{^{\\circ}c}$ ] ) is used for cvd of graphene </S>",
    "<S> , dewetting is a major limitation on the survivability of the film . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , grain growth and dewetting are competing processes @xcite . as we show here </S>",
    "<S> , the growth of giant grains at temperatures somewhat below @xmath3{^{\\circ}c}$ ] allows cu films to endure subsequent graphene growth conditions with minimal dewetting .    in this paper , we present an extensive investigation of grain size and orientation for cu films sputtered onto @xmath0-al~2~o~3~(0001 ) substrates at a wide range of temperatures , and then annealed at temperatures near @xmath3{^{\\circ}c}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize our films using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and electron backscatter diffraction ( ebsd ) to measure crystallinity , and optical microscopy to show film properties over large areas . </S>",
    "<S> we also report results for large domain graphene growth by cvd on these films , characterized by optical microscopy and raman spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> our findings show that an appropriate combination of deposition and annealing temperatures can produce cu(111 ) single crystal films , free of twinning and thermal grooves , over macroscopic length scales . </S>",
