    "the turnpike property has been discussed recently for the optimal control of linear systems governed by partial differential equations , see @xcite . turnpike theory has originally been discussed in economics , see @xcite . for systems governed by ordinary differential equations",
    "the turnpike property has been discussed for example in @xcite , also for the nonlinear case .",
    "the turnpike property states loosely speaking that if the objective function penalizes both control cost and the difference of the optimal trajectory to a given desired stationary state , the optimal controls will steer the system quickly to the desired stationary state and then the system will remain on this path most of the time . in section 4 of @xcite ,",
    "optimal control problems with the wave equation are considered on a given finite time interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the control is distributed in the interior of the domain and no conditions for the terminal state at the time @xmath0 are prescribed . in this paper",
    "we consider problems of optimal boundary control of the wave equation .",
    "we consider both problems with infinite time horizon and problems with finite time horizon .",
    "for the finite time problems , we prescribe exact terminal conditions .",
    "if the objective function only penalizes the control cost , for the @xmath5 case in @xcite it has been shown that the optimal controls are periodic , so in particular they do not have the turnpike structure .",
    "this illustrates that the turnpike property heavily depends on the choice of the objective functions , that has to couple the control cost with the penalization of the distance to the desired state .",
    "we consider a system governed by the one - dimensional wave equation on a finite space interval , with a homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition at one side , and a neumann boundary control action at the other : @xmath6 where the control @xmath7 belongs to the class of square - integrable functions .",
    "let @xmath8 be such that @xmath9 , and let @xmath10 be arbitrary . for every @xmath11 , there exists a unique solution @xmath12 of such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "as is well known , the system is exactly controllable if and only if @xmath15 ( see for example @xcite ) . in this paper ,",
    "given any @xmath16 $ ] and any @xmath17 $ ] , we consider the optimal control problem @xmath18 of finding a control @xmath19 minimizing the objective functional @xmath20 such that the corresponding solution of , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , satisfies @xmath21 at the final time ( exact null controllability problem ) . if @xmath3 , then one can drop the final constraint requirement , which , by the way , happens to be automatically satisfied in the sense of a limit ( this is a well known result coming from riccati theory ) .    for @xmath22 , this very classical optimal control problem",
    "( minimization of the @xmath1 norm of the control ) has been considered , e.g. , in @xcite ( see also @xcite for optimal control problems consisting of satisfying consumer demands at the boundary of the system , such as in gas transportation networks ) , and it is easy to see that the optimal control is periodic ( see @xcite ) , with a period equal to @xmath23 , that is , twice the time needed by a wave starting at the boundary point where the control acts to return to that point .",
    "note that , in this case , the optimal control is as well given by the hilbert uniqueness method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath24 , then the objective functional involves a nontrivial boundary tracking term . this tracking term may be considered as a boundary observation of the space derivative of the state at the uncontrolled end of the string . as we are going to prove , in that case , the optimal control action is then essentially concentrated at the beginning and at the end of the time interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "more precisely , the optimal control can be written as the sum of an exponentially decaying term and of an exponentially increasing term .    as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath0 is large then the optimal control , solution of @xmath18 , approximately consists of three pieces : the first and the third pieces are in short - time , and are transient arcs ; the middle arc is in long time , and is exponentially close to @xmath2 .",
    "this is a turnpike phenomenon ( see @xcite ) , meaning that the optimal trajectory , starting from given initial data , very quickly approximately reaches the steady - state @xmath25 ( within exponentially short time , say @xmath26 ) , then remains exponentially close to that steady - state within long time ( say , over the time interval @xmath27 $ ] ) , and , in the last short - time part @xmath28 $ ] , leaves this neighborhood in order to quickly reach its target .    in this approximate picture , if @xmath3 ( infinite horizon ) , then the last transient arc does not exist since the infinite - horizon target is the steady - state @xmath25 . in that case",
    ", the norm of the optimal control decays exponentially in time , and the same is true for the optimal state .",
    "indeed , smallness of the observation term for a sufficiently long time interval with zero control implies proportional smallness of the state ( this follows from an observability inequality , see @xcite ) .    another possible picture illustrating the turnpike behavior is the following . for @xmath0 large , the optimal trajectory of @xmath18 approximately consists of three arcs : the first arc is the solution of @xmath29 ( infinite horizon problem ) , forward in time , and converges exponentially to @xmath2 .",
    "the second arc , occupying the main ( middle ) part of the time interval , is the steady - state @xmath2 .",
    "the third arc is the solution of @xmath29 , but backward in time .",
    "note that the optimal control problem @xmath29 fits into the well known linear quadratic riccati theory .    in all cases",
    ", we will provide completely explicit formulas for the optimal controls , which explain and imply the turnpike behavior observed for @xmath24 .",
    "this is in contrast with the case @xmath30 for which the control action is distributed uniformly along the time interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "in addition , we will also establish a similarity theorem showing that , for every @xmath0 that is a positive even integer , there exists an appropriate weight @xmath24 for which the optimal solutions of @xmath18 and of @xmath29 coincide along @xmath31 $ ] .    in this paper",
    "we focus on problems governed by the 1d wave equation . in order to illustrate the generality of the turnpike phenomenon , before we turn to the 1d wave equation we consider an example in a more general framework with a strongly continuous semigroup in the following section .",

    "let @xmath151 be the state generated by the control @xmath147 defined in the theorem .",
    "for a control of the form @xmath313 , the generated state is @xmath314 , where @xmath285 is the state generated by the control @xmath286 , with null initial conditions and with the boundary conditions @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "the value of the objective functional of @xmath29 is @xmath315 we consider the linear part @xmath316 using ( [ dalembertloesung ] ) , we have @xmath317 and @xmath318 , with @xmath271 given by ( [ abminus ] ) , and @xmath319 on @xmath225 .",
    "it follows that @xmath320 , @xmath321 , and @xmath322 and therefore , @xmath323 by lemma [ lemmaalpha ] , for @xmath223 the values of @xmath324 and @xmath325 are determined from the initial data , and since they are equal to zero , we have @xmath293 .",
    "this yields @xmath326 if @xmath182 then the roots of the characteristic polynomial @xmath327 defined by ( [ pgammadefinition ] ) are @xmath328 and @xmath329 . in particular , we have @xmath303 . note that , by lemma [ lemmaalpha ] , for @xmath223 the values of @xmath330 and of @xmath331 are determined from the initial data . by ( [ recursion ] ) , we have @xmath332 for @xmath275 . using the representation ( [ ugammadefinition ] ) of @xmath333 for @xmath334 , and using ( [ abminus ] )",
    ", we infer that @xmath335 for @xmath334 .",
    "similarly , using ( [ recursion ] ) , we have @xmath336 for @xmath334 . using the representation ( [ ugammadefinition ] ) of @xmath333 for @xmath337 , and using ( [ abminus ] )",

    "it follows that @xmath339 for @xmath132 . by induction , using ( [ rekursionableitung ] ) , ( [ uzkgammagleichung ] ) and ( [ ugammadefinition ] ) , we get that @xmath340 for every @xmath132 and every @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , we have obtained that @xmath341 for every @xmath223 and every @xmath150 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath307 . concerning the value of the objective functional of @xmath29",
    ", we infer that @xmath342 with a strict inequality whenever @xmath309 .",
    "it follows that @xmath147 is the unique optimal solution of @xmath29 for @xmath182 . for @xmath30",
    "the result also follows from the representation ( [ lgammarepresentation ] ) of @xmath310 , with the difference that , in this case , the characteristic polynomial is @xmath343 having the unique root @xmath312 .",
    "the inequality ( [ decayinfinity ] ) follows from ( [ decayrekursion ] ) , since for the optimal state we have the energy @xmath344 for every @xmath132 and every @xmath133 .",
    "theorem [ thmpt ] is proved for @xmath3 .    the computation of the solution with the characteristic polynomial @xmath327 is related to techniques used for linear difference equations , or for finite - dimensional linear systems with tridiagonal matrices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath345 . using ( [ gammachoice ] ) , we have @xmath346 , and then , using ( [ exqactcontrolrepresentation ] ) and the representation ( [ ugammadefinition ] ) of @xmath147 , we infer ( [ identischesteuerung ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath347 the inequality ( [ similarityungleichung ] ) follows similarly , using ( [ periodicneumann ] ) and ( [ uzkgammagleichung ] ) , since @xmath348 theorem [ similaritytheorem ] is proved .",
    "we have discussed the influence of the objective function and of the time horizon on optimal neumann boundary controls for the 1d wave equation .",
    "if the objective function is the control norm ( @xmath22 ) and if the terminal state is prescribed exactly , then the control action is distributed uniformly over the whole time horizon , and coincides with the control given by the hilbert uniqueness method , which is periodic .",
    "in contrast , if the objective function involves an additional tracking term ( @xmath24 ) , then the optimal control action is essentially concentrated at the starting time @xmath2 and at the terminal time @xmath0 , and in - between it is exponentially close to @xmath2 .",
    "we have given explicit formulas , showing that the control is the sum of an exponentially decreasing term and of an exponentially increasing one .",
    "if the time horizon is infinite ( without final conditions ) , then only the first term remains , and the optimal control exponentially stabilizes the system , accordingly to the classical riccati theory .",
    "the norms of the control action and of the optimal state decay then exponentially in time .",
    "these results show that as soon as the objective functional of the optimal control problems for the considered system contains a nontrivial tracking term , the optimal solution has a special behavior referred to as the turnpike phenomenon .",
    "finally , we have shown that , if the final time @xmath0 is a positive even integer , then there exists a weight @xmath179 such that the solution of the problem of exact controllability with minimal control norm coincides with the solution of the infinite horizon optimal control problem along the time interval @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "this result justifies a receding horizon control strategy , where the first part of a finite horizon optimal control is used and then the procedure is updated in order to control the system over an infinite time horizon .",
    "as already said , the turnpike property has been much investigated in finite dimension ( see @xcite and references therein for a general result ) . in the infinite - dimensional setting , in @xcite",
    "distributed control has been considered both for the heat equation and the wave equation .",
    "the turnpike phenomenon put in evidence in the present paper shows an interesting qualitative bifurcation of the hum control as soon as the objective functional involves a tracking term .",
    "however , here , we have been able to show it by means of explicit computations .",
    "first of all , it makes sense to consider an objective functional in which the tracking term is replaced with a discrepancy between the solution and a time - independent function , which is not necessarily a steady - state . according to the results of @xcite",
    ", we expect then that the turnpike property still holds true , and that , in large time , the optimal trajectory remains essentially close to the optimal steady state state , defined as the the closest steady - state to the objective .",
    "however , in that case , we certainly do not have explicit formulas as derived in the present paper .",
    "moreover , here we only considered a functional penalizing the normal derivative at @xmath349 , and then we can only consider a time - independent function that is a steady - state , as said in remark [ rem_steadystate ] .",
    "but if instead , we were considering for instance the full norm in @xmath350 , then we could consider in the objective functional a term of the form @xmath351 , where @xmath352 need not be a steady - state .",
    "then , what can be expected is that , in large time , the optimal trajectory remains essentially close to the steady - state of the form @xmath353 that is the closest possible to the target @xmath352 .    for more general multi - d wave equations ,",
    "the situation is open .",
    "even if explicit computations can only be done in specific cases , we expect that the turnpike phenomenon is generic within the class of optimal control problems for controllable wave equations , and that hum controls characterized by the adjoint system develop a quasi - periodic pattern , but when characterized by a more robust optimality cost , then , satisfy the turnpike property .",
    "another open issue is the investigation of semilinear wave equations ( see @xcite ) , for which steady - states may play an important role . of course",
    ", in that case , we can not expect that the turnpike property hold globally , but it should also hold as well at least in some neighborhood of an optimal steady - state ( see discussions in @xcite ) .",
