    "the theory of quantum error correcting codes provides the means to designing a quantum memory , which is to be regarded as the basic building block of future quantum computers .",
    "topological quantum codes have proved to be specially advantageous in pushing progress in this enterprise , since they feature high thresholds and rely on local interactions . in order to protect quantum information from noise ,",
    "two complementary strategies have been studied .",
    "on one hand , a quantum memory should be designed to be robust against fluctuations of external parameters , which means that the information would need to be encoded in degrees of freedom which are very weakly coupled to the environment . ideally , this decoupling from environmental fluctuations should increase as the memory is made larger , which , due to the local nature of noise , suggests that information should be stored in non - local degrees of freedom .",
    "one possibility to achieve this is to design a quantum system whose degenerate ground state consists of codewords of some error correcting code , so that local errors are energetically penalised .",
    "the first and most salient example of such a memory is the toric code @xcite , in which information is stored in a degenerate ground space , and logical errors are non - contractible loops of single - qubit errors .",
    "topological order prevents the existence of thermally stable memories in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this is because for two - dimensional topological memories coupled to a thermal bath , a local error can evolve induced by unwanted terms of the hamiltonian and turn into non - trivial error chain at no energy cost .",
    "it is possible to design thermally stable memories in three dimensions @xcite and even in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "however it remains unclear how these devices would be implemented and controlled .",
    "of particular relevance to this work are the results in where several aspects about thermal fragility and localisation of local errors in two - dimensional memories have been considered @xcite .    on the other hand , since the hamiltonian of a quantum memory will in general contain extra terms due to unwanted imperfections , impurities or external fields , among others , undesired evolution of the quantum information will take place .",
    "this needs to be accounted for actively , that is , quantum error correction techniques have to be used to undo the unwanted evolution @xcite . in order to perform active error correction ,",
    "the stabilisers of the quantum code have to be frequently measured to obtain a syndrome vector , which indicates which operations must be carried out to undo the errors .",
    "future quantum memories will use both active error correction as well as some amount of protection at the physical level . the more protection gained at the physical level , the less resources in terms of redundancy , measurements and classical post - processing will be needed .    here",
    "we explain how to supplement topological memories with ideas from a recently proposed technique by some of the authors , known as operator zeno effect @xcite .",
    "we focus on two - dimensional memories , although this method is applicable to any code that features a subsystem structure @xcite . among the benefits of this new approach",
    "are easier syndrome obtention , since only three qubit measurements are needed , as well as the suppression of the unwanted parts of the hamiltonian resulting in logical errors .",
    "the original toric code hamiltonian @xcite has a degenerate ground state which is used to encode two logical qubits .",
    "the simplest excitations of the code correspond to the creation of a pair of quasiparticles .",
    "once they are created , they can move within the code at no energy cost , and recombination of these quasiparticles after a non - contractible orbit results in a non - trivial action on the encoded qubits . to see the relation between the usual toric code and the _ subsystem _ toric code ,",

    "in fact , @xmath25 . crucially , the gauge qubits associated with the removed physical qubits are localised , whereas the logical subsystems retain its non - local character .",

    "note that for each plaquette , only one of the gauge operators is linearly independent . only three - qubit measurements , rather than six - qubit measurements are needed in order to retrieve a syndrome vector .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this code features a threshold of almost a percent against depolarising errors .",
    "we now show how , by frequently measuring the gauge operators of the subsystem toric code , random motion of excitations can be slowed down and even  frozen \" , so that the unwanted dynamics leading to logical errors will not be present in the effective hamiltonian of the code .",
    "the operator quantum zeno effect ( oqze ) is a refinement of the subspace quantum zeno effect @xcite , where a set of non - commuting observables are measured sequentially , in such a way that the quantum state evolves randomly , instead of being constrained within one subspace of the total hilbert space .",

    "in general , @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not commute , and this constitutes the generalisation of the oqze . yet , certain operators fulfilling the condition @xmath37 , which we call measurement invariant operators ( mio ) , will slow down their evolution as the frequency of the measurement series increases .",

    "this can be seen as an effective evolution arising as the frequency of the measurements is increased : + @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective hamiltonian resulting from frequently performing the measurements @xcite .",
    "figuratively speaking , the frequent measurements will  sever \" the code hamiltonian until commutes with all the measurement operators , as it were .",
    "in general , the advantage of the oqze over the subspace qze is that it is possible to freeze dynamics outside of the computational subspace by measuring operators acting on fewer qubits .",
    "this is a vital consideration when it comes to physical implementations of a quantum memory , since reducing the physical requirements will revert in lower effective error rates .",
    "an effective dynamics will emerge as a result of frequently measuring the gauge operators , as summarised in eq .",

    "the key idea is to separate the total hamiltonian into measurement invariant and measurement non - invariant parts , @xmath40 .",

    "although excitations come in pairs , we will be concerned with motion of a single quasiparticle . to do that",
    ", we look at the single - exciton subspace of @xmath48 . in the subsystem toric code",

    "we call these configurations  information microstates \"",
    ". the degeneracy in the choice of the state with one excitation at one site is @xmath59 , and it is a consequence of the subsystem structure of the code . in a similar way one can define the ground state in the subdomain , using a slightly modified version of eq .",
    "( [ microstates ] ) .",
    "once the code boundaries are considered , the topological degeneracy is recovered .",

    "notice that @xmath63 and @xmath64 do not commute , due to the subsystem structure of the code .",

    "remarkably , the subsystem structure of the code will induce onsite disorder in the single - exciton subspace , and this disorder will moreover fluctuate in time .",
    "this is a consequence of the non - commutativity of the gauge operators .    the tunneling elements in eq .",

    ", we discuss only tunnelling between dark plaquettes , since the same reasoning applies to light plaquettes .",
    "this randomness in the tunnelling elements , together with the randomness in the onsite energy , will lead to some amount of localisation @xcite .",
    "however , in next subsection we show that the dynamics caused by the measurement non - invariant hamiltonian is slowed - down are even cancelled in the large measurement frequency limit , so both the tunneling elements and the onsite disorder caused by @xmath79 will vanish as the measurement frequency is increased .",
    "the time evolution is given by the superoperator in eq .",

    "it is not difficult to see from the decomposition @xmath98 that selective measurements can not increase the norm of operators and thus will also satisfy the inequalities in eq .",
    "( [ tunnel2 ] ) .",
    "in previous section we introduced weak projective measurements as a model for errors occurring at read - out stage .",
    "it is possible to consider yet another deviation from the idealised measurement scenario by allowing the measured gauge operators to be slightly different from the ideal ones",
