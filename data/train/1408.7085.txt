    "the recent detection of the noble gas compound @xmath9arh@xmath0 in the crab nebula @xcite and , more recently in various other regions @xcite , has tremendously opened up the chemistry of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and has led to questions about the provenance of this molecule @xcite and the possible existence of other noble gas compounds to be found in various regions of the ism .",
    "arh@xmath0 has been proposed to form via the ar@xmath13 reaction in the ism @xcite and has been explored both observationally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the noble gases ( he , ne , ar , kr , xe ) have been called `` noble '' due to their aversion to chemical reactivity brought about by the complete filling of their valence electron shell .",
    "hence , electrons are not easily shared by these atoms and bonds are not typically made .",
    "however , noble gas atoms can be polarized by various substituent groups , and cationic and van der waals noble gas compounds have long been studied @xcite .",
    "what is intriguing and ground - breaking about the discovery of arh@xmath0 in the crab nebula is that a noble gas compound has finally been shown to exist somewhere in nature .",
    "the ism is a natural place to find noble gas compounds where the pressures and temperatures of a given region may be just right for the synthesis of terrestrially unstable molecules .",
    "radicals and even anions have been commonly detected in the ism by comparison , largely , to spectroscopic data made available in databases like the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) @xcite .",
    "however , the chief problem with the detection of noble gas compounds in the ism is a lack of adequate spectroscopic data since these molecules are difficult to study in the laboratory combined with the ensuing fact that little need has previously been demonstrated for such data .",
    "a follow - up study @xcite to this initial discovery has produced highly - accurate rovibrational reference data for @xmath9arh@xmath0 , as well as the other abundant ar isotope @xmath10arh@xmath0 , in order to augment that from the cdms which was used in the detection of @xmath9arh@xmath0 in the crab nebula .",
    "hence , if more noble gas compounds are to be detected , reliable spectroscopic data must be generated .",
    "searches for the related heh@xmath0 and neh@xmath0 are almost certainly underway if not already completed @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that noble gas compounds containing krypton and xenon will be observed since these atoms are both larger than iron and exist in substantially smaller abundances .",
    "however , the large dipole moments exhibited by noble gas hydride cations @xcite brought about from the drastic difference between the centre - of - mass ( very close to the noble gas atomic centre ) and the centre - of - charge ( roughly midway between the two atoms ) make them very rotationally bright aiding in their potential detection as a class .",
    "even so , other compounds containing he , ne , and ar are more likely to be observed in the ism than those containing the heavier noble gas atoms .",
    "various noble gas species , both cationic and neutral , have been shown to be stable through laboratory experiments and quantum chemical computations .",
    "for example , high - resolution infrared data of the ng - h@xmath1 ( ng = ne , ar , kr ) structures have been provided @xcite , and computational studies as to their energy profiles , as well as that of heh@xmath1 , have shown that these are minima on their respective potential energy surfaces ( pess ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , complexes of one to three noble gas atoms bonded to h@xmath14@xmath0 , a molecule of substantial importance to astrochemistry @xcite , have exhibited marked stabilities @xcite .",
    "other noble gas molecules are known @xcite , but the next - simplest class of noble gas compounds are simply the ng - h@xmath1@xmath0 species .",
    "there exists very little data on this class of compounds which is surprising due to their relative simplicity .",
    "@xcite recently observed heh@xmath1@xmath0 , in addition to `` all conceivable combinations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 '' for he@xmath17h@xmath18@xmath0 , in mass spectrometry experiments , indicating that these ng - h@xmath1@xmath0 structures are likely stable minima , as well .",
    "@xcite studied the reaction of ne + h@xmath1@xmath0 and found that the global minimum on the pes is actually neh@xmath1@xmath0 following work on this same surface from @xcite .",
    "several studies have explored the interaction of argon atoms and atomic cations with hydrogen molecules and molecular cations @xcite where most of these build on the seminal work by @xcite where noble gas dimers were reacted with hydrogen molecules .",
    "arh@xmath1@xmath0 is believed to exist on the pes due to the relative energetics of the total surface , and it seems probable , therefore , that these ng - h@xmath1@xmath0 molecules are experimentally observable .",
    "however , spectroscopic data has not been provided for the ng - h@xmath1@xmath0 molecules in order to confirm their presence in these experiments .    in this present study ,",
    "the formation / dissociation pathways of two ng - h@xmath1@xmath0 cations , neh@xmath1@xmath0 and arh@xmath1@xmath0 , are provided .",
    "additionally , the rovibrational spectroscopic data of these two noble gas dihydride cations are produced in order to assist in their potential discovery in the ism .",
    "building on previous quantum chemical studies that have generated rotational constants to better than @xmath19 of the corresponding experimental values and fundamental vibrational frequencies within 5 @xmath20 , or even 1 @xmath20 in some cases @xcite , rotational constants , dipole moments , spectroscopic constants , and fundamental vibrational frequencies are provided for these two open - shell noble gas cations and their myriad isotopologues .",
    "the highly - accurate structural and spectroscopic data necessary to examine the presence of neh@xmath1@xmath0 and arh@xmath1@xmath0 in any reaction scheme is derived here from quartic force fields ( qffs ) .",
    "qffs are fourth - order taylor series approximations to the nuclear hamiltonian @xcite and are of the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are displacements and @xmath23 are the force constants .",
    "these methods provide low - cost ( relative to producing a global pes ) but still high - accuracy computationally - derived spectroscopic data .",
    "the most accurate qffs @xcite begin from coupled cluster singles , doubles , and perturbative triples [ ccsd(t ) ] @xcite geometry optimizations with the cc - pv5z basis sets @xcite .",
    "ar , however , requires the cc - pv(5+d)z basis set @xcite , but this will simply be called cc - pv5z ( and likewise for similar basis sets ) for ease of discussion .",
    "the geometrical parameters are further corrected for the correlation of the core electrons by ccsd(t ) geometry optimizations with the martin - taylor ( mt ) core - correlating basis set @xcite derived to treat these properties . in this case",
    ", the difference between the ccsd(t)/mt bond lengths with core and those without core electrons are added to the ccsd(t)/cc - pv5z bond lengths .",
    "all computations are based on restricted open - shell reference wavefunctions @xcite for these open - shell cations .    from this linear reference geometry ,",
    "a grid of 55 symmetry - unique points are used to define the qff .",
    "displacements of the two bond lengths are made in @xmath24 increments of 0.005  , and the bond angle @xmath24 increments are 0.005 radians .",
    "the ng@xmath25h bond length is coordinate 1 , the h@xmath25h bond length is coordinate 2 , and the ng@xmath25h@xmath25h bond angle is coordinate 3 , where this latter term is treated in a linear - bending term defined in the intder program @xcite and discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "degenerate with and perpendicular to coordinate 3 is the other ng@xmath25h@xmath25h bond angle , which is designated as coordinate 4 .",
    "however , the symmetry relationship of this coordinate to coordinate 3 negated explicit treatment of this angle @xcite . at each point , ccsd(t ) energies are computed with the aug - cc - pvtz , aug - cc - pvqz , and aug - cc - pv5z basis sets @xcite , which are extrapolated to the one - particle complete basis set ( cbs ) limit via a three - point formula @xcite . to these cbs energies , corrections for core correlation from the mt basis set with and without core electrons and scalar relativistic @xcite corrections",
    "are also made .",
    "this definition of the qff is called the cccr qff from the `` c '' for cbs , `` cc '' for core correlation , and `` r '' for relativity @xcite .",
    "the cccr force constants are derived from a fitting of the qff via a least - squares approach .",
    "this also produces the equilibrium geometry with a sum of squared residuals on the order of 10@xmath26 a.u.@xmath27 for neh@xmath1@xmath0 and 10@xmath28 a.u.@xmath27 for arh@xmath1@xmath0 . utilizing this new minimum , the force constants are refit to produce zero gradients and positive quadratic terms along with subsequently more complete cubic and quartic terms .",
    "the force constants are then incorporated in the linear nuclear hamiltonian via the spectro program @xcite , where second - order perturbation theory produces the spectroscopic constants @xcite and vibrational frequencies @xcite .",
    "most of the electronic structure computations make use of the psi4 quantum chemistry package @xcite , but the scalar relativistic energy points as well as the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pv5z dipole moment computations utilize molpro2012.1 @xcite made available on the pittsburgh supercomputing center s blacklight cluster .",
    "the force constants for @xmath29 neh@xmath1@xmath0 are given in table [ nefc ] following the coordinate ordering defined in the previous section .",
    "this linear structure is clearly a minimum since all of the second derivatives are positive , indicating an upward curve to the pes .",
    "the structural and spectroscopic data for @xmath7neh@xmath1@xmath0 and its deuterated isotopologues are given in table [ ne20 ] while the geometric and spectroscopic data for the less abundant neon isotopic cation , @xmath8neh@xmath1@xmath0 , and its deuterated isotopologues are in table [ ne22 ] .",
    "the force constants remain the same for any of the isotopologues since they are computed within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the neh@xmath1@xmath0 and nehd@xmath0 molecules , regardless of neon isotope , require input of a @xmath30 type-1 fermi resonance as well as a @xmath31 type-2 fermi resonance . likewise , the nedh@xmath0 and ned@xmath1@xmath0 systems require an additional @xmath32 type-1 fermi resonance as well as a further @xmath33 type-2 fermi resonance .",
    "in the course of this study , it was found that the quartic terms for the @xmath34 bending mode are unreliable due to the flatness of the pes in this coordinate coupled with only having one , with at most two , significant figures in the quartic force constants . as such",
    ", these terms are dropped from the definition of the pes giving a qff for only the totally - symmetric modes ( the two stretches ) and a cubic force field pes for the pair of degenerate bending modes .",
    "even so , all of the cccr spectroscopic constants of the ground vibrational state are produced in the same manner and , subsequently , the same accuracy as those produced in the previous studies @xcite , since only cubic terms are necessary for the computation of @xmath35 and the other desired spectroscopic constants in the first place @xcite .",
    "additionally , the @xmath36 and @xmath37 frequencies , as well as their vibrationally - averaged rotational constants , are defined and computed in the same procedure as has been previously benchmarked for high accuracy",
    ". the @xmath38 frequency may not be as reliable since its largest contributor to the taylor series definition of the potential is cubic , but this is still an improvement over simple harmonic frequencies and will give some indication as to the rotational structure of this vibrational state .",
    "the vibrational frequencies for this noble gas compound are very different from `` standard '' atoms .",
    "for instance , the @xmath36 h@xmath25h stretch is over half the value of what is known for the stretching motion of hydrogen atom at more than 4000 @xmath20 or less than 2.5 microns @xcite , but actually quite close to the roughly 2000 @xmath20 ( 5.0 microns ) fundamental vibrational frequency of h@xmath1@xmath0 @xcite . as a result of these closely coincidental values",
    ", it is interpreted that the presence of the h@xmath25h bond behaves much like it does in the hydrogen molecular cation , but the neon atom affects this motion to a small degree indicating that some bonding is present .",
    "the @xmath37 ne@xmath25h stretch fundamental is substantially lower than most other heavy atom to hydrogen stretches , which are typically in the 3300 to 3600 @xmath20 ( 2.8 @xmath25 3.0 micron ) region , but the harmonic frequency is many times higher than van der waals ne@xmath25x stretching frequencies @xcite indicating that the ne@xmath25h bond itself is also weak but certainly functional .",
    "finally , the bending motion is also lower than it would be in most purely `` covalent '' structures .",
    "hence , the vibrations of neh@xmath1@xmath0 imply that this molecule is weakly associated but has some level of electron sharing in its stabilization making it more than merely a van der waals complex .",
    "the bond lengths for neh@xmath1@xmath0 further indicate that this molecule is more than a van der waals complex .",
    "the ne@xmath25h bond is longer than other hydrogen bonds of the same period , but much shorter than would be found in purely electrostatic interactions between noble gases and ligands @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium bond lengths remain the same upon isotopomerization since the potential has been formulated , again , within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "similarly , the dipole moment remains unchanged for our set of computations .",
    "the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pv5z dipole moment computed from the centre - of - mass at the origin is very high here at 5.61 d making this cation very rotationally bright regardless of the isotopologue examined .",
    "the @xmath39 vibrationally - averaged bond lengths are affected by the differences in the various isotopic masses as shown in tables [ ne20 ] and [ ne22 ] which , in turn , influence the @xmath40-type rotational constants . inclusion of the @xmath8ne over @xmath7ne lowers @xmath35 by 554.0 mhz , which will produce noticeably different rotational spectra at high enough resolution , but the near doubling of the hydrogen masses upon deuteration will have a much greater effect on any observed rotational lines . also from the tables ,",
    "the vibrational modes are all affected by isotopic shifts that further affects the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 constants giving new rotational structure for the vibrationally excited states .",
    "the force constants for @xmath29 arh@xmath1@xmath0 are given in table [ arfc ] including , again , all positive second derivatives .",
    "argon has three stable isotopes : @xmath9ar , @xmath10ar , and @xmath11ar .",
    "@xmath9arh@xmath0 was detected in the crab nebula @xcite , even though @xmath11ar is the more abundant isotope on earth .",
    "the reasons for the difference in abundances of the two isotopes have been well documented @xcite , but inclusion of all three forms of argon is warranted in this study for the sake of completeness . the structural , spectroscopic , and vibrational values for the twelve different isotopologues ( including deuteration )",
    "are given in tables [ ar36 ] , [ ar38 ] , and [ ar40 ] .",
    "the resonances required for the spectro computations are not affected by inclusion of the different argon isotopes .",
    "however , the deuteration affects these necessary inputs since it influences the rovibrational structure of the molecules more noticeably .",
    "no resonances of any kind are needed for arh@xmath1@xmath0 .",
    "the resonances required for arhd@xmath0 include a @xmath30 type-1 fermi resonance , a @xmath31 type-2 fermi resonance , and @xmath44 coriolis resonances .",
    "ardh@xmath0 is reliant upon @xmath45 and @xmath32 type-1",
    "fermi resonances , a @xmath33 type-2 fermi resonance , and a @xmath46 darling - dennison resonance .",
    "the ard@xmath1@xmath0 resonances are the same as those for ardh@xmath0 but without the darling - dennison resonance .",
    "a similar issue with the quartic terms of the @xmath34-bending coordinate were also encountered with arh@xmath1@xmath0 leading once again to the use of the cccr qff for the totally - symmetric terms but only the cccr cubic force field for the bending mode(s ) .",
    "the born - oppenheimer dipole moment computed from the centre - of - mass for arh@xmath1@xmath0 is not as high as it is for the neon compound but still quite significant at 4.37 d. the ar@xmath25h bond length is around 1.44   for each isotopologue , which is about 0.1   longer than another set of third - row atom containing compounds , @xmath47- and @xmath48-hsco , where the s@xmath25h bond lengths are 1.34 - 1.35   @xcite .",
    "even so , it is still in the range of fairly well bonded hydrogen atoms for larger atoms of this size and can not be interpreted as a van der waals complex , even though the equilibrium h@xmath25h bond length of 1.110   is very close to the 1.053   bond length in h@xmath1@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the anharmonic vibrational frequencies for the arh@xmath1@xmath0 isotopologues are significantly less than their neon - containing counterparts , as one would expect for inclusion of a heavier atom@xmath25argon in this case .",
    "however , the decrease in the h@xmath25h stretch from 1801.5 @xmath20 ( 5.551 microns ) in the standard isotopologue of neh@xmath1@xmath0 to 1229.8 @xmath20 ( 8.131 microns ) in @xmath9arh@xmath1@xmath0 indicates that this bond is even more perturbed by the presence of the argon than the neon when compared to mere h@xmath1@xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath37 ar@xmath25h stretch is 201.7 @xmath20 less at 590.5 @xmath20 ( 16.93 microns ) than the @xmath7neh@xmath1@xmath0 @xmath37 ne@xmath25h stretch .",
    "however , this mode is strongly anharmonic for arh@xmath1@xmath0 , where the anharmonicities are on the order of 500 @xmath20 .",
    "single deuteration of the terminal hydrogen significantly reduces the anharmonicities , on the order of a half , and the ardh@xmath0 @xmath37 stretches are almost harmonic in comparison .",
    "also , the @xmath37 ar@xmath25h stretch is significantly lower in arh@xmath1@xmath0 than it is in arh@xmath0 where the frequency is 2592.65 @xmath20 or 3.857 microns @xcite indicating that the ar@xmath25h bond is stronger in the diatomic cation than it is in arh@xmath1@xmath0 .",
    "however , the 590.5 @xmath20 @xmath37 ar@xmath25h stretch is notably higher than the comparable 350 @xmath20 ar@xmath25h@xmath1 stretch observed for the arh@xmath1 neutral van der waals complex @xcite .",
    "the exception to the decrease in frequency for the arh@xmath1@xmath0 fundamentals as compared to neh@xmath1@xmath0 is the @xmath34-bending mode . for the standard isotopologue ,",
    "the neh@xmath1@xmath0 bending mode is 98.5 @xmath20 less than its @xmath9arh@xmath1@xmath0 counterpart .",
    "however , again , the lack of quartic terms in these descriptions does not lend strong credence to any conclusions taken about these modes besides a general location as to where these bending frequencies can be found .",
    "the vibrational frequencies indicate that arh@xmath1@xmath0 is not quite as strongly bound as arh@xmath0 but is more strongly associated than neutral arh@xmath1 .",
    "this is corroborated by the force constants , which , according to badger s law , indicate bond strength since it is proportional to the force constant of the vibration . from table [ arfc ]",
    ", the @xmath49 force constant corresponds to the ar@xmath25h stretch and is 1.895 279 mdyn /  . using the harmonic approximation from the vibrational frequency derived by @xcite",
    "( 2592.65 @xmath20 ) , the arh@xmath0 force constant is 3.883 866 mdyn /  , nearly double that in arh@xmath1@xmath0 .",
    "concurrently , the @xmath50 force constant is 0.700 608 mdyn /   indicating that the h@xmath25h bond is half as strong as it is in h@xmath1@xmath0 , where the harmonic force constant is 1.425 879 mdyn /   from a 2191.13 @xmath20 frequency @xcite .",
    "regardless of the strength of the bonds and the degree to which electrons are shared between the ar atom and the h@xmath1@xmath0 cation , the rotational constants and other spectroscopic data for arh@xmath1@xmath0 as provided in tables [ ar36 ] , [ ar38 ] , and [ ar40 ] can be applied to spectral analysis of the ism or simulated laboratory experiments .",
    "the main question regarding the detectability of these compounds in the ism or their presence in interstellar chemical pathways is whether or not these structures are stable and , if so , by how much . since",
    "zero gradients are determined along with positive second derivates ( see tables [ nefc ] and [ arfc ] ) these structures are minima on their respective potential surfaces .",
    "in fact , these @xmath29 linear structures are the global minima on their respective pess . in table",
    "[ diss ] , the major possible dissociation pathways are listed for each noble gas molecule with energies provided relative to each triatomic minimum . according to `` gold standard '' @xcite ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz computations ,",
    "the most likely direct dissociation pathway for neh@xmath1@xmath0 is into the ne atom and the hydrogen molecular cation .",
    "the neh@xmath1@xmath0 minimum sits 0.560 ev below these two products .",
    "all the fundamental vibrational frequencies are below this value showing that vibrational transitions , in addition to pure rotational spectra , can be detected for this system if the conditions are correct for its interstellar formation .",
    "the next - lowest dissociation pathway is for neh@xmath1@xmath0 to lose a hydrogen atom to form neh@xmath0 , but this costs nearly twice as much energy at 1.031 ev .",
    "this closely mirrors the previous ne + h@xmath1@xmath51 neh@xmath0 + h pes computed by @xcite and shown in figure 1 therein .",
    "the energetics of these two pathways are reversed for arh@xmath1@xmath0 , which is the global minimum on its pes .",
    "the lowest energy dissociation pathway is , again from table [ diss ] , into arh@xmath0 and a hydrogen atom where only 0.493 ev is required to break the triatomic noble gas cation down .",
    "the dissociation into the ar atom and hydrogen molecular cation is much higher at 1.838 ev and further breakdown into ar + h + h@xmath0 requires another 2.429 ev , comparable to 2.634 ev predicted by @xcite with a lower level of theory . since the most likely way for arh@xmath1@xmath0 to dissociate , and do so by a wide margain , is to form arh@xmath0 and a hydrogen atom , it seems likely that arh@xmath1@xmath0 is a precursor to the formation of arh@xmath0 in the arh@xmath0 + h@xmath1 pes .",
    "since this dissociation energy corresponds to an equivalent temperature of 5725.7 k , hot regions like the crab nebula where arh@xmath0 has been detected should see arh@xmath1@xmath0 break down fairly easily into the previously detected arh@xmath0 diatomic cation .",
    "cooler regions , such as molecular clouds , should retain a fair amount of arh@xmath1@xmath0 before dissociation into arh@xmath0 .",
    "[ arpes ]    therefore , it is plausible that arh@xmath0 forms , at least in part , from arh@xmath1@xmath0 in the ism",
    ". it may be that arh@xmath1@xmath0 is the necessary stable or semi - stable intermediate in the ar@xmath52 mechanism as proposed by @xcite since formation of arh@xmath1@xmath0 from ar@xmath13 produces 1.930 ev ( see table [ diss ] ) of energy whereas direct , bimolecular dissociation produces 1.436 ev .",
    "granted , 0.493 ev must be imparted into the system to break arh@xmath1@xmath0 down into arh@xmath53 , but this stabilization brought about by the presence of arh@xmath1@xmath0 in the reaction scheme may speed up the formation of arh@xmath0 in the ism . additionally , the role of arh@xmath1@xmath0 may also be an intermediate in the alternative @xmath54 mechanism , as well , which is slightly more energetically favorable at 1.838 ev above the arh@xmath1@xmath0 minimum .",
    "these possible reactions schemes are depicted in figure [ arpes ] .",
    "additionally , arh@xmath1@xmath0 may even be a simple degradation precursor to arh@xmath0 in cool environments after collision with another body .",
    "regardless , arh@xmath1@xmath0 should be detectable , even if in small amounts as it would be functioning as an intermediate , due to its large dipole moment .",
    "finally , neh@xmath0 will probably not be as abundant as arh@xmath0 as has been shown recently @xcite .",
    "the most probable dissociation pathway for neh@xmath1@xmath0 is into ne and h@xmath1@xmath0 , as depicted in figure [ nepes ] corroborating previous work on this pes @xcite , making any potential neh@xmath0 detection unlikely .",
    "this is especially true if the ne@xmath55 reaction is necessary to create neh@xmath0 as it has been suggested for ar@xmath13 to form arh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "[ nepes ]    if detected as a stable species in its own right , arh@xmath1@xmath0 could also serve as a contributing factor indicating the temperature of a given warm astronomical environment since it should dissociate around 5700 k. even though its most likely dissociation energy is at an equivalent temperature of 6500 k , neh@xmath1@xmath0 is not as flexible for use as a thermometer .",
    "again , its primary dissociation pathway is into the neutral noble gas atom and h@xmath1@xmath0 .",
    "no rotationally bright product is created that could be interpreted as unique to neh@xmath1@xmath0 dissociation as it is in arh@xmath1@xmath56 .",
    "[ arrot40 ]    the rotational spectra of neh@xmath1@xmath0 and arh@xmath1@xmath0 can be produced from the spectroscopic data provided herein .",
    "due to its potential relationship of arh@xmath1@xmath0 to arh@xmath0 , the rotational spectrum of neh@xmath1@xmath0 is left to the reader to deduce .",
    "the natural @xmath57 $ ] ratio of roughly 5.25 should produce a sizable intensity for the rotational transitions of the heavier isotopologue of arh@xmath1@xmath0 in addition to the stronger @xmath9arh@xmath1@xmath0 rotational lines .",
    "figure [ arrot40 ] demonstrates what the full rotational spectrum for arh@xmath1@xmath0 should look like at 40 k with the intensities of @xmath9arh@xmath1@xmath0 normalized and the intensities of @xmath10arh@xmath1@xmath0 scaled from the permanent dipole moment and the relative natural abudnance of @xmath10ar .",
    "the simple model linear rotor for inclusion of up to sextic distortion , @xmath58 ,    \\label{ej}\\ ] ] is employed here within the pgopher @xcite program making use of the spectroscopic constants given in tables [ ar36 ] and [ ar38 ] .",
    "transitions up to the @xmath59 line located just around 1.2 thz should be visible , but the @xmath60 line appears to be the brightest at these temperatures .",
    "[ arrot5000 ]    at temperatures closer to that found in the crab nebula or similar environments , the spectrum changes markedly , as depicted in figure [ arrot5000 ] for 5000 k. in addition to the increase in the number of pure rotational lines present , the vibrationally excited states are substantially more populated at this temperature with boltzmann proportions of 0.71 , 0.84 , and 0.83 , respective of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , normalized to the pure rotational transitions . as such , the spectrum becomes more complicated in this idealized depiction .",
    "the @xmath61 transition is the brightest at this temperature and should be found in the 4.9 thz range .",
    "the spin - orbit peak splitting present in such radicals is not modeled here due to limitations in our methodology but would be a further factor in the interstellar detection of these noble gas - containing triatomic cations regardless of the environmental temperatures .    to aid in experimental characterization ,",
    "the pure rotational line list for @xmath62 of the most abundant isotopes of argon , @xmath9ar and @xmath10ar , is given in table [ lll ] to complement figures [ arrot40 ] and [ arrot5000 ] .",
    "experience has shown that the rotational constants may vary from experiment by 10 - 25 mhz .",
    "as such the variance from experiment for the lines listed here will grow for higher @xmath63 , but the relative transition frequencies and the relative intensities will , no doubt , benefit searches for this noble gas cation .",
    "the rotational and rovibrational spectroscopic data provided here should assist in the potential detection of neh@xmath1@xmath0 and arh@xmath1@xmath0 in the ism .",

    "since the @xmath34-bending mode could not fully employ this same approach , the spectroscopic data generated by the cubic force field will certainly provide deeper insight into the vibrational and rovibrational nature of the @xmath38 modes than harmonically derived values can .",
    "the bond lengths and vibrational frequencies show clear demarkation from simple van der waals complexes for these two noble gas cations . neh@xmath1@xmath0 and arh@xmath1@xmath0 are more covalent in nature but can not be considered purely covalent .",
    "both species exhibit large dipole moments that should make them more easily detected than other `` trace '' species in the ism .    additionally , the different lowest - energy ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz dissociation pathways of neh@xmath1@xmath0 into ne and h@xmath1@xmath0 with arh@xmath1@xmath0 into arh@xmath0 and h showcase the differences in the two noble gas atoms .",
    "it is therefore likely that arh@xmath1@xmath0 is a precursor to arh@xmath0 as a reaction intermediate between ar + h@xmath1@xmath0 or ar@xmath13 where arh@xmath0 and a hydrogen atom are the major products . in either case , arh@xmath1@xmath0 is the global minimum on the pes .",
    "if arh@xmath1@xmath0 is involved in the formation of arh@xmath0 , it is unlikely , then , that neh@xmath0 will form in the ism in a similar fashion since this is not the most energetically favorable pathway . as a result ,",
    "detection of the neon hydride cation is doubtful as recent surveys have shown @xcite .",
    "regardless , the reference data provided here , including the rotational spectra , should assist in analysis of the noble gas chemistry of the crab nebula where arh@xmath0 has been detected or in other regions in which other noble gas compounds may be observed .",
