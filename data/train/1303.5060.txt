    "the current concordance cosmology , in which structure formation proceeds in a hierarchal manner driven by pressureless cold dark matter ( cdm ) , has been remarkably successful in explaining the observed properties of large - scale structures in the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    ", there are still some discrepancies between standard @xmath10cdm and observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , n - body simulations predict more satellite galaxies than are observed both around our galaxy ( the so - called `` missing satellite problem '' ; ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ) , and in the field as recently noted by the alfalfa survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , simulations of the most massive galactic cdm subhaloes are too centrally condensed to be consistent with the kinematic data of the bright milky way satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , observations of small galaxies show that their central density profile is shallower than predicted by cdm n - body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "baryonic feedback is a popular prescription for resolving such discrepancies .",
    "feedback caused by supernovae ( sne ) explosions and heating due to the uv background may suppress the baryonic content of low - mass haloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and make their inner density profile shallower ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , accurately matching observations is still difficult even when tuning feedback recipes ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    an alternative explanation might be found if dark matter ( dm ) consisted of lower mass ( @xmath8kev ) particles and thus was `` warm '' ( wdm ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting effective pressure and free - streaming would decrease structure on small - scales , though again fine - tuning might be required to fully match all the observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most powerful testbed for these scenarios is the high - redshift universe .",
    "structure formation in wdm models ( or in any cosmological model with an equivalent power - spectrum cut - off ) is exponentially suppressed on small - scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "_ the current data , including many redshift measurements , allows us to perform an improved statistical analysis by directly comparing the distribution of bursts in various models as a function of redshift .",
    "furthermore , we make more conservative assumptions throughout the analysis , such as normalizing the sfr - grb ratio at high redshifts ( thereby using a shorter , more accurate lever arm which minimizes modeling uncertainty ) , using an unbiased luminosity function and allowing the sfr - grb ratio to evolve with redshift . finally , we study the effectiveness of future observations in improving the current constraints .",
    "current limits on dark matter masses , @xmath0 , are motivated by several observations .",
    "the lyman-@xmath5 forest implies @xmath13 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath14 8 kev for sterile neutrinos @xcite . likewise",
    ", wdm models with a too warm candidate ( @xmath15 kev ) can not simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass function and the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "also , the fact that reionization occurred at @xmath16 implies @xmath17 kev @xcite .",
    "however , all of these limits are strongly affected by a degeneracy between astrophysical ( i.e. baryonic ) processes and the dark matter mass .",
    "our approach in this work is more robust , driven only by the shape of the redshift evolution of the @xmath2 sfr .",
    "furthermore , it is important to note that the sfr is exponentially attenuated at high - redshifts in wdm models . since astrophysical uncertainties are unable to mimic such a rapid suppression , probes at high - redshifts ( such as grbs and reionization ) are powerful in constraining wdm cosmologies .",
