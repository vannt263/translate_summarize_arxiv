    "two decades ago bender and boettcher have found that a broad family of non - hermitian hamiltonians can exhibit entirely real spectra as long as these hamiltonians have parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "one distinguishing feature of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians is the existence of spontaneous symmetry breaking , corresponding to a transition from real to complex spectra @xcite .",
    "since then , numerious @xmath0-symmetric systems have been explored in several fields , from the complex extension of quantum mechanics @xcite , to the quantum field theories and mathematical physics @xcite , open quantum systems @xcite , the anderson models for disorder systems @xcite , the optical systems with complex refractive indices @xcite , and the topological insulators @xcite .    in recent years , the non - hermitian lattice models with @xmath0 symmetry have been extensively studied , which is stimulated by their experimental realizations in optical waveguides @xcite , optical lattices @xcite , and in a pair of coupled _ lrc _ circuits @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the lattice models can exhibit rich physical phenomena due to the availability of exact solutions and the tractability of numerical and analytical calculations .",
    "quiet recently , the non - hermitian lattice models with @xmath0 symmetry have been studied in different systems , such as gegenbauer - polynomial quantum chain @xcite , one - dimensional @xmath0-symmetric chain with disorder @xcite , the chain model with two conjugated imaginary potentials at two end sites @xcite , the tight - binding model with position - dependent hopping amplitude @xcite , and the time - periodic @xmath0-symmetric lattice model @xcite .",
    "it is noted that many works have focused on the @xmath0 phase diagram and signatures of @xmath0-symmetry breaking in the lattice model , while much less attention has been paid to the transport properties @xcite and the associated quantum phase interference effects in the non - hermitian lattice model with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the transport properties of simple one- and quasi - one - dimensional model systems have been investigated with keen interest over the past two decades , which is due to the rapid advance of nanofabrication and detection techniques .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena in novel transport properties of such systems is the fano resonance @xcite , which is characterized as a sharp asymmetric profile in transmission line , arising from the quantum interference between the discrete energy level and the continuum spectrum ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "interest in studying the fano resonance is driven by its high sensitivity to the details of the scattering process , which shows the information of the scattering center .    the simplest model which reveals the underlying physics of coupling between the discrete states and the continuum spectrum is the fano - anderson model @xcite .",
    "this model consists of a subsystem of an infinite linear main chain with the nearest - neighbor hopping which fertilizes the continuum spectrum , and a subsystem of several side - coupled discrete energy defects .",
    "these two subsystems are coupled at some joint sites by the hopping .",
    "many attempts have been made to affect the scattering process and tune the transmission lineshape , including trying different geometric structure of defects @xcite , changing the numbers of defects , adding the impurities @xcite , or introducing the nonlinearity @xcite to the subsystems . as another kind of interaction factor , the non - hermitian terms may provide an interesting method to control and engineer the transmission lineshapes @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the transmission properties and the associated interference effect in two kinds of generalized non - hermitian fano - anderson models .",
    "the models consist of an infinite linear main chain and two side - coupled defects with the @xmath0-symmetric complex on - site chemical potentials .",
    "it is found that these systems exhibit typical fano resonance in the hermitian case , and the perfect reflection appears when the incoming frequency equals to the resonance energy , which is accompanied by an abrupt @xmath2-jump of the scattering phase @xcite . while in the case of @xmath0-symmetric complex chemical potential , the transmission lineshape is shifted and tuned , and",
    "perfect transmission occurs when the the incoming frequency equals to the real part of the complex potential of the defects . particularly in model ( b ) ( as shown in fig.1 ) , we find that the resonance energy for perfect reflection is exact the real part of the complex potential , which indicates the perfect reflection in the absence of non - hermitian term is changed to the perfect transmission at this frequency when the @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian potentials is acting .",
    "we show that the summation of transmission and reflection coefficients equals to @xmath3 exactly under the @xmath0-symmetric condition , i. e. , the scattering process is similar to a hermitian system due to the balanced gain and loss .",
    "the transport properties under the non-@xmath0-symmetric conditions are also calculated numerically , and the results show that the asymmetric fano - type transmission profile is destroyed and the transmittance ( reflectivity ) can be larger than 1 as a result of imbalance of gain and loss , which indicates the instability of the process .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec . , we present the generalized non - hermitian fano - anderson models and show the fano resonance in a hermitian version . in sec . , we study the scattering process of these two models , obtain the analytical form of transmission coefficient and discuss the interplay between @xmath0 symmetry and fano resonance",
    ". a summary is given in sec . .",
    "we consider the generalized non - hermitian fano - anderson model which consists of a linear main chain and two side - coupled defects with @xmath0-symmetric complex on - site chemical potentials . as schematically displayed in fig .",

    "1(b ) , two typical models are studied in the present work , which differ from each other by the kind of couplings to the main chain . the model shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) can be described by the hamiltonian    -symmetric complex on - site chemical potentials .",
    "the couplings between different states are indicated by the black arrows.,width=302 ]    @xmath4    and the model in fig .",
    "1(b ) can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denotes the annihilation ( creation ) operator for annihilating ( creating ) a mode state @xmath8 at site @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) the annihilation ( creation ) operator for annihilating ( creating ) a local mode at the side site @xmath12 .",
    "these two models describe the interaction of two subsystems .",
    "one is an infinite isotropic tight - binding chain with amplitude @xmath13 at site @xmath9 , and @xmath14 is the nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "this subsystem provides the fluent channel of the continuum spectrum for the propagation of plane waves with dispersion @xmath15 .",
    "the other subsystem consists of two side - coupled defects with complex on - site chemical potentials , providing additional pathes for propagation .",
    "these two defects interact with the main chain at joint site @xmath16 and @xmath3 with the hopping amplitude @xmath17 in the model ( a ) or at site @xmath16 only with the hopping amplitude @xmath18 in the model ( b ) .    in discrete systems , @xmath19 and @xmath20",

    "<S> we study the effect of @xmath0-symmetric complex potentials on the transport properties of non - hermitian systems , which consist of an infinite linear chain and two side - coupled defect points with @xmath0-symmetric complex on - site potentials . by analytically solving the scattering problem of two typical models , </S>",
    "<S> which display standard fano resonances in the absence of non - hermitian terms , we find that the @xmath0-symmetric imaginary potentials can lead to some pronounced effects on transport properties of our systems , including changes from the perfect reflection to perfect transmission , and rich behaviors for the absence or existence of the prefect reflection at one and two resonant frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> our study can help us to understand the interplay between the fano resonance and @xmath1 symmetry in non - hermitian discrete systems , which may be realizable in optical waveguide experiments . </S>"
