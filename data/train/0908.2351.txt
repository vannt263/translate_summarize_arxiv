    "there repulsion is achieved by filling the space between the bodies with a medium with a precisely chosen dielectric permittivity .",
    "it was experimentally shown  @xcite for short separations ( @xmath050 nm ) that repulsive van der waals forces between specially chosen dielectrics with intervening liquids of low - polarity ( eg .",
    "cyclohexane , ethanol , or bromobenzene ) agree with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory including the retardation contribution .",
    "the repulsive casimir forces at large separations up to several hundred nanometers have not been experimentally studied until very recently  @xcite    the setup is the following .",
    "two surfaces 1 and 3 with dielectric permittivities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are separated by a gap filled by medium 2 with dielectric permittivity @xmath3 . in recent experiments or proposals",
    "medium 2 is a liquid , ethanol  @xcite or bromobenzene  @xcite while the two surfaces are made of silica and gold . in order to obtain a repulsive force",

    "@xmath18 plugging them into ( [ eq1 ] ) one gets a rough estimation of the force at large plates separations  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check numerically that if the materials obey ( [ condition ] ) , especially at low frequencies , the force is repulsive in the long distance limit .",
    "these considerations help to choose the materials for the devices based on repulsive casimir forces  @xcite .",
    "however the origin of this repulsion itself is not quite clear .    in the following",
    "we will consider this question in relation with surface modes .",
    "the electromagnetic quantum fluctuations which give rise to the casimir effect obey the maxwell equations .",
    "the corresponding boundary - value problem has two types of solutions : the propagative waves , which will be called photonic modes in the following , and the waves living on the interfaces and exponentially decaying outwards .",
    "these surface modes exist only in the tm polarization .",

    "a comparison between this calculation and the predictions of our model system allows to define the limitations of the latter .",

    "the distance is normalized by the largest plasma wavelength in the system , @xmath77 .",
    "the plot shows the reduction factor which is the ratio of the plasmon vacuum energy and the casimir energy of perfectly conducting plates , @xmath78 .",
    "as the casimir force between perfectly conducting plates is attractive , a negative or positive reduction factor corresponds to repulsion or attraction respectively . for the energies ,",
    "the arguments goes in the opposite way .",
    "the energy of the antisymmetric plasmon @xmath79 is positive , corresponding to repulsion with a negative reduction factor , while the energy of the symmetric plasmon @xmath42 is negative yielding attraction and thus a positive reduction factor .",
    "the antisymmetric plasmon dominates at short distances , while the symmetric plasmon makes decisive contribution at larger separations .",
    "thus the total plasmon interaction is repulsive at short separations and attractive at medium and long distances .",
    "here we estimate the length scale with respect to @xmath80 .    in @xcite , it was shown that for two plates separated by vacuum the attractive casimir energy is a result of cancelations between plasmon and photon contributions at all distances .",
    "moreover the plasmon and photon energies have different signs and decrease more slowly with distance ( @xmath81 ) than the total energy ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "fig.[fig2](b ) shows the reduction factor for the total casimir energy when condition  ( [ condition ] ) is met .",
    "clearly it is negative at all distances corresponding to a repulsive casimir interaction .",

    "the photon contribution prevails assuring repulsion . at distances large with respect to @xmath80 the energy decreases as @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the decrease is much steeper than in any set - up yielding attraction .",
    "the attraction of the surface plasmons at short ranges explains the sign and the magnitude of the casimir force between plates separated by vacuum ( or any material with @xmath33 ) . in the following",
    "we will show that under the condition ( [ condition ] ) the surface plasmons produce a repulsive contribution at short distances .",

    "thus , the vacuum energy of the interacting surface plasmons is positive corresponding to repulsion .",
    "let us now compare the repulsive force due to the interaction of the surface modes obtained in the plasma model with the corresponding total casimir force calculated according to the zero temperature lifshitz formula  ( [ eq1 ] ) .",

    "the calculation is done for tree layers with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( solid line ) . at short distances",
    "the force coincides with the short distance asymptote of the interacting surface plasmons , @xmath100 , @xmath101 ( dotted line ) . at long distances ( @xmath102 )",
    "the force is repulsive and decays much faster than the force between two plates separated by vacuum , @xmath103 , where @xmath26 is the plasma frequency of the material filling the gap .",
    "this behavior is explained by the divergence of @xmath3 for @xmath104 within the plasma model .",
    "if dielectric function of the intermediate material 2 is finite at low frequencies , the reduction factor saturates at large distances .",
    "an example of a more realistic set - up is the system silica - bromobenzene - gold .",
    "repulsive dispersion forces in a similar system were measured by  @xcite at short distances , the results appeared to be consistent with the calculated non - retarded hamaker constants .",
    "precisely the same system was studied in a recent experiment  @xcite at separations from 20 nm to several hundred nanometers . here",
    "we do not consider separations larger than 300 nm , so that we need not to account for temperature corrections .",

    "the condition  ( [ condition ] ) is satisfied for @xmath118rad / s , where @xmath119 . for @xmath120rad / s , @xmath121 .",
    "both regions contribute to repulsion _ within the two oscillator model for bromobenzene and silica_. the applicability of this model is discussed in  @xcite .    in the present situation",
    "the solutions of  ( [ eq_plasm ] ) are interacting surface polaritons . at close separations realized by a thin layer of bromobenzene , where the decisive contribution to the force comes from large wave vectors and high frequencies , the absorbtion is negligible , and the models used for the materials are reduced to the plasma model with effective plasma frequency @xmath122^{1/2}_i$ ] , @xmath109 , @xmath123 .",
    "we find @xmath124rad / c , @xmath125rad / c .    at close separation",
    "the surface polaritons turn into surface plasmons , and the formulae  ( [ plasm_nonid_short]-[energy_plasm_short1 ] ) for the the interacting surface plasmons become valid .",
    "but one should keep in mind that they describe correctly only short distance regime . substituting @xmath126 , @xmath127 , we get @xmath128 , where @xmath129 nm is the effective plasma wavelength for the composed system . in this regime",
    "the reduction factor for the interacting surface modes is negative yielding repulsion .",
    "it coincides with the total reduction factor for the force at short distances .    at medium and low frequencies the dielectric functions of the materials are complex , and",
    "the calculation of the vacuum energy corresponding to the surface modes is not so straightforward .",
    "the total reduction factor for the force is shown as the dashed line in fig.3 .",
    "clearly repulsion sets in for distances of the order of or larger than the effective plasma frequency while the toy model gives repulsion essentially for distances much smaller than that and gives a negligible force for larger distances .",
    "in contrast at large distances our calculation using the two oscillator model yields a negative force with a reduction factor which reaches @xmath130 . within the plasma model the reduction factor decays exponentially , while within the two oscillator model it tends to a constant .",
    "this shows that the repulsion at large distances does not have its origin in the interaction between surface modes but stems from the repulsive contribution of propagating modes .",
    "the dotted lines are the short distance plasmon approximations to the model system and for the realistic dielectric response functions .",
    "for the latter the plasmon approximation turns out to be valid for distances up to twice the effective plasma wavelength , that is about 170 nm .",
    "indeed , the present calculation does not pretend to be a precise description of the recent experiment  @xcite , but the system @xmath131 is used as an illustration .",
    "the calculation of the casimir force at zero temperature for the solid - liquid - solid system using measured dielectric functions of all involved materials for the wavelength range from millimeters down to subnanometers was carried out in  @xcite , which was submitted simultaneously to the present paper .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the casimir force in the systems which meet the condition  ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the force in the present setup is small .",
    "for example , in the system @xmath132 , with the 150 nm layer of bromobenzene , it is only about 5% of the force between gold covered plates in vacuum .    from previous studies  @xcite we remember that when two plates in vacuum form a cavity , the total energy of the coupled surface modes is negative , corresponding to attraction .",
    "we have shown that within the plasma model the surface modes repel at short distances when the materials satisfy the condition  ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "moreover the casimir repulsion is then completely due to the repulsion of the surface modes . at medium and long distances",
    "the interaction of the surface modes becomes attractive , but the dominating repulsive contribution of the propagative modes leads to a total repulsive force ."
