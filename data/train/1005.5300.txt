    "ground - based transit surveys have been very successful at discovering short - period ( @xmath21  days ) transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) since 2006 . because of the short duration of transit events ( relative to the orbital period ) , candidates are more likely to be identified by higher duty cycle observations .",
    "the situation is especially demanding toward longer orbital periods , where the observational constraint couples with the considerably lower incidence rates of preferred orbital plane inclinations . the only way we can increase the probability of discovering long - period teps from the ground is to increase the duty cycle by establishing telescope networks spread in geographical longitude .",
    "surveys such as watts / tres and hatnet are designed with this goal in mind .",
    "for example , in the particular case of watts / tres @xcite , for a typical observing season , the detection probability of a 10  day period tep from a single observing site is 15% .",
    "this increases to 10% by using two sites of the network .",
    "it is clear that discovering long - period teps with ground - based surveys involves a large degree of serendipity even in the case of multisite observations .    in large part due to",
    "observational selection effects , from the more than @xmath22 teps known today , there are only 6 planets with orbital periods longer than 6  days .",
    "three of them ( corot-4b , 6b and 9b , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were discovered by the corot mission ; two , hd  17156b @xcite , and hd  80606b ( * ? ?",
    "* , * ? ? ?",
    "* , * ? ? ?",
    "* and ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) came from the photometric followup observations of already known planets from radial velocity ( rv ) surveys .",
    "the only long - period planet originally discovered by a ground - based photometric survey is wasp-8b @xcite , with a period of @xmath23  days .",
    "the period distribution of teps , displayed in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : pdistr ] , shows the very sparse population of teps above @xmath24  days ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "interestingly , there are also relatively few radial velocity ( rv ) planets discovered in the period interval of @xmath17@xmath26  days ( top panel ) .",
    "the depletion of planets in this regime can be explained by the stellar - mass - dependent lifetime of the protoplanetary disk and its effect on migration ( * ? ? ? * and ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 10.86  day period planet hat - p-15b was discovered by the hungarian - made automated telescope network ( hatnet ; * ? ? ?",
    "operational since 2003 , it has covered approximately 11% of the northern sky , searching for teps around bright stars ( @xmath27mag ) .",
    "hatnet employs six wide field instruments : four at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) in arizona , and two on the roof of the submillimeter array hangar ( sma ) of sao in hawaii . since 2006",
    ", hatnet has announced and published 14 teps .",
    "this work describes the fifteenth such discovery , the first tep with a period above @xmath17  days discovered by a ground - based photometric survey .",
    "the transits of hat - p-15b were detected with the hat-6 telescope in arizona and the hat-9 telescope in hawaii .",
    "the region around gsc  2883 - 01687 , a field internally labeled as g170 , was observed on a nightly basis between 2005 september and 2006 february , whenever weather conditions permitted .",
    "we gathered 8538 images with an exposure time of 5 minutes and with readout time and other operations yielding a 5.5 minute cadence .",
    "each image contained approximately 55,000 stars down to @xmath28  mag .",
    "for the brightest stars in the field , we achieved a per - image photometric precision of 2.5mmag .",
    "the calibration of the hatnet frames was performed by utilizing standard procedures as described in our earlier papers . in brief , star detection , astrometry and aperture photometry",
    "were performed on the calibrated images by using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog @xcite and the astrometric routine of @xcite .",
    "the resulting light curves  were decorrelated from systematics using the external parameter decorrelation technique ( epd , * ? ? ? * ) and the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa , * ? ? ?",
    "the light curves were searched for periodic box - like signals using the box least - squares method ( bls , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we detected a significant signal in the light curve of gsc  2883 - 01687 ( hat - p-15 , also known as 2mass  04245952 + 3927382 ; @xmath29@xmath30 , @xmath31@xmath32 ; j2000 ; @xmath012.16 ; @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : hatnet - spec ] , the detection of hat - p-15 is clear , in spite of its long period .",
    "the occurrence of subharmonic and harmonic components is an artefact of bls ( or any other phase - folding period search algorithms with arbitrary signal shape ) , and indicates the significance of the detection . during the total time span of 135  days",
    ", we had three transit events with nearly full , and two more with very limited transit coverages , comprising altogether some 130 data points within the transit . except for one marginally overlapping event ,",
    "all of them were separately caught by hat-6 and hat-9 , stressing the importance of using a network in the search for long - period teps .",
    "we searched for additional components in the signal by subtracting the best - fitting trapezoidal signal corresponding to the peak frequency of the above bls analysis .",
    "we did not find any component ( transit [ bls ] or fourier [ dft ] ) that appeared significant .",
    "the null result for the dft search is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : hatnet - spec ] . in agreement with the low chromospheric activity suggested by the spectroscopic data ( see ) we can exclude any coherent fourier signal above @xmath33  mmag .",
    "figure  [ fig : hatnet ] shows the folded hatnet light curve , on which is superposed the model fit to be discussed in .",
    "the flat out - of - transit part of the light curve confirms the null result on the presence of additional components , in particular of those with periods commensurable with the orbital periods ( secondary eclipse or ellipsoidal variation , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which might suggest a blended eclipsing binary .",
    "the derived transit parameters of the hatnet light curve are also in good agreement with the considerably more accurate followup data to be presented in .",
    "we obtained a period of @xmath34  days , a moment of transit center of @xmath35  [ hjd ] , a relative transit duration ( first to last contact divided by the period ) of @xmath36 and a transit depth of @xmath37  mag .",
    "the hatnet light curve also predicts a short ingress time of @xmath38  days , again consistent with the followup data . in spite of the relatively large @xmath39 statistical errors quoted , by using the hatnet ephemeris we get a difference of only @xmath40  days between the transit time predicted from the hatnet light curve and that observed from the followup data ( and table  [ tab : planetparam ] ) .      the first step in our follow - up investigation of planet host candidates is usually to gather low - s / n ,",
    "high - resolution spectra to obtain a basic characterization of the host star and exclude obvious blend configurations .",
    "as in most of our earlier works , we used the cfa digital speedometer ( ds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mounted on the  telescope .",
    "for a description of ds for reconnaissance spectroscopy we refer to @xcite .",
    "we obtained @xmath41 ds spectra of hat - p-15 in 2006 spanning @xmath42days .",
    "the rv measurements showed an rms residual of @xmath43@xmath44 . considering that the overall formal error of the individual measurements is the same as the rms , the observations suggest that there is no detectable rv variation above the @xmath44 level .",
    "this rules out a short period stellar companion .",
    "furthermore , the spectra were single - lined , showing no evidence of more than one star in the system .",
    "atmospheric parameters for the star , including the effective temperature @xmath45 , surface gravity @xmath46 , and projected rotational velocity @xmath47 , were derived as described by @xcite .",

    "the mean heliocentric rv of hat - p-15  is @xmath48@xmath44 .",

    "figure  [ fig : rvbis ] shows that the bs distribution as a function of orbital phase is nearly flat , except for several low points whose deviations are apparently not correlated either with the rv residuals or with the activity index .",
    "following our earlier work related to the verification of hat - p-12b @xcite we investigated the contamination caused by the moonlight . by adopting the same definition of the sky contamination factor scf as in @xcite , we found a suggestive correlation between scf and bs , but with several outliers .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the simple formula given in @xcite only holds when the rv difference between the moon and the star is greater than the width of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) profile .",
