    "face recognition is currently one of the most popular tasks in computer vision , which has many applications in authentication , security , imaging technology , etc . because of the variations in the images of the same person such as changes in facial expression , pose , viewpoint and lighting conditions",
    ", it could be quite challenging .",
    "a set of face images of one person with changes in facial expression and lighting are shown in figure 1 .",
    "various algorithms have been proposed for face recognition during the past years . despite the huge progress in the development of algorithms that are robust to variations in illumination ,",
    "pose and facial expression , there is still much room to explore for more reliable algorithms .",
    "there have been various approaches for the face recognition problem during past years . among those ,",
    "eigenface is one of popular approaches proposed in 1991 @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the face images are projected to a low - dimensional space using principal component analysis ( pca ) . these principal components which are derived from the training set",
    "are called eigenfaces . in another work , known as fisherfaces @xcite , instead of using pca ,",
    "the author used a class - specific dimensionality reduction algorithm known as linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) . in this approach ,",
    "two covariance matrices are defined , one measures the inter - class variation and the other evaluates the intra - class variation , and the projection matrix is chosen as by maximizing the ratio of inter - class variation to intra - class variation . because lda takes the class label into account , it provides more discriminative power than pca . among more recent approaches ,",
    "there have been a lot of works using sparse representation for face recognition . in @xcite ,",
    "wright used sparse coding for face recognition which achieved a high accuracy rate . in @xcite ,",
    "liu proposed an extended version of sparse - coding where he added a non - negative constraint on the sparse coefficients .",
    "there are also more recent works such as the one in @xcite , @xcite , which uses adaptive or robust sparse representation for face recognition .",
    "there are also many algorithms based on bayesian framework for human face and pose recognition @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there have also been a lot of works using hand - crafted features for face recognition such as using sift , hog , gabor wavelet and curvelet @xcite-@xcite . in a more recent work ,",
    "guo @xcite proposed a face recognition algorithm based on deep tree based structure , which uses a unified representation for multiple tasks , identity recognition , age estimation and facial expression .",
    "+ in this paper , we propose an algorithm which uses a convolutional network called scattering transform / network which provides a multi - layer representation of the signal , and is invariant to translation , small deformation and rotation @xcite .",
    "after derivation of scattering features , their dimensionality is reduced using pca and fed into a multi - class svm to perform classification .",
    "this algorithm has been tested on three face databases and achieved very high accuracy rate .",
    "the proposed algorithm is also fast enough to be used for mobile applications , using energy aware algorithms @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectionii ] provides a description of the scattering features , which are used in this work and also a brief overview of pca .",
    "section [ sectioniii ] contains the explanation of the classification scheme .",
    "the experimental results and comparisons with other works are shown in section [ sectioniv ] and the paper is concluded in section [ sectionv ] .",
    "extracting good features is one of the most important steps in many of computer vision and object recognition tasks . as a result",
    ", a lot of research has been done in designing robust features for a variety of image classification tasks .",
    "good features should be invariant to the transformations which do not change object class .",
    "many image descriptors are proposed in the past two decades , including scale invariant feature transform ( sift ) , histogram of oriented gradient ( hog ) , bag of words ( bow ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , unsupervised feature learning algorithms and deep convolutional neural networks have drawn a lot of attention and achieved state - of - the - art results in many computer vision problems @xcite .",
    "they are shown to provide more abstract and discriminative features which suit better for object recognition task . in @xcite ,",
    "a wavelet - based multi - layer representation is proposed , which is similar to deep convolutional network , where instead of learning the filters and representation , it uses predefined wavelets @xcite .",
    "this algorithm has been successfully applied to digit recognition , texture classification and audio classification problems and achieved state - of - the - art results @xcite .",
    "it has also been used for some biometric recognition tasks such as iris , fingerprint and palmprint recognition @xcite-@xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the application of scattering transform for face recognition is explored .",
    "the details of scattering features and their derivation are presented in the following section .",
    "scattering transformation is a multi - layer representation recently proposed by stephane mallat .",
    "the scattering transformation can be designed such that it is invariant to a group of transformations such as translation , rotation , etc . here a translation - invariant version is used .",
    "it can be shown that the scattering coefficients of the first layer of the scattering network are similar to the sift descriptor , but the coefficients of the higher layers contain the high - frequency information lost in sift @xcite .",
    "the scattering transform coefficients of each layer can be computed with a cascade of three operations : wavelet decompositions , complex modulus and local averaging .    for a given signal @xmath0 we can derive its scattering representation as follows .",
    "the first scattering coefficient is just the averaged signal which can be obtained by convolving the signal with the averaging filter @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "then the scattering coefficients of the first layer are obtained by applying wavelet transforms of different scales and orientations , taking the magnitude of wavelet coefficients and convolving it by the averaging filter @xmath1 as shown below : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the scale and orientation respectively . by taking the magnitude of the wavelet",
    ", we can make these coefficients invariant to local translation . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the high - frequency information of the signal will be lost by averaging .",
    "we can recover some of the lost information by convolving the term @xmath6 by another set of wavelets at scale @xmath7 , taking the absolute value of wavelet followed by averaging as : @xmath8 it is enough to only calculate the coefficients for @xmath9 , since @xmath10 is negligible for scales where @xmath11 .",
    "we can continue this procedure to obtain the coefficients of the @xmath12-th layer of the scattering network as : @xmath13 figures 2 and 3 denote the transformed images of the first and second layers of scattering transform for a sample face image .",
    "these images are derived by applying a filter bank of 5 different scales and 6 orientations .",
    "as we can see , each image of the first layer is more sensitive to a specific orientation and scale . to derive scattering features in our experiment ,",
    "the scattering - transformed images of all layers up to @xmath14 are selected and the mean and variance of these images are calculated and used as scattering features which results in a vector @xmath15 of size @xmath16 .",
    "the scattering features can be extracted either locally or globally .",
    "foreground segmentation schemes can also be used to detect important parts of the face , and extract features only around those regions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "dimensionality reduction algorithms are an essential part of most of today s object recognition algorithms to reduce the feature dimension such that the discriminant power of features are kept .",
    "principal component analysis ( pca ) is a powerful algorithm used for dimensionality reduction @xcite .",
    "given a set of correlated variables , pca transforms them to another domain such that the transformed variables are linearly uncorrelated .",
    "these linearly uncorrelated variables are called principal components .",
    "let us assume @xmath17 denotes the features of the @xmath18-th image in the training set of @xmath19 samples , and we want to find the orthonormal matrix @xmath20 $ ] to project the images as @xmath21 such that the variance of projected @xmath22 s is maximized .",
    "one can show that the optimum @xmath23 can be derived as : @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the covariance of training images and is defined as @xmath27 . then to reduce the dimension of the data to @xmath28",
    ", we can take the first @xmath28 eigenvectors associated with the @xmath28 largest eigenvalues of @xmath26 and project the data on them .",
    "after feature extraction , a classifier needs to be used to predict the label of each test image .",
    "different machine learning algorithms can be used for classification . in this work , support vector machine ( svm ) @xcite",
    "is used to perform template matching .",
    "a brief overview of svm in binary classification problem is provided here .",
    "let us assume we are given a set of training data @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ... ,",
    "@xmath31 and asked to classify them into two classes where @xmath32 is the feature vector and @xmath33 is the class label . for linearly separable classes , two classes can be separated with a hyperplane @xmath34 . among all possible hyperplanes which can separate two classes ,",
    "one reasonable choice is the one with the maximum margin .",
    "the maximum margin hyperplane can be derived by the following optimization problem : @xmath35 + it turns out solving this problem in dual domain is simpler than primal domain and since this problem is convex , the primal and dual solutions are the same .",
    "then after derivation of lagrange multipliers @xmath36 in dual domain , we can derive the following hyperplane for classification : @xmath37 , where @xmath36 and @xmath38 are calculated by the svm learning algorithm .",
    "surprisingly , after solving this optimization problem , most of the @xmath36 s are zero ; therefore only the datapoints @xmath39 with nonzero @xmath36 are important in the final classifier .",
    "these points are called support - vectors .",
    "there is also a soft - margin version of svm which allows for mislabeled examples by introducing a penalty term in the primal optimization problem with a penalty of @xmath40 times the degree of misclassification @xcite .    to derive the nonlinear classifier",
    ", one can map the data from input space into a higher - dimensional feature space @xmath41 as : @xmath42 , so that the classes are linearly separable in the feature space @xcite .",
    "if we assume there exists a kernel function where @xmath43 , then we can use the kernel trick to construct nonlinear svm by replacing the inner product @xmath44 with @xmath45 which results in the following classifier : @xmath46    to derive multi - class svm for a set of data with @xmath47 classes , we can train @xmath47 binary classifiers which can discriminate each class against all other classes , and to choose the class which classifies the test sample with the greatest margin . in another approach , we can train a set of @xmath48 binary classifiers , any of which separates one class from another one and to choose the class that is selected by the most classifiers .",
    "other schemes have also been proposed for multi - class svm . for further detail and extensions to multi - class settings",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we have tested the proposed algorithm on three face databases , yale face database , georgia tech face database and extended yale face database .",
    "we first discuss about the parameter values of our algorithm and then present the results of this algorithm on different databases .      for each image ,",
    "the scattering transform is applied up to two layers using a set of filters with 5 scales and 6 orientations , resulting in 391 transformed images .",
    "the mean and variance of each scatter - transformed images are used as features , which results in scattering features of dimension 782 .",
    "the scattering features are derived using the software implementation provided by mallat s group @xcite .",
    "then pca is applied to all features and the first @xmath49 pca features are used for recognition .",
    "multi - class svm is used for the classification . for svm",
    ", we have used libsvm library @xcite , and linear kernel is used in our implementation .",

    "there are 11 images per subject , one per different facial expression or configuration .",
    "we have performed recognition using multi - class svm . from each class ,",
    "6 images are used as training and the rest as test .",
    "we repeat the experiment for 5 different sets of training images and report the average accuracy here .",

    "the highest accuracy is achieved by using 200 pca features which is around 93.1% .",

    "* extended yale face database : * this database contains the frontal face images of 38 individuals .",
    "we used the cropped images , which were taken under varying illumination conditions and each subject has around 64 images .",
    "we have used half of the images as the training and the rest as test .",
    "figure 6 shows the recognition accuracy using different numbers of pca features . for this case , by using the first 200 pca features , an accuracy rate of around 85% will be achieved .",
    "table 1 provides a comparison of the performance of the proposed scheme and that of 7 previous works on yale face database .",
    "the recognition accuracy for eigenfaces is taken from the reported values in @xcite .",
    "we performed the experiment for 5 different sets of training images and reported the average accuracy below .",
