    "recall that we have made a genericity assumption which guaranteed that the fourier supports were well separated in the angle . in order to relax this condition ,",
    "it is essential to invoke the usual device of _ nullforms _ which cancel out parallel interactions .",
    "one of the discoveries of  @xcite is a genuinely trilinear nullform expansion , see   and  , which exploit the relative position of all three waves simultaneously .",
    "it seems impossible to reduce the trilinear nonlinearities of   exclusively to the easier bilinear ones .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite ( and then also in  @xcite which develops much of the functional framework that we use , as well as  @xcite ) that in low dimensions ( especially @xmath28 but these spaces are also needed for @xmath182 ) , these nullframe spaces are strong enough  in conjunction with more traditional scaling invariant @xmath133 spaces  to bound the trilinear nonlinearities , as well as weak enough to allow for an energy estimate to hold .",

    "we now come to the core of the argument , namely the bahouri - gerard type decomposition and the associated perturbative argument .    in  @xcite p.  grard considered defocusing semilinear wave equations in @xmath186 of the form @xmath187 with data given by a sequence @xmath188 of energy data going weakly to zero .",
    "denote the resulting solutions to the nonlinear problem by  @xmath189 , and the free waves with the same data by  @xmath190 .",
    "grard proved that provided @xmath191 is _ subcritical _ relative to energy then @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the energy space .",
    "in contrast , for this to hold for the energy critical problem he found via the concentrated compactness method of p.  l.  lions that it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath194 .",
    "in other words , the critical problem experiences a _ loss of compactness_.    the origin of this loss of compactness , as well as the meaning of the @xmath195 condition were later made completely explicit by bahouri - gerard  @xcite .",
    "their result reads as follows : _ let @xmath196 be a bounded sequence , and define @xmath190 to be a free wave with these initial data .",
    "then there exists a subsequence @xmath197 of @xmath198 , a finite energy free wave @xmath199 , as well as free waves @xmath200 and @xmath201 for every @xmath202 with the property that for all @xmath203 , @xmath204 where @xmath205 and for any @xmath206 , @xmath207 furthermore , the free energy @xmath208 satisfies the following orthogonality property : @xmath209 _    note that this result characterized the loss of compactness in terms of the appearance of concentration profiles @xmath200 .",
    "moreover , @xcite contains an analogue of this result for so - called shatah - struwe solutions of the semi - linear problem @xmath210 which then leads to another proof of the main result in  @xcite .",
    "one of the main applications of their work was to show the existence of a function @xmath211 so that every shatah - struwe solution satisfies the bound @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the energy associated with the semi - linear equation .",
    "this is proved by contradiction ; indeed , assuming   fails , one then obtains sequences of bounded energy solutions with uncontrollable strichartz norm which is then shown to contradict the fact the nonlinear solutions themselves converge weakly to another solution .",
    "the decomposition   compensates for the aforementioned loss of compactness by reducing it precisely to the effect of the _ symmetries _ , i.e. , dilation and scaling .",
    "this is completely analogous to the elliptic ( in fact , variational ) origins of the method of concentrated compactness , see lions  @xcite and struwe  @xcite .",

    "this method , which will be described in more detail later in this section , represents a general method for attacking global well - posedness problems for energy critical equations such as the wave - map problem .",
    "returning to the bahouri - gerard decomposition , we note that any attempt at implementing this technique for wave maps encounters numerous serious difficulties .",
    "these are of course all rooted in the difficult nonlinear nature of the system  . perhaps the most salient feature of our decomposition as compared to  @xcite is that the free wave equation no longer capture the correct asymptotic behavior for large times ; rather , the atomic components @xmath200 are defined as solutions of a covariant ( or `` twisted '' ) wave equation of the form @xmath214 where the magnetic potential @xmath215 arises from linearizing the wave map equation in the coulomb gauge . more precisely , the magnetic term here captures the high - low - low interactions in the trilinear nonlinearities of the wave map system where there is no apriori smallness gain .    in keeping with the kenig - merle method ,",
    "the bahouri - gerard decomposition is used to show the following : assume that a uniform bound of the form @xmath216 for some function @xmath217 fails for all finite energy levels @xmath218 .",
    "then there must exist a weak wave map @xmath219 to a compact riemann surface uniformized by @xmath220 , which enjoys certain compactness properties . in the final part of the argument",
    "we then need to rule out the existence of such an object .",
    "arguing by contradiction , we now assume there is a sequence of schwartz class ( on fixed time slices ) wave maps @xmath221 with the properties that    * @xmath222 * @xmath223    thus all these wave maps have @xmath109 in their domain of definition . roughly speaking",
    ", we shall proceed along the following steps .",
    "first , recall that the bahouri - gerard theorem is a genuine phase - space result in the sense that it identifies the main asymptotic carriers of energy _ which are not pure radiation _ , which would then sit in @xmath224 .",
    "this refers to the free waves @xmath200 above , which are `` localized '' in frequency ( namely at scale @xmath225 ) as well as in physical spaces ( namely around the space - time points @xmath226 ) .",
    "the procedure of filtering out the scales @xmath227 is due to metivier - schochet , see  @xcite .    1 .   _ bahouri - gerard i : filtering out frequency blocks . _ + if we apply the frequency localization procedure of metivier - schochet to the derivative components @xmath228 at time @xmath109 , we run into the problem that the resulting frequency components are not necessarily related to an actual map from @xmath229 .",
    "we introduce a procedure to obtain a frequency decomposition which is `` geometric '' , i.e. , the frequency localized pieces are themselves derivative components of maps from @xmath230 .",
    "refining the considerations on frequency localization ; frequency localized approximative maps_. in order to deal with the non - atomic ( in the frequency sense ) derivative components , which may still have large energy , we need to be able to truncate the derivative components arbitrarily in frequency while still retaining the geometric interpretation .",
    "here we shall use arguments just as in the first step to allow us to `` build up '' the components @xmath231 from low frequency ones . in the end",
    ", we of course need to show that for some subsequence of the @xmath231 , the frequency support is essentially atomic .",
    "if this were to fail , we deduce an apriori bound on @xmath232 .",
    "3 .   _ assuming the presence of a lowest energy non - atomic type component , establish an apriori estimate for its nonlinear evolution . _",
    "this requires deriving energy estimates for the covariant wave equation  .",
    "bahouri - gerard ii , applied to the first atomic frequency component_. here , assuming that we have constructed the first `` low frequency approximation '' in the previous step , we need to filter out the physically localized pieces .",
    "this is where we have to deviate from kenig - merle : instead of the free wave operator , we need to use a covariant wave operator to model the asymptotics as @xmath233 . again",
    "a lot of effort needs to be expended on showing that the components we obtain are actually the coulomb derivative components of schwartz maps from @xmath230 , up to arbitrarily small errors in energy .",
    "once we have this , we can then use the result from the stability section in order to construct the time evolution of these pieces and obtain their apriori dispersive behavior .",
    "_ bahouri - gerard ii ; completion_. here we repeat steps  3 and 4 for the ensuing frequency pieces , to complete the estimate for the @xmath231 .",
    "the conclusion is that upon choosing @xmath234 large enough , we arrive at a contradiction , unless there is precisely one frequency component and precisely one atomic physical component forming that frequency component .",
    "these are the data that then gives rise to the weak wave map with the desired compactness properties .",
    "in @xcite , @xcite , kenig and merle developed an approach to the global wellposendess for defocusing energy critical semilinear schrdinger and wave equations ; moreover , their argument yields a blowup / global existence dichotomy in the focusing case as well , provided the energy of the wave lies beneath a certain threshold .",
    "see  @xcite for an application of these ideas to wave maps .",
    "let us give a brief overview of their argument .",
    "consider @xmath235 in @xmath236 with data in @xmath237 .",
    "it is standard that this equation is well - posed for small data provided we place the solution in the energy space intersected with suitable strichartz spaces .",
    "moreover , if @xmath100 is the maximal interval of existence , then necessarily @xmath238 and the energy @xmath213 is conserved .",
    "now suppose @xmath239 is the minimal energy with the property that all solutions in the above sense with @xmath240 exist globally and satisfy @xmath241 .",
    "then by means of the bahouri - gerard decomposition , as well as the perturbation theory for this equation one concludes that a critical solution @xmath242 exists on some interval  @xmath243 and that @xmath244 .",
    "moreover , by similar arguments one obtains the crucial property that the set @xmath245 is precompact in @xmath246 for a suitable path @xmath247 . to see this , one applies the bahouri - gerard decomposition to a sequence @xmath189 of solutions with energy @xmath248 from above .",
    "the logic here is that due to the minimality assumption on  @xmath239 _ only a single limiting profile can arise in _   up to errors that go to zero in energy as @xmath249 .",
    "indeed , if this were not the case then due to fact that the profiles diverge from each other in physical space as @xmath249 one can then apply the perturbation theory to conclude that each of the individual nonlinear evolutions of the limiting profiles ( which exist due to the fact that their energies are strictly below  @xmath239 ) can be superimposed to form a global nonlinear evolution , contradicting the choice of the sequence @xmath189 .",
    "the fact that @xmath250 allows one to rescale and re - translate the unique limiting profile to a fixed position in phase space ( meaning spatial position and spatial frequency ) which then gives the desired nonlinear evolution  @xmath242 .",
    "the compactness follows by the same logic : assuming that it does not hold , one then obtains a sequence @xmath251 evaluated at times @xmath252 converging to an endpoint of  @xmath243 such that for @xmath253 , the rescaled and translated versions of  @xmath251 and  @xmath254 remain at a minimal positive distance from each other in the energy norm .",
    "again one applies bahouri - gerard and finds that @xmath250 by the choice of  @xmath239 and perturbation theory .",
    "this gives the desired contradiction .",
    "the compactness property is of course crucial ; indeed , for illustrative purposes suppose that @xmath242 is of the form @xmath255 where @xmath256 as @xmath257 , say .",
    "then @xmath242 blows up at time  @xmath258 ( in the sense that the energy concentrates at the tip of a cone ) and @xmath259 is compact for @xmath260 .",
    "returning to the kenig - merle argument , the logic is now to show that @xmath242 acts in some sense like a blow - up solution , at least if @xmath243 is finite in one direction .",
    "the second half of the kenig - merle approach then consists of a rigidity argument which shows that a @xmath242 with the stated properties can not exist .",
    "this is done mainly by means of the conservation laws , such as the morawetz and energy identities .",
    "more precisely , the case where @xmath243 is finite at one end is reduced to the self - similar blowup scenario .",
    "this , however , is excluded by reducing to the stationary case and an elliptic analysis which proves that the solution would have to vanish .",
    "if @xmath243 is infinite , one basically faces the possibility of stationary solutions which are again shown not to exist .    for the case of wave maps , we follow the same strategy . more precisely , our adaptation of the bahouri - gerard decomposition to wave maps into  @xmath38 leads to a critical wave map with the desired compactness properties .",
    "in the course of our proof , it will be convenient to project the wave map onto a compact riemann surface  @xmath261 ( so that we can avail ourselves of the _ extrinsic formulation _ of the wave map equation ) .",
    "however , it will be important to work simultaneously with this object as well as the lifted one which takes its values in  @xmath38 ( since it is for the latter that we have a meaningful wellposedness theory for maps with energy data ) .",
    "the difference from  @xcite lies mainly with the rigidity part .",
    "in fact , in our context the conservation laws are by themselves not sufficient to yield a contradiction .",
    "this is natural , since the geometry of the target will need to play a crucial role . as indicated above , the two scenarios that are lead to a contradiction are the self - similar blowup supported inside of a light - cone and the stationary weak wave map , which is of course a weakly harmonic map ( which can not exist since the target @xmath261 is compact with negative curvature ) .",
    "the former is handled as follows : in self - similar coordinates , one obtains a harmonic map defined on the disk with the hyperbolic metric and with finite energy ( the stationarity is derived as in  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is the added twist that one controls the behavior of this map at the boundary in the trace sense ( in fact , one shows that this trace is constant ) .",
    "therefore , one can apply the boundary regularity version of helein s theorem which was obtained by qing  @xcite .",
    "theorem  @xcite then yields the constancy of the harmonic map , whence the contradiction ( for a version of this argument under the apriori assumption of regularity all the way to the boundary see shatah - struwe  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is essentially divided into two parts : the * modified bahouri - gerard method * is carried out in its entirety starting with section  [ sec : spaces ] , and ending with section  [ sec : bg ] .",
    "indeed , all that precedes section  [ sec : bg ] leads to this section , which is the core of this paper .",
    "the * kenig - merle method adapted to wave maps * is then performed in the much shorter section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we commence by describing in detail the contents of section  [ sec : spaces ] to section  [ sec : bg ] .",
    "as explained above , we describe admissible wave maps @xmath262 mostly in terms of the associated coulomb derivative components @xmath77 .",
    "our goals then are to    * _ ( 1 ) : develop a suitable functional framework _",
    ", in particular a space - time norm @xmath263 , together with time - localized versions @xmath264 for closed time intervals @xmath100 , which have the property that @xmath265 for some open interval @xmath266 implies that the underlying wave map @xmath267 can be extended smoothly and admissibly beyond any endpoint of @xmath266 , provided such exists . * _ ( 2 ) : establish an a priori bound _ of the form @xmath268 for some function @xmath269 of the energy @xmath218 .",
    "this latter step will be accomplished by the bahouri gerard procedure , arguing by contradiction .",
    "we first describe ( 1 ) above in more detail : in section  [ sec : spaces ] , we introduce the norms @xmath130}$ ] , @xmath270}$ ] , @xmath271 , which are used to control the frequency localized components of @xmath129 and the nonlinear source terms , respectively . the norm @xmath272 is then obtained by square summation over all frequency blocks .",
    "the basic paradigm for establishing estimates on @xmath129 then is to formulate a wave equation @xmath273 or more accurately typically in frequency localized form @xmath274 and to establish bounds for @xmath275}$ ] which may then be fed into an energy inequality , see section  [ subsec : energy ] , which establishes the link between the @xmath78 and @xmath276-spaces . in order to be able to estimate the nonlinear source terms @xmath277",
    ", we need to manipulate the right - hand side of , making extensive use of .",
    "the precise description of the actual nonlinear source terms that we will use for @xmath277 is actually rather involved , and given in section  [ sec : hodge ] . in order to estimate the collection of trilinear as well as higher order terms",
    ", we carefully develop the necessary estimates in sections  [ sec : bilin ] , [ sec : trilin ] , as well as [ sec : quintic ] .",
    "we note that the estimates in @xcite , while similar , are not quite strong enough for our purposes , since we need to gain in the largest frequency in case of high - high cascades .",
    "this requires us to subtly modify the spaces by comparison to loc .",
    "moreover , the fact that we manage here to build in sharp strichartz estimates allows us to replace several arguments in @xcite by more natural ones , and we opted to make our present account as self - contained as possible .    with the null - form estimates from sections  [ sec :",
    "bilin ] , [ sec : trilin ] ,  [ sec : quintic ] in hand , we establish the role of @xmath1 as a `` regularity controlling '' device in the sense of  ( 1 ) above in section  [ sec : perturb ] , see proposition  [ blowupcriterion ] .",
    "the proof of this reveals a somewhat unfortunate feature of our present setup , namely the fact that working at the level of the differentiated wave map system produces sometimes too many time derivatives , which forces us to use somewhat delicate `` randomization '' of times arguments . in particular , in the proof of all apriori estimates ,",
    "we need to distinguish between a `` small time '' case ( typically called case  1 ) and a `` long time '' case  2 , by reference to a fixed frequency scale . in the short time case , one works exclusively in terms of the div - curl system , while in the long - time case , the wave equations start to be essential .",
    "section  [ sec : perturb ] furthermore explains the well - posedness theory at the level of the @xmath77 , see the most crucial proposition  [ prop : ener_stable ] .",
    "we do not prove this proposition in section  [ sec : perturb ] , as it follows as a byproduct of the core perturbative proposition  [ psibootstrap ] in section  [ sec : bg ] .",
    "proposition  [ prop : ener_stable ] and the technically difficult but fundamental lemma  [ basicstability ] allow us to define the `` coulomb wave maps propagation '' for a tuple @xmath77 , @xmath278 which are only @xmath150 functions at time @xmath109 , provided the latter are the @xmath150-limits of the coulomb components of admissible maps .",
    "indeed , this concept of propagation is independent of the approximating sequence chosen and satisfies the necessary continuity properties .",
    "we also formulate the concept of a `` wave map at infinity '' at the level of the coulomb components , see proposition  [ prop : waveops ] and the following corollary  [ temporallyunbounded ] . again",
    "the proofs of these results will follow as a byproduct of the fundamental proposition  [ psibootstrap ] and proposition  [ bgiihard ] in the core section  [ sec : bg ] .    in section  [ sec : bmo ]",
    ", we develop some auxiliary technical tools from harmonic analysis which will allow us to implement the first stage of the bahouri gerard process , namely crystallizing frequency atoms from an `` essentially singular '' sequence of admissible wave maps .",
    "these tools are derived from the imbedding @xmath279 as well as weighted ( relative to @xmath280 ) coifman - meyer commutator bounds .    as mentioned before , section  [ sec : bg ] is the core of the present paper . in section  [ subsec : bgstep1 ] , starting with an _ essentially singular _",
    "sequence @xmath281 of admissible wave maps with deteriorating bounds , i.e. , @xmath282 as @xmath249 but with the crucial criticality condition @xmath283 , we show that the derivative components @xmath284 may be decomposed as a sum @xmath285 where the @xmath286 are derivative components of admissible wave maps which have frequency supports `` drifting apart '' as @xmath249 , while the error @xmath287 satisfies @xmath288 provided @xmath289 is large enough .    in section  [ subsec : bgstep2 ] , we then select a number of `` principal '' frequency atoms @xmath290 , @xmath291 , as well as a ( potentially very large ) collection of `` small atoms '' @xmath290 , @xmath292 .",
    "we order these atoms by the frequency scale around which they are supported starting with those of the lowest frequency .",
    "the idea now is as follows : under the assumption that there are at least two frequency atoms , or else in case of only one frequency atom that it has energy @xmath293 , we want to obtain a contradiction to the essential criticality of the underlying sequence @xmath281 . to achieve this ,",
    "we define in section  [ subsec : bgstep2 ] sequence of approximating wave maps , which are essentially obtained by carefully truncating the initial data sequence @xmath290 in frequency space .    in section  [ subsec : bgstep3 ]",
    ", we establish an apriori bound for the lowest frequency approximating map which comprises all the minimum frequency small atoms as well as the component of the small besov error of smallest frequency , see proposition  [ controlnonatomiccomponent1 ] .",
    "the proof of this follows again by truncating the data suitably in frequency space , and applying an inductive procedure to a sequence of approximating wave maps .",
    "this hinges crucially on the core perturbative result proposition  [ psibootstrap ] , which plays a fundamental role in the paper .",
    "the main technical difficulty encountered in the proof of the latter comes from the issue of * fungiblity * : given a schematically written expression @xmath294\\ ] ] which is _ linear _ in the perturbation ( so that we can not perform a bootstrap argument based solely on the smallness on @xmath295 itself ) , while @xmath296 denotes some null - form depending on apriori controlled components @xmath129 .",
    "fungibility means the property that upon suitably truncating time into finitely many intervals @xmath297 _ whose number only depends on @xmath298 _ , one may bound the expression by @xmath299\\|_{n(i_j\\times\\r^2)}\\ll \\|\\epsilon\\|_{s}\\ ] ] in other words , by shrinking the time interval , we ensure that we can iterate the term away .",
    "while this would be straightforward provided we had an estimate for @xmath300 ( which is possible in space dimensions @xmath301 ) , in our setting , the spaces are much too weak and complicated .",
    "our way out of this impasse is to build those terms for which we have no obvious fungibility into the linear operator , and thereby form a new operator @xmath302 with a magnetic potential term .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that if @xmath303 is supported at much lower frequencies than @xmath295 ( which is precisely the case where fungibility fails ) , one can establish an approximate energy conservation result , which in particular gives apriori control over a certain constituent of @xmath304 . with this in hand",
    ", one can complete the bootstrap argument , and obtain full control over @xmath305 .",
    "having established control over the lowest - frequency `` essentially non - atomic '' approximating wave map in section  [ subsec : bgstep3 ] , we face the task of `` adding the first large atomic component '' , @xmath306 .",
    "it is here that we have to depart crucially from the original method of bahouri - gerard : instead of studying the free wave evolution of the data , we extract concentration cores by applying the `` twisted '' covariant evolution associated with @xmath307 which is essentially defined as above .",
    "the key property that makes everything work is an almost exact energy conservation property associated with its wave flow .",
    "this is a rather delicate point : it relies on the mixed - lebesgue type endpoint bilinear improved strichartz bound of wolff  @xcite , tao  @xcite , @xcite , and tataru  @xcite .",
    "it then requires a fair amount of work to show that the profile decomposition at time @xmath109 in terms of covariant free waves is `` geometric '' , in the sense that the concentration profiles can indeed by approximated by the coulomb components of admissible maps , up to a constant phase shift , see proposition  [ concentrarionprofileapprox ] .",
    "+ finally , in proposition  [ bgiihard ] we show that we may evolve the data including the first large frequency atom , provided all concentration cores have energy strictly less than @xmath239 .",
    "as most of the work has been done at this point , adding on the remaining frequency atoms in section  [ subsec : bgend ] does not provide any new difficulties , and can be done by the methods of the preceding sections .    in conjunction with the results of section  [ sec : perturb ]",
    ", we can then infer that given an essentially singular sequence of wave maps @xmath281 , we may select a subsequence of them whose coulomb components @xmath308 , up to re - scalings and translations , converge to a limiting object @xmath309 , which is well - defined on some interval @xmath310 where @xmath100 is either a finite time interval or ( semi)-infinite , and the limit of the coulomb components of admissible maps there .",
    "moreover , most crucially for the sequel , @xmath309 satisfies a remarkable _ compactness property _ , see proposition  [ cor : compactv ] .",
    "this sets the stage for the method of kenig - merle , which we adopt to the context of wave maps .",
