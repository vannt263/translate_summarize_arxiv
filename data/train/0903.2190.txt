    "the triplet superconducting proximity effect@xcite in half - metals ( fully polarized ferromagnets , conducting only for one spin direction ) has received a considerable attention recently , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite the mechanism behind the effect is the process of triplet andreev reflection at the half - metal ",
    "superconductor interface.@xcite the key ingredient that allows and influences this reflection process is provided by the magnetic properties of the interface between the half - metal and the superconductor : it should have a magnetization that is misaligned from that of the half - metal.@xcite the role of such an interface is to break all the symmetries in spin - space , thereby allowing for the spin rotations necessary for the triplet andreev reflection .",
    "the properties of the interface , however , are not easy to manipulate in experiments , which is the reason why only a low proportion of half - metal ",
    "superconductor samples show behavior consistent with triplet andreev reflection.@xcite here we study triplet andreev reflection in a setup that is free of this difficulty .",
    "the setup consists of an andreev quantum dot@xcite ( i.e. , a quantum dot in contact with a superconductor ) , coupled to a normal , source reservoir via a single - mode quantum point contact ( qpc ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "spin - orbit scattering in the quantum dot is assumed to be strong enough that the direction of the spin is randomized in much shorter time than the typical time @xmath0 of the escape from the dot .",
    "this allows the dot to effectively play the role of the interface .",
    "the role of the half metal is played by the qpc , which is set to the spin - selective @xmath1 conductance plateau using a parallel magnetic field.@xcite ( for simplicity , we assume that the andreev conductance of the contact to the superconductor is much larger than @xmath1 , which makes the transport properties insensitive to the details of this contact . )    a surprising feature of triplet andreev reflection is that despite the randomized spin in the quantum dot , the conductance of such a fully phase coherent , single - channel system vanishes in the zero temperature , linear response regime.@xcite while current can be passed through the system using finite voltages or temperature , it is natural to ask , whether there is still a possibility for transport in the zero temperature , linear response limit . in this paper",
    "we show that there is : relaxing the condition of full phase coherence enables the zero - bias triplet andreev conductance to take nonzero values . in the remaining sections ,",
    "our goal is to demonstrate this statement by studying the behavior of the triplet andreev conductance in the presence of dephasing in detail .",
    ", via a single - mode , spin - filtering qpc .",
    "dephasing is introduced by coupling the dot to a voltage probe ( vp ) via a contact supporting @xmath2 modes with a tunnel barrier ( black rectangle ) of transparency @xmath3 per mode.,height=170 ]",
    "we introduce dephasing by coupling the quantum dot to an additional normal reservoir , which acts as a voltage probe.@xcite a voltage probe draws no net current , but it absorbs and reinjects quasiparticles without a phase relationship , thereby destroying phase coherence . dephasing due to a voltage probe in normal - superconducting structures at zero temperature was studied in refs .  , for systems where no triplet andreev reflection could occur .",
    "the contact to the voltage probe is characterized by the number of modes ( including the spin degrees of freedom ) @xmath2 and the tunnel probability per mode @xmath3 , which together determine the dephasing rate as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the mean level spacing of the quantum dot .",
    "we consider two limits , a voltage probe with a single mode , spin - filtering contact , @xmath6 , and a voltage probe with macroscopic number of modes , @xmath7 .",
    "in the first case the dephasing rate is controlled by the tunnel probability . in the second case , for @xmath8 , which will turn out to be the regime where the conductance behaves nontrivially , the transport properties depend on @xmath2 and @xmath3 only through their product , i.e. ,",
    "the dephasing rate.@xcite the two limits considered here represent two types of voltage probes that appear in the context of spin dependent quantum transport.@xcite the probe @xmath6 is a spin - conserving probe , while without further specification , the @xmath7 can be either a spin - conserving or a spin - nonconserving voltage probe .",
    "for the systems studied in this paper , there is no need for further specification , as the type of the voltage probe is unimportant due to the strong spin - orbit scattering in the quantum dot .",
    "we formulate our problem within the framework of the scattering matrix approach .",
    "the transport quantities of interest are expressed in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath9 at the fermi energy ( the chemical potential of the superconductor ) , relating incoming and outgoing modes ( including the electron - hole degrees of freedom ) in the contacts to the normal reservoirs .",

    "the calculational advantage of this case is that it allows for a problem with minimal dimension , with the single mode source contact and a single mode voltage probe contact resulting in a @xmath21 scattering matrix .",
    "the parallel magnetic field together with the strong spin - orbit scattering places the quantum dot in the unitary symmetry class.@xcite consequently , the dot - superconductor system belongs to class @xmath22 in the symmetry classification of altland and zirnbauer,@xcite which translates to @xmath23 as the only constraint for the scattering matrix , besides unitarity .",

    ", we did not intend to use the voltage probe to model dephasing processes intrinsic to the quantum dot , since accounting for the temperature dependence of such processes would necessitate considering the effect of thermal smearing.@xcite instead , our results apply to the situation where the dephasing rate is controlled by a real , physically present voltage probe .",
