    "future large interferometers @xcite need a large number of telescopes and an active cophasing system , to provide images with sufficient sensitivity .",
    "if both conditions are met , snapshot imaging can be used in the hypertelescope mode @xcite and a multi - axial beam combiner seems to be the best solution . if the entrance pupil is highly diluted , the hypertelescope mode improves the fizeau mode , with a high sensitivity gain without any loss of the useful field of view for direct imaging applications .",
    "this useful field , where a direct image can be correctly recovered , is called the clean field @xcite .",
    "direct imaging has two main features . in a conventional sense ,",
    "the goal is to provide snapshot images that could then be post - processed by deconvolution techniques .",
    "these images give valuable regularization constraints for the a posteriori astrophysical analysis process .",
    "furthermore , direct imaging is well suitable to feed the entrance plane of focal instruments such as coronagraphic devices or integral field spectrometer . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate our analysis on the raw images without considering the deconvolution techniques or the coupling with a focal instrument .    keeping in mind the researches on the ways to optimize the imaging capabilities of a hypertelescope",
    ", this paper aims at characterizing the point spread functions of typical future large arrays . for this purpose ,",
    "we have developed a numerical simulation , called hypertel , which first simulates direct images ( sect .",
    "[ hypertel ] ) and then analyses the densified psf properties by defining different quantitative criteria ( sect .",
    "[ psf ] ) .",
    "then , we study the impact of the array configuration ( geometry of the array and number of apertures ) and of the recombination mode ( sect .",
    "[ psf_ppty ] ) .",
    "finally , we establish the relations between the astrophysical parameters of the science object and the main parameters of the hypertelescope ( sect .",
    "[ psf biases ] ) .",
    "the input parameters are the wavelength , the characteristics of the science object , the array configuration and the recombination mode . + we assume a perfectly cophased array , without any degradation in the image due to atmospheric turbulence or instrumental bias . to simplify the study , we restrict ourselves to the monochromatic case .",
    "the array is made of @xmath8 identical sub - apertures of index @xmath9 , defined by their positions @xmath10 in the input pupil plane and by their diameter @xmath11 .",
    "we note @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) the smallest ( resp .",
    "largest ) baseline of the array .",
    "the maximum angular resolution of the array , following the rayleigh criterion , is given by the highest baseline :    @xmath12      the object is defined by a monochromatic brightness map , @xmath13 pixels wide .",
    "the angular extent of this map is equal to the object diameter @xmath14 .",
    "the angular size of a pixel @xmath15 , i.e. the smallest angular element seen on the sky , should respect the shannon criterion :    @xmath16    in practice , we choose @xmath17 .",
    "thus , @xmath18 .",
    "the object is considered as composed of elementary incoherent sources , corresponding to the @xmath19 pixels of the brightness map .",
    "each elementary source of index @xmath20 is defined by its coordinates @xmath21 and by its intensity @xmath22 .    for each elementary source ,",
    "the off - axis position is defined on the two axis by :    @xmath23    the image is obtained as the sum of the sub - images of each incoherent elementary source . as the input sub - pupils are very diluted , we neglect the variation of the object in the spatial frequency domains [ @xmath24;@xmath25 accessible in certain recombination schemes .",
    "pupil densification increases by a factor @xmath26 the relative size of the beams and keeps the relative positions of the sub - pupil centres ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dif_cf_clf ] ) .",
    "this pseudo - homothetic transformation does not affect the interferometric pattern in the image and correctly recovers the high resolution information .",
    "the diffraction envelope is reduced , so as to concentrate all the flux in the useful field .",
    "the alternative concept of iran @xcite combines the beams by superimposing the images of the sub - pupils with small tilts in the image plane .",
    "a direct image is obtained in the recombined pupil plane .",
    "the envelope shape is a bessel function in pupil densification ( dp mode ) and is a flat field in iran mode .",
    "the envelope width decreases as the densification factor increases .",
    "the value of the latter is chosen between 1 ( fizeau mode ) and @xmath2 ( maximum densification ) .",
    "the maximum densification factor depends on the smallest baseline @xmath0 and on the aperture diameter @xmath11 : @xmath27    the pupil densification amplifies the intensity of the signal by a factor @xmath7 . in the iran mode",
    ", the densification factor can not be larger than @xmath28 due to the diffraction of the sub - pupils @xcite .",
    "thus the sensitivity gain is reduced by a factor 4 and the dif is enlarged by a factor 2 , compared to the dp mode .",
    "we mainly focus in this paper on the pupil densification ( dp ) for the recombination mode .",
    "we also make comparison with the image densification ( iran ) .",
    "the principle of the image calculation is schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig : prog_bloc_diag ] . in the image plane , each pixel of coordinates @xmath29 has an intensity of @xmath30 .",
    "+ the point spread function @xcite is defined as the product of the interference function @xmath31 ( function of the array pattern ) with the diffraction envelope @xmath32 ( function of the recombination mode and of the densification factor ) .",
    "@xmath33    with :    @xmath34    the direct image of an astrophysical object is defined as the object brightness distribution @xmath35 convolved by the interference function , the result being multiplied by the diffraction envelope .",
    "@xmath36    finally , the image computed by hypertel is the sum of the sub - images of each incoherent elementary source of the object ( as defined in sect .",
    "[ hypertel_object ] ) .",
    "@xmath37    we denote @xmath38 the phase delay seen by the @xmath39 sub - aperture due to the position of the elementary source @xmath20 .",
    "indeed each elementary source is seen under a different angle by each sub - aperture of the interferometer .",
    "hence , @xmath38 is given by :    @xmath40",
    "as the computed images are a function of the characteristics of the entrance pupil , we first define two parameters related to the interferometer configuration . the entrance ( resp .",
    "densified ) pupil filling rate @xmath41 ( resp.@xmath42 ) is defined as the ratio between the total surface area of the input ( resp . output ) pupil and the surface area of an input ( resp .",
    "output ) sub - pupil , @xmath11 ( resp @xmath43 ) being the diameter of the latter :    @xmath44    @xmath45      the definitions of the different fields of view for a hypertelescope have been extensively studied by @xcite .",
    "we just recall here the important definitions of these different fields .",
    "we distinguish the clean field of view ( clf ) , the direct imaging field of view ( dif ) and the coupled field of view ( cf ) .",
    "they are illustrated on figure [ fig : dif_cf_clf ] .",
    "@xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    the clean field is physically related to the sampling of the ( u , v ) plane and according to nyquist - shannon sampling theorem , it is defined by the smallest baseline @xmath0 . this definition is also interesting on calculating the number of resels in the clean field .",
    "the coupled field ( cf ) is imposed by the size of a sub - aperture .",
    "the direct imaging field ( dif ) depends on the densification mode .",
    "the dif width is still obviously smaller than the cf width .    ) , on - axis intensity ( @xmath49 ) , encircled energy ( @xmath50 ) , full - width at half - maximum ( @xmath51 ) of the central peak , maximum halo level ( @xmath52).,width=207 ]      in the direct image , the position of each interference peak ( central peak and side - lobes ) is given by the coordinates of its photocentre ( fig .",
    "[ fig : critere_psf ] ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the central peak corresponds to the smallest resolution element ( resel ) , given by equation [ eq_resel ] .",
    "it characterizes the sharpness of the image .",
    "it depends not only on the wavelength and on the maximum baseline , but also on the geometry of the array .",
    "the on - axis intensity @xmath49 is equal to the height of the central peak .",
    "the encircled energy is defined as the ratio of the fraction of energy contained in the central peak @xmath53 to the total energy in the image @xmath54 :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 corresponds to the first minimum from the center of the field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : critere_psf ] ) .",
    "we also define a criterion to estimate the contribution of the halo surrounding the central peak .",
    "the maximum of the halo level is defined as the ratio between @xmath57 the intensity of the highest side - lobe inside the clf and @xmath49 the intensity of the central peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : critere_psf ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "simulations have shown that the choice of the array configuration ( array pattern and number of apertures ) is a trade - off between the resolution , the halo level and the useful field .",
    "the spatial resolution is given by the largest baseline ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the clean field is a function of the smallest baseline ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the halo level and the encircled energy in the central peak are a function of the densified pupil filling rate @xmath42 .",
    "the sine qua none condition to image a complex source without space aliasing effect is that the object diameter should not exceed the clean field width ( @xmath60 ) .    concerning the beam combiner ,",
    "it has been shown that the maximum densification is optimal in term of sensitivity , by equalizing the direct imaging field ( dif ) with the clean field .",
    "simulations have shown that the configurations keops and carlina are equivalent as regards the image characteristics .",
    "however , keops is less sensitive to the space aliasing effect , contrary to carlina where ghost stars are introduced by the pollution of the surrounding sources .",
    "thus , a non redundant array is required for direct imaging to minimize the space aliasing effect .",
    "finally , the best configuration seems to be the one proposed by keops , which has a regular and non redundant layout of the telescopes .",
    "this configuration provides the best quality of the interference function , in comparison with the interference function of the equivalent giant telescope .",
    "indeed , it provides the lowest halo level ( inside the clean field ) , at the limit of the diffraction of such kind of array .",
    "moreover , minimizing the halo level improves the signal to noise ratio , which should simplify the deconvolution process .",
    "thus , a keops configuration seems to be suited for high - contrast imaging of compact sources .",
    "an ovla configuration can be used for wide field imaging , providing a larger clean field and the best resolving power .",
    "this paper was mainly focused on future large arrays with a large number of sub - apertures .",
    "however , the direct imaging technique already has a great interest for current operating interferometers , using an efficient cophasing system .",
    "indeed , the densification may provide the ultimate sensitivity",
    ".    it will be also interesting in the future to compare the performances of direct imaging and aperture synthesis .",
    "the introduction of the fundamental and instrumental noises is also mandatory for a correct evaluation of the scientific performances .",
    "finally this work will be developed in two main directions : the study of the instrumental performances of direct imaging arrays when coupled with integral field spectrometers or coronagraphs , and the comparison of the practical imaging performances of various array configurations when deconvolution is applied .",
