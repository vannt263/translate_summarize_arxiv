    "binary supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) resulting from galaxy mergers should be commonplace , given that virtually every massive galaxy harbors a smbh @xcite .",
    "however , cases are rare where both smbhs in a merging system are accreting as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "hundreds of binary agns with @xmath810  kpc separations have been discovered both at high redshifts @xcite and locally @xcite .",
    "but , there are only a few _ confirmed _ kpc - scale binary agns @xcite .",
    "such close binaries are important , because strong tidal interactions are more likely to influence the nuclear accretion and star formation in both galaxies at kpc - scale separations @xcite .",
    "systematic searches for kpc - scale binary agns have focused on agns with pairs of narrow [ oiii]@xmath35007  emission lines in spatially integrated spectra @xcite , which account for @xmath91% of the agns in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "sdss data are inadequate to confirm such binaries because they are typically spatially unresolved in seeing - limited optical data .",
    "however , subsequent high - resolution imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy have found that most of these agns show double - peaked line profiles because of gas kinematics driven by outflows , inflows , or disk rotation @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , these observations have also found a few binary agn candidates that show seyfert - like emission - line regions that spatially coincide with the stellar nuclei of the merging galaxies @xcite . yet , none of these candidates has been confirmed to host two actively accreting smbhs , because with the optical data alone , it is difficult to rule out that a seyfert-2-type emission - line region is photoionized by an agn _ outside _ of that region .",
    "high - resolution radio or x - ray detections of both nuclei can provide unambiguous evidence for active accretion ( see the vlba searches of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "sdssj150243.1@xmath0111557  ( @xmath1 , @xmath10 ; hereafter sdssj1502 + 1115 ) is a double - peaked type-1 agn identified by @xcite .",

    "for the 1.4  ghz data , we used `` uniform '' weighting to achieve the best resolution .",

    "both sources are compact .",
    "the beam - deconvolved sizes of both components are less than 0.3  ( 1.6  kpc ) at both 5.0 and 8.5  ghz ; the size measurements from the 1.4  ghz image are less accurate .",

    "the @xmath20-band image resolved sdssj1502 + 1115  into two components separated by 1.39  ( 7.4  kpc ) , and the integral - field spectroscopy spatially resolved the kinematic components and associated them with the two stellar nuclei @xcite .",

    "[ fig : snifs ] , we show the optical spectra of the two components extracted from the snifs datacube with 0.8  apertures .",

    "we compare the evla images with the sdss @xmath21-band and the @xmath20-band images in figure  [ fig : allimage ] .",

    "if the radio emission is entirely driven by star formation , the rest - frame 1.4  ghz power of @xmath27 and @xmath28 w  hz@xmath15 imply star formation rates ( sfrs ) of 273 and 787 @xmath5  yr@xmath15 for the primary and secondary , respectively @xcite",
    ". however , these tremendous amounts of star formation disagree with other well - established star formation indicators , such as the the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity and the [ oii]@xmath33727  luminosity , especially for the type-2 secondary , indicating that star formation is unlikely to dominate the radio emission .",
    "first , sdssj1502 + 1115  is undetected by _ iras _  in all four bands ( 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath17 m ) .",
    "the @xmath29 60@xmath17 m  3-@xmath22 upper limit of 0.15  jy sets an upper limit of @xmath30 w  hz@xmath15 to the 1.4  ghz power from star formation , adopting the fir - radio correlation of @xcite .",
    "this total upper limit is 2.0 and 5.9 times _ less _ than observed for the primary and secondary alone .",
    "secondly , the [ oii ]  luminosities give sfrs much less than those from the radio luminosity , even if we make the unrealistic assumption that all of the [ oii ]  emission comes from star formation .",
    "we use the narrow h@xmath23/h@xmath31  ratio to estimate the intrinsic extinction , given an intrinsic ratio of 3.1 @xcite .",
    "we find extinctions of @xmath32 0.78 and @xmath33 .",
