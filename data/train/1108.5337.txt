    "excitons delocalized in closely spaced quantum dots ( qds ) recombine in a different way than in a single qd @xcite .",
    "this effect is at least partly due to collective interaction of the two emitters with the quantum radiation field @xcite . for non - interacting dots this collective effect appears only if the interband transition energies in the two qds differ by no more than the emission line width , which requires the dots to be nearly identical , beyond the current technological possibilities .",
    "however , coupling between the dots restores the collective nature of the emission and leads to accelerated or slowed down emission even for dots with different transitions energies , which is manifested in the optical response from these systems @xcite .",
    "the two major couplings that may appear in a system of qds are due to coulomb interactions and carrier tunneling .",
    "the former results from the coupling between the interband dipole moments associated with the excitons in the dots ( sometimes referred to as the _ dispersion force _ ) @xcite .",
    "it has a long - range nature , with the typical @xmath0 behavior at short distances ( actually , this singularity is removed for charges distributed in a finite volume @xcite ) and an oscillating tail with an envelope decaying as @xmath1 at distances larger than the resonant wave length .",
    "the tunnel coupling is a short - range interaction , which vanishes exponentially at distances on the order of a few nanometers .    in this contribution",
    ", we study the spontaneous emission from an exciton confined in a double quantum dot , focusing on the similarities and differences between the cases of radiative ( long - range , dipole ) and tunnel coupling between the excitons in the dots .",
    "we show that for strictly identical dots the oscillating nature of the dipole coupling on long distances leads to non - monotonic dependence of the radiative decay rate on the inter - dot separation .",
    "however , for a double dot system with a realistic , technologically feasible mismatch of transition energies , the collective effects disappear completely well before these oscillations become relevant . in both cases ,",
    "there is no qualitative difference between the emission induced by the long - range dipole interaction and that due to short - range tunnel couplings with appropriately chosen ( but realistic ) parameters , in spite of their essentially different physical origin and properties .",

    "we consider two qds placed in the @xmath2 plane and shifted by a vector @xmath3 .",
    "each qd is modeled as a two - level system ( empty dot and one exciton ) .",
    "the hilbert space of the double - dot system in our model is then spanned by the empty dot state @xmath4 , the two single exciton states @xmath5 corresponding to the exciton in the first and second dot , respectively , and the `` molecular biexciton '' state @xmath6 .",
    "the transition energies for the interband transitions in the two dots are @xmath7 the dots are coupled by an interaction @xmath8 which can be either of dipole  dipole character ( long - range _ dispersion force _ ) or result from carrier tunneling ( short - range , exponentially decaying interaction ) .",
    "we introduce the transition ( `` exciton annihilation '' ) operators for the two dots , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the exciton number operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 . using these operators , the hamiltonian of the double - dot system is written in the frame rotating with the frequency @xmath13 in the form @xmath14 where last term represents the biexciton shift .",
    "the long - range dipole coupling is described by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the spontaneous emission ( radiative recombination ) rate for a single dot , @xmath17 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath18 is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor , and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the speed of light and @xmath21 is the refractive index of the semiconductor , and @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the interband matrix element of the dipole moment operator which is assumed identical for both dots . for a heavy hole exciton , @xmath26^{t}$ ] , so that for a vector @xmath3 in the @xmath2 plane one has @xmath27 .",
    "the tunnel coupling is described by @xmath28    the effect of the coupling to the radiation field is accounted for by including the dissipative term in the evolution equations , which describes radiative recombination of excitons .",
    "the equation of evolution of the density matrix is then given by @xcite @xmath29 + \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta=1}^{2}\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta}\\left [   \\sigma_{\\alpha}\\rho\\sigma_{\\beta}^{\\dag } -\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { \\sigma_{\\alpha}^{\\dag}\\sigma_{\\beta},\\rho \\right\\}_{+ }   \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , with @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath32 denotes the anticommutator .",
    "the diagonal decay rates @xmath33 describe the emission properties from a single dot , while the off - diagonal terms @xmath34 , @xmath35 , account for the interference of emission amplitudes resulting from the interaction with a common reservoir and are responsible for the collective effects in the emission .    in our simulations , we use the parameters for a typical inas / gaas qd system : @xmath36  ns@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39  ev . for the tunnel coupling",

    "( a ) and ( b ) show the evolution for a pair of identical dots coupled by long - range dipole forces and by short - range tunnel coupling , respectively .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) show the evolution for a pair of non - identical dots , for the two kinds of couplings as previously .",
    "the labels a, ... ,e refer to the values of the inter - dot distance marked in fig .  [ fig : gv].,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] we show the results of the numerical simulations based on eq .  .",
    "on each plot , the average number of excitons in the system is shown as a function of time for identical dots ( @xmath44 ) and for slightly non - identical dots with @xmath45  mev .",
    "the initial state in all the cases is chosen to be @xmath46 .",
    "we study the decay of exciton population for various distances between the dots and compare the evolution for the two kinds of couplings .    for identical dots ,",
    "the exciton decay time for the delocalized initial state strongly depends on the distance between the dots .",
    "this is due to the oscillations and decay of the interference term @xmath42 . for dots placed at a short distance ( case a ) , @xmath47 and the decay",
    "has a strongly collective character , which manifested by the faster emission visible in figs .",
    "[ fig : decay](a , b ) @xcite . the collective effect gets weaker as the distance between the dots grows and @xmath42 decreases ( b ) . for some values of the distance , @xmath48 ( c ) .",
    "then , the amplitudes for photon emission from the two dots interfere destructively and the decay gets slower than the usual exponential decay with the rate @xmath49 ( the initial state becomes subradiant ) .",
    "whenever @xmath50 , the decay rate is the same as for an individual dot ( d ) .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig : decay](a ) and ( b ) shows that for identical dots , these effects do not depend on the coupling and are therefore the same , irrespective of the presence and physical nature of the interaction between the dots .    for dots that differ by the relatively small transition energy mismatch of @xmath51  mev , almost all this non - monotonic dependence of the emission rate on the distance disappears .",
    "the reason is that the oscillations of the interference term take place in the distance range where the coupling between the dots is very weak and is dominated already by a small energy mismatch assumed here , which destroys collectivity of the emission process @xcite .",
    "the only exception is the smallest distance shown in this plot , where the coupling is sufficiently strong . by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : decay](c ) and [ fig : decay](d ) one can see that also in this case , the evolution of the exciton occupation is nearly the same for both systems . here",
    "the tunnel coupling parameters have been deliberately chosen to assure the same coupling strength around the 6  nm distance . at larger distances",
    "both couplings are negligible compared to the energy mismatch .",
    "we have shown that the radiative decay of exciton occupation in a pair of coupled quantum dots depends on the distance between the dots as a result of the spatial dependence of the interference term governing the interaction with the quantum electromagnetic field . for non - identical dots ,",
    "the emission rate depends on the interplay of the energy mismatch between the dots and the coupling between them .",
    "although the two kinds of couplings that are present in the system ( tunneling and dipole interaction ) have essentially different physical nature and properties , they may lead to the same dynamics of the observed collective emission .",
    "we believe that these findings may shed some light on the interpretation of the experiment @xcite in which enhanced emission was observed in a quantum dot ensemble in which the dipole coupling energies on the typical inter - dot distances were much smaller than the average transition energy mismatch between the dots . indeed ,",
    "as we have shown , the tunnel coupling leads to the same effect as the long - range dipole interaction but it can be stronger than the latter at short distances .",
    "hence , it seems very likely that short - range tunnel coupling between some pairs of dots can be responsible for the observed collective emission effect in qd ensembles ."
