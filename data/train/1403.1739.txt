    "a detailed comparison of the boundaries between the phase exhibiting off - diagonal long range order and the disordered phase in this model and the model in ref .",
    "17 will be presented elsewhere . however , for the purpose of studying quantum quenches from the ordered ground state , it is sufficient to choose @xmath11 sufficiently small and @xmath6 negative .",
    "indeed , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the off - diagonal long range order , which reflects into the condensate fraction , is enhanced for small @xmath11 .",
    "the ( initial ) condensate fraction is also made larger by choosing a negative value of the nearest neighbor interaction , @xmath6 .",
    "physically , this is because a negative @xmath6 weakens the phase disordering effect of the hard - core repulsion , as it is also well known for models with short range hopping  @xcite .",
    "in addition , empirically we also found that larger starting condensate fraction also improves the numerical convergence in dmrg .",
    "we note that long - range interactions are of interest in a broad variety of problems : spin - chains with long - range interactions @xcite , non - interacting weakly disordered systems @xcite , quantum chaos @xcite , systems controlled by dipolar interactions @xcite and certain types of mott metal - insulator transitions @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is also believed that long range interactions provide an effective way of accounting for higher dimensional effects in one dimensional systems .",
    "this is because long - range interactions provide a way around the mermin - wagner theorem , which forbids the existence of spontaneous breaking of continuum symmetries long range in 1d quantum systems .",
    "thus , as mentioned above , the model exhibits long range phase coherence  @xcite in its ground state .",
    "below , we consider a quantum quench at @xmath12 , in which the long range tail ( i.e. the term proportional to @xmath13 in eq .  ) is suddenly turned off . in other words , we shall assume that the system is prepared in the ground state of eq .   with a @xmath14 such that a bona - fide bose - einstein condensate exists . following the quench ,",
    "the time evolution of the hamiltonian is described by the hard - core bose - hubbard model ,    @xmath15   + v\\sum_{m } \\hat{n}^{\\dag}_{m}\\hat{n}_{m+1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , we expect that , since the ground state of @xmath16 lacks long - range phase coherence ( i.e. is not a bec ) , but the latter is present in the initial state , the bec will be destroyed by the time evolution under @xmath16 . the question that we address here is how this destruction takes place .",
    "however , before describing the results of the dmrg simulation , it is worth dwelling on the role played by the parameter @xmath11 as an effective dimensionality . to this end",
    ", we can draw an analogy with a quantum quench in an array of 1d bosons .",
    "let us assume that each 1d system is described by a copy ( labeled by a new index @xmath17 ) of @xmath16 and is initially coupled to @xmath18 nearest neighbors by means of the following josephson tunneling term : @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 indicates sum over nearest neighbors and @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath18 approach infinity while @xmath22 remains constant . in this limit , which effectively amounts to infinite dimensions ,",
    "the mean - field approximation becomes exact and , the josephson coupling term becomes ( up to a constant ) @xmath23 , in which @xmath24 $ ] , with @xmath25 .",
    "using bosonization  @xcite , it is possible to map the mean - field hamiltonian in the continuum limit to a sine - gordon model  @xcite . in this setup ,",
    "a quench where the josephson coupling @xmath26 is suddenly turned off corresponds to suddenly turning off the sine - gordon term in the continuum model , a problem that has attracted much interest in recent times  @xcite . since the quench in the sine - gordon model is from a gapped to a critical state , we can rely on the boundary conformal field theory results of calabrese and cardy  @xcite , which predict that the order parameter will decay as : @xmath27 at asymptotically long times after the quench . in the above expression , @xmath28 is related to the size of the gap in the initial non - critical state ( which corresponds to the healing length of the initial condensate  @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior bears some resemblance to the result derived below using bosonization for the model with long - range hopping in eq .  , which is a stretched exponential for a generic value of @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "indeed , tentatively we may assume that the limit @xmath29 corresponding to infinite dimensions is akin to setting @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in general , we can regard the role of the parameter @xmath11 as controlling the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "this allows for a study of how long - range phase coherence is suppressed by fluctuations after an abrupt change in the dimension of the system .    however , the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite presumes that ( boundary ) conformal field theory is an exact description of the critical state .",
    "this ignores the existence of an infinite set of irrelevant operators that are responsible for the breaking of the infinite set of conservation laws that characterize the conformal field theory .",
    "therefore , eq .   is expected to hold at intermediate times , only . for longer times , the system will eventually transition to a different state .",
    "however , since @xmath16 is an integrable model  @xcite , the nature of such a state is not clear at the moment .",
    "we simulate the quench dynamics using the time - dependent dmrg ( t - dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "although the pre - quench hamiltonian contains terms involving power - law hopping between distant lattice sites , which make dmrg calculations less efficient , the post - quench hamiltonian contains only hopping to nearest - neighbors .",
    "therefore , the efficient time evolution algorithm based on the suzuki - trotter breakup @xcite can be employed .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we have plotted the spatial average of the single particle correlation function @xmath31 against the distance @xmath32 for different values of @xmath11 obtained by t - dmrg . as expected , long - range phase coherence , which manifest itself in a small variation of the single - particle correlation function , is present for sufficiently small @xmath11 . as described above , the initial state is therefore akin to a bose gas with short - range hopping and an effective higher dimensionality .",

    "the calculation of this behavior is beyond the scope of this work , as it requires taking into account an infinite number of irrelevant operators that are neglected in the bosonization approach .",
    "furthermore , we have not been able to determine whether the observed deviations from the sub - exponential behavior are due to the approximate treatment of the initial state and to the neglect of the open boundaries and finite size effects , which are inevitably present in the dmrg simulations .    for even longer times",

    "according to the kz scenario , after a quench , from a disordered phase , topological fluctuations are expected to survive for a long time in the final ordered phase . in the inverse kz scenario",
    "the quench is from the ordered to disordered phase .",
    "the resulting dynamics is characterized @xcite by a supercooled phase for short times and a slow proliferation of vortices for longer times that leads to an unexpected resilience of the superfluid state .",

    "we have argued that this is akin to a dimensionality quench , as the exponent characterizing the range of the hopping in the pre - quench hamiltonian plays the role of an effective ( non - integer ) dimensionality @xmath1 .",
    "our main result is the identification of two distinct regimes for the destruction of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) after the quench in effective dimensionality quench described above . at short times",
    ", we find a decrease of the bec fraction of the form @xmath123 , where @xmath114 is the initial bec fraction and @xmath112 is a constant . at longer times , this behavior crosses over to a different kind of time dependence . from a bosonization approach ( see sect .  [",
