    "the heavy quark content of the nucleon has been studied as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "event rates for charm production integrated over bins in @xmath8 and @xmath9 relevant to hera data have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "to further the study of deep - inelastic electroproduction of heavy quarks we have recalculated the virtual - photon - parton cross sections of @xcite in an exclusive fashion @xcite .",
    "this enables us to study the single and double differential distributions and correlations among all outgoing particles in the virtual - photon induced reaction @xmath10 with @xmath11 or @xmath12 jet and to easily incorporate experimental cuts . by examining distributions and correlations that are trivial at lowest order ( for example",
    ", the azimuthal angle between the heavy quark and the heavy antiquark ) one directly tests the hard scattering cross section that is predicted by perturbative qcd and factorization .",
    "therefore our results should give a clean test of nlo perturbative qcd .",
    "nevertheless we remind the reader that this is a fixed order perturbative calculation and suffers from the same problems as all nlo calculations .",
    "there are regions in phase space where it will break down .",
    "for example , in the above mentioned azimuthal angle distribution , if one looks at the prediction too near the back - to - back configuration there will be an extra enhancement of the cross section due to multiple soft gluon emission which is not included in our nlo result .    in this short report",
    "we discuss some details of the calculation and present interesting distributions .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal photon components are treated separately and the latest cteq3 parton densities @xcite , consistent with the newly released hera data @xcite , are used in the kinematic regime appropriate for production of charm quarks at hera .",
    "we make our predictions at fixed values of @xmath9 @xmath13 and @xmath8 @xmath14 .    we stress that here we only consider _ extrinsic _ heavy quark production , involving bethe - heitler and compton production from massless partons . for a discussion of _ intrinsic _ production , where the heavy quark is considered to be part of the proton s wavefunction ,",
    "see brodsky _ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "a variable flavor scheme which joins the extrinsic heavy flavor production picture at @xmath15 with a light mass parton density picture at @xmath16 has been discussed by aivazis _",
    "et al_.  @xcite . by comparing the fixed flavor scheme calculation of @xcite with the variable flavor number scheme of @xcite",
    "it is concluded in @xcite that the former yields the most stable and reliable results for @xmath17 in the threshold region ( @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the heavy quark ) .",
    "the contribution by w.l .",
    "van neerven to these proceedings reviews the progress towards implementing the variable flavour number scheme in nlo @xcite .    in our exclusive computation",
    "we use the subtraction method which is based on the replacement of divergent ( collinear or soft ) terms in the squared matrix elements by generalized plus distributions .",
    "this allows us to isolate the soft and collinear poles within the framework of dimensional regularization without calculating all the phase space integrals in a spacetime dimension @xmath20 as usually required in a traditional single particle inclusive computation . in this method",
    "the expressions for the squared matrix elements in the collinear limit appear in a factorized form , where poles in @xmath21 multiply splitting functions and lower order squared matrix elements .",
    "the cancellation of collinear singularities is then performed using the factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the squared matrix elements in the soft limit appear in a factorized form where poles in @xmath21 multiply lower order squared matrix elements .",
    "the cancellation of soft singularities takes place upon adding the contributions from the renormalized virtual diagrams .",
    "since the final result is in four - dimensional space time , we can compute all relevant phase space integrations using standard monte carlo integration techniques @xcite and produce histograms for exclusive , semi - inclusive , or inclusive quantities related to any of the outgoing particles .",
    "we can also incorporate any reasonable set of experimental cuts .",
    "our computer code has no small phase space slice parameters and the parameters defining the generalized plus distributions may be tuned to give fast numerical convergence , which is an advantage of using this subtraction method .",
    "analysis of the partonic reaction @xmath23 does not involve soft or virtual contributions so we can use it to most simply explain the method .",
    "one particular graph out of the order @xmath24 set is shown in fig.1 .",
    "we project this set of graphs on a particular photon polarization state @xmath25 and square the amplitude .",
    "the answer is written as @xmath26 where the coefficient absorbs overall factors .",
    "( 7,7 )    now we write the photon - parton cross section as @xmath27 where the 3 indicates a three - body final state . to proceed we need some notation for the variables",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . then if we introduce @xmath34 and @xmath35 we can write @xmath36 .",
    "this representation shows that @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "this @xmath39 divergence yields the collinear divergence in @xmath40 , which is due to the presence of the feynman graph in fig.1 . to handle this divergence",
    "we multiply and divide by @xmath39 so that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is now finite as @xmath43 and @xmath44 is divergent .",
    "we next replace the factor @xmath45 in the ( @xmath46-dimensional ) three - body phase space , where @xmath47 .",
    "this has the effect of splitting the @xmath46-dimensional cross section into two divergent parts .",
    "however it lets us take the limit @xmath48 and get back to 4-dimensions , with @xmath49 regularizing the collinear singularity . replacing the divergent factor @xmath50 in @xmath51 one obtains the following decomposition : ( for more details see @xcite ) @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54",

    "as the quark channel only contains collinear singularities , we also use it to illustrate how the generalized plus distributions are implemented numerically and how the @xmath49 dependence disappears in the sum ( [ quarkfinal ] ) . to this end consider @xmath65 where we have suppressed all indices and arguments of @xmath66 other than @xmath67 . in the bottom line",
    "we see that the infinity encountered at the lower integration limit @xmath68 is cancelled in the sum of the two integrals . in practice",

    "the second integral plus the factorized collinear contribution is commonly called the `` counter - event '' and may have either positive or negative weight .    the implementation of this procedure for the gluon channel is similar but more complicated due to the presence of both soft and collinear divergences .",
    "recalling that the probability density is related to the momentum density via @xmath77 we write the hadronic cross section as @xmath78 we now specialize to the case where @xmath79 is a proton , as in the case of hera . using the relations @xmath80 where @xmath81 with @xmath82 , and relations for the scaling functions , we find @xmath83 \\big\\ } \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 .",

    "this formula yields the standard heavy quark structure functions @xmath17 and @xmath88 for electron proton scattering , and we will present results as differentials of these functions . from the formalism described in the previous section we are left with events of positive weight and counter - events of either positive or negative weight .",
    "our program outputs the final state four vectors of the event and counter - event together with the corresponding weight .",
    "we histogram these into bins to produce differential distributions .",
    "( 7,7 )    we start by considering the production of charm quarks .",
    "we use @xmath89 and simply choose the factorization ( renormalization ) scale as @xmath90 .",
    "note that there are many possible choices of scale as we have all components of the final four vectors . aside from the @xmath91 dependence",
    ", this choice reduces to @xmath92 for electroproduction of massless quarks and @xmath93 for the photoproduction of charm quarks .",
    "we introduce a @xmath91 dependence by adding in the average of the magnitude of the transverse momenta of the heavy quark and heavy antiquark .",
    "as mentioned earlier we use the cteq3 m parton densities @xcite in the @xmath94 scheme and the two loop @xmath0 with @xmath95 .",
    "the first distribution we present basically measures the transverse momentum of the additional jet which recoils against the heavy quark pair .",
    "the @xmath91 distribution of the charm - anticharm pair is shown in fig . 2 where we plot @xmath96 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "( 7,7 )    the histograms are presented at fixed @xmath9= 12 @xmath97 for @xmath8 values of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "one sees that the @xmath91 distribution peaks at small @xmath91 and has a negative contribution in the lowest bin .",
    "this is a region where the dominant contribution is from counter - events so the weights can be negative .",
    "the results of this calculation require missing contributions from even higher order perturbation theory before this bin will have a positive weight .",
    "the depth of the negative bins is a function of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the choice of scale .",
    "note that at larger @xmath91 the structure function is dominated by the contribution from the square of the bremsstrahlung graphs so the weights are positive .",
    "figure 3 shows the corresponding results for fixed @xmath102 plotted for the @xmath9 values of @xmath103 @xmath104 , @xmath105 @xmath104 , @xmath106 @xmath104 and @xmath107 @xmath104 respectively .",
    "the distributions peak near small @xmath91 and are either small or negative in the first bin .",
    "the histograms with @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( the dotted line ) are the same in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "we have also used the same scales on the axes so one can easily see that there is a greater change if we fix @xmath8 and vary @xmath9 than if we fix @xmath9 and vary @xmath8 .",
    "we will continue to use the same scale for all the pairs of later plots to simplify the comparison between them .",
    "we now turn to the distributions in the azimuthal angle between the outgoing charm quark and charm antiquark which we denote as @xmath110 .",
    "this is the angle between the @xmath111 vectors of the heavy quark - antiquark in the c.  m.  frame of the virtual - photon - hadron system .",
    "since we integrate over the azimuthal angle between the plane containing the incoming and outgoing leptons and the plane defined by the incoming parton and outgoing heavy quark ( to limit our discussion to @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) we can only plot relative azimuthal correlations . in the born approximation this distribution is a delta function at @xmath114 , as their four momenta must balance . due to the radiation of the additional light mass parton ,",
    "the distribution has a tail extending below @xmath114 and has a valley at @xmath114 .",
    "the distributions become negative in the highest bins .",
    "this negative region is a general feature of all exclusive calculations .",
    "figure 4 shows results for @xmath115 at the same values of fixed @xmath9 and variable @xmath8 as chosen previously in fig .",
    "2 , while fig . 5 shows the results for fixed @xmath8 and variable @xmath9 as chosen previously in fig .",
    "3 . note again that the dotted histograms are the same in figs . 4 and 5 , and there is more variation for fixed @xmath8 and changing @xmath9 than for fixed @xmath9 and changing @xmath8 .    in this report",
    "we have outlined the nlo calculation of the virtual - photon - parton ( wilson ) coefficient functions in the fully differential production of heavy quarks plus one jet .",
    "more correlations and checks are given in @xcite .",
    "the computer program we have written for the exclusive calculation has the advantage that the four vectors of the heavy quark , heavy - antiquark and/or one additional light parton jet are produced for each event and can be subjected to experimental cuts .",
    "we have not done this in any of the plots shown here but the computer program is available and can be easily modified to incorporate acceptances of the detectors at hera .",
    "the program has been used to reanalyse the emc data on charm production in @xcite .",
    "in this report we have presented some plots which depend on information from the four vector of the additional jet .",
    "we showed the distributions in the transverse - momentum ( @xmath91 ) of the heavy quark antiquark pair and in the azimuthal angle ( @xmath110 ) between the @xmath111 vectors of the heavy quark and heavy antiquark .",
    "all quantities were predicted in the c.  m.  frame of the photon - proton system after integration over the azimuthal angle between the plane containing the incoming and outgoing lepton and the plane containing the incoming proton and outgoing heavy quark .",
    "the results were presented as distributions in @xmath17 at specific points in @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath116 .",
    "none of these distributions can be reproduced by any @xmath117-factor multiplication as the corresponding born distributions are proportional to delta - functions . in all cases",
    "the histograms of these distributions have negative bins .",
    "these are regions where the nlo calculation is not sufficient and a nnlo order calculation ( or some form of resummation ) should be made .",
    "a general statement about the magnitude of the nlo contribution compared to the lo one is difficult to make as the size and sign of the corrections may vary strongly between different regions of phase space .",
    "however , we see that all plots have larger @xmath9 variation at fixed @xmath8 as comparied to varying @xmath8 at fixed @xmath9 . by varying the renormalization ( factorization ) scale",
    "we observed that the distributions presented here changed in normalization but not in shape . in our study",
    "we also calculated averages of various quantities and found the typical variation between central and extreme scale choices of 5 percent for charm production .",
