    "<S> parametric expressions are used to calculate the isothermal susceptibility , specific heat , order parameter , and correlation length along the critical isochore and coexistence curve from the asymptotic region to crossover region . </S>",
    "<S> these expressions are based on the minimal - subtraction renormalization scheme within the @xmath0 model . using two adjustable parameters in these expressions , we fit the theory globally to recently obtained experimental measurements of isothermal susceptibility and specific heat along the critical isochore and coexistence curve , and early measurements of coexistence curve and light scattering intensity along the critical isochore of @xmath1he near its liquid - vapor critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the theory provides good agreement with these experimental measurements within the reduced temperature range @xmath2 . </S>"
