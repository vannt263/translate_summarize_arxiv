    "lithium is an ephemeral element in the atmospheres of low mass pre main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "it burns swiftly in @xmath1 reactions once the core temperature , @xmath2 , approaches @xmath3k , with a reaction rate approximately proportional to @xmath4 ( ushomirsky et al .",
    "1998 ) . because pms stars less massive than 0.35m@xmath5 are always fully convective , and because timescales for convective mixing are much shorter than evolutionary timescales ,",
    "the surface abundance of li is also rapidly depleted when the core reaches this li - burning temperature .",
    "thus , for stars of a given mass , total li depletion occurs over a relatively narrow range of effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "the time taken for @xmath2 to reach the li ignition point is sensitively dependent on mass and to a lesser extent on adopted equations of state and atmospheric boundary conditions . as a result ,",
    "if one observes a group of co - eval stars , the mass , and hence luminosity and temperature , at which li is observed to be depleted from its initial value , offers a potentially precise determination of stellar age .    analytical ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ; ushomirsky et al .",
    "1998 ) and numerical ( dantona & mazzitelli 1997 ( dam97 ) ; chabrier & baraffe 1997 ( cb97 ) ; burrows et al . 1997 ( b97 ) ) treatments of this process have appeared .",
    "these models confirm that the `` lithium depletion boundary '' ( ldb ) is an independent age diagnostic for clusters of stars .",
    "the technique is likely to be more accurate than the better known method of fitting the upper main sequence turn - off .",
    "this is partly because the uncertain physics in high mass stellar evolution models ( convective core overshoot , semi - convection , mass loss , rotational mixing ) has greater effects on the observable parameters than the debatable physics in low mass models ( equation of state , convection treatment and atmospheres ) , and partly because there are usually only a few high mass stars ( with uncertain duplicity ) with which to fit isochrones , whereas there are many low mass stars around the ldb .",
    "the ldb method is also potentially superior to fitting isochrones to pms stars as they descend towards the zams .",
    "the main hazard with this technique is the extremely uncertain conversions between colours and effective temperatures for @xmath6k .",
    "in this paper we provide an independent analysis of the likely experimental and systematic errors in the ldb technique .",
    "we also show that the ldb ages can be used in combination with observational data to yield the effective temperatures of low - mass stars and use this as an additional consistency check for the current generation of evolutionary models .",
    "our baseline assumption is that the age of a cluster is found by locating the ldb in a colour - magnitude diagram ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we convert the apparent magnitude of the ldb into an absolute magnitude and then into @xmath7 using an empirical bolometric correction at the colour of the ldb .",
    "we then use models for li depletion in cool stars to translate @xmath7 at the ldb into an age .",
    "note , that we _ do not _ use the @xmath0-colour relationships or bolometric corrections provided by some evolutionary models as these would instil unquantifiable errors in the procedure and in several cases , particularly in the optical , model colours have already been shown to be systematically in error ( baraffe et al . 1998 ) .    experimental errors in the ldb age can be ascribed to uncertain placement of the ldb in a colour - magnitude diagram due to sparse sampling in the li measurements , uncertain photometric calibrations and uncertainties in the distance and reddening of the cluster in question .",
    "systematic errors arise from the chosen empirical bolometric correction - colour relation , whether one assumes the ldb defines the point at which say 90% or 99% of li has been depleted and the choice of evolutionary model which defines the @xmath7-age relation at the ldb",
    ". the first two of these systematics will alter the ages of all clusters in qualitatively the same way , whereas the latter systematic may cause individual clusters to be older or younger , as the @xmath8-age relations cross for differing evolution models .",
    "there may of course be additional systematics due to common assumptions made by all the current generation of models .",
    "we have investigated these uncertainties , focussing on clusters with ldb ages defined in the @xmath9 vs @xmath10 diagram , and using the theoretical models of b97 , cb97 and dam97 .",
    "we find that for clusters with data quality similar to that available for the pleiades ( fig.1 ) , the experimental error in age rises from @xmath11 at @xmath12myr , to @xmath13 at 200myr .",
    "these errors are dominated by uncertain placement of the ldb ( typically @xmath14 mag in @xmath9 and @xmath15 in colour ) along with distance modulus errors and uncertainties in the @xmath9 photometric calibration ( both around @xmath16 mag ) .",
    "obtaining li data for more points around the ldb , distinguishing binaries from single stars and tightening up the photometric calibration could reduce these errors considerably . the increase in error with age",
    "is due to the propinquity of the li depletion isochrones at older ages .",
    "the systematic errors are more constant , ranging between @xmath17 and @xmath18 over a similar age range .",
    "the systematics are due mainly to the choice of model and whether there is any age dependence in the bolometric corrections as a function of colour , which are usually derived from mature stars .",
    "the influence of whether li is depleted by 90% or 99% at the ldb ( say for li 6708  ews @xmath19 ) only alters ages by @xmath20% .",
    ".ldb ages and errors for young clusters [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > \" , ]     table  1 and figure 1 present example results of our analysis for the pleiades , alpha per and ic 2391 clusters using li spectra , @xmath9 and @xmath10 data from the literature .",
    "the ages result from the average of using the cb97 , b97 and dam97 models .",
    "these ages are similar to those previously estimated ( stauffer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; barrado y navascus et al . 1999 ) , but the estimated errors are larger by a factor of two .",
    "this does not alter the main conclusions of this set of papers  that the ldb ages are older ( by a factor 1.6 or so ) than high mass turn - off ages with no core overshoot .",
    "however , the larger errors certainly obscure whether the amount of core overshoot required to bring turn - off and ldb ages into agreement might be mass dependent .",
    "the @xmath0-colour relationship in cool ( @xmath21k ) stars has long been a source of considerable uncertainty .",
    "if one _ knew _ the ages of clusters , then their photometric data provide an empirical isochrone from which a @xmath0-colour relationship can be derived , such that a theoretical isochrone at the same age will match the same data .",
    "if one further assumes the @xmath0-colour relationship is age - independent , then one could produce isochrones in colour - magnitude diagrams which should match other clusters at their ldb ages .",
    "we have performed these tests using the cb97 and dam97 models and with @xmath22 vs @xmath23 and @xmath9 vs @xmath10 diagrams , with very similar results .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of the empirical isochrone defined by the pleiades @xmath22 vs @xmath23 diagram obtained by choosing a @xmath0-colour relation to yield a good match at the ldb age and assuming a distance modulus of 5.6 .",
    "figure 3 shows the result of using this relationship to try and fit isochrones to the available ic 2391 data . the indicated isochronal age ( @xmath24myr ) is younger than the ldb age and",
    "may be in keeping with the more traditional nuclear turn - off age .",
    "there is some indication that the ages converge for the coolest stars in the sample .",
    "however , tests using the available @xmath10 data in the pleiades and ic 2391 for even cooler stars show that the discrepancy still exists there , so we attribute the convergence perhaps to poor photometric calibration at the most extreme colours . changing the age ( or distance modulus ) of the pleiades ( or ic 2391 ) within their errors makes no difference to this conclusion .",
    "using the hipparcos pleiades distance modulus of 5.3 makes the pleiades ldb age older by @xmath25myr and increases the discrepancy between isochronal and ldb ages for ic 2391 .",
    "could the discrepancy between isochronal and ldb ages , assuming a universal @xmath0-colour relationship , mean that there are systematic problems in the current generation of low - mass evolution models ? or , could the @xmath0-colour relationship change sufficiently between 50myr and 125myr to explain our results ?",
    "given the discrepancies between ldb and isochronal ages , this also begs the question as to how accurate isochronal ages derived in even younger clusters and associations could possibly be ? if the ldb ages are correct and our empirical isochrones are not , then the implication is that low - mass objects in very young star forming regions and associations could be twice as old as inferred from current evolutionary models combined with similar @xmath0-colour relations .",
    "the models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that any age dependence of the @xmath0-colour relationship is small in this age range .",
    "however , the reliability of the optical colours , particularly @xmath23 and @xmath10 , in these models has been called into question by the authors themselves , so any conclusions based on these is perhaps premature .",
    "unfortunately there is presently insufficient near ir data in young clusters , especially ic 2391 , to do a similar test in a spectral region where the model colours are likely to be more realistic .",
