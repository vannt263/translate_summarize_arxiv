    "the idea of market clearing prices seems to exist since more than 200 years ( _ cf .",
    "@xcite ) _ : prices of products are expected to adapt to the demand such that the demand is satisfied without any leftover products .",
    "a rigorous mathematical treatment in the special ( and particularly simple ) case of a `` two - sided market '' is presented in shapley and shubik s paper @xcite .",
    "the setup there consists of a set @xmath0 of _ items _ ( or `` sellers '' ) , a set @xmath1 of _ buyers _ and given _ valuations _ @xmath2 indicating the value that item @xmath3 has for buyer @xmath4 .",
    "one may assume _ w.l.o.g .",
    "_ that @xmath5 ( otherwise add dummy items of value @xmath6 for all buyers or dummy buyers with zero valuations for all items if necessary ) .",
    "relative to given prices @xmath7 , buyer @xmath4 will only be interested in items that yield him a maximum profit @xmath8 .",
    "let us call these items `` acceptable '' ( for buyer @xmath4 _ w.r.t .",
    "_ given prices @xmath9 ) . the price vector @xmath10 is _",
    "market clearing _ if there is a perfect matching of the buyers with the items such that each buyer is assigned to ( matched with ) an acceptable item .",
    "market clearing prices are easy to compute ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite or section [ s - clearing ] ) , even if we impose the additional requirement that @xmath11 should be minimal .",
    "buyer optimal _ market clearing prices turn out to be unique ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite or section [ s - clearing ] ) .",
    "the above setup is also interesting in the context of _ sealed bid auctions _ ,",
    "where buyers are called _ bidders _ : assume that an _ auctioneer _ is to assign the items @xmath12 to the buyers @xmath13 and compute prices @xmath9 to be paid by the buyers for the items they get assigned to .",
    "the auctioneer employs a _ mechanism _ performing this job ( computing an assignment and corresponding prices based on the reported valuations @xmath14 ) .",
    "such a mechanism is called _ incentive compatible _ if no bidder has any reason to lie about his valuations , _",
    "i.e. _ if telling his true valuations @xmath15 maximizes the profit @xmath8 of bidder @xmath4 ( where @xmath3 is the item he gets assigned to ) , irrespective of what the other bidders do . in game theoretic terms one would say that truthtelling is a _ dominant strategy _ for each bidder @xmath4 .",
    "a famous mechanism with this property is the so - called _ vcg mechanism _ , based on work by to vickrey @xcite , clarke @xcite and groves @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that each bidder should pay for `` the harm it does to the others '' ( _ cf .",
    "_ section [ s - vcg ] for details ) .",
    "+ in @xcite , the use of the vcg - mechanism for matching markets ( in particular sponsored search ) is motivated by saying that computation of market clearing prices `` can only be carried out by a search engine that actually knows the valuations '' @xmath16 of the bidders .",
    "vcg is known to be incentive compatible ( even in a more general setting , _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) , so bidders can indeed be assumed to report their true valuations , once they know that vcg is applied to compute the assignment and corresponding prices . +",
    "as it turns out , however , these vcg prices are exactly the buyer optimal prices @xmath9 which we could equally well compute by the standard price raising procedure ( _ cf . _ @xcite or section [ s - clearing ] ) and subsequent reduction to buyer optimal prices .",
    "the purpose of our note is to stress that - at least in the context of matching markets - vcg is just an alternative way of defining buyer optimal prices , or , to put it in another way , a means of showing that buyer optimal prices are incentive compatible .",
    "+ we do not claim that our findings ( in particular lemma [ buyeropt = vcg ] ) are completely new , but on the other hand we also did could not find them anywhere mentioned explicitly in the literature . actually , we only found one single document pointing out an equivalence between vcg and market clearing prices ( @xcite ) and this completely ignores the crucial buyer optimality .",
    "all others adopted the argument from easley and kleinberg s book mentioned above .",
    "+ in the following two sections we discuss market clearing prices , buyer optimality , and the equivalence with vcg in the context of matching markets .",
    "we aimed at a mainly selfcontained presentation ( assuming only basic knowledge on linear programming and bipartite matchings ) .",
    "let @xmath17 be the complete bipartite graph with node sets @xmath0 ( _ items _ ) and @xmath1 ( _ buyers _ ) , and assume _ w.l.o.g . _ that @xmath18 , say .",
    "( otherwise , add _ dummy _ items of value @xmath6 to all players or _",
    "dummy _ buyers with valuation @xmath6 for all items . )",
    "let @xmath19 denote the valuation of buyer @xmath20 for item @xmath21 .",
    "a _ matching _ in @xmath22 is a subset @xmath23 of paiwise non - incident edges .",
    "@xmath24 is _ perfect _ if it matches all nodes , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath25",
    ". the _ value _ of a matching @xmath24 is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "we let @xmath27    it is well - known that @xmath28 and a corresponding optimal matching @xmath29 can be found by solving the following linear program @xmath30 with variables @xmath31 indicating whether @xmath32 or not @xmath33 and its dual @xmath34 : @xmath35    the dual variable @xmath9 may be interpreted as _ price _ of item @xmath3 ( see also below ) . to each price vector @xmath36",
    "there is a corresponding best choice for @xmath37 , obtained by setting @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason we also refer to a given price vector @xmath39 as a `` dual solution '' ( without mentioning the corresponding @xmath37 ) . clearly , we may - and will - always assume @xmath40 _ w.l.o.g . _",
    "( by adding a suitable amount to all components of @xmath39 and subtracting the same amount from @xmath37 ) . + the _ price raising _ procedure ( _ cf .",
    "@xcite ) , in discrete optimization also known as _ hungarian method _",
    "( @xcite , _ cf . _ also @xcite ) is a rather efficient combinatorial algorithm for solving @xmath30 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is a special case of a primal - dual algorithm that subsequently modifies a feasible dual solution @xmath39 until a complementary ( hence optimal ) primal solution is found : + given a feasible dual solution @xmath41 , define the corresponding set of _ equality edges _ @xmath42 by complementary slackness , @xmath41 is optimal if there is a corresponding perfect matching @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. , _ a @xmath44 solution of @xmath30 with @xmath45 .",

    "dual feasibility ensures that any other item @xmath47 would result in a lower or equal profit @xmath48 .",
    "( this is why @xmath49 is called `` best sellers graph '' sometimes ( _ cf .",
    "+ starting , say , from @xmath50 , we successively seek to modify the current dual solution @xmath41 such that @xmath51 contains larger and larger matchings @xmath43 in each iteration , until eventually a perfect matching is reached ( and hence an optimal solution is found ) .",
    "+ thus assume @xmath41 is a current dual feasible solution and @xmath43 is a maximum ( non - perfect ) matching , _",
    "i.e. , _ there exists an unmatched @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the set of nodes that can be reached from @xmath4 along an @xmath24-alternating path in @xmath53 ( as indicated in the figure below ) .",
    "+    [ f - fig1 ]     each @xmath54 is matched by @xmath24 ( otherwise the @xmath24-alternating path from @xmath4 to @xmath3 were @xmath24-augmenting , contradicting our assumption that @xmath24 is maximum ) .",
    "moreover , the matching partners @xmath55 of @xmath56 are not joined to any node @xmath57 in @xmath53 ( any such @xmath3 would belong to @xmath56 by definition ) .",
    "hence we may increase @xmath39 on @xmath56 and decrease @xmath37 on @xmath58 , maintaining dual feasibility , until some @xmath59 joining @xmath60 to @xmath61 becomes an equality edge and we update ( enlarge @xmath56 correspondingly .",
    "after at most @xmath62 steps , a new dual feasible @xmath63 will be found , allowing a larger `` primal '' matching @xmath64 of size @xmath65 in the corresponding @xmath66 .",
    "+ after at most @xmath62 such iterations , we eventually end up with a dual feasible @xmath41 and a primal perfect matching @xmath43 in the corresponding @xmath53 .",
    "as explained earlier , given prices @xmath9 , buyer @xmath4 is ready to buy any item @xmath3 with @xmath67 as this will maximize his profit .",
    "this explains the notion of _ market clearing _",
    "prices for the optimal dual solutions on @xmath68 ( as these are exactly the ones that allow a complementary perfect matching @xmath69 ) .",
    "+ market clearing prices are by no means unique .",
    "for example , raising all prices by @xmath70 ( and decreasing @xmath37 correspondingly ) does not affect optimality .",
    "however , there is a unique optimal dual solution @xmath39 that is _ buyer optimal _ in that it minimizes @xmath11 ( recall that we assume all prices to be non - negative ) .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of shapley and shubik s @xcite `` lattice structure '' theorem :    [ shsh ] if @xmath71 are market clearing , so is @xmath72 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that @xmath39 , together with @xmath73 yields a feasible dual solution .",
    "( here @xmath74 are the dual variables corresponding to @xmath75 . ) furthermore , if @xmath24 is any maximum valuation perfect matching , then @xmath24 must be complementary with both @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78 for all @xmath79 .",
    "hence @xmath80 for all @xmath79 , proving that @xmath39 is market clearing as well .",
    "once we have computed market clearing prices @xmath39 by price raising as described above , we may further reduce them to unique buyer optimal prices in a similar way .",
    "the following observation is useful in this context ( one direction is proved in @xcite ) :    [ buyeropt ] let @xmath81 be market clearing and @xmath43 be a corresponding perfect matching in the corresponding equality graph @xmath53 .",
    "then the following are equivalent : + @xmath82 @xmath39 is buyer optimal + @xmath83 each @xmath84 is joined by an @xmath24-alternating path @xmath85 , starting and ending with a matching edge , to an item @xmath12 with @xmath86 .",
    "`` @xmath87 '' : assume @xmath39 is buyer optimal and @xmath84 .",
    "clearly , @xmath88  otherwise @xmath39 can not be buyer optimal ( decrease all @xmath9 by @xmath89 ) .",
    "let @xmath90 denote the set of items @xmath21 that can be reached from @xmath4 along @xmath24-alternating paths @xmath85 from @xmath4 , starting ( and ending ) with a matching edge . by definition of @xmath56",
    ", there is no edge in @xmath91 joining @xmath56 to any @xmath92 , where again @xmath55 denotes the set of matching partners of @xmath56 .",
    "hence , in case @xmath93 on @xmath56 , we may decrease @xmath39 on @xmath56 and increase @xmath37 on @xmath61 while staying dually feasible and complementary with @xmath24 .",
    "this would contradict the assumed minimality of @xmath39 .",
    "+ `` @xmath94 '' : assume that @xmath83 holds , but @xmath39 is not buyer optimal , _ i.e. , _ there exists a market clearing @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the matching partner of @xmath98 and let @xmath99 be the @xmath24-alternating path whose existence is guaranteed by @xmath83",
    ". as @xmath95 with corresponding @xmath100 is an optimal dual solution , complementarity with ( the optimal primal ) @xmath24 implies @xmath101 hence dual feasibility of @xmath102 yields @xmath103 a contradiction .",
    "lemma [ buyeropt ] suggests the following algorithm to reduce a given market clearing @xmath39 ( with corresponding @xmath37 and any fixed maximum valuation matching @xmath24 ) towards buyer optimality : first decrease all prices uniformly until @xmath86 for some item @xmath3 .",
    "check whether condition @xmath83 in lemma [ buyeropt ] is satisfied .",
    "if yes , we are done .",
    "otherwise pick any @xmath13 that violates condition @xmath83 and let @xmath90 denote the set of items that can be reached from @xmath4 along @xmath24-alternating paths starting ( and ending ) with a matching edge . by assumption , @xmath93 on @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , there are no edges in @xmath91 joining @xmath56 to @xmath104 . hence decreasing @xmath39 on @xmath56 and increasing @xmath37 on @xmath61",
    "maintains feasibility and hence optimality of the given dual solution ( note that @xmath105 remains constant ) .",
    "we therefore decrease @xmath39 on @xmath56 until eventually a new edge @xmath106 joining @xmath56 to @xmath104 enters @xmath91 , in which case we update ( enlarge ) the current set @xmath90 and continue .",
    "after at most @xmath62 steps , @xmath4 will get connected to an item @xmath3 with @xmath86 as required in condition @xmath83 and the iteration is complete .",
    "we finish our description of the algorithm by opbserving that , while proceeding this way ( trying to connect a current @xmath4 as above to the zero price items ) , we never destroy any @xmath24-alternating paths connecting other buyers @xmath107 to zero price items .",
    "indeed if any such path @xmath108 would pass through @xmath109 as above , then also @xmath4 were connected to zero price items ( follow the @xmath24-alternating path from @xmath4 to @xmath3 and then switch to @xmath108 ) .",
    "thus , indeed , after at most @xmath62 iterations we will eventually reach an optimal dual solution @xmath41 satisfying condition @xmath83 in lemma [ buyeropt ] , _",
    "i.e. , _ buyer optimal prices @xmath39 .",
    "+ in section [ s - vcg ] we will see how buyer optimal prices arise in a natural ( and at the first glance different ) way in the context of sealed bid auctions .",
    "the general idea behind vcg mechanisms is that items should be assigned to buyers so as to maximize the total valuation ( `` social welfare '' ) and that prices are determined so that each buyer @xmath4 pays for the `` harm he does to the others '' by taking the item ( or , in more general situations , the goods ) assigned to him .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath24 be any maximum valuation matching of value @xmath110 .",
    "for any @xmath79 compute @xmath111 , the maximum valuation of a matching when bidder @xmath4 is removed or ( to maintain our assumption @xmath5 ) replaced by a dummy bidder with valuation @xmath6 for all items .",
    "+ we then compare this to @xmath112 , the maximum valuation if buyer @xmath4 has left and taken item @xmath3 .",
    "the difference between these two , _",
    "@xmath113 is the harm that buyer @xmath4 does to the others if he takes away item @xmath3 and , in vcg - terminology , this is the _ personalized _ price @xmath114 of item @xmath3 _ for _ buyer @xmath4 .",
    "the vcg mechanism then assigns items to buyers according to the optimal matching @xmath24 and asks each buyer @xmath4 to pay his price @xmath115 for the item @xmath3 he is assigned to .        as @xmath24 is a maximum valuation matching , so is @xmath118 for the subgraph @xmath119 for any @xmath79 .",
    "in other words , @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "+ secondly , observe what happens if we replace @xmath4 by a dummy bidder : let @xmath122 correspond to @xmath39 , so that @xmath123 . by lemma [ buyeropt ] , there exists an @xmath24-alternating path @xmath108 from @xmath4 to some zero priced item @xmath3 .",
    "construct a new matching @xmath124 by switching @xmath24 along @xmath108 ( thereby unmatching @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and matching @xmath3 and @xmath4 with each other .",
    "correspondingly , obtain @xmath125 from @xmath37 by decreasing @xmath126 to @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath124 is ( still ) complementary with @xmath127 and hence optimal .",
    "thus @xmath128 .",
    "consequently , the vcg price that @xmath4 has to pay for the item @xmath3 that is assigned to him equals @xmath129 as claimed . .",
    "vcg prices have the desirable property of being _ incentive compatible _ : buyers can not profit by lying about their true valuations @xmath16 .",
