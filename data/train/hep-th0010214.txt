    "the study of spherical geometry in casimir effect meets a lot of technical problems , the most difficult one is the problem of divergences , which appear in many expressions .",
    "the special interest to the subject raised after the series of articles by julian schwinger where he had suggested a connection between casimir effect and sonoluminescence @xcite .",
    "different regularizations were used to obtain finite results in spherical geometry , however , results of the calculations strongly depended on the regularization scheme and regularization parameters ( a discussion of divergences and their regularization can be found in @xcite ) . in the pesent paper we show that it is necessary that regularization parameters be present even in final expressions , they have real physical meaning and we will clarify it .",
    "we study a dielectric nonmagnetic ball of radius @xmath0 and permittivity @xmath1 , surrounded by a vacuum .",
    "the ball is dilute , i.e. all final expressions are obtained under the assumption @xmath2 .",
    "dispersion is essential in the following , so the permittivity @xmath1 depends on frequency .    in section",
    "@xmath3 we follow the formalism which was developed by e.lifshitz et.al.@xcite and k.milton et.al.@xcite .",
    "we start from a short overview of known facts .",
    "then we derive casimir - polder type energy of interaction between a dielectric ball and a particle of constant polarizability @xmath4 , which is placed at the distance @xmath5 from the centre of the ball . the addition theorem for bessel functions is used .",
    "another application of this technique can be found in @xcite where casimir energy of polarizable particle located in the neighbourhood of perfectly conducting wedge was calculated . in section @xmath6 the equivalence of dipole - dipole interaction and casimir energy in the lowest order @xmath7 is proved for homogeneous dielectric media .",
    "this fact is used in section @xmath8 to calculate non - dispersive contribution to the energy , dispersive contribution is briefly discussed .",
    "we argue that casimir surface force is attractive in a realistic model of dielectric ball and includes volume and surface terms in the order @xmath7 .",
    "various regularizations are reviewed in the appendix .",
    "we put @xmath9 .",
    "heaviside - lorentz units are used .",
    "the change in the ground state energy @xmath10 of the system under the infinitesimal variation of @xmath1 is @xmath11 here @xmath12 is a fourier component of electric field propagator trace , it satisfies equations @xmath13",

    "when the point particle of constant polarizability @xmath4 is inserted into the point @xmath25 , @xmath26 from the centre of the ball , the energy change is given by ( [ f1 ] ) with @xmath27 .",

    "doing so , we have to substitute @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 in all expressions , where @xmath34 the casimir - polder energy of this configuration is @xmath35 we perform a euclidean rotation then : @xmath36 , @xmath37 let @xmath38 .",

    "to proceed , the following addition theorem for bessel functions @xcite is useful : @xmath45 to our knowledge this formula was first used in casimir effect calculations in @xcite , where it was applied to analytic calculation of casimir energy of perfectly conducting spherical shell and dilute dielectric ball satisfying @xmath46 .    in our case",
    "it can be applied as follows .",
    "the simple identity holds ( @xmath47 for definiteness ) : @xmath48 where we have used @xmath49 only the first order @xmath50 is needed in @xmath51 .",

    "finally we get @xmath53 substitution @xmath54 in the limit @xmath55 yields @xmath56 thus in this limit the famous casimir - polder energy of interaction between two polarizable particles @xmath57 @xcite can be obtained directly from ( [ f20 ] ) .",

    "it is straightforward to obtain @xmath70    now suppose that @xmath71 satisfies ( [ p22 ] ) with @xmath72 in all space . then we insert dielectric of arbitrary shape with constant dielectric permittivity @xmath73 so that @xmath74 . for this case @xmath15-function in ( [ p25 ] )",
    "has to be substituted by function equal to @xmath75 outside the dielectric and equal to @xmath76 inside the dielectric .",

    "according to general properties of dielectric permittivity on imaginary axis it is poissible to use @xmath89 and @xmath90 instead of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so ( [ p30 ] ) for @xmath87 yields casimir - polder potential @xmath93 for @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is atomic size ) frequencies @xmath96 give essential contribution to ( [ p30 ] ) .",
    "then the last term in ( [ p30 ] ) gives main contribution and @xmath97 formulas ( [ p31 ] ) and ( [ p32 ] ) are non - dispersive and dispersive contributions to the energy of interaction of two neutral atoms .",
    "the change in the ground state energy of a dilute dielectric ball is generally equal @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the volume of the ball .",
    "usually only the first term had been taken into account in the calculations of casimir force and , as a consequence , the number of particles inside the ball was nt conserved and the repulsive force resulted in most calculations . however , from physical considerations all atoms constituting the ball interact at large distances by attractive casimir - polder potential , so non - dispersive component of the force should be attractive .",
    "conservation of the number of atoms inside the ball is equivalent to the conditions @xmath100    we start from the first term contribution to ( [ p1 ] ) which we denote @xmath101 .    ,",

    "when particles are inserted into the ( infinitely small ) shaded area near point @xmath102 , they interact via casimir - polder ( retarded ) potential with particles inside a ball of radius @xmath0 separated by distances @xmath103 from the point @xmath102 , i.e. they interact via casimir - polder potential with particles inside the shaded region of the ball ( regions @xmath104 )",
    ". particles separated from the point @xmath102 by distances @xmath105 interact with particles near point @xmath102 via van der waals ( non - retarded ) potential .",
    "obviously the situation is simplified for clarity here .",
    "generally one has to take the concrete model of dispersion for dielectric permittivity , integrate interaction of particles near point @xmath102 via potential ( [ p29 ] ) with particles separated by distances greater than interatomic distances from point @xmath102 and calculate the energy change according to formula ( [ p1 ] ) . as we are not intending to study specific model of dispersion here but rather want to get a suitable approximation for low - frequency contribution to the energy , we approximate area of integration by its division on the retarded region ( @xmath103 ) and non - retarded region ( @xmath106 ) . according to discussion in the previous section , for distances @xmath103 the frequency dispersion",
    "can be neglected , so this region in our approximation gives non - dispersive contribution to the energy , the region @xmath106 gives main dispersive contribution to the energy .",
    "area of integration for non - dispersive case is shaded on fig.2 , so in our approximation the non - dispersive contribution to @xmath101 can be written as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are densities of particles in a unit volume . the integral over the region @xmath110 can be simply obtained from ( [ g1 ] ) and arguments of the previous section .",
    "we just substitute @xmath111 in formula ( [ g1 ] ) according to fig.2 and obtain : @xmath112 the integral ( [ p3 ] ) over the region @xmath113 can be calculated analytically using ( [ ff1 ] ) : @xmath114 from ( [ p3 ] ) , ( [ p4 ] ) and ( [ p5 ] ) after integration over @xmath0 ( keeping @xmath115 ) we obtain expression for @xmath116 : @xmath117 here @xmath99 and @xmath118 are volume and surface area of the ball respectively . expression ( [ p6 ] ) looks similar to formula ( [ y3 ] ) obtained by g.barton @xcite in the framework of quantum mechanical perturbation theory .",
    "there is still a little difference between these formulas . at first sight",
    "it seems that in our approach it is impossible to find the term proportional to @xmath119 and this term has no influence on the force .",
    "however , this is not so .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath119 is determined uniquely in our approach when taking into account the second term in ( [ p1 ] ) and equation ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "figure 3 : contributions to @xmath120    now we turn to the second term in ( [ p1 ] ) and calculate its non - dispersive contribution to the energy change denoted by @xmath120 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates different areas of integration over variable @xmath121 and analogous to fig.2 in a sence  it is necessary to integrate casimir - polder potential between ( infinitesimally small area around ) point @xmath122 ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) and shaded area of the ball separated from point @xmath122 ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) by distances @xmath103 and then integrate over points @xmath122 ,",
    "@xmath123 , @xmath124 inside the ball .",
    "this term can be written as follows : @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath25 are integrated over all points inside the ball of radius @xmath0 satisfying the condition @xmath127 .    to facilitate understanding of calculations in what follows we present major steps explicitly .",
    "let us denote @xmath128 and write @xmath120 ( after comparison with ( [ p5 ] ) and fig.3 everything should be clear ) : @xmath129 the expression for non - dispersive force on a unit surface can be obtained using ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) : @xmath130 this force is attractive for @xmath131 , which reflects attractive nature of casimir - polder potential .    to calculate energy , one has to take into account equation ( [ p2 ] ) and integrate force . as a result ,",
    "@xmath132 the term proportional to @xmath119 is determined uniquely now .",
    "moreover , comparison of ( [ p6 ] ) and ( [ p11 ] ) shows internal self - consistence of our approach .",
    "the formulas for casimir - polder energy of interaction between a polarizable particle and a dilute dielectric ball ( [ g1]),([f20 ] ) and non - dispersive contribution to casimir surface force on a dilute dielectric ball ( [ p10 ] ) are derived analytically .",
    "our approach directly shows correspondence of this force and casimir - polder potential . in section @xmath6",
    "this topic has been investigated from general viewpoint for arbitrary homogeneous dielectric media .",
    "the proof of equivalence in summation via casimir - polder - van der waals type potentials and casimir energy in the lowest @xmath7 order is the subject of section @xmath6 .",
    "this equivalence made it possible to calculate non - dispersive contribution to casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball by direct summation of casimir - polder potential . when the number of atoms constituting dilute ball is assumed constant during the ball expansion , the casimir surface force is attractive and includes volume and surface terms in the order @xmath7 .",
    "for the benefit of the reader it is helpful to give here an overview of different approaches which have been used to derive the finite when @xmath133 term @xmath134 in the energy expression ( [ p11 ] ) .",
    "first attempts to calculate casimir energy of a dielectric ball gave a lot of different answers , as it is described in @xcite . the mathematical reason for some of these differences",
    "was found in the work @xcite , where by use of debye expansion for bessel functions and @xmath135-function the correct limits on @xmath136 were established . later in the article @xcite",
    "the term @xmath136 was calculated numerically with high accuracy , which made it possible to establish equivalence of casimir effect and retarded van der waals ( or casimir - polder ) energy for the case of non - dispersive dielectric ball .",
    "mutual retarded van der waals energy for molecules inside the compact sphere ( ball ) was calculated by k.milton and y.ng @xcite and its finite part after regularization in terms of gamma functions was first given by @xmath136 in the work @xcite .    in the article",
    "@xcite casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball was studied via the formula which has the following form for nondispersive case : @xmath137 where @xmath138 and riccati - bessel functions are assumed to depend on argument @xmath139 .",
    "recently the formula ( [ y1 ] ) has been studied in the mode summation method @xcite , there divergent terms have been analysed and the finite result @xmath136 has also been derived by making use of addition theorem for bessel functions .",
    "another approach based on quantum mechanical perturbation theory was suggested by g.barton in the work @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy was obtained there in the form : @xmath144 here @xmath99 is the volume and @xmath118 the surface area , @xmath119 is an exponential cutoff on wavenumbers . in this approach",
    "the contact terms havent been subtracted , this is why the term proportional to @xmath145 is present in ( [ y3 ] ) .",
    "we have already discussed this formula in section @xmath8 , its structure is similar to ( [ p11 ] ) .",
    "the cutoff independent term is essentially the same in all approaches .",
    "the theory of qed in a dielectric background was studied in @xcite by path integral and @xmath135-function methods .",
    "@xmath135-function can be written as in @xcite : @xmath146 for a dilute ball it is possible to expand the logarithm in powers of @xmath145 , here we consider only the order @xmath147 of this expansion : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is defined in ( [ y4 ] ) .",
    "detailed derivation of the finite part of @xmath135 - function deserves a single article , here for completeness we only present the result for its finite part @xmath150 : @xmath151 with no poles in this expression for @xmath152 . from this expression",
    "we find @xmath153 we only note that even @xmath135-function method meets severe problems with analytic continuation and regularization in the case of a dilute dielectric ball .",
    "most divergences and problems met so far in different approaches are related to short distance behaviour . in this article",
    "it is shown explicitly that such problems arise when parameter @xmath133 .",
    "in dielectric media in the real world @xmath154 , this is why the main problem which still remains in other approaches is not to remove regularization , but to identify parameters of regularization in final expressions with physical quantities ."
