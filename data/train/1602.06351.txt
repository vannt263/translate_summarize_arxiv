    "the identities themselves are of independent interest  even in the case of @xmath14 , where a special case is basmajian s orthospectrum identity for a hyperbolic surface .      if @xmath15 is a compact hyperbolic surface with geodesic boundary , an _",
    "@xmath16 is a properly immersed geodesic arc perpendicular to @xmath17 .",
    "basmajian ( @xcite ) proved the following identity : @xmath18 where the sum is taken over all orthogeodesics @xmath19 in @xmath15 .",
    "the geometric meaning of this identity is that there is a canonical decomposition of @xmath17 into a cantor set ( of zero measure ) , plus a countable collection of complementary intervals , one for each orthogeodesic , whose length depends only on the length of the corresponding orthogeodesic .    for simplicity , one can look at surfaces with a single boundary component .",
    "a hyperbolic structure on @xmath15 is the same as a discrete faithful representation @xmath20 acting on the upper half - plane model in the usual way .",
    "after conjugation , we may assume that @xmath21 stabilizes the positive imaginary axis @xmath22 .",
    "orthogeodesics correspond to double cosets of @xmath23 in @xmath24 . for each nontrivial double coset @xmath25",
    ", the hyperbolic geodesic @xmath26 corresponds to another boundary component of @xmath27 , and the contribution to basmajian s identity from this term is @xmath28 ; hence @xmath29    if we deform @xmath30 to some nearby representation @xmath31 , and replace each @xmath30 by @xmath32 above , we obtain a formula for the _ complex length _ of @xmath33 .",
    "this is the desired complexification of basmajian s identity .",
    "the identity makes sense , and is absolutely convergent , exactly throughout the subset @xmath34 of schottky space @xmath35 where the hausdorff dimension of the _ limit set _ of @xmath36 is less than one .",
    "since @xmath37 is multivalued , it is important to choose the correct branch at a real representation , and then follow the branch by analytic continuation .",
    "the space @xmath34 is not simply - connected and some terms exhibit monodromy ( in the form of integer multiples of @xmath38 ) when they are analytically continued around homotopically nontrivial loops .",
    "if the complex parameter @xmath39 is less than @xmath40 , the julia set @xmath41 of the quadratic polynomial @xmath42 is a cantor set of zero measure contained in the real line .",
    "thus there is a natural basmajian - type identity associated to @xmath41 .",
    "if we perturb @xmath39 off the real line in the complement of the mandelbrot set @xmath43 , we obtain a formal family of complexified identities , depending holomorphically on @xmath39 .",
    "analogous to the case of basmajian s identity , the complexified identity holds exactly on the subset @xmath44 of @xmath45 where the hausdorff dimension of the julia set is strictly less than one .",
    "@xmath46 and the generator induces new monodromy terms in the series identity .",
    "our criterion for convergence gives us a method to numerically compute the locus in @xmath45 where the hausdorff dimension of @xmath41 is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "experimentally this locus appears to be a topological circle with a `` cusp '' at @xmath40 .",
    "our main analytic result  the relation between the growth rate of the terms in the right hand side of the identities and the hausdorff dimension  is proved by using the thermodynamic formalism developed by ruelle , bowen and others in the 1970 s .",
    "the main geometric idea is that the spectrum of the transfer operator is controlled by the geometric contraction rate of sets in a suitable markov partition , and this in turn can be related to the size of the terms in the identity , precisely because the dynamical systems are conformal .",
    "dirichlet s unit theorem expresses certain covolumes ( of units in an algebraic number field ) in terms of special values of @xmath47-functions , which have a series decompostion , of which the riemann zeta function is the simplest example .",
    "basmajian s identity expresses in a similar way a ( co)volume as a series , expressed over topological terms .",
    "we suggest that the study of our families of basmajian - type identities is analogous to the idea of studying @xmath47-functions expressed in series form .      in section 2 , we consider an elementary example of our general theory , namely the case of an iterated function system generated by a pair of planar similarities .",
    "in section 3 , we study complexified basmajian s identity for schottky groups and exhibit loops in @xmath34 with nontrivial monodromy .",
    "the main theorem of this section is the following :    3.10complexified basmajian s identity suppose @xmath48 is a fuchsian marking corresponding to a hyperbolic surface @xmath15 with geodesic boundaries @xmath49 .",

    "moreover , the series converges absolutely .    here",
    "@xmath55 is a set of double coset representatives associated to boundary components @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the key ingredient in the proof of the theorem is the following analytic result , whose proof is deferred until section 6 .",
    "3.8 given a marked schottky representation @xmath58 , the infinite series ( [ intro_cx_bas_id ] ) converges absolutely if and only if the hausdorff dimension of the limit set @xmath59 of the schottky group @xmath60 is strictly less than one .    in section 4 we study basmajian - type identities for quadratic polynomials and numerically plot the hausdorff dimension one locus in @xmath45 .",
    "our main results are the following :    4.4 for complex parameter @xmath61 , let @xmath62 and @xmath63 be the two branches of @xmath64 and @xmath65 be the fixed point of @xmath62 , then the following identity holds @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of @xmath63 s in the word @xmath68 .",

    "we review elements of the thermodynamic formalism and introduce the main technical tools we will need .",
