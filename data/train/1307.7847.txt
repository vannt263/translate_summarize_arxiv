    "modern data analysis often faces the task of extracting characteristic features from sets of elements singled out according to some measurement . in molecular biology , for example , an experiment may lead to measurement results pertaining to genes and then questions are asked about the properties of genes for which these were high or low .",
    "this is an example , of course , and the set of elements does not have to be genes . they can be genomic regions , proteins , structures , etc . a central technique for addressing the analysis of characteristic properties of sets of elements is statistical enrichment .",
    "more specifically  the experiment results are often representable as ranked lists of elements and we then seek enrichment of other properties of these elements at the top or bottom of the ranked list .",
    "gsea @xcite , for example , is a tool that addresses characteristic features of genes that are found to be differentially expressed in a comparative transcriptomics study .",
    "gorilla @xcite addresses go terms enriched in ranked lists of genes where the ranking can be , for example , the result of processing differential expression data or of correlations computed between genomic dna copy number and expression  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "fatigo @xcite is also a tool that is useful in the context of analyzing go terms in ranked lists of genes .",
    "drimust @xcite , @xcite searches for sequence motifs that are enriched , in a statistically significant manner , in the top of a ranked list of sequences , such as one produced by techniques like chip - seq .",
    "all the aforementioned tools utilize a statistical approach that is based on assessing enrichment of an input set in an input ranked list by assessing the enrichment obtained at various cutoffs applied to the ranked list .",
    "it is often the case , however , that two quantitative properties need to be compared to each other .",
    "for example , when the elements are genes , we may have measured differential expression values , as well as measured chip - seq signals .",
    "we are therefore interested in assessing mutual enrichment in two ranked lists .",
    "another example consists of one ranking according to differential expression and one according to prediction scores for mirna targets .",
    "mitea @xcite addresses this latter case by statistically assessing the enrichment of mirna targets in a ranked list of genes ( also see @xcite ) . to address mutual enrichment in two",
    "ranked lists over the same set of _ n _ elements , mitea @xcite performs analysis on permutations .",
    "mutual enrichment in the top of two ranked lists can be simplified , from a mathematical point of view , by arbitrarily setting the indices of one list to the identity permutation @xmath0__n _ _ ) and treating the other list as a permutation @xmath1 over these numbers . for the purpose of assessing the intersection of the top of the two ranked lists in a data driven manner",
    ", mitea asks which prefix @xmath2 $ ] is enriched in the first @xmath3 elements of that permutation , @xmath4 .",
    "the statistics introduced by mitea is called mmhg ( min - min - hyper - geometric ) .",
    "a variant of mmhg is explained in detail in section 2 of the current manuscript .",
    "statistics in the group of permutations @xmath5 is often difficult because the number of entities to be considered by any null model is _ n _ ! direct exhaustive calculation of tail distributions over @xmath5 is therefore impractical for all but very small values of _ n_. this difficulty is addressed by several heuristic techniques .",
    "mapping into continuous spaces , such as in @xcite , has proven useful in certain cases but not for studying large deviations . in the case of enrichment statistics that focuses on the top of the permutation and seeks to assess extreme events , such as mmhg , we prefer to use bounds on tail probabilities .",
    "tail probabilities are useful constructs when applied to analyzing molecular biology measurement data as they enable statistical assessment of observed results .    in this work",
    "we derive a tight bound on the tail probabilities of the mutual enrichment at the top of two random permutations uniformly drawn over @xmath5 and demonstrate the utility of this approach in the context of flexible motif discovery .",
    "our bounds are computable in polynomial time and potentially add to the accuracy of reported position weight matrix ( pwm ) motifs for nucleic acid sequences .",
    "the mmhg statistics  @xcite is a generalization of the mhg statistics  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite . while the mhg statistics quantifies the enrichment level of a set of elements at the top of a ranked list of elements of the same type , the mmhg statistics quantifies the level of mutual enrichment in two ranked lists over the same set of elements . while any parametric or non - parametric correlation statistics ( e.g. spearman s correlation coefficient ) , that takes the same input , calculates the overall agreement between the two ranked lists , the mmhg statistic focuses only on agreement at the top of the two ranked lists .",
    "mmhg counts elements common to the top of both lists , without predefining what top is .",
    "its intended output is the probability for observing an intersection at least as large in two randomly ranked lists ( the enrichment mmhg _",
    "p - value _ ) . in this section",
    "we describe the mmhg statistics and in later sections we suggest a tight bound for the p - value .",
    "our definition of the mmhg statistic varies slightly from that of steinfeld _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "mutual enrichment in the top of two ranked lists can be simplified , from a mathematical point of view , by arbitrarily setting the indices of one list to the identity permutation @xmath0__n _ _ ) and treating the other list as a permutation .",
    "details of this transform are given in section 2.3 .",
    "we now define mmhg for the simple case of one permutation .",
    "consider a permutation @xmath6 - the group of all permutations over the numbers @xmath7 .",
    "mmhg is a function that takes @xmath1 and calculates two numbers @xmath8 such that the observed intersection between the numbers @xmath9 and the first @xmath10 elements of @xmath11  is the most surprising in terms of the hypergeometric p - value .",
    "additionally , mmhg further calculates this aforementioned p - value .",
    "formally , given @xmath12 and for every @xmath8 , let @xmath13 be the size of the intersection of @xmath9 with @xmath14 .",
    "set @xmath15 where hgt is the tail distribution of an hypergeometric random variable :    @xmath16    the mmhg score can not be considered as a significance measure , due to the multiple testing involved in finding @xmath17 and @xmath10 .",
    "a simple way to correct an mmhg score s for multiple testing and report a p - value bound would be to use the bonferroni correction . that is done by multiplying s by the number of multiple tests conducted which is @xmath18 .",
    "therefore : @xmath19 in section 3 we present significantly tighter bounds .",
    "data produced by techniques such as chip - seq  @xcite , chip - exo  @xcite , clip  @xcite , par - clip  @xcite and others are readily representable as ranked lists of sequences , where the ranking is according to measured binding affinity .",
    "computational tools and approaches to motif discovery form part of the data analysis workflow that is used to extract knowledge and understanding from this type of studies .",
    "we are often interested in sequence motifs that are observed to be enriched in sequences where strong binding affinity is measured .",
    "a position weight matrix ( pwm ) is a commonly used representation of motifs in biological sequences  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this representation is more faithful to biology than representation by exact words .",
    "a pwm is a matrix of score values that gives a weighted match to any given substring of fixed length .",
    "it has one row for each symbol of the alphabet , and one column for each position in the pattern .",
    "the score assigned by a pwm to a  substring _ s _ = @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 , where _ j _ represents position in the substring , @xmath22  is the symbol at position  _ j _  in the substring , and @xmath23 is the score in row  @xmath24 , column  _ j _ of the matrix . in other words ,",
    "a pwm score is the sum of position - specific scores for each symbol in the substring .",
    "this definition can be generalized to yield a score for a sequence _ s _",
    "= @xmath25 longer than the pwm by calculating @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , an enhanced model that takes into account multiple occurrences of the pwm in the sequence can be applied by summing over sufficiently strong occurrences of the pwm or by other more sophisticated approaches  @xcite .      given a set of sequences that were tested in a high throughput experiment such as chip - seq  @xcite , clip  @xcite and others",
    ", they can be ranked according to the measured binding affinities , yielding a ranked list @xmath27 .",
    "since usually we are interested in finding motifs amongst sequences having strong binding affinities , we actually search for motifs that are more prevalent at the top of this list .",
    "it is clear that any algorithm for de - novo flexible motif search would need to evaluate candidate pwms . given a pwm which we want to assess , the sequences can also be ranked according to their pwm scores , yielding another ranked list @xmath28 , different from @xmath27 . a significant pwm motif would yield significant scores for sequences having strong binding affinities .",
    "therefore , the question of pwm motif discovery from ranked experimental data can be formulated as quantifying the mutual enrichment level for the two ranked lists @xmath27 and @xmath28 . given two ranked lists @xmath27 and @xmath28 over the universe of _ n _ sequences , they can be transformed into two respective permutations , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the relative permutation @xmath1 , of @xmath31 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath32 , is defined by @xmath33 , for every @xmath34 or simply , using the operations in the group @xmath35 .",
    "using the relative permutation @xmath1 , we can represent the mutual enrichment of the top parts of @xmath27 and @xmath28 as _ mmhg _ _",
    "score_(@xmath1 ) , defined above .",
    "given an mmhg score _ s _",
    ", observed in analyzing real measurement data , we would like to assess the statistical significance of this observation . assuming endless computational power",
    ", we would enumerate all permutations and calculate the mmhg score for each , in order to characterize the distribution of mmhg as a random variable over @xmath5 .",
    "the p - value for _ s _ is then simply : @xmath36    since the number of permutations is huge , the process described above is very far from feasible . therefore , we seek a computationally tractable upper bound , preferably tight .",
    "a trivial upper bound is the bonferroni corrected mmhg score defined by @xmath37 .",
    "a more subtle upper bound was suggested by steinfeld _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and is briefly described in section 3.3 . in this work",
    "we introduce a tighter bound that is polynomially computable .",
    "we will next describe an intuitive upper bound and later refine it to produce a tighter bound .",
    "our input comprises an mmhg score _ s _ , and the total number of elements _ n_. the output will be an upper bound for the p - value .",
    "the efficiency of our approach relies on enumerating all possible hgt scores rather than enumerating all permutations in @xmath5 .",
    "this approach is computationally efficient as hgt is a function of four input parameters : _",
    "n _ , @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and _ b_. given _",
    "n _ , there are @xmath39 possible combinations of @xmath38 , @xmath3 and _ b_. next , all is left to do is to determine how many permutations stand behind each hgt score . to this end , we will define the function @xmath40 to be the number of permutations for which it holds that out of the first @xmath10 entries , _ b _ of them are taken from the range @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "this formulation is equivalent to counting permutations for which we attain , at some point , the value hgt@xmath42 , had we taken the exhaustive approach .",
    "@xmath40 can be represented as : @xmath43 as we first choose _ b _ elements from the range @xmath41 $ ] to appear at the first @xmath3 entries of the permutation ( there are @xmath44 possibilities ) .",
    "then , we choose where to position these _ b _ elements at the first @xmath3 entries of the permutation and consider all internal arrangements ( for each choice of _ b _ elements there are @xmath45 possibilities ) .",
    "we next choose @xmath46 elements from the range @xmath47 $ ] to appear at the rest of the first @xmath3 entries of the permutation ( there are @xmath48 possibilities for that ) and consider all possible @xmath49 arrangements .",
    "finally , we take into account all possible @xmath50 arrangements of the rest _ n_-@xmath3 entries of the permutation .",
    "a straightforward upper bound for the number of permutations in @xmath5 having mmhg score better than _ s _ follows : @xmath51 this upper bound is simple and requires o@xmath52 hgt calculations .",
    "an hgt calculation takes o(_n _ ) time , assuming binomial coefficients can be calculated in o(1 ) time , for example by using stirling s approximation  @xcite : + @xmath53 , which is tight for large factorials .",
    "the upper bound introduced in the previous section counts the number of permutations for which the value hgt@xmath42 is calculated when taking the non - practical exhaustive approach that enumerates over all _",
    "n _ ! permutations .",
    "ideally , we wish to count the number of permutations for which the value hgt@xmath42 is also their mmhg score , as a permutation may have several hgt values that are better than _ s _ , so it can be counted more than once .",
    "this explains why the formula introduced earlier is an upper bound and not an exact p - value .",
    "a second observation that follows is that the smaller the mmhg score _",
    "s _ is , the tighter the bound , because a permutation will have fewer combinations @xmath42 having hgt score better than _",
    "s_.    therefore , if we can reduce the extent of multiple counting of the same permutation , we will get a tighter bound .",
    "we do this by looking one step backwards .",
    "if , for example , hgt@xmath54 , we can exclude from the counting permutations that contain _ b _ elements from the range @xmath55 $ ] at their first @xmath3 entries because they are already taken into account in @xmath56 ( because necessarily hgt@xmath57 , as we will later explain ) .",
    "let @xmath58 be the set of permutations for which it holds that out of the first @xmath3 entries , _ b _ of them are taken from the range @xmath2 $ ] ( note that @xmath40 introduced earlier is , therefore , the size of @xmath58 ) . assuming hgt@xmath54",
    ", we can partition the set @xmath58 into five disjoint subsets @xmath59 such that @xmath60 , as follows : @xmath61    the properties of the hypergeometric distribution imply that @xmath62 can be disregarded , in the current counting stage . to explain why",
    ", we will demonstrate the argument on @xmath63 .",
    "the permutations in @xmath63 contain _ b _ elements from the range @xmath64 $ ] at the first @xmath3 entries .",
    "we also assume that hgt@xmath65 .",
    "therefore hgt@xmath66 also holds , as the same intersection is observed for even a smaller set .",
    "thus , the permutations in @xmath63 should have been counted when handling the triplet @xmath67 , @xmath3 and _ b _ and disregarded for the combination @xmath38 , @xmath3 and _ b_. similar arguments hold for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 should be counted if it holds that hgt@xmath71 and hgt@xmath72 and hgt@xmath73 , otherwise @xmath70 would have been counted by former triplets .",
    "similarly , @xmath74 should be counted if hgt@xmath75 and hgt@xmath76 and hgt@xmath77 .",
    "finally , we calculate the sizes of @xmath70 and @xmath74 , in the relevant cases . the permutations in @xmath70 contain _",
    "b_-1 elements taken from the range @xmath64 $ ] located at the first @xmath78 entries , where the number @xmath38 is positioned at entry @xmath3 .",
    "therefore : @xmath79 the permutations in @xmath74 contain _",
    "b_-2 elements taken from @xmath64 $ ]",
    "located at the first @xmath78 , where @xmath38 is positioned at one of the first @xmath78 entries , and also entry @xmath3 contains an element from @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "therefore : @xmath80 from the above we next conclude an upper bound . denote @xmath81    @xmath82    yielding the following upper bound for the p - value : @xmath83 note that when @xmath17 or @xmath84 , @xmath85 is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "also , given _",
    "n _ , @xmath38 and @xmath3 , _ b _ can be any integer in @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "this upper bound uses more delicate counting than the bound introduced in the previous section . in the following sections we assess the tightness of this bound . in later sections we demonstrate an application for pwm motif search .",
    "we note that the bound described in steinfeld _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite addresses a slightly different variant of mmhg as a random variable over @xmath5 .",
    "the definition with which we work here is more amenable to deriving tight bounds as described above . given a single permutation @xmath12 and for every @xmath87 , a binary vector @xmath88 is defined in which exactly _ i _ entries are 1 and _ n_-_i _ entries are 0 , as follows : @xmath89 if @xmath90 . the mmhg score of a permutation @xmath1 is then defined by steinfeld _",
    "et al_.  @xcite as : @xmath91 where mhg(@xmath92 ) = @xmath93 @xmath94 a possible upper bound is then given by : @xmath95 computing the latter quantity requires o(@xmath96 ) hgt calculations and is therefore more computationally efficient than the two bounds described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this current work , that require o(@xmath97 ) hgt calculations .",
    "we observed that our bound was tighter than the bound in ( * ) , as later shown in figure 1d .",
    "for example , for a permutation having mmhg score = @xmath98 , our bound was @xmath99 while ( * ) yielded @xmath100 .",
    "for one permutation with mmhg score = @xmath101 , our bound was 0.026 while ( * ) yielded 0.2 .",
    "the latter example demonstrates that a tighter bound is important for classifying an observation as statistically significant ( assuming a significance threshold of 0.05 ) .      in order to assess the quality of our bound , we compared it to the exact p - value , which can be calculated for small values of _ n _ ( that is , in cases where _ n _ ! is not too large ) .",
    "figure 1a compares the mmhg score ( which also serves as a lower bound for the p - value ) , the exact p - value ( calculated by exhaustive enumeration of all 10 !",
    "permutations ) , our upper bound and the bonferroni corrected p - value for _ _ n__=10 .",
    "figure 1b shows the same for _ _ n__=20 , except that exact p - values can not be calculated exhaustively , and therefore an empirical p - value is produced by randomly sampling @xmath102 permutations . in both cases our upper bound is significantly tighter than the bonferroni bound .",
    "we also observed that the smaller the mmhg scores are  the tighter is our bound , consistent with lesser over - counting for smaller scores , as explained in previous sections .",
    "comparison between the first bound described in section 3.1 and the bound described in section 3.2 is shown in figure 1c ( for textit n=20 ) .",
    "we observed that enumerating all hgt scores rather than enumerating all permutations in @xmath5 significantly improves the p - value estimation .",
    "moreover , the refinement of this approach produced by reducing the extent of multiple counting of permutation further improves the upper bound . in figure 1d the bounds , including the bound introduced in section 3.3 ( steinfeld bound ) , are shown for _",
    "_ n__=100 .",
    "an empirical p - value was not calculated here as even if we sample @xmath102 permutations , a p - value smaller than @xmath103 can not be obtained .",
    "the bound suggested in this paper was almost always observed to be tighter than the bound introduced in section 3.3 .      in this section",
    "we discuss mmhg as a framework for assessing the significance of pwm motifs in ranked lists .",
    "given a ranked list of sequences and a pwm motif , by using the mmhg statistics and the bounds introduced earlier , we can assign a p - value to represent the significance of that pwm being enriched at the top of the list . to apply this approach for de - novo motif search , one needs to theoretically consider all possible pwms .",
    "this is not feasible and as a heuristic approach we wrote mmhg - finder which takes as input a ranked list of dna or rna sequences and returns significant motifs in pwm format . in cases where sequence ranking is not relevant or not available",
    ", it allows the use of positive and negative sets of sequences , searching for enriched motifs in the positive set using the negative set as the background .",
    "we will now describe the methodology implemented in mmhg - finder :    * a ranked list of sequences ( or , alternatively , two sets of sequences representing target and background ) * motif width , given as a range between @xmath104 and @xmath105    1 .",
