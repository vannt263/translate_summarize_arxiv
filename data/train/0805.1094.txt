    "since the detection of the first gamma - ray burst ( grb ) in 1967 with detectors aboard the vela satellites @xcite , our understanding of the nature of this still somewhat mysterious phenomenon went through several major advances . in particular , the establishment of their cosmological distances via ground - based follow - up spectroscopy of their afterglow emission ,",
    "first accomplished for grb 970508 @xcite at a redshift of @xmath0 = 0.835 , led to a spectacular world - wide effort to accumulate prompt and afterglow observations which have yielded many surprises and breakthrough discoveries .",
    "one decade after the first afterglow was discovered with bepposax @xcite , the accumulated sample of about 500 grbs exhibits x - ray , optical , and radio afterglows to varying degrees .",
    "their observed redshift distribution is very broad , with more than half of the grbs at distances beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation rate at @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath5 , and with grb 050904 at @xmath0 = 6.29 currently being the most distant burst @xcite .",
    "the association of long - duration grbs with type ib / c supernovae ( see for a review of supernova classification ) , established in a few cases via direct spectroscopy and in a larger sample via a late extra emission component revealed in broad - band photometric observations ( e.g. , ) has thus opened promising observational windows into star formation in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) , cosmic chemical evolution via absorption - line spectroscopy of intervening clouds and host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and may eventually provide valuable constraints on the cosmic re - ionization history in the crucial @xmath6 epoch ( e.g. , ) . every new grb provides yet another opportunity to investigate these topics , or the grb environment via features in the afterglow power - law decay , or to add key data to enable a better understanding of their statistical properties and morphological classification .",
    "here we report on follow - up observations of grb070125 , which was discovered by detectors aboard the ipn members mars odyssey , suzaku , integral , konus - wind , and rhessi at @xmath7 = 07:20:42 ( ut dates and times are used throughout this paper ) on january 25 , 2007 @xcite . the bat detector aboard _ swift _",
    "@xcite recorded the burst during a slew , and therefore did not trigger .",
    "the bat position is consistent with the ipn localization .",
    "the position was monitored with the xrt from 0.54 to 18.5 days after @xmath7 .",
    "we report these observations and their implications ( see also @xcite ) , as well as the results obtained from ground - based follow - up observations with a large group of small , mid - sized , and large - aperture telescopes .",
    "as observed by rhessi , grb 070125 had a duration of @xmath8=63.0 @xmath9 1.7 seconds @xcite , and thus clearly belongs in the class of long-(soft ) grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "details of the prompt emission can be found in @xcite . from a joint fit to the rhessi and konus data , @xcite derived isotropic energies in the 1 kev @xmath10 10 mev band of @xmath11 erg ( konus ) and @xmath12 erg ( rhessi ) .    starting with our early response using the 0.9  m sara telescope and the 2.3  m bok telescope on kitt peak , we compile observations from a large set of follow - up programs to establish the afterglow light - curve properties .",
    "we analyze a diverse set of data with a uniform analysis method to reduce any scatter and establish a well - sampled light curve ( which is usually not possible with data from a single telescope ) .",
    "we obtained keck - i spectra to establish a burst redshift of @xmath0 = 1.547 ( which agrees with the value derived from gemini - north spectroscopy , * ? ? ?",
    "the afterglow initially appeared to have a jet break around day 1.5 , but the analysis presented here shows that at this time multiple rebrightening episodes occur , which are in fact better fit with abrupt jumps in the flux , and not the usual jet - break .",
    "however , the available sparse late - time data do indicate that a break in fact does take place , at @xmath1 3.7 days after the burst , which agrees with the radio light curve at 4.8 ghz presented here , spanning a time range from 1.5 to 278 days after the burst .",
    "we discuss how these observations place grb070125 into the context of other gamma - ray bursts and how the late - time observations may constrain the properties of the underlying host and a potential supernova that is expected to reach its light maximum @xmath1 10(1+@xmath0 ) days after gamma - ray emergence .",
    "emission was detected from this source with the lbt at @xmath13 = 26.8 days @xcite , but the flux is too large to be explained with emission from the commonly assumed sn 1998bw - like template at the burst redshift of 1.547 , and we instead consider the lbt detection to be the afterglow .",
    "this interpretation is supported by a second - epoch lbt observation ( @xmath14 mag ) which did not result in a detection @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath152",
    "we describe our set of observations of grb070125 , from early x - ray and uvot data from _ swift _ to late - time optical observations with the 8.4 m lbt and late - time radio observations with the wsrt . in @xmath153",
    ", we describe the data analysis and results derived from the multi - wavelength data , and in @xmath154 we discuss the implications of this combined data set .",
    "in particular , we discuss grb070125 in the context of the existing data on afterglow emission properties , and we examine the implied burst energies in light of the standard models for long - soft grbs and their interactions with the circumburst medium .",
    "grb070125 was detected at 07:20:42 on january 25 , 2007 , by mars odyssey ( hend and grs ) , suzaku ( wam ) ( @xcite , yamaoka 2008 in prep . ) , integral ( spi - acs ) , konus , and rhessi @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite detected the burst , but did not trigger because _ swift _ was slewing .",
    "the grb entered the coded field of view of the _ swift _ bat 6 minutes after the trigger time , and ground processing revealed a significant source at the intersection of the ipn annuli , strongly reducing the error box . the burst alert telescope ( bat )",

    "about 13 hours later , _",
    "swift _ began observing grb 070125 as a target of opportunity observation .",
    "the afterglow was discovered with the palomar 1.5  m telescope @xcite and produced an accurate afterglow location of @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( @xmath9 0.5@xmath20 in each coordinate ) .",
    "below , we describe space - based observations with instruments on the _ swift _ satellite , as well as ground - based photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : prompt ] shows a false - color image of the field derived from @xmath21 observations with the bok telescope ( described in greater detail below ) .",
    "the afterglow shown in the image within the circle has a brightness of @xmath22 mag at one day after the burst .",
    "the field has a relatively low star density ( galactic coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and has only a little foreground extinction of @xmath25 mag , @xmath26 mag @xcite .",
    "the space - based observations reported in this section consist of ultraviolet , optical , and x - ray data , carried out by the uvot and xrt instruments on @xmath27 beginning 12.97 hours after the burst trigger .",
    "the afterglow was detected in the x - ray band and all six uvot filters , ranging from @xmath28 to uvw2 ( central wavelengths of 546 nm and 193 nm , respectively ) .",
    "although grb070125 was detected by the _",
    "swift_-bat in ground analysis , the bat did not trigger due to the occurrence of the burst during a pre - planned slew phase , and consequently the narrow - field instruments did not obtain prompt observations .",
    "_ swift _ began target of opportunity observations of grb070125 about 13 hours after the trigger at 20:18:48 january 25 , 2007 .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was initially detected by the xrt @xcite in the first few orbits of observation and was followed up for 18.5 days post - trigger until the afterglow was no longer detected by the xrt .",
    "the total exposure time of grb070125 with the xrt was 170 ks .",
    "all observations used the photon counting ( pc ) mode due to the low count rate of the source .",
    "level-1 data products were downloaded from the nasa / gsfc _ swift _ data center ( sdc ) and processed using xrtdas software ( v2.0.1 ) .",
    "the _ xrtpipeline _ task was used to generate level-2 cleaned event files .",
    "only events with pc grades 012 and energies in the range @xmath29 kev were used in subsequent temporal and spectral analysis .",
    "the xrt light curve was created by extracting the counts in a circular region around the afterglow position with a variable radius designed to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) depending on the count rate .",
    "a region with 40 pixels radius clear of serendipitous background sources was used to estimate the contribution of background counts in the source extraction region .",
    "the number of counts per bin was chosen depending on the count rate to show sufficient detail with reasonable error bars .",
    "background - subtracted count rates were also corrected for the portion of the psf excluded by the extraction region and any proximity to bad columns and hot pixels in the xrt ccd .",
    "pile - up is negligible at these flux levels .",
    "we carried out spectral analysis on this data set to obtain a counts - to - flux conversion for the purpose of creating an xrt light curve in standard units .",
    "spectral analysis was carried out using xspec ( v12.3.1 ) and the xrt ancillary response file created with the standard _",
    "xrtmkarf _ task using the response matrix file swxpc0to12s0@xmath3020010101v010.rmf from caldb ( release 2007 - 12 - 04 ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum to a simple absorbed power law with an absorption system at @xmath31 fixed to the galactic hi column density ( @xmath32 , ) , and allowed the absorption at the host - galaxy redshift ( @xmath33 ) to vary .",
    "the resulting fit to the pc spectrum gave an intrinsic effective hydrogen column density of @xmath34 and a photon index of @xmath35 , with a reduced @xmath36 of 0.67 ( 29 degrees of freedom [ d.o.f . ] ) .",
    "the absorption column is in excess of the galactic foreground value , suggesting the possibility that the host galaxy or the circumburst medium contribute somewhat to the observed extinction .",
    "we address this issue below with the x - ray / optical / near - ir afterglow spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the mean absorbed ( un - absorbed ) flux is @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) with a corresponding mean count rate of @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting light curve is shown ( arbitrarily scaled ) in figure 2 .",
    "the uvot @xcite began observing 13 hours after the trigger .",
    "the data were retrieved from the _ swift _ archive at gsfc .",
    "data taken in the uvm2 filter had not all been aspect - corrected , but inspection of the individual images showed that the sources fell within their 3@xmath40 radius region files .",
    "the counts were measured twice , using ximage and uvotmaghist , the latter during testing of the software updates for headas version 6.3 .",
    "the measurements were made for 3@xmath40 and 5@xmath40 radius apertures , both for the transient as well as for four field stars .",
    "following the recommendations in @xcite , an aperture correction was derived based on the observations of field stars having count rates of 110 ct / s , sufficiently low that the point - spread function ( psf ) is not considered to be affected by the uvot coincidence loss .",
    "the calibration of @xcite was used ( caldb update of 2007 - 07 - 11 ) .    since the uvot is a photon - counting instrument ,",
    "subsequent images can be co - added to improve the s / n .",
    "this was done by writing software to co - add the counts until a desired value of s / n was found as well as optimizing the time resolution .",
    "we checked that there was no noticeable difference in co - adding counts before or after doing background subtraction or coincidence - loss corrections , as expected for the low count rates of the transient .",
    "the measurement error of the uvot is binomial due to the finite number of frames in an observation , and the errors were calculated accordingly with the formula given by @xcite .",
    "magnitudes were derived using the new zeropoints of @xcite .",
    "the uvot images of grb070125 were further reduced following the recipe outlined by @xcite , which provided an independent photometric calibration to the @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath28 filters employing a small aperture ( radius of @xmath43 ) for photometry ( thus no need to do aperture correction ) .",
    "comparison between the two reductions indicates that the measurements are consistent with each other within the uncertainties .",
    "the gcn burst notice @xcite was sent out at 21:46:48 jan 25 , approximately 13 hours and 26 minutes after the burst had been detected by the ipn .",
    "the sara 0.9  m telescope on kitt peak began imaging of the field of grb070125 in the @xmath28 band @xmath1 19 hours and 15 minutes after the trigger time , and was closely followed by the 0.41  m prompt telescope on cerro tololo ( 20 hours and 34 minutes ) in @xmath44 and the bok 2.3  m telescope on kitt peak in @xmath28 ( 24 hours ) .",

    "_ swift _ observations began 0.54 days after the burst , followed by ground - based observations beginning 0.8 days by the sara telescope , closely followed by the rest of the various telescopes collected in this collaborative effort . due to a lack of early coverage , it is not immediately clear whether or not there is a jet break .",

    "broken power - law fits to the optical / uv / near - ir data set and the x - ray data set showed that this was indeed a poor model to the data set .",
    "in addition , this fit predicted that the afterglow would have been nearly a magnitude brighter than it was observed to be at 26.8 days .",
    "this would suggest the need for a second , non - standard jet break after 4 days .    by eliminating the flaring region between 1 and 2 days after the trigger",
    ", we can better constrain our fit . however , the best fit was determined by only considering the data taken after 2 days . at this point , it appears as if the flaring has settled to the point where the best estimate for the break time can be made . from the optical / uv / near - ir data set after 2 days , we determine an @xmath67 = 1.56 @xmath9 0.27 , @xmath68 = 2.47 @xmath9 0.13 , and a jet break time of @xmath13 = 3.73 @xmath9 0.52 days .",
    "while the x - ray data do not require a break before 9 days , they are also not inconsistent with a break ( see table  [ tab : lctable ] ) .",

    "the results of all of the fits to the optical / uv / near - ir and x - ray data can be found in table  [ tab : lctable ] .",
    "late - time mdm , lbt , and chandra observations @xcite were invaluable in the determination of a late jet break time , as were the numerous early observations which allowed us to resolve the early flaring activity so as not to be confused with a jet break . while the late mdm upper limit implied an optical jet break , the lbt detection at 26.8 days post - trigger confirmed the existence of a jet break .",
    "second - epoch deep imaging of the field of grb070125 by the lbt did not result in the further detection of the source , thus allowing us to interpret the first detection as the afterglow @xcite .",

    "galactic absorption and extinction were fixed at 4.8 @xmath50 10@xmath97 @xmath70 and @xmath25 mag @xcite , respectively .",

    "a single power - law fit to the x - ray light curve after the flare at @xmath109 seconds results in a temporal index of @xmath110 . for the analysis of the optical temporal slopes",
    "we take the fits without the flares ( see table  [ tab : lctable ] ) , i.e. , @xmath111 before the break and @xmath112 after the break .",
    "the sed fits suggest that there is a cooling break at 0.002 kev ( i.e. in the @xmath45 band ) 4.26 days after trigger .",
    "however , this result should be interpreted with caution , since there is no achromatic light - curve break across the optical bands observed and the @xmath103-band flux is the only one that discriminates between presence or absence of a cooling break in the optical regime . furthermore , the value of @xmath108 one can derive from the spectral slope above the tentative cooling break is @xmath113 , which is not in agreement with the values one obtains from the x - ray temporal slope , @xmath114 , and from the optical temporal slope in the case of a homogeneous circumburst medium , @xmath115 .",
    "if the circumburst medium is structured like a stellar wind , @xmath116 from the optical temporal slope is in agreement with the spectral slope , but the x - ray temporal slope remains inconsistent .",
    "such a discrepancy is not unprecedented ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can derive an interpretation which is consistent with both the spectral and temporal fits ( see below )",
    ".    if one adopts the single power - law fit to the sed , all of the observed bands are either in between , or all of them are above , the peak frequency @xmath117 and cooling frequency @xmath118 .",
    "one then finds that @xmath119 or @xmath120 , respectively .    if one assumes that @xmath121 , @xmath108 is equal to @xmath122 or @xmath123 , for a homogeneous or wind - like medium , respectively ; if @xmath124 , @xmath125 . comparing these values for @xmath108 with the ones from the single power - law sed fit ,",
    "it is clear that they are only consistent for @xmath121 and a homogeneous medium .    the pre - break optical temporal slope results in values for @xmath108 of @xmath126 ( @xmath127 and homogeneous medium ) , @xmath128 ( @xmath127 and stellar - wind medium ) , and @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "comparing these values for @xmath108 with the values from the sed fit , again @xmath127 and a homogeneous medium , which is the preferred situation from the x - ray temporal analysis , is consistent .",
    "concluding , the x - ray to infrared bands at @xmath14 days are situated in between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , with @xmath131 and the circumburst medium is homogeneous .",
    "we note that the @xmath108-value we derive for grb070125 lies at the high end of the observed distribution , and is similar to that measured for e.g. grb980519 ( @xmath108=@xmath132 , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath108-distribution for a subsample of _ bepposax _ grbs is inconsistent with a single value of @xmath108 for all bursts at the 3@xmath55 level , and constrain the intrinsic width of the parent distribution of @xmath108-values to 0.03@xmath1331.40 ( 3@xmath55 ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained for a _ swift _ grb subsample by @xcite .",
    "if we adopt a mean observed @xmath108-value of 2.04 , as measured for the bepposax subsample , then @xmath108=3 lies within the expected observational scatter .      from the light curve ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) , we find evidence for two rebrightening or flaring episodes",
    ". these occur at @xmath13 = 1.15 days ( as observed by the bok telescope , sara , tnt , and kait ) and @xmath13 = 1.36 days ( as observed by tnt and uvot ) .",
    "the episode at @xmath13 = 1.15 days is the best sampled , as illustrated by the bok data in figure  [ fig : lcbok ] . from the @xmath28 band alone ,",
    "we derive a change in magnitude of about 0.5 ( corresponding to a 56% increase in flux ) over a time period of @xmath134  s ( 0.093 days ) , or an average increase in flux density of 17.1 @xmath56jy / hour .",
    "rebrightening episodes are not an uncommon afterglow phenomenon , and have been attributed to a variety of causes , including density fluctuations in the external medium ( clumps , turbulence , or wind - termination shock structures ) , energy injection episodes ( refreshed shocks ) from the catch - up of faster shells in the outflow , patchy shells leading to angular inhomogeneities , extended activity of the central engine , multi - component jets , or , in rare cases , microlensing ; see the recent summary by @xcite for links to the original literature on these options .",
    "@xcite reconsidered the density fluctuation model with detailed numerical simulations , and find that sharp rebrightening episodes with @xmath135 1 can not be explained within this model .",
    "this result is in conflict with earlier conclusions , and the authors argue that their treatment of the reverse shock and photon travel - time effects explain the different outcome of their study .",
    "the rebrightening episodes seen in grb070125 resemble those observed in grb 021004 ( ) , where three episodes with @xmath135 1 are noted at @xmath136 , 0.8 , and 2.6 days .",
    "the preferred interpretation for these episodes is fluctuations in the energy surface density , i.e. , a patchy - shell model ( @xcite ) .",
    "another burst that lends itself to a comparison to grb070125 is the well - sampled `` bumpy - ride '' event grb 030329 .",
    "late - time energy injection ( refreshed shocks ) has been invoked to explain the `` bumps '' in this grb @xcite .",
    "the well - resolved rebrightening episode discussed here is thus not likely caused by density fluctuations in the circumburst medium , but more likely attributed to angular or temporal energy fluctuations .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a detailed analysis of relativistic fireballs with discrete or continuous energy injection , and showed that energy injection imprints significant features on the afterglow , and thus provides a valuable diagnostic tool to study grb fireball physics beyond the single - explosion standard model .",
    "in particular , @xcite find that refreshed shocks from a discrete injection episode at @xmath13 = 1.4 days ( with an energy twice that of the initial energy injection ) may , if not delivered uniformly across the shock surface ( i.e. , if a patchy shell is assumed ) , explain the sharp bump at @xmath13 = 3.5 days observed in grb 000301c .",
    "a more detailed follow - up paper is planned to further explore the rebrightening episodes found in grb070125 .      the wsrt light curve at 4.8 ghz ( see figure  [ wsrt6cmresults ] ) displays the typical radio afterglow light - curve characteristics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "except for the first measurement , all the observations were performed after the jet - break time we derived from the optical light curves . at early times , the radio bands are situated below the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath137 and the peak frequency @xmath117 .",
    "since these two characteristic frequencies move to lower observing frequencies in time , the light curve first rises up to the jet break , after which the flux remains constant .",
    "the measurements at 1.5 and 5.6 days seem to deviate from this behavior , but this can be explained by the effect of radio scintillation @xcite .",
    "the rise in flux after @xmath1  40 days is caused by the passage of @xmath117 through the observing band , and the turnover at @xmath1  90 days by the passage of @xmath137 , after which the light curve declines quite steeply with a temporal index equal to the electron energy power - law index @xmath131 .",
    "more detailed modeling of the radio light curve will be presented in a follow - up paper .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : aftspec ] that the spectrum taken on jan 26 , 2007 at 05:44:05 is nearly featureless .",
    "we have convolved the spectrum with a gaussian matched to the instrumental resolution , and derive a @xmath138 equivalent width limits of approximately 10    at 3100   , 5   at 3200   , 3   at 3400   , 1.5    at 4000   , and 1    redward of 6000   .",
    "we identify only a few features at @xmath138 statistical significance . ]",
    "as listed in table  [ tab : ew ] .",
    "@xcite have reported the detection of a relatively weak doublet ( @xmath139 ) in their afterglow spectrum of grb  070125 , leading to an implied redshift of 1.547 .",
    "our spectra do not confirm this line measurement , but the reported equivalent width lies below our detection threshold .",
    "however , we identify a strong feature at 3947.1    which corresponds to the expected position of the doublet for @xmath140 .",
    "c@xmath141 gas is frequently associated with absorbers @xcite and also gas surrounding grb host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , we lack the spectral resolution to resolve the doublet , but the likelihood of a misidentification is very low given the paucity of absorption lines in our data set .",
    "furthermore , we observe weak absorption at the expected position of the doublet for @xmath140 which is spectrally resolved ( figure  [ fig : aftspec ] ) but has less than @xmath138 statistical significance .",
    "altogether , the spectrum provides strong evidence for a metal - line absorption system at @xmath140 , especially given the independent report of absorption by @xcite . in turn",
    ", we establish this redshift as the lowest possible value for grb070125 .    of principal interest to our study",
    "is whether this metal - line absorption system results from gas in the grb host galaxy and therefore establishes the redshift of grb  070125 .",
    "there are two indisputable signatures that an absorption system corresponds to a grb host galaxy .",
    "( 1 ) one observes fine - structure levels of o@xmath142 , si@xmath143 , or fe@xmath143 . these transitions , which have never been detected in an intervening system with quasar absorption - line spectroscopy , are known to arise from indirect radiative pumping by the grb afterglow .",
    "( 2 ) one positively identifies the ly@xmath95  forest imprint of the intergalactic medium and associates the highest redshift ly@xmath95  absorption with the grb . in this latter case , one frequently observes a damped ly@xmath95  ( dla ) profile . ] at the grb redshift .",
    "our spectrum reveals neither of these two signatures .",
    "first , we note no significant absorption from even the resonance lines of o@xmath142 , si@xmath143 , or fe@xmath143 , and we place relatively stringent upper limits on their equivalent widths ( table  [ tab : ew ] ) .",
    "second , our spectrum does not unambiguously show the ly@xmath95  forest .",
    "figure  [ fig : lya ] presents the spectral region at @xmath144   .",
    "overplotted on the data ( green line ) is a dla profile centered at @xmath140 assuming @xmath145 .",
    "although the data formally reject the presence of a dla system at this redshift , we caution that systematic effects ( wavelength calibration , continuum placement ) are not sufficiently large at @xmath146    to rule out a dla profile at @xmath147  c.l .",
    "the data do , however , rule out a dla profile at all wavelengths greater than 3140   .",
    "the absence of a strong dla system or an obvious series of ly@xmath95  absorption lines ( i.e. , the ly@xmath95  forest ) places an upper limit on the redshift of grb  070125 .",
    "a reasonable estimate is to designate the absorption line ( presently unidentified ) at @xmath148    as a ly@xmath95  transition and set @xmath149 .",
    "the identification of this feature as ly@xmath95   is not supported by any coincident metal - line absorption ( e.g. , ) .",
    "furthermore , the implied rest equivalent width , @xmath150 , would be significantly lower than any thus far reported for gas surrounding a grb .",
    "nevertheless , we can not rule out this interpretation altogether .",
    "applying occam s razor to our full set of observations , we associate the metal - line absorption system at @xmath140 with the host galaxy of grb  070125 . to date , every absorption system which has been unambiguously associated with a grb host galaxy ( i.e. ,  using the criteria above ) has shown strong ly@xmath95 , , and absorption . in fact , this afterglow spectrum would already represent the weakest doublet ever reported , although weaker equivalent widths exist @xcite .    whether or not we associate the @xmath140 metal - line system with grb  070125 , this afterglow spectrum is remarkable in several respects .",
    "first , it is evident that the column density is low .",
    "taking @xmath151 , we have argued that the data prefer @xmath152 , which is a rare but not unprecedented result @xcite .",
    "if @xmath153 , then the ly@xmath95  transition has the lowest equivalent width reported for a grb .",
    "either way , the low @xmath154  value is remarkable given the expectation that the grb progenitor arises in a high density , star - forming region .",
    "similar cases are discussed in @xcite .",
    "second , even taking @xmath155 the , , and other low - ion equivalent widths are among the lowest observed to date for gas surrounding a grb .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to estimate the gas metallicity without a meaningful constraint on the @xmath154  value . adopting @xmath156 ,",
    "the upper limit to the equivalent width of @xmath1572796 implies a mg / h ratio less than 1/10 the solar value .",
    "we derive a similar value adopting the upper limit to the equivalent width of  1526 ( @xmath158",
    " ) and assuming the metallicity/@xmath159 relation of @xcite .    taking both the spectroscopy and sed results into consideration , the host - galaxy properties of grb070125 are consistent with those found in the sample presented by @xcite .",
    "while we do not have data before 0.545 days ( the first exposures were obtained in @xmath28 with the uvot ) , sampling thereafter is reasonably dense in time ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) , until about 4 days after @xmath7 .",
    "these observations suggest a possible jet break in the 13 day window .",
    "however , the strong variability ( rebrightening episodes ) around @xmath160 12 days interferes with a clean detection of the jet break , and it is conceivable that the actual afterglow light curve is not best represented by a broken power law ( the beuermann - like profile ) with superimposed `` flares , '' but instead by three or more power laws , interrupted and perhaps re - established by several periods of rebrightening .",
    "grb 030329 provides an example of a grb with a jet break at @xmath161 days ( @xcite ) , followed by multiple rebrightening episodes during subsequent days ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given that the light curve of grb070125 exhibits strong variability , a jet - break interpretation requires extreme care .",
    "however , the sparse late - time data do suggest that a break has occurred . fitting the data past 2 days",
    "indicates that the actual jet break is more likely to be identified with the required change in slope at @xmath13 = 3.7 days .",
    "if there indeed was no very early break in the optical power - law decay ( before 0.5 days ) and this late break time established from our fits is to be identified with the jet break , the indicated jet half - opening angle of @xmath162 implies @xmath163 erg ( from @xmath164 ) , and grb070125 is consistent with the ghirlanda relation @xcite .",
    "the redshift allows us to place grb070125 in general context .",
    "figure  [ fig : big2 ] shows the intrinsic afterglow of grb070125 in comparison with 52 other afterglows from the samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these afterglows are in the @xmath45 band and have been corrected for galactic extinction and , where possible , for host galaxy and supernova contributions .",
    "the afterglow of grb070125 was constructed by shifting @xmath165 data to the @xmath45 band , as only @xmath166 data are available at early times . using the method described by @xcite ,",
    "all afterglows have been corrected for rest - frame extinction and shifted to a common redshift of 1 , allowing a direct comparison .",
    "the afterglow of grb070125 is found to be among the most luminous afterglows ; at the time of the rebrightening at one day , only the afterglow of grb 021004 is brighter .",
    "the afterglow properties thus corroborate the inferences we made in the previous section , where the beaming - corrected burst energy in the 110,000 kev regime @xcite was found to be on the high side of the observed statistical distribution .",
    "had grb070125 been much nearer , it would have given us an unprecedented opportunity to observe an afterglow on a much longer time scale , detect the additional emissions from an associated supernova , and possibly revealed a host galaxy . at a redshift of 1.547 , an unextinguished sn 1998bw would have peaked at @xmath167 mag about one month after the burst .",
    "the lbt detection at late times could be explained with a supernova like sn 1998bw , if one allows a scaling factor of @xmath168 = 2.25 , which is significantly larger than indicated by the properties of the sample of established grb - supernovae ( ) . additionally , assuming that the late - time detection is composed entirely of supernova emission implies an even steeper afterglow decay .",
    "given the uncertainties when extrapolating the light - curve properties of sn 1998bw to a redshift of 1.5 , we caution that this factor has a large uncertainty .",
    "based on what is known so far about the luminosities of grb - sne ( ) , it seems unlikely that the lbt data point is indeed representing sn light .",
    "another alternative is light from an underlying host galaxy ( not discernible in the images ) . due to the second - epoch non - detection by the lbt @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that the host galaxy must be fainter than @xmath169 mag ( @xmath14 mag ) , which is comparable to the magellanic clouds or even fainter @xcite , but consistent with the distribution found in the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "survey by @xcite .",
    "the low metallicity we inferred from the spectra would also be consistent with a small , low - luminosity host galaxy .",
    "grb070125 was unusual in several aspects .",
    "it had at least two sharp rebrightening episodes , it was intrinsically bright , and did not reveal the often associated dla and mg  ii features in its smooth spectrum .",
    "the collective efforts of a large group allowed us to learn much about this burst , but it also provides a good example of the all - too - common situation that the world resources are too scarce to follow every burst with the kind of intensity in time and bandpass that may be required to extract enough information about each burst .",
    "bumps have to be resolved , light curves need to be followed over longer time scales with greater sampling frequency , seds need to be established at many epochs , the associated supernovae should be checked even if the redshift is large , and host - galaxy properties should be established .",
    "global coverage is necessary so that bumps and jet breaks are not missed , especially if future mission , such as exist @xcite , may result in much higher burst rates .",
