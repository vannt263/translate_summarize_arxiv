    "in the physics literature , stochastic particle systems in a limit of large system size are often described by a mean - field master equation for the time evolution of a single lattice site @xcite . for conservative systems , these equations are very similar to mean - field rate equations in the study of cluster growth models ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we focus on particle systems where only one particle jumps at a time , which corresponds to monomer exchange in cluster growth models as studied in @xcite , and also in the well - known becker - dring model @xcite .",
    "while these mean - field equations often provide the starting point for the analysis and have an intuitive form , to our knowledge their connection to underlying particle systems has not been rigorously established so far .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a rigorous derivation of this equation for misanthrope - type processes @xcite with bounded jump rates and homogeneous initial conditions on a complete graph .",
    "the limit equation describes the dynamics of the fraction @xmath0 $ ] of lattice sites with a given occupation number @xmath1 , and also provides the master equation of a birth death chain for the limiting single site dynamics of the process .",
    "note that no time rescaling is required and the limiting dynamics are non - linear , i.e. the birth and death rates of the chain depend on the distribution @xmath2 . even though the limiting birth death dynamics is irreducible under non - degenerate initial conditions , the non - linearity leads to conservation of the first moment of the initial distribution , resulting in a continuous family of stationary distributions , as has been observed before for other non - linear birth death chains ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . to establish the mean - field property in the limit",
    ", we show the asymptotic decay of correlations by bounding percolation clusters in the graphical construction of the process with branching processes up to finite times , similar to @xcite .",
    "existence of limits follows from standard tightness arguments , and our proof also includes a simple uniqueness argument for solutions of the limit equation . while uniqueness has been establish for more complicated coagulation fragmentation models @xcite , we could not find a result covering our case in the literature .    under certain conditions on the jump rates , stochastic particle systems can exhibit a condensation transition where a non - zero fraction of all particles accumulates in a condensate , provided the particle density exceeds a critical value @xmath3 .",
    "condensing models with homogeneous stationary product measures have attracted significant research interest ( see e.g. @xcite for recent summaries ) , including zero - range processes of the type introduced in @xcite , inclusion processes with a rescaled system parameter @xcite and explosive condensation models @xcite . while the stationary measures have been understood in great detail on a rigorous level @xcite",
    ", the dynamics of these processes continue to pose interesting mathematical questions .",
    "first recent results for zero - range and inclusion processes have been obtained on metastability in the stationary dynamics of the condensate location @xcite , approach to stationarity on fixed lattices under diverging particle density @xcite , and a hydrodynamic limit for density profiles below the critical value @xcite .",
    "our result provides a contribution towards a rigorous understanding of the approach to stationarity in the thermodynamic limit of diverging system size and particle number .",
    "this exhibits an interesting coarsening regime characterized by a power - law time evolution of typical observables , which has been identified in previous heuristic results @xcite also on finite dimensional regular lattices .",
    "condensation implies that stationary measures for the limiting birth death dynamics only exist up to a first moment @xmath3 , above which @xmath2 phase separates over time into two parts describing the mass distribution in the condensate and the background of the underlying particle system .",
    "explicit travelling wave scaling solutions for the condensed part of the distribution have been found in @xcite for zero - range processes and in @xcite for a specific inclusion process , and will be discussed in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : notation ] we introduce notation and state our main result with the proof given in section [ sec : proof ] . in section [ sec : properties ] we discuss basic properties of the limit dynamics and its solutions , as well as limitations and possible extensions of our result .",
