    "much of the recent research on the structure of networks of various kinds has looked at properties like path lengths , transitivity , degree distributions , and resilience of networks to vertex deletion  @xcite , all of which , while of exceptional importance in many contexts , tend to focus our attention on the properties of individual vertices or vertex pairs  how far apart they are , what their degrees are , and so forth .",
    "however , in other contexts it may be equally important to ask about the large - scale properties of the network as a whole . numbers of components and their distribution of sizes would be an example of such a property , one which is relevant to issues of accessibility  @xcite and to epidemiology  @xcite .",
    "searchability and the performance of search algorithms on networks would be another  @xcite . a third is the existence and effects of large - scale inhomogeneity in networks  what we call `` community structure '' , the presence ( or absence ) in the network of regions with high densities of connections between vertices and other regions with low densities  and",
    "it is with a discussion of this topic that we begin this paper .",
    "( in some circles , this phenomenon is called `` clustering '' , an unfortunate terminology which risks confusion with another use of the word clustering introduced recently by watts and strogatz  @xcite .",
    "we will use the word clustering only in reference to hierarchical clustering , which is a standard technique for community detection ; otherwise we will avoid it . ) our investigation of community structure will lead us to consideration of mixing patterns in networks  which vertices connect to which others and why  as an explanation for observed communities in networks of all kinds , and eventually to consideration of more general classes of correlated networks including networks with correlations between the degrees of adjacent vertices .    much of the work reported in this article has appeared previously in various papers , which the reader may like to consult for more detail than we can give here  @xcite .",
    "the oldest studies by far of the large - scale statistical properties of networks are the studies of social networks carried out within the sociological community , which stretch back at least to the 1930s  @xcite .",
    "social networks are network representations of relationships of some kind , generically called `` ties '' , between people or groups of people , generically called `` actors '' .",
    "actors might be individuals , organizations or companies , while ties might represent friendship , acquaintance , business relationships or financial transactions , amongst other things .",
    "5.2 cm    a long - standing goal among social network analysts has been to find ways of analysing network data to reveal the structure of the underlying communities that they represent . it is commonly supposed that the actors in most social networks divide themselves naturally into groups of some kind , such that the density of ties within groups is higher than the density of ties between them . a sketch of a network with such community structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] .",
    "it is a matter of common experience that social networks do contain communities .",
    "we look around ourselves and see that we belong to this clique or that , that we have a circle of close friends and others whom we know less well , that there are groupings within our personal networks on the basis of interest , occupation , geographical location and so forth .",
    "this does not however guarantee that a network contains community structure of type that we are considering here .",
    "it would be perfectly possible for each person in a network to have a well - defined set of close acquaintances , their own personal network neighbourhood , but for the network neighbourhoods of different people to overlap only partially , so that the network as a whole is quite homogeneous , with no clear communities emerging from the pattern of vertices and edges .",
    "a network model showing precisely this type of structure has been proposed and studied recently by kleinberg  @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this section will be to investigate methods for detecting whether true community structure does exist in networks and for extracting the communities , and to apply those methods to particular networks .",
    "as we will see , the early intuition of the sociologists was correct , and many of the networks studied , including non - social networks , do possess large - scale inhomogeneity of precisely the type that would indicate the presence of community divisions .",
    "the problem then is to take a network , specified in the simplest case by a list of @xmath0 vertices joined in pairs by @xmath1 edges , and from this structure to extract a set of communities  non - overlapping subsets of vertices that are , in some sense , tightly knit , having stronger within - group connections than between - group connections .",
    "the traditional , and still most common , method for detecting structure of this kind is the method of `` hierarchical clustering ''  @xcite . in this method",
    "one defines a connection strength for each pair of vertices in the network , i.e. ,  @xmath2 numbers that represent a distance or weight for the connection between each pair .",
    "( in some versions of the method not all pairs are assigned a connection strength , in which case those that are not can be assumed to have a connection strength of zero . ) examples of possible definitions for the strengths include geodesic ( shortest path ) distances between pairs , or their inverses if one wants a measure that increases when pairs are more closely connected , counts of numbers of vertex- or edge - independent paths between pairs ( `` maxflow '' methods ) or weighted counts of total numbers of paths between pairs ( adjacency matrix methods )",
    ".    6.3 cm    then , starting with the @xmath0 vertices but no edges between them , one joins vertices together in decreasing order of the weights of vertex pairs , ignoring the edges of the original network .",
    "one can pause at any stage in this process and observe the pattern of components formed by the connections added so far , which are taken to be the communities of the network at that stage .",
    "the heirarchical clustering method thus defines not just a single decomposition of the network into communities , but a nested hierarchy of possible decompositions , having varying numbers of communities .",
    "this hierarchy can be represented as a tree or `` dendrogram '' , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ dendrogram ] . a horizontal cut through the dendrogram at any given height , such as that denoted by the dotted line in fig .  [ dendrogram ] , splits the tree into the communities for the corresponding stage in the hierarchical clustering process . by varying the height of the cut",
    ", one can arrange for the number of communities to take any desired value .",
    "the construction of dendrograms is a popular technique for the analysis of network data , particularly within the sociological community .",
    "software packages for network analysis , such as pajek and ucinet , incorporate hierarchical clustering as a standard feature : for any network one can calculate a huge variety of vertex ",
    "vertex weights of different types and construct the corresponding dendrogram for any of them .",
    "the method however has some problems .",
    "there are many cases in which networks have rather obvious community structure , but hierarchical clustering fails to find it .",
    "one particular pathology that is frequently observed is that peripheral vertices tend to get disconnected from the bulk of the network , rather than being associated with the groups or communities that they are primarily attached to .",
    "for example , if a vertex is connected to the rest of the network by only a single edge , then presumably , were one to assign it to a community , it would be assigned to the community that the single edge leads to . in many cases ,",
    "however , the hierarchical clustering method will declare the vertex instead to be a single - vertex community in its own right , in disagreement with our intuitive ideas of community structure .",
    "in a recent paper therefore  @xcite we have proposed an alternative method for detecting community structure , based on calculations of so - called edge betweenness for vertex pairs . as we will see , this method detects the known community structure in a number of networks with remarkable accuracy .",
    "freeman  @xcite proposed a measure of centrality for the actors in a social network which he called `` betweenness '' .",
    "the betweenness of an actor is defined to be the number of shortest paths between pairs of vertices that pass through that actor . in cases where the number @xmath3 of shortest paths between a vertex pair is greater than one ,",
    "each path is given an equal weight of  @xmath4 .",
    "trivial algorithms for calculating betweenness take @xmath5 time to calculate betweenness for all vertices , or @xmath6 time on a sparse graph ( i.e. ,  one in which the number of edges per vertex is constant in the limit of large graph size ) .",
    "this makes the calculation prohibitively costly on large networks .",
    "recently however , two new algorithms have been proposed  @xcite that both allow the same calculation to be performed faster , in time @xmath7 , or @xmath8 on a sparse graph , by eliminating needless recalculations of geodesic paths .",
    "the betweenness of a vertex gives an indication , as the name implies , of how much the vertex is `` between '' other vertices .",
    "if , for example , information ( or anything else ) spreads through a network primarily by following shortest paths , then betweenness scores will indicate through which vertices most information will flow on average .",
    "the vertices with highest betweenness are also those whose removal will result in an increase to the geodesic distance between the largest number of other vertex pairs .    here",
    "we consider an extension of freeman s betweenness to the edges in a network .",
    "the betweenness of an edge is defined to be the number of shortest paths between pairs of vertices that run along that edge , with paths again being given weights @xmath4 when there are @xmath9 between a given pair of vertices .",
    "in fact , the concept of edge betweenness actually appears to predate freeman s work on vertex betweenness , having appeared in an obscure technical report by an amsterdam mathematician some years earlier  @xcite .",
    "edge betweenness has received very little attention in other literature until recently , but it provides us with an excellent measure of which edges in a network lie between different communities . in a network with strong community structure  groups of vertices with only a few inter - group edges joining them  at least some of the inter - group edges will necessarily receive high edge betweenness scores , since they must carry the geodesic paths between vertex pairs that lie in different communities .",
    "this implies that eliminating edges with high edge betweenness from a graph will remove the inter - group edges , and hence split the graph efficiently into its different groups .",
    "this is the principle behind our method for the detection of community structure .",
    "our algorithm is as follows .    1 .",
    "we calculate the edge betweenness of every edge in the network .",
    "2 .   we remove the edge with the highest betweenness score , or randomly choose one such if more than one edge ties for the honour .",
    "we recalculate betweenness scores on the resulting network and repeat from step  2 until no edges remain .",
    "the recalculation in step  3 is crucial to the method s success .",
    "when there is more than one inter - group edge between two groups of vertices , there is no guarantee that both will receive high betweenness scores ; in some cases most geodesic paths will flow along one edge and only that one will receive a high score .",
    "recalculation ensures that at some stage in the working of the algorithm each inter - group edge receives a high score and thus gets removed .",
    "the calculation of all edge betweennesses takes time @xmath7 , and its repetition for all @xmath1 edges thus gives the algorithm a worst - case running time of  @xmath10 , or @xmath6 on a sparse graph .",
    "the results of the algorithm can be represented as a dendrogram , just as in traditional hierarchical clustering , although one should be aware that the construction of the tree is not logically the same : the recalculation of the betweennesses after each edge removal means that there is no single function that can be defined for each edge in the initial graph such that the resulting dendrogram is the representation of a hierarchical clustering construction carried out using that function .      here",
    "we give three examples of the application of our community structure finding algorithm to different networks .",
    "the first example is a set of computer generated graphs , specifically created to test the algorithm .",
    "we created a large number of graphs of 128 vertices each , divided into four groups of 32 vertices .",
    "edges were placed at random between vertices within the same group with probability  @xmath11 and between vertices in different groups with probability @xmath12 , with the values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 chosen to make the average degree of a vertex equal to  16 , and @xmath14 .",
    "these graphs were then fed into our community structure algorithm , and we measured what fraction of the vertices were correctly classified into their communities as a function of the ratio of @xmath11 to @xmath12 , or equivalently the mean number @xmath15 of edges from a vertex to vertices in other communities . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ randtest ] .",
    "as the figure shows , the algorithm performs almost perfectly for values of @xmath15 up to about 6 . beyond this point , as @xmath15 approaches the value of  8 at which each vertex has as many inter - group edges as intra - group ones , the fraction of successfully classified vertices falls off sharply .    on the same plot",
    "we also show the performance of a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm based on edge - independent path counts ( maxflow ) on the same set of random graphs .",
    "as the figure shows , the traditional method is far inferior to our new algorithm in finding the known community structure .    for our second example",
    ", we move to real - world network data . in 1977",
    ", wayne zachary published the results of an ethnographic study he had conducted of social interactions between 34 members of a karate club at an american university  @xcite .",
    "he recorded social contacts between members of the club over a two year period and published his results in the form of social networks .",
    "fortuitously there arose , during the course of the study , a dispute between the two leaders of the club , the karate teacher and the club s president , over whether to raise the club s fees . ultimately , the dispute resulted in the departure of the karate teacher and his starting another club of his own , taking with him about a half of the original club s members . here",
    "we analyse a network constructed by zachary of friendships between club members before the split occurred .",
    "we compare the predictions of our community - finding algorithm applied to this network with the known lines along which the club divided .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ zachary ] .    in panel",
    "( a ) of the figure we show the original network , with the grey squares representing the faction that ultimately sided with the teacher ( who is vertex number  1 ) , and the open circles the faction that sided with the club s president ( vertex number  34 ) . in panel",
    "( b ) we show the dendrogram output by our algorithm for this network .",
    "as the figure shows , the algorithm again performs nearly perfectly , with only one vertex , vertex number  3 , being misclassified .",
    "( inspection of panel  ( a ) reveals that vertex  3 is in fact precisely caught in the middle of the network between the two factions , and so it is not entirely surprising that this vertex was misclassified . ) bear in mind that the network in this example was recorded _ before _ the fission of the club , so that the results of panel  ( b ) are in some sense a prediction of events that were , at that time , yet to occur .",
    "finally , for our third example , we take a network for which we do not have any strong presuppositions about a `` correct '' division into communities .",
    "this example is a true experiment to see what information the algorithm can give us about a network whose structure is not wholly understood .",
    "the network in question is a food web , the web of trophic interactions ( who eats whom ) of marine organisms living in the chesapeake bay .",
    "the network was assembled by baird and ulanowicz  @xcite and contains 33 vertices representing the ecosystem s most prominent taxa .",
    "the edges in a food web are , technically , directed ; they can be thought of as pointing from prey to their predators , thus indicating the direction of energy ( or carbon ) flow up the food chain .",
    "here however we have ignored the directed nature of the network , considering the edges merely to be undirected indicators of trophic interaction between taxon pairs .",
    "the dendrogram produced for this food web by our community structure algorithm is shown in fig .",
    "[ foodweb ] .",
    "as we can see , the algorithm splits the network into two principle communities and a couple of smaller peripheral ones .",
    "we have shaded the vertices in the dendrogram to show which taxa are surface dwellers in the bay ( pelagic species ) and which bottom dwellers ( benthic species ) .",
    "a few species are of undetermined status .",
    "it is clear that our algorithm has in this case primarily extracted from the network the distinction between pelagic and benthic taxa .",
    "thus our results appear to imply that the food web in question can be split roughly into separate surface- and bottom - dwelling subsystems , with relatively weak interaction between the two .",
    "a small number of benthic species are found to belong more strongly to the pelagic community than to the benthic one , perhaps indicating that a simple classification of species by where they live is not telling the whole story for this system .",
    "the results of our analysis might also be helpful in assigning a type to the undetermined species in the network .",
    "there is certainly more than one possible explanation for the presence of community structure in a network , and different explanations may be appropriate to different networks .",
    "in the case of a social network , for example , jin  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that communities can arise as a result of the growth dynamics of a network .",
    "if an acquaintance network grows by the introduction of pairs of people to one another by a mutual acquaintance , then an initial chance acquaintance with a member of a certain community will lead to introductions to other members of that community , so that one ultimately becomes linked to many of the community s members and so becomes a member oneself . using a simple computer model of this process , jin  _ et  al .",
    "_  found that even networks with no initial community structure quickly develop such structure over time .",
    "one can think of this as a mechanism for the development of cliquishness in social networks .",
    "this mechanism however is quite specific to social networks and could not be easily applied , for example , to the food web studied in the last section .",
    "it also completely ignores any personal attributes of the actors involved or affinities between actor pairs .",
    "a more general and perhaps more convincing explanation for community formation , which takes these things into account , is that of assortative mixing , which is the tendency for nodes in a network to form connections preferentially to others that are like them in some way .",

    "table [ sanfran ] shows data from the aids in multiethnic neighborhoods study  @xcite , on mixing by race among sexual partners in the city of san francisco , california .",
    "this part of the study focused on heterosexual partnerships , and the rows and columns of the matrix represent men and women in such partnerships , grouped by their ( self - identified ) race . diagonal elements of the matrix represent the fraction of survey respondents in partnerships with members of their own group , and off - diagonal those in partnerships with members of other groups .",
    "inspection of the figures shows that the matrix has considerably more weight along its diagonal than off it , indicating that assortative mixing does take place in this network .",
    "one might well expect mixing of this type to result in divisions within the community along lines of race , and we will show shortly that , within the context of simulations of network formation , assortative mixing can indeed give rise to community structure .    the amount of assortative mixing in a network can be characterized by measuring how much of the weight in the mixing matrix falls on the diagonal , and how much off it .",
    "let us define @xmath17 to be the fraction of all edges in a network that join a vertex of type  @xmath18 to a vertex of type  @xmath19 . in the case of the matrix of table  [ sanfran ] , where the ends of an edge always attach to one man and one woman ,",
    "we also specify which index corresponds to which type of end , which makes @xmath17 asymmetric .",
    "for example , we could specify that the first index  @xmath18 represents the man and the second  @xmath19 the woman . for networks",
    "in which there is no corresponding distinction , @xmath17  will be symmetric .",
    "the matrix should also satisfy the sum rules @xmath20 where @xmath16 and @xmath21 are the fraction of each type of end of an edge that is attached to vertices of type  @xmath18 .",
    "the values of @xmath16 and @xmath21 for the san francisco study are also shown in table  [ sanfran ] . on graphs where there is no distinction between the ends of edges",
    ", we will have @xmath22 .",
    "now we can define a quantitative measure  @xmath23 of the level of assortative mixing in the network thus  @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matrix whose elements are the  @xmath17 , and the notation @xmath26 indicates the sum of the elements of the matrix  @xmath27 .",
    "we call the quantity  @xmath23 the `` assortativity coefficient '' .",
    "it takes the value  1 in a perfectly assortative network , since in that case the entire weight of the matrix  @xmath25 lies along its diagonal and @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , if there is no assortative mixing at all , then @xmath29 for all @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "networks can also be disassortative : vertices may associate preferentially with others of different types  the `` opposites attract '' phenomenon . in that case , @xmath23  will take a negative value .",
    "one can certainly imagine that assortative mixing might apply in other types of networks as well .",
    "for example , we saw in section  [ examples ] that a food web of marine organisms apparently divided into communities along lines of location  which species were surface dwellers ( pelagic ) and which bottom dwellers ( benthic ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the evolution of new predatory relationships between species is biased by the location of those species living quarters , and hence that the network structure would indeed reflect the pelagic / benthic division as a result of assortative mixing by location .",
    "we can test our hypothesis that assortative mixing could be responsible for community formation in networks by computer simulation . given a mixing matrix of the type shown in table  [ sanfran ] , we can create a random network with the corresponding mixing pattern and any desired degree distribution by the following algorithm .    1 .",
    "first we choose degree distributions @xmath32 for each vertex type  @xmath18 .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 here denotes the probability that a randomly chosen vertex of type  @xmath18 will have degree  @xmath33 .",
    "we can also calculate the mean degree @xmath34 for each vertex type .",
    "next we choose a size for our graph in terms of the number @xmath1 of edges and draw @xmath1 edges from the desired distribution @xmath17 .",
    "we count the number of ends of edges of each type  @xmath18 , to give the sums  @xmath35 of the degrees of vertices in each class , and we calculate the expected number  @xmath36 of vertices of each type from @xmath37 ( rounded to the nearest integer ) .",
    "3 .   we draw @xmath36 vertices from the desired degree distribution  @xmath32 for type  @xmath18 .",
    "normally the degrees of these vertices will not sum exactly to  @xmath35 as we want them to , in which case we choose one vertex at random , discard it , and draw another from the distribution  @xmath32 , repeating until the sum does equal  @xmath35 .",
    "we pair up the @xmath35 ends of edges of type  @xmath18 at random with the vertices we have generated , so that each vertex has the number of attached edges corresponding to its chosen degree .",
    "we repeat from step  3 for each vertex type .",
    "we have used this algorithm to generate example networks with desired levels of assortative mixing .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fourway ] shows an undirected network of @xmath38 vertices of four different types , generated using the symmetric mixing matrix @xmath39 which gives a value of @xmath40 for the assortativity coefficient . a simple poisson degree distribution with mean  @xmath41 was used for all vertex types .",
    "the graph was then fed into the community finding algorithm of section  [ gn ] and a cut through the resulting dendrogram performed at the four - community level .",
    "the communities found are shown by the four shapes of vertices in the figure and correspond very closely to the real vertex type designations , which are represented by the four different vertex shades .",
    "in other words , by introducing assortative mixing by vertex type into this network , we have created vertex - type communities that register in our community finding algorithm in exactly the same way as communities in naturally occurring networks .",
    "this strongly suggests that assortative mixing could indeed be an explanation for the occurrence of such communities , although it is worth repeating that other explanations are also possible .",
    "assortative mixing can depend on vertex properties other than the simple enumerative properties discussed in the preceding section .",
    "for example , we can also have assortative mixing by scalar characteristics , either discrete or continuous .",
    "a classic example of such mixing , much studied in the sociological literature , is acquaintance matching by age . in many contexts ,",
    "people appear to prefer to associate with others of approximately the same age as themselves .",
    "for example , consider fig .  [ marriage ] , which shows the ages at marriage of the male and female members of 1141 married couples drawn from the us national survey of family growth  @xcite .",
    "each point in the figure represents one couple , its position along the horizontal and vertical axes corresponding to the ages of the husband and wife respectively .",
    "the study was based on interviews with women , and was limited to those of childbearing age , so the vertical axis cuts off around  40 .",
    "also only the first marriage for each woman interviewed is shown , even if she married more than once . despite these biases",
    "however , the figure reveals a clear trend : people prefer to marry others of an age close to their own .",
    "it is perhaps stretching a point a little to consider first marriage ties between couples as forming a social network , since people have at most one first marriage and hence would have a maximum degree of one within the network . here , however , we consider marriage age as a proxy for the ages of sexual partners in general , and conjecture that a similar age preference will be seen in non - married partners also . a recent study by garfinkel  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite appears to support this conjecture .",
    "assortative mixing according to scalar characteristics can result in the formation of communities , just as in the case of discrete characteristics .",
    "one could have separate communities formed of old and young people , for instance .",
    "however , it is also possible that we do not get well - defined communities , but instead get an overlapping set of groups with no clear boundaries , ranging for example from low age to high age . in the sociological literature such a continuous gradation of one community into another",
    "is called `` stratification '' of the network .    as with assortative mixing on discrete characteristics , one can define an assortativity coefficient to quantify the extent to which mixing",
    "is biased according to scalar vertex properties . to do this",
    ", we define @xmath42 to be the fraction of edges in our network that connect a vertex of property  @xmath43 to another of property  @xmath44 .",
    "the matrix @xmath42 must satisfy sum rules as before , of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the fraction of edges that start and end at vertices with ages  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 . then the appropriate definition for the assortativity coefficient is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the standard deviations of the distributions @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ". the reader will no doubt recognize this definition of @xmath23 as the standard pearson correlation coefficient for the quantities @xmath43 and  @xmath44 .",
    "it takes values in the range @xmath51 with @xmath52 indicating perfect assortative mixing , @xmath31 indicating no correlation between @xmath43 and  @xmath44 , and @xmath53 indicating perfect disassortative mixing , i.e. ,  perfect anticorrelation between @xmath43 and  @xmath44 .    if we take the marriage data from fig .",
    "[ marriage ] , for example , and feed it into eq .",
    "( [ rscalar ] ) , we find that @xmath54 , indicating once again that mixing is strongly assortative ( as is in any case obvious from the figure ) .",
    "mixing could also depend on vector or even tensor characteristics of vertices .",
    "one example would be mixing by geographical location , which could be regarded as a two - vector .",
    "it seems highly likely that if one were to record both acquaintance patterns and geographical location for actors in a social network , one would discover that acquaintance is strongly dependent on geography , with people being more likely to know others who live in the same part of the world as themselves",
    ".      we will spend the rest of this article examining one particular case of mixing according to a scalar vertex property , that of mixing by vertex degree , which has been studied for some time in the social networks literature and has recently attracted attention in the mathematical and physical literature also .",
    "krapivsky and redner  @xcite for instance found in studies of the preferential attachment model of barabsi and albert  @xcite that edges did not fall between vertices independent of their degrees .",
    "instead there was a higher probability to find some degree combinations at the ends of edges than others .",
    "pastor - satorras  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite showed for data on the structure of the internet at the level of autonomous systems that the degrees of adjacent vertices were anticorrelated , i.e. ,  that high - degree vertices prefer to attach to low - degree vertices , rather than other high - degree ones  the network is disassortative by degree . to demonstrate this",

    "it is not clear at present why this should be , although explanations for the observed mixing behaviours have been proposed in some specific cases  @xcite .    as with the mixing by discrete enumerative characteristics discussed in section  [ origins ]",
    ", we can also investigate the effects of assortative mixing by looking at computer generated networks with particular types of mixing .",

    "we get various values of the assortativity  @xmath23 , both positive and negative , passing through zero at @xmath102    as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ graphs ] the giant components of two graphs of this type generated using the monte carlo method .",
    "one of them , graph  ( a ) , is assortatively mixed by degree , while the other , graph  ( b ) , is disassortatively mixed .",
    "the difference between the two is clear to the eye . in the first case , because the high degree vertices prefer to attach to one another , there is a central `` core '' to the network , composed of these high - degree vertices , and a straggling periphery of low - degree vertices around it . in epidemiology a dense central portion of this type",
    "is called a `` core group '' and is thought to be capable of acting as a reservoir for disease , keeping diseases circulating even when the density of the network as a whole is too low to maintain endemic infection . in social network analysis one also talks of `` core / periphery '' distinctions in networks , another concept that mirrors what we see here . in the second graph , which is disassortative ,",
    "a contrasting picture is evident : the high - degree vertices prefer not to associate with one another , and are as a result scattered widely over the network , producing a more uniform appearance .",
    "to shed more light on the effects of assortativity , we show in fig .",
    "[ gc ] the size of the largest component in networks of this type as the degree distribution parameter @xmath103 is varied , for various values of  @xmath3 . for low values of @xmath103 the mean degree of the network is small , and the resulting density of edges is too low to produce percolation in the network , so there is no giant component . as @xmath103 increases , however , there comes a point , clearly visible on the plot , at which the edge density is great enough to form a giant component . figure  [ gc ] reveals two interesting features of this transition .",
    "first , the position of the transition , the value of the parameter @xmath103 at which it takes place , is smaller in assortatively mixed networks than in disassortative ones . in other words",
    ", it appears that the presence of assortativity in the degree correlation pattern allows the network to percolate more easily .",
    "this result is intuitively reasonable : the core group of the assortative network seen in fig .",
    "[ graphs]a has a higher density of edges than the network as a whole and so one would expect percolation to take place in this region before it would in a network with the same average density but no core group .",
    "second , the figure shows that , even though the assortative network percolates more easily than its disassortative counterpart , its largest component does not grow as large as that of the disassortative network in the limit where @xmath103 becomes large .",
    "this too can be understood in simple terms : percolation occurs more easily when there is a core group , but is also largely confined to that core group and so does not spread to as large a portion of the network as it would in other cases .    in epidemiological terms , one could think of these two results as indicating that assortative networks will support the spread and persistence of a disease more easily than disassortative ones , because they possess a core group of connected high - degree vertices .",
    "but the disease is also restricted mostly to that core group . in a disassortative network , although percolation and hence epidemic disease requires a denser network to begin with , when it does happen it will affect a larger fraction of the network , because it is not restricted to a core group .",
    "in this article we have examined two related properties of networks : community structure and assortative mixing .",
    "we have described a new algorithm for finding groups of tightly - knit vertices within networks  communities in our nomenclature  which is based on the calculation of an `` edge betweenness '' index for network edges .",
    "the algorithm appears to be successful at detecting known community structure in various example networks , and we have found that a number of real - world networks do indeed possess community structure to a greater or lesser degree .    turning to possible explanations for this structure",
    "we have suggested that assortative mixing , the preferential association of vertices in a network with others that are like them in some way , is one possible mechanism for community formation .",
    "we have defined a measure of the strength of assortative mixing and applied it , for example , to data on mixing by race in social networks , showing that there is strong assortativity in this case , at least for the survey data that we have examined .",
    "we have also given a simple algorithm for creating networks with assortative mixing according to discrete characteristics imposed upon the vertices , and used it to generate example networks which , when fed into our community detection algorithm , reveal strong community structure similar to that seen in the real - world data .",
    "this lends some conviction to the theory that assortative mixing could , at least in some cases , be a contributing factor in the formation of communities within networks .",
    "we have also looked at assortative mixing by scalar characteristics of vertices , such as the age of individuals in a social network , and particularly vertex degree . by measuring mixing of the latter type for a variety of different networks",
    ", we have shown that social networks appear often to be assortatively mixed by degree , while technological and biological networks appear normally to be disassortative . using computer",
    "generated model networks we have also shown that assortativity by vertex degree makes networks percolate more easily ",
    "they develop a giant component for a lower average edge density than a similar network with neutral or disassortative mixing .",
    "conversely , however , disassortative networks tend to have larger giant components when they do develop .",
    "these findings have implications for epidemiology , for example : they imply that a disease spreading on a network that is assortatively mixed , as most social networks appear to be , would reach epidemic proportions more easily than on a disassortative network , but that the epidemic might ultimately affect fewer people than in the disassortative case .",
    "looking ahead , some obvious next steps in the studies presented here are the application of community finding algorithms to other networks , the study of mixing patterns in other networks , and theoretical investigations of the effects of assortative mixing and other network correlations on network structure and function , including for instance network resilience and network epidemiology .",
