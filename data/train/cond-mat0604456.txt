    "a random walker ( of same radius @xmath15 ) is launched from far away and wanders until it touches the seed , whereupon it sticks to it .",

    "we immediately note that for an incoming random walker , the points at a distance @xmath394 from the already formed structure acts like absorbers .",
    "hence , it is tempting to introduce a screening length @xmath0 @xcite , measuring how deep the random walkers penetrate the cluster before sticking to it .",
    "however , contrary to the systems studied so far in this paper , which were infinite and homogeneous , a dla cluster is finite and its density from the center decays in average as @xmath395 the determination of @xmath0 is an important matter , being often an essential ingredient in the theoretical attempts to determine @xmath396 .",
    "although mean - field theories are based on contradicting estimates for @xmath0 , typically @xmath397 @xcite or @xmath398 @xcite , they mostly consider that @xmath399 .",

    "then a large number of independent random walkers are released .",
    "if one of them touches a particle of the cluster , it simply vanishes , and its last position is recorded .",
    "the distribution of the positions of absorption is thus obtained and its standard deviation is considered as a measure of @xmath0 ( before or after averaging over many clusters having the same number of particles ) . although a certain consensus seems to exist in the literature , we do not believe that this variance is a faithful measure of @xmath0 . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the simple example of a perfectly absorbing ellipse in @xmath7 of aspect ratio @xmath401 and main axis @xmath38 .",
    "any method to measure @xmath0 should retrieve the trivial result that @xmath402 in this case .",
    "however , the method presented above would obviously lead to @xmath403 ! it is correct that dla clusters grown in the continuum are statistically isotropic .",
    "however , for a given cluster , the fluctuation of the length of the main branches are typically of size @xmath38 , leading to an automatic numerical evaluation of @xmath37 . in other words , even if the random walkers were only absorbed near the tip of these branches , physically implying a very small value of @xmath0 , the current method of estimating @xmath0 would invariably lead to @xmath404 .    as an alternative method ( but which might prove as ineffective as the one above ) , we propose that one should measure the distance of penetration from the _ convex hull _ of the cluster , and to measure the variance of this length _ before _ averaging over many clusters .",
    "at least , this method gives the correct result for the ellipse ( its own convex hull ) , that is , @xmath402 .",
    "finally , inspired by the general conclusions of the previous sections , we would like to give three related arguments in favor of the result @xmath37 , which we think is correct , although it is argued that the available numerical simulations using the method exposed above are not conclusive on this matter . particles in a dla cluster are obviously strongly correlated , arranging themselves in highly ramified structures .",
    "it is thus tempting to apply some of our result to this situation :    * there is no finite correlation length in a dla cluster except , rather trivially , for the size of the cluster itself . for long - range correlations",
    ", we have found that @xmath405 . * in a dla cluster , the density correlation function decays as @xmath29 , with @xmath406 .",

    "( [ rhodla ] ) ) . * since a dla cluster is fractal , the largest voids inside it are of typical linear size @xmath408 . in homogeneous structures , @xmath409 , which suggests again that for dla , @xmath410 .",
    "in this paper , we have justified analytically the heuristic argument presented in the introduction to estimate the screening length in a system of uniformly distributed perfect or imperfect absorbers .",
    "our results in @xmath7 and @xmath28 are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "even the numerical prefactors of the two first moments are surprisingly well described by our approach . as a further check",

    "these results were confirmed numerically in directed percolation , where the active sites play the role of the absorbers .",
    "finally , we have argued that for dla , the penetration or screening length @xmath0 should be of the same order as the linear size @xmath38 of a cluster . we have also emphasized that the current numerical method of determining @xmath0 , although finding just @xmath37 , could hardly lead to any other result . as a more appropriate method , we propose measuring the distance of penetration from the convex hull of the cluster , and to define @xmath0 as the standard deviation of this length before averaging over many clusters . with this definition ,",
