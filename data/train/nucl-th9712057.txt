    "the occurrence of quadrupole components in the n to @xmath1 transition is within quark models related to d - state configurations in the nucleon and/or the @xmath1 wavefunction @xcite .",
    "they originate from details of the inner dynamics of the composite nucleon like a color hyperfine interaction in the one - gluon - exchange @xcite and , therefore , are of interest for the understanding of the nucleon structure .",
    "the precise measurement of the quadrupole amplitudes is a long standing experimental problem due to their smallness compared to the dominating magnetic dipole amplitude . only observables carrying interference terms between the large and the small amplitudes offer sufficient sensitivity for a reliable determination .",
    "appropriate interferences are accessible in @xmath3-electroproduction experiments off the proton where the resonance is tagged by its decay into proton and @xmath0 , and either the pion or the recoiling proton is detected in coincidence with the scattered electron .",
    "early coincidence experiments at nina @xcite and desy @xcite extracted , with large experimental uncertainties , ratios of coulomb quadrupole to magnetic dipole strength , @xmath4 , around @xmath5 over a range of four - momentum transfers of @xmath6 to @xmath7  ( gev / c)@xmath8 .",
    "a fixed - t dispersion - relation based reanalysis @xcite of older data @xcite yielded surprisingly large numbers of about @xmath9 at momentum transfers down to @xmath10  ( gev / c)@xmath8 .",
    "a comparatively large ratio of @xmath11 was also obtained in a recent experiment at elsa , which measured the azimuthal angular distribution of the high energetic photon from the @xmath0-decay around the momentum transfer direction @xcite .",
    "all the experiments extracted the sum of resonant and non - resonant quadrupole components .",
    "a separation was achieved for the first time in a pion - photoproduction experiment at mami . there , a linearly polarized tagged photon beam was used to determine photon asymmetries simultaneously for both neutral and charged pion production @xcite , thus enabling the decomposition into isospin @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels of the electric quadrupole amplitude , e2 , at the photon point .",
    "further insight into the electric quadrupole admixture of the n to @xmath1 transition could be obtained by a precise determination of the resonant @xmath14 ratio as a function of four - momentum transfer .",
    "this would constrain the spatial distribution of the electric charge in the transition .    polarized electron beams in combination with polarized proton targets or recoil proton polarimetry open possibilities for new approaches .",
    "the @xmath15 reaction has been examined with regard to a measurement of the longitudinal quadrupole component in the n to @xmath1 transition and the separation of resonant and non - resonant pieces .",
    "the next section recalls briefly the general formalism for @xmath0-electroproduction and then discusses the possibilities of recoil polarization measurements , particularly in parallel kinematics where the recoiling proton is detected in momentum transfer direction .",

    "following the notation of raskin and donnelly @xcite , the differential cross section for the @xmath15 reaction can be written as [ eq : x - sec6 ] ( ) & = & ( v_l r_fi^l + v_t r_fi^t + v_ttr_fi^tt + v_lt r_fi^lt ) + + & & + h ( v_tr_fi^t + v_lt r_fi^lt ) with @xmath16 @xmath17 is the invariant mass of the recoiling hadronic system , @xmath18 the proton momentum in the center - of - momentum frame , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the proton and pion rest mass , respectively .",
    "the electron kinematics enters into the factors @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) : [ eq : v ] v_l & = & ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 + v_t & = & ( ) + ^2 + v_tt & = & - ( ) + v_lt & = & - ( ) + v_t & = & + v_lt & = & - ( ) in the above equations , @xmath23 is the electron scattering angle , @xmath24 the square of the three - momentum transfer , @xmath25 is the negative squared four - momentum transfer , and @xmath26 is the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam .",
    "the structure of the hadronic system is contained in the six structure functions @xmath27 , which implicitly contain the proton polarization .",
    "the dependence on proton polarization can be made explicit , leading to a total of 18 structure functions @xcite in the cross section : [ eq : x - sec18 ] ( ) & = & k_mott \\",

    "the longitudinal unit vector , @xmath32 , is in the direction of the proton momentum in the center - of - momentum frame , @xmath33 points normal to the reaction plane and @xmath34 is perpendicular to the proton momentum in the reaction plane .",
    "the connection between the r structure functions and the w structure functions as defined by raskin and donnelly @xcite is given in the appendix .",
    "from the cross section of eq.([eq : x - sec18 ] ) one gets for the recoil proton polarization components [ eq : pltn_cm ] _ 0 p_l & = & \\ { v_lt+ v_tt2 + h } + _ 0 p_t & = & \\ { v_lt+ v_tt2 + h } + _ 0 p_n & = & \\ { v_l+ v_t+ v_lt+ v_tt2 + h v_lt } , where @xmath35 represents the proton polarization independent part of the cross section .",

    "the second term depends on @xmath44 , like the projection of a polarization which is fixed in the electron scattering plane onto the rotating @xmath45 frame .",
    "this part _ does not _ vanish in parallel kinematics .",
    "similarly the other components of eq.([eq : pt_simple ] ) also contain projections of a fixed polarization in the electron scattering plane .",
    "the natural choice for a polarization , @xmath46 , that is fixed in the electron scattering plane is the @xmath47 frame of fig.[fig : kin ] , which is related to the @xmath48 system by a simple rotation : [ eq : transformation ] p_x & = & + - + p_y & = & + + + p_z & = & - in the case of parallel kinematics this transformation remains still defined .",
    "the angle @xmath38 then plays the role of the orientation of the transverse polarization , @xmath49 , relative to the electron scattering plane .    the proton polarization components can be expressed by the multipole decomposition of the structure functions according to @xcite .",

    "@xmath52 carries in parallel kinematics a high sensitivity to the small longitudinal quadrupole amplitude , @xmath55 , due to the interference with the large @xmath50 amplitude .",
    "it is , however , not solely determined by resonant amplitudes , but receives both resonant and non - resonant contributions . the induced polarization , @xmath54 ( eq.[eq : py_simple ] ) , measures the imaginary part of the same combinations of interference terms of which @xmath52 ( eq.[eq : px_simple ] ) determines the real part .",
    "this offers the possibility to disentangle resonant and non - resonant pieces , which will later be discussed in more detail .",
    "@xmath53 is dominated by @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the two in - plane polarization components , @xmath57 , is directly related to @xmath58 . @xmath52 and @xmath53 are simultaneously accessible behind a ( spin precessing ) magnetic system like a proton spectrometer . in the ratio @xmath59 the absolute values of both the electron beam polarization and the analyzing power of the proton polarimeter",

    "the considerations of the preceeding section illustrate the sensitivity of the recoil proton polarization to the @xmath55 quadrupole amplitude for parallel kinematics . a real experiment will cover a finite solid angle around the strictly parallel case .",
    "therefore , in this section the azimuthal averaging of the polarization components @xmath60 is considered . for this discussion the polarization ( eq.([eq : pltn_cm ] ) ) is projected from the center - of - momentum into the laboratory frame @xcite .",
    "the corresponding transformation is given by the so - called wigner - rotation @xcite : [ eq : wigner_rot ] p_t^lab & = & p_t + p_l + p_l^lab & = & - p_t + p_l + p_n^lab & = & p_n the wigner angle , @xmath61 , is given by @xmath62 where the lorentz factors @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related to the velocities of the center - of - momentum frame against the laboratory frame , and of the proton in the cm and lab frames , respectively . the transformation [ eq : xyz_projection ] p_x^lab & = & ^lab _ p^lab + ^lab _ p^lab - ^lab + p_y^lab & = & ^lab _ p^lab + ^lab _",

    "the \\{x , y , z}-components of eq.([eq : xyz_projection ] ) are azimuthally averaged around the direction of the momentum transfer , @xmath41 , which is indicated by the bar in the following equations .",
    "only those terms with even powers of @xmath66 and @xmath44 survive the integration over @xmath38 . keeping for the sake of clarity only terms containing the dominant @xmath50 amplitude ,",

    "the sensitivity to the @xmath67 interference term decreases with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 shows practically the same behaviour , but reduced by a factor 4 , while the weight of @xmath70 is almost constant .",
    "in the limit of parallel kinematics , eqs.([eq : px_lab_m1+]-[eq : pz_lab_m1 + ] ) reduce to eqs.([eq : px_simple]-[eq : pz_simple ] ) . keeping also the non - leading terms in the s and p wave approximation ,",

    "this fact can be exploited for a separation of contributions due to the delta - resonance from other contributions , which are caused either by non - resonant @xmath0-production or by higher nucleon resonances .",
    "the multipole amplitudes of eqs.([eq : px_par_complete]-[eq : pz_par_complete ] ) are not solely determined by the @xmath1-resonance , but contain both resonant and non - resonant pieces . therefore , in the following , the multipole combinations of @xmath52and @xmath54 ( eqs.[eq : px_par_complete ] and [ eq : py_par_complete ] ) are split into their resonant and non - resonant parts .",
    "this is closely related to the decomposition of the physical @xmath0-electroproduction amplitudes , @xmath71 , into isospin @xmath72 and @xmath73 channels @xcite . @xmath74 as stated by the watson final state theorem @xcite , all @xmath75 amplitudes show the almost purely resonant behaviour of @xmath76 .",

    "on the other hand , for real born terms @xmath83 vanishes , i.e. eq.([eq : px_m1+_3/2 ] ) yields : @xmath84 this means that , within the approximations discussed , @xmath52 contains directly the wanted isospin 3/2 part of the @xmath85 amplitude .",
    "non - born contributions might occur due to either rescattering processes or higher resonances , like @xmath86 from the roper n(1440 ) .",
    "if there were non - born imaginary parts contributing , eq.([eq : px_isodecomp ] ) would be more complicated .",
    "such terms are in principle detectable through @xmath54 , because real and imaginary parts of the amplitudes are related by fixed phases as requested by watson s final state theorem .",
    "therefore imaginary parts in @xmath87 go along with an altered real part @xmath88 as compared to purely real non - resonant amplitudes .",
    "the polarization of recoil protons can be measured in a focal plane polarimeter behind a magnetic spectrometer , like the proton polarimeter @xcite of the a1 collaboration @xcite at mami .",
    "such a device measures the azimuthal asymmetry of protons which were inclusively scattered in a carbon secondary scatterer . with this process ,",
    "only the two polarization components perpendicular to the proton momentum are accessible . due to the spin precession in the spectrometer magnetic system , these two polarization components measured in the focal plane are linear combinations of all three components at the target , @xmath89 . provided a complete understanding of the spin precession , the measurement of only two focal plane polarization components is nevertheless sufficient to determine all three target components , because there is additional information from flipping the electron beam helicity : @xmath52 and @xmath53 are odd under helicity reversal , while @xmath54 is even ( cf . eqs.([eq : px_simple]-[eq : pz_simple ] ) ) .",
    "the averaging over the azimuthal angle , @xmath38 , which leads to the expressions discussed in section [ sec : angle ] , can be easily accomplished in the case of parallel kinematics where the spectrometer sits in the momentum transfer direction . here",
    "the sensitivity to the longitudinal quadrupole amplitude , @xmath55 , is maximum . it is higher than in previously proposed experiments with distinct measurements left and right of the momentum transfer direction @xcite .",
    "the comparatively high degree of proton polarization in those experiments is only due to the mixing of the large @xmath53 component , which according to eq.([eq : pz_lab_m1 + ] ) contains a @xmath56 term , into the considered @xmath49 polarization components at finite angles .",
    "in contrast to a non - magnetic polarimeter , where the longitudinal proton polarization component is inaccessible , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be measured simultaneously behind the spectrometer .",
    "this allows the mesaurement of the ratio @xmath59 with obvious advantages :    1 .",
    "the leading term of this ratio is directly @xmath90 .",
    "2 .   in the polarization ratio",
    "the absolute value of the electron beam polarization cancels out .",
    "the recoil polarizations are determined by polarimeter asymmetries with a common effective analyzing power .",
    "the polarization ratio is thus also independent of the absolute value of the polarimeter s analyzing power .",
    "therefore such a measurement can be performed without monitoring the electron beam polarization .",
    "the beam polarization need even not be constant over time , because both recoil polarization components are measured truely simultaneously .",
    "the absolute calibration of the effective polarimeter analyzing power is neither required , since in the ratio it cancels out , too .",
    "a similar polarization - ratio method was successfully employed in a recent measurement of the neutron electric formfactor @xcite .",
    "the influence of possible non - born contributions to the measured ratio can be studied via the induced polarization , @xmath54 .",
    "this component is independent of the electron beam polarization and thus more sensitive to false systematic asymmetries . for the analysis of @xmath54",
    "the absolute calibration of the proton polarimeter is therefore desirable , although a ratio measurement @xmath91 could also be imagined . in any case , the beam polarization must be known , since in the @xmath91-ratio the polarimeter analyzing power cancels , but the beam polarization does not .      accounting only for the leading terms in the above expressions ( cf .",
    "eqs.([eq : px_simple],[eq : pz_simple ] ) ) and neglecting a possible offset due to imaginary parts of the non - resonant amplitudes , the recoil proton polarization in parallel kinematics can be estimated by p_x & = & h v_lt n^2 \\{4,m_1 + } + p_z & = & h v_t n^2 |m_1+|^2 with the proton polarization independent cross section approximated through @xmath92 one receives p_x & = & 4 h + [ eq : px_approx ] & = & -8 h + & = & -8h ( _ e/2 ) , + p_z & = & h + [ eq : pz_approx ] & = & h .",
    "@xmath93^{-1}$ ] is the virtual photon s degree of transverse polarization . making use of the relations of appendix d of @xcite between cgln amplitudes @xcite and structure functions ,",
    "the above relation for @xmath53 can be shown to hold generally in parallel kinematics , i.e. independently of the approximations discussed . fixed by kinematical variables only , @xmath53 might thus be used for calibration checks . applying the electron kinematics of the mami @xmath94-@xmath1 proposal @xcite , @xmath95 , eqs.([eq : px_approx ] ) and ( [ eq : pz_approx ] ) yield [ eq : px_estimate ] p_x & = & - 2.2 h + p_z & = & 0.7 h .",
    "thus , a quadrupole contribution of the order of @xmath96% causes a transverse proton polarization of @xmath97 with an electron beam polarization of 70% , which now routinely is achieved @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal proton polarization then is @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath99 reaction with measurement of the recoil proton polarization has a large potential towards the precise determination of the longitudinal quadrupole component , @xmath85 , in the n to @xmath1 transition .",
    "in particular in parallel kinematics , it offers on top of the @xmath1 resonance a high sensitivity to the @xmath67 interference term .",
    "this is clearly revealed when the process is discussed in the appropriate @xmath47 coordinate frame , which is fixed to the electron scattering plane ( see fig.[fig : kin ] ) . here",
    "the polarization transfer from the electron takes a simple form and is not obscured by projections onto rotating reference frames .",
    "the ratio of the recoil proton polarization components , @xmath59 , is directly related to @xmath90 .",
    "if both components are measured simultaneously after the deflection in a magnetic spectrometer , the absolute values of both electron beam polarization and polarimeter analyzing power cancel out .",
