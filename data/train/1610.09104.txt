    "magnetic reconnection is an important physical process occurring when two anti - parallel magnetic field lines encounter .",
    "main feature of reconnection is the sudden restructuration of the magnetic field lines topology into a new more stable and more favourable energetic configuration , accompanied with the release of the magnetic energy priorly stored in the reconnecting magnetic field lines .",
    "the released energy concurs to heating and accelerating plasma particles , which makes magnetic reconnection a strongly kinetic process .",
    "historically , magnetic reconnection has been mainly studied in the astrophysical domains to explain explosive astrophysical events such as solar flares and geomagnetic substorms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in terrestrial applications ,",
    "however , magnetic reconnection is encountered in fusion devices as responsible for magnetic island formation and tearing mode evolution , with detrimental consequences to plasma confinement and sustained fusion power production @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , simulations of the ion scale evolution with typical achievable plasma laboratory parameters is still particularly poorly represented in the literature .",
    "previous studies on the reconnection ion dynamics have already been presented for the astrophysical cases ( .e.g * ? ? ? * ) and astrophysical reconnection explained with ad - hoc laboratory setup ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but to date poor knowledge is shared on the ion dynamics under suitable conditions for terrestrial purposes . to further reduce this gap , in this work we present a parametric study from fully kinetic simulations of the ion acceleration from magnetic reconnection initially set with typical plasma laboratory values . in particular ,",
    "we aim at quantifying the effectiveness of magnetic reconnection for plasma acceleration and propulsion . with this purpose ,",
    "the average outflow velocity across a specific cross section normal to the outflow direction is taken into consideration . from the latter",
    ", a specific quantity is especially derived through the ratio of the average velocity and the gravitational acceleration constant @xmath0 ( at sea level ) , in order to resemble the specific impulse traditionally used to distinguish among different plasma propulsion technologies .",
    "after an initial set of nine runs for hydrogen plasma at a reduced mass ratio @xmath1 with different magnetic field strenghts and electron temperatures , a more detailed analysis of the most promising case is performed by raising the mass ratio to the realistic value @xmath2 .",
    "besides the energetic analysis of the reconnection outflow , we observe the formation of a set of flow shock discontinuities , which partially remind those found by means of magnetofluidodynamics ( mhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ sec : simulations ] gives an exhaustive description of the code used and all the configurations considered in this work .",
    "interesting results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] will draw the most important conclusion , as well as point out possible future work directions .",
    "all simulations have been performed using the fully kinetic massively parallel implicit moment particle - in - cell code ipic3d @xcite .",
    "simulations are addressed in 2.5 dimensions , meaning that all the vector quantities are three dimensional but their spatial variation is solved on a two dimensional plane .",
    "this choice allows for a better representation of the evolution projected on a specific plane by maintaining the three dimensional nature of the problem .",
    "the code makes use of the following normalizations : lengths are normalized to the ion skin depth @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ion plasma frequency , as well as the time unit in ipic3d , velocities are normalized to the speed of light @xmath5 , particles charge is normalized to the electric charge @xmath6 and mass is normalized to the ion mass @xmath7 .",
    "the initial configuration consists of a @xmath8 box with a single not - balanced current sheet . in the simulations , a fixed cartesian frame of reference",
    "is adopted , with the @xmath9 coordinate being parallel to the current sheet , the @xmath10 coordinate being the direction of the magnetic field change , and the @xmath11 coordinate completing the reference set in the out - of - plane direction . by considering a typical density value of @xmath12",
    ", it translates to a simulated box size of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , which perfectly integrates with the traditional laboratory devices scale .",
    "while the initial density is kept constant all over the domain , together with the initial temperature , the magnetic profile across the current sheet follows the widely used hyperbolic function from the harris equilibrium @xcite , which reads    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the current sheet half - thickness , here chosen as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the asymptotic magnetic field intensity .",
    "this specific initial setup partially recalls the not - force - free simulation studied in @xcite . however , main difference between the two cases is the very low-@xmath19 attained with the values here considered ( i.e. @xmath20 ) , compared to the high-@xmath19 configuration proposed in that analysis .",
    "an initial perturbation is applied in the middle of the current sheet to trigger the reconnection process at a selected point .",
    "boundary conditions are chosen open along each boundary to better represent a realistic physical system .",
    "particles and fields are free to escape the domain across the @xmath9 boundaries , together with a particles re - injection from the @xmath10 borders , similarly to what is done in @xcite .",
    "this approach allows for a significant reduction of the simulated domain , although the choice of using open boundary conditions poses further remarkable differences in the reconnection outcome physics with respect to the traditional periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we performed a set of 9 simulations by maintaining fixed the ion temperature at @xmath21 ( i.e. room temperature ) , and varying the magnetic field intensity and electron temperature according to the values summarized in table [ tab : runs ] .",
    "table [ tab : runs ] also reports the corresponding values of the alfvn and ion acoustic speeds , together with the plasma parameter @xmath19 as the ratio between thermal and magnetic energy .",
    "the ion acoustic speed considers a polytropic index @xmath22 typical of ideal plasmas .",
    "the initial particles velocity distribution is considered pure maxwellian with no initial drift .",
    "the range of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 values has been chosen within values easily achievable in laboratory using common magnets and heating systems .",

    "an increasing outflow velocity is observed as both the temperature and magnetic field increase . in particular ,",
    "the highest outflow velocity is observed for run 9 ( fig [ fig : vxionsruns].c ) , in condition of high magnetic field and high electron temperature .",
    "also , the reconnection evolution is observed to be particularly rapid , being fully developed already at @xmath46 , as can be seen from run 9 where reconnection is at later stages of development compared to cases of weaker @xmath23-field ( e.g. the run 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the formation of secondary islands is observed all over the current sheet , as a conseguence of the initial chosen not - equilibrium ( some reminiscence is visible at the edges of the simulated box e.g. at @xmath47 in figure [ fig : vxionsruns ] ) .",
    "these islands show to have a small amplitude and are being completely wiped out by the main reconnection outflow from the initially perturbated region .",
    "the latter underlines the importance of applying an initial localized perturbation to trigger the process at a preferred location . with no initial perturbation ,",
    "the process would start at few randomly distributed reconnection locations along the current sheet , growing and evolving irregularly until ultimately interacting and merging together to form larger magnetic islands , as explained e.g. in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , larger magnetic islands are seen to form and stand near to the region where the reconnection takes origin .",
    "this effect is commonly found since the earliest simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) and is not seen to be influencing the following analysis , provided that only cross - sections far from this region are considered .",
    "this section aims at comparing the ion velocity obtained from the simulations with that from existing theoretical models , such as those described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : vxiva ] shows for each run the ion outflow profiles along the current sheet normalized to the inflow alfvn speed , as computed considering only the in - plane components ( i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) to address a better comparison with pure 2d models . despite this approximation",
    ", we noticed an insensibile influence of the @xmath11-component compared to the @xmath50 case .",
    "the inflow alfvn speed has been evaluated at the location where the three characteristic velocities @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 begin to diverge ( i.e. @xmath54 , depending on the run and time considered ) , whereas the time window was chosen to follow the reconnection region before the formation of the central island .",
    "the analysis reveals a maximum velocity outflow nearly half as fast as the inflow alfvn speed , and equally developed over all runs , followed by a steep velocity drop at the edge caused by the formation of a dipolarization front @xcite .",
    "results are charted in table [ tab : predvel ] , second column .    even though considered at its very first stages ,",
    "magnetic reconnection develops a series of loss channels causing a remarkable velocity drop from the theoretical alfvnic value .",
    "however , still noticeable is the nearly constant outflow value held over all the cases , with values up to @xmath55 ( i.e. run @xmath56 ) .    in the same table",
    "we compare these results with those from the model proposed by sweet and parker @xcite ( fourth and fifth columns ) and the recent model in @xcite ( third column ) .",
    "the basic sweet - parker model states that the output velocity is alfvenic when the @xmath57 term is neglected in the equation of motion . on the other hand ,",
    "the reconnection outflow can be either slowed down further or accelerated by the presence of a pressure gradient along its ouflow direction .",
    "an updated model was then proposed including the pressure gradient @xcite , and used here for comparison .",
    "the results for our configuration are shown in column four .",
    "in particular , the pressure difference between the outflow and the inflow region has been considered for the assessment .",
    "likewise , plasma compressibility can also play an important role at influencing the outflow velocity .",
    "its effect has been here taken into account in a separate evaluation given in the fifth column .    .",
    "values are computed from simulations by only considering the @xmath9 and @xmath10 component , and are normalized to the inflow alfvn speed . ]",
    "the analysis shows a qualitative agreement with the compressible sweet - parker model and , to a lesser extent , with the @xcite s model , with the latter mostly limited to the first three cases with the lowest field intensity .",
    "the opposite is observed for the sweet - parker model considering the pressure gradient . even though the outflow pressure results remarkably greater than the inflow pressure ( not shown here for conciseness ) , such gradient is not significantly affecting the outflow velocity . on the contrary ,",
    "the model predicts a super - alfvnic outflow velocity in line with the @xmath58 limit explained in @xcite for low @xmath57 . the relevant difference between this and the other models can be explained by the initial setup",
    "adopted : despite the large pressure difference between inflow and outflow , the thermal energy ( @xmath59 ) is initially much lower than the magnetic field energy ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "being the alfvn speed dependent on @xmath38 , and the pressure term dependent on the temperature , the remarkable field intensity and low temperature adopted here makes the pressure term much less dominant than the alfvn speed term in the balance .",
    "vice versa , the sweet - parker model including the compressibility instead results in qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations , with a satisfactory accuracy ( @xmath61 ) for runs 7 to 9 , where the magnetic field becomes more intense .",
    "finally , the discrepancy between the simakov - chacn model @xcite and the simulations can be explained by the intrinsic assumptions made in the model , which cause it to fail when the magnetic pressure far exceed the plasma pressure , as occurring in low-@xmath19 laboratory plasmas .",
    "figure [ fig : vxionsruns ] shows that the highest outflow velocity is reached in run @xmath36 ( at higher b - field and @xmath24 ) .",
    "this run @xmath36 is therefore taken as reference for a further analysis with a realistic mass ratio @xmath2 .",
    "notice that table [ tab : predvel ] instead states differently : this difference is due to the inflow alfvn speed to which the velocity values are normalized , which depends on the different inflow conditions .",
    "the temporal step is now set at @xmath43 and we extended the global simulation time to observe the process over its whole evolution .",
    "first of all , in figure [ fig : cq ] we show the temporal energy budget shared after the reconnection event between the electromagnetic fields ( em ) and particles . @xmath62",

    "these values are normalized to the totale energy @xmath67 at each time step .",
    "the magnitude at @xmath68 yields @xmath69 . besides neglecting the electric field energy ,",
    "we observe that up to @xmath70 of the initial magnetic energy is converted to particles energy during the first reconnection stages , with the thermal energy increasingly dominating the budget , to indicate that plasma is initially accelerated and later heated . a steady budget",
    "is then reached up to @xmath71 .",

    ", the separatrices appear to be remarkably highlighted due to the repentine change of the particles flow across them , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the density also shows an increased value , unlike temperature and entropy which are not seen particularly marked .",
    "this situation resembles the petschek - like slow shocks pointed out in @xcite , and recently found in kinetic simulations @xcite .",
    "interestingly is also the horizontal feature seen at @xmath93 straightly coming out from the reconnection region , and visible over all the plots .",
    "unlike what seen in @xcite , whereby this signature coincides with a marked density cavity , in our case the density in this region appears to be larger , together with an increase in the temperature and a decrease in entropy with respect to the surrounding plasma .",
    "noticeable are also the diagonal structures observed between @xmath94 , which show a remarkable temperature and density growth .",
    "such structures are also highlighted by @xmath86 , revealing the presence of a very complex symmetric structure upstream .",
    "furthermore , right behind the oblique discontinuities the magnetic field is noticed to repentinely change its direction by turning almost vertical , which may be a clear signature of a rotational discontinuity accompanied with a shock . from the larger view in figure [ fig : vxionsruns1836 ]",
    ", we notice the outer region of the structure to be indeed describing the interaction between the outflow and a growing magnetic island standing near the reconnection point .",
    "finally , a strong entropy rise is observed downstream in between the two oblique discontinuities .",
    "a more irregular situation is instead observed later in time at @xmath95 .",
    "particularly noticeable is the series of oblique discontinuities observed within the closed magnetic field .",
    "this structure clearly resembles the diamond - chain described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the structure is seen to fade out while flowing out , disappearing before reaching the island center .",
    "this structure is especially highlighted by an increase in both temperature and entropy , while the density appears to only increment weakly , with the maximum values observed on the magnetic island borders .",

    "even though a more in - depth analysis would be required ( e.g. throughout a waln test ) , a first insight into the nature of these discontinuities can already be inferred by analysing the evolution of some relevant quantities across it .",
    "figure [ fig : shocks ] shows the evolution of temperature , pressure , entropy and density along the direction perpendicular to the discontinuity plane for the two time frames reported in figure [ fig : outflowanalysis ] .",
    "the profiles are normalized to the upstream value marked with a black circle in panels 6.a and 6.b .",
    "notice that in the abscissa of panels 6.c and 6.d the projection on the @xmath9 coordinate has been preferred to the normal arc - length for more clarity .",
    "two particular discontinuities are considered for the study , namely the sharp v - shape seen at @xmath97 and one of the visible jumps constituting the diamond - chain observed at @xmath98 . in the first case",
    ", we observe a pressure increase , as well as an increase in the entropy and temperature .",
    "in particular , the density ratio slightly decreases across the discontinuity , with the temperature ratio being larger than the density ratio .",
    "such evolution exhibits the typical behavior of a rarefaction wave @xcite .",
    "the situation reverses at time @xmath98 , where a compressive shock wave is encountered . at these later times ,",
    "all the quantities increase across the discontinuity . the temperature ratio is lower than the density ratio , and the downstream density is greater than upstream .",

    "this type of representation for the ions dynamics has already been established in the literature as a good approximation for the trajectory undergone by a single fluid volume @xcite . from the plots we notice that , at the first simulation stages , the ions approaching the farthest outflow regions are prone to being bounced out soon after crossing the separatrices .",
    "this effect has been observed to often occur in the presence of a magnetic island .",

    "[ fig : vxionsruns1836 ] . ]",
    "all the profiles show one or more peaks coinciding with the main outflow stream , whose amplitude is seen to decrease over time once the bulk outflow is past .",
    "after this point , reconnection is considered to be ended , and a new reconnection event might eventually be expected to take place .",
    "the positive values observed in the profiles ( according the frame of reference here adopted ) represent the particular ion dynamics due to the interaction with the magnetic islands formed along the process .",
    "the particles recirculation generated within a magnetic island causes the velocity to achieve both positive and negative directions . later than @xmath104",
    "the process is considered finished .    from the results in figure [ fig : isptime_mr1836 ]",
    "the best outcome is achieved through the cross section at @xmath105 , which describes the situation at the outer distances . in this region",
    "the specific impulse reaches the highest values , and the curve shows a much more regular profile .    additionally , we observe the peaks to be shifted leftwards and increased in magnitude over the cross sections to indicate an acceleration over the process .",
    "noticeable is also the double peak observed through the cross - section in @xmath106 , which points out a likely second acceleration of the ions at @xmath107 .",
    "the origin of this secondary acceleration is related to the occurrence of a secondary reconnection in the outflow .",
    "indeed , panel ( f ) in figure [ fig : vxionsruns1836 ] shows the signature of an additional occurring reconnection event at @xmath108 , which may lead to explain such particles acceleration .",
    "this section aims at giving further insights into the global energy budget under this particular configuration .",

    "the latter is normally negligible and so will be considered in this work . although being already considered in total energy equation [ eq : entot ] , the electromagnetic balance is explicitly shown in equation [ eq : electmagn ] for a better analysis .",

    "a decrease in @xmath115 corresponds to an increase in the bulk and thermal energy within the structures observed between @xmath116 in figure [ fig : outflowanalysis ] , indicating a particles acceleration and plasma heating at the expense of electromagnetic energy . also , remarkable is the sudden @xmath117 and @xmath118 reverse occurring downstream , i.e. between @xmath119 , caused by the outflow - island interaction , as further confirmed by panel ( d1e ) .    later in time , in correspondance of the _ diamond - chain _ structure within the closed magnetic island at @xmath120 ,",
    "we observe a situation similar to the previous step , with a slight @xmath115 decrease followed by an increase in enthalpy , mainly limited to the earliest part of the profile .",
    "however , the bulk energy flux now shows a rapidly reversing profile , as the one observed in panel ( d1e ) .",
    "the latter suggests the bulk energy is more influenced by the outflow - island interaction than the discontinuity structure , which in turn is mainly acting as plasma heater .",
    "moreover , at the end of the outflow , at around @xmath105 , the presence of a dipolarization front is highlighted by an increase in the enthalpy and @xmath115 .",
    "finally , the situation at @xmath121 shows a completely different situation .",
    "the remarked electromagnetic energy drop ( i.e. @xmath115 ) around @xmath122 is now only followed by an increase in enthalpy , while @xmath117 is seen to begin an oscillating escalation only later in the outflow .",
    "this latter behavior coincides with the turbulent outflow region seen in figure [ fig : vxionsruns1836 ] , where we observe an increment of the plasma thermal energy and a non - linear increase in the plasma bulk energy .      to gain more insights into the effective particle behavior within a moving fluid element , it is more interesting to analyse the energy budget by adopting a lagrangian frame .",
    "the bulk and thermal energy equations are now threated separately , and read    @xmath123    @xmath124    where the terms are the same as in the previous equations , in addition with the heat flux @xmath125 ( normally negligible ) , and the operator @xmath126 , which represents the total derivative .",
    "the @xmath10-integrated profiles are shown in panels ( a1l ) - ( d2l ) of figure [ fig : energytot ] for the same time steps as the case in eulerian frame .",
    "in correspondance of the discontinuity structures at @xmath114 , we now observe a dominance of @xmath127 against a decrease in @xmath115 and the velocity divergence ( @xmath128 ) to rapidly drop in favour of an increment of @xmath129 and the pressure tensor divergence ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "finally , from the thermal energy equation we understand that the discontinuity structure causes a slightly increase in all the terms .",
    "interesting is the situation downtream the outflow at @xmath131 and @xmath120 , such as an inversion of @xmath129 and a strong heating . the latter is describing the interaction of the outflow with an forming island .",
    "noticeable is also the situation described by equation [ eq : thermalenergy ] .",
    "all the terms are seen to follow the same pattern , with a large variation along the current sheet , except for the case at @xmath113 .",
    "the latter shows an overall weak heating in the island edges , followed by a strong cooling in the inner region , likely due to an expanding evolution .",
    "finally , significant is the sharp increment of the thermal component observed at @xmath121 within the turbulent outflow region .",
    "ffor a better understanding of the energy exchanged in the electromagnetic fields , we consider the evoluton of the poynting vector , whose @xmath9 and @xmath10 components and its divergence are shown in figure [ fig : poyn ] .",
    "the component along @xmath11 has been left out as not contributing to the energy term @xmath115 . on the whole",
    ", we notice that the @xmath9 component remains steadily negative over all the process . in symmetric reconnection",
    "this component is mainly driven by the out - of - plane hall magnetic field @xmath99 @xcite , as it also happens in this case .",
    "however , notice that this situation reverses around @xmath132 at @xmath133 , where a second reconnection event is taking place by generating a strong positive electromagnetic energy flux .",
    "the latter is governed by @xmath134 , with @xmath135 being dominating quantity in this region . at the latest stage ,",
    "a magnetic island is completely formed .",
    "the poynting flux now signals a double @xmath136 polarity , where the positive part is clearly given by a reconnection outflow shaping the island itself .",
    "the component along @xmath10 also gives a good indication of reconnection .",
    "we observe a strong positive - negative energy flux all over outside the reconneciton region , and a void value in the outflow , until the encounter with the magnetic island .",
    "the energy flux is only dominated by the convective electric field @xmath137 .",
    "being the inflow velocity nearly along @xmath9 and the magnetic field principally along @xmath9 , the poynting component correctly indicates @xmath135 is the dominant term .",
    "no energy exchange is seen in the outflow , as expected given the peculiar properties of the separatrices in shaping reconnection @xcite .",
    "interesting is , however , the quadrupolar _ flower _ structure observed in the island between @xmath138 , which is later destroyed as the process goes on .",
    "this pattern is dominated by the @xmath139 term , which in turn is seen to be governed by the field @xmath140 ( plots not shown here ) .",
    "finally , @xmath115 gives an insight into the energy flow magnitude . from figure",
    "[ fig : poyn ] we observe that this quantity is predominantly negative , except for some reversed structures seen after the discontinuities analyzed earlier , where @xmath115 becomes strongly positive .",
    "the whole evolution is then predominantly driven by the gradient of @xmath136 , except for the interaction with a forming island , whereby the @xmath141 component plays a more important role .",
    "as the reconnection continues , the magnitude becomes particularly irregular , followed by a more collimated pattern along the outflow direction , probably due to secondary reconnection events taking over ( e.g. at @xmath142 ) .     and",
    "@xmath10 components of the poynting vector , as well as its divergence @xmath115 , at the time steps considered for the energy analysis .",

    "are halved thanks to the symmetry of the system with respect to the x - point .",
    "we focus only on the eulerian approach to better understand the energy flows across the whole system . on the whole",
    ", we notice the electromagnetic profiles , including @xmath143 and @xmath115 , to show a certain degree of periodicity with period of nearly @xmath144 .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as reconnection to be still at its unsteady stage , with the steadiness attained after @xmath145 . accordingly , after this point all the temporal terms on the lefthand side of the equation are nulled . from panel ( a ) , we notice a certain intial delay before the initial electromagnetic energy is converted into bulk and enthalpy energy ( nearly @xmath146 ) . after this initial latency",
    ", the total energy is mainly converted to both bulk and enthalpy energy , with the latter receiving the greater share .",
    "the enthalpy is seen to rapidly grow in the range @xmath147 and sharply drop afterwards , meanwhile the bulk energy continues to slightly grow with a lower rate until the steady state is reached .",
    "plasma is therefore firstly rapidly heated and then mildly constantly accelerated . from panel",
    "( b ) we observe that the most dominant terms over the unsteady period are the temporal variation of the magnetic energy and the poynting vector flux , both following a pulsed behavion .",
    "moreover , we notice as the latter obtains a positive value between @xmath148 , to indicate that some electromagnetic energy has been earlier accumulated and later released to build the em up again .",
    "this em build - up results typical of reconnection and positively concur to keep the partcle energy state significantly high , as confirmed by the jumps in the @xmath129 profile .     and",

    "all terms are introduced in the text . ]",
    "this work aimed at analysing the ion dynamics from fully kinetic simulations of symmetric magnetic reconnection in typical laboratory plasma configurations .",
    "simulations were performed using the massively parallel fully - kinetic implicit - moment particle - in - cell code ipic3d @xcite .",
    "a not - force free unbalanced profile is adopted across the current sheet to significantly accelerate the reconnection process and at the same time allow for a free choice of the initial setup .",
    "a set of nine simulations with reduced mass ratio @xmath1 has been performed by permuting three significant values of the magnetic field ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 ) , and electron temperature ( @xmath152 , @xmath30 , @xmath153 ) .",
    "the initial ion temperature and density are kept constant at @xmath154 ( i.e. room temperature ) and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "the flow velocity of the ions outside the reconnection region has been analyzed , showing that the reconnection process can efficiently accelerate ions up to velocities comparable with the inflow alfvn speed @xmath39 even in laboratory conditions ( nearly @xmath156-@xmath157 ) .",
    "finally , the configuration resulting in the most promising acceleration has been simulated with a realistic mass ratio . from the analysis of the enegy budget shared during reconnection",
    ", we observe that nearly @xmath158 of the initial energy is given to particles , from which great part of it is subsequently converted into heat .",
    "after @xmath159 we observe a slightly increase in the magnetic field energy , which is thought to be caused by the formation of a secondary island . in correspondance of this increase , the total particles energy shows a mild drop , with most of this energy being thermal energy .",
    "interestingly , this simulation revealed the formation of a series of discontinuities over the reconnection outflow , as shown in figure [ fig : outflowanalysis ] .",
    "similar structures were observed in @xcite and @xcite and in relativistic simulations , which are believed to be shock structures .",
    "additional remarkable features are also observed , such as the series of complex structures visible between @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the left panel .",
    "although further investigation is required to fully understand their nature , we can already observe and quantify those dissipative mechanisms causing an increase in both temperature and entropy at the expenses of ions directional ( kinetic ) energy .",
    "the latter is further confirmed by the eulerian and lagrangian energy analysis , which show these two type of structures to increase the bulk and enthalpy energy flux at the expense of electromagnetic energy .",
    "similarly , the thermal energy equation in lagrangian frame mostly shows that an increase in enthalpy and velocity divergence is observed within these regions .",
    "finally , an important goal of this work was to figure out the potentiality of magnetic reconnection in accelerating particles for industrial and space propulsion purposes .",
    "such outcomes in the ion outflow velocity suggests possible applications in the domain of spacecraft propulsion . as such",
    ", a parameter similar to the one used in electric propulsion , i.e. the specific impulse @xmath103 , was taken as quality parameter .",
    "its average value across different simulation box cross sections is evaluated showing very interesting results .",
    "the maximum @xmath103 with a hydrogen plasma is as high as @xmath162 , attained at locations relatively far from the reconnection region and after reconnection is fully developed .    in conclusion , we argue that magnetic reconnection is surely worth being further studied in light of specific applications for particles acceleration .",
    "given its remarkable specific impulse , as well as the high velocity values reached in the outflow , this process appears to be suitable to applications like spacecraft propulsion and generation of ion beams .",
