    "after the discovery of the higgs boson - or several higgs bosons in extensions beyond the standard model ( sm ) - we have to probe its properties in order to establish the higgs mechanism @xcite as responsible for the creation of particle masses without violating gauge symmetry . in the sm the higgs mechanism is implemented by adding one isodoublet complex scalar field which leads after electroweak symmetry breaking to one single spin zero cp - even higgs particle @xcite . in extensions beyond the sm",
    "the higgs sector can be non - minimal , as _",
    "e.g. _ in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which contains five physical higgs states , _",
    "i.e. _ two cp - even @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one cp - odd @xmath3 and two charged @xmath4 higgs bosons @xcite . to establish the higgs mechanism",
    "experimentally we have to determine the higgs spin , its behavior under charge and parity transformations , the couplings to gauge bosons and fermions , and finally the trilinear and quartic higgs self - interactions must be measured to reconstruct the higgs potential itself . to fulfill this program the large hadron collider ( lhc ) analyses @xcite",
    "must be complemented by the high - precision measurements at a future international linear @xmath0 collider ( ilc ) @xcite . + we address in this contribution the determination of the higgs cp quantum numbers .",
    "to do so in an unambiguous way is somewhat problematic @xcite .",
    "observables sensitive to the higgs spin - parity such as angular correlations in higgs decays into @xmath5 pairs @xcite or in higgs production with or through these states @xcite only project out the cp - even component of the @xmath6 coupling , even in the presence of cp violation .",
    "in addition , the purely pseudoscalar @xmath7 coupling is zero at tree - level and is generated only through tiny loop corrections . in the higgs couplings to fermions , however , the cp - even and cp - odd components can have the same magnitude . here",
    ", the heaviest fermion discovered so far , the top quark , plays a special role .",
    "the @xmath8 coupling is largest being proportional to the top quark mass due to the higgs mechanism . at a future ilc the higgs boson",
    "can therefore be produced with sufficient rate in associated production with a @xmath9 pair , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we propose a simple and straightforward way to determine the cp nature of a sm - like higgs boson in this process , in an unambigious way , where we exploit that the cross section as well as the top quark polarization behave in a radically different way for cp - even and cp - odd higgs production .",
    "the diagrams which contribute in the sm to the process @xmath11 are shown in fig.[fig : diagrams ] . the bulk of the cross section is generated when the higgs is    r0.6        radiated off the heavy top quarks @xcite , whereas the higgs produced in association with a @xmath12 boson which then splits into a @xmath9 pair provides only a very small contribution , amounting to a few percent for @xmath13  tev detailed simulations have shown the cross section to be measurable with an accuracy of order 10% @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the case of a sm - like mixed cp higgs state @xmath14 and use the general form of the @xmath15 coupling @xmath16 where the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 are assumed to be real and @xmath19 . in the sm we have @xmath20 and for a purely pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath21 . in the pseudoscalar case we take @xmath22 , consistent with a convenient normalization @xmath23 chosen for the general case of a higgs boson with an indefinite cp quantum number .",
    "zero value for the product @xmath24 will hence signal cp violation in the higgs sector . for the @xmath25 coupling",
    ", we will use the form , @xmath26 and for the numerical analysis we chose @xmath27 @xcite as @xmath28 in the case of a cp - even ( odd ) higgs boson .",
    "we will thus have only one free parameter @xmath18 .",
    "however , this simple parametrization for a sm  like higgs need not be true in _ e.g. _ a general 2hdm , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are three independent parameters .",
    "we have calculated the cross section for the production of a mixed cp higgs state including the polarization dependence of the final state top quarks .",
    "the lengthy result has been checked to agree with ref .",
    "@xcite for the unpolarized total cross section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : totalcxn ] left panel we show the production cross section for a purely scalar ( @xmath2 with @xmath31 ) and a pseudoscalar ( @xmath3 with @xmath22 ) higgs as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy and for two mass values @xmath32 and @xmath33  gev .",
    "as can be inferred from the figure , the threshold rise of the cross section in the scalar and the pseudoscalar case is very different .",
    "furthermore , for the same strength of the @xmath34 couplings , there is an order of magnitude difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections at moderate energies . only at very high energies , @xmath35  tev ,",
    "the chiral limit is reached and the two cross sections become equal ,    r0.5        up to the small contribution due to the diagram including the @xmath25 coupling .",
    "these two features hence provide an extremely powerful tool to discriminate the cp properties of the spin zero particle produced together with the top quark pair .",
    "the difference in the threshold behavior of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 case is strong enough so that the cross section measurement at only two different c.m .",
    "energies allows a clear determination of the cp properties of the @xmath14 state .",
    "_ e.g. _ for @xmath36  gev , the ratio of the cross sections at @xmath37 and 500  gev is @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the scalar and pseudoscalar case , respectively .",
    "finally , taking the ratio makes the conclusion robust with respect to the effect of the top yukawa coupling , the higher order radiative corrections @xcite or systematic errors in the measurement .",
    "we also studied the @xmath18 dependence of the total @xmath15 production process at a given energy and for fixed @xmath40 .",
    "being a cp even quantity it only depends on @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig : totalcxn ] ( right ) shows the result for unpolarized and polarized @xmath42 beams . for the latter",
    ", we used the standard ilc values @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which double the total rate .",
    "since the top quark , due to its large decay width @xmath45  gev , decays much before hadronization , its spin information is translated to the decay distribution before contamination through strong interaction effects .",
    "furthermore , the lepton angular distribution of the decay @xmath46 is independent of any non - standard effects in the decay vertex , so that it is a pure probe of the physics of the top quark production process @xcite .",
    "the net polarization of the top quark therefore provides an interesting tool for the probe of @xmath18 , see also ref.@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : toppol ] ( left ) we show as a function of @xmath47 for @xmath36 and @xmath33  gev in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 case the expected degree of @xmath50-quark polarization @xmath51 , given by @xmath52 as can be inferred from the figure , the degree of top polarization is again strikingly different for the cp even and cp odd case and shows a very different threshold dependence .",
    "in addition , since @xmath51 is constructed as a ratio of cross sections , the insights gained from this variable are not affected by a possibly model dependent normalization of the overall @xmath53 coupling strength , higher order corrections etc .",
    "@xmath51 is a parity odd quantity and receives contributions from the interferences between the @xmath54 and all @xmath12 exchange diagrams , with the one stemming from the diagram involving the @xmath25 vertex being small .",
    "the parity violation effect for the emission of a ( pseudo)scalar is controlled by the ( vector ) axial - vector @xmath55 coupling ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the top isospin and    r0.5        @xmath59 the electric charge .",
    "hence the ratios of the @xmath51 values away from threshold are expected to be given by the @xmath60 , which indeed is confirmed by both figs .",
    "[ fig : toppol ] at @xmath37  gev .",
    "we investigate how the behavior of the cross section and the measurement of the top polarization , which both are clear discriminators between a scalar and pseudoscalar higgs state , can be used to get information on the cp mixing , _",
    "i.e. _ the value of @xmath18 . ignoring systematical errors , the sensitivity of an observable @xmath61 to the parameter @xmath18 at @xmath62 is @xmath63 , if @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the statistical fluctuation in @xmath66 at an integrated luminosity @xmath67 . for the cross section @xmath68 and the polarization @xmath51 , the statistical fluctuation at a level of confidence @xmath69",
    "are given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "[ fig : sens ] ( left ) shows the sensitivity @xmath63 from the cross section measurement for    r0.5        @xmath72  gev at @xmath37  gev with @xmath73  fb@xmath74 . for polarized @xmath42 beams it varies from 0.25 for @xmath48 to 0.01 for @xmath49 , a rather precise determination obtained from a simple measurement .",
    "the top polarization is less sensitive to @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] ( right ) .    both @xmath68 and @xmath51",
    "are cp even quantities , they can not depend linearly on @xmath18 and hence not probe cp violation directly",
    ". observables depending directly on the sine of the azimuthal angle ( @xmath14 ) are linear in @xmath18 .",
    "the up - down asymmetry @xmath75 of the antitop quark production with respect to the top - electron plane ( @xmath76 ) is an example of such an observable : @xmath77 with @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the @xmath80 momentum in the @xmath81-higgs rest frame .",
    "[ fig : udasy ] shows the asymmetry @xmath75 for a higgs boson of 120  gev and a c.m .",
    "energy of @xmath37  gev as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "it can reach values of order 5% .",
    "the non - zero value of the asymmetry arises from the channel which involves the @xmath25 coupling .",
    "we have shown that the total cross section and the top polarization asymmetry for associated higgs production with top quark pairs in @xmath0 collisions provide a very simple and unambiguous determination of the cp quantum numbers of a sm - like higgs particle . exploiting the up - down asymmetry of the anti - top with respect to the top - electron plane we further have a direct probe of cp violation at hand .",
