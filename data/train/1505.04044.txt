    "a condensed phase of matter , and its transition to a different one is sharply defined only in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite . yet , the mechanism driving the transition and the  phases \" can be discerned as a  crossover \"  @xcite even in a confined geometry with finite number of particles .",
    "such has been the scenario for the  melting \" of a wigner molecule ( wm )  @xcite  a puddle consisting of coulomb - interacting particles ( electrons ) . under the influence of thermal or quantum fluctuations ,",
    "a wm crosses over to a liquid - like phase .",
    "wm is a nano - scale version of two - dimensional ( 2d ) wigner crystal  @xcite , an insulating phase of a 2d electron solid whose non - conducting nature arises from the propensity of the electrons to localize as far apart from each other as possible ( consistent with their density ) minimizing the free energy .",
    "the study of the wigner molecules found a large scientific quest primarily with the advances in nano - technology .",
    "they are easily tunable using electrostatic and magnetic methods  @xcite employing non - invasive techniques .",
    "their importance in fundamental physics is crucial , providing a hotbed for studying the complex interplay of coulomb - repulsion , quantum interference effects in the confinement , level quantization due to their smallness , and finally , the disorder in the form of irregularities in the confinement geometry .",
    "the recent proposal of a insulator - metal transition in 2d electron gas ( with inherent disorder )  @xcite has renewed the interests for the study of `` disordered wigner melting ''  @xcite , because such transition is often attributed  @xcite to a melting of a wigner crystal or a wigner glass .",
    "disorder or impurities break all the spatial symmetries of the pure system reducing the ability of the particles to delocalize .",
    "there have been proposals for new and intervening phases  @xcite between the crystal and liquid .",
    "finally , the presence of disorder can change the nature and criticality of a transition  @xcite , and such modifications of wigner melting have not yet been looked into .",
    "overall , the complex interplay associated with such melting remains as one of the outstanding problems of condensed matter physics .",
    "seeking the physics of wigner melting in confined geometries has significant experimental relevance  @xcite in varied areas , such as , radio - frequency ion traps  @xcite , electrons on the surface of liquid he  @xcite , electrons in quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite , and in dusty plasmas  @xcite . unlike in the bulk system ,",
    "the long - range coulomb ( @xmath2 ) repulsion is poorly screened in a finite cluster .",
    "experimental clusters , such as large lateral quantum dots  @xcite often have inherent irregularities of the confinement , which are expected to act as disorder .",
    "this conjecture found support from the tunneling conductance measurements of chaotic dots  @xcite , and associated coulomb blockade experiments  @xcite .",
    "although a quantum melting of wigner - type in a circular trap has been studied extensively  @xcite , a similar study in the irregular confinement has not yet received as much attention , see however ref .",
    "recently , two of us reported the classical  melting \" of irregular wigner molecule ( iwm ) under the influence of thermal fluctuations  @xcite , devised criteria to quantify such crossover , and identified its mechanism in terms of defects .",
    "there are fundamental questions to address upon inclusion of quantum fluctuations in the form of zero - point motion .",
    "how different is the nature of such melting in a iwm from that in confinements with certain symmetries ?",
    "what roles do the defects play for such a quantum crossover ?",
    "finally , what would be the phase diagram in the plane of thermal and quantum fluctuations ? addressing such questions in the present paper , we list below our main findings :    \\(1 ) the symmetry of the confinement does not control the  solid \" to  liquid \" crossover scale in wm , neither does it influence the underlying  melting \" mechanism .",
    "\\(2 ) the crossover turns out to be unique irrespective of the used distinct criteria for `` melting '' .",
    "\\(3 ) the phase diagram consists of three phases : _ a classical liquid _ , _ wigner molecule _ and _ a quantum liquid _ along with intriguing _ re - entrant solidification _ with increasing temperature in the extreme quantum regime .",
    "\\(4 ) the crossover in the traps with spatial symmetries indicates that in the thermodynamic limit the quantum melting is likely to be of first order with the characteristic discontinuity in the observables .",
    "the weaker melting in an irregular confinement is more subtle for predicting thermodynamic limit .",
    "the thermal melting , on the other hand , follows the disclination mediated kthny mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model , the parameter space and the simulation method used to study both quantum and classical systems . in section iii",
    ", we present our main results .",
    "the corresponding subsections include the comparison of several melting criteria , the reconstructed diagram and the discussion of the melting mechanism .",
    "our model of wm consists of @xmath3 distinguishable particles ( boltzmannons ) in 2d plane and interacting via long - range coulomb repulsion .",
    "these particles are trapped by an external potential @xmath4 . for much of our calculations",
    "we compare results from three confinements : ( a ) circular , @xmath5 , ( b ) elliptic , @xmath6 and ( c ) irregular , @xmath7 , given by , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the confinement strengths @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 controls the average particle density in these traps . because we expect the @xmath7 to mimic the universal features of disordered systems , it is designed to break all the spatial symmetries .",
    "for example , @xmath14 breaks the @xmath15-@xmath16 symmetry while @xmath17 introduces chaoticity and @xmath18 breaks reflection symmetry .",
    "appropriate values for parameters representing universal disorder physics are found in literature  @xcite .",
    "while disorder is typically introduced in bulk systems by random impurities , they originate in a confined system with small number of particles from the irregularities at the ` soft ' boundary which are relevant for experiments in which the external confinement is set up by electrostatic and magnetic means  @xcite .",
    "the ensemble of particles in this potential will be referenced below as iwm .    in case of a harmonic trap ,",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath19 + \\sum_{i < j}^n \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon|{\\bf r}_{i}-{\\bf r}_{j}|},\\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the effective mass and the dielectric constant of the medium , respectively .",
    "next , we introduce the length and energy scales @xmath22 and @xmath23 , specified by @xmath24 and @xmath25 . after the scaling transformation @xmath26 and @xmath27 eq .",

    "the analogy to the bulk in deciding the quantum parameter is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 specifies the average electron density , see eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of  ( [ h1 ] ) have been studied in the canonical ensemble ( fixed particle number @xmath3 and temperature @xmath33 ) .    the potentials @xmath5 and @xmath6 are quadratic in @xmath34 , whereas , the @xmath7 has quartic dependence . to match the dimensions of three potentials , we rescale the strength of the irregular potential as @xmath35 .",
    "this rescaling ensures that @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be treated as dimensionless parameters , whereas the definition of the quantum parameter @xmath37 , being the pre - factor in the kinetic energy term , remains the same for all the three confinements .",
    "the thermal melting of an irregular wigner molecule has already been studied in detail  @xcite . in the current study we focus on the effect of quantum fluctuations ( by varying @xmath37 ) .",
    "temperature @xmath1 is kept fixed at a low value , corresponding to the solid phase in the classical regime . by increasing @xmath37",
    "we induce quantum melting in all the three confinements .",
    "the quantum @xmath3-particle system  ( [ h1 ] ) can be analyzed by first principle simulations using the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique  @xcite .",
    "the particle statistics is limited to `` boltzmannons '' ( no exchange ) to distinguish the effects related with the disorder and quantum statistics . in the path integral representation",
    "the @xmath3-particle density matrix is mapped on that of a classical system of interacting `` polymers '' .",
    "particles are represented by the trajectories which evolve in the imaginary time @xmath38 , with the upper bound specified by the inverse temperature @xmath39 .",
    "number of time - slices @xmath40 changes with @xmath41 and the quantum parameter @xmath37 by the relation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is an integer in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 to reach convergence in the energy better than @xmath46 . in most of our simulations",
    "we use @xmath47 independent of temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the ensemble averages have been estimated over @xmath48 independent realizations of particle trajectories efficiently sampled via the bisection algorithm  @xcite .",
    "complementary , the classical counterpart has been studied by standard simulated annealing monte carlo ( mc ) scheme  @xcite based on the metropolis algorithm  @xcite . in the simulated annealing schedule",
    "we start from higher @xmath1 and anneal down to the desired @xmath1 to track the appropriate low energy states .",
    "it is important to note , that the identification of the melting transition in the case of irregular traps  @xcite filled with quantum particles is more complicated compared with the classical clusters formed in circular symmetric potentials .",
    "the latter have been successfully studied via the modified lindemann - based  @xcite parameters , the orientational and radial correlation functions which take into account coexistence of two different types of symmetries , i.e. ordering into a triangular - lattice structure ( with hexagonal symmetry ) in the bulk of the cluster and a shell - structure in the boundary region  @xcite , as wells as possible radial inhomogeneity of the onset of melting .",
    "in contrast , the onset of melting in quantum clusters will be significantly masked by the zero - point fluctuations .",
    "in particular , the lindemann - based parameters and the correlation functions in quantum solids at @xmath49 get a significant background shift related with the quantum mechanical uncertainty in the particle position . as an example",
    ", the critical value of the lindemann parameter at the solid - liquid quantum transition  @xcite ( @xmath49 ) is increased to @xmath50 from its original value @xmath51 valid for classical solids .",
    "similar observations hold for finite quantum clusters  @xcite . the combined effect of quantum fluctuations and the order - disorder transition is even more difficult to distinguish in small systems ( @xmath52 ) where a sharp transition is replaced by a crossover behavior .",
    "partially to overcome this problem in the present studies , we measure the order parameters characterizing the `` solid phase '' in two different ways .",
    "first , by taking the ensemble average over particle configurations on every imaginary time slice .",
    "this is called _ bead - by - bead _ ( bb ) distribution and corresponds to the correct quantum mechanical average .",
    "second , we exclude the zero - point fluctuations related with the delocalization of quantum particles and address the _ bead - centroid _ ( bc ) positions during the imaginary time evolution @xmath53    the physical picture is captured the bb - distribution as it takes into account the wave function overlap .",
    "the bc - distribution , instead , is more suited to describe different structural symmetries , cf . relative particle positions on the shells , and corresponds to the semi - classical picture .",
    "the bc - picture also depicts the evolution of particles in the configuration space , while the bb the combined evolution including the imaginary time .",
    "because bc - calculations provide a semi - classical interpretation for the quantum effects , it is useful for the comparison between the classical and its corresponding quantum counterpart .",
    "both pictures are necessary to fully understand different melting criteria introduced below .",
    "in our studies we mainly concentrate on the system with @xmath54 particles . in the case of circular potential",
    "it is called _ magic cluster _ as the hexagonal symmetry dominates over the full structure  @xcite . in irregular and elliptical case ,",
    "no such concept as a magic cluster exists .",
    "next , we should address the question : which parameter needs to be fixed to compare melting in three different traps on equal grounds ?",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is inversely proportional to @xmath22 , the spacing between two nearest neighbors .",
    "we tune the trap parameters ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the elliptical trap , and @xmath57 in the irregular one ) to make @xmath22 equal in the three cases .",
    "this results in the same average density . to do this , we compare the coordinate @xmath22 for the ground state of two particles obtained by minimizing the potential for the different traps .",
    "the trap parameters found by this procedure are : @xmath58 in case of _ irregular _ , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 in case of _ elliptical _ potential .",
    "the other parameters for the _ irregular _ trap are similar to those used in ref .",

    "the left column presents an example of melting by thermal fluctuations ( the quantum parameter has the smallest value @xmath64 ) . here , fluctuations are nearly frozen at low @xmath1 and @xmath37 and individual particles are resolved as bright spots in the density profile ( though certain particles show quantum signature through a spread in their wave functions ) . with the increase in @xmath1 ,",
    "particle delocalization occurs in two ways : ( a ) thermal diffusion of particles around their equilibrium position , and ( b ) the thermal fluctuations create occasional long and string - like paths of delocalization , whose role on the crossover is already discussed in the literature  @xcite . moving along a row , ( say , the one corresponding to @xmath68 ) , the strength of the quantum fluctuation increases and the corresponding crossover occurs primarily by the spreading of wave functions of the individual particles . we found no additional ` string - like paths ' upon increasing @xmath37 . however , such paths , once developed for @xmath69 , survive quantum fluctuations up to a large @xmath37 and the melting becomes complete when such paths can not be resolved from the spread of particles wave function .",

    "such a collective motion across the crossover also occurs for the circular and elliptic traps , however , the paths are less rambling and follow the underlying confinement symmetry .",

    "confinements with or without spatial symmetries leave signatures somewhat differently on the crossover from _ wigner _ molecule to liquid - like phase",

    "the critical value , @xmath190 , found for the quantum melting of a 2d coulomb bulk system of boltzmannons  @xcite is close to the upper bound of the crossover region .",
    "a lower crossover scale for a trap than the bulk critical value is expected  @xcite , because the loss of translational symmetry in traps reduces the ability for the particles to delocalize and the resulting ` solid ' survives up to a smaller @xmath32 .    our detailed analyses of melting in the irregular confinement allowed us to reconstruct a precise phase diagram which shows several phases : a ) thermal quasi - classical liquid , b ) _ wigner _ solid and c ) quantum liquid . here",

    "this neglects quantum statistics effects of fermions or bosons .",
    "however , in the crystal phase where particles are strongly localized , these effects are expected to be small  @xcite . in particular , the suppression of the fermi liquid behavior by the strong interactions is well - known in the @xmath192he system  @xcite .",

    "@xmath193he systems long exchanges of indistinguishable bosons play an important role in the stabilizing the superfluid phase  @xcite .",

    "it is indeed reassuring that the phase boundary produced by independent criteria match reasonably well within the statistical errors .",
    "we have uncovered a new feature in the phase diagram for the irregular trap in the form of the _ re - entrant _ solidification or the weakening of liquidity upon increasing temperature in the quantum regime .",
    "identification of such a phenomenon would be an intriguing experimental proposition .",
    "the quantum crossover is associated with a sharply increasing defect fraction ( disclination ) in the region around @xmath0 .",
    "the sharpness in the proliferation of defects is weaker in the irregular trap , however , the presence of spatial symmetries in case of circular or elliptic confinements strengthens such sharpness hinting that the crossover turns into a first order transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless , our extrapolation based on a small system can hardly differentiate between a weakly first order and nearly second order transitions .",
    "they pose serious numerical challenges even for a bulk system .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding classical transition is governed by the kthny physics .",

    "<S> this is because the zero - point motion screens the boundary effects within short distances . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram as a function of thermal and quantum fluctuations determined from independent criteria is unique , and shows ` melting ' from the wm to both the classical and quantum  liquids \" . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing signature of weakening liquidity with increasing temperature , @xmath1 , is found in the extreme quantum regime . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover is associated with production of defects . </S>",
