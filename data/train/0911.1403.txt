    "an unsatisfactory feature of all theories of gravity is that the field equations do not have any direct physical interpretation .",
    "the lack of an elegant principle which can lead to the dynamics of gravity ( `` how matter tells spacetime to curve '' ) is quite striking when we compare this situation with the kinematics of gravity ( `` how spacetime makes the matter move '' ) .",
    "the latter can be determined through the principle of equivalence by demanding that all freely falling observers , at all events in spacetime , must find that the equations of motion for matter reduce to their special relativistic form .",
    "our first aim will be to remedy this and provide a physical interpretation to field equations describing gravity in any diffeomorphism invariant theory .",
    "this , in turn , will lead us to the possibility of _ deriving _ the gravitational field equations from a thermodynamic variational principle without using the metric as a dynamical variable .",
    "the alternative interpretation is based on the thermodynamics of horizons .",
    "several recent investigations have shown that there is indeed a deep connection between gravitational dynamics and horizon thermodynamics ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , studies have shown that :    * gravitational field equations in _ a wide variety of theories _ , when evaluated on a horizon , reduce to a thermodynamic identity @xmath0 .",
    "this result , first pointed out in ref.@xcite , has now been demonstrated @xcite in several cases like the stationary axisymmetric horizons and evolving spherically symmetric horizons in einstein gravity , static spherically symmetric horizons and dynamical apparent horizons in lovelock gravity , and three dimensional btz black hole horizons , frw cosmological models in various gravity theories and even @xcite in the case horava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "it is not possible to understand , in the conventional approach , why the field equations should encode information about horizon thermodynamics .",
    "* gravitational action functionals in a wide class of theories have a a surface term and a bulk term . in the conventional approach ,",
    "we _ ignore _ the surface term completely ( or cancel it with a counter - term ) and obtain the field equation from the bulk term in the action .",
    "any solution to the field equation obtained by this procedure is logically independent of the nature of the surface term .",
    "but when the _ surface term _ ( which was ignored ) is evaluated at the horizon that arises in any given solution , it gives the entropy of the horizon !",
    "( again , this result extends far beyond einstein s theory to situations in which the entropy is not just proportional to horizon area .",
    ") this is possible only because there is a specific holographic relationship @xcite between the surface term and the bulk term which , however , is an unexplained feature in the conventional approach to gravitational dynamics . since the surface term has the thermodynamic interpretation as the entropy of horizons , and is related holographically to the bulk term , we are again led to an indirect connection between spacetime dynamics and horizon thermodynamics .",
    "based on these features  _ which have no explanation in the conventional approach _",
    " one can argue that there is a conceptual reason why we need to relate horizon thermodynamics with gravitational dynamics ( in a wide class of theories far more general than just einstein gravity ) and revise our perspective towards spacetime . to set the stage for this future discussion , we begin by recalling the implications of the existence of temperature for horizons .    in the study of normal macroscopic systems  like , for example , a solid or a gas",
    " one can _ deduce _ the existence of microstructure just from the fact that the object can be heated .",
    "this was the insight of boltzmann which led him to suggest that heat is essentially a form of motion of the microscopic constituents of matter .",
    "that is , the existence of temperature is sufficient for us to infer the existence of microstructure even without any direct experimental evidence .",
    "the non - zero temperature of a horizon shows that we can actually heat up a spacetime , just as one can heat up a solid or a gas . an unorthodox way of doing this would be to take some amount of matter and arrange it to collapse and form a black hole .",
    "the hawking radiation @xcite emitted by the black hole can be used to heat up , say , a pan of water just as though the pan was kept inside a microwave oven .",
    "in fact the same result can be achieved by just accelerating through the inertial vacuum carrying the pan of water which will eventually be heated to a temperature proportional to the acceleration @xcite .",
    "these processes show that the temperatures of all horizons are as real as any other temperature @xcite .",
    "since they give rise to a class of hot spacetimes , it follows _  la _ boltzmann that the spacetimes should possess microstructure .    in the case of a solid or gas , we know the nature of this microstructure from atomic and molecular physics .",
    "hence , in principle , we can work out the thermodynamics of these systems from the underlying statistical mechanics .",
    "this is not possible in the case of spacetime because we have no clue about its microstructure .",
    "however , one of the remarkable features of thermodynamics  in contrast to statistical mechanics  is that the thermodynamic description is fairly insensitive to the details of the microstructure and can be developed as a fairly broad frame work .",
    "for example , a thermodynamic identity like @xmath1 has a universal validity and the information about a _ given _ system is only encoded in the form of the entropy functional @xmath2 . in the case of normal materials ,",
    "this entropy arises because of our coarse graining over microscopic degrees of freedom which are not tracked in the dynamical evolution . in the case of spacetime",
    ", the existence of horizons for a particular class of observers makes it mandatory that these observers integrate out degrees of freedom hidden by the horizon .    to make this notion clearer ,",
    "let us start from the principle of equivalence which allows one to construct local inertial frames ( lif ) with coordinates @xmath3 , around any event in an arbitrary curved spacetime .",
    "given the lif , we can now construct a local rindler frame ( lrf ) by boosting along one of the directions with an acceleration @xmath4 , thereby locally transforming the metric to a form given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the observers at rest ( with @xmath8 constant ) in the lrf will perceive the @xmath9 null surface as a horizon @xmath10 ( fig 1 ) .",
    "these local rindler observers and the freely falling inertial observers will attribute different thermodynamical properties to matter in the spacetime .",
    "for example , they will attribute different temperatures and entropies to the vacuum state as well as excited states of matter fields .",
    "when some matter with energy @xmath11 moves close to the horizon  say , within a few planck lengths because it formally takes infinite rindler time for matter to actually cross @xmath10  the local rindler observer will consider it to have transfered an entropy @xmath12 to the horizon degrees of freedom .",
    "we will show ( in sec .",
    "3 ) that , when the metric satisfies the field equations of any diffeomorphism invariant theory , this transfer of entropy can be given @xcite a geometrical interpretation as the change in the entropy of the horizon .",
    "this result allows us to associate an entropy functional with the null surfaces which the local rindler observers perceive as horizons .",
    "we can now demand that the sum of the horizon entropy and the entropy of matter that flows across the horizons ( both as perceived by the local rindler observers ) , should be an extremum for all observers in the spacetime .",
    "this leads to a constraint on the geometry of spacetime which can be stated , in @xmath13 , as @xmath14 for all null vectors @xmath15 in the spacetime .",
    "the general solution to is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 has to be a constant because of the conditions @xmath18 .",
    "hence the thermodynamic principle leads uniquely to einstein s equation with a cosmological constant in 4-dimensions .",
    "notice , however , that has a new symmetry which the standard einstein s theory does not posses ; viz . , it is invariant under the transformation @xmath19 .",
    "this has important implications for the cosmological constant problem which we will discuss in sec .",
    "4.3 . in @xmath20",
    ", the same entropy maximization leads to a more general class of theories called lanczos - lovelock  models ( see sec",
    ". 4.2 ) .    the constraint on the background geometry in arises from our demand that the thermodynamic extremum principle should hold for _ all _ local rindler observers .",
    "this is identical to the manner in which freely falling observers are used to determine how gravitational field influences matter .",
    "demanding the validity of special relativistic laws for the matter variables , as determined by all the freely falling observers , allows us to determine the influence of gravity on matter . in a similar manner ,",
    "demanding the maximization of entropy of horizons ( plus matter ) , as measured by all local rindler observers , leads to the dynamical equations of gravity .    in this approach",
    ", both the entropy of horizons as well as the entropy of matter flowing across the horizon will be observer dependent thereby introducing a new level of observer dependence in thermodynamics .",
    "in particular , observers in different states of motion will have different regions of spacetime accessible to them ; for example , an observer falling into a black hole will not perceive its horizon in the same manner as an observer who is orbiting around it .",
    "therefore we are forced to accept that the notion of entropy is an observer dependent concept .",
    "( at a conceptual level this is no different from the fact different freely falling observers will measure physical quantities differently ; but in this case , standard rules of special relativity allow us to translate the results between the observers .",
    "we do not yet have a similar set of rules for quantum field theory in noninertial frames . )",
    "all these features suggest a deep relationship between quantum theory , thermodynamics and gravity which forms the main theme of this article .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows : in the next section , i briefly review some of the background results needed for our discussion .",
    "section 3 describes an interpretation of gravitational field equations in a general , diffeomorphism invariant , theory of gravity .",
    "using these results , it is possible to introduce an entropy maximization principle from which one can obtain the same field equations without using the metric as a dynamical variable .",
    "this is done in sec . 4 and the last section summarizes the results .",
    "we begin by summarizing some of the standard results we will need later on . in particular , we will briefly review : ( i ) the field equations in a general class of theories of gravity as well as ( ii ) the relation between noether charge and gravitational entropy of horizons .      consider a theory for gravity described by the metric @xmath21 coupled to matter with some degrees of freedom generally denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "we will take the action describing such a theory in @xmath23dimensions to be @xmath24 \\label{genact}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is some scalar built from metric and curvature and @xmath26 is the matter lagrangian depending on the metric and matter variables @xmath22 .",
    "( we have assumed that @xmath27 does not involve derivatives of curvature tensor , to simplify the discussion . ) varying @xmath28 in this action with suitable boundary conditions , we will get the equations of motion ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30    when @xmath31 these field equations describe a class of theories , called the lanczos - lovelock  theories which have very interesting geometrical features @xcite . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath32 the crucial difference between and is that , the @xmath33 in contains no derivatives of the metric higher than second order thereby leading to field equations which are second order in the metric .",
    "in contrast , can contain up to fourth order derivatives of the metric .",
    "the lagrangians which lead to the constraint @xmath34 and hence to are , of course , quite special .",
    "they can be written as a sum of terms , each involving products of curvature tensors with the @xmath35th term being a product of @xmath36 curvature tensors . the general lanczos - lovelock  lagrangian has the form , @xmath37 where the @xmath38 are arbitrary constants and @xmath39  is the @xmath36-th order lanczos - lovelock  lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath40 term is proportional to @xmath41 and leads to einstein s theory .",
    "it is conventional to take @xmath42 so that the @xmath43 , reduces to @xmath44 .",
    "the normalizations for @xmath45 are somewhat arbitrary for individual @xmath39  since the @xmath38s are unspecified at this stage .",
    "the @xmath46 term gives rise to what is known as gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "because of the determinant tensor , it is obvious that in any given dimension @xmath47 we can only have @xmath48 terms where @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that , if @xmath13 , then only the @xmath50 are non - zero . of these",
    ", the gauss - bonnet term ( corresponding to @xmath46 ) gives , on variation of the action , a vanishing bulk contribution in @xmath13 .",
    "( in dimensions @xmath51 to 8 , one can have both the einstein - hilbert term and the gauss - bonnet term and so on . )      since our aim is to provide a thermodynamic interpretation of the field equations in , we first need an expression for horizon entropy in this theory",
    ". this has been already obtained by wald @xcite but we will introduce it in a manner appropriate for our purpose .    in any generally covariant theory ,",
    "the infinitesimal coordinate transformations @xmath52 lead to conservation of a noether current that can be obtained as follows : the variation of the gravitational lagrangian resulting from arbitrary variations of @xmath53 generically has to a surface term and hence can be expressed in the form , @xmath54 when the variations in @xmath53 arise through the diffeomorphism @xmath55 we have , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . substituting these in and using the ( generalized ) bianchi identity @xmath58",
    ", we obtain the conservation law @xmath59 , for the current , @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the boundary term which arises for the specific variation of the metric in the form @xmath62 ) .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the antisymmetric tensor @xmath63 by @xmath64 . using the known expression for @xmath65 in ,",

    "these expressions simplify significantly at any event @xmath70 where @xmath71 behaves like an ( approximate ) killing vector and satisfies the conditions @xmath72 ( which a true killing vector will satisfy everywhere ) .",
    "then one can easily prove that @xmath73 at the event @xmath70 ; the expression for noether current simplifies considerably and is given by @xmath74    by considering physical processes involving horizons , it can be shown that the first law of black hole dynamics , for example , is consistent with the identification of the following expression as the horizon entropy : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the temperature of the horizon . in the final expression in the integral",

    "the area element on the horizon can be taken to be @xmath80 with @xmath81 being an auxiliary vector field satisfying the condition @xmath82 .",
    "then the integral in reduces to @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the horizon area .",
    "( we have used the relations @xmath85 and the fact that @xmath71 is a killing vector . ) this result , of course , agrees with the standard one .",
    "the expression for entropy in allows one to interpret @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the appropriately redshifted local temperature near the horizon , as an entropy density associated with the horizon .",
    "this is the interpretation which we will exploit in what follows .",
    "with this background , we are now in a position to provide a thermodynamic interpretation for the gravitational field equations in the local rindler frames ( lrfs ) around any event .",
    "we will do this in a manner analogous to the way we use the freely falling observers to determine the kinematics of gravity . at every event in spacetime",
    ", we will introduce local rindler observers and use the horizon thermodynamics perceived by these rindler observers to constrain the background geometry .",
    "we shall begin by making the notion of local rindler observers and their coordinate systems well defined .",
    "let us choose any event @xmath70 and introduce a local inertial frame ( lif ) around it with riemann normal coordinates @xmath88 such that @xmath70 has the coordinates @xmath89 in the lif .",
    "let @xmath90 be a future directed null vector at @xmath70 and we align the coordinates of lif such that @xmath90 lies in the @xmath91 plane at @xmath70 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we next transform from the lif to a local rindler frame ( lrf ) coordinates @xmath92 by accelerating along the x - axis with an acceleration @xmath4 by the usual transformation .",
    "the metric near the origin now reduces to the form in where ( @xmath93 ) are the coordinates of lrf .",
    "let @xmath71 be the approximate killing vector corresponding to translation in the rindler time such that the vanishing of @xmath94 characterizes the location of the local horizon @xmath10 in lrf .",
    "usually , we shall do all the computation on a timelike surface infinitesimally away from @xmath10 with @xmath95 constant , usually called a `` stretched horizon '' . let the timelike unit normal to the stretched horizon be @xmath96 .",
    "this lrf ( with metric in ) and its local horizon @xmath10 will exist within a region of size @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 is a typical component of curvature tensor of the background spacetime ) as long as @xmath99 .",
    "this condition can always be satisfied by taking a sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "essentially , the introduction of the lrf uses the fact that we have two length scales in the problem at any event .",
    "first is the length scale @xmath100 associated with the curvature components of the background metric over which we have no control .",
    "the second is the length scale @xmath101 associated with the accelerated trajectory which we can choose .",
    "hence we can always ensure that @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , this is clearly seen in the euclidean sector in which the horizon maps to the origin ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the locally flat frame in the euclidean sector will exist in a region of radius @xmath100 while the trajectory of a uniformly accelerated observer will be a circle of radius @xmath101 .",
    "hence one can always keep the latter inside the former . in the euclidean sector",
    "the rindler observer s trajectory is a circle of radius @xmath101 which can be made arbitrarily close to the origin .",
    "suppose the observer s trajectory has the usual form @xmath102 which is maintained for a time interval of the order of @xmath103 .",
    "then , the trajectory will complete a full circle _ in the euclidean sector _",
    "irrespective of what happens later .",
    "when we work in the limit of @xmath104 , this becomes arbitrarily local in both space _ and _ time .",
    "the metric in is just the metric of the locally flat region in polar coordinates .",
    "more generally , one can choose a trajectory @xmath105 such that its acceleration @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 is the time - like four velocity ) satisfies the condition @xmath108 . in a suitably chosen lif this trajectory will reduce to the standard hyperbola of a uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "this construction also defines local rindler horizons around any event .",
    "further , the local temperature on the stretched horizon will be @xmath109 so that @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "the local rindler observers will view the thermodynamics of matter around them very differently from the freely falling observers ( we will say more about this later on in sec . 3.3 ) .",
    "in particular , they will attribute a loss of entropy @xmath12 when matter with an amount of energy @xmath11 gets close to the horizon ( within a few planck lengths , say ) . in the rindler frame",
    "the appropriate energy - momentum density is @xmath112 .",
    "( it is the integral of @xmath113 that gives the rindler hamiltonian @xmath114 , which leads to evolution in rindler time @xmath115 and appears in the thermal density matrix @xmath116 . )",
    "a local rindler observer , moving along the orbits of the killing vector field @xmath71 with four velocity @xmath117 , will associate an energy @xmath118 with a proper volume @xmath119 .",
    "if this energy gets transfered across the horizon , the corresponding entropy transfer will be @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the local ( redshifted ) temperature of the horizon and @xmath122 is the lapse function .",
    "since @xmath123 , we find that @xmath124 consider now the gravitational entropy associated with the local horizon . from the discussion of noether charge as horizon entropy [ see ] , we know that @xmath125 , associated with the ( approximate ) killing vector @xmath71 , can be thought of as local entropy current .",
    "therefore , @xmath126 can be interpreted as the gravitational entropy associated with a volume @xmath119 as measured by an observer with four - velocity @xmath127 .",
    "( the conservation of @xmath66 ensures that there is no irreversible entropy production or dissipation in the spacetime . )",
    "since @xmath71 satisfies locally , it follows that @xmath128 giving the current to be @xmath129 . for observers moving along the orbits of the killing vector @xmath71 with @xmath117 we get @xmath130\\ , dv_{\\rm prop}\\ ] ] as one",

    "this is equivalent to @xmath141 with some constant @xmath142 .",
    "( the constancy of @xmath142 follows from the conditions @xmath143 . )",
    "this provides a purely thermodynamical interpretation of the field equations of any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity .",
    "note that is not quite the same as the standard equation in because has an extra symmetry which standard gravitational field equations do not have : these equations are invariant under the shift @xmath144 with some constant @xmath145 .",
    "( this symmetry has important implications @xcite for cosmological constant problem which we will discuss in sec .",
    "4.3 . ) while the properties of lrf are relevant conceptually to define the intermediate notions ( local killing vector , horizon temperature .... ) , the essential result is independent of these notions . _ just as we introduce local inertial frames to decide how gravity couples to matter , we use local rindler frames to interpret the physical content of the field equations . _    in the above interpretation we used the local , conserved , current @xmath66 . to understand why this is to be expected for consistency , recall that we have crucially used the `` democracy of all observers '' in demanding entropy balance to hold for all observers .",
    "the mathematical content of this active version of general covariance is captured by the diffeomorphism invariance of the underlying theory which determines the dynamics of the spacetime . because the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory forced us to treat all observers at an equal footing",
    ", the diffeomorphism invariance must also lead to the conserved current @xmath66 .",
    "we have already seen that this is the case .",
    "the expression for the noether current is not unique in the sense that one can add to it any term of the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 is an anti - symmetric tensor thereby ensuring @xmath148 .",
    "this ambiguity has been extensively discussed in the literature but for providing the thermodynamic interpretation to the field equations , we have ignored this ambiguity and used the expression in .",
    "there are several reasons why the ambiguity is irrelevant for our purpose .",
    "first , in a truly thermodynamic approach , one specifies the system by specifying a thermodynamic potential , say , the entropy functional . in a local description",
    ", this translates into specifying the entropy current which determines the theory .",
    "so it is perfectly acceptable to make a specific choice for @xmath66 consistent with the symmetries of the problem .",
    "second , we shall often be interested in theories in which the equations of motion are no higher than second order . in these ( so called lanczos - lovelock  models ) it is not natural to add any extra term to the noether current such that it is linear in @xmath71 as we approach the horizon with a coefficient determined entirely from metric and curvature .",
    "finally , we shall obtain in sec .",
    "4 the field equation from maximizing an entropy functional where this ambiguity will not arise .",
    "once we realize that the real physical meaning of the field equations is contained in , it is possible to re - interpret these equations in several alternative ways all of which have the same physical content .",
    "we shall mention two of them .",
    "consider an observer who sees some matter energy flux crossing the horizon .",
    "let @xmath96 be the spacelike unit normal to the stretched horizon @xmath149 , pointing in the direction of increasing @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath71 is the approximate , timelike killing vector corresponding to rindler time , then the energy flux through a patch of stretched horizon with normal @xmath96 will be @xmath151 and the associated entropy flux will be @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the local temperature .",
    "we require this entropy flux must match the entropy change of the locally perceived horizon .",
    "the gravitational entropy current is given by @xmath154 , such that @xmath155 gives the corresponding gravitational entropy flux .",
    "so we require @xmath156 to hold at all events .",
    "the product @xmath157 for the vector @xmath158 , which satisfies @xmath159 on the stretched horizon is @xmath160 .",
    "hence we get @xmath161 as @xmath162 and the stretched horizon approaches the local horizon and @xmath163 approaches @xmath135 ( which in turn is proportional to @xmath164 ) so that @xmath165 .",
    "so , as we approach the horizon we obtain",
    ".    there is another way of interpreting this result which will be useful for further generalizations . instead of allowing matter to flow across the horizon",
    ", one could have equally well considered a virtual , infinitesimal ( planck scale ) , displacement of the @xmath10 normal to itself engulfing some matter .",
    "we only need to consider infinitesimal displacements because the entropy of the matter is not ` lost ' until it crosses the horizon ; that is , until when the matter is at an infinitesimal distance ( a few planck lengths ) from the horizon . hence an infinitesimal displacement of @xmath10 normal to itself will engulf some matter .",
    "some entropy will be again lost to the outside observers unless displacing a piece of local rindler horizon itself costs some entropy .",
    "we , therefore , expect the entropy balance condition derived earlier to ensure this and indeed it does .",
    "an infinitesimal displacement of a local patch of the stretched horizon in the direction of @xmath96 , by an infinitesimal proper distance @xmath166 , will change the proper volume by @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the metric in the transverse space . the flux of energy through the surface will be @xmath169 and the corresponding entropy flux",
    "can be obtained by multiplying the energy flux by @xmath170 .",
    "hence the ` loss ' of matter entropy to the outside observer because the virtual displacement of the horizon has engulfed some matter is @xmath171 . to find the change in the gravitational entropy , we again use the noether current @xmath66 corresponding to the local killing vector @xmath71 .",
    "multiplying by @xmath158 and @xmath110 , we get @xmath172 as the stretched horizon approaches the true horizon , @xmath173 and @xmath174 making the last term vanish .",
    "so the condition @xmath175 leads to @xmath176 which is again the same as .",
    "obviously , there are many other equivalent ways of presenting this result .      as an aside",
    ", we shall comment on some new conceptual issues brought about by the existence of horizons and entropy which are relevant in this context .",
    "we recall that the mathematical formulation leading to the association of temperature with any horizon is fairly universal and it does not distinguish between different horizons , like for example rindler horizon in flat space or a schwarzschild black hole event horizon or a de sitter horizon @xcite .",
    "assuming that temperature and entropy arise for fundamentally the same reason , it would be extremely unnatural _ not _ to associate entropy with all horizons .",
    "this feature , however , brings in a new layer of observer dependent thermodynamics into the theory which  though it need not come as a surprise  has to be tackled . we know",
    "that while an inertial observer will attribute zero temperature and zero entropy to the inertial vacuum , a rindler observer will attribute a finite temperature and non - zero ( formally divergent ; ` entanglement ' ) entropy to the same vacuum state .",
    "_ so entropy is indeed an observer dependent concept .",
    "_ when one does quantum field theory in curved spacetime , it is not only that particles become an observer dependent notion so do the temperature and entropy .",
    "this notion can be made more quantitative as follows :    consider an excited state of a quantum field with energy @xmath11 above the ground state as specified in an inertial frame .",
    "when we integrate out the unobservable modes for the rindler observer in this state , we will get a density matrix @xmath177 and the corresponding entropy will be @xmath178 .",
    "the inertial vacuum state has the density matrix @xmath17 and the entropy @xmath179 .",

    "temperature @xmath190 rather than the horizon temperature @xmath191 .",
    "but the correct expression is @xmath192 ; the horizon acts as a system with some internal degrees of freedom and temperature @xmath191 _ as far as rindler observer is concerned _ so that when one adds an energy @xmath11 to it , the entropy change is @xmath193 . obviously , a rindler observer ( or an observer at rest just outside a black hole horizon ) will attribute all these entropy changes to the horizon she perceives while an inertial observer ( or an observer falling through the schwarzschild horizon ) will see none of these phenomena .",
    "this requires us to accept the fact that many thermodynamic phenomena needs to be now thought of as specifically observer dependent .",
    "for example , if we drop some hot matter into a schwarzschild black hole , then , when it gets to a few planck lengths away from the horizon it would interact with the microscopic horizon degrees of freedom _ as far as an outside observer is concerned_. a freely falling observer through the horizon will have a completely different picture .",
    "we have learnt to live with this dichotomy as far as elementary kinematics goes ; we now need to do the same as regards thermodynamics and quantum processes .    as far as an outside observer is concerned",
    ", matter takes an infinite amount of coordinate time to cross the horizon .",
    "however , this is irrelevant from a practical point of view .",
    "we have , for example , considerable evidence of very different nature to suggest planck length acts as lower bound to the length scales that can be operationally defined and that no measurements can be ultra sharp at planck scales @xcite .",
    "so one can not really talk about the location of the event horizon ignoring fluctuations of this order .",
    "hence from the operational point of view , we only need to consider matter reaching within few planck lengths of the horizon to talk about entropy loss which is what we have done in our discussion .",
    "in fact , physical processes very close to the horizon must play an important role in order to provide a complete picture of the issues we are discussing .",
    "there is already some evidence @xcite that the infinite redshift induced by the horizon plays a crucial role in this though a mathematically rigorous model is lacking .",
    "the last interpretation of the field equations ( see ) given in sec .",
    "3.2 is similar to switching from a passive point of view to an active point of view . instead of allowing matter to fall into the horizon",
    ", we made a virtual displacement of the horizon surface to engulf the matter when it is infinitesimally close to the horizon .",
    "but for the theory to be consistent , this displacement of the horizon surface degrees of freedom should cost some entropy . by determining the functional form of this entropy density",
    ", we should be able to obtain the field equations of gravity through an extremum principle . recall that thermodynamics relies entirely on the form of the entropy functional to make predictions .",
    "hence , if we can determine the form of entropy functional for gravity ( @xmath194 ) in terms of the normals to the null surfaces , then it seems natural to demand that the dynamics should follow from the extremum prescription @xmath195=0 $ ] for _ all null surfaces in the spacetime _ where @xmath196 is the relevant matter entropy .",
    "the form of @xmath196 and @xmath197 can be determined as follows .",
    "let us begin with @xmath196 which is easy to ascertain from the previous discussion .",
    "if @xmath198 is the matter energy - momentum tensor in a general @xmath199 dimensional spacetime then an expression for matter entropy _ relevant for our purpose _ can be taken to be @xmath200 where @xmath15 is a null vector field . from our",
    "we see that the entropy density associated with proper 3-volume is @xmath201 where  on the horizon  the vector @xmath71 becomes proportional to a null vector @xmath15 .",
    "if we now use the rindler coordinates in in which @xmath202 and interpret the factor @xmath203 as arising from an integration of @xmath204 in the range @xmath205 we find that the entropy density associated with a proper four volume is @xmath206 .",
    "this suggests treating as the matter entropy .",
    "for example , if @xmath198 is due to an ideal fluid at rest in the lif then @xmath207 will contribute @xmath208 , which  by gibbs - duhem relation  is just @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the entropy density and @xmath211 is the properly redshifted temperature with @xmath212 being the periodicity of the euclidean time coordinate .",
    "then @xmath213 which matches with in the appropriate limit .",
    "this argument works for any matter source , not necessarily the ones with which we conventionally associate an entropy .",
    "what is really relevant is only the _ energy _ flux close to the horizon from which one can obtain an entropy flux .",
    "we _ do _ have the notion of _ energy _ flux across a surface with normal @xmath158 being @xmath214 which holds for _ any _ source @xmath215 .",
    "given some energy flux @xmath11 in the rindler frame , there is an associated entropy flux loss @xmath216 as given by .",
    "it is _ this _ entropy which is given by and .",
    "the only non - trivial feature in is the integration range for time which is limited to @xmath205 .",
    "this is done by considering the integrals in the euclidean sector and rotating back to the lorentzian sector but the same result can be obtained working entirely in the euclidean sector .",
    "( there is an ambiguity in the overall scaling of @xmath15 since if @xmath15 is null so is @xmath217 for all @xmath218 ; we will comment on this ambiguity , which turns out to be irrelevant , later on . )",

    "usually , given a set of dynamical variables @xmath222 and a functional @xmath223 $ ] , the extremum principle will give a set of equations _ for _ the dynamical variable @xmath222 .",
    "here the situation is completely different .",
    "we expect the variational principle to hold for _ all _ null vectors @xmath15 thereby leading to a constraint on the _ background metric .",

    "it turns out  as we shall see below  that two conditions are sufficient to ensure this .",
    "first , the tensor @xmath224 should have the same algebraic symmetries as the riemann tensor @xmath225 of the @xmath47-dimensional spacetime .",
    "this condition can be ensured if we define @xmath226 as @xmath227 where @xmath228 is some scalar .",
    "the motivation for this choice arises from the fact that this approach leads to the same field equations as the one with @xmath27 as gravitational lagrangian in the conventional approach ( which explains the choice of the symbol @xmath27 ) .",
    "second , we will postulate the condition : @xmath229 as well as @xmath230 which is anyway satisfied by any matter energy - momentum tensor .",
    "one possible motivation for is to ensure that the field equations are no higher than second order in the metric .",

    "first , it is clear from that when @xmath27 depends on the curvature tensor and the metric , @xmath33 can depend up to the fourth derivative of the metric if is not satisfied .",
    "but when we impose then we are led to field equations which have , at most , second derivatives of the metric tensor which is a desirable feature .",
    "second , as we shall see below , with that condition we can actually determine the form of @xmath27 ; it turns out that in @xmath13 , it uniquely selects einstein s theory , which is probably a nice feature . in higher dimensions",
    ", it picks out a very geometrical extension of einstein s theory in the form of lanczos - lovelock  theories .",
    "third , it is difficult to imagine why the terms in should occur with very specific coefficients .",
    "in fact , it is not clear why we can not have derivatives of @xmath225 in @xmath27 , if the derivatives of @xmath224 can occur in the expression for entropy . finally ,",
    "if we take the idea of elastic constants being constants , then one is led to .",

    "so far we have not fixed @xmath231 so we have not fixed the theory . in a complete theory , the explicit form of @xmath231 will be determined by the long wavelength limit of the microscopic theory just as the elastic constants can  in principle  be determined from the microscopic theory of the lattice . in the absence of such a theory , we need to determine @xmath231 by general considerations which is possible when @xmath231 satisfies .",

    "the corresponding gravitational entropy functional has the @xmath263 structure .",

    "none of them can contribute in @xmath13 so we get einstein s theory as the unique choice if we assume @xmath13 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath231 is to be built _ only _ from the metric , then this choice is unique in all @xmath47 .",
    "while the matter term in the functional in has a natural interpretation in terms of entropy transfered across the horizon , the interpretation of the gravitational part needs to be made explicit .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath197 as entropy arises from the following two facts .",
    "first , we see from the identity that this term differs from @xmath266 by a total divergence . on the other hand ,",

    "in fact , shows that when the equations of motion holds _ the total entropy of a bulk region is entirely on its boundary_. further if we evaluate this boundary term @xmath267 ( where we have manipulated a few indices using the symmetries of @xmath231 ) in the case of a _ stationary _ horizon which can be locally approximated as rindler spacetime , one gets exactly the wald entropy of the horizon @xcite .",
    "the approach outlined above has important implications for the cosmological constant  problem , which we shall now briefly mention @xcite . in the conventional approach ,",
    "we start with an action principle which depends on matter degrees of freedom and the metric and vary ( i ) the matter degrees of freedom to obtain the equations of motion for matter and ( ii ) the metric @xmath28 to obtain the field equations of gravity .",
    "the equations of motion for _ matter _ remain invariant if one adds a constant , say , @xmath268 to the matter lagrangian .",
    "however , gravity breaks this symmetry which the matter sector has and @xmath17 appears as a cosmological constant  term in the field equations of gravity . if we interpret the evidence for dark energy in the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ; for a critical look at data , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) as due to the cosmological constant , then its value has to be fine - tuned to satisfy the observational constraints .",
    "it is not clear why a particular parameter in the low energy sector has to be fine - tuned in such a manner .    in the alternative perspective described here ,",
    "the functional in is clearly invariant under the shift @xmath269 or equivalently , @xmath270 , since it only introduces a term @xmath271 for any null vector @xmath222 .",
    "in other words , one _ can not _ introduce the cosmological constant as a low energy parameter in the action in this approach .",
    "we saw , however , that the cosmological constant can reappear as an _ an integration constant _ when the equations are solved .",
    "the integration constants which appear in a particular solution have a completely different conceptual status compared to the parameters which appear in the action describing the theory .",
    "it is much less troublesome to choose a fine - tuned value for a particular integration constant in the theory if observations require us to do so . from this point of view",
    ", the cosmological constant problem is considerably less severe when we view gravity from the alternative perspective .",
    "this extra symmetry under the shift @xmath270 arises because we are not treating metric as a dynamical variable in an action principle . in a universal manner , in which case",
    ", one will have the graviton coupling to the cosmological constant . in our approach",
    ", the linearized field equations for the spin-2 graviton field @xmath272 , in a suitable gauge , will be @xmath273 for all null vectors",
    "this equation is still invariant under @xmath270 showing that the graviton does _ not _ couple to cosmological constant .",

    "( 2 ) we demand full general covariance of the equations of motion . ( 3 )",
    "the equations of motion for matter sector are invariant under the addition of a constant to the matter lagrangian . then , we can prove a ` no - go ' theorem that the cosmological constant  problem can not be solved in such model .",
    "that is , we can not solve cosmological constant  problem unless we drop one of these three demands . of these , we do not want to sacrifice general covariance encoded in ( 2 ) ; neither do we have a handle on low energy matter lagrangian so we can not avoid ( 3 ) .",
    "so the only hope we have is to introduce an approach in which gravitational field equations are obtained from varying some degrees of freedom other than @xmath21 in a maximization principle .",
    "this suggests that the so called cosmological constant problem has its roots in our misunderstanding of the nature of gravity .",
    "our approach at present is not yet developed far enough to predict the value of the cosmological constant  .but providing a mechanism in which the _ bulk cosmological constant decouples from gravity _ is a major step forward .",
