    "recent activities in hadron physics are largely motivated by the observation signals for exotic hadrons .",
    "perhaps , one of the most influential ones is the @xmath5 . after the great amount of efforts , we are now at the stage of more careful investigation on the matter .",
    "the study of the exotic hadrons , at the same time , has brought revised interest in the physics of hadron resonances in general . among them , particularly interested is the sector of strangeness @xmath6 .",
    "the properties of the @xmath7 as well as the @xmath8-@xmath9 interaction have been discussed in many different ways : one noticeable suggestion was made for the @xmath7 by regarding it as the two pole structure of the resonance .",
    "another resonance @xmath10 attracts also a great deal of attention .",
    "this resonance of @xmath11 is well established with a relatively narrow decay width @xmath12 mev . in the quark model",
    "it is a member of 70-plet of su(6 ) with @xmath13 excitation , and is mostly dominated by the flavor singlet component . in the dynamical treatment of meson - baryon scattering , it appears as a quasi - bound state of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "both methods are equally successful in explaining the currently existing data of the @xmath16 .",
    "however , they have very different structure in its wave function , and make different predictions in some physical quantities .    in modern experimental facilities such as the spring-8 and jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) , production experiments of this resonance",
    "can be carried out with high precision , so that it is of great interest and importance to study the reactions theoretically .",
    "understanding the mechanism of the @xmath16-production is very useful not only for the extraction of its properties but also for the explanation of the recent observation of the peak structure corresponding to the @xmath5 in the reaction @xmath17 .",
    "motivated by these facts , there have been several works on this reaction both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , very recently .",
    "in addition to the previous experiments for the @xmath16-photoproduction  @xcite , a recent experiment conducted by the leps collaboration at the spring-8 revealed an interesting feature : it turned out that the production rate of the @xmath16 was strongly dependent on the target nucleon , which implies that the production mechanism of the @xmath16-photoproduction has strong charge asymmetry .",
    "interestingly , this feature is consistent with the theoretical prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite in which it was proposed that this asymmetry might be explained by the contact term which was required in order to satisfy the gauge invariance , and was present for the proton target ( @xmath18 ) but not for the neutron target ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the size of the contact term is significant , at least as compared with the @xmath1-channel , @xmath2-channel , and kaon exchange in the @xmath3-channel process .",
    "the contact - term dominance shown in the previous study  @xcite , however , depends on the unknown strength of the @xmath4-exchange diagram which is active both for the proton and neutron in the almost same order of magnitude .",
    "the importance of the contact term was ignored in the analysis of the previous experiments  @xcite , while the role of the @xmath4-exchange was emphasized .",
    "it is now of great importance to test each contribution of various terms in the reaction , especially , that of the contact and @xmath4-exchange terms . in the present work",
    ", we aim at investigating this issue in very detail . in the current and future experiments such as the leps and the clas at the jlab",
    ", various angular distributions are expected to be available with the polarized photon and nucleon target utilized .",
    "therefore , we consider the differential cross sections under different conditions of the polarization of the beam and target so that we may extract information on how each term contributes to the differential cross sections .    this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we explain the present method briefly .",
    "we define various effective interactions which are necessary to compute the transition amplitudes . in section 3",
    ", we present the differential cross sections with each born diagram separately , including the @xmath1- , @xmath2- , @xmath3-channel processes and contact term . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider possible experimental conditions to distinguish the contact term dominance from @xmath20- and @xmath4-exchanges by using angular distributions and asymmetries .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section we define the effective lagrangians relevant to the @xmath21 process as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , where we consider five tree ( born ) diagrams : @xmath1-channel ( upper - left ) , @xmath2-channel ( upper - right ) , @xmath3-channel with pseudoscalar @xmath22-exchange ( @xmath23 ) and with vector @xmath24-exchange ( @xmath25 ) ( lower - left ) , and contact term ( lower - right ) .",
    "we define the momenta of the photon , pseudoscalar kaon , vector kaon , nucleon and @xmath16 as shown in fig .",
    "the spin-3/2 particle is treated as a rarita - schwinger ( rs ) field  @xcite , and its treatment can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "-photoproduction . ]    the relevant effective lagrangians are then given as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath9 , @xmath27 , @xmath20 , @xmath4 and @xmath28 are the nucleon , @xmath16 , pseudoscalar kaon , vector @xmath4 and photon fields , respectively .",
    "the interaction for the @xmath29 vertex is taken from ref .  @xcite . as for the @xmath30 vertex for the @xmath2-channel",
    ", we utilize the effective interaction suggested by ref .",
    "@xcite which contains four form factors of different multipoles .",
    "we ignore the electric coupling @xmath31 , since the @xmath16 is neutral .",
    "we also neglect @xmath32 and @xmath33 terms , assuming that higher multipole terms are less important .",
    "hence , for the photon coupling to the @xmath16 , we consider only the magnetic coupling term @xmath34 whose strength is proportional to the anomalous magnetic moment of the @xmath16 , @xmath35 . in the present work , we set @xmath36 as a trial .",
    "we will see that the @xmath2-channel contribution is very small as compared with the dominant contact term if the @xmath35 is not too large .",
    "the @xmath37 coupling constant , @xmath38 is determined to be @xmath39 by using the experimental data ( @xmath40 mev )  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the @xmath41 coupling constant shortly .",
    "we note that the last lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) represents the contact term interaction which is necessary to maintain the ward - takahashi identity of the amplitudes .",
    "having set up these lagrangians , we can write the scattering amplitudes as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the photon polarization vector and the rs vector - spinor .",
    "@xmath45 is the spin-3/2 fermion propagator  @xcite , for which here we use the usual spin-1/2 fermion propagator , since the difference is negligible in the relatively low energy regions  @xcite . for the form factor",

    "@xcite : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the on - shell mass of the exchange particle in the @xmath50-channel . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the use of this form factor in eq.([formfactor ] ) satisfies the ward - takahashi identity and can reproduce the existing data qualitatively well .    in the present treatment",
    "there are two unknown parameters , i.e. the cutoff @xmath46 in the form factor and the @xmath51 coupling constant .",
    "the former is fixed to be @xmath52 mev as done in refs  @xcite .",
    "the only remaining unknown is the strength of the @xmath51 coupling constant . in theoretical models ,",
    "the coupling constant is rather small  @xcite .",
    "since this value affects the feature of the contact term dominance , we will treat it as a free parameter and see how much the contact term contributes to the amplitude .",
    "@xcite , it was already shown that the contribution of the contact term was significantly larger than those from the @xmath1- , @xmath2- , @xmath3-channels and @xmath4-exchange when @xmath53 was not too large , i.e. @xmath54 . in order to verify it , we need to examine each contribution to the differential cross sections in detail .    in fig .",

    "is fixed to be @xmath59 for @xmath20-exchange .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ theta_dep ] that the differential cross section with all contributions increases in particular in the forward direction as @xmath60 increases . as shown in fig .",

    "the coupling constant is an electric type and has the following structure : @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the momenta of the exchanged ( intermediate ) and final - state kaons .",
    "therefore , the scattered kaon and nucleon in the final state are produced most likely to be in the direction parallel to the photon polarization vector .",

    "in contrast , @xmath87 of @xmath4-exchange takes positive values except for @xmath90 and @xmath14 , which is due to the magnetic type coupling , though not complete .",

    "is to apply the reaction mechanism which can be established for the known resonance @xmath0 to reactions involving @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , assuming that the spin and parity of @xmath5 are the same as those of @xmath0 , @xmath11 , we can apply the present results almost straightforwardly to the case of @xmath5 within the framework of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "for example , we have already reported a large asymmetry between the cross sections of the proton and neutron targets  @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate of charge exchange process is significantly larger than that of charge non - exchange process . for the case of @xmath0",
    "the proton target reaction is larger , while it is other way around for the case of @xmath5 , that is , the neutron target reaction is dominant .    in drawing this conclusion , however , it is crucial to know the strength of the @xmath94 coupling constant , since the @xmath4-exchange process does not have a strong selectivity between the proton and neutron target reactions . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4-exchange process plays an important role in angular distributions as well as in determining the magnitude for the cross sections . for the case of @xmath0",
    ", a recent study indicates that the coupling is not very strong and the above feature is maintained  @xcite . on the contrary , the @xmath94 coupling constant is not known , but a naive estimation in the quark model is not so strong , and therefore the above feature of charge exchange dominance is not very much affected .",
    "we consider that the measurement and comparison of the experimental and theoretical values of the @xmath41 coupling constant is important , in order to test the applicability of the presently available models for hadrons , especially in the kaon productions .",
    "once they are established , we can also extend the same method to the physics of exotic hadrons including the @xmath5 , particularly because the energies of the @xmath0 and @xmath5 reactions are expected to be very similar .",
    "such a strategy should be of great use in order to understand the structure of exotic hadrons . once again , as shown in fig .",
    "[ theta_dep ] , the different @xmath61-dependence is helpful to determine the value for @xmath95 .",
    "we would like to emphasize also that the discussion of @xmath61-dependence is applied to the resonance productions of spin-1/2 .",
    "another feature of the helicity conservation can be also applied to the @xmath5 productions . just as in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "this will help us make some constraints on the unknown spin of the @xmath5 .",
    "in the present work , we have investigated the @xmath96 reaction in the effective lagrangian approach . in particular",
    ", we aim at scrutinizing each contribution of various diagrams to the reaction : on one hand , the contact term plays the crucial role in describing the @xmath97 process . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4-exchange term may become non - negligible .",
    "it is of utmost importance to understand this difference , since the contact term exists in the proton channel while it is absent in the neutron channel , so that the rate of the @xmath16-production turns out to be suppressed in the neutron target .",
    "we have asserted that it is of great use to investigate the azimuthal angular distributions of the differential cross section in order to understand the role of each contribution .",
    "in particular , the angular @xmath61-distribution , or alternatively , the asymmetries @xmath87 and @xmath82 , which can be measured by using the polarized photon beam , distinguish each role of the contact term , @xmath4-exchange , and @xmath20-exchange terms according to the polarization of the photon beam .",
    "we have observed that if the contact term dominates , the asymmetry becomes almost zero , while the @xmath4-exchange contribution increases , the asymmetry becomes finite .",
    "hence , a measurement of the asymmetries will provide a touchstone for understanding the reaction mechanism of the @xmath16-photoproduction .",
    "not only theoretically but also experimentally , the contact term dominance is one of the most interesting features for the spin-3/2 baryon photoproduction as well as for the @xmath16-photoproduction in general . in spite of possible model dependence in treating baryons with different spins , the above - mentioned feature does not appear in the spin-1/2 baryon photoproduction .",
    "an experimental confirmation of the contact term dominance in the @xmath16-photoproduction is important and may be a challenging task . as discussed in the present work ,",
    "since the test of the contact term dominance can be made in particular in the very forward direction and near the threshold , the leps collaboration at the spring-8 may be one of the good places for verifying it .",
