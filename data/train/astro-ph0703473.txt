    "the first white dwarf known to have a dusty debris disk or cloud was giclas 29 - 38 , discovered by zuckerman & becklin ( 1987 ) to have pronounced excesses in the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 bands relative to the white dwarf s photosphere .",

    "while we do not have strong evidence regarding the distribution of the dust around g 29 - 38 , we do have a few constraints : the near - ir pulsation data suggest a non - spherical dust distribution ( graham et al .",
    "1990 ; patterson et al .",
    "1991 ) and the particles we see in emission radiate at temperatures of 290 to 890 k ( reach et al .",
    "2005b ) . given the luminosity of the white dwarf ( 2 @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , these temperatures places the dust particles at approximately 0.15 to a few solar radii ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ; jura 2003 ; reach et al .",
    "2005b ) ; the outer radius depends on whether we assume the dust is in an optically thin or thick component .",

    "our observations consisted of five dithers of 30 seconds each ( 150 seconds total integration time ) for every wd in our survey .",
    "we used the products of the _ spitzer _ science center pipeline , the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames and the post - bcd frames ( mosaics ) , for our analysis .",
    "we used iraf phot as well as a custom idl package to perform aperture photometry on individual bcd frames .",
    "we also attempted psf - fitting photometry but found that the poorly defined point response function for the irac instrument with its large pixels ( 1.213 and 1.220 arcseconds at 4.5 and 8 microns , respectively ) meant that we obtained better results with the idl and iraf aperture photometry than with psf - fitting photometry .",
    "both the idl and iraf approaches gave identical results , within the errors . in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we used 5 pixel apertures for bright , isolated objects , and 2 or 3 pixel apertures for faint objects or objects in crowded fields .",
    "we corrected the resultant fluxes by the aperture correction factors determined by the irac team ( see the irac data handbook ) . for each object , we compared the photometry from 2 , 3 , and 5 pixel apertures ; we found them all to be consistent within the errors .",
    "following the standard irac calibration procedure , we made corrections for the observed array location of each wd before averaging the fluxes of the five frames in each irac band .",

    "these two detections among the general population of white dwarfs indicate a detection rate of 1.6% in our flux limited wd sample . however , other surveys have shown higher circumstellar dust detection rates with more limited samples .",

    "the greater sensitivity to wds with circumstellar dust in the _ spitzer _ survey did not yield more such systems ; the daz survey at the irtf had a @xmath35.6 times higher yield . this result , along with the fact that our new circumstellar dust system , wd2115@xmath0560 , turned out to be a daz ( a fact we did not know when we assembled the sample ) , suggests a deep connection between detectable circumstellar dust around wds and the daz phenomenon .",

    "the assumptions of an optically - thin dust cloud and blackbody dust place the detectable dust at 1 to 5 @xmath2 from the wd .",
    "the poynting - robertson ( p - r ) timescale for particles to spiral onto the wd from a debris reservoir at 1 @xmath2 is only 4 @xmath20 years , where @xmath20 is the particle radius in microns .",
    "the silicate emission feature observed by reach et al .",
    "( 2005b ) can only be as strong as it is relative to the continuum ( contrast = 125% ) , if it is emitted by submicron particles .",
    "the p - r timescale for such tiny particles is years or less .",
    "radiation pressure can eject small grains in orbit around a star ( e.g. ,  wyatt & whipple 1950 ) . a spherical blackbody grain with radius @xmath21 and density @xmath22 ( in g @xmath23 ) will be ejected from bound orbit around a wd by radiation pressure if @xmath24 , where @xmath25 however , for a typical wd luminosity , @xmath26 , and wd mass , @xmath27 , the blowout size is 0.002 @xmath7 m , much smaller than the grains producing the 10 @xmath7 m feature .      an optically - thin dust cloud would have a lifetime no longer than the short p - r time scale .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the dust cloud is optically thick , shielding much of the dust from the stellar radiation that causes p - r drag . with this idea in mind",
    ", we fit the seds of each of the four wd debris systems using standard optically - thick flat disk models ( friedjung 1985 ; jura 2003 ) .",
    "we derived the input spectra for these simple disk models by fitting blackbody curves to the photospheric portions of the seds , and then used the models to derive disk inclinations and dust temperatures that correspond to the inner and outer radii of the disks .",
    "for each wd , we created a grid of models with inner disk temperatures @xmath28 = 600 to 1250 k , outer disk temperatures @xmath29 = 200 to 1175 k , @xmath30 , and a range of inclination angles .",
    "we then found the model that best fit the ir photometry of each wd ( j band and beyond ) by minimizing @xmath31 .",
    "table 1 lists the temperature ranges and inclinations of the best fit models .",
    "for gd 56 and gd 362 we included the irtf spectroscopy of kilic et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006b ) in the data to be fit .",
    "for g 29 - 38 we performed one fit using our _ spitzer _ photometry and another fit using the irtf ( tokunaga et al .",
    "1999 ) plus iso photometry ( chary et al .",
    "1999 ) , though without the 10.5 @xmath7 m photometry , which is likely to be influenced by the strong silicate emission feature .",
    "the fit to the older irtf and iso photometry was poorer than the fit to the _ spitzer _ data , and we report only the fit to the modern data in table 1 .",
    "the difference between the _ spitzer _ and older data sets most likely reflects calibration errors that plagued the ground - based and particularly the iso photometry ( r. chary and b. zuckerman , private communication ) .",
    "it is also possible that the g 29 - 38 debris disk has evolved substantially over the 15 year span of these observations .",
    "figures 14 present our best fit debris disk models .",
    "all four dazd wds show a pronounced ir excess relative to the expected wd photospheres , represented by the wd model atmospheres ( solid lines , kindly provided by detlev koester ) the debris disk components ( dashed lines ) fit the near - ir and mid - ir excess well .    table 1 also lists the inner and outer radii of the best fit flat disk models .",
    "they range from 0.15 to 0.58 @xmath2 = 13 to 49 white dwarf radii for the three normal mass wds , and 0.08 to 0.50 @xmath2 = 17 to 106 white dwarf radii for gd 362 , assuming the high mass value currently in the literature , which implies a much smaller radius .",
    "the disk model has no explicit inner edge directly exposed to radiation from the wd , and thus the inner radii are significantly underestimated .",
    "perhaps the observations of daz disks all point to a common simple picture originally suggested by jura ( 2003 ) ; the disks are analogs of planetary rings , physically thin disks of rocks and dust with optical depth @xmath32 1 .",
    "our new data make this analogy much more compelling .",
    "as shown above , the physically thin , optically - thick disk geometry implied by this picture can match the observed seds of dazd wds .",
    "besides providing an excuse for that disk geometry , the planetary - ring analogy has the following virtues .    \\1 .",
    "this picture naturally incorporates both small dust grains and larger , long - lived source particles .",
    "standard models of planetary rings ( e.g. ,  cuzzi et al .  1979 )",
    "contain a distribution of particle sizes .",
    "the largest ring particles contain most of a ring s mass .",
    "these particles occupy a `` monolayer '' a few particle - widths thick , while the smaller particles  like the ones observed to produce the 10-micron emission feature in g29 - 38 ( reach et al .",
    "2005b)are spread over a thicker poly - layer .",
    "planetary rings may also consist of dusty rings interspersed with rings of larger bodies ( e.g. ,  de pater et al .",
    "the small particles are continually produced by the collisions of the larger particles , and protected to some degree from radiation forces by the optical thickness of the ring .",
    "this picture provides a disk lifetime consistent with the ages of the dazd wds .",
    "an optically - thick disk of rocks has a lifetime set by the viscous spreading time of the ring , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the radius of the ring and @xmath35 is the kinematic viscosity . to estimate the disk lifetime ,",
    "let us assume that the viscosity of the wd rings is similar to that of saturn s rings .",
    "the viscosity of a monolayer ring is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the optical depth and @xmath38 is a representative particle size , weighted toward the larger particles ( goldreich & tremaine 1982 ) . the angular speed in the wd ring is similar to that in planetary rings : @xmath39 s@xmath40 . so assuming a similar viscosity for the wd debris disks and saturn s rings is like assuming a similar optical depth and particle size distribution . with this assumption ,",
    "the wd ring lifetimes are @xmath3100 times longer than the lifetime of saturn s rings because of their larger radii .",
    "this lifetime is easily @xmath41 years , comparable to the median post - main sequence lifetime of the wds in our survey . in this picture , wd rings do not require continual replenishment from a longer - lived source of small bodies .",
    "this picture implies a metal accretion rate consistent with the photospheric abundances of metals in the dazd wds .    in the context of this picture",
    ", we can estimate the mass of a typical dazd disk as @xmath42 , using the surface density of saturn s rings ( @xmath43 g @xmath44 ; tiscareno et al .",
    "2007 ) and an outer radius @xmath45 ( see item 5 , below ) . with these assumptions ,",
    "we find a representative disk mass of @xmath32 @xmath46 .",
    "if the accretion time is @xmath47 years , the resulting accretion rate onto the wd is @xmath37 @xmath48 m@xmath11 yr@xmath40 .",
    "figure 5 shows the observed photospheric abundances derived by koester & wilken ( 2006 ) for a large sample of daz wds .",
    "figure 6 shows accretion rates for this sample inferred from these photospheric abundances and the atmospheric residence times koester & wilken ( 2006 ) derived for these wds . these accretion rates from koester & wilken ( 2006 ) are based on an assumption that the accreted material has solar composition .",
    "our model assumes that the material is mostly refractory , so to compare our accretion rate to figure  6 , we need to multiply it by a factor of 50 , giving us @xmath33 @xmath49 m@xmath11 yr@xmath40 .",
    "this accretion rate sits right in the middle of the range of daz inferred accretion rates , and is only about an order of magnitude less than that of the known dazds .",
    "it is easy to imagine a disk with slightly higher surface density or viscosity than saturn s rings that would precisely match the dazd accretion rates in figure 6 .",
    "this picture explains the inner radii of dazd disks inferred from their seds .    the radius where the equilibrium temperature of a dust grain exceeds the sublimation temperature , @xmath50 , for the grains should mark the inner boundary of the ring .",
    "although most of the disk sees only stellar radiation at an oblique angle , the inner radius of the disk can see direct stellar radiation , so it should be hotter than the flat - disk model would predict , closer to the temperature of an optically - thin dust cloud , or a single grain in free space . with this geometry in mind , we find that for blackbody grains , the sublimation radius is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the wd luminosity . for a typical wd luminosity , @xmath53 , and assuming a silicate sublimation temperature , @xmath54  k , equation  2 gives @xmath55 .",
    "another component of the disks may be grains too small to efficiently emit at the blackbody peak wavelength .",
    "these grains are slightly hotter than blackbody grains at the same location in the nebula , so they sublimate at larger radii .",
    "e.g. , for the `` medium''-sized grains described by backman & paresce ( 1993 ) , the sublimation radius is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the grain size measured in microns . for the same assumed wd luminosity and silicate sublimation temperature , and for a grain size of 1  @xmath7 m , @xmath58 .",
    "table 1 , column 12 lists dust sublimation radii for each of the dazds calculated from equation  2 assuming @xmath59  k. this assumption produces a good match to the inner radii inferred from our models of the seds .",
    "however , we did not incorporate the physics of direct heating of the inner rim of the disk into our sed modeling , so we can not compare sublimation radii calculated using the assumption of direct heating to the radii inferred from our flat disk models .",
    "we can , however , compare the inner temperatures inferred from our flat disk models to the sublimation temperatures of typical dust materials and retain self - consistency .",
    "table 1 , column 9 lists the temperatures of the inner and outer edges of the disks inferred from the flat disk models . the temperatures at the inner edge range from 8001150  k.    \\5 .",
    "this picture explains the outer radii of dazd disks inferred from their seds .",
    "a dynamically cold ring can not extend much beyond the roche radius ; beyond this radius , the ring particles coagulate into moons  or in the case of the white dwarf rings  asteroids or planets .",
    "the roche radius for tidal disruption of an asteroid near a wd is given by jura ( 2003 ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a parameter of order unity that depends on the asteroid s composition , orbit , and rotation , @xmath62 is the radius of the wd , @xmath63 is the density of the wd , and @xmath64 is the density of the asteroid . for g 29 - 38 , @xmath65 .",
    "since this equation only includes density to the one - third power and wd masses span a narrow range ( @xmath30.55 to 1.2 m@xmath11 ) , all wds have about the same roche radii .",
    "jura ( 2003 ) pointed out that the outer radius of the disk around g29 - 38 roughly matched the roche radius for this wd .",
    "we find that the outer radii of all the dazd disks as inferred from physically - thin , optically thick disk models for the seds are consistent with the wd roche radii .",
    "this picture may explain the absence of dust around luminous daz white dwarfs .",
    "this _ spitzer _ survey and the survey of kilic et al .",
    "( 2006b ) examined eleven daz white dwarfs hotter than 15,000 k and found circumstellar dust around none of them ( see figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the high surface abundances and very short atmospheric residence times for calcium ( see  4 ) in these eleven stars made them excellent candidates to host observable debris disks .",
    "gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) discovered a single wd with effective temperature @xmath322,000 k that hosts a calcium gas disk , but shows no sign of circumstellar dust .",
    "these observations suggest that perhaps hotter , more luminous wds can not host dust .",
    "the analogy between wd disks and planetary rings suggests a natural interpretation of these observations ; for hot wds , the sublimation zone reaches beyond the roche radius .",
    "these wds , like main sequence stars , lack a circumstellar region where small bodies are stable against both sublimation and coagulation in dynamically - cold disks .",
    "we can find the critical wd effective temperature above which this stable region disappears by setting @xmath66 , assuming blackbody dust grains : @xmath67 ignoring the slow dependence of this expression on the wd density , we find the critical wd temperature is @xmath68 . if instead we use the 1  @xmath7 m `` medium '' grains of backman & paresce ( 1993 ) , we find that the maximum wd temperature for hosting a dust disk is @xmath69 so @xmath70 .    for grains with @xmath71",
    "k , we find @xmath72  k , and @xmath73  k. we suggested above that the inner edges of the observed dazd disks match blackbody grains with @xmath74  k. this combination implies that there should be no disks around wds hotter than @xmath75  k , keeping in mind the caveats described above .",
    "the observations described above suggest that the critical temperature should be roughly 15,00022,000 k. these observations broadly agree with the hypothesis that the grain sublimation temperature and the roche radius together limit the kinds of wds that can host dust disks , although clearly details remain to be better understood .",
    "as we mentioned above , the presence of photospheric metals in dazs implies ongoing accretion of these metals . our physical model for the dazd disks provides a natural explanation for this accretion .",
    "let us examine in more detail the connection between dazd disks and the daz phenomenon .",
    "white dwarfs are classified as daz or dbz if their optical spectra contain metal lines along with much stronger hydrogen or helium lines , respectively .",
    "white dwarfs showing metal lines may also be classified simply dz if they are too cool to show hydrogen or helium lines .",
    "hybrid types , such as dabz , also exist .    since the discovery of metal lines in wd atmospheres ( see weidemann 1958 ; greenstein 1960 ) , the origin of these metals has been debated ( e.g. ,  lacombe et al .  1983 ; aannestad et al .  1993 ; dupuis , fontaine , & wesemael 1993 ; zuckerman & reid 1998 ; zuckerman et al .",
    "2003 ; koester & wilken 2006 ; kilic & redfield 2007 ) . the high surface gravity of wds should cause the denser atoms of the metals to sink in the atmosphere on timescales of days to millions of years , depending on the atmospheric constituents , effective temperature , and wd mass .",
    "these timescales are all much shorter than the ages of most wds .",
    "figure 7 shows the timescale for gravitational settling for da wds with log(g ) = 7.75 to 9.0 , roughly mass = 0.48 to 1.20 m@xmath11 , taken from koester & wilken ( 2006 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the four dazd stars are plotted on this figure based on their atmospheric @xmath13 and log(g ) values .",
    "figure 7 shows that for the wds hotter than 11,000 k , the settling times are substantially less than a year and even for our coolest , low surface gravity object , wd2115@xmath0560 , the settling time is still less than 200 years .",
    "these short settling timescales imply that daz stars were very recently accreting heavy elements .",
    "interstellar accretion , perhaps the most discussed scenario for supplying the heavy elements , seems to fail by orders of magnitude for many of the known daz wds ( aannestad et al .",
    "1993 ; although see the counter - argument by koester & wilken 2006 )",
    ". however , such accretion would be natural if daz wds typically harbor substantial circumstellar disks .",
    "so far all debris wd systems with circumstellar disks have detectable photospheric metal lines .",
    "is it possible that all metal - rich wds ( daz / dbz / dz ) accrete their metals via debris disks ?",
    "one reason answering this question is difficult is that not all wds with photospheric metals can be recognized as daz / dbz / dzs .",
    "this point is made in figure 5 , where the curve indicating a constant ca equivalent width of 15 m  corresponds to much higher ca abundances for hotter wds than for cooler wds .",
    "it is much more difficult to recognize a daz at higher stellar temperatures .",
    "figure 6 shows another view of the same data , easier to grasp visually , but more model - dependent .",
    "the maximum accretion rates necessary to explain the observed abundances are essentially independent of @xmath13 ; the short atmospheric residence timescales for the hot wds are balanced by the deeper convective reservoirs for the cooler wds .",
    "the dazd wds are located near the top of figures 5 and 6 ; they are among the wds with the highest photospheric heavy element abundances and the highest inferred accretion rates , and therefore should harbor the most massive and easiest to detect of the debris disks .",
    "it thus seems possible that the debris disks found to date display an observational selection effect , and that the majority of dazs harbor debris disks .    for all dazd",
    "wds except the possibly massive gd 362 , koester & wilken ( 2006 ) find accretion rates in the narrow range of 4.078.13 @xmath76 m@xmath11 yr@xmath40 .",
    "koester & wilken ( 2006 ) assumed that the accreted material had solar abundances .",
    "we assume instead that the accreted material lacks hydrogen and helium , reducing the total accretion rate by a factor of 50 .",
    "this lower limit corresponds to 8 to 16 @xmath77 m@xmath11 yr@xmath40 or 1.6 to 3.2 @xmath78 g yr@xmath40 of refractory elements fed to the wd , a rate consistent with viscous accretion in our planetary - ring model .",
    "if this accretion persists for at least 25% of the lifetime of the wds , commensurate with the fraction of das that are dazs ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2003 ) , it corresponds to an accreted mass of @xmath79 of an earth mass accreted over 1 gyr .",
    "we have discussed the basic properties of the debris systems found to date and we have connected the debris observable in the infrared to the photospheric metal lines observable in the optical . we have argued that dust debris is common around wds and that this dust must be steadily accreting onto the wd .",
    "we have not yet examined possible sources for the debris around wds . here",
    "we consider possible origins : wd mergers , debris left during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) phases , and accretion of dust derived from planetary system bodies .",
    "merging wds are expected to leave behind disks ( livio , pringle , & wood 2005 ; hansen , kulkarni , & wiktorowicz 2006 ) to shed angular momentum . according to the calculations of livio et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , such disks should be massive ( @xmath30.007 m@xmath11 ) , extend to 1 au or more , and predominantly composed of carbon and oxygen , assuming the merger of two wds each with mass @xmath80 0.7 m@xmath11 .",
    "the minimum mass for most of these merged wds ought to be @xmath81 1.1 m@xmath11 , since it takes about 10 gyr to produce a 0.55 m@xmath11 wd .    except for gd 362 , with a mass possibly equal to 1.24 m@xmath11 , these mass constraints rule out this explanation for the majority of dazd wds .",
    "the other wds with circumstellar dust have masses ranging from 0.52 to 0.69 m@xmath11 .",
    "additionally , the disk mass and radial extent appear inconsistent with all dazd stars discovered to date . while wd mergers must be taking place , and they may possibly be the source of the disk around gd 362 , they are not the source of the majority of the observed dazd systems .      the outflows of late - stage asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) are often highly non - spherical",
    ". this process is not understood , and a range of models have been proposed for the origin of the asymmetries , including stellar companions and magnetic fields ( see balick & adams 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "there is circumstantial evidence for the formation of disks and tori during the agb to post - agb star transition , albeit at much greater distances from the host star , and most ppne are producing or have recently produced dust particles ( balick & adams 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , waters et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed olivines and pyroxenes around a pre - white dwarf .",
    "while most of the outflows are ejected well above the stars escape velocities , at present it is not known whether some small fraction of these outflows remain in orbit after they are ejected .",
    "remaining stellar material is a possible explanation for the dust disk discovered by su et al .",
    "( 2007 ) around ( at 35150 au ) the helix planetary nebula . while su et al .",
    "attribute the observed dust to disrupted kuiper belt objects or disrupted comets , it could also be the result of stellar material ejected with less than the escape speed .",
    "this scenario predicts dusty environments for the youngest wds with less and less dust as wds age .",
    "the observations , however , run counter to this .",
    "all four of the known dazd systems have old host wds with ages of @xmath16 0.2 to @xmath16 2.5 gyr and no hot , dusty wds have been discovered .",
    "the metal disk wd found by gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) pushes this to slightly younger objects , @xmath30.1 gyr , but still , if the late stages of stellar evolution commonly leave debris disks at a range of radii , these debris disk should be detectable in our survey and in iue observations of hot wds . yet , to date , no such systems have been seen ( hansen et al .",
    "2006 ; kilic et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "the dust around dazds may represent the remains of planetary systems .",
    "roughly 5 - 10% of a - type stars have substantial debris disks ( e.g. ,  backman & paresce 1993 ) and precise doppler surveys find giant planets around roughly 5 - 10% of solar - type stars ( e.g. ,  fischer & valenti 2003 ) .",
    "perhaps 5 - 10% or more of wd progenitors had planetary systems , and some small bodies in these systems survived the post - main sequence evolution of their host stars ( debes & siguardsson 2002 , jura 2003 ) .",
    "our observations and models appear to be consistent with this picture for the origin of all the dazd disks .",
    "we presented the properties of wd2115@xmath0560 , a new wd with infrared excess we discovered in our _ spitzer _ irac photometry , and the fourth daz seen to have an infrared excess well - described by circumstellar dust debris .",
    "we examined the dusty daz wds as a class , which we refer to with the letters `` dazd '' .    using a simple , flat , optically - thick disk model motivated by the geometry of saturn s rings , we find that the dust in these four dazd wds reside in disks ranging in inner temperature from @xmath3800 to 1150 k and outer temperature from @xmath3200 to 725 k , not taking into account the direct heating of the inner edges of the disks .",
    "the outer disk temperatures are likely to be lower limits set by the sensitivity of the observations and the amount of dust radiating at that temperature .",
    "these dust temperatures imply that the inner disk edges are at @xmath1 0.1 to 0.2 @xmath2 and the detectable extent of the outer disks are @xmath30.3 to 0.6 @xmath2 .",
    "the close circumstellar locations of these debris disks are consistent with simple sublimation calculations and with the roche radius for tidal disruption of an asteroid near a wd ( jura 2003 ) .",
    "we find that , taken together , the dazd wds point to a disk model analogous to planetary rings .",
    "this model naturally explains the disk accretion rates and lifetimes and the temperature distribution of the dusty wds .",
    "we favor the interpretation that most of these disks represent planetary systems remnants .",
