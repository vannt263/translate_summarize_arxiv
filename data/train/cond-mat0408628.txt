    "cuo@xmath19 squares are connected with each other by sharing a oxygen at the corner , while they are connected by sharing two oxygens at the edge in the latter .",
    "doped holes make cuo@xmath19 squares nonmagnetic through the change of the cu valency from cu@xmath14 to cu@xmath20 or the formation of zhang - rice singlet pairs of oxygen holes and cu@xmath14 spins@xcite , to divide the magnetic intrachain interaction .",

    "however , the study of the carrier - doping effect in the chain is not easy in sr@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath23 because of the existence of the spin - ladder plane of cu@xmath5o@xmath24 .",

    "that is , every other cu@xmath14 spin belonging to one sublattice is regarded as forming an antiferromagnetic long - range order , while holes and cu@xmath14 spins belonging to the other sublattice are regarded as being localized and forming spin - singlet pairs with a spin gap , respectively . from the structural analysis , on the other hand ,",
    "et al._@xcite have proposed another model in which holes are located almost periodically at intervals of two cu@xmath14 spins . in this case , it follows that cu@xmath14 spins on both sides of a hole form a spin - singlet pair with a spin gap , while a small amount of residual cu@xmath14 spins exhibit an antiferromagnetic order .",

    "magnetic fields are applied parallel to the @xmath7-axis .",
    "closed and open symbols indicate characteristic magnetic - fields and temperatures estimated from the magnetization curve and specific heat measurements , respectively .",
    "typical spin arrangements seen along the @xmath35-axis ( i.e. parallel to the cuo@xmath5 chain ) are shown in the paramagnetic , antiferromagnetically ordered and spin - flopped phases . ]",
    "@xmath90 s shown by closed symbols are defined at the maximum point of the field - derivative of the magnetization curve for @xmath91 and at the point where linear extrapolations of the segments of the magnetization curve below and above @xmath90 intersect with each other for @xmath92 and 1.3 .",
    "transition temperatures defined at the peak of the temperature dependence of the specific heat are plotted by open symbols .",
    "it is found that the initial spin arrangement changes into a spin - flopped one at @xmath90 with increasing field and that the region of the initial spin arrangement becomes narrow through the hole doping .    here",
    ", we estimate the magnitude of the the exchange field and the magnetic anisotropy field parallel to the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the spin - flop transition takes place at @xmath90 where the gain of the zeeman energy overcomes the loss due to the magnetic anisotropy energy responsible for the preferred spin direction . in terms of a simple uniaxial mean - field model@xcite ,",
    "the spin - flop transition field at 0 k is given by @xmath90(0 ) @xmath93 ( 2@xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96)@xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the magnetic anisotropy field and the exchange field , respectively .",
    "@xmath99 is roughly given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a field where the cu@xmath14 moment is saturated . by extrapolating the magnetization curve to the saturated value estimated from the number of cu@xmath14 spins ,",
    "@xmath102 is estimated as @xmath12 70 t for @xmath9 0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.2 and 1.3 , which is almost independent of @xmath8 .",
    "so , @xmath99 is calculated to be @xmath12 35 t , implying no change of the magnitude of the exchange interaction up to @xmath53 .",
    "using the extrapolated value of @xmath90(0 ) @xmath93 10.5 t , 10.0 t , 8.5 t , 4.0 t and 3.0 t , @xmath98 s are calculated to be 1.6 t , 1.5 t , 1.0 t , 0.2 t and 0.1 t for @xmath9 0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.2 and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that the decrease of @xmath37 through the hole doping is not attributed to the decrease of @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath99 but the decrease of the magnetic anisotropy parallel to the @xmath7-axis corresponding to @xmath98 .",
    "this is consistent with the recent inelastic neutron scattering results of ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 that @xmath16 is almost independent of @xmath8 and that the anisotropic exchange interaction , @xmath103 , decreases with increasing @xmath8@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a metamagnetic transition has been reported in the edge - sharing cuo@xmath5 chain system of ca@xmath104la@xmath2cu@xmath22o@xmath23@xcite .",
    "the difference in the transition in magnetic fields between ca@xmath104la@xmath2cu@xmath22o@xmath23 and ca@xmath5y@xmath5cu@xmath2o@xmath3 is explained as being due to that in @xmath16 .",
    "that is , @xmath16 estimated from the neutron scattering experiments is as small as @xmath103 in ca@xmath104la@xmath2cu@xmath22o@xmath23@xcite , while @xmath16 is about 10 - 100 times larger than @xmath103 in ca@xmath5y@xmath5cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xcite",
    ". therefore , @xmath99 and @xmath98 are comparable with each other in ca@xmath104la@xmath2cu@xmath22o@xmath23 , so that the metamagnetic transition takes place rather than the spin - flop transition .",
    "these results remind us that the magnetic interaction in the edge - sharing cuo@xmath5 chain exhibits a remarkable change as a function of @xmath15 .      , of ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with @xmath9 1.5 and 1.67 in zero field and in a magnetic field of 9 t parallel to the @xmath35- , @xmath7- and @xmath39-axes . ]",

    "the broad peak observed around 10 k in zero field suggests the formation of a spin - glass state , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii b. the peak does not change by the application of a magnetic field of 9 t parallel to the @xmath35- , @xmath7- and @xmath39-axes .",
    "this may be reasonable , because the magnetic field of 9 t is much smaller than @xmath105 which brings about short - range magnetic order . for @xmath10 and 1.67 , in fact",
    ", @xmath106 has been estimated as 80 k@xcite .",
    "it is found that the spin - gap state in @xmath11 is also not affected by the application of magnetic field .",
    "this is also reasonable , because the spin gap , @xmath107 , is expected to be much larger than 9 t. in fact , it has been found that @xmath108 in the similar edge - sharing cuo@xmath5 chain of sr@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath23 is as large as @xmath12 100 k@xcite .",
    "therefore , a possible peak of the specific heat due to the spin - gap formation in @xmath11 may be located at a much higher temperature than the observed broad peak and hidden by the large contribution of @xmath88 .",
    "figures [ fig:10](f ) and ( l ) show the magnetization curve of ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with @xmath9 1.5 and 1.67 at 4 k in magnetic fields up to 14 t parallel to the @xmath7- , @xmath35- and @xmath39-axes .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence looks like a paramagnetic one .",
    "the paramagnetic behavior in @xmath10 may be due to the weak interaction between short - range magnetically ordered regions in the spin - glass state , because the magnetization in @xmath10 is much larger than that in @xmath11 where the spin - glass phase is a minor one .",
    "as for @xmath11 , on the other hand , the strong suppression of the magnetic susceptibility suggestive of the spin - gap formation is observed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and discussed above .",
    "the suppression is also observed in the magnetization curve .",
    "however , the magnetization curve does not exhibit any kink up to 14 t , suggestive of the close of the spin gap , but the paramagnetic behavior due to a minor phase of the spin - glass .",
    "this is reasonable , because @xmath107 is speculated to be much larger than 14 t as discussed from the specific heat measurements .",
    "we have succeeded in growing large - size single - crystals of ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 with @xmath4 by the tsfz method and measured the magnetic susceptibility , specific heat and magnetization curve . in @xmath6 ,",
    "an antiferromagnetic phase transition with the magnetic easy axis along the @xmath7-axis has been detected in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements and a spin - flop transition has been observed in the magnetization curve .",
    "it has been found that @xmath37 decreases with increasing @xmath8 and disappears around @xmath109 .",
    "alternatively , a spin - glass phase appears around @xmath10 .",
    "the spin - glass state in @xmath53 and 1.67 may be due to a minor phase . at @xmath11 where the hole concentration is @xmath12 1/3 per cu",
    ", the pretty small magnetic susceptibility has indicated that a spin - gap state due to the formation of spin - singlet pairs seems to emerge as a main phase .",
    "no sign of the coexistence of an antiferromagnetically ordered state and a spin - gap state suggested in ca@xmath13cuo@xmath5 has been found in ca@xmath0y@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
