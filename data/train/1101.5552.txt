    "asymptotic freedom of yang - mills theories @xcite  the weakening of the strong force at asymptotically short distances  is a central characteristics of the standard model . within a renormalisation group language ,",
    "asymptotic freedom is signaled by a trivial ultraviolet fixed point with vanishing yang - mills coupling .",
    "this pattern is at the root of the existence of yang - mills theory as an asymptotic perturbative series valid for high energies , i.e.  energies much larger than the dynamical strong - coupling scale , @xmath0 , and makes the high energy behaviour accessible with weak coupling methods .",
    "it is well - known , however , that this feature can be destabilized once the couplings to matter degrees of freedom are taken into account , leading to constraints for the latter to ensure asymptotic freedom within the sm and its various extensions .",
    "less is known about the stability of asymptotic freedom under the inclusion of gravity .",
    "recently , quantum gravitational corrections to the yang - mills coupling have been studied perturbatively to one - loop order in newton s coupling @xcite , by treating gravity as an effective theory amended by an ultraviolet cutoff of the order of the planck scale @xcite ( see @xcite for earlier work ) .",
    "the strength of this technique is that quantum gravitational fluctuations can be computed in the low energy regime without the knowledge of the underlying quantum theory for gravity .",
    "asymptotic freedom remains intact in these studies and extensions thereof including compact extra dimensions @xcite and a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "these one - loop results have recently been confirmed beyond perturbation theory in @xcite .",
    "the findings open up a number of farther reaching questions .",
    "the one - loop graviton contribution to the yang - mills @xmath1-function comes out regularisation- and gauge - fixing dependent , which raises the question about its universality .",
    "it has also been argued that the one - loop coefficient is not invariant under re - parameterisations in field space , and hence not a measurable quantity @xcite . for specific gauges or regularisations",
    "a vanishing one - loop coefficient has been found , and a computation beyond the one - loop level becomes mandatory .",
    "also , the applicability of the effective theory is confined to the regime of weak gravity and strong coupling effects will become important and should be taken into account for energies approaching the planck scale .",
    "finally , at planck - scale energies and beyond , an effective theory description is superseded by a fundamental theory for gravity , and the ultimate fate of asymptotic freedom for yang - mills theory then depends on the ultraviolet completion for gravity .    in this letter",
    ", we study yang - mills theory coupled to gravity with the help of the functional renormalisation group @xcite ( see @xcite for a related study ) .",
    "this technique is based on the infinitesimal integrating - out of momentum modes from a path integral representation of quantum field theory by means of an infrared momentum cutoff .",
    "the renormalisation group flow links the fundamental theory with the corresponding quantum effective action at low energies .",
    "a particular strength of this method is its flexibility , allowing for perturbative and non - perturbative approximations . in the past",
    ", it has been applied to yang - mills theory @xcite and gravity @xcite individually , both at weak and strong coupling , which makes it an ideal tool for the study of the coupled system @xcite .    in the weak gravity limit ,",
    "we analyse the gravitational corrections to yang mills theory for general regularisations and backgrounds .",
    "gauge and diffeomorphism invariance of the effective action is achieved using the background field method .",
    "we evaluate the background field independence of our results by extending earlier explicit results within gauge yang mills theory @xcite to quantum gravity . in this general setting the gravitational contribution to the running gauge coupling",
    "is computed at one - loop .",
    "the result encompasses all previous studies , also including a cosmological constant .",
    "we also address asymptotic freedom in the limit where the graviton anomalous dimension can become large . here , we are particularily interested in the asymptotic safety scenario for gravity @xcite",
    ". we also evaluate asymptotic freedom in the scenario where quantum gravity is shielded by black hole formation @xcite .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows .",

    ". a detailed discussion of the background field dependence is given ( sec .",

    "our results are compared with earlier findings in perturbation theory at the one - loop order ( sec .",
    "[ pt ] ) . beyond one - loop , we study the leading gravitational corrections to yang - mills in the presence of a gravitational fixed point ( sec .",
    "[ gfp ] ) and in the presence of a cosmological constant term ( sec .",
    "we close with a brief discussion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "the functional renormalisation group is based on a momentum cutoff for the propagating degrees of freedom and describes the change of the scale - dependent effective action @xmath2 under an infinitesimal change of the cutoff scale @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thereby it interpolates between a microscopic action in the ultraviolet and the full quantum effective action in the infrared , where the cutoff is removed . in its modern formulation ,",
    "the renormalisation group flow of @xmath2 with the logarithmic scale parameter @xmath4 is given by wetterich s flow equation @xcite @xmath5 the trace stands for a sum over indices and a loop integration , and @xmath6 ( not to be confused with the ricci scalar @xmath7 ) is an appropriately defined momentum cutoff at the momentum scale @xmath8 .",
    "the effective action depends on the metric field @xmath9 , the gauge field @xmath10 including possible abelian factors , and the related ghosts @xmath11 and @xmath12 for metric field and gauge field respectively . in short",
    "we have @xmath13 $ ] , where the fields are put into a superfield @xmath14 .",
    "the action may also depend on specifically chosen , non - propagating background fields @xmath15 .",
    "in quantum gravity , the introduction of a background metric is necessary as one has to fix a gauge , or more generally , one has to choose a specific parameterisation of the configuration space .",
    "this fact is at the root of the problem of background independence of quantum gravity .",
    "the flow equation is derived from the insertion of infrared cut - off terms in the path integral , @xmath16=\\012 \\int d^d x\\sqrt{\\bar g}\\ ,    ( \\phi-\\bar \\phi)_i\\ , r_k^{ij}[\\bar\\phi]\\ , ( \\phi-\\bar \\phi)_j\\,,\\ ] ] where the regulator @xmath6 is a matrix in field space and may also couple different species of fields , in particular metric and gauge fields , and may depend on the background @xmath15 . note that the background metric dependence in via @xmath17 is necessary to keep the one loop nature of the flow equation .",
    "furthermore the contraction of the spin one and spin two components in @xmath18 also depend on the background metric .",
    "the rhs .  of the flow equation consists of one loop diagrams with full field - dependent propagators multiplied with the scale derivative of the regulator .",
    "this entails that for computing a @xmath19-loop effective action one has to insert the @xmath20-loop effective action on the rhs .",
    "if interested in the one loop effective action we therefore have to insert the classical action on the rhs .",
    "the structure of the flow equation is such that standard perturbation theory is recovered to all loop orders by iteration @xcite .",
    "gauge and diffeomorphism symmetry is encoded in the related slavnov - taylor identities @xcite .",
    "these symmetry identities are modified in the presence of the regulator term . in the vanishing cut - off limit , @xmath21",
    ", the modifications also vanish and we are left with the standard symmetry identities .",
    "furthermore , there are combined transformations of both , the background @xmath15 and the fluctuation @xmath18 , which leaves the effective action invariant .",
    "it is for that reason that @xmath22=\\gamma_k[\\phi,\\phi]\\,\\ ] ] is both , gauge and diffeomorphism invariant .",

    "the gauge and diffeomorphism invariant action , , is defined as @xmath23=\\gamma_k[\\phi,\\phi]$ ] where the gauge fixing term and a part of @xmath27 vanishes . due to quantum fluctuations , all couplings have become running couplings and depend on the infrared rg - scale @xmath3 : the running newton coupling @xmath28 , the running cosmological constant @xmath29 , and the running yang - mills coupling @xmath30 .",
    "further quantum corrections such as higher order curvature invariants and further matter - gravity interaction terms can be generated as well and are contained in @xmath27 .    in the present work",
    "we discuss the running of the fundamental dimensionless couplings of the theory , the yang - mills coupling and the dimensionless newton coupling , @xmath31 the running is encoded in the respective @xmath1-functions ( @xmath32 ) as @xmath33 the above equations , reflect the fact that in a background field approach the running couplings run inversely to the wave - function renormalisations @xmath34 of the respective fields .",
    "the running of the @xmath34 s splits into a pure yang - mills part ( only yang - mills loops / fluctuations ) and a gravity part that also contains internal graviton lines , @xmath35 in the present work we are specifically interested in the sign @xmath36 , since @xmath37 is proportional to the yang - mills coupling and tends to zero in the uv if asymptotic freedom is present .",
    "hence , for @xmath38 at vanishing ym - coupling , asymptotic freedom is supported by quantum gravity corrections , whereas for @xmath39 it is spoiled .",
    "so far we have not specified the regulator @xmath6 .",
    "indeed the full effective action at @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 ) can not depend on this choice , however at finite @xmath42 with @xmath6 there will be a @xmath3-dependence . in the following we shall exploit this freedom to disentangle gravity and gauge theory at one loop . to that end",

    "the dimensionless regulator functions @xmath44 depend on covariant laplacians in the presence of the background @xmath47 .",
    "we specify @xmath48 all other components vanish .",
    "regulator functions @xmath49 with are diagonal .",
    "they only connect the metric and gauge field with themselves and gosts with anti - ghosts .",
    "note that this is the minimal form of regulator functions that suppress all infrared ( or ultraviolet ) propagation of all fields .",
    "dropping one of the components in leads to full quantum propagation of the related field .",
    "hence , the above choice naturally disentangles the yang - mills and gravitational sectors , and is therefore well - suited for our analysis .",

    "we observe that for the cutoff choice with diagonal @xmath49 in , the one loop flow disentangles .",

    "cross - terms leading to gravity loops for i.e.  the gauge field propagators or gauge field loops for the graviton propagators are absent .",
    "the full one - loop effective action is then given by @xmath58=\\gamma_\\lambda[\\phi]+\\012   \\int_\\lambda^0 \\0{dk}{k}\\tr\\ , \\0{1}{1+r[\\phi]}\\partial_t r[\\phi]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath59=\\gamma_{k=0 } [ \\phi]$ ] .",
    "it follows from that for the class of cutoff functions the full @xmath1-function of the background gauge coupling , @xmath60 , in the presence of gravitational fluctuations is given by the standard result without gravity @xmath61 up to corrections starting at the 2-loop level .",
    "beyond one loop , the potential structural disentanglement no longer holds true : @xmath62 is not diagonal and hence entangles yang - mills and gravity sector .",
    "the functional renormalisation group approach of sec .",
    "iii allows us to classify and understand the scheme dependence of the @xmath1-functions of a general matter - gravity system . in particular",
    "this allows us to explain the scheme dependences observed so far for the yang - mills  gravity theory , as well as to extract the physics stored in the @xmath1-functions , @xmath63  the uv stability of the coupled system .",
    "we note in this context that the functional rg set - up also covers the standard perturbative regularisation schemes such as momentum cutoff , dimensional , pauli - villars , or heat kernel regularisation .",
    "scheme dependences of @xmath1-functions in the background field approach have already been studied for general field theories @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the ym - coupling receives contributions from the background field dependence of the regularisation .",

    "therefore we conclude that in general graviton contributions to the regularisation - induced background dependence of the effective action are created .",
    "we have already argued that for the regularisation schemes diagonal in @xmath49 defined in , the graviton - contribution to the @xmath1-function of the background field defined via vanishes .",

    "regularisations which induce a mixing between gravity and yang - mills fields are expected to give a non - vanishing contribution already at one - loop for all @xmath1-functions .",
    "the above arguments entail that the background @xmath1-functions of the coupled ym - gravity system are scheme - dependent even at one - loop .",
    "note , however , that the uv stability of the ym - gravity system is solely controlled by the signs of the @xmath1-functions of the fluctuation fields .    in conclusion , the following picture has emerged .",
    "uv stability of the ym sector relates to the ( negative ) sign of the @xmath1-function for the fluctuating gluon .",
    "this information can be extracted directly from the correlation functions of the fluctuating gluons .",
    "alternatively , one can exploit the fact that the regularisation - independent part of the @xmath1-function of the background coupling carries the same sign .",

    "here we put forward a computation of the ym @xmath1-function , which differs from the previous studies in two aspects @xcite : firstly , the analysis is performed for trivial backgrounds @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "secondly , we employ classes of momentum cutoffs with a tensorial structure different from .",
    "the result complements our previous findings and allows to make close contact with all previous 1-loop studies @xcite as well as the flow study @xcite .",
    "this also allows us to make use of the fact that loop contributions of fluctuating gravitons to the correlation functions of the fluctuating gluons and to the background gluons agree : the vertices of the two fields are derived only from the classical ym - action and not from the ghost and gauge fixing terms .",
    "the classical ym - action only depends on @xmath72 and hence derivatives w.r.t .",
    "the background fields @xmath47 and w.r.t . the fluctuation fields @xmath73 agree . in other words , the two possibilities of how to compute the graviton contribution to the @xmath1-function of the fluctuating gluon agree .",
    "we emphasise that this does not hold for the gluon contribution to the @xmath1-function of the fluctuating graviton .",

    "a general regularisation scheme may break explicitly or implicitly the relation as it modifies either the propagation or the dynamics of the theory , or both , by cut - off effects .",

    "this entails that the gauge fixing parameter runs like the wave function renormalisation , @xmath121 .",

    "hence , @xmath114 is only independent of @xmath79 for @xmath132 , which is equivalent to the constraint @xmath133 the constraint implies that @xmath134 has to vanish for finite @xmath135 .",
    "consequently , @xmath136 is a sharp cutoff for momenta where @xmath135 .",
    "legitimate choices are for example @xmath137 , or @xmath138 and @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "the sharp and optimised regulators are defined as @xmath140 and the heaviside step function @xmath141 .",
    "note that regulators with the constraint effectively satisfy the symmetry constraint : if the graviton legs in are contracted with graviton propagators , we are lead to . in turn , without graviton propagators the constraint necessitates @xmath142 .    we summarise the above analysis as follows : we have computed the one loop gravity contributions @xmath36 to the yang - mills @xmath1-function for general regularisation schemes .",
    "the one - loop gravitational contribution to the running of the ym coupling is regularisation - dependent , and thus non - universal .",
    "this originates from the mass dimension inherent to the gravitational coupling .",
    "however , @xmath143 is negative semi - definite and hence sustains asymptotic freedom .",
    "it vanishes in symmetry - preserving regularisation schemes based on the symmetry relation .",
    "in this section we extend the stability analysis of asymptotic freedom to include general field - theory - based gravity scenarios @xcite . in some of these",
    ", short distance physics is shielded by black hole formation @xcite . provided",
    "this happens at scales where the anomalous dimension of the graviton @xmath115 is still small , the weak coupling analysis of the previous section is sufficient to sustain asymptotic freedom of yang mills .",
    "however , since the graviton anomalous dimension @xmath115 might grow large due to strong quantum gravity effects , it is important to evaluate the stability of asymptotic freedom for general @xmath115 .    from the rg - equation for @xmath144 ,",
    ", we note that the value @xmath145 is distinguished because the @xmath1-function for the dimensionless newton coupling @xmath144 vanishes .",
    "this is the gravitational fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario for gravity @xcite . in its vicinity ,",
    "the gravitational @xmath1-function changes sign .",
    "therefore the three cases @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are qualitatively different and will be discussed separately .",
    "we first discuss the impact of a gravitational fixed point @xmath145 for asymptotic freedom of yang - mills by evaluating the gravitational contribution @xmath148 , .",
    "the related coefficient @xmath120 in becomes @xmath149 and the coefficient @xmath150 is given by . with the coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath150 and the assumption of asymptotic freedom , @xmath151 at the fixed point , the @xmath1-function at the fixed point reads @xmath152 as for the one loop running , @xmath153 is not universal since the coefficients @xmath154 depend on the choices for the regulators @xmath155 .",
    "asymptotic freedom only enforces @xmath156 which implies @xmath157 the latter case is irrelevant here as @xmath158 can only be obtained for the singular choices @xmath159 . for the symmetry preserving choices we have @xmath160 and",
    "we arrive at a vanishing non - perturbative gravity contribution for the yang - mills @xmath1-function , @xmath161 .    in the general case",
    "we have to satisfy the constraint in relating @xmath150 and @xmath162 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to regulators with @xmath163 as this limits the size of the back - reaction of the gluon on the graviton .",
    "then , @xmath150 in satisfies @xmath164 where @xmath165 with @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "we have also used that @xmath167 . due to",
    "the bound the first set of constraints in is satisfied for @xmath168 the bound for @xmath162 is safely satisfied for general regulators @xmath136 .",
    "indeed , the generic value for the fixed point coupling is of order one .",
    "for example , for the pure gravity system one finds @xmath169 for an optimised regulator and @xmath122 .",
    "note also in this context that @xmath170 is approximately constant for all @xmath79 .",
    "if we relax the locality condition for the gluon , that is @xmath171 , one enhances the gluon fluctuations . in this case one",
    "has to take into account the back - reaction of the gluon fluctuations on the fixed point value of the newton coupling .",
    "here we only remark that in the full system indeed one can show that @xmath172 is always satisfied .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail elsewhere .",
    "in summary we find that the graviton contribution @xmath36 sustains asymptotic freedom @xmath173 hence the ultraviolet fixed point action of yang - mills theory is given by the classical action and we can invoke leading to @xmath174 .",
    "this leads us to the final value of the non - perturbative @xmath1-function if all symmetries are respected , @xmath175 we conclude that the gauge coupling remains asymptotically free , even in the presence of a non - perturbative gravitational fixed point .",
    "next we turn to @xmath146 . in this case",
    "@xmath120 might turn negative , see .",
    "however , with we have @xmath176 and @xmath177 decreases exponentially with logarithmic rg scale @xmath4 , and so does the gravity contribution to @xmath114 in .",
    "we conclude that even though the gravity contribution to @xmath114 might be positive for @xmath146 , its exponential decay would eventually lead to the dominance of @xmath178 .",
    "thus , asymptotic freedom would persist .",
    "note also that @xmath146 for @xmath179 is equivalent with a gauian uv fixed point which is not present in gravity .",
    "finally , for @xmath147 the dimensionless newton coupling @xmath177 grows exponentially with @xmath46 , see , and the coefficient @xmath120 is positive .",
    "this case includes classical gravity with @xmath180 as well as a gravitational shielding scenario .",
    "the constraints enforce @xmath181 to ensure asymptotic freedom for yang - mills .",
    "this puts an upper limit on the value of dimensionless newton coupling which has to be satisfied by eg .",
    "perturbation theory or a gravitational shielding scenario , or else @xmath177 de - stabilizes asymptotic freedom .",
    "note that this bound depends on the regularisation scheme as does the definition of the dimensionless newton constant @xmath177 .",
    "in summary we have shown that asymptotic freedom persists in general field - theory - based gravity scenarios .",
    "we proceed by introducing a cosmological constant @xmath182 to the theory . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider the case @xmath122 , but the results readily extend to @xmath183 .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath120 and @xmath150 , , read @xmath184 where @xmath185 denotes the cosmological constant in units of the rg scale @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to the beta - function with the coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath150 in . as before we conclude that if invoking the symmetry relation leading to with @xmath186 , the coefficient function vanishes , @xmath187 , and we have no gravity contribution to the yang - mills running , @xmath188 it is left to prove the stability of this result under changes of the regulator , that is @xmath189 for all regulators .    as in the previous section we consider the qualitatively different cases @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "at the gravitational fixed point with @xmath145 and @xmath190 we find @xmath191 we have stability of the fixed point iff @xmath192 .",
    "evidently the integrand in is not positive but is negative for small momenta @xmath193 and turns positive for @xmath194 . for regulators , we find stability for @xmath195 . for general regulators",
    "one has to solve the integral equation @xmath120 numerically resulting in @xmath196 and the constraint @xmath197 .",
    "the regulator - dependence of the critical cosmological constant is not surprising as the value of the cosmological constant ( and the newton constant ) at the fixed point is not a physical observable .",
    "the important result is the existence of such a constraint .    for @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    "we run into the same scenarios as in the previous section with the coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath150 .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath147 we require @xmath198 which puts constraints on @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "as one can assume @xmath201 due to the canonical running in this regime , they are less severe than the one in the asymptotic safety scenario .",
    "first we compare our results with previous findings to leading order in perturbation theory in the @xmath202 and @xmath203 cases @xcite . identifying the energy scale @xmath204 with the cutoff scale @xmath3",
    ", the one - loop gravitational correction can be written as @xmath205 our result corresponds to the coefficient @xmath206 as given in .",
    "within dimensional regularisation and using the background field method , deser  et .",
    "@xcite found no gravitational corrections to the yang - mills and maxwell @xmath1-functions , respectively , and hence @xmath207 . in the @xmath202 case",
    ", the same conclusion is reached by pietrykowski @xcite by evaluating the gauge fixing dependence in a generalised @xmath208 gauge , and by toms @xcite within the geometrical effective action method . in the @xmath203 case ,",
    "ebert , plefka and rodigast @xcite confirmed @xmath207 based on dimensional regularisation and cutoff regularisation with feynman gauge for the gluon and de donder gauge for the graviton .",
    "this study shows that quadratic divergences , neglected within dimensional regularisation , cancel out within a sharp cutoff regularisation .    on the other hand , robinson and wilzcek @xcite , toms @xcite and daum et .",
    "@xcite find a non - vanishing contribution to leading order , @xmath209 .",
    "in particular , the result of robinson and wilczek @xcite is based on the feynman gauge @xmath210 and @xmath211 , leading to @xmath212 in . a positive coefficient @xmath213 has also been found by toms @xcite using a modified version of the vilkovisky de - witt approach .",
    "the study of daum , harst and reuter @xcite is based on the background field method , together with a wilsonian momentum cutoff for the propagating modes , with @xmath214\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath215 parametrises the shape of the momentum cutoff .",
    "the coefficient is non - universal and strictly positive , @xmath216 , as @xmath217 . as has been argued in sec .",
    "[ bfd ] , the background field approach used in this study does also include terms originating in the background field dependence of the regulator . for the symmetry - preserving cut - off choice @xmath218 with the coefficient",
    "diverges in clear contradistinction to our result @xmath219=0 $ ] .",
    "this difference can be solely attributed to the field - dependence of the cut - off function which enters .    in the presence of a cosmological constant ,",
    "a recent study based on a diffeomorphism invariant expansion scheme using the geometric effective action finds a non - vanishing result to one - loop order @xcite .",
    "the expansion scheme used in this approach differs from the standard one as eg .",
    "already the yang mills classical propagator is massive with a mass proportional to the cosmological constant .",
    "we emphasize that the symmetry preserving scheme employed here also leads to a vanishing coefficient in this set - up , @xmath207 .",
    "based on the general considerations underlying our rg result , we can acertain that the gauge - fixing and regularisation - dependent coefficient @xmath220 .",
    "as long as the implicit or explicit regularisation respects the symmetry relation , the result reads @xmath207 .",
    "note in this context that regularisations such as pauli - villars , or other gauges such as a general @xmath208 gauge , do not respect the symmetry constraint .",
    "we also remark that in the computation of a non - universal coefficient one can not tell apart regularisation and gauge - fixing dependences .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that different regularisations and gauges lead to different coefficients @xmath221 .",
    "we conclude that all existing studies agree in that the gravitational contribution to the yang - mills @xmath1-function support asymptotic freedom .",
    "the one - loop approximation is valid in the weak gravity regime .",
    "close to the planck scale and beyond , the dynamics within the gravitational sector becomes relevant .",
    "we have shown that asymptotic freedom persists for general anomalous dimension @xmath115 , which entails its compatibility with general field - theory - based gravity scenarios .",
    "this includes gravitational shielding as well as asymptotically safe gravity .    in conclusion ,",
    "provided that all symmetries and in particular are preserved , the graviton induced running of the yang - mills coupling vanishes , @xmath222 this result stays valid in the presence of a cosmological constant , and in the presence of a gravitational fixed point .",
    "hence , it will be interesting to extend this study to the fully coupled yang - mills gravity system .",
