    "unified models of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) posit orientation and intrinsic luminosity as the two primary physical parameters governing the optical characteristics of an active galaxy ( antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . according to these models , when the obscuring torus of an agn is oriented perpendicular to the observer line of sight , one sees spatially - unresolved , doppler - boosted emission from hot gas near the central supermassive black hole in the form of broad ( fwhm @xmath7 ) , high - ionization emission lines and synchrotron emission from the central nucleus in the form of power - law ultraviolet / optical continuum emission .",
    "independent of orientation one sees narrow emission lines ( fwhm @xmath8 ) from the spatially - extended narrow - line region .",
    "when the line of sight to the central engine is blocked by the torus , only the extended narrow - line emission is seen .",
    "active galaxies without observed broad emission lines but with high - ionization species are classified as type  ii systems , while those with broad line emission are classified type  i. in addition to the narrow line region , hard x - ray , far - infrared , and radio emission from agn are also largely immune to obscuration and orientation effects .",
    "intrinsic , unobscured luminosity , or activity level , is the second primary physical parameter differentiating agn .",
    "the most luminous active galaxies ( @xmath9 ) , where light from the central regions overwhelm evidence of the underlying stellar populations , are identified as quasars ( qsos ) . at lower luminosity ( @xmath10 )",
    ", seyfert galaxies show evidence of both host galaxy stellar emission and radiation from the central agn .",
    "finally , surveys of local galaxies find a class of sources with very low power , low - ionization nuclear emitting regions , liners , which are likely the lethargic cousins of the luminous active galaxies .",
    "about one thind of all galaxies show evidence of low - power agns , seen in the form of either liners or low - luminosity seyferts ( ho 1999 ) .",
    "this briefly - described unification model is supported by a variety of observations , including reverberation mapping , polarization studies , and mapping of the ionized gas morphology .",
    "surveys of bright galaxies have characterized the local demographics of agn : the fraction of field galaxies which are classified as seyferts rises from approximately @xmath11% at @xmath12 to essentially all galaxies at @xmath13 ( meurs 1982 ; meurs & wilson 1984 ) .",

    "the abundance of type  ii qsos at high redshift is of considerable interest for models of the x - ray background ( xrb ) .",

    "deep , multi - band imaging surveys are also sensitive to high - redshift , type - ii quasars : though they are significantly fainter than unobscured quasars , type - ii quasars are readily identified in surveys for distant galaxies . indeed , as mentioned in  2.1 , cxo52 was initially identified in this manner , prior to _ chandra _ imaging of the lynx field .",

    "<S> we report on observations of a type  ii quasar at redshift @xmath0 , identified as a hard x - ray source in a 185  ks observation with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and as a high - redshift photometric candidate from deep , multiband optical imaging . </S>",
    "<S> cxo  j084837.9 + 445352 ( hereinafter cxo52 ) shows an unusually hard x - ray spectrum from which we infer an absorbing column density @xmath1 @xmath2 ( 90% confidence ) and an implied unabsorbed 2@xmath310 kev rest - frame luminosity of @xmath4 , well within the quasar regime . _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> imaging shows cxo52 to be elongated with slight morphological differences between the wfpc2 f814w and nicmos f160w bands . </S>",
    "<S> optical and near - infrared spectroscopy of cxo52 show high - ionization emission lines with velocity widths @xmath5 and flux ratios similar to a seyfert  2 galaxy or radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are the only class of high - redshift type  ii luminous agn which have been extensively studied to date . unlike radio galaxies , however , cxo52 is radio quiet , remaining undetected at radio wavelengths to fairly deep limits , @xmath6jy . </S>",
    "<S> high - redshift type  ii quasars , expected from unification models of active galaxies and long - thought necessary to explain the x - ray background , are poorly constrained observationally with few such systems known . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss recent observations of similar type  ii quasars and detail search techniques for such systems : namely ( 1 ) x - ray selection , ( 2 ) radio selection , ( 3 ) multi - color imaging selection , and ( 4 ) narrow - band imaging selection . </S>",
    "<S> such studies are likely to begin identifying luminous , high - redshift type  ii systems in large numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the prospects for these studies and their implications to our understanding of the x - ray background . </S>"
