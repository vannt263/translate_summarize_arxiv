    "algorithmic motion planning in robotics is a well established discipline which provides ( 1 ) a wide variety of general - purpose efficient theoretical algorithms , ( 2 ) more efficient algorithms designed for a number of special situations and ( 3 ) some practical solutions which work reasonably well in fairly involved scenarios .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a recent survey and to @xcite for a comprehensive textbook .    in general ,",
    "one is given a moving system @xmath6 with @xmath7 degrees of freedom and a two or three - dimensional workspace @xmath8 .",
    "the geometry of @xmath6 and of @xmath8 is given in advance which determines the configuration space of the system , @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is a subset of @xmath9 consisting of all placements ( or configurations ) of the system @xmath6 , each represented by a tuple of @xmath7 real parameters , such that in this placement @xmath6 lies fully in @xmath8 . for simplicity we may restrict our attention to a single connected component of @xmath6 , the one containing a prescribed initial placement of @xmath6 .",
    "being a subset of the euclidean space @xmath9 , the configuration space @xmath2 naturally inherits its _",
    "topology_. many questions of control theory depend solely on the configuration space @xmath2 viewed as a topological space .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that different control problems could be treated simultaneously for all systems having homeomorphic configuration spaces .",
    "it is well - known that any real analytic manifold can be realized as the configuration space of a simple mechanical system ( linkage )",
    ". therefore topological questions of robotics lead to interesting new topological invariants of abstract manifolds .",
    "we are interested in motion planning algorithms which work as follows : the algorithm gets as its input the present and the desired states of the system and it produces as the output a continuous motion of the system from its current state to the desired state .",
    "it turns out that the topology of the configuration space of the system imposes important restrictions on the discontinuities of the robot motion as a function of the input data .",
    "we emphasize that these are not discontinuities of the robot motion as a function of time .",
    "the discontinuities which we study here are in the way the decision ( the whole motion ) depends on the input data .",
    "the approach to the motion planning problem described in @xcite , @xcite was initially inspired by my discussions with dan halperin and micha sharir in 2000 .",
    "it was also influenced by the well - known previous work of s. smale @xcite on algorithms of finding roots of algebraic equations .",
    "our results on topological robotics were published in mathematical journals @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "they led to an interesting new topological invariant @xmath0 of topological spaces . in robotics applications , the number @xmath0 has at least three different appearances .",
    "firstly , it is the minimal number of domains of continuity of any motion planning algorithm for a system having @xmath2 as its configuration space .",
    "secondly , it is the minimal _ order of instability _ ( see @xcite ) which have motion planning algorithms in @xmath2 .",
    "the third interpretation ( see  [ sec : random ] below ) allows to measure @xmath0 while relying on _ random _ motion planning algorithms : we show that @xmath0 is the minimal integer @xmath1 such that there exists an @xmath1 valued random motion planning algorithm for the system .",
    "the main part of the paper is devoted to a very specific motion planning problem : simultaneous control of many objects whose motion is restricted by a graph and the goal is to construct a motion planning algorithm avoiding collisions between the objects .",
    "this problem was initially studied by r. ghrist , d. koditschek and a. abrams @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we calculate here the topological complexity of the problem and describe an explicit motion planning algorithm solving it .    for convenience of the reader",
    "we have included sections   [ sec : one ] - [ sec : five ] which give a brief description of some results of @xcite , @xcite used later in this paper .",
    "consider a mechanical system ( robot ) controlled by a motion planning algorithm .",
    "it is supposed to function as follows : an operator introduces into the computer of the system the current and the desired states of the system and the motion planning algorithm determines a continuous motion of the system from its current state to the desired state .",
    "let @xmath2 be the configuration space of the system .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath2 is path connected , i.e. any pair of points @xmath10 may be joined by a continuous path @xmath11 in @xmath2 .",
    "this means that it is possible to bring our system , by a continuous movement , from any given configuration @xmath12 to any given configuration @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption does not represent a restriction since in practical situations when the natural configuration space of a given system has several connected components , we may simply restrict our attention to one of them .    given two points @xmath14 , one wants to connect them by a path in @xmath2 ; this path represents a continuous motion of the system from one state to the other .",
    "a motion planning algorithm is a rule ( algorithm ) that takes pairs of configurations @xmath15 as an input and produces a continuous path in @xmath2 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 as an output .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the space of all continuous paths @xmath17 \\to x$ ] , equipped with the compact - open topology , and let @xmath18 be the map assigning the end points to a path : @xmath19 . rephrasing the above discussion we see that a motion planning algorithm is a _ section _ of this fibration @xmath20 here @xmath21 denotes the identity map .",
    "the algorithm associates the curve @xmath22 , where @xmath23 $ ] , with any two given configurations of the system @xmath10 .",
    "given a mechanical system , one asks _ does there exist a continuous motion planning algorithm for it _ ?",
    "in other words , whether it is possible to find a continuous section ( [ section1 ] ) .",
    "the answer is negative in most cases as the following theorem proven in @xcite states :    [ contract ] a globally defined continuous motion planning algorithm ( [ section1 ] ) exists if and only if the configuration space @xmath2 of the system is contractible .",
    "in view of theorem [ contract ] , one expects that in general a motion planning algorithm is only _",
