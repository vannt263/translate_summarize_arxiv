    "black holes are the most extreme objects known in the universe .",
    "our representations of physical laws reach their limits in them .",
    "the strange phenomena that occur around black holes put to the test our basic conceptions of space , time , determinism , irreversibility , information , and causality .",
    "it is then not surprising that the investigation of black holes has philosophical impact in areas as diverse as ontology , epistemology , and theory construction . in black holes , in a very definite sense",
    ", we can say that philosophy meets experiment .",
    "but , alas , philosophers have almost paid no attention to the problems raised by the existence of black holes in the real world ( for a notable and solitary exception see weingard 1979 ; a recent discussion of some ontological implications of black holes can be found in romero & prez 2014 ) .",
    "the purpose of this chapter is to palliate this omission and to provide a survey of some important philosophical issues related to black holes .",
    "i do not purport to deliver an exhaustive study ; such a task would demand a whole book devoted to the topic .",
    "rather , i would like to set path for future research , calling the attention to some specific problems .    in the next section",
    "i introduce the concept of a black hole .",
    "i do this from a space - time point of view , without connection to newtonian analogies .",
    "black holes are not black stars ; they are fully relativistic objects and can be understood only from a relativistic perspective .",
    "hence , i start saying a few things about space - time and relativity .    in the remaining sections of the chapter i present and discuss several philosophical issues raised by the existence and properties of black holes . in particular",
    ", i discuss what happens with determinism and predictability in black holes space - times , the implications of the existence of black holes for ontological views of time and the nature of reality , the role of black holes in the irreversibility we observe in the universe , issues related to information and whether it can be destroyed in black holes , the apparent breakdown of causality inside black holes , and , finally , the role played , if any , by black holes in the future of the universe .",
    "a black hole is a region of space - time , so i start introducing the concept of space - time ( minkowski 1908 ) . +",
    "* definition . *",
    "_ space - time is the emergent of the ontological composition of all events_. + events can be considered as primitives or can be derived from things as changes in their properties if things are taken as ontologically prior .",
    "both representations are equivalent since things can be construed as bundles of events ( romero 2013b ) .",
    "since composition is not a formal operation but an ontological one , space - time is neither a concept nor an abstraction , but an emergent entity . as any entity , space - time can be represented by a concept .",
    "the usual representation of space - time is given by a 4-dimensional real manifold @xmath0 equipped with a metric field @xmath1 :    @xmath2    it is important to stress that space - time _ is not _ a manifold ( i.e. a mathematical construct ) but the `` totality '' of events .",
    "a specific model of space - time requires the specification of the source of the metric field .",
    "this is done through another field , called the `` energy - momentum '' tensor field @xmath3 .",
    "hence , a model of space - time is :    @xmath4    the relation between these two tensor fields is given by field equations , which represent a basic physical law .",
    "the metric field specifies the geometry of space - time .",
    "the energy - momentum field represents the potential of change ( i.e. of event generation ) in space - time .",
    "all this can be cast into in the following axioms ( romero 2014b ) .",
    "+ @xmath5 the set @xmath0 is a @xmath6 differentiable , 4-dimensional , real pseudo - riemannian manifold .",
    "+ @xmath7 the metric structure of @xmath0 is given by a tensor field of rank 2 , @xmath1 , in such a way that the differential distance @xmath8 between two events is : @xmath9    @xmath10 the tangent space of @xmath0 at any point is minkowskian , i.e. its metric is given by a symmetric tensor @xmath11 of rank 2 and trace @xmath12 .",
    "+ @xmath13 the metric of @xmath0 is determined by a rank 2 tensor field @xmath3 through the following field equations :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a second rank tensor whose components are functions of the second derivatives of the metric . both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants .",
    "+ @xmath18 the elements of @xmath0 represent physical events .",
    "+ @xmath19 space - time is represented by an ordered pair @xmath20 : @xmath2    @xmath21 there is a non - geometrical field represented by a 2-rank tensor field @xmath3 on the manifold e. + @xmath22 a specific model of space - time is given by : @xmath23    so far no mention has been made of the gravitational field .",
    "the sketched theory is purely ontological , and hence , can not be yet identified with general relativity . to formulate the field equations we introduce the einstein tensor : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is",
    "the ricci tensor formed from second derivatives of the metric and @xmath26 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the geodesic equations for a test particle free in the gravitational field are : @xmath27 with @xmath28 an affine parameter and @xmath29 the affine connection , given by : @xmath30    the affine connection is not a tensor , but can be used to build a tensor that is directly associated with the curvature of space - time : the riemann tensor .",
    "the form of the riemann tensor for an affine - connected manifold can be obtained through a coordinate transformation @xmath31 that makes the affine connection to vanish everywhere , i.e.    @xmath32    the coordinate system @xmath33 exists if    @xmath34    for the affine connection @xmath35 . the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) is the riemann tensor : @xmath36    when @xmath37 the metric is flat , since its derivatives are zero . if the metric has positive curvature .",
    "sometimes it is said that the riemann tensor represents the gravitational field , since it only vanishes in the absence of fields . on the contrary",
    ", the affine connection can be set locally to zero by a transformation of coordinates .",
    "this fact , however , only reflects the equivalence principle : the gravitational field can be suppressed in any locally free falling system . in other words , the tangent space to the manifold that represents space - time is always minkowskian . to determine the mathematical object of the theory that represents the gravitational field we have to consider the weak field limit of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - einstein ] ) .",
    "when this is done we find that the gravitational potential is identified with the metric coefficient @xmath38 and the coupling constant @xmath17 is @xmath39 . if _",
    "the metric represents the gravitational potential _",
    ", then _ the affine connection represents the strength of the field itself_. this is similar to what happens in electrodynamics , where the 4-vector @xmath40 represents the electromagnetic potential and the tensor field @xmath41 represents the strength of the electromagnetic field . _ the riemann tensor , on the other hand , being formed by derivatives of the affine connection , represents the rate of change , both in space and time , of the strength of the gravitational field_.    the source of the gravitational field in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - einstein ] ) , the tensor field @xmath3 , stands for the physical properties of material things .",
    "it represents the energy and momentum of all non - gravitational systems . in the case of a point mass @xmath42 and assuming spherical symmetry , the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - einstein ] ) represents a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the schwarzschild solution for a static mass @xmath42 can be written in spherical coordinates @xmath43 as : @xmath44    the metric given by eq .",
    "( [ schw ] ) has some interesting properties .",
    "let s assume that the mass @xmath42 is concentrated at @xmath45 .",
    "there seems to be two singularities at which the metric diverges : one at @xmath45 and the other at @xmath46 the length @xmath47 is known as the _ schwarzschild radius _ of the object of mass @xmath42 . usually , at normal densities , @xmath47 is well inside the outer radius of the physical system , and the solution does not apply to the interior but only to the exterior of the object . for a point mass ,",
    "the schwarzschild radius is in the vacuum region and the entire space - time has the structure given by ( [ schw ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that strange things occur close to @xmath48 .",
    "for instance , for the proper time we get : @xmath49 or @xmath50    when @xmath51 both times agree , so @xmath52 is interpreted as the proper time measure from an infinite distance . as the system with",
    "proper time @xmath53 approaches to @xmath48 , @xmath54 tends to infinity according to eq .",
    "( [ time2 ] ) .",
    "the object never reaches the schwarzschild surface when seen by an infinitely distant observer .",
    "the closer the object is to the schwarzschild radius , the slower it moves for the external observer .",
    "a direct consequence of the difference introduced by gravity in the local time with respect to the time at infinity is that the radiation that escapes from a given @xmath55 will be redshifted when received by a distant and static observer . since the frequency ( and hence the energy ) of the photon",
    "depend on the time interval , we can write , from eq .",
    "( [ time2 ] ) : @xmath56 since the redshift is : @xmath57 then @xmath58 and we see that when @xmath59 the redshift becomes infinite .",
    "this means that a photon needs infinite energy to escape from inside the region determined by @xmath47 .",
    "events that occur at @xmath60 are disconnected from the rest of the universe .",
    "the surface determined by @xmath61 is an _",
    "event horizon_. whatever crosses the event horizon will never return .",
    "this is the origin of the expression `` black hole '' , introduced by john a. wheeler in the mid 1960s .",
    "the black hole is the region of space - time inside the event horizon .    according to eq .",
    "( [ schw ] ) , there is a divergence at @xmath61 .",
    "the metric coefficients , however , can be made regular by a change of coordinates .",
    "for instance we can consider eddington - finkelstein coordinates .",
    "let us define a new radial coordinate @xmath62 such that radial null rays satisfy @xmath63 .",
    "( [ schw ] ) we can show that : @xmath64 then , we introduce : @xmath65 the new coordinate @xmath66 can be used as a time coordinate replacing @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ schw ] ) .",
    "this yields : @xmath67 or @xmath68 where @xmath69     is the schwarzschild radius where the event horizon is located ( units @xmath70).,width=264 ]    notice that in eq .",
    "( [ ef ] ) the metric is non - singular at @xmath71 .",
    "the only real singularity is at @xmath45 , since there the riemann tensor diverges . in order to plot the space - time in a @xmath72-plane",
    ", we can introduce a new time coordinate @xmath73 . from the metric ( [ ef ] ) or from fig . [ falling ]",
    "we see that the line @xmath61 , @xmath74constant , and @xmath75 constant is a null ray , and hence , the surface at @xmath61 is a null surface .",
    "this null surface is an event horizon because inside @xmath61 all cones have @xmath45 in their future ( see figure [ falling ] ) .",
    "everything that crosses the event horizon will end at the singularity .",
    "this is the inescapable fate for everything inside a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "there is no way to avoid it : in the future of every event inside the event horizon is the singularity .",
    "however , that no signal coming from the center of the black hole can reach a falling observer , since the singularity is always in the future , and a signal can arrive only from the past .",
    "a falling observer will never see the singularity .",
    "many coordinates systems can be used to describe black holes . for this reason , it is convenient to provide a definition of a black hole that is independent of the choice of coordinates .",
    "first , i will introduce some preliminary useful definitions ( e.g. hawking & ellis 1973 , wald 1984 ) . +",
    "* definition . * _ a causal curve in a space - time @xmath76 is a curve that is non space - like , that is , piecewise either time - like or null ( light - like ) . _",
    "+ we say that a given space - time @xmath77 is _ time - orientable _ if we can define over @xmath42 a smooth non - vanishing time - like vector field . +",
    "* definition . * _ if @xmath76 is a time - orientable space - time , then @xmath78 , the causal future of @xmath79 , denoted @xmath80 , is defined by : @xmath81 _    similarly , + * definition . * _ if @xmath76 is a time - orientable space - time , then @xmath78 , the causal past of @xmath79 , denoted @xmath82 , is defined by _ : @xmath83    the causal future and past of any set @xmath84 are given by : @xmath85    and , @xmath86    a set @xmath87 is said _ achronal _ if no two points of @xmath87 are time - like related .",
    "a cauchy surface is an achronal surface such that every non space - like curve in @xmath42 crosses it once , and only once , @xmath87 .",
    "a space - time @xmath88 is _ globally hyperbolic _ iff it admits a space - like hypersurface @xmath84 which is a cauchy surface for @xmath42 .",
    "causal relations are invariant under conformal transformations of the metric . in this way ,",
    "the space - times @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , with @xmath91 a non - zero @xmath92 function , have the same causal structure .",
    "let us now consider a space - time where all null geodesics that start in a region @xmath93 end at @xmath94 .",
    "then , such a space - time , @xmath76 , is said to contain a _ black hole _",
    "if @xmath42 _ is not _ contained in @xmath95 . in other words , there is a region from where no null geodesic can reach the _ asymptotic flat _ future space - time , or , equivalently , there is a region of @xmath42 that is causally disconnected from the global future . the _ black hole region _ , @xmath96 , of such space - time is @xmath97 $ ] , and the boundary of @xmath96 in @xmath42 , @xmath98 , is the _ event horizon _ .",
    "notice that a black hole is conceived as a space - time _ region _",
    ", i.e. what characterises the black hole is its metric and , consequently , its curvature .",
    "what is peculiar of this space - time region is that it is causally disconnected from the rest of the space - time : no events in this region can make any influence on events outside the region .",
    "hence the name of the boundary , event horizon : events inside the black hole are separated from events in the global external future of space - time . the events in the black hole , nonetheless , as all events , are causally determined by past events .",
    "a black hole does not represent a breakdown of classical causality .    a useful representation of a black hole is given by a carter - penrose diagram .",
    "this is a two - dimensional diagram that captures the causal relations between different points in space - time .",
    "it is an extension of a minkowski diagram where the vertical dimension represents time , and the horizontal dimension represents space , and slanted lines at an angle of @xmath99 correspond to light rays .",
    "the main difference with a minkowski diagram ( light cone ) is that , locally , the metric on a carter - penrose diagram is conformally equivalent are conformally equivalent if one is obtained from the other through multiplication by a function on @xmath42 . ] to the actual metric in space - time .",
    "the conformal factor is chosen such that the entire infinite space - time is transformed into a carter - penrose diagram of finite size . for spherically symmetric space - times",
    ", every point in the diagram corresponds to a 2-sphere . in figure [ c - p ] , i show a carter - penrose diagram of a schwarzschild space - time .        from the carter - penrose diagram ,",
    "it is clear that there is no time - like curve that starting from the interior region of the black hole can reach the conformally flat future infinity .",
    "all curves in this region can only end in the singularity .",
    "schwarzschild black holes are spherically symmetric , non - rotating objects .",
    "all known astrophysical systems have some angular momentum . in particular , since black holes of stellar mass are expected to result from the collapse of massive stars , they should be rapidly rotating objects due to the momentum conservation .",
    "the metric of a rotating mass in vacuum is the kerr metric . for a rotating body of mass @xmath42 and angular momentum per unit mass @xmath100",
    ", this metric can be written as : @xmath101\\sigma^{-1}\\sin^2\\theta\\\\\\sigma&\\equiv & r^2+a^2 c^{-2}\\cos^2\\theta\\\\\\delta&\\equiv & r^2 - 2gmc^{-2}r+a^2c^{-2}. \\label{kerr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath43 .",
    "the metric reduces to the schwarzschild metric for @xmath102 . in boyer - lindquist coordinates the metric is approximately lorentzian at infinity .",
    "the element @xmath103 no longer vanishes . even at infinity",
    "this element remains ( hence i wrote _ approximately _ lorentzian above ) .",
    "the kerr parameter @xmath104 has dimensions of length",
    ". the larger the ratio of this scale to @xmath105 ( the _ spin  parameter _",
    "@xmath106 ) , the more aspherical the metric .",
    "schwarzschild s black hole is the special case of kerr s for @xmath102 .",
    "notice that , with the adopted conventions , the angular momentum @xmath107 is related to the parameter @xmath100 by : @xmath108    just as the schwarzschild solution is the unique static vacuum solution of eqs .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) ( a result called israel s theorem ) , the kerr metric is the unique stationary axisymmetric vacuum solution ( carter - robinson theorem ) .",
    "the horizon , the surface which can not be crossed outwards , is determined by the condition @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "it lies at @xmath111 where @xmath112^{1/2}.\\label{rh}\\ ] ] indeed , the track @xmath111 , @xmath74 constant with @xmath113 has @xmath114 ( it represents a photon circling azimuthally _ on _ the horizon , as opposed to hovering at it ) .",

    "if a particle initially falls radially with no angular momentum from infinity to the black hole , it gains angular motion during the infall .",
    "the angular velocity as seen from a distant observer is : @xmath123    a particle falling into the black hole from infinite will acquire angular velocity in the direction of the spin of the black hole . as the black hole is approached , the particle will find an increasing tendency to get carried away in the same sense in which the black hole is rotating . to keep the particle stationary with respect to the distant stars , it will be necessary to apply a force against this tendency .",
    "the closer the particle will be to the black hole , the stronger the force . at a point",
    "@xmath124 it becomes impossible to counteract the rotational sweeping force .",
    "the particle is in a kind of space - time maelstrom .",
    "the surface determined by @xmath124 is the _",
    "static limit _ : from there in , you can not avoid to rotate .",
    "space - time is rotating here in such a way that you can not do anything in order to not co - rotate with it .",
    "you can still escape from the black hole , since the outer event horizon has not been crossed , but rotation is inescapable .",
    "the region between the static limit and the event horizon is called the _",

    "the condition is satisfied at the surface . solving @xmath126 we obtain the shape of the ergosphere : @xmath131    the static limit lies outside the horizon except at the poles where both surfaces coincide .",

    "an essential singularity occurs when @xmath133 .",
    "this happens if @xmath134 .",
    "this condition implies : @xmath135 such a condition is fulfilled only by @xmath45 and @xmath136 .",
    "this translates in cartesian coordinates to , @xmath137 , @xmath138 : @xmath139 the singularity is a ring of radius @xmath140 on the equatorial plane .",
    "if @xmath102 , then schwarzschild s point - like singularity is recovered . if @xmath141 the singularity is not necessarily in the future of all events at @xmath142 : the singularity can be avoided by some geodesics .",
    "a sketch of a kerr black hole is shown in figure [ kbh ] .",
    "non - vacuum solutions of both spherically symmetric and rotating black holes exists , but since they are thought to be of no astrophysical importance , i do not discuss them here ( the interested reader can see romero & vila 2014 and punsly 2001 ) .",
    "determinism is a metaphysical doctrine about the nature of the world .",
    "it is an ontological assumption : the assumption that all events are given .",
    "it can be traced to parmenides and his `` what is , is '' ( romero 2012 ) .",
    "it is important to emphasise that determinism does not require causality and does not imply predictability .",

    ". the existence of solutions to some equations that represent physical laws does not imply physical existence .",
    "physical existence is independent of our conceptions .",

    "general relativity is an example of a physical theory that can be ontologically deterministic but nonetheless epistemologically underdetermined .",
    "i remark that the existence of singular space - time models @xmath143 does not imply a breakdown of the ontological determinacy of the theory .",

    "the second law of thermodynamics states that _ the entropy of a closed system never decreases_. if entropy is denoted by @xmath87 , this law reads : @xmath144    in the 1870s , ludwig boltzmann argued that the effect of randomly moving gas molecules is to ensure that the entropy of a gas would increase , until it reaches its maximum possible value .",
    "this is his famous _",
    "h - theorem_. boltzmann was able to show that macroscopic distributions of great inhomogeneity ( i.e. of high order or low entropy ) are formed from relatively few microstate arrangements of molecules , and were , consequently , relatively improbable .",
    "since physical systems do not tend to go into states that are less probable than the states they are in , it follows that any system would evolve toward the macrostate that is consistent with the larger number of microstates .",
    "the number of microstates and the entropy of the system are related by the fundamental formula : @xmath145 where @xmath146 jk@xmath147 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath148 is the volume of the phase - space that corresponds to the macrostate of entropy @xmath87 .",
    "more than twenty years after the publication of boltzmann s fundamental papers on kinetic theory , it was pointed out by burbury ( 1894 , 1895 ) that the source of asymmetry in the h - theorem is the implicit assumption that the motions of the gas molecules are independent before they collide and not afterwards .",
    "this essentially means that the entropy increase is a consequence of the _ initial conditions _ imposed upon the state of the system .",
    "boltzmann s response was :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there must then be in the universe , which is in thermal equilibrium as a whole and therefore dead , here and there , relatively small regions of the size of our world , which during the relatively short time of eons deviate significantly from thermal equilibrium . among these worlds",

    "this is because _ all formal representations of all fundamental laws of physics are invariant under the operation of time reversal_. nonetheless , the evolution of all physical processes in the universe is irreversible .",
    "if we accept , as mentioned , that the origin of the irreversibility is not in the laws but in the initial conditions of the laws , two additional problems emerge : 1 ) what were exactly these initial conditions ? , and 2 ) how the initial conditions , of global nature , can enforce , at any time and any place , the observed local irreversibility ?    the first problem is , in turn , related to the following one , once the cosmological setting is taken into account : in the past , the universe was hotter and at some point matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium ; how is this compatible with the fact that entropy has ever been increasing according to the so - called past hypothesis , i.e. entropy was at a minimum at some past time and has been increasing ever since ?",
    "the standard answer to this question invokes the expansion of the universe : as the universe expanded , the maximum possible entropy increased with the size of the universe , but the actual entropy was left well behind the permitted maximum .",
    "the source of irreversibility in the second law of thermodynamics is the trend of the entropy to reach the permitted maximum . according to this view",
    ", the universe actually began in a state of maximum entropy , but due to the expansion , it was still possible for the entropy to continue growing .",
    "the main problem with this line of thought is that is not true that the universe was in a state of maximum disorder at some early time .",
    "in fact , although locally matter and radiation might have been in thermal equilibrium , this situation occurred in a regime were the global effects of gravity can not be ignored ( penrose 1979 ) . since gravity is an attractive force , and the universe was extremely smooth ( i.e structureless ) in early times , as indicated , for instance , by the measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation",

    "if we denote by @xmath155 a scalar formed out by contractions of the weyl tensor , the initial condition @xmath156 is required if entropy is still growing today .",
    "the answer to the second question posed above , namely , ` how the second law is locally enforced by the initial conditions , which are of global nature ? ' , seems to require a coupling between gravitation ( of global nature ) and electrodynamics ( of local action ) . in what follows",
    "i suggest that black holes can provide the key for this coupling ( for the role of cosmological horizons in this problem see romero & prez 2011 ) .",

    "null surface_. for @xmath198 , the sign of the derivative is inverted .",
    "the inward region of @xmath197 is time - like for any physical system that has crossed the boundary surface .",
    "as we approach to the horizon from the flat space - time region , the light cones become thinner and thinner indicating the restriction to the possible trajectories imposed by the increasing curvature . on the inner side of the horizon the local direction of time",
    "is ` inverted ' in the sense that all null or time - like trajectories have in their future the singularity at the center of the black hole .",
    "there is a very interesting consequence of all this : an observer on the horizon will have her present _ along _ the horizon .",
    "all events occurring on the horizon are simultaneous .",
    "the temporal distance from the observer at any point on the horizon to any event occurring on the horizon is zero ( the observer is on a null surface @xmath114 so the proper time interval is necessarily zero ) . if the black hole has existed during the whole history of the universe , all events on the horizon during such history ( for example the emission of photons on the horizon by infalling matter ) are _ present _ to any observer crossing the horizon .",
    "these events are certainly not all present to an observer outside the black hole .",
    "if the outer observer is a presentist , she surely will think that some of these events do not exist because they occurred or will occur either in the remote past or the remote future .",
    "but if we accept that what there is can not depend on the reference frame adopted for the description of the events , it seems we have an argument against presentism here . before going further into the ontological implications ,",
    "let me clarify a few physical points .",
    "i remark that the horizon 1 ) does not depend on the choice of the coordinate system adopted to describe the black hole , 2 ) the horizon is an absolute null surface , in the sense that this property is intrinsic and not frame - dependent , and 3 ) it is a non - singular surface ( or ` well - behaved ' , i.e. space - time is regular on the horizon ) .    in a world",
    "described by special relativity , the only way to cross a null surface is by moving faster than the speed of light . as we have seen",
    ", this is not the case in a universe with black holes .",
    "we can then argue against presentism along the following lines .",
    "+ argument @xmath199 :    * @xmath200 : there are black holes in the universe .",
    "* @xmath201 : black holes are correctly described by general relativity . * @xmath202 : black holes have closed null surfaces ( horizons ) . * therefore , there are closed null surfaces in the universe .",
    "argument @xmath203 :    * @xmath204 : all events on a closed null surface are simultaneous with any event on the same surface .",
    "* @xmath205 : all events on the closed null surface are simultaneous with the birth of the black hole .",
    "* @xmath206 : some distant events are simultaneous with the birth of the black hole , but not with other events related to the black hole . *",
    "therefore , there are events that are simultaneous in one reference frame , and not in another .",
    "simultaneity is frame - dependent . since what there exist",
    "can not depend on the reference frame we use to describe it , we conclude that there are non - simultaneous events .",
    "therefore , presentism is false .",
    "let us see which assumptions are open to criticism by the presentist .",
    "an irreducible presentist might plainly reject @xmath200 .",
    "although there is significant astronomical evidence supporting the existence of black holes ( e.g. camenzind 2007 , paredes 2009 , romero and vila 2014 ) , the very elusive nature of these objects still leaves room for some speculations like gravastars and other exotic compact objects .",
    "the price of rejecting @xmath200 , however , is very high : black holes are now a basic component of most mechanisms that explain extreme events in astrophysics , from quasars to the so - called gamma - ray bursts , from the formation of galaxies to the production of jets in binary systems .",
    "the presentist rejecting black holes should reformulate the bulk of contemporary high - energy astrophysics in terms of new mechanisms . in any case",
    ", @xmath200 is susceptible of empirical validation through direct imagining of the super - massive black hole `` shadow '' in the center of our galaxy by sub - mm interferometric techniques in the next decade ( e.g. falcke et al . 2011 ) . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the cumulative case for the existence of black holes is overwhelming , and very few scientists would reject them on the basis of metaphysical considerations only .",
    "the presentist might , instead , reject @xmath201 .",
    "after all , we _ know _ that general relativity fails at the planck scale .",
    "why should it provide a correct description of black holes ?",
    "the reason is that the horizon of a black hole is quite far from the region where the theory fails ( the singularity ) .",
    "the distance , in the case of a schwarzschild black hole , is @xmath47 . for a black hole of 10 solar masses , as the one suspected to form part of the binary system cygnus x-1 , this means @xmath207 km . and for the black hole in the center of the galaxy , about 12 million km .",
    "any theory of gravitation must yield the same results as general relativity at such distances .",
    "so , even if general relativity is not the right theory for the classical gravitational field , the correct theory should predict the formation of black holes under the same conditions .",
    "there is not much to do with @xmath204 , since it follows from the condition that defines the null surface : @xmath114 , where @xmath208 is the proper temporal separation . ] ; similarly @xmath205 only specifies one of the events on the null surface . a presentist might refuse to identify ` the present ' with a null surface .",
    "after all , in minkowskian space - time or even in a globally time - orientable pseudo - riemannian space - time the present is usually taken as the hyperplane perpendicular to the local time .",
    "but in space - times with black holes , the horizon is not only a null surface ; it is also a surface locally normal to the time direction . in a minkowskian space - time the plane of the present is not coincident with a null surface .",
    "however , close to the event horizon of a black hole , things change , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ cones - schw ] ) . as we approach the horizon , the null surface matches the plane of the present . on the horizon ,",
    "both surfaces are exactly coincident .",
    "a presentist rejecting the identification of the present with a _ closed _ null surface on an event horizon should abandon what is perhaps her most cherished belief : the identification of ` the present ' with hypersurfaces that are normal to a local time - like direction .",
    "the result mentioned above is not a consequence of any particular choice of coordinates but an intrinsic property of a black hole horizon .",
    "this statement can be easily proved .",
    "the symmetries of schwarzschild space - time imply the existence of a preferred radial function , @xmath209 , which serves as an affine parameter along both null directions .",
    "the gradient of this function , @xmath210 satisfies ( @xmath211 ) :    @xmath212    thus , @xmath213 is space - like for @xmath214 , null for @xmath215 , and time - like for @xmath216 . the 3-surface given by @xmath215 is the horizon @xmath178 of the black hole in schwarzschild space - time . from eq .",
    "( [ ra ] ) it follows that @xmath217 over @xmath178 , and hence @xmath178 is a null surface[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "premise @xmath206 , perhaps , looks more promising for a last line of presentist defence .",
    "it might be argued that events on the horizon are not simultaneous with any event in the external universe .",
    "they are , in a very precise sense , cut off from the universe , and hence can not be simultaneous with any distant event .",
    "let us work out a counterexample .",
    "the so - called long gamma - ray bursts are thought to be the result of the implosion of a very massive and rapidly rotating star .",
    "the core of the star becomes a black hole , which accretes material from the remaining stellar crust .",
    "this produces a growth of the black hole mass and the ejection of matter from the magnetised central region in the form of relativistic jets ( e.g. woosely 1993 ) .",
    "approximately , one of these events occur in the universe per day .",
    "they are detected by satellites like _ swift _",
    "( e.g. piran and fan 2007 ) , with durations of a few tens of seconds .",
    "this is the time that takes for the black hole to swallow the collapsing star .",
    "let us consider a gamma - ray burst of , say , 10 seconds . before these 10 seconds , the black hole did not exist for a distant observer @xmath218 . afterwards",
    ", there is a black hole in the universe that will last more than the life span of any human observer .",
    "let us now consider an observer @xmath219 collapsing with the star . at some instant she will cross the null surface of the horizon . this will occur within the 10 seconds that the collapse lasts for @xmath218 .",
    "but for @xmath219 all photons that cross the horizon are simultaneous , including those that left @xmath218 long after the 10 seconds of the event and crossed the horizon after traveling a long way . for instance",
    ", photons leaving the planet of @xmath218 one million years after the gamma - ray burst , might cross the horizon , and then can interact with @xmath219 .",
    "so , the formation of the black hole is simultaneous with events in @xmath218 and @xmath219 , but these very same events of @xmath219 are simultaneous with events that are in the distant future of @xmath218 .",
    "the reader used to work with schwarzschild coordinates perhaps will object that @xmath219 never reaches the horizon , since the approaching process takes an infinite time in a distant reference frame .",
    "this is , however , an effect of the choice of the coordinate system and the test - particle approximation ( see , for instance , hoyng 2006 , p.116 ) . if the process is represented in eddington - finkelstein coordinates , it takes a finite time for the whole star to disappear , as shown by the fact that the gamma - ray burst are quite short events .",
    "accretion / ejection processes , well - documented in active galactic nuclei and microquasars ( e.g. mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) also show that the time taken to reach the horizon is finite in the asymptotically flat region of space - time .",
    "my conclusion is that black holes can be used to show that presentism provides a defective picture of the ontological substratum of the world .",
    "black holes are often invoked in philosophical ( and even physical ) discussions about production and destruction of ` information ' .",
    "this mostly occurs in relation to the possibility hypercomputing and the application of quantum field theory to the near horizon region .",
    "i shall review both topics here .",
    "the expression ` hypercomputing ' refers to the actual performance of an infinite number of operations in a finite time with the aim of calculating beyond the turing barrier ( turing , 1936 . for a definition of a turing machine see hopcrof & ullman 1979 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that such a hypercomputation can be performed in a kerr space - time ( nmeti & david 2006 , nmeti & handrka 2006 ) .",

    "this is because there always exists a curve @xmath225 with future endpoint @xmath79 which has finite proper time .",
    "we can think of @xmath224 as the `` sender '' and @xmath226 as the `` receiver '' of a signal . in this way , the receiver may obtain knowledge of the result of an infinite number of tasks in a finite time . in a kerr space - time",
    "this scheme can be arranged as follows .",
    "the `` sender '' is a spacecraft orbiting the kerr black hole with a computer onboard .",

    "as the capsule approaches the inner horizon it intersects more and more signals from the orbiter , which emits periodically results of the computer calculations into the black hole . by the time the capsule crosses the inner horizon it has received all signals emitted by the computer in an infinite time ( assuming that both the black hole and the orbiter can exist forever )",

    "the lines that connect both trajectories represent signals sent from @xmath224 to @xmath227.,width=264 ]    there are many reasons to think that the described situation is physically impossible .",
    "i shall mention the following ones : 1 ) the required inner black hole structure does not correspond to an astrophysical black hole generated by gravitational collapse . in a real black hole the cauchy horizon is expected to collapse into a ( probably null ) singularity due to the backscattered gravitational wave tails that enter the black hole and are blueshifted at the cauchy horizon ( see next section and brady 1999 ) .",
    "the instability of the cauchy horizon seems to be a quite general feature of any realistic black hole interior model .",
    "2 ) the black hole is not expected to exist during an infinite duration : it should evaporate through hawking radiation , over very long ( but always finite ) time .",
    "3 ) the performance of infinite operations would require an infinite amount of energy ( bunge 1977 , romero 2014 ) .",
    "even if the universe were infinite , a finite spacecraft can not manipulate infinite amounts of energy .",
    "4 ) if signals are periodically sent to the receiver , the blushifted electromagnetic radiation would burn the capsule by the time it crosses the cauchy horizon .",
    "nmeti & david ( 2006 ) argue that this might be circumvented by sending just one signal with the final result .",
    "this suggestion faces the problems of the actual infinite : for any moment there will always be a further moment , then , when the spaceship would send this signal ?",
    "5 ) the universe seems to be entering into a de sitter phase , so particle horizons will appear and block part of the accessible space - time to the spacecraft limiting its resources .",
    "i think that the cumulative argument is strong enough to support a _ hypercomputing avoidance conjeture _ : the laws of physics are such that no actual hypercomputation can be performed .",
    "i turn now to another issue related to black holes and information : the destruction of information by black holes .",
    "this seems to be a topic of high concern for quantum field theorists , to the point that the presumed destruction of information in a black hole is called the `` black hole information paradox '' .",
    "i maintain that such a paradox does not exist : black holes can not destroy any information .",
    "the reason is that information is not a property of physical systems .",

    "the analogy between area and entropy allows to state a set of laws for black holes thermodynamics ( bardeen et al .",
    "1973 ) :    * first law ( energy conservation ) : @xmath234 . here",

    "* zeroth law ( thermal equilibrium ) : the surface gravity ( temperature ) is constant over the event horizon of a stationary axially symmetric black hole .    if a temperature can be associated with black holes , then they should radiate as any other body .",
    "the luminosity of a schwarzschild black hole is : @xmath241 here , @xmath242 is the stephan - boltzmann constant .",
    "this expression can be written as : @xmath243 the lifetime of a black hole is : @xmath244 notice that the black hole heats up as it radiates !",
    "this occurs because when the hole radiates , its mass decreases and then according to eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) the temperature must rise .",
    "the black hole then will lose energy and its area will decrease slowly , violating the second law of thermodynamics",
    ". however , there is no violation if we consider a _ generalised second law _ , that always holds : _ in any process , the total generalised entropy @xmath245 never decreases _ ( bekenstein 1973 ) .",
    "unfortunately , many physicists think that entropy and information are the same thing .",
    "this confusion seems to come from j. von neumann , who advised , not without some sarcasm , claude shannon to adopt the expression ` entropy ' to name the information characterised in the mathematical theory of communications developed by shannon and weaver ( 1949 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ you should call it entropy , for two reasons . in the first place",

    "if massive particles decay into photons on such long timescales , the final state of the universe will be that of a dilute photon gas .",
    "cosmic time will cease to make any sense for such a state of the universe , since whatever exist will be on a null surface . without time , there will be nothing else to happen .",
    "penrose ( 2010 ) , however , has suggested that a countable sequence of open flrw space - times , each representing a big bang followed by an infinite future expansion might occur , since the past conformal boundary of one copy of flrw space - time can be `` attached '' to the future conformal boundary of another , after an appropriate conformal rescaling .",
    "since bosons obey the laws of conformally invariant quantum theory , they will behave in the same way in the rescaled sections of the cyclical universe . for bosons ,",
    "the boundary between different cycles is not a boundary at all , but just a space - like surface that can be passed across like any other .",
    "fermions , on the other hand , remain confined to each cycle , where they are generated and decay .",
    "most of the fermions might be converted into radiation in black holes .",
    "if this is correct , black holes would then be the key to the regeneration of the universe .",
    "in this chapter i have overviewed some philosophical problems related to black holes .",
    "the interface between black hole physics and philosophy remains mostly unexplored , and the list of topics i have selected is by no means exhaustive .",
    "the study of black holes can be a very powerful tool to shed light on many other philosophical issues in the philosophy of science and even in general relativity .",
    "evolving black holes , black hole dependence of the asymptotic behaviour of space - time , the nature of inertia , the energy of the gravitational field , quantum effects in the near horizon region , turbulent space - time during black hole mergers , the classical characterisation of the gravitational field , and regular black hole interiors are all physical topics that have philosophical significance . in black holes our current representations of space , time , and gravity are pushed to their very limits .",
    "the exploration of such limits can pave the way to new discoveries about the world and our ways of representing it .",
