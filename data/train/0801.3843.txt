    "recent work in higher gauge theory has revealed the importance of categorifying the theory of bundles and considering ` 2-bundles ' , where the fiber is a topological category instead of a topological space @xcite .",
    "these structures show up not only in mathematics , where they form a useful generalization of nonabelian gerbes @xcite , but also in physics , where they can be used to describe parallel transport of strings @xcite .    the concepts of ` ech cohomology ' and ` classifying space ' play a well - known and fundamental role in the theory of bundles . for any topological group @xmath0 , principal @xmath0-bundles over a space @xmath1 are classified by the first ech cohomology of @xmath1 with coefficients in @xmath0 . furthermore ,",
    "under some mild conditions , these ech cohomology classes are in 1 - 1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps from @xmath1 to the classifying space @xmath4 .",
    "this lets us define characteristic classes for bundles , coming from cohomology classes for @xmath4 .",
    "all these concepts and results can be generalized from bundles to 2-bundles .",
    "bartels @xcite has defined principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles where @xmath6 is a ` topological 2-group ' : roughly speaking , a categorified version of a topological group . furthermore , his work shows how principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles over @xmath1 are classified by @xmath5 , the first ech cohomology of @xmath1 with coefficients in @xmath6 .",
    "this form of cohomology , also known as ` nonabelian cohomology ' , is familiar from work on nonabelian gerbes @xcite .",
    "in fact , under mild conditions on @xmath6 and @xmath1 , there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between @xmath5 and the set of homotopy classes of maps from @xmath1 to a certain space @xmath8 : the classifying space of the geometric realization of the nerve of @xmath6 .",
    "so , @xmath8 serves as a classifying space for the topological 2-group @xmath6 !",
    "this paper seeks to provide an introduction to topological 2-groups and nonabelian cohomology leading up to a self - contained proof of this fact .    in his pioneering work on this subject",
    ", juro @xcite asserted that a certain space homotopy equivalent to ours is a classifying space for the first ech cohomology with coefficients in @xmath6 .",
    "however , there are some gaps in his argument for this assertion ( see section [ remarks ] for details ) .",
    "later , baas , bkstedt and kro @xcite gave the definitive treatment of classifying spaces for 2-bundles .",
    "for any ` good ' topological 2-category @xmath13 , they construct a classifying space @xmath14 .",
    "they then show that for any space @xmath1 with the homotopy type of a cw complex , concordance classes of ` charted @xmath13 - 2-bundles ' correspond to homotopy classes of maps from @xmath1 to @xmath14 . in particular ,",
    "a topological 2-group is just a topological 2-category with one object and with all morphisms and 2-morphisms invertible  and in this special case , their result _ almost _ reduces to the fact mentioned above .",
    "there are some subtleties , however .",
    "most importantly , while their ` charted @xmath13 - 2-bundles ' reduce precisely to our principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles , they classify these 2-bundles up to concordance , while we classify them up to a superficially different equivalence relation .",
    "two @xmath6 - 2-bundles over a space @xmath15 are ` concordant ' if they are restrictions of some @xmath6 - 2-bundle over @xmath16 $ ] to the two ends @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this makes it easy to see that homotopic maps from @xmath15 to the classifying space define concordant @xmath6 - 2-bundles .",
    "we instead consider two @xmath6 - 2-bundles to be equivalent if their defining ech 1-cocycles are cohomologous . in this approach",
    ", some work is required to show that homotopic maps from @xmath15 to the classifying space define equivalent @xmath6 - 2-bundles . _ a priori _ , it is not obvious that two @xmath6 - 2-bundles are equivalent in this ech sense if and only if they are concordant . however , since the classifying space of baas , bkstedt and kro is homotopy equivalent to the one we use , it follows from our work that these equivalence relations are the same  at least given @xmath6 and @xmath1 satisfying the technical conditions of both their result and ours .",
    "we also discuss an interesting example : the ` string 2-group ' @xmath9 of a simply - connected compact simple lie group @xmath0 @xcite . as its name suggests",
    ", this 2-group is of special interest in physics .",
    "mathematically , a key fact is that @xmath19  the geometric realization of the nerve of @xmath9  is the 3-connected cover of @xmath0 . using this",
    ", one can compute the rational cohomology of @xmath20 .",
    "this is nice , because these cohomology classes give ` characteristic classes ' for principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles , and when @xmath1 is a manifold one can hope to compute these in terms of a connection and its curvature , much as one does for ordinary principal bundles with a lie group as structure group .    section [ summary ] is an overview , starting with a review of the classic results that people are now categorifying .",
    "section [ 2groups ] reviews four viewpoints on topological 2-groups .",
    "section [ nonabelian ] explains nonabelian cohomology with coefficients in a topological 2-group .",
    "finally , in section [ proofs ] we prove the results stated in section [ summary ] , and comment a bit further on the work of juro and baas  bkstedt  kro .",
    "once one knows about ` topological 2-groups ' , it is irresistibly tempting to generalize all ones favorite results about topological groups to these new entities .",
    "so , let us begin with a quick review of some classic results about topological groups and their classifying spaces .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a topological group .",
    "the ech cohomology @xmath2 of a topological space @xmath1 with coefficients in @xmath0 is a set carefully designed to be in 1 - 1 correspondence with the set of isomorphism classes of principal @xmath0-bundles on @xmath1 .",
    "let us recall how this works .",
    "first suppose @xmath21 is an open cover of @xmath1 and @xmath22 is a principal @xmath0-bundle over @xmath1 that is trivial when restricted to each open set @xmath23 .",
    "then by comparing local trivialisations of @xmath22 over @xmath23 and @xmath24 we can define maps @xmath25 : the transition functions of the bundle . on triple intersections @xmath26 , these maps",
    "satisfy a cocycle condition : @xmath27 a collection of maps @xmath25 satisfying this condition is called a ` ech 1-cocycle ' subordinate to the cover @xmath28 .",
    "any such 1-cocycle defines a principal @xmath0-bundle over @xmath1 that is trivial over each set @xmath23 .",
    "next , suppose we have two principal @xmath0-bundles over @xmath1 that are trivial over each set @xmath23 , described by ech 1-cocycles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "these bundles are isomorphic if and only if for some maps @xmath31 we have @xmath32 on every double intersection @xmath33 . in this case",
    "we say the ech 1-cocycles are ` cohomologous ' .",
    "we define @xmath34 to be the quotient of the set of ech 1-cocycles subordinate to @xmath28 by this equivalence relation .",
    "recall that a ` good ' cover of @xmath1 is an open cover @xmath28 for which all the non - empty finite intersections of open sets @xmath23 in @xmath28 are contractible .",
    "we say a space @xmath1 * admits good covers * if any cover of @xmath1 has a good cover that refines it .",
    "for example , any ( paracompact hausdorff ) smooth manifold admits good covers , as does any simplicial complex .",
    "if @xmath1 admits good covers , @xmath34 is independent of the choice of good cover @xmath28 .",
    "so , we can denote it simply by @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , this set @xmath2 is in 1 - 1 correspondence with the set of isomorphism classes of principal @xmath0-bundles over @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that we can always trivialize any principal @xmath0-bundle over the open sets in a good cover .    for more general spaces ,",
    "we need to define the ech cohomology more carefully .",
    "if @xmath1 is a paracompact hausdorff space , we can define it to be the limit @xmath35 over all open covers , partially ordered by refinement .",
    "it is a classic result in topology that @xmath2 can be understood using homotopy theory with the help of milnor s construction @xcite of the classifying space @xmath4 :    [ milnor_theorem ] let @xmath0 be a topological group .",
    "then there is a topological space @xmath4 with the property that for any paracompact hausdorff space @xmath1 , there is a bijection @xmath36\\ ] ]    here @xmath37 $ ] denotes the set of homotopy classes of maps from @xmath15 into @xmath38 .",
    "the topological space @xmath4 is called the * classifying space * of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a canonical principal @xmath0-bundle on @xmath4 , called the universal @xmath0-bundle , and the theorem above is usually understood as the assertion that every principal @xmath0-bundle @xmath22 on @xmath1 is obtained by pullback from the universal @xmath0-bundle under a certain map @xmath39 ( the classifying map of @xmath22 ) .",
    "now let us discuss how to generalize all these results to topological 2-groups .",
    "first of all , what is a ` 2-group ' ? it is like a group , but ` categorified ' . while a group is a _ set _ equipped with _",
    "functions _ describing multiplication and inverses , and an identity _ element _ , a 2-group is a _ category _ equipped with _ functors _ describing multiplication and inverses , and an identity _",
    "object_. indeed , 2-groups are also known as ` categorical groups ' .",
    "a down - to - earth way to work with 2-groups involves treating them as ` crossed modules ' .",
    "a crossed module consists of a pair of groups @xmath40 and @xmath0 , together with a homomorphism @xmath41 and an action @xmath42 of @xmath0 on @xmath40 satisfying two conditions , equations and below .",
    "crossed modules were introduced by j.  h.  c.  whitehead @xcite without the aid of category theory .",
    "mac lane and whitehead @xcite later proved that just as the fundamental group captures all the homotopy - invariant information about a connected pointed homotopy 1-type , a crossed module captures all the homotopy - invariant information about a connected pointed homotopy 2-type . by the 1960s",
    "it was clear to verdier and others that crossed modules are essentially the same as categorical groups .",
    "the first published proof of this may be due to brown and spencer @xcite .    just as one can define principal @xmath0-bundles over a space @xmath1 for any topological group @xmath0 , one can define ` principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles ' over @xmath1 for any topological 2-group @xmath6 .",
    "just as a principal @xmath0-bundle has a copy of @xmath0 as fiber , a principal @xmath6 - 2-bundle has a copy of @xmath6 as fiber .",
    "readers interested in more details are urged to read bartels thesis , available online @xcite .",
    "we shall have nothing else to say about principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles except that they are classified by a categorified version of ech cohomology , denoted @xmath5 .    as before",
    ", we can describe this categorified ech cohomology as a set of cocycles modulo an equivalence relation .",
    "let @xmath28 be a cover of @xmath1 .",
    "if we think of the @xmath43-group @xmath6 in terms of its associated crossed module @xmath44 , then a cocycle subordinate to @xmath28 consists ( in part ) of maps @xmath45 as before .",
    "however , we now ` weaken ' the cocycle condition and only require that @xmath46 for some maps @xmath47 .",
    "these maps are in turn required to satisfy a cocycle condition of their own on quadruple intersections , namely @xmath48 where @xmath42 is the action of @xmath0 on @xmath40 .",
    "this mildly intimidating equation will be easier to understand when we draw it as a commuting tetrahedron  see equation in section  [ nonabelian ] .",
    "the pair @xmath49 is called a @xmath6-valued * ech 1-cocycle * subordinate to @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , we say two cocycles @xmath49 and @xmath50 are * cohomologous * if @xmath51 for some maps @xmath31 and @xmath52 , which must make a certain prism commute  see equation .",
    "we define @xmath53 to be the set of cohomology classes of @xmath6-valued ech 1-cocycles . to capture the entire cohomology set @xmath5 , we must next take a limit of the sets @xmath53 as @xmath28 ranges over all covers of @xmath1 . for more details",
    "we refer to section  [ nonabelian ] .",
    "theorem [ milnor_theorem ] generalizes nicely from topological groups to topological 2-groups .",
    "but , following the usual tradition in algebraic topology , we shall henceforth work in the category of @xmath54-spaces , i.e. , compactly generated weak hausdorff spaces .",
    "so , by ` topological space ' we shall always mean a @xmath54-space , and by ` topological group ' we shall mean a group object in the category of @xmath54-spaces .    [ classifying ]",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is a well - pointed topological 2-group and @xmath1 is a paracompact hausdorff space admitting good covers .",
    "then there is a bijection @xmath55\\ ] ] where the topological group @xmath56 is the geometric realization of the nerve of @xmath6 .",
    "one term here requires explanation .",
    "a topological group @xmath0 is said to be ` well pointed ' if @xmath57 is an ndr pair , or in other words if the inclusion @xmath58 is a closed cofibration .",
    "we say that a topological 2-group @xmath6 is * well pointed * if the topological groups @xmath0 and @xmath40 in its corresponding crossed module are well pointed . for example , any ` lie 2-group ' is well pointed : a topological 2-group is called a * lie 2-group * if @xmath0 and @xmath40 are lie groups and the maps @xmath59 are smooth . more generally , any ` frchet lie 2-group ' @xcite is well pointed .",
    "we explain the importance of this notion in section [ proof.thm.1 ] .",
    "bartels @xcite has already considered two examples of principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles , corresponding to abelian gerbes and nonabelian gerbes .",
    "let us discuss the classification of these before turning to a third , more novel example .    for an abelian gerbe @xcite , we first choose an abelian topological group @xmath40  in practice , usually just @xmath60 .",
    "then , we form the crossed module with @xmath61 and this choice of @xmath40 , with @xmath62 and @xmath42 trivial .",
    "the corresponding topological 2-group deserves to be called @xmath63 $ ] , since it is a ` shifted version ' of @xmath40 .",
    "bartels shows that the classification of abelian @xmath40-gerbes matches the classification of @xmath63$]-2-bundles .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath64| \\cong bh\\ ] ] so the classifying space for abelian @xmath40-gerbes is @xmath65| \\cong b(bh)\\ ] ] in the case @xmath66 , this classifying space is just @xmath67 .",
    "so , in this case , we recover the well - known fact that abelian @xmath60-gerbes over @xmath1 are classified by @xmath68 \\cong h^3(m,{\\mathbb{z}})\\ ] ] just as principal @xmath60 bundles are classified by @xmath69 .    for a nonabelian gerbe @xcite , we fix any topological group @xmath40 .",
    "then we form the crossed module with @xmath70 and this choice of @xmath40 , where @xmath71 sends each element of @xmath40 to the corresponding inner automorphism , and the action of @xmath0 on @xmath40 is the tautologous one .",
    "this gives a topological 2-group called @xmath72 .",
    "bartels shows that the classification of nonabelian @xmath40-gerbes matches the classification of @xmath72 - 2-bundles .",
    "it follows that , under suitable conditions on @xmath40 , nonabelian @xmath40-gerbes are classified by homotopy classes of maps into @xmath73 .",
    "a third application of theorem [ classifying ] arises when @xmath0 is a simply - connected compact simple lie group . for any such group",
    "there is an isomorphism @xmath74 and the generator @xmath75 transgresses to a characteristic class @xmath76 .",
    "associated to @xmath77 is a map @xmath78 and it can be shown that the homotopy fiber of this can be given the structure of a topological group @xmath79 .",
    "this group @xmath79 is the 3-connected cover of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath80 , this group @xmath79 is known as @xmath81 . in general , we might call @xmath79 the * string group * of @xmath0 . note that until one picks a specific construction for the homotopy fiber , @xmath79 is only defined up to homotopy  or more precisely , up to equivalence of @xmath82-spaces .    in @xcite , under the above hypotheses on @xmath0 , a topological 2-group subsequently dubbed the * string 2-group * of @xmath0 was introduced .",
    "let us denote this by @xmath9 .",
    "a key result about @xmath9 is that the topological group @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath79 . by construction @xmath9",
    "is a frchet lie 2-group , hence well pointed .",
    "so , from theorem [ classifying ] we immediately conclude :    [ equivalence ] suppose that @xmath0 is a simply - connected compact simple lie group .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a paracompact hausdorff space admitting good covers .",
    "then there are bijections between the following sets :    * the set of equivalence classes of principal @xmath9 - 2-bundles over @xmath1 , * the set of isomorphism classes of principal @xmath79-bundles over @xmath1 , * @xmath83 , * @xmath84 , * @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "one can describe the rational cohomology of @xmath86 in terms of the rational cohomology of @xmath4 , which is well - understood .",
    "the following result was pointed out to us by matt ando @xcite , and later discussed by greg ginot @xcite :    [ string ] suppose that @xmath0 is a simply - connected compact simple lie group , and let @xmath79 be the string group of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the transgression of the generator @xmath88 .",
    "then there is a ring isomorphism @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the ideal generated by @xmath11 .    as a result",
    ", we obtain characteristic classes for @xmath9 - 2-bundles :    [ characteristic ] suppose that @xmath0 is a simply - connected compact simple lie group and @xmath1 is a paracompact hausdorff space admitting good covers .",
    "then an equivalence class of principal @xmath9 - 2-bundles over @xmath1 determines a ring homomorphism @xmath91    to see this , we use corollary [ equivalence ] to reinterpret an equivalence class of principal @xmath6 - 2-bundles over @xmath1 as a homotopy class of maps @xmath92 . picking any representative @xmath93",
    ", we obtain a ring homomorphism @xmath94 this is independent of the choice of representative .",
    "then , we use theorem [ string ] .",
    "it is a nice problem to compute the rational characteristic classes of a principal @xmath9 - 2-bundle over a manifold using de rham cohomology .",
    "it should be possible to do this using the curvature of an arbitrary connection on the 2-bundle , just as for ordinary principal bundles with a lie group as structure group .",
    "sati , schreiber and stasheff @xcite have recently made excellent progress on solving this problem and its generalizations to @xmath95-bundles for higher @xmath95 .",
    "in this section we recall four useful perspectives on topological @xmath43-groups . for a more detailed account",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "recall that for us , a ` topological space ' really means a @xmath54-space , and a ` topological group ' really means a group object in the category of @xmath54-spaces .",
    "a * topological @xmath43-group * is a groupoid in the category of topological groups . in other words , it is a groupoid @xmath6 where the set @xmath96 of objects and the set @xmath97 of morphisms are each equipped with the structure of a topological group such that the source and target maps @xmath98 , the map @xmath99 assigning each object its identity morphism , the composition map @xmath100 , and the map sending each morphism to its inverse are all continuous group homomorphisms .",
    "equivalently , we can think of a topological 2-group as a group in the category of topological groupoids .",
    "a * topological groupoid * is a groupoid @xmath6 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are topological spaces ( or more precisely , @xmath54-spaces ) and all the groupoid operations just listed are continuous maps .",
    "we say that a functor @xmath101 between topological groupoids is * continuous * if the maps @xmath102 and @xmath103 are continous .",
    "a group in the category of topological groupoids is such a thing equipped with continuous functors @xmath104 , @xmath105 and a unit object @xmath106 satisfying the usual group axioms , written out as commutative diagrams .",
    "this second viewpoint is useful because any topological groupoid @xmath6 has a ` nerve ' @xmath107 , a simplicial space where the space of @xmath95-simplices consists of composable strings of morphisms @xmath108 taking the geometric realization of this nerve , we obtain a topological space which we denote as @xmath56 for short .",
    "if @xmath6 is a topological 2-group , its nerve inherits a group structure , so that @xmath107 is a topological simplicial group .",
    "this in turn makes @xmath56 into a topological group .",
    "a third way to understand topological 2-groups is to view them as topological crossed modules . recall that a * topological crossed module * @xmath109 consists of topological groups @xmath0 and @xmath40 together with a continuous homomorphism @xmath110 and a continuous action @xmath111 of @xmath0 as automorphisms of @xmath40 , satisfying the following two identities : @xmath112 the first equation above implies that the map @xmath41 is equivariant for the action of @xmath0 on @xmath40 defined by @xmath113 and the action of @xmath0 on itself by conjugation .",
    "the second equation is called the * peiffer identity*. when no confusion is likely to result , we will sometimes denote the 2-group corresponding to a crossed module @xmath109 simply by @xmath114 .",
    "every topological crossed module determines a topological @xmath43-group and vice versa . since there are some choices of convention involved in this construction , we briefly review it to fix our conventions .",
    "given a topological crossed module @xmath109 , we define a topological 2-group @xmath6 as follows .",
    "first , define the group @xmath96 of objects of @xmath6 and the group @xmath97 of morphisms of @xmath6 by @xmath115 where the semidirect product @xmath116 is formed using the left action of @xmath0 on @xmath40 via @xmath113 : @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the source and target of a morphism @xmath120 are defined by @xmath121 ( denoting both the target map @xmath122 and the homomorphism @xmath123 by the same letter should not cause any problems , since the first is the restriction of the second to @xmath124 . )",
    "the identity morphism of an object @xmath125 is defined by @xmath126 finally , the composite of the morphisms @xmath127 is defined to be @xmath128 it is easy to check that with these definitions , @xmath6 is a @xmath43-group .",
    "conversely , given a topological @xmath43-group @xmath6 , we define a crossed module @xmath109 by setting @xmath0 to be @xmath96 , @xmath40 to be @xmath129 , @xmath62 to be the restriction of the target homomorphism @xmath130 to the subgroup @xmath131 , and setting @xmath132    if @xmath0 is any topological group then there is a topological crossed module @xmath133 where @xmath62 and @xmath42 are trivial .",
    "the underlying groupoid of the corresponding topological 2-group has @xmath0 as its space of objects , and only identity morphisms .",
    "we sometimes call this 2-group the * discrete * topological 2-group associated to @xmath0  where ` discrete ' is used in the sense of category theory , not topology !    at the other extreme , if @xmath40 is a topological group then it follows from the peiffer identity that @xmath134 can be made into topological crossed module if and only if @xmath40 is abelian , and then in a unique way . this is because a groupoid with one object and @xmath40 as morphisms can be made into a 2-group precisely when @xmath40 is abelian .",
    "we already mentioned this 2-group in the previous section , where we called it @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "we will also need to talk about homomorphisms of @xmath43-groups .",
    "we shall understand these in the strictest possible sense .",
    "so , we say a * homomorphism * of topological @xmath43-groups is a functor such that @xmath135 and @xmath136 are both continuous homomorphisms of topological groups .",
    "we can also describe @xmath93 in terms of the crossed modules @xmath109 and @xmath137 associated to @xmath6 and @xmath138 respectively . in these terms the data of the functor @xmath93 is described by the commutative diagram @xmath139 ^ -{f } \\ar[d]_-t & h ' \\ar[d]^-{t ' } \\\\",
    "g \\ar[r]_-{f } & g ' } \\ ] ] where the upper @xmath93 denotes the restriction of @xmath140 to a map from @xmath40 to @xmath141 .",
    "( we are using @xmath93 to mean several different things , but this makes the notation less cluttered , and should not cause any confusion . )",
    "the maps @xmath142 and @xmath143 must both be continuous homomorphisms , and moreover must satisfy an equivariance property with respect to the actions of @xmath0 on @xmath40 and @xmath144 on @xmath141 : we have @xmath145 for all @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "finally , we will need to talk about short exact sequences of topological groups and @xmath43-groups . here",
    "the topology is important .",
    "if @xmath0 is a topological group and @xmath40 is a normal topological subgroup of @xmath0 , then we can define an action of @xmath40 on @xmath148 by right translation . in some circumstances ,",
    "the projection @xmath149 is a hurewicz fibration .",
    "for instance , this is the case if @xmath0 is a lie group and @xmath40 is a closed normal subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "we define a * short exact sequence * of topological groups to be a sequence @xmath150 of topological groups and continuous homomorphisms such that the underlying sequence of groups is exact and the map underlying the homomorphism @xmath151 is a hurewicz fibration .",
    "similarly , we define a * short exact sequence * of topological 2-groups to be a sequence @xmath152 of topological 2-groups and continuous homomorphisms between them such that both the resulting sequences @xmath153 @xmath154 are short exact sequences of topological groups .",
    "again , we can interpret this in terms of the associated crossed modules : if @xmath109 , @xmath137 and @xmath155 denote the associated crossed modules , then it can be shown that the sequence of topological 2-groups @xmath156 is exact if and only if both rows in the commutative diagram @xmath157 & h ' \\ar[r ] \\ar[d ] & h\\ar[r ] \\ar[d ] & h '' \\ar[d ] \\ar[r ] & 1 \\\\   1\\ar[r ] & g ' \\ar[r ] & g\\ar[r ] & g '' \\ar[r ] &   1}\\ ] ] are short exact sequences of topological groups .",
    "in this situation we also say we have a short exact sequence of topological crossed modules .    at times",
    "we shall also need a fourth viewpoint on topological 2-groups : they are strict topological 2-groupoids with a single object , say @xmath158 . in this approach ,",

    "segal @xcite realized that we can reinterpret a ech 1-cocycle as a _",
    "functor_. suppose @xmath28 is an open cover of @xmath1 . then there is a topological groupoid @xmath167 whose objects are pairs @xmath168 with @xmath169 , and with a single morphism from @xmath168 to @xmath170 when @xmath171 , and none otherwise .",

    "in fact , even more is true : two cocycles @xmath29 and @xmath179 subordinate to @xmath28 are cohomologous if and only if the corresponding functors @xmath180 and @xmath162 from @xmath167 to @xmath0 have a continuous natural isomorphism between them . to see this , note that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are cohomologous precisely when there are maps @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 we can draw this equation as a commuting square in the groupoid @xmath0 : @xmath181 ^ -{g_{ij}(x ) } \\ar[d]_-{f_i(x ) } & \\bullet \\ar[d]^-{f_j(x ) } \\\\   \\bullet \\ar[r]_-{g_{ij}'(x ) } & \\bullet } \\ ] ] this is precisely the naturality square for a natural isomorphism between the functors @xmath180 and @xmath162 .",
    "one can obtain ech cohomology with coefficients in a 2-group by categorifying segal s ideas .",
    "suppose @xmath6 is a topological 2-group and let @xmath44 be the corresponding topological crossed module .",
    "now @xmath6 is the same as a topological 2-groupoid with one object @xmath158 .",
    "so , it is no longer appropriate to consider mere _ functors _ from @xmath167 into @xmath6 .",
    "instead , we should consider _ weak @xmath43-functors _ , also known as ` pseudofunctors ' @xcite .",
    "for this , we should think of @xmath167 as a topological 2-groupoid with only identity 2-morphisms .",
    "let us sketch how this works .",
    "a weak 2-functor @xmath182 sends each object of @xmath167 to @xmath158 , and each 1-morphism @xmath174 to some @xmath175 .",
    "however , composition of 1-morphisms is only weakly preserved .",
    "this means the above triangle will now commute only up to isomorphism : @xmath183 where for readability we have omitted the dependence on @xmath184 .",
    "translated into equations , this triangle says that we have continuous maps @xmath185 satisfying @xmath186 this is precisely equation from section [ summary ] .",
    "for a weak 2-functor , it is not merely true that composition is preserved up to isomorphism : this isomorphism is also subject to a coherence law .",
    "namely , the following tetrahedron must commute : @xmath187{tetrahedron.eps }    \\put(-72,90){${}_{g_{jk}}$ }    \\put(-40,35){${}_{g_{jl}}$ }    \\put(-750,-5){$g_{il}$ }    \\put(-125,60){$g_{ik}$ }    \\put(-32.5,60){$g_{kl}$ }    \\put(-100,35){${}_{g_{ij}}$ }    \\put(-65,16){$h_{ijl}$ }    \\put(-66.5,40){$h_{ikl}$ }    \\put(-60,70){${}_{h_{jkl}}$ }    \\put(-100,72.5){${}_{h_{ijk}}$ }    \\put(-75,-5){$g_{il}$ } \\end{picture}\\ ] ] where again we have omitted the dependence on @xmath188 .",
    "the commutativity of this tetrahedron is equivalent to the following equation : @xmath189 holding for all @xmath190 .",
    "this is equation .",
    "a weak 2-functor may also preserve identity 1-morphisms only up to isomorphism .",
    "however , it turns out @xcite that without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath180 preserves identity 1-morphisms _",
    "strictly_. thus we have @xmath178 for all @xmath169 .",
    "we may also assume @xmath191 whenever two or more of the indices @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath54 are equal . finally , just as for the case of an ordinary topological group ,",
    "we require that @xmath180 is a _ continuous _ weak 2-functor we shall not spell this out in detail ; suffice it to say that the maps @xmath45 and @xmath194 should be continuous .",
    "we say such continuous weak 2-functors @xmath195 are * ech 1-cocycles * valued in @xmath6 , subordinate to the cover @xmath28 .    we now need to understand when",
    "two such cocycles should be considered equivalent . in the case of cohomology with coefficients in an ordinary topological group , we saw that two cocycles were cohomologous precisely when there was a continuous natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors . in our categorified",
    "setting we should instead use a ` weak natural isomorphism ' , also called a pseudonatural isomorphism @xcite .",
    "so , we declare two cocycles to be * cohomologous * if there is a continuous weak natural isomorphism @xmath196 between the corresponding weak 2-functors @xmath180 and @xmath162 .    in a weak natural isomorphism , the usual naturality square commutes only up to isomorphism .",
    "so , @xmath197 not only sends every object @xmath168 of @xmath167 to some @xmath198 , but also sends every morphism @xmath199 to some @xmath200 filling in this square : @xmath201 translated into equations , this square says that @xmath202 this is equation .",
    "there is also a coherence law that the @xmath203 must satisfy : they must make the following prism commute : @xmath204 at this point , translating the diagrams into equations becomes tiresome and unenlightening .",
    "it can be shown that this notion of ` cohomologousness ' of ech 1-cocycles @xmath205 is an equivalence relation .",
    "we denote by @xmath53 the set of equivalence classes of cocycles obtained in this way . in other words , we let @xmath53 be the set of continuous weak natural isomorphism classes of continuous weak 2-functors @xmath206 .    finally , to define @xmath207 , we need to take all covers into account as follows .",
    "the set of all open covers of @xmath1 is a directed set , partially ordered by refinement . by restricting cocycles defined relative to @xmath28 to any finer cover @xmath208",
    ", we obtain a map @xmath209 .",

    "in computing the limit above , it is sufficient to only consider _ good _ covers @xmath28 .",
