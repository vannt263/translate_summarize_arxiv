    "in 1946 , landau @xcite discussed the propagation of waves in unmagnetized plasmas and demonstrated that electrostatic oscillations ( langmuir waves ) of low amplitude can be damped in time , even in absence of collisional dissipation .",
    "the wave damping process is triggered by the resonant interaction of the wave with particles moving with speed close to the wave phase velocity @xmath0 .",
    "almost twenty years later , the landau theory has been extended to the nonlinear regime by oneil @xcite , who showed that the nonlinear process of particle trapping in the wave potential can saturate landau damping by flattening the particle velocity distribution in the velocity range close to @xmath0 : a langmuir wave can survive landau damping in the case its amplitude is large enough that nonlinear effects come into play in a time much shorter than the landau damping time . the predictions by oneil have been confirmed in several numerical works @xcite and also in laboratory plasma experiments ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in 1991 ,",
    "holloway and dorning @xcite noted that certain nonlinear electrostatic waves can propagate in a plasma at a speed comparable to the electron thermal speed @xmath1 , namely in a velocity range where they would be heavily landau damped in linear regime .",
    "they called these waves electron acoustic waves ( eaw ) , as their dispersion relation is of the acoustic form , and showed that the presence of a population of electrons trapped in the wave trough turns off landau damping .",
    "the excitation process of the eaws has been analyzed in numerical studies @xcite , where it has been shown that an eaw is a bernstein - green - kruskal ( bgk ) @xcite nonlinear mode , and in laboratory experiments with nonneutral plasmas @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the excitation of the eaw has been realized through an external driver electric field of relatively low amplitude which , if applied for several nonlinear times , traps resonant electrons and flattens the velocity distribution at @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , motivated by suggestions that eaws might be launched in laser - plasma interaction experiments @xcite , jonhston et al .",
    "@xcite focused on relatively large driver amplitudes .",
    "they found novel bgk waves that they called `` kinetic electrostatic electron nonlinear ( keen ) waves . ''",
    "these waves are comprised of four or five significant phase - locked harmonics , persist only when driven hard enough , and are driven by a wide range of frequencies .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite by means of kinetic numerical simulations that a slight deviation of the particle velocity distribution , consisting of a small plateau of the width of a very small fraction of @xmath1 , can give rise to new undamped modes , named corner modes , that are the small amplitude limit of the nonlinear eaws and can exist in a wide region of the @xmath2 plane ( @xmath3 being the real part of the wave frequency and @xmath4 the wavenumber ) .",
    "the corner modes are intrinsically similar to the so - called beam modes , i. e. the electrostatic acoustic branch of waves arising from the interaction of a background maxwellian plasma and a relatively low density electron beam .",
    "the beam modes have been introduced in 1968 by oneil and malmberg , who analyzed the nature of the roots of the plasma dielectric function in presence of a beam @xcite .",
    "the electron beam population , in fact , produces a slight deviation of the velocity distribution from maxwellian , as for the corner modes , this allowing for the existence of an acoustic - like branch of electrostatic waves .",
    "the interaction of a plasma with a particle beam is a physical phenomenon frequently observed in both space and laboratory plasmas and it is responsible for several dynamical processes , like , for example , the excitation of waves through instability mechanisms . in particular , in the solar wind , where the velocity distributions are routinely observed to deviate from the configuration of thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite ( with the appearance , for instance , of beams of accelerated particles ) , the presence of electrostatic slow waves with acoustic - like dispersion relation has been recently detected @xcite .    in this paper , we employ eulerian simulations of the vlasov - poisson equations to investigate the linear and nonlinear regime of propagation of the beam modes , in an unmagnetized plasma , composed of electrons and motionless protons .",
    "firstly , we revisit the linear results discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using a linear kinetic solver which computes numerically the electrostatic roots of the plasma dielectric function .",
    "afterwards , we employ the fully nonlinear vlasov - poisson code to study the nonlinear regime of the interaction of an electron beam , streaming at a speed close to @xmath1 , with a background maxwellian plasma .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : lindisp ] , we revisit the analytical , linear results described in ref .",
    "therefore , in section [ sec : numres ] we present the numerical vlasov - poisson code used to investigate the nonlinear system dynamics and discuss the numerical results .",
    "we finally summarize and conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "as discussed above , the presence of a beam in the equilibrium distribution function influences the linear dispersion relation , as a new branch of acoustic modes , called beam modes , is generated . in this section , by following ref .",
    "@xcite , we revisit the linear dispersion theory of the beam modes .",
    "we focus on a collisionless plasma composed of kinetic electrons and a background of neutralizing protons , in electrostatic approximation . under these assumptions ,",
    "the vlasov - maxwell set of equations can be reduced to the 1d1v ( one dimension in physical space , one dimension in velocity space ) vlasov - poisson ( vp ) system . in dimensionless units ,",
    "the vp equations read : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron distribution function and @xmath7 is the electric field . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vlas][eq : pois ] ) , time , lengths and velocities are scaled to the inverse electron plasma frequency @xmath8 , to the electron debye length @xmath9 and to the electron thermal velocity @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "moreover the electric field and the electron distribution function are respectively normalized by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the electron mass , equilibrium density and electric charge , respectively . for the sake of simplicity , from now on , all quantities are scaled using the characteristic parameters listed above .",

    "moreover , in order to avoid a net electron current density which could , in principle , break the electrostatic approximation , we imposed @xmath22 .",
    "typical parameters for the main and beam populations used for our numerical study are : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , while @xmath26 has been varied in the range @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity profile of the equilibrium distribution function @xmath28 , zoomed in the velocity range around the beam speed , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath29 ; here , a small bump generated by the low density cold electron beam is visible at @xmath30 .    in order to analyze the linear regime of wave propagation in presence of an electron beam , we employed a linear kinetic solver , which computes numerically the landau integral in the complex plane and solves for the roots of the dielectric function @xcite , when the equilibrium distribution function is chosen to be @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the dependence of the real part @xmath3 ( top ) and the imaginary part @xmath31 ( bottom ) of the wave frequency as a function of the wavenumber @xmath4 , for several values of @xmath26 ( @xmath26 increases going from the bottom to the top curve ) . as a reference , the dashed curve in fig .",

    ", the beam modes have an acoustic - like dispersion relation ( see the top panel of fig . [ fig2 ] ) , with phase speed @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , by looking at the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] , it is evident that the beam modes are damped for small values of @xmath26 and can become unstable as @xmath26 increases .    in figure [ fig3 ] , we report the contour plot of @xmath31 in the @xmath33 plane . the white - solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] represents the curve @xmath34=0 , which marks the transition between stable and unstable regions .",
    "it is clear from this plot that a large portion of the @xmath33 space is dominated by unstable solutions .",

    "( [ eq : vlas][eq : pois ] ) through an eulerian code based on an explicit finite difference method for the evaluation of spatial and velocity derivatives of the distribution function and on the well - known splitting scheme @xcite for the temporal evolution of @xmath35 ( see refs .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in physical space , while , in velocity space , we set @xmath41 . since periodic boundary conditions are implemented in physical space , poisson equation is solved through a standard fast fourier transform routine .",
    "finally , the time step @xmath42 has been chosen in such a way to satisfy the courant - friedrichs - levy @xcite condition for the numerical stability of time explicit finite difference schemes . in each numerical run",
    "described in the following , the initial equilibrium distribution function is @xmath28 in eq .",

    "we discuss the results of two simulation runs : i ) the propagation of a monochromatic beam wave in both linear and nonlinear regimes and ii ) the generation of isolated electrostatic structures produced by the nonlinear interaction of beam - modes and associated with the coalescence of phase space vortices .",
    "we perturb the initial equilibrium configuration described in the previous section through a density perturbation of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we follow the system evolution up to a time @xmath47 .",
    "the number of grid points in physical and velocity domain is @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .    to compare with the linear expectations for the beam - modes described in ref .",
    "@xcite and revisited in section [ sec : lindisp ] , we report , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the time evolution of the fundamental electric field spectral component @xmath50 ( corresponding to wavenumber @xmath51 ) .    in the early stage of the simulation ( left panel )",
    ", one observes the exponential damping of the langmuir oscillations initially excited by the density perturbation . the red - dashed line in fig",
    ". [ fig4 ] represents the theoretical prediction for the landau damping rate @xmath52 for langmuir waves , computed through the linear kinetic solver discussed previously .",
    "a very good agreement can be seen here between the theoretical expectation and the observed damping .    at @xmath53 , when the amplitude of the langmuir oscillations has been decreased by about two orders of magnitude , the wave damping effect saturates . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , reporting the electric signal evolution zoomed in the time interval @xmath54 $ ] , a clear frequency shift can be noticed ; from this time on , the electric oscillations occur with the frequency of the beam mode , as predicted by the linear kinetic solver .",
    "when looking at the complete time evolution of @xmath55 , reported in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , it is evident that , once the initial langmuir oscillations have been completely dissipated , the amplitude of the remaining beam mode increases exponentially .",
    "this is due to the fact that , with the parameters chosen for this simulation , the excited beam mode is unstable ( see figure [ fig3 ] for @xmath29 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "in fact , the red - dot - dashed line in this panel indicates the theoretical prediction for the growth rate of the beam mode @xmath57 , as obtained through the linear kinetic solver ; a very good agreement between theoretical expectation and numerical results can be again appreciated here . finally , in the late time regime , the exponential growth of @xmath55 saturates due to nonlinear effects and the wave amplitude oscillates around a nearly constant value .",
    "in figure [ fig5 ] we display the dependence of the spectral electric energy @xmath58 on the real part of the wave frequency @xmath3 ( resonance curve ) .",
    "as the spectral energy has been computed by fourier transforming the electric signal over the entire spatio - temporal domain of the simulation , two peaks are visible in the resonance curve : the first dominant peak at low frequency corresponds to the beam mode with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , while the second one is associated with the langmuir oscillations , with @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , which are damped in the early stage of the system evolution .",
    "the vertical red dot - dashed lines in this figure represent the frequencies of beam and langmuir waves respectively , computed through the linear kinetic solver .",
    "we move , now , to the analysis of the nonlinear evolution of the beam - mode instability observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , by focusing in particular on the nonlinear dynamics responsible for the saturation of the linear exponential growth . as demonstrated by oneil in 1965 @xcite ,",
    "nonlinear effects come into play in the process of resonant wave - particle interaction at a time of the order of the so - called trapping time @xmath63 , namely the oscillation period of a charge in the wave potential well .",
    "following oneil , in nonlinear regime , due to the presence of a population of trapped particles , the amplitude of an electrostatic wave oscillates in time over a period @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , we performed several simulations , by varying the amplitude of the initial density perturbation in the range @xmath65 , and computed the characteristic oscillation time @xmath66 of the electric wave envelope ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath67 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( left ) we report as dots the dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath69 , @xmath70 being the saturation amplitude of the electric oscillations in the nonlinear phase , evaluated as the average amplitude of the electric envelope oscillations after the saturation of the linear instability .",
    "the black solid line in this panel represents the best fit curve : @xmath71 as it is clear from this plot , the numerical dots show a clear linear trend , with a significantly high linear correlation coefficient ( @xmath72 ) ; the angular coefficient of the linear trend is @xmath73 , this meaning that @xmath66 is inversely proportional to the square root of @xmath70 , in good agreement with oneil s predictions .",
    "the above considerations suggest that particle trapping is at play in the nonlinear phase of the system evolution . to further confirm the existence of a population of trapped particles , in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the phase space contours of the electron distribution function at the end of the simulation and in the velocity range around @xmath26 , for the simulation with @xmath74 .",
    "the contour lines of the electron distribution function display a vortical structure , typical signature of particle trapping .",
    "moreover , the blue - dashed lines in this panel represent the separatrix curves defined as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , which separate the phase space region with closed lines ( trapped particles ) from those with open lines ( free particles ) .    finally , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot the distribution function @xmath35 at the end of the run as a function of the energy in the wave frame @xmath77 .",
    "that is , for each @xmath78 in the simulation domain , we plot @xmath79 vs @xmath80 , resulting in the single curve shown in fig .",
    "the fact that the points in this scatter plot fall on a single curve shows that the electron distribution @xmath35 is a function of the energy @xmath81 alone , as expected for solutions of the bgk type @xcite . from this evidence ,",
    "we conclude that the final nonlinear state reached after the saturation of the linear instability is , in fact , a bgk state .",
    "in this section we discuss the results of an additional simulation in which we impose a low amplitude random phase density noise on the equilibrium distribution function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) , with @xmath29 .",
    "the system evolution is followed up to a much longer time with respect to the previous run ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the parameters of this simulation are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ; in particular , we increased the beam density and decreased its temperature with respect to the previous run .",
    "moreover , @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 and @xmath49 .",

    "[ fig7 ] reports the time evolution of @xmath96 , in the time interval @xmath97 , for several spectral components ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the most unstable fourier component , @xmath99 , is plotted in red .",
    "the time evolution of this component shows a preliminary damping of the initial langmuir wave , as discussed in previous section , and then a linear instability phase , followed by a saturation in nonlinear regime .",
    "it is worth noting from this plot that the other fourier components start growing in amplitude once the most unstable mode has reached its saturation level , this suggesting that a nonlinear secondary instability took place to excite the whole fourier spectrum .    to analyze the characteristic of the wave signals shown above , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we report the @xmath100 fourier spectrum of the electric field .",
    "as shown in this plot , an acoustic branch has been excited , whose phase speed is @xmath101 , in good agreement with the prediction of the linear kinetic solver for the beam mode branch with the parameters used in this simulation .",
    "it is interesting to note in this plot that : ( i ) since the fourier spectrum has been taken over a long time interval ( @xmath102 ) , no signature of langmuir activity is recovered , as langmuir fluctuations have been rapidly landau damped after few wave cycles in the early stage of the system evolution ; ( ii ) the beam fluctuations propagate only along the positive @xmath103 direction ( positive values of the wavenumber ) , accordingly to the direction of propagation of the electron beam in the equilibrium distribution function [ see eq . ( [ eq : f0 ] ) ] .    at this point , it is interesting to look at the evolution of the phase space distribution function , as the linear instability develops , with the most unstable mode growing , and later on once the nonlinear regime has been reached and a significant energy has been transferred to high wavenumber spectral components . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we report the electric field signals ( left column ) at different times in the simulation and the corresponding phase space portraits of the electron distribution function ( right column ) . at @xmath104 ( top panels ) , in the middle of the linear instability phase , the electric field has the form of a small amplitude localized wave packet , corresponding to the most unstable wavenumber ( @xmath99 ) ; here , the amplitude of the electric field is too small to produce any significant deformation of the distribution function , whose level lines appear indeed unperturbed .    at @xmath105 , after the nonlinear saturation of the instability , many spectral components gained significant energy and the electric field amplitude has rapidly increased of many orders of magnitude ; now , particles are trapped in the wave potential and vortical structures appear in phase space . at later times ( @xmath106 ) , the whole fourier spectrum has been excited , high wavenumber components have energy comparable to the linearly most unstable mode and the electric field signal appears as a train of solitary structures , propagating along the positive @xmath103 direction ; to each electric field pulse corresponds a phase space vortex in the electron distribution function .",
    "these phase space vortices tend to merge and coalesce and , as a consequence , the number of electric pulses decrease in time ( @xmath107 ) . finally ,",
    "in the large - time regime ( @xmath108 ) , the last couple of phase space structures are coalescing , showing a tendency towards the formation of a single phase space vortex with a corresponding soliton - like electric field signal .",
    "we point out that the process of vortex merging occur on very slow time scales , whose final time asymptotic configuration is presumably reached in times beyond the maximum time of our simulation .",
    "in this paper we analyzed through a numerical approach the interaction of a beam of electrons with a background globally neutral plasma , both in linear and nonlinear regime . this problem has been already analytically approached by oneil and malmberg in 1968 @xcite in linear regime .",
    "these authors pointed out that the presence of the electron beam generates an additional wave branch of the electrostatic dielectric function , with acoustic dispersion relation , that they named beam modes .    in the first part of the present work",
    ", we revisited the results in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of a linear kinetic solver , which computes numerically the roots of the plasma dielectric function .",
    "the results of this preliminary linear analysis are in good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , confirming that the so - called beam modes have linear dependence of their frequency on the wavenumber and phase speed close to the beam speed .",
    "we also pointed out that , depending on the characteristics of the electron beam ( density , temperature and speed ) , the beam modes can become unstable .",
    "as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , it is possible to excite beam modes in a large portion of the @xmath33 space and most of the time the beam mode oscillations are unstable .",
    "we decided , therefore , to study in detail the excitation process of these beam modes , as well as the linear and nonlinear phase of their instability , since the interaction of a plasma with a beam is a relevant physical situation , frequently encountered both in space and laboratory plasma systems .",
    "to do so , we employed a numerical vlasov - poisson solver , which allows to follow the evolution of the electron distribution function in 1d-1v phase space .",
    "we performed two different numerical experiments , in which the equilibrium configuration , consisting in a background of maxwellian electrons and the electron beam ( plus motionless neutralizing protons ) is perturbed by small amplitude density disturbances ; in both simulations the typical parameters of the electron beam and of the initial perturbation are chosen in such a way to trigger the beam mode instability .    in the first simulation",
    ", we perturbed the equilibrium configuration with a monochromatic density perturbation .",
    "this simple situation allowed us to analyze in detail first of all the linear regime of the system evolution , making contact with the predictions of the linear kinetic solver : very good agreement has been found between numerical results and predictions of the linear solver concerning both real and imaginary part of the wave frequency .",
    "furthermore , we focused on the nonlinear saturation of the beam - mode instability , showing that the nonlinear regime of wave propagation is associated with the generation of a trapped particle population and , in general , to a phase space distribution function of the bgk type .    for the second simulation",
    ", we launched the electron beam in an initially maxwellian plasma with random density noise . by looking at the time evolution of several electric field fourier components",
    ", we observed the exponential growth of the amplitude of the most unstable one and then its nonlinear saturation , as in the previous run .",
    "however , once this mode has reached its nonlinear saturation amplitude , other fourier components start gaining energy , until the whole fourier spectrum is excited , following the acoustic - like dispersion relation of the beam modes . in the late time regime ,",
    "the resulting spatial profile of the electric field appears as a train of isolated pulses ; a phase space vortex in the electron distribution function is associated with each of these pulses .",
    "these vortices in phase space tend to merge and the electric pulses to collapse correspondingly : this dynamical evolution is expected to result in a single long - lived phase space structure , which propagates in time keeping unchanged its speed and shape ( the corresponding electric signal displaying a soliton - like profile @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that the generation of these electrostatic pulses is a pure nonlinear kinetic effect , as it is related to the kinetic processes of phase space vortex generation and merging .",

    "<S> eulerian simulations of the vlasov - poisson equations have been employed to analyze the excitation of slow electrostatic fluctuations ( with phase speed close to the electron thermal speed ) , due to a beam - plasma interaction , and their propagation in linear and nonlinear regime . in 1968 , </S>",

    "<S> , it is shown that , in the presence of a cold and low density electron beam , these beam modes can become unstable and then survive landau damping unlike the langmuir waves . when an electron beam is launched in a plasma of maxwellian electrons and motionless protons and this initial equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> is perturbed by a monochromatic density disturbance , the electric field amplitude grows exponentially in time and then undergoes nonlinear saturation , associated with the kinetic effects of particle trapping and phase space vortex generation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if the initial density perturbation is setup in the form of a low amplitude random phase noise , once the most unstable mode has reached its nonlinear saturation amplitude after the linear growth , the whole fourier spectrum of wavenumbers is excited . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the electric field profile appears as a train of isolated pulses , each of them being associated with a phase space vortex in the electron distribution function . at later times , these vortical structures tend to merge and , correspondingly , the electric pulses collapse , showing the tendency towards a time asymptotic configuration with a single phase space structure associated to an electric soliton - like pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamical evolution is driven by purely kinetic processes , possibly at work in many space and laboratory plasma environments . </S>"
