    "in generic hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom , the classical dynamics shows an enormous richness in structure , increasing with the interaction between degrees of freedom .",
    "the classical motion is mainly of two types , integrable and chaotic ; see [ 1 ] for details .",
    "this paper deals with the quantum properties of hamiltonians whose classical limit is chaotic .",
    "the strongly chaotic nature of underlying classical dynamics intutively suggest us to expect some kind of random behaviour in quantum dynamics too .",
    "this is because the classical dynamics is indeed a limit ( @xmath0 ) of quantum dynamics and therefore the nature of former should be somehow reflected in the latter .",
    "in fact , various analytical and numerical studies ( see [ 2 ] and references there in ) have confirmed that the manifestation of chaotic behaviour in quantum dynamics occurs through randomization ( partial or full ) of matrices of associated quantum operators .",
    "the spectral and strength fluctuations of these operators can be well - modeled ( up to second order correlations ) by one of the various universality classes of random matrices .",
    "most common among these are the gaussian orthogonal and unitary ensembles , goe and gue , the analogous circular ensemble models coe and cue [ 3 ] . the former pertain to autonomous systems whereas the latter have application in the study of non - autonomous systems such as quantum maps .",
    "the presence of rmt type spectra in quantum chaotic systems can be explained by the gutzwiller - semiclassical quantization scheme [ 4 ] for time - independent systems which uses the elegant technique of path integral sum given by feynman and relates the chaotic manifolds of classical dynamics to the eigenfunctions of quantum dynamics .",
    "a similar formulation is given for time - evolution operators of quantum maps too [ 5 ] .",
    "the spectral fluctuation measures can then be determined approximately by using the principle of uniformity [ 6 ] which is based on the uniform distribution of periodic orbits at large time scales and gives a technique to evaluate the sum of periodic orbit contributions . using this technique for autonomous hamiltonians ,",
    "berry [ 7 ] provided an explicit expression for the semiclassical form factor @xmath1 -the fourier transform of the @xmath2-level spectral correlation function - for values of @xmath3 in the range @xmath4 ( the time measured in units of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mean spectral density ) .",
    "this result has an exact analogy with the corresponding rmt behaviour ; following essentially the same technique as used by berry for autonomous hamiltonians , this analogy can be proved for quantum maps too [ 2 ] . in the region",
    "@xmath7 too , the limiting behaviour was analysed by berry using a semiclassical sum - rule which makes use of the properties of the function related to the quantum - mechanical density of states .    notwithstanding",
    "the good agreement between rmt and statistical quantum chaos up to @xmath8 order correlations ( long and very long ) , still there is no reason to believe that the random matrix theory ( rmt ) can model all @xmath9 order spectral as well as strength correlations .",
    "the numerical studies for many systems ( e.g baker map [ 8 ] , quantum kicked rotor [ 2 ] , etc . ) have already indicated that even second order correlation effects , when considered on short time scales ( i.e very long range correlations ) , do not follow random matrix prediction and are non - universal .",
    "this is the range where the classical dynamics is still diffusive and periodic orbits are not yet uniformly distributed .",
    "the deviation from rmt in this range agrees well with our intution as one should expect rmt to be applicable only on those time - scales where the variables associated with classical dynamics are random enough to fully randomize the matrices associated with corresponding quantum operators .",
    "moreover , the sum rules for the matrix elements of quantum chaotic operators [ 9 ] have already been found , differing from those of rmt . but",
    "a study of higher order correlations between zeros of reimann - zeta function shows a good agreement with rmt [ 10,11 ]    thus it is relevant to know as to what properties and up to what order the behaviour of quantum operators can be modeled by rmt and when it ultimately breaks down .",
    "our attempt , in this paper , is to make a comparative study of one such property , namely the @xmath9 order spectral correlation as all @xmath10-level spectral fluctuation measures can be expressed in its terms .",
    "we fufill this goal by carrying out a semiclassical study of the fourier transform of @xmath10-level correlation function @xmath11 ; the reason to consider the fourier tranform lies in the covenience of its analytical as well as numerical calculability .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "the gutzwiller formulation gives us the density of states as a sum over periodic orbits and this gives rise to periodic orbit- interaction terms in @xmath10-level density correlation function .",
    "berry , in order to obtain result for @xmath2-level form factor , neglected the contribution from these interacting terms as a first order approximation ( the so called diagonal approximation ) .",
    "but , for a complete evaluation of form factor , one has to calculate the contribution due to interacting terms .",
    "the lack of the knowledge of action correlations handicaps us from doing so .",
    "one attempt in this direction was made in ref.[12 ] , in which by assuming the complete validity of random matrix theory , the periodic orbit correlations were calculated from the rmt form factor .",
    "these when compared with numerically obtained correlations ( for baker map , hyperbola billiard and perturbed cat map ) showed a good agreement .",
    "the numerical study of these actions also indicated the presence of an uncorrelated component ( exponentially larger than correlated part ) ; in this paper we use this fact .",
    "we assume that , on long time scales as a first order approximation , actions are uncorrelated and calculate the @xmath9 order form factor . under this approximation ,",
    "the result turns out to be same as that of rmt which is also confirmed from the numerical analysis for at least two higher order fluctuation measures , given in this paper . for a complete calculation of @xmath9 order form factor , the action correlations should also be taken into account which will determine the higher order terms .",
    "in this paper , we present our semiclassical study for quantum maps but the method can easily be generalized for time- independent systems and one obtains the same results .",
    "similarly the rmt is given only for circular ensembles but , once again , the final results are valid for gaussian ensembles too which follows due to ge - ce equivalence for large dimensions ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    in section [ rmr ] , we briefly review the definition of various random matrix ensembles . for later use , we also discuss the relation between the @xmath10-level form factor and correlation functions .",
    "the section[qmc ] deals with a brief review of the fundamentals of quantum maps and the earlier obtained results for @xmath2-level form factor .",
    "both the section[rmr ] and section[qmc ] are included in this paper so as to clarify the ideas used in section[hsc ] which deals with the higher order correlations and form factos for the quantum spectra with exact symmetry . in section[nv ]",
    ", we numerically study the higher order fluctuation measures , namely , skewness and excess for a prototype quantum chaotic system , that is , kicked rotor and compare them with those of rmt .",
    "we summarize our results in section[con ] .",
    "we briefly outline here the results for @xmath9 order form factor ( i.e fourier transform of @xmath10-point density correlation function ) for the eigenvalues of the equilibrium circular ensembles of the random matrix theory .",
    "the circular type equilibrium ensembles are ensembles of unitary matrices @xmath12 in which the distinct non - zero matrix elements of u are distributed independently as zero - centered random variables ; @xmath13 defines the number of independent components of the matrix elements of u. there are three such ensembles , characterized by @xmath13 , namely coe , cue and cse for @xmath13=1,2 and 4 respectively .",
    "these universality classes are determined by the invariance of the system under time - reversal transformation ( tr ) ( or more generally antiunitary transformation ) and are described by the invariance of the ensemble measure : invariance under orthogonal or symplectic transformations for tr - invariant systems and under unitary transformations for tr - non - invariant ones .",
    "the invariance restricts the allowed space of matrices , for example , to that of symmetric unitary matrices for orthogonal invariance .",
    "the afore - mentioned unitarity of @xmath14 implies that its eigenvalues @xmath15 lie on the unit circle in the complex plane , where exponents @xmath16 s are termed as eigen - angles .",
    "the density of states is then defined by @xmath17 and has the mean value @xmath18 .    for analytical studies of the spectrum ,",
    "it is a usual practice to calculate the level density correlations . for cases where",
    "the level density @xmath19 can be written as the sum of a smooth part @xmath20 and a fluctuating component @xmath21 , it is preferable to study the correlations @xmath22 between the fluctuating parts of the density .",
    "the @xmath22 s can be defined as follows , @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 as the mean spacing and @xmath29 implying the averaging over variable @xmath30 for ranges containing sufficient number of mean spacings . by substracting @xmath20 from eq.(2.1 ) and using notation @xmath31 ,",
    "@xmath32 can further be written as follows , @xmath33 the substitution of eq.(2.4 ) in eq.(2.3 ) gives @xmath34\\right\\rangle_e    { \\rm exp}[id(\\sum_{m=1}^{k-1 } j_ml_m ) ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath35 implies the summation over all indices @xmath36 with each index varying from @xmath37 to @xmath38 except zero ( that is , none of the indices take value zero ) .",
    "the averaging over @xmath30 reduces the eq.(2.5 ) in following form , @xmath39   } \\\\   & = & { 1\\over n^k } \\sum_{j } { ' }",
    "{ < t_{j_1}t_{j_2} ... t_{-(\\sum_{m=1}^{k-1}j_m ) } } >   { \\rm exp}[id(\\sum_{m=1}^{k-1 } j_ml_m ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath40 implies the @xmath35 subjected to condition that @xmath41 . in semiclassical analysis , instead of dealing directly with @xmath22 ,",
    "it is easier to calculate the @xmath42 order form factor , defined as follows , @xmath43 }   r_k ( e_1 , ... , e_k ) de_1 ...",
    "de_{k-1 }   \\\\   & = & \\int exp{\\left[2\\pi i \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1 }   l_j \\tau_j \\right ] } r_k ( l_1 , ... , l_{k-1 } ) dl_1 ... dl_{k-1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substitution of eq.(2.5 ) in eq.(2.7 ) gives @xmath44 in terms of the traces , @xmath45 as in this study we confine ourselves to calculation of @xmath44 only for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , for these values of @xmath48 s only those terms in the @xmath49 contribute which have indices @xmath50 much less than @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath52 in eq.(2.5 ) can be replaced by @xmath53 in which the indices vary from some value @xmath54 to @xmath10 where @xmath55 with all other conditions same .    the above result for @xmath44 can further be simplified by using the recently obtained result for the statistics of the traces [ 13 ] which indicates that the first few traces @xmath56 of large unitary matrices ( @xmath51 large ) taken from any of the circular ensembles display no noticeble correlation .",
    "the ensemble average of each of the traces vanishes ( that is , @xmath57 ) for all the circular ensembles , due to uniformity of the distribution of @xmath58 s , the eigenangles ; see ref.[13 ] for details .",
    "but note that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are not independent of each other and one can show that[3,13 ] @xmath61 where @xmath13 is @xmath62 or @xmath2 depending on whether the ensemble is coe or cue respectively . therefore",
    ", in general , @xmath63 if at least one @xmath64 is such that its opposite @xmath65 is not present in the product .",
    "this product exists only if the following condition is satisfied , @xmath66 now , as can be seen from eq.(2.10 ) , for @xmath67-odd , every product appearing in the sum , contains odd number of @xmath64 s and therefore above condition can never be satisfied .",
    "this gives , for @xmath67-odd , latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath338 ( with @xmath51 odd ) and @xmath339 .",
    "the quantum dynamics has a time reversal symmetry @xmath166 for @xmath340 and a parity symmetry @xmath87 for @xmath341 .",
    "though the @xmath166-symmetry may be violated for @xmath342 , still a more generalized antiunitary symmetry @xmath343 can be preserved in the system if @xmath344 [ 14,2 ] . for @xmath345",
    ", the quantum dynamics is delocalized in the phase space and two point spectral fluctuation measures have been shown to be well modeled by various symmetry classes of rmt [ 14,2 ] . in the opposite limit of weak chaos , namely , @xmath346 , the eigenstates localize in the momentum space and one obtains a poisson distribution for the spectrum [ 2 ] . for numerical comparison of higher order measures with rmt ,",
    "therefore , we choose various parameters such that condition @xmath347 is always satisfied .      in this section , we numerically study skewness and excess , that is , the @xmath138 and @xmath139 order spectral fluctuation measure , for qkr - spectra and compare them with corresponding rmt results . although the @xmath42 order form factor can easily be calculated for quantum maps ( see eq.(2.10 ) ) , we choose to study @xmath325 and @xmath326 as corresponding numerical results ( for form factors ) in rmt are not available . but as both @xmath325 and @xmath326 can analytically be expressed in terms of @xmath138 and @xmath139-order correlations @xmath176 and @xmath208 ( see ref.[15 ] for these expressions ) and , therefore , are related to form factors @xmath194 and @xmath234 ( eq.2.8 ) , any conclusion about the validity of rm model for the former measure will be applicable for the latter too .",
    "both skewness and excess are the functions of @xmath138 and @xmath139 order central moment of a distribution respectively which contain the information about the probability of higher order events as compared to the lower order .",
    "more precisely , the skewness denotes the absence of symmetry in the distribution and can be defined as follows , @xmath348 the excess @xmath326 describes the difference between the kurtosis values ( i.e the fourth central moment calculated in units of the square of second central moment ) of the distribution and that of a normal distribution ( kurtosis=3 ) , @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the variance in the number of levels in a length of r mean spacings and @xmath351 and @xmath352 are corresponding @xmath138 and @xmath139 central moments . if excess is less than zero , the curve is platykurtic and if it is positive , leptokurtic .    for both @xmath325 and @xmath326 studies ,",
    "the spectral data consists of the eigenvalues of @xmath353 matrices of dimension @xmath354 obtained by diagonalizing @xmath14-matrix ( eq.(4.2 ) ) for various values of @xmath328 in the neighbourhood of @xmath355 .",
    "the choice of such a high value of @xmath328 is made to ensure the delocalization of quantum dynamics which makes @xmath14 a full random matrix ( see ref.[2 ] ) .",
    "due to strong sensitivity of the eigenvalues to small changes in @xmath328 , these sequences of quasienergies can be regarded as mutually independent .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath325 and @xmath326 of the qkr - spectra are displayed , as function of @xmath356 in figures @xmath62 and @xmath2;. for comparison , the corresponding rmt - results ( taken from ref.[15 ] ) are also given in each of the figures .",
    "the good agreement between qkr and rmt results , indicated by each of these figures reconfirms our semiclassical results obtained in section[hsc ] . furthermore ,",
    "as indicated by these figures , the higher order correlations e.g @xmath138 and @xmath139 order , seem to be very weak , nearly zero , at very long energy ranges and levels seem to be uncorrelated while strong correlation seem to be existing for short ranges .",
    "a continuously decreasing value of @xmath325 implies the tendency of the distribution to appear more and more symmetric as range of the distribution increases and finally acquire the gaussian form for long energy ranges .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by our @xmath326 study which shows a larger probability of higher order events for qkr at small energy ranges ( as compared to gaussian case ) while , for large energy ranges , it acquires the same form for both .",
    "we conclude this article with a summary of our principle results and a brief discussion of the open problems .    we have shown that , in long time limits",
    ", the higher order spectral correlations in quantum chaotic maps can be well modeled by corresponding ones in rmt . by using the example of kicked rotor",
    ", we have verified this numerically too .",
    "these results are also valid for conservative hamiltonians ; this follows due to the similar expressions for the level density in terms of classical periodic orbits for both the cases ( see ref.[4 ] for level density for autonomous case ) .",
    "the various summation formulas used to evaluate fluctuation measures such as sum over amplitudes ( appendix a ) , whose derivation depends on the uniform distribution of periodic orbits and therefore only on the strongly chaotic nature of dynamics , still remain valid .",
    "thus one obtains the similar results for form factors in autonomous systems .",
    "this should not be surprising , as both gaussian ensembles ( the ensembles of hermitian matrices and therefore of conservative hamiltonians ) and circular ensembles are known to have the same statistical behaviour in semiclassical limit [ 16 ] .",
    "although the study presented here deals with higher order correlations at fixed value of parameter , we expect the validity of random matrix model also for higher order parametric correlations in quantum chaotic spectra , but again only on long time - scales . the intuition , based on the analogy of @xmath8 order parametric density correlations for mesoscopic systems with a disordered potential , one dimensional many body hamiltonian ( calogero - sutherland model ) , scattering systems , quantum chaotic systems and random matrix models , as well as the existence of a common mathematical base ( nonlinear @xmath357-model and supersymmetry approach ) further encourages us to hope the extension of this analogy for higher order correlations too .",
    "the ignorance about action correlations on very long time scales handicaps us from doing the same analysis on these scales .",
    "it will also be of interest to study these correlations on short time scales .",
    "it is on these scales where @xmath8 order spectral correlations deviate from rmt and show non - universal behaviour .",
    "one expects to see similar deviations for higher orders too . for a complete understanding of higer order correlations in quantum chaotic systems ,",
    "therefore , one should study the action and periodic orbit correlations ; this will give us some insight in the behaviour of fluctuations in other systems ( above - mentioned ) too .",
    "we intend to do so in future .",
    "i would like to thank a.pandey for suggesting this study and j.p.keating and z.rudnick for various suggestions .",
    "i am grateful to ceb , institut henri poincare , paris and fachberich physik , universitat - ghs essen , germany too for support and environment in which this work could prosper .",

    "in large time - limits .",
