    "the @xmath0 meson  @xcite is composed of an anti - bottom quark @xmath14 and a charm quark @xmath11 .",
    "the presence of two relatively heavy quarks with different flavors is unique to the @xmath0 system and affects the decay and production properties . the theoretically predicted lifetime  @xcite is about a factor of three times smaller than that of other b mesons .",

    "the results presented here are based on a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath2 at @xmath23=1.96  tev collected by the cdfii detector .",
    "to measure the lifetime of the @xmath0 , we construct a per event lifetime that is defined using variables measured in the transverse plane .",
    "if all of the decay products of the @xmath0 decay are identified , the lifetime @xmath24 is the lifetime of the @xmath0  meson in its rest frame measured in units of microns of light travel time .",
