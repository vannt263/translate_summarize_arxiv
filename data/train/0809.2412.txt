    "ever since dirac first considered the possibility of a @xmath3 variable ( see @xcite ) , there have been numerous modifications of general relativity to allow for a variable @xmath0 nevertheless these theories have not gained wide acceptance .",
    "however , recently ( see @xcite-@xcite ) a modification has been proposed treating @xmath3 and @xmath4 as non - constants coupling scalars .",
    "so it is considered @xmath3 and @xmath4 as coupling scalars within the einstein equations , @xmath8 while the other symbols have their usual meaning and hence the principle of equivalence then demands that only @xmath9 and not @xmath3 and @xmath4 must enter the equation of motion of particles and photons .",
    "in this way the usual conservation law , @xmath10 holds . taking the divergence of the einstein equations and using the bianchi identities we obtain the an equation that controls the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath11 these are",
    "the modified field equations that allow to take into account a variable @xmath3 and @xmath11 nevertheless this approach has some drawbacks , for example , it can not derived from a hamiltonian , although there are several advantages in the approach .",
    "there are many publications devoted to study the variation of @xmath3 and @xmath12 in the framework of flat frw symmetries ( see for example @xcite-@xcite ) and all this works have been extended to more complicated geometries , like for example bianchi i models , which represent the simplest generalization of the flat frw models ( see for example @xcite-@xcite . in the context of perfect fluids and @xcite-@xcite in the context of viscous fluids ) .",
    "bianchi i models are important in the study of anisotropies .",
    "but in our opinion , the problem arises when one try to solve the resulting field equations ( fe ) .",
    "it seems that it is unavoidable to make simplifying hypotheses , or to impose ad hoc some particular behavior for some of the quantities of the model , in order to obtain a exact solution to the fe.such simplifying hypothesis are made for mathematical reason ( in order to reduce the number of unknowns ) although are justified form the physical point of view .",
    "usually such assumptions or simplifying hypotheses follow a power law , for example , the quantity @xmath13 follows a power law  i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an appropriate dimensional constant , @xmath16 is the cosmic time ( for example ) and @xmath17 ( usually @xmath18 but this other question ) , and depending on the nature of the quantity @xmath19 @xmath20 will be positive or negative .",
    "actually we think that although all these simplifying hypotheses are correct or at least bring us to obtain correct results , it is not necessary to do that , since they may be deduced from symmetry principles in such a way that one may justify ( deduce ) them from a correct mathematical principle , and usually all these approaches have physical meaning .    therefore the main goal of this paper is to apply the well known tactic ( approach ) of self similarity ( ss ) in order to study and find exact solutions for a perfect fluid bianchi i models with variable @xmath3 and @xmath21 but under the condition @xmath22 and trying to make the lowest number of assumptions or neither . we will try to show that with this approach all the usual simplifying hypotheses may be deduced from a correct mathematical principle .",
    "the paper is divided in the following sections .",
    "section two is devoted to outline all the ingredients as well as the field equations . in section three ,",
    "we study the model under the self - similarity hypothesis .",
    "we start this section introducing briefly some ideas about self - similarity and self - similar spacetimes .",
    "once we have found the homothetic vector field we go next to calculate the scale factors , where they obviously follow a power law solution , as well as the derived quantities from them as the hubble parameter @xmath23 the deceleration parameter @xmath24 and the shear @xmath25 since they only depend of the scale factors and will be the same for all the studied cases .",
    "we study four models .",
    "the first of them is the classical one i.e. where @xmath3 is a true constant and the cosmological constant @xmath4 vanish .",
    "we have preferred starting with this model in other to check how works the employed tactic .",
    "we emphasize that the obtained solution ( that will be the same in all the studied cases ) satisfies the condition , @xmath26 and @xmath27 relaxing in this way the kasner conditions ( @xmath28 @xmath29 only valid for a vacuum solution ) , but it is only valid for @xmath30 i.e. ultra - stiff matter , and where @xmath31 are the exponents of the scale factors . if @xmath32 the model collapse to the standard flat frw one .",
    "we then study the curvature invariants as well as the weyl tensor and its invariant , and end calculating the gravitational entropy .",
    "we show that the definitions of gravitational entropy do not work well in this kind of spacetimes , the self - similar ones , since these definitions are dimensionless which means that this quantity remains constant along the homothetic trajectories of any self - similar spacetime .",
    "we would like to relate in same way the behavior of the weyl tensor with the behavior of a @xmath3 time - varying .",
    "so after showing that the tactic works correctly , we pass to study a simple model where we consider that only vary @xmath33 in this case we get the same solution as in the above model with the same restriction for the equation of state i.e. the solution is only valid if @xmath34 in the third of the studied model we consider only a @xmath4 time - varying . as we have pointed out previously the solution is the same with regard to the exponents of the sale factors i.e. they must satisfy the conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 but in this case this solution is only valid iff @xmath37 i.e. @xmath38 since if @xmath39 , @xmath40 we find always that @xmath4 behaves as a negative decreasing time function",
    ". the last of the studied cases considers that both constants , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are time - varying .",
    "we find that @xmath3 is a decreasing time function ( i.e. has a similar behavior as the weyl tensor ) and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and as in the above case this solution is only valid @xmath43 if @xmath44 then",
    "@xmath45 we also show how to regain the classical  case where @xmath46 we end we a brief conclusions .",
    "throughout the paper @xmath47 will denote the usual smooth ( connected , hausdorff , 4-dimensional ) spacetime manifold with smooth lorentz metric @xmath48 of signature @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath47 is paracompact .",
    "a comma , semi - colon and the symbol @xmath50 denote the usual partial , covariant and lie derivative , respectively , the covariant derivative being with respect to the levi - civita connection on @xmath47 derived from @xmath48 .",
    "the associated ricci and stress - energy tensors will be denoted in component form by @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "a diagonal bianchi i space - time is a spatially homogeneous space - time which admits an abelian group of isometries @xmath53 , acting on spacelike hypersurfaces , generated by the spacelike kvs @xmath54 . in synchronous co - ordinates the metric is:@xmath55 where the metric functions @xmath56 are functions of the time co - ordinate only ( greek indices take the space values @xmath57 and latin indices the space - time values @xmath58 ) . in this paper",
    "we are interested only in _ proper diagonal _",
    "bianchi i space - times ( which in the following will be referred for convenience simply as bianchi i  space - times ) , hence all metric functions are assumed to be different and the dimension of the group of isometries acting on the spacelike hypersurfaces is three . therefore we consider the bianchi type i metric as @xmath59 see for example ( @xcite-@xcite ) .    for a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor : @xmath60 where we are assuming an equation of state @xmath61 .",
    "note that here we have preferred to assume this equation of state but as we will show in the following sections this equation may be deduced from the symmetries principles as for example the self - similar one .",
    "the @xmath62velocity is defined as follows@xmath63    the time derivatives of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related by the bianchi identities @xmath64 in this case this equation reads:@xmath65    therefore the resulting field equations are : @xmath66    now , we define @xmath67    since we have defined the 4-velocity by eq .",
    "( [ 4-vel ] ) then the expansion @xmath68 is defined as follows : @xmath69 and therefore the acceleration is : @xmath70 in this case @xmath71 while the shear is defined as follows : @xmath72@xmath73",
    "in general relativity , the term self - similarity can be used in two ways .",
    "one is for the properties of spacetimes , the other is for the properties of matter fields .",
    "these are not equivalent in general .",
    "the self - similarity in general relativity was defined for the first time by cahill and taub ( see @xcite , and for general reviews @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "self - similarity is defined by the existence of a homothetic vector @xmath74 in the spacetime , which satisfies @xmath75 where @xmath9 is the metric tensor , @xmath76 denotes lie differentiation along @xmath74 and @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "this is a special type of conformal killing vectors .",
    "this self - similarity is called homothety .",
    "if @xmath77 , then it can be set to be unity by a constant rescaling of @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 , then @xmath74 is a killing vector .",
    "homothety is a purely geometric property of spacetime so that the physical quantity does not necessarily exhibit self - similarity such as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a constant and @xmath83 is , for example , the pressure , the energy density and so on . from equation ( [ gss1 ] ) it follows that @xmath84 and hence @xmath85 a vector field @xmath74 that satisfies the above equations is called a curvature collineation , a ricci collineation and a matter collineation , respectively .",
    "it is noted that such equations do not necessarily mean that @xmath86 is a homothetic vector .",
    "we consider the einstein equations @xmath87 where @xmath52 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "if the spacetime is homothetic , the energy - momentum tensor of the matter fields must satisfy @xmath88 through equations  ( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ mattercoll ] ) . for a perfect fluid case",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) i.e. @xmath89where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the pressure and the energy density , respectively .",
    "then , equations  ( [ gss1 ] ) and ( [ emcoll ] ) result in @xmath92 as shown above , for a perfect fluid , the self - similarity of the spacetime and that of the physical quantity coincide .",
    "however , this fact does not necessarily hold for more general matter fields .",
    "thus the self - similar variables can be determined from dimensional considerations in the case of homothety .",
    "therefore , we can conclude homothety as the general relativistic analogue of complete similarity .    from the constraints ( [ ssmu ] )",
    ", we can show that if we consider the barotropic equation of state , i.e. , @xmath93 , then the equation of state must have the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a constant .",
    "this class of equations of state contains a stiff fluid ( @xmath96 ) as special cases , whiting this theoretical framework .",
    "there are many papers devoted to study bianchi i models ( in different context ) assuming the hypothesis of self - similarity ( see for example @xcite-@xcite ) but here , we would like to try to show how taking into account this class of hypothesis one is able to find exact solutions to the field equations within the framework of the time varying constants .",
    "the homothetic equations are given by eq .",
    "( [ gss1 ] ) so it is a straightforward task to find the homothetic vector field , where in this case is as follows:@xmath97    therefore , we have obtained the following behavior for the scale factors:@xmath98 with @xmath99 are integrating constants and @xmath100 in this way we find that@xmath101 with @xmath102    in this section we are going to study several bianchi i models and we will show how it is possible to find exact solutions to the field equations ( without the condition @xmath103 under the hypothesis of ss .    the time derivatives of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related by the bianchi identities i.e. eq . ( [ eq9 ] ) that in this case collapses to the following one:@xmath104 where @xmath105 is a function that depends on time and controls the time variation of the constant @xmath3 or / and @xmath11 if @xmath106 and @xmath4 vanish then @xmath107 so the model collapses to the standard one .",
    "this idea was pointed out by rastal ( see @xcite ) and improved ( in the theoretical framework of time varying constants ) by harko and mak ( see harko ) .",
    "therefore the resulting field equations are ( [ eq3]-[eq6 ] ) together to the new one @xmath108      in this case we consider @xmath107 so this means that @xmath106 and @xmath109 vanish and therefore we get that from eq .",
    "( [ beq9 ] ) that @xmath110    from the field equations ( [ eq3 ] ) we get that@xmath111 where @xmath112    the shear has the following behavior , @xmath113 , as it is observed @xmath114 as @xmath115 as in the previous sections , we may calculate the coefficients @xmath116 by solving the following system of equations:@xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119    so we have the following solutions for this system of equations:@xmath120 as it is observed only solution ( [ bsolss1 ] ) is interesting for us .",
    "the second solution is the usual frw one , so it is not  interesting for us ( see einstein&de sitter ( @xcite ) for @xmath121 , and harrison ( harrison ) @xmath122 .",
    "nevertheless we have found that solution ( bsolss1 ) verifies the conditions @xmath123 but iff @xmath30 ( see @xcite ) while other authors claim that must be satisfies the condition @xmath124 ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and in particular , in this context ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless we have found that this solution only verifies the first of the condition of the kasner like solutions i.e. @xmath125 while the second condition @xmath124 it is not verified ( see kasner  and  @xcite ) . in this case",
    "we find that it is verified the condition @xmath126 therefore we have found the same behavior as the obtained one in ( @xcite ) . before ending we would like to make a little comment about the kasner like solutions .",
    "if a solution of ( [ m1]-[m4 ] ) verifies the relationships @xmath127 i.e. they are kasner s type ( see @xcite , @xcite and in particular @xcite ) , then this means that @xmath128 ( i.e. the model is ricci flat)@xmath129 which brings us to get the following result : @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 we think that this class of solutions are unphysical and have a pathological curvature behavior as it is shown bellow .",
    "furthermore , as we can see , if @xmath133 then from eq .",
    "( [ m0 ] ) we get @xmath134 as it is expected for this class of solutions ( vacuum solutions ) so they are not interested for us . nevertheless relaxing the condition @xmath135 to our result i.e. @xmath136 ,",
    "we are able to obtain solutions whit @xmath137 , and @xmath138    therefore we have obtained the following behavior for the main quantities:@xmath139 so it is quite difficult to reconcile this model with the observational data . with regard to the energy density we find that@xmath140 and with regard to the constants @xmath141 we have that only obtain a bi solution iff @xmath142 ( where furthermore we suppose that @xmath143 and that this result only is possible if the equation of state is @xmath30 i.e. ultra - stiff matter ( see @xcite ) . for a review of bianchi",
    "i solutions see for example ( @xcite ) .",
    "with regard to the curvature behavior , we may see that the full contraction of the riemann tensor ( see for example @xcite-@xcite ) @xmath144 and the full contraction of the ricci tensor , @xmath145 are : @xmath146 where @xmath147 i.e.@xmath148 .\\ ] ] and the scalar curvature @xmath149 is : @xmath150    the non - zero components of the weyl tensor are:@xmath151 where the numerical constants @xmath152 as we can see with the obtained solution for @xmath31 the @xmath153 as @xmath154 in the next models we shall show that @xmath155 has the same behavior as the weyl tensor . in a forthcoming paper we study models with @xmath156 as @xmath157 ( i.e. models that verify the weyl tensor hypothesis ) and with a growing @xmath0 i.e. in same way exists a relationship between both quantities",

    "this implies that @xmath179 is constant along timelike homothetic trajectories . as a consequence , ( penrose )",
    "does not provide a measure of gravitational entropy along homotheticities and therefore @xmath179 can not be a candidate for a measure of gravitational entropy in self - similar spacetimes .      in this case",
