    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  a @xmath4 collider with center - of - mass energy @xmath5  tev  will begin taking data in the very near future .",
    "one of the primary missions of the lhc is to investigate the physics behind electroweak symmetry - breaking .",
    "since many of the most attractive candidate theories involve a higgs sector containing one or more light , scalar degrees of freedom , a great deal of effort has been invested into determining how best to search for these scalars ( and in particular the lightest cp - even scalar ) at the lhc ( see  @xcite ) . for a relatively light higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) , with @xmath6 ,",
    "the most favored channels are @xmath7 , @xmath8 . for a higgs with intermediate mass @xmath9 ,",
    "the most promising channel is the weak - boson fusion ( wbf )  @xcite process @xmath10  @xcite . for a heavier higgs , with @xmath11 , the channels of interest are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with the higgs produced through either gluon fusion or wbf  @xcite .    clearly",
    ", additional channels which might provide evidence for a light , cp - even higgs scalar in these mass ranges can also play a crucial role in higgs phenomenology .",
    "this is especially true if the higgs sector realized in nature turns out to be more complicated than the single @xmath14 doublet of the sm . in such cases , the most promising discovery channels could turn out to be quite different from those pertinent to a sm higgs boson  @xcite . for this reason",
    ", it has become increasingly clear that channels for which the significance of discovery for a standard model higgs is low may be of crucial importance for detecting whatever variety of higgs boson is actually out there  provided of course that nature employs a scalar higgs sector to break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "if a light , cp - even higgs boson is discovered early at the lhc , within the first @xmath15 of data , processes which can put the most stringent bounds on parameters such as its mass , its couplings to the standard model fermions , etc .  will become increasingly important for precision analyses of the higgs sector that could point the way toward new physics .",
    "one higgs - decay channel that is of particular interest is @xmath16 .",
    "the primary advantage of this channel is that a signal involving a pair of high-@xmath17 muons will be easy to identify at the lhc .",
    "indeed , the muon - identification efficiency at the lhc detectors is more that 90%@xcite .",
    "once a higgs boson is discovered in this channel , its mass could be readily reconstructed with high precision .",
    "additionally , such a channel could be used in determining the muon yukawa coupling .",
    "this is of particular interest because most of the existing literature on the measurement of higgs - boson yukawa couplings focuses on the third generation yukawa couplings , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , @xmath21 processes could be important for determining whether or not the effective higgs yukawa couplings are indeed generation - universal .",
    "the difficulty with @xmath16 processes is the small higgs branching fraction into muon pairs , both in the standard model  in which it is of @xmath22  and in most simple extensions of the higgs sector . indeed , under the assumption of universal yukawa couplings among the lepton generations , the small size of the muon mass @xmath23 compared to @xmath24 results in @xmath25 being roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , while a great deal of attention has been focussed on processes in which the higgs boson decays to a tau pair ( for example , weak - boson fusion with @xmath27 is now regarded as one of the promising discovery channel for the sm higgs in the intermediate mass region  @xcite ) , @xmath21 processes have not been extensively considered .",
    "nevertheless , some parton - level studies have been carried out : investigations of @xmath28 and the weak - boson fusion process @xmath29 at the lhc were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "it was found that by combining the results from both of these channels , an observation of @xmath21 at the @xmath2 level could be obtained with @xmath30 of integrated luminosity for low higgs masses .",
    "higgs decays to muon pairs in the minimal supersymmetric standard model have also been studied ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this letter , we examine the associated higgs production process @xmath31 with @xmath21 at the lhc . while the rate for this process is far smaller than that for the @xmath32 channel discussed in  @xcite , a muonic final state has a number of advantages .",
    "perhaps the most significant of these is that the final - state muon pair affords an exceptionally good higgs - mass resolution  of similar order ( around 1% ) to that afforded by @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the absence of any additional sources of missing energy for semileptonic top decays ( beyond the single neutrino from @xmath34 ) reduces the uncertainty in top - quark reconstruction .",
    "we show that , for a sm higgs boson with a mass around 120  gev , the statistical significance of discovery in the @xmath35 channel is on the same order as that obtained from the gluon fusion and wbf channels .",
    "we also investigate the prospects for detecting a sm higgs boson via its decays to muon pairs using the combined gluon fusion , wbf , and @xmath31 channels , and discuss the potential implications for higgs discovery using the @xmath36 channel in beyond - the - standard - model scenarios .",
    "for a sm higgs sector , the @xmath35 channel will be useful primarily in the case where the higgs boson is light : @xmath37 .",
    "( the production cross - sections drop quickly for heavier higgs masses . ) here , we present results for the specific choices @xmath38  gev , 120  gev , 130  gev , and 140  gev .",
    "the leading - order ( lo ) @xmath31 production cross - section and higgs branching fraction to muons for each of these choices are listed in table  [ tab : sigbr ] .",
    "the former were calculated using the madgraph package  @xcite , with factorization and renormalization scales both set to @xmath39 ; the latter were calculated using hdecay  @xcite .",
    "it is apparent from table  [ tab : sigbr ] that the leading - order ( lo ) @xmath31 production cross - section for a higgs boson in this mass range at the lhc ranges from around 350 to 600  fb , while the higgs branching fraction to muons is of @xmath40 , as discussed above .",
    "since this implies a rather small overall rate for @xmath35 events , we would like to include in our analysis all final states which permit an unambiguous reconstruction of both @xmath41 and @xmath42 from their decay products .",
    "these include processes in which both @xmath43 bosons decay hadronically ( 45.7% of the time ) and semileptonic decays in which the charged lepton is either an electron or a muon ( 28.8% of the time ) .",
    "therefore , we study two types of signals :    * hadronic signatures : 6 jets @xmath44 @xmath45 , * semileptonic signatures : 4 jets @xmath44 @xmath46 @xmath44 missing @xmath47 , @xmath48 .    for fully - leptonic @xmath0 decay , the masses of the top quarks can not be completely reconstructed , due to the presence of multiple neutrinos in the final state .",
    "we therefore do not consider this final state in our results , but note that a more detailed analysis based on kinematical distributions as in the top - mass reconstruction methods of  @xcite could perhaps render this channel useful .",
    "it may be noted that no distinction between @xmath49-jets and other jets was made in the definition of signals ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath49-tagging is not used in this analysis and that the cuts outlined below are applied to all jets , irrespective of their @xmath49-character .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath49-tagging efficiency at atlas is around 50%  @xcite ( the efficiency at cms is comparable ) , which would lead to a substantial loss in signal events .",
    "however , we shall justify this procedure below and show that the relevant reducible backgrounds can be effectively eliminated merely by demanding that @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath50 and both @xmath43-bosons , can all be appropriately reconstructed from the momenta of the final - state particles .",
    ".leading - order ( lo ) sm @xmath31 production cross sections at the lhc and higgs branching ratios to muons for several different values of the higgs mass @xmath51 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     3.0 truein    we have shown that the @xmath35 channel can provide @xmath52 evidence for a light , sm higgs boson around 115  gev . in non - standard model higgs scenarios , however , the branching ratio for @xmath21 and/or @xmath31 production cross section might potentially be enhanced , rendering this channel even more significant for higgs - boson detection .",
    "depending on the enhancement factor , a @xmath53 discovery might even possible  and at a reasonably low integrated luminosity . in order to quantify these effects",
    ", we define an overall enhancement factor @xmath54 , which represents the net effect of all modifications to @xmath55 and the @xmath31 production cross - section in a given extension of the sm higgs sector : @xmath56_{np } } { [ \\sigma(pp\\rightarrow t\\bar{t}h)\\times { \\rm br}(h\\rightarrow",
    "\\mu\\mu)]_{\\rm sm}}. \\label{eq : kappadef}\\ ] ]    figure .",
    "[ fig : kappas ] shows the enhancement factor @xmath54 as a function of higgs mass for a @xmath2 or @xmath53 discovery at the lhc with @xmath57 of integrated luminosity . for values of @xmath51 in the range @xmath58 gev ,",
    "an enhancement factor of @xmath59 ( depending on @xmath51 ) is sufficient to result in a @xmath2 excess , while @xmath60 will result in a @xmath53 excess in the combined @xmath35 channels and the clear discovery of a beyond - the - standard - model higgs boson .",
    "in this letter , we have investigated the observability of a light , cp - even higgs boson at the lhc in the channel @xmath35 .",
    "we have shown that for a light sm higgs boson with a mass around 120  gev , evidence for a standard model higgs can be obtained in this channel at roughly the same significance level as in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 channels , and with comparable higgs - mass resolution .",
    "the best statistical significance is obtained in the fully hadronic mode .",
    "moreover , we have shown that for @xmath51 between 115  gev and 130  gev , the combined results from the gluon - fusion , weak - boson fusion , and @xmath31 channels , with @xmath50 decaying to @xmath45 , can provide evidence for a sm higgs boson at about @xmath2 or better with @xmath30 of integrated luminosity . in beyond - the - standard - model scenarios in which the @xmath31 production cross - section and/or the branching fraction @xmath63 are enhanced relative to their sm values , this channel could become extremely important for the detection and analysis of a light higgs boson , providing an accurate measurement of the higgs mass , and a precise determination of the muon yukawa coupling .",
