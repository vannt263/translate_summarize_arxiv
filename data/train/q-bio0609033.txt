    "living organisms depend simultaneously on a stable internal environment and a capability to adapt to a fluctuating external environment  @xcite .",
    "since the biological characteristics of an organism are determined by the interplay between its gene repertoire and the regulatory apparatus  @xcite , robustness and adaptiveness should be generic features of the molecular interactions composing the gene regulation machinery .",
    "the organization of the gene transcriptional regulatory network has been analyzed for numerous organisms , in particular for the prokaryote _ escherichia coli _",
    "coli _ )  @xcite and the eukaryote _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ( _ s .",
    "cerevisiae _ )  @xcite .",
    "adaptivity of an organism implies the production of different cell types with different functions from the same genome .",
    "this begins with a regulated transcription by certain proteins , transcriptional factor ( tf )  @xcite .",
    "the identification of the target genes for each tf allows the construction of a gene transcriptional regulatory network , where the nodes are the genes or operons that produce tf s or are regulated by tf s , and the directed edges indicate a regulatory dependence : a directed edge from node @xmath0 to node @xmath1 implies that a tf encoded by gene @xmath0 is involved in the regulation if the expression of gene @xmath1 .",
    "the expression level of each gene defines the dynamical state of the network . to achieve robustness and adaptiveness at the same time one expects the regulatory network dynamics to be neither chaotic nor fully insensitive to perturbations , but marginally stable .",
    "structural characteristics of the network must support these dynamical features .",
    "our study reveals specific topological features in the transcriptional regulatory network architecture of _",
    "e. coli _ and _ s. cerevisiae _ that shift the dynamics towards marginal stability .",
    "_ e. coli _ s network has a very low mean connectivity , the number of edges per node , which would lead in random networks to a high stability thus deteriorating adaptiveness .",
    "but we find that single - element circuits which are anomalously rich in _ e. coli _ s network help mutations triggered by random perturbations to persist , favoring an unstable dynamical behavior .",
    "_ s. cerevisiae _ on the other hand has a sufficiently high mean connectivity which favors chaotic dynamics in random networks deteriorating stability .",
    "here we find that _ s. cerevisiae _",
    "s network has a broad ( algebraic ) node degree distribution and we demonstrate the stabilizing effect of this feature upon the dynamics .    practically , the information about the transcriptional regulatory network structure - which tf binds to which gene - is available via the chromatin - immunoprecipitation microarray experiments  @xcite . the question , whether a specific tf enforces or inhibits the expression of a specific target gene , has to be studied separately .",
    "however , those individual interactions do not necessarily occur independently and these regulatory interactions are often combinatorial  @xcite and time- , cell cycle- , or environment - dependent , limiting the available information on the complete regulation profile .",
    "generic dynamical features then have to be extracted using model interactions as suggested by kauffman  @xcite : one digitizes the continuous expression level to a boolean variable , @xmath2 ( inactive ) and @xmath3 ( active ) , and assumes a random static regulation rule for each gene in the form of a random boolean function for each gene determining its state at the next time step by the current states of its regulators . here _",
    "random _ means that the output value of these boolean functions is @xmath2 or @xmath3 with equal probabilities .    based on considerations of random boolean networks with a fixed number of regulators @xmath4 for every element ,",
    "kauffman @xcite hypothesized that distinct stationary states - limit cycles - correspond to different types of cells .",
    "this idea got some support from the agreement of the scaling behavior of the number of limit - cycles for @xmath5-random boolean networks and the number of cell types with respect to the genome size , but was also debated  @xcite . among networks with fixed in - degree , @xmath5 is a critical point distinguishing two different dynamical phases : stable and unstable against perturbations , suggesting that the regulatory network dynamics of living organisms is  on the edge \" between order and chaos  @xcite .",
    "however , real regulatory networks do not have a fixed in - degree but a heterogeneous connectivity , even their average in - degree @xmath6 is usually different from @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless the boolean model itself is useful , and recently the effects of the nature of the regulating rules on the dynamical stability were studied within its framework  @xcite .",
    "we propose that the network structure itself is also relevant for the stability / instability aspect mentioned before .",
    "therefore we construct a network from the data for the transcriptional regulatory interactions for _ e. coli _ and _ s. cerevisiae _ , and study how a point mutation , i.e. , an altered dynamical state of a single element , spreads over the whole network by inducing another mutation through regulatory interactions .",

    "e. coli _ and _ s. cerevisiae _ and provided analytical confirmation for the results by analyzing their structural features . while the small number of edges per node in _ e. coli _ fundamentally prohibits a global spread of mutation , a relatively large number of edges in _ s. cerevisiae _ enables a global mutation conditionally depending on the regulating rules .",
    "we further identified the relevant structural features which are distinguished from those of random graphs : all circuits of the regulatory network of _",
    "e. coli _ are single - element circuits and the in - degree distribution of _ s. cerevisiae _ takes a power - law form .",
    "single - element circuits in _ e. coli _ have higher probability to be mutated than nodes without self - regulation . the broad in - degree distribution in _ s. cerevisiae _ smoothens the increase of the number of mutated elements .",
    "this increase would be sharper for an exponential distribution , as is the case in the random graphs .",
    "these biological networks appear to follow design principles that tend to balance the size of mutation .",
    "the small mean connectivity of the regulatory network of _",
    "e. coli _ would restrict the size of mutations drastically , which is compensated by the abundance of single - element circuits that lead to the required enhancement of the mutation size . in the case of _",
    "s. cerevisiae _ , its global characteristics of the regulatory network , a mean connectivity larger than 2 , would lead to a very large mutation size , but a very heterogeneous interconnectivity pattern suppresses it .",
    "these local structural features demonstrate that both genetic networks have evolved , in spite of the restrictions imposed by the global characteristics , in such a direction that they can stay dynamically between stable ( i.e. , rarely mutated on a global scale ) and unstable ( easily mutated ) .",
    "being neither stable nor unstable appears to be necessary for living organisms to maintain their stable internal state and adapt itself to fluctuating external environment simultaneously .",
    "therefore our finding suggests that such a marginal dynamic stability of the whole system is supported by a selected structural organization of the internal systems on smaller scales , as the transcriptional regulatory network studied in this work .",
    "while we have concentrated only on the average in - degree , the organization of circuits , and the in - degree distribution of the network , further structural analysis will be helpful to illuminate how structure supports function .",
    "we thank uri alon and richard a. young for allowing us to use their data .",
    "this work was supported by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) .",
