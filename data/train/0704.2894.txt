    "theoretical studies of quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd ) in non - perturbative regimes indicate that qcd matter has a rich phase structure  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram can be parameterized by temperature @xmath6 and baryo - chemical potential @xmath7 . based on the phase diagram",
    ", we can obtain perspectives on how the vacuum structure of the early universe evolved in extremely high temperature states after the big bang as well as what happens in extremely high baryon density states such as in the core of neutron stars .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the qcd phase diagram is one of the most important subjects in modern nuclear physics . at a minimum",
    "we expect the phase diagram to exhibit at least two distinct regions : the deconfined phase where the basic degrees of freedom of qcd , quarks and gluons , emerge ; and the hadron phase where quarks and gluons are confined .",
    "there is a first order phase boundary at @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite . at @xmath10 and @xmath11 a smooth crossover transition is expected due to finite masses of quarks  @xcite .",
    "logically we can then expect that a critical end - point ( cep ) exists at the end of the first order phase transition line  @xcite .",
    "the location of the cep would be a landmark in understanding the whole structure of the phase diagram .",
    "although numerical calculations using lattice gauge theory , as well as model calculations , predict the existence of the cep , none of them have reached a quantitative agreement on the location at present precision  @xcite .",
    "therefore experimental investigations are indispensable to pin down the location , and to establish properties of the phase point based on fundamental observables .    strongly interacting ,",
    "high - density matter has been created in nucleus - nucleus collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider  ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory  ( bnl )  @xcite .",
    "strong suppression of hadrons at high transverse momentum  ( @xmath12 ) observed in central au+au collisions at @xmath13gev at rhic indicate creation of high density matter  @xcite .",
    "strong elliptic flow indicates that the matter thermalizes rapidly and behaves like a fluid with very low viscosity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the valence quark number scaling of elliptic flow suggests that quark - like degrees of freedom are pertinent in the evolution of the flow  @xcite .",
    "those observations naturally lead us to the expectation that the initial thermalized state of matter is at @xmath14 in central au+au collisions , and possibly at @xmath15 in the most peripheral collisions .",
    "therefore a system with initial @xmath16 may exist somewhere between peripheral and central collisions .    since there could be different @xmath17 s depending on order parameters in the crossover transition  @xcite , it is worth measuring different kinds of order parameters .",
    "it is known that density correlations in matter are robust observables for critical temperatures in general  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter we will focus on here is spatial density fluctuations . following the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) framework  @xcite we expect a correlation between fluctuations in density at different points which lead to a two - point correlation function of the form of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the one dimensional distance",
    ", @xmath20 is the strength of the correlation , and @xmath21 is the spatial correlation length .",
    "this functional form can be derived from the gl free energy density by expanding it with a scalar order parameter which is small enough ( see appendix [ ap : deri ] ) .",
    "a large increase of @xmath22 near @xmath17 can be a good indicator for a phase transition .",
    "in addition to @xmath22 itself , the product @xmath1 can also be a good indicator of a phase transition . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : observable ] , @xmath1 behaves as @xmath23 . in the gl framework",
    ", this quantity is related to the medium s susceptibility in the long wavelength limit .",
    "( see appendix [ ap : deri ] for the derivation ) . the matter produced in the collision expands longitudinally from its earliest time , which leads to cooling after the initial thermalization .",
    "if the system s evolution takes it near a critical point as it cools , then the large correlated density fluctuations will appear as @xmath6 approaches @xmath17 from above .",
    "if the expansion after that point is rapid enough then these fluctuations can potentially survive into the final state  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , spatial density fluctuations in longitudinal space @xmath24 in the early stage of an @xmath25 collision at rhic can be measured as the density fluctuation in rapidity , or pseudorapidity , space in the final state .",
    "the differential length @xmath26 between neighboring medium elements at a common proper time @xmath27 is expressed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is rapidity . if we limit the study to only a narrow region around midrapidity , then @xmath30 is valid with the approximation of @xmath31",
    ". therefore we can observe density fluctuation in @xmath24 coordinate as being mapped onto density fluctuations in rapidity space .",
    "in the region around midrapidity used in this analysis we can approximate rapidity by pseudorapidity ( @xmath32 ) for inclusive charged particles , since the mean  ( = 0.57  gev / c @xmath33 ) observed in  @xmath34gev collisions at rhic is so high .    in this paper",
    "we measure charged particle density correlations in pseudorapidity space to search for the critical phase boundary in au+au collisions at @xmath13gev .",
    "the density correlation is extracted from inclusive charged particle multiplicity distributions measured as a function of pseudorapidity window size  @xmath35 .",
    "negative binomial distributions  ( nbd ) are fit to the measured multiplicity distributions , and the nbd parameters @xmath36  ( mean ) and @xmath37  ( deviation from a poissonian width ) are determined .",
    "the product of the correlation strength @xmath20 and the correlation length @xmath22 is extracted from a known relation between the product of @xmath1 and the nbd @xmath38 parameter as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "we expect a monotonic correspondence between initial temperature and measured energy density based on bjorken picture  @xcite which in turn has a monotonic relation with the number of participant nucleons  in a collision  @xcite .",
    "thus the critical behavior of @xmath1 near @xmath17 can be observed as a non - monotonic increase as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting that most of experimentally accessible points on the phase diagram are neither phase boundaries nor the end - point .",
    "therefore , before searching for a special phase point such as cep based on particular theoretical assumptions , we would rather observe and define phase boundaries by general methods .",
    "the application of the gl framework for density correlations far from @xmath17 provides this approach .",
    "it is known that the gl framework is not applicable directly at @xmath41 because the fluctuations become too large to be described consistently .",
    "the correlation length @xmath22 can not be defined at @xmath17 , where many length scales from small to large emerge .",
    "this is the origin of the power law behavior , or fractal nature of fluctuations at the critical phase boundary .",
    "however , in the regions relatively far from @xmath17 , the fluctuations are naturally expected to be small . therefore the gl approach is suitable in the nuclear collision environment as long as the system approaches a phase boundary from a thermalized state with @xmath6 well above @xmath17 . as a future prospect ,",
    "once we define a phase boundary even in the crossover region , we can further investigate the characteristic nature of the phase point , such as critical exponents based on the chiral condensate  @xcite along the phase boundary , to judge whether the point corresponds to cep or not .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] , in addition to the discussion on the observed  dependence of @xmath42 , other possible sources of correlation between inclusive charged particles are discussed .",

    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "[ ap : deri ] , the density correlation length and susceptibility are exactly defined based on the gl framework . finally , in appendix  [",
    "ap : table ] all measured nbd parameters in all collision centralities are tabulated .",
    "in this analysis the density fluctuation will be discussed via charged particle multiplicity distributions as a function of the pseudorapidity window size for each collision centrality or  range .",
    "it is known that the charged particle multiplicity distributions are empirically well described by the negative binomial distribution  ( nbd ) in @xmath25 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the distribution is expressed as @xmath45 here @xmath36 is the mean of the distribution and @xmath37 corresponds to the difference between its width and that of a poisson with that mean .",
    "thus the nbd coincides with the poisson distribution in the case of @xmath46 , and with the bose - einstein distribution in the case of @xmath47 . in this sense ,",
    "the nbd @xmath38 directly reflects the degree of correlation between the particles produced into the experimental window .",
    "we can relate the @xmath38 parameter for the multiplicity distribution within an @xmath32 window to the correlation between phase - space densities in different @xmath32 windows .",
    "specifically @xmath38 can be mathematically related with the second order normalized factorial moment  @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath48 corresponds the integrated two - particle correlation function , which can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of produced particles and @xmath35 is the pseudorapidity window size inside which the multiplicities are measured . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2c2 ] ) we introduced one- and two - particle inclusive multiplicity densities @xmath52 and @xmath53 based on the inclusive differential cross section relative to the total inelastic cross section @xmath54 as follows  @xcite @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the average density per unit length within @xmath35 which is defined as @xmath57 with these densities , the two particle density correlation function is defined as @xmath58 instead of measuring @xmath59 or @xmath48 directly , in this analysis we extract the nbd @xmath38 parameter as a measure of particle correlations over @xmath32 .",
    "this is partly for historical reasons  @xcite , but also because , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we can correct the measurement of @xmath38 for the detector imperfections in a very robust way by using a statistical property of nbd , while the same correction made at the level of @xmath48 would require additional information on the parent distribution .",
    "the normalized two particle correlation function  @xmath59 in the experiment can be parametrized as follows , based on the one - dimensional functional form obtained in the gl framework ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fg2 ] ) ) : @xmath60 where @xmath56 is proportional to the mean multiplicity in each collision centrality bin , or range of , and the scale factor @xmath20 is the strength of the correlations at the zero separation .",
    "the constant term @xmath61 arises from any kind of experimental and physical correlations which are independent of the pseudorapidity separation , such as the residual effect of finite centrality binning .",
    "further , one has to take into account the fact that the damping behavior in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fg2 ] ) is caused only by the spatial inhomogeneity of the system at a fixed temperature .",
    "in realistic collisions and event samples there is no single relevant temperature .",
    "for instance , finite centrality binning adds together a range of fluctuations originating from collisions with different .",
    "however , in principle these centrality - correlated fluctuations are independent of the thermally - induced spatial fluctuations .",
    "in addition , although the self correlation at the zero distance between two sub - volumes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g2 ] ) was excluded , the self correlation can not be excluded in the integrated two particle correlation function contained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2c2 ] ) . we have tried various kind of functional forms for @xmath59 which contained power terms and also plural correlation lengths . however , we found empirically that just adding the constant term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nomc2 ] ) produced the best fit results to all data points .",
    "finally , the relation between the nbd @xmath38 parameter and the pseudorapidity window size @xmath35 can be obtained by the substitution of eq .",

    "the product is related to the susceptibility in the long wavelength limit , @xmath65 for a given temperature @xmath6 based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : sus ] ) . combined with the parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nomc2 ] ) , the @xmath42 product should then follow @xmath66 since we expect that @xmath56 is a monotonic function of @xmath6 , in the limit of @xmath6 far from @xmath17 , @xmath42 should vary monotonically as a function of @xmath6 . however , if @xmath6 approaches @xmath17 , the @xmath42 product will show a singular behavior .",
    "therefore , any non - monotonic increase of @xmath42 could be an indication of @xmath67 near a critical point . if the experimental bias term @xmath61 is excluded in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) , the slope in @xmath38 versus @xmath35 thus contains crucial information on the phase transition .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in this method , correlations on scales even smaller than the minimum @xmath35 window can be meaningfully discussed based on the differences of the nbd @xmath38 as a function of @xmath35 window sizes , since the correlations are always integrated from the limit of the detector resolution to @xmath35 window size .",
    "phenix is one of four experiments operating at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the phenix detector has two central spectrometer arms , denoted east and west .",
    "each central arm covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath68  @xmath69  0.35 and subtends an azimuthal angle range @xmath70 of @xmath71 around the beam axis  ( @xmath24  direction ) .",
    "phenix includes global detectors which provide information for event triggers as well as measurement of collision points along the beam axis and collision centralities .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the detector subsystems relevant for this analysis will be briefly explained below .",
    "charged particles are measured by a drift chamber  ( dc ) and two multi - wire chambers with pad readout  ( pc1 and pc3 ) located at 2.2 , 2.5 and 5  m from the beam axis in the east arm , respectively . the collision vertex points were measured using the time difference between two beam - beam counters  ( bbc ) located at z  @xmath0  + 144  cm  ( north side ) and z  @xmath0  -144  cm  ( south side ) from the nominal interaction point ( ip ) along the beam line , which cover pseudorapidity ranges of 3.0  @xmath69  @xmath32  @xmath69  3.9  ( north ) and -3.9  @xmath69  @xmath32  @xmath69  -3.0  ( south ) , respectively .",
    "each bbc has 64  @xmath72erenkov counter elements with the typical time resolution of 50  ps . combined with bbc s , two zero degree calorimeters  ( zdc ) were further used .",
    "the zdc s are designed to measure energies of spectator neutrons within a cone of 2  mrad around the beam axis .",
    "the two zdc s are located at z",
    "@xmath0  @xmath73  18.25  m from ip , respectively .",
    "the au+au minimum bias trigger and collision centralities were provided by combining information from both bbc s and zdc s .",
    "we have used data taken in au+au collisions at @xmath74  @xmath0  200  gev with the magnetic field off condition during rhic run-2 in  2002 , in order to optimize acceptance for the low @xmath12 charged particles .",
    "the basic trigger required coincident hits in the two bbc s ( equal or more than two hit @xmath72erenkov elements in each side ) and the two zdc s ( equal or more than one neutron in each side ) .",
    "the efficiency of this minimum - bias trigger is estimated as 92.2@xmath75% to the total au+au inelastic cross section by the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation based on the glauber model  @xcite .",
    "events with collision points within @xmath73  5  cm from the nominal ip as measured by the bbc were analyzed . in total ,",
    "258k events taken by the minimum - bias trigger were used in this analysis .",
    "we have rigorously checked the detector stability by looking at multiplicity correlations between the relevant sub - detector systems , as well as by monitoring positions of inefficient areas over the span of the analyzed dataset .",
    "we allowed 2% fluctuation on the average multiplcity of measured number of charged tracks in entire analyzed run ranges .          in this analysis , charged tracks detected in the east arm ( @xmath68  @xmath69  0.35 , @xmath70  @xmath69  @xmath71 ) were used .",
    "as charged track selection criteria , we required that each straight - line track reconstructed by a dc hit pattern associated with a pc1 hit be aligned with a pc3 hit and the collision vertex point measured by bbc .",
    "we required associations between dc tracks and pc3 hits to be within 10  cm in the distance of closest approach  ( dca ) , which was determined to minimize the random associations .",
    "the dc has six types of wire modules ; two of them are used for the track reconstruction for the azimuthal angle and others are used for the pattern recognition .",
    "selected tracks were reconstructed by using all wire modules of dc .",
    "in addition to the single track selection , we required a minimum two - track separation in order to minimize effects from fake tracks and associated secondary particles .",
    "when we find tracks within the minimum separation window of @xmath35  @xmath69  0.001 and @xmath76  @xmath69  0.012  rad , we count them as one track independent of the number of reconstructed tracks in the window . these cut values were determined by looking at @xmath35 and @xmath76 distributions on the @xmath77 plane of any two track pairs in the real data sample .",
    "the dc track resolution of 2  mm in the @xmath24 direction at a reference radius of 220  cm from the beam axis corresponds to 1.0  @xmath78  @xmath79 in @xmath32 .",
    "pc1 and pc3 , which are used for the track association , have the same solid angle each other , and these pixel sizes are 8.4  mm and 14.7  mm , respectively . these pixel sizes are greater than the requirement of two - track separation cuts , however , these resolutions are 1.7  mm and 3.6  mm for pc1 and pc3 respectively in z direction , and these values also corresponds to 1.0  @xmath78  @xmath79 in @xmath32 .",
    "the resolution in @xmath80 is 1  mrad , but the maximum drift length in dc corresponds to 0.012  rad .",
    "therefore the two - track separation window size in @xmath32 and @xmath80 is consistent with what is expected .    in the case of normal magnetic field condition at the phenix detector , which is used to identify the charged particles ,",
    "the threshold transverse momenta @xmath12 correspond to 0.2  gev/@xmath81 , 0.4  gev/@xmath81 and 0.6  gev/@xmath81 for charged pions @xmath82 , charged kaons @xmath83 and protons @xmath84(antiprotons @xmath85 ) , respectively  @xcite . since",
    "this analysis used the data taken without magnetic field , the threshold transverse momenta @xmath12 can be lowered to 0.1  gev/@xmath81 , 0.25  gev/@xmath81 and 0.35  gev/@xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84(@xmath85 ) , respectively .",
    "they were estimated by the geant - based monte carlo ( mc )  @xcite simulation by requiring the equivalent single track selection criteria .",
    "the average transverse momentum @xmath12 for the detected inclusive charged particles used in this analysis corresponds to 0.57  gev/@xmath81 , which was also estimated by using the measured @xmath12 spectra  @xcite with the mc simulation .",
    "therefore , the difference of the rapidity and pseudorapidity is at most 3% at the edge of the phenix acceptance .",
    "the collision centrality was determined by looking the correlation between a deposited charge sum in both north and south bbc s and an energy sum in both zdc s on an event - by - event basis . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : centdef ] , the centrality percentile is defined as the fraction of the number of events in a selected centrality bin on the correlation plot to the total number of minimum bias events , corrected for the min - bias trigger efficiency .",

    ", we adopt 5% centrality bin width from 0  -  5%(central ) to 60  -  65%(peripheral ) as indicated in the figure .",
    "the lower limit of 65% is indicated by the solid line in the figure . in the following analysis , as control samples , we also adopt 10% bin width by merging two 5% bin width samples from 0  -  10% to 50  -  60% and from 5  -  15% to 55  -  65% .",
