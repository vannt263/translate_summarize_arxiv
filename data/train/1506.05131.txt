    "identifying the origin of the dynamical evolution of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) outflows is an unsolved issue , critical to the understanding of both the energetics and spectra of these events .",
    "one idea is that the emission is the result of synchrotron radiation from an external forward shock propagating into the external circumburst medium ( cbm ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism should produce smooth @xmath0-ray pulses with durations on the order of a few seconds for typical grb parameters .",
    "however , the short - time variability ( on the order of a few milliseconds ) of many grb light curves ruled out this postulate as a universal mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gave favor to several alternative hypotheses including models that consist of rapid internal shocks in an unsteady outflow @xcite or magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to account for the observed emission .",
    "still , there do exist long and temporally smooth grbs with typical variability time scales larger than a few seconds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that do not violate the variability constraints of the external shock model and can be tested via their spectral evolution as to whether they conform to the well - established predictions made by this model .",
    "the simplicity of the model affords it the ability to be tested both spectrally and temporally , a feature unique to the external shock model .",
    "the dynamics and spectra of the internal shock model have been simulated @xcite , but the dynamics rely on assumed and degenerate configurations from variations in the wind ( e.g. the radial distribution of the lorentz factors ) , forbidding the formulation of unique predictions that can be identified in the data .",
    "therefore , it is currently impossible to test the internal shock model in the manner presented here without severe degeneracies . additionally , the internal shock model has trouble efficiently converting the internal kinetic energy of a grb into radiation , which is challenging when trying to explain the extreme luminosities observed @xcite .",
    "herein , we analyze the bright , long , single - pulsed grb  _ 141028a _ and find several clues for an external shock origin of its emission .",
    "we fit the grb s time - resolved spectra with a slow - cooled synchrotron+blackbody model @xcite and examine the evolution of the spectra .",
    "the evolution of the synchrotron @xmath1 peak ( @xmath2 ) is fit with an analytic physical model predicted by @xcite . from this fit",
    ", we obtain physical parameters such as the coasting lorentz factor and cbm radial profile which can then be used to predict how the flux of the prompt emission should evolve .",
    "comparing these predictions to the data enables us to test the validity of the model in several ways .",
    "the article is organized in the following manner . in section [ sec : esm ] , we introduce the formalism of the external shock model to derive a function for @xmath3 to fit to data . in section [ sec : analysis ] , the observations and spectral analysis are introduced . section [ sec : esa ] details our application of the external shock model to the data .",
    "the parameters resulting from the analysis are used to make further predictions regarding the flux evolution of the prompt phase of the grb .",
    "from there , we analyze the photospheric emission . in sections [ sec : afterglow ] and [ sec : lat ] , we discuss the compatibility of our results with the high and low - energy late - time observations .",
    "the external shock model is built upon the blast - wave evolution derived in @xcite which tracks the evolution of a relativistically expanding fireball into an external medium .",
    "the equations can be applied to grbs by assuming some fraction of the electrons in the shocked external medium is accelerated to high energies by the shock wave and radiates a fraction of the kinetic energy away via synchrotron radiation @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the analytic formalism developed in @xcite to fit the spectral evolution of the emission .",
    "we briefly review the main equations required and refer the reader to @xcite for more details on the model .",
    "the blast - wave is assumed to expand into an external circumburst medium ( cbm ) with a radial density evolution modeled as a power law ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the initial density and @xmath6 describes the radial morphology of the cbm such that @xmath7 is a constant density and @xmath8 describes a stellar wind .",
    "the dimensionless radial coordinate is @xmath9 where , following the convention that a quantity @xmath10 ,    @xmath11^{\\nicefrac{1}{3}}\\ ; { \\rm cm}\\ ] ]    is the radius at which the blast has swept up a significant amount of mass ( @xmath12 ) to begin decelerating @xcite .",
    "following the solution of @xcite the evolution of the bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath13 ) of the blast - wave is modeled as a broken power law consisting of a coasting phase followed by a deceleration phase :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the coasting lorentz factor and @xmath16 is the radiative regime index . for a constant density ( @xmath7 ) cbm , @xmath17 indicate the fully radiative and non - radiative ( adiabatic ) expansion regimes respectively @xcite .",
    "a fraction of the blast energy is dissipated in the shock and accelerates electrons to high energies , which subsequently radiate this away via synchrotron radiation . following the parameterization of @xcite ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the @xmath1 peak energy , @xmath2 , of this synchrotron radiation can be modeled as    @xmath18 ^ 4 x^{-\\nicefrac{\\eta}{2 } } \\ ; { \\rm kev}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the observed @xmath2 at the observed deceleration time , @xmath20    here , @xmath21 is the speed of light and @xmath22 parameterizes the magnetic field and shock acceleration microphysics such that @xmath23^{\\nicefrac{1}{2 } } \\epsilon_{\\rm e}^2 $ ] . here",

    ", we will allow values @xmath31 to cover the range of typically assumed values .",
    "additionally , we can write the measured @xmath1 peak luminosity as @xmath32 where @xmath33    here , @xmath34 is the proton mass and @xmath35 is the blast - wave area factor .",
    "the proportionality in equation  [ eq : p0 ] comes from the fact that in @xcite an empirical photon model is used to create light curves and here we will be using synchrotron emission directly to fit the time - resolved spectra of grb  _ 141028a _ ( see section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .    with these equations , the external shock model can predict several observable quantities , namely , the evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath36 which we test below in section [ sec : eppp ] .",
    "the effects on the @xmath2 evolution of different parameters is shown in figure  [ fig : demo ] .",
    "the parameters have the following dominant effects :    * @xmath15 : sets the break time * @xmath6 : sets the slope of early @xmath2 decay * @xmath16 : sets the slope of late @xmath2 decay .     with time .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath15 has the strongest effect on the timescale of the burst , while @xmath6 affects the early evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath16 the late evolution . ]",
    "these parameters , along with @xmath22 which acts as a normalization , will be the free parameters that will be determined by fitting the observed evolution of @xmath2 to equation  [ eq : ep ] . in reality , the range of values for @xmath16 are determined by the value of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "since we can not know a priori the value of @xmath6 , we treat @xmath16 as an independent parameter .",
    "it is important to note that this analytic approximation to the blast - wave evolution fails to capture some aspects that the full numerical solution exhibits @xcite .",
    "most notable is the smooth transition from coasting to decelerating at the deceleration radius ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the formalism we adopt will serve as a proof of concept that will be further applied to a larger sample and improved upon with a full numerical treatment .",
    "rapid variability poses a problem for the external shock model ; therefore , bright , long , single - pulsed grbs provide the most viable candidates for being produced by external shocks .",
    "grb  _ 141028a _ is an example of this class of grb ( see figure  [ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "grb  _ 141028a _ was discovered by the _ fermi _",
    "gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) @xcite and the bright grb triggered an autonomous repoint of the _ fermi _ spacecraft to optimize the large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite for follow - up observations . in ground analysis ,",
    "lat also localized and detected the grb @xcite until @xmath38 s after the trigger .",
    "the localization led to a target of opportunity observation by the narrow - field _ swift _ instruments ( the x - ray telescope , xrt ; and the ultraviolet optical telescope , uvot ) @xcite . the x - ray and optical afterglow",
    "was detected by xrt @xcite and uvot @xcite , and subsequently by many different ground - based facilities , including a measurement of a redshift of z=2.332 with the very large telescope / x - shooter instrument @xcite .",
    "we collected optical / nir photometry from gcn circulars , and constructed a multi - band sed using grond data @xcite , and light curves using r and i filters ( grond , ratir : @xcite , p60 : @xcite , lcogtn : @xcite ) .",
    "the xrt light curve and spectra were obtained from the xrt team repository @xcite .",
    "we triggered a pre - approved late - time chandra target of opportunity observation to constrain the properties of the break in the x - ray afterglow hinted at by xrt .",
    "the 40 ks chandra observation was analyzed with ciao v4.6 , yielding a faint detection which was converted to flux using the fit to the xrt spectrum .",
    "the x - ray and optical afterglow observations began at @xmath39 s after the gbm trigger .",
    "it is therefore impossible to observe the continuous evolution of the flux from the prompt to afterglow phase at low - energy .          for the prompt emission ,",
    "we use gbm time - tagged event ( tte ) data and @xmath40 lat low - energy ( lle ) data to perform spectral analysis .",
    "the lle technique is an analysis method designed to study bright transient phenomena in the 30 mev - 1 gev energy range , and was successfully applied to _",
    "fermi_-lat grbs @xcite and solar flares @xcite .",
    "the idea behind lle is to maximize the effective area below @xmath41 1 gev by relaxing the standard analysis requirement on background rejection .",
    "the first five seconds after the trigger time are excluded because the count rate was too low to constrain a spectral model .    using the method of @xcite",
    ", we calculated the variability components of grb  _ 141028a _ during the prompt emission .",
    "we find the dominant component to be @xmath42  s and an insignificant fast component with @xmath43  s. these values place the burst safely within the range of what can be expected by an external shock .",
    "we use time bins of 1 s to be sure to bin below the fast variability component . to fit the time - resolved spectra",
    ", we employ a two - component model consisting of synchrotron emission from an incompletely cooled electron distribution ( slow - cooled ) and a blackbody @xcite ( see figure [ fig : spectrum ] ) . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that single pulsed grbs have spectra that are compatible with slow - cooled synchrotron sometimes with and sometimes without the addition of a blackbody .",
    "this motivates our choice of the synchrotron+blackbody photon model for fitting the spectra of the grb  _",
    "141028a_. we note that not all grb spectra are compatible with this photon model .",
    "there exist grbs such as grb  _ 090902b _ with a clear dominant photospheric component originating from subphotospheric dissipation @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron model implemented is fully physical in the sense that the spectral shape comes from the synchrotron emissivity and electron distribution alone .",
    "the spectral fitting _ should not _ be confused with fitting the empirical band function @xcite with its variable low - energy index ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the blackbody is only included in time bins that statistically require it via a likelihood ratio test .",
    "we find that this statistical requirement produces a continuous presence of the blackbody for the first part of the observation .",
    "the data are well fit by the two - component model ( see table [ tab : gbmanal ] for a summary of the spectral fits ) and we observe two key features that motivate our investigation of the grb under the framework of the external shock model : @xmath2 evolves as a broken power law in time and the blackbody is only significant for a duration of @xmath4110 seconds compared to the total prompt duration of @xmath4125  s ( see section  [ sec : photosphere ] ) .",

    "the exact time of the break is unconstrained but it ranges from @xmath206 . identifying the break as a jet break , the jet opening angle can be estimated to be @xcite        @xmath207    where @xmath208 is the break time in days and @xmath209 is the radiative efficiency taken to be 0.1 corresponding to our assumption of @xmath210 erg .",
    "thus , the opening angle ranges from @xmath211 , when considering the fitted parameters obtained in section [ sec : epevo ] .",

    "the spectrum is consistent with a single power - law of index @xmath225 .",
    "therefore , we can deduce that the cooling frequency is above the xrt frequency : @xmath226 . from the expansion of a blast - wave in a constant density cbm",
    ", @xmath227 can be estimated as @xcite    @xmath228    where @xmath24 parameterizes the magnetic field in the shocked ism , @xmath229 is the time in days and @xmath230 is the compton parameter , that we chose to be zero for simplicity .",
    "this leads to an upper limit @xmath231 taking @xmath232 day and assuming @xmath233 and @xmath234 which implies @xmath235 ( see however , table [ tab : eb ] for values corresponding to different parameter choices ) .    also , this value can be cross - checked by considering the peak energy in the first seconds of the prompt phase , which can be evaluated as :    @xmath236    where @xmath237 is the critical magnetic field , @xmath238 parameterizes the minimum lorentz factor @xmath183 of the accelerated electrons such that @xmath239 , @xmath240 is the mass of an electron , and @xmath2 is given in units of the mass of an electron . using @xmath241 mev and @xmath150 as obtained from the data , and assuming @xmath242 gives @xmath243",
    "( see also table [ tab : eb ] ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the upper limit obtained from the late afterglow which is fairly unconstrained : as an example , with @xmath244 , it becomes @xmath245 , incompatible with the upper limit obtained from the afterglow . ] .",
    "finally , the cooling time of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath183 can be compared to the expansion time of the blast - wave at the observed luminosity peak which is on the order of the @xmath193 .",
    "we find that they are comparable , leading to efficient energy extraction from the electrons , without drastically changing the electron distribution function , _",
    "i.e. _ , creating an additional power law over several orders of magnitude at low - energy characteristic of fast - cooled ( or completely cooled ) electrons .",
    "@xmath40 lat observed a gev component over the duration of @xmath246 s. unfortunately , there were no simultaneous observations at other wavelengths from which a broadband spectrum could be obtained .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the analytic flux evolution derived in @xcite to check if the observed lat fluxes are compatible with the model .",
    "we must first address a few caveats : the analytic model assumes no synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission and the fluxes are sensitive to our lack of knowledge about the total burst energy ( which we assume to be @xmath247 erg for the purpose of calculation ) as well as the degeneracies in the recovered parameters from the @xmath2 evolution fit .    in the past years , a debate concerning the origin of the late time ( few seconds after the trigger ) high - energy lat emission has taken place , opposing a synchrotron mechanism @xcite , ssc @xcite , and pair - loading of the cbm @xcite as the possible candidates for this emission .",
    "first , we can assess the ssc component , and show that with the parameters at hand from the prompt emission the ssc flux in the lat bandpass is much less than the synchrotron flux .",
    "we can constrain the ssc flux in the lat bandpass by following the discussion in @xcite ( see appendix [ sec : ssccalc ] for further details ) . via equation",
    "[ eq : fracit2 ] , the ratio of ssc flux to synchrotron flux in the lat bandpass ( @xmath248 ) can be computed by substituting values derived in section [ sec : afterglow ] to yield @xmath249 .",
    "the numerical result shows that the ssc flux in the lat band is much less than the synchrotron flux .",
    "however , the computation _ relies _ on the assumption that electrons are fast cooled either by synchrotron or by inverse compton of the produced synchrotron photons , that is to say that all the energy is emitted by one or the other mechanism .",
    "it comes with two consequences :    1 .",
    "the compton parameter _ is _ an upper limit as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore the result of eq.([eq : fracit2 ] ) is only an upper limit , 2 .   as a result of the assumption of fast cooling",
    ", the electron distribution function extends to small lorentz factors .",
    "these electrons are not in the klein - nishina regime and can efficiently upscattered synchrotron photon in the lat band .",
    "however , we found that electrons with lorentz factor @xmath183 are not strongly cooled over a dynamical time .",
    "therefore the electron distribution function does not extend substantially below @xmath183 , reducing the inverse compton flux .",
    "we now consider that the gev emission is the result of synchrotron emission from the same forward - shock responsible for the lower energy prompt phase . using the analytic estimate for the blast - wave evolution , we estimate the expected flux of the synchrotron emitting blast - wave and compare it to the integrated ( 100 mev - 10 gev ) lat energy flux ( @xmath133 ) by integrating equation 1 from @xcite across the lat bandpass ( see figure [ fig : latflux ] ) . because of our lack of knowledge about the intrinsic total energy of the blast - wave and the degeneracies in the fit parameters ( @xmath22 , @xmath5 ) , we vary the parameters across a broad range and find that the model gives consistent limits within an order of magnitude .",
    "we also note that this model is simple and will not be as accurate as a full numerical solution .",
    "additionally , using the power - law electron index ( @xmath250 ) found from gbm+lle synchrotron fits , we compute the synchrotron photon indices via the transformation @xmath251 and compare them with the photon indices found in the lat alone ( figure [ fig : indx ] ) .",
    "there is a clear evolution of the synchrotron photon index increasing that smoothly transitions to the indices observed by the lat .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the high energy emission from the lat is compatible with synchrotron emission alone , and does not require an additional mechanism .",
    "it was proposed by @xcite , in which the prompt mev phase is assumed to be the result of an unspecified mechanism , that the gev lat emission arises from a separate exernal shock with a synchrotron peak on the order of a few 100 mev .",
    "conditions on the density and the magnetic field are then derived such that this external shock is not more luminous than the prompt emission in the sub - mev band . however , for grb  _ 141028a _ we show that the entire emission can be explained by synchrotron emission with an mev peak energy from a single forward shock without fine - tuning of the parameters , i.e. , both the mev and the delayed gev can be explained self - consistently by an external shock .      in this section ,",
    "we concisely summarize the novel approach we have employed to test the external shock model in the prompt phase .",
    "almost as important as the observed @xmath2 evolution is the fact that we can fit the spectrum with a physical slow - cooling synchrotron model .",
    "even though it is possible to fit a physical synchrotron model to the spectra ( as opposed to an empirical band function from which the comparison to physical models must be inferred and can lead to problems as shown in @xcite ) , it must be shown that the photon model is sound , i.e , that the dynamical evolution can lead to slow - cooling synchrotron emission . in section [ sec : afterglow ] , we confirmed that both the afterglow and prompt phase are consistent with slow - cooling emission .",
    "the evolution of @xmath2 in time can be fit with the analytic prediction of @xcite . while the blast - wave appears to be transitioning to the asymptotic limits , ( @xmath172 )",
    "we tentatively conclude that it is evolving towards an adiabatic regime .",
    "full temporal coverage of the flux and spectra through the late time evolution will help to resolve this issue .",
    "unfortunately , few single pulsed grbs have been observed with such a temporal and wavelength coverage .",
    "this unique opportunity presents itself only due to the current multi - mission capabilities and begs for continued multi - wavelength coverage .",
    "if we take the fitted parameters of the @xmath2 evolution fit , we can predict the evolution of the @xmath252 plane which is consistent with the data in both the rise and decay phase of the pulse .",
    "the hic of the prompt decay phase of the synchrotron luminosity is consistent with what would be expected from slow - cooling synchrotron in a decelerating external shock .",
    "we use the observation of the photospheric component to estimate both the width of the blast - wave as well as when the relativistic reverse shock crosses the forward shock . from our calculations",
    ", the reverse shock will have very little impact on the evolution of the forward shock and we therefore neglect it .",
    "in this article , we have shown that the prompt phase of grb  _ 141028a _ is consistent with originating from an external shock that emits synchrotron radiation from an electron distribution that did not have enough time to cool completely ( slow - cooled ) .",
    "combining the results of the @xmath2 evolution fits with the other clues from the data , an external shock origin of grb  _ 141028a _ is a very likely scenario . not only",
    "do we find that the prompt emission is explained by synchrotron emission from a forward shock , but we find clues for a late time high - energy emission resulting from the extension of this synchrotron emission rather than an ssc component .",
    "we want to stress that in this scenario the delineation between `` prompt '' and `` afterglow '' is superfluous as the early and late time emission both originate from the same mechanism .",
    "we are currently applying this analysis to other long , single pulse grbs and find that they too have their @xmath1 peak and @xmath175 which evolved consistently with the predictions of an external shock .",
    "these results will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we propose that external shocks are still a viable candidate to explain the prompt dynamics of grbs .",
    "however , the most likely scenario is that they are a subset of multiple dynamical frameworks including internal shocks that further subdivide into categories based on opacity and/or magnetic content of the outflow .",
    "we note that this is not an entirely new idea . @xcite",
    "numerically investigated the parameter space of the external shock model and proposed that smooth , single - pulsed ( and possibly multi - pulsed ) grbs can belong to a subclass of grbs that are the results of external shocks .",
    "we have now shown this quantitatively by applying the model to the data .",
    "the analysis of individual grbs is crucial to identifying what is likely a host of different emission mechanisms .",
    "for example , grb  _ 090902b _ exhibits dynamics and spectra that are consistent with subphotospheric dissipation @xcite .",
    "the fact that both external shocks and photospheric emission are observationally viable candidates for explaining grb emission implies that we should use caution when trying to apply one mechanism as an explanation for all grbs based of properties from catalogs and should instead focus on how to relate the different emission mechanisms into a unified framework .",
