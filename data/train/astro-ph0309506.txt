    "coronal euv emission is mainly produced by radiative decay of collisionally excited , highly - ionized iron ions , i.e. by fe@xmath11 and fe@xmath12 in the 171   trace passband ( @xmath13 mk ) and by fe@xmath14 at 195  ( @xmath15 mk ) .",
    "coronal loops undergo various phases of heating and cooling .",
    "when steady heating operates , the loops evolve into a steady - state , where heating input is balanced by thermal conduction losses to the chromosphere and radiative losses into space , as described by the energy equation derived by rosner , tucker , & vaiana ( 1978 ) , generalized for gravity and non - uniform heating by serio et al .",
    "( 1981 ) . when heating stops , coronal loops cool off by thermal conduction and radiative losses .",
    "one consequence of this cooling process is that the euv emission peaks first in a high - temperature filter 1 , e.g. in trace 195 , and later in a lower - temperature filter 2 , e.g. in trace 171  , with a time delay that we call _ cooling delay _ @xmath2 .",
    "this cooling delay was found to scale proportionally to the loop length @xmath16 in a recent study ( winebarger et al .",
    "2003 ) . under the assumption that the cooling time is dominated by radiative cooling",
    ", we can relate this observable time delay to the radiative loss function @xmath17 , which allows us to constrain the absolute abundances of iron ions , which dominates the radiative loss function in this coronal temperature range of @xmath18 mk .",
    "the new method of determining iron abundances provides an important diagnostic for coronal heating mechanisms that involve preferential ion heating .",
    "this study demonstrates also that much more physical information can be inferred from the temporal evolution of the euv intensity than from the intensity measured in a single image .",
    "plasma cooling through a narrow temperature range can be approximated by an exponential function , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the initial temperature at time @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the cooling time . cooling over large temperature ranges",
    "would require the full consideration of the hydrodynamic equations , but the exponential approximation is fully justified for the narrow temperature range of @xmath23 mk we are considering here , during the cooling of coronal flare loops through the two trace 171 and 195  filters ( see also measurements in warren et al .",
    "so , when a cooling plasma reaches the temperature @xmath20 of the peak response of the hotter filter ( @xmath24 mk for trace 195 ) , the time delay @xmath2 to cool down to the cooler filter @xmath25 ( e.g. @xmath26 mk for 171 trace ) , can be expressed with eq.1 as @xmath27 the cooling time scale could be dominated by thermal conduction losses in the initial phase , but is always dominated by radiative losses in the later phase ( e.g. , antiochos & sturrock 1982 ) . here",
    "we make the a priori assumption that the cooling of euv loops in the @xmath28 mk temperature range is dominated by radiative losses .",
    "this working hypothesis is particularly justified near the almost isothermal loop tops and is also corroborated by the observational result found in aschwanden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , where a median value of @xmath29 was obtained from the statistics of 12 nanoflare loops observed with trace 171 and 195 .",
    "moreover we show later that the radiative cooling time is always significantly shorter than the conductive cooling time for the cases analyzed here .",
    "thus we set the cooling time @xmath22 equal to the radiative cooling time @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electron density , @xmath33 the hydrogen density , @xmath34 the electron temperature , @xmath35 erg k@xmath36 the boltzmann constant , @xmath37 the abundance enhancement factor for low _ first - ionization potential _ elements ( at @xmath38 kev ) , and @xmath39 the radiative loss function , which can be approximated with a constant in the limited temperature range of @xmath40 mk , according to the piece - wise powerlaw approximation of rosner et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , @xmath41 , for t=0.5 - 2.0 mk .",
    "the computation of the radiative loss function at a given temperature depends on the elemental atomic abundances , and thus we define a reference value @xmath42 for photospheric abundances .",
    "coronal abundances generally show a density enhancement for low first - ionization potential ( fip ) elements , which we express with an enhancement factor @xmath37 . since iron ( fe ) contribution strongly at these temperatures , the radiative loss function in the corona scales as @xmath43",
    "the cooling delay @xmath2 as function of the coronal iron abundance @xmath44 is thus ( with eqs .  1 - 3 )",
    ", assuming full ionization in the corona ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 when a loop cools through a passband , the maximum of the flux @xmath47 is detected at the time when the loop temperature matches the peak of the response function , so the peak flux @xmath3 of the light curve in the lower filter corresponds to the emission measure @xmath48 at the filter temperature @xmath25 , @xmath49 with the flux @xmath3 in units of dn/(pixel s ) , @xmath4 is the loop width or diameter , @xmath50 is the linear filling factor in case of unresolved substructures , and @xmath51 is the response function , which is @xmath52 @xmath53 dn/(pixel s ) for 171  and photospheric abundances ( see appendix a in aschwanden et al .",
    "the value @xmath51 of the response function refers to the time at the beginning of the mission , while the degradation decreased this value by a factor of 0.78 in august 1999 , the latest date of analyzed observations used here .",
    "the corresponding correction by a factor of @xmath54 is neglected in the numerical values given in table 1 . inserting the density from eq.(5 ) into eq.(4 )",
    "we find the following expression for the iron abundance @xmath44 , @xmath55 for a filling factor of unity ( @xmath56 ) , the iron enhancement factor can be determined with an accurcay of about @xmath57% , because the observables @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 can each be measured better than @xmath58% . in case of unresolved fine structure ,",
    "i.e. filling factors of @xmath59 , we obtain with eq.(6 ) an upper limit for the iron enhancement .",
    "recent euv observations with trace have shown that the cooling delay @xmath2 is roughly proportional to the loop length @xmath16 . in order to understand such a correlation we use the energy balance equation , which is valid in a steady - state , e.g. , before the cooling process , at the turning point from dominant heating to dominant cooling , or at the turning point from dominant conductive cooling to radiative cooling .",
    "the resulting scaling law is according to rosner et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , @xmath60 with @xmath61 the pressure and @xmath16 the loop half length .",
    "this scaling law has been generalized for gravity and non - uniform heating by serio et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , modified by the correction factor @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the heating scale length and @xmath64 km the pressure scale height . with the ideal gas law ( @xmath65 ) , corrected for the pressure at the loop top [ @xmath66 , we can eliminate the pressure @xmath67 in the rtv scaling law and find the following expression for the density @xmath32 , @xmath68 inserting this density into the relation for the cooling delay ( eq .  4 ) we find indeed a proportional relation @xmath0 , @xmath69 \\ .\\ ] ] which should show up for cooling loops with similar maximum temperatures @xmath70 .",
    "the relation @xmath71 was also derived in cargill et al .",

    "we are using three data sets for which the cooling delay between the trace 195  and 171  filters has been measured : 11 nanoflare loops analyzed in aschwanden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , 4 medium - sized euv loops analyzed in schrijver ( 2002 ) , and 5 large euv loops analyzed in winebarger at al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    in the first study ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2000 ) , nanoflare loops were measured on 1999 febr 17 , 02:15 - 03:00 ut , with a cadence of @xmath72 min in both 171  and 195  with trace .",
    "the time delay between the appearance in the two filters was measured by cross - correlation of the two time profiles , shown in fig.6 and listed in table 1 of aschwanden et al .",
    "the time delay was found to be positive in 11 out of 12 cases .",
    "we use only the 11 cases with positive time delay , sorted according to the loop length in table 1 .",
    "the loop length was determined from a geometric model of a projected semi - circular cylindrical loop .",
    "the electron density @xmath32 is measured from the flux @xmath3 and loop width @xmath4 according to eq.(5 ) .    in the second study ( schrijver 2001 ) ,",
    "time delays between the maximum intensity in the 171 and 195  trace passbands were measured in 4 active region loops observed above the limb on 2000 may 26 .",
    "the loop half length was estimated with @xmath73 based on the height @xmath74 of the loop top above the limb and a height correction @xmath75 mm for the offset between optical limb and the portion of the plage inside the limb .",
    "the fluxes @xmath76 and loop widths @xmath4 could not be reliably measured for this subset , because of confusion problems in the crowded limb regions .    in the third study ( winebarger et al .",
    "2002 ) , 5 loops were measured on 1999 aug 18 , 1998 jul 04 , 1998 jul 25 , 1998 aug 17 , and 1998 jul 25 , in both the 171 and 195  filters with trace .",
    "the time delay between the two filters was measured from the peak times of asymmetric gaussian curves fitted to the light curves in the two filters .",
    "the loop lengths were measured from the best fit of elliptical and dipolar geometric models to the projected loop shapes .    inserting the measured values @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath4 , and @xmath2 into eq.(6 ) yields the iron abundance enhancement factors @xmath44 listed in table 1 , which have a mean and standard deviation of @xmath77 for the dataset of aschwanden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and @xmath78 for the dataset of winebarger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , respectively .",
    "note that the mean iron enhancement is significantly higher for the small - scale nanoflares analyzed in aschwanden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) than for the large - scale loops of winebarger et al .",
    "the variable degree of iron enhancement could be related to different physical conditions in freshly - filled small - scale loops compared with longer - lived large - scale loops .",
    "the effect of gravitational settling has been observed in observations of coronal streamers with sumer ( feldman et al .",
    "1999 ) and with uvcs ( raymond et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath44 have to be considered as upper limits if the filling factor @xmath5 is lower than unity",
    ". we can turn the argument around and assume that the iron abundance enhancement has to be larger than or equal unity , which would then constitute lower limits for the filling factors : @xmath79 ( aschwanden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and @xmath80 ( winebarger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the correlation plot between the cooling delay @xmath81 and the loop half length @xmath16 .",
    "a linear regression fit between the logarithic values yields the power - law relation @xmath82 which is fully consistent with the theoretical prediction of a linear relationship @xmath83 ( eq .",
    "10 ) .    in order to verify our initial assumption of dominant radiative loss",
    ", we estimate also the conductive cooling time , @xmath84 where we assign a mean value of @xmath85 mk for the looptop temperature , when the loop cools through the two trace passbands .",
    "the last two columns in table 1 show that the conductive cooling time is always much larger than the radiative cooling time , @xmath86 , which corroborates our a priori assumption of dominant radiative cooling .",
    "we have developed a simple method to constrain the iron abundance or filling factor in a coronal loop , based on the cooling delay measurement between two euv filters .",
    "this model predicts a linear relationship between the cooling delay and the loop length , i.e. @xmath87 , which is consistent with the observed relation , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "the only underlying assumption is that the cooling is dominated by radiative loss in the temperature range of euv loops ( @xmath8 mk here ) , rather than by conductive loss .",
    "theoretical models of cooling in flare loops predict that conductive cooling is only dominant in the initial phase of very hot plasma seen in soft x - rays , say at @xmath88 mk , while the later cooling phase seen in euv is dominanted by radiative cooling ( antiochos 1980 ; antiochos & sturrock 1982 ; cargill et al .",
    "our measurements of the density allows us to estimate upper limits for the radiative cooling time .",
    "if there would be a filling factor @xmath59 , the density would be higher and the radiative cooling time shorter .",
    "but even for a filling factor of unity , we find that the radiative cooling time in the euv temperature range is significantly shorter than the conductive cooling time , which corroborates our a priori assumption .",
    "this is also consistent with other observations of euv loops , where the ratio of the cooling time to the radiative cooling time was found to be @xmath29 ( aschwanden et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the main result of this study is the estimation of the iron abundance .",
    "we show a compilation of radiative loss functions in fig .  2 , which has been calculated for photospheric abundances ( meyer 1985 ) , with an absolute iron abundance of @xmath89 relative to hydrogen @xmath90 ( i.e. @xmath91 ) , as well as for coronal abundances ( feldman 1992 ) , which have an iron enhancement by a factor of @xmath92 .",
    "this enhancement factor of @xmath92 in density produces a change of the radiative loss rate that can be seen between the two curves calculated by martens et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in fig .  2 , at a temperature of @xmath13 mk .",
    "recent measurements of the absolute abundance of iron based on comparisons or euv and radio data yielded a value of @xmath93 , or a coronal iron enhancement by a factor of @xmath94 ( white et al .",
    "our measurements from 16 different loops in many different active regions yield a median value of @xmath95 , or a mean and standard deviation of @xmath96 . because of this reasonable agreement of iron enhancements with radio methods ( white et al .",
    "2000 ) and spectroscopic measurements ( feldman 1992 ) , our result corroborates the notion that low - fip elements such as fe are enhanced in the corona relative to photospheric values ( feldman 1992 ) . by the same token we can argue the filling factor is close to unity in coronal euv loops , otherwise we would have disagreement with spectroscopic and radio iron abundance measurements .",
