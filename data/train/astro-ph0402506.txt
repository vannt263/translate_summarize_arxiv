    "historically , attempts at interpreting the observed variability behavior of the broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have tended to regard the broad emission line region ( blr ) as a stationary entity ( non - evolving ) . by this",
    "we mean that any variability in the observed emission - line intensities has been attributed solely to reverberation ( light - travel - time ) effects within a spatially extended blr .",
    "thus , variations in the measured blr sizes and the amplitude of the line response have been assumed to arise primarily through differences in the temporal variability of the ionizing continuum , which manifests as a difference in shape and fwhm of the continuum autocorrelation function ( acf ) from one event to the next ( e.g. , prez , robinson , & de  la  fuenta 1992 ) .",
    "in essence , higher frequency continuum variations are better able to probe smaller blr sizes , while larger blr sizes are better probed by lower frequency continuum variations .    while a difference in the continuum variability time scale ( e.g.",
    ", the width of the continuum acf ) explains in part some of the observed variability seen in the broad emission lines in agns , it is by no means the complete picture .",
    "indeed , more sophisticated photoionization calculations ( e.g. , see krolik et  al .",
    "1991 ; obrien et  al .",
    "1995 ; bottorff et  al .  1997 ;",
    "kaspi & netzer 1999 ; horne , korista , & goad 2003 ) have modeled the line variability by including the local emission - line response to changes in the overall luminosity and/or shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "the models presented by carroll ( 1985 ) and netzer ( 1991 ) anticipated the non - linear response of some of the emission lines .    in this paper",
    "we illustrate , using a general description of the blr , how large changes in the mean continuum level may explain much of the observed variability behavior of the optical recombination lines . in @xmath4",
    "2 we describe the grid of photoionization models used in this study . in @xmath4",
    "3 we describe the physical origin of line responsivity and its impact on the following issues related to blr variability : the origin and slope of the intrinsic baldwin effect ( @xmath4  3.2 ; e.g. , kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 ) ; variations in the measured continuum  emission - line time - delays ( @xmath4  3.3 ; e.g. , peterson et  al .",
    "2002 ) , variations in the emission line flux ratios ( @xmath4  3.4 ; e.g. , balmer decrement : tran , osterbrock , & martel 1992 ; h@xmath2/  4686 : peterson & ferland 1986 ) ; changes in profile shape ( @xmath4  3.5 ; e.g. , wanders & peterson 1996 ) ; and velocity - dependent line intensity ratios ( @xmath4  3.6 ; e.g. , stirpe , de  bruyn , & van  groningen 1988 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the variations in these quantities discussed here are _ not _ a consequence of reverberation effects within a finite - sized blr , although they are intimately related .",
    "rather , they are due to global changes in the mean ionization state of the blr gas . in @xmath4  4",
    "we discuss the impact of these findings on the purported contribution of a very broad optically thin component to the emission - line response , and other related issues .",
    "it is our hope that many of these observed emission - line variations and trends reported in the literature may be examined in a new light .",
    "we summarize our main findings in @xmath4  5 .",
    "for the purposes of demonstration , we adopted the grid of photoionization computations presented in korista & goad ( 2000 ; hereafter kg00 ) that they used to model the strong uv broad emission lines of ngc  5548 .",
    "the reader is directed there for details ; here we mention some of the salient features of their grid and adopted model .    using ferland s spectral synthesis code , cloudy ( v90.04 ;",
    "ferland 1997 ; ferland et  al .",
    "1998 ) , kg00 generated a grid of 3249 photoionization models of broad line - emitting entities , here assumed to be simple , single total hydrogen column density slabs ( @xmath5 ) , each of which has constant gas density ( for simplicity ) and a clear view to the source of ionizing photons .",
    "the grid dimensions spanned 7 orders of magnitude in total hydrogen gas number density , @xmath6 , and hydrogen - ionizing photon flux , @xmath7 , and stepped in 0.125 decade intervals in each dimension .",
    "we refer to the plane defined by these two parameters as the density - flux plane .",
    "the choice of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is described in kg00 ( see also figure  a1 in horne , korista , & goad 2003 ) . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of the results presented here to these and other assumptions .    in the top four panels of figure  1 we show the equivalent width ( ew ) distributions of the prominent optical broad emission lines of h@xmath3 @xmath06563 , h@xmath2 @xmath04861 , @xmath05876 , and @xmath04686 , namely , those of primary interest in the present paper .",
    "these ews are all referenced to the same incident continuum flux at 1215   and _ are a measure of the efficiency by which ionizing continuum photons are converted into line photons_. the peak in the ew distribution for each line is denoted by a triangle .",
    "note that the ews of the balmer and lines increase with increasing density , especially at the lower values of the photon flux , illustrating the effects of collisional excitation from excited states ( ferland & netzer 1979 ) . in every case ,",
    "the line ews decline in the direction of increasing ionizing photon flux for values greater than those marking the peak ews : @xmath8 , 18.250 , 19.125 , and 20.750 for h@xmath3 , h@xmath2 , , and , respectively .",
    "the rapid decline in the line ews of the two balmer lines for @xmath9 is due to the hydrogen in the fixed ",
    "column density slabs becoming fully ionized , a subject we discuss later .",
    "the two helium lines do likewise at slightly larger values of @xmath10 .",
    "the upper left corners of these diagrams represent gas near the compton temperature .",
    "detailed discussions of these and other ew contour plots in the density - flux plane can be found in korista et  al.(1997 ) . in order to aid in comparison and to serve as a fixed point of reference ,",
    "the star symbol in each of the panels shows the location of the standard blr parameters from davidson & netzer ( 1979 ) .",

    "] , are plotted in the bottom panels of figure  1 .",
    "we refer to them from time to time for purposes of comparison .      to model the mean uv spectrum of ngc  5548 from the 1993 _ hst _ campaign ( korista et  al .",
    "1995 ; hereafter k95 ) kg00 took the `` locally optimally - emitting clouds '' ( loc ) approach of baldwin et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) by summing the emission from a weighted distribution of `` clouds '' along the two dimensions of gas density and radius ; kg00 assumed constant column density clouds of @xmath12  @xmath13 .",
    "the cloud distribution functions in gas density and radius are described in kg00 . in brief , the model - integrated spectra included clouds spherically distributed around the continuum source whose gas densities  cm . ] and distances from the central source of ionizing photons spanned @xmath14 and 1140 lt - days ; very highly ionized clouds ( @xmath15 ) were excluded from the integration ( see kg00 for details ) .",
    "asymmetric geometric effects , such as emission - line anisotropy ( ferland et  al.1992 ; obrien et  al .",
    "1994 ) , were not considered .",
    "kg00 showed that this simple model with widely distributed cloud properties was also generally successful in reproducing the observed uv broad emission - line variability .    with the choice of cosmological parameters and",
    "adopted galactic reddening along the line of sight to ngc  5548 from kg00 , the mean value of @xmath16 continuum flux from the 1993 _ hst _ campaign ( k95 ) corresponds to @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "using the central continuum sed adopted by kg00 , the corresponding mean hydrogen - ionizing luminosity from the 1993 _ hst _ campaign is @xmath19 . at this luminosity",
    "a hydrogen - ionizing photon flux @xmath20 corresponds to a distance from the continuum source of @xmath21 lt - days , and the model blr spans @xmath22 to @xmath23 in this mean continuum state . in this paper",
    "we consider two historical extrema in the @xmath16 continuum flux of ngc  5548 about the above mean level . in 1992 ,",
    "the continuum went into a very low state , @xmath24 , while a high state of @xmath25 was recorded during the 1989 campaign .",
    "this is a factor of about 8.2 change in the continuum flux at 1350   , and we assumed that the sed did not change shape .",
    "while we do present results based on a simple loc model of the blr in ngc  5548 , they should be representative of most general classes of models describing the broad emission lines .",
    "the major trends should be largely model - independent , while the details should be diagnostic of the physical conditions within individual blrs .",
    "summing the line emission along the cloud gas density distribution at each radius , we can derive an effective cloud surface flux of the emission lines at that radius ( see kg00 ; baldwin et al .",
    "figure  2 shows the surface flux of h@xmath2 as a function of radius from the central continuum source for each of the two continuum states .",
    "the slope of cloud emission - line surface flux plotted against the ionizing flux ( @xmath26 ) is a measure of the effective radial responsivity of the emitting gas for small amplitude ( or equivalently , short time scale ) changes in the ionizing continuum ( see goad et  al .",
    "similarly , the difference in the two surface flux curves plotted in figure  2 ( in @xmath27 space ) relative to the logarithm of the factor of 8.2 in the incident continuum flux measures a `` global '' response to long - term , large amplitude , changes in the continuum state .",
    "we define this responsivity parameter as @xmath28 this definition of line responsivity converges to the definition given in goad et  al.(1993 ) for very small variations in the continuum flux .",
    "note that the upper curve in figure  2 is essentially the lower curve shifted along the x - axis by @xmath29 decades .",
    "a logarithmic slope of @xmath30 in figure  2 corresponds to @xmath31 , whereas flatter slopes correspond to @xmath32 . when integrated over the full line - emitting region , what we call the effective responsivity , @xmath33 , is the logarithmic slope in the relation @xmath34 .",
    "the solid curves in figure  3 illustrate the global responsivities as functions of radius of h@xmath2 ( _ bottom left _ ) , h@xmath3 ( _ top left _ ) , @xmath05876 ( _ top right _ ) , and @xmath04686 ( _ bottom right _ ) for this large change in continuum state .",
    "we emphasize that the major changes in responsivity with radius are not a result of our choice of fixed - column density clouds ; this is discussed below .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves represent the responsivities for small changes in the continuum flux about the high and low continuum states , respectively , and these are discussed in @xmath4  3.1 and @xmath4  3.3 .",
    "it is clear from the global responsivities that larger relative variations of these emission lines surface fluxes due to changes in the continuum state can be expected to occur at larger radii where the incident continuum fluxes are smaller .",
    "we can understand the general trends in line responsivity , with a minimum number of model dependent assumptions , through a study of figure  1 .",
    "we can relate the responsivity to the gradient in the ew contours in figure  1 as @xmath35 the responsivity is proportional to the efficiency in converting a _ change _ in the number of ionizing continuum photons into escaping line photons , and so is in proportion to the change in ew contours shown in figure  1 relative to the incident photon flux . for a fixed scale in cloud distance from the central ionizing source ,",
    "the ew contours in figure  1 shift vertically upward with a decrease in the continuum luminosity , and shift vertically downward with an increase in the continuum luminosity .",
    "clouds in the density - flux plane for which the line ew distribution is either flat or changes little with the incident photon flux have responsivities that lie near 1 ( i.e. , roughly 1:1 line : continuum variations ) for that line ( see , especially , @xmath04686 ) . those clouds whose line ews increase with increasing incident photon flux have responsivities exceeding 1 for that line ( bottoms of the panels for each of these lines except ly@xmath3 ) .",
    "those clouds whose line ews decrease with increasing incident photon flux have responsivities less than 1 for that line : the steeper the gradient , the lower the responsivity .",
    "finally , where the line ews decline very rapidly with incident photon flux in the density - flux plane ( near the central diagonal of the figures ) , the emission line responsivities become negative .    to illustrate these effects ,",
    "in figure  4 we superpose a responsivity grey - scale on the ew contours for each of the lines in figure  1 .",
    "the grey - scale representations are : @xmath36 ( _ white _ ) , @xmath37 ( _ light gray _ ) , @xmath38 ( _ medium gray _ ) , @xmath39 ( _ medium dark gray _ ) , @xmath40 ( _ dark gray _ ) , and @xmath41 ( _ black _ , appears only in ) . given that we generally measure @xmath42 for the broad emission lines , this diagram shows how the emissivity and responsivity together constrain the cloud properties , especially their distribution in radius from the continuum source .",
    "we now briefly describe how the responsivities of the optical recombination lines arise . at sufficiently high gas densities and ionizing photon fluxes , each of these four emission lines ews diminish with increasing value of the ionizing photon flux ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this indicates a lessening efficiency of the conversion of ionizing continuum photons to escaping line photons for those clouds lying nearer to the continuum source .",
    "this is primarily due to the increasing populations and thus optical depths in the excited states of hydrogen and helium with increasing continuum flux ( netzer 1975 ; netzer 1978 ; ferland & netzer 1979 ; ferland , netzer , & shields 1979 ; kwan 1984 ; rees , netzer , & ferland 1989 ; ferland et  al .",
    "1992 ; shields & ferland 1993 ) , i.e. , thermalization at large optical depth . at a given continuum flux ,",
    "the optical depth of h@xmath3 is largest , followed by h@xmath2 , @xmath05876 , and @xmath04686 ( rees et  al .",
    "various background opacities also play a role ( shields & ferland 1993 ) , and photoionization out of excited states of hydrogen becomes effective for densities exceeding @xmath43  @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , those high density clouds lying above roughly the ew(h@xmath45   contour ( 0.7 dex ) in figure  1 lack a hydrogen ionization front for this reason . as a consequence of these optical depth effects ,",
    "the more substantial relative flux variations in these four emission lines tend to be weighted by clouds lying at larger radii",
    ". this latter point should be true to some extent for most emission lines , since they too suffer from diminished efficiency in the conversion of ionizing continuum photons into escaping line photons at smaller radii where the gas densities of clouds that emit the lines must be higher .",
    "refer to figure  2 of kg00 for the ew contours in the density - flux plane for the stronger uv emission lines .",
    "the @xmath02800 emission line is most like the balmer lines in this respect , and we would expect that line to have a similarly low responsivity ( see figure  2b in kg00 ) .",
    "this is indeed generally observed ( e.g. , see clavel et  al .",
    "clouds fully ionized in hydrogen ( such as those lying near or within the rapidly declining ew contours running diagonally in the density - flux planes in figure  1 ) , with their very low ( @xmath46  0 ) or even negative responsivities , might in principle be arranged in such a way as to substantially reduce the line responsivity at the larger radii .",
    "however , these low efficiency clouds will not contribute much light and therefore will add little to the integrated line response unless their covering fractions are very large .    for time - scales of the order of the light - travel time across the blr , the power spectrum of the continuum fluctuations coupled with light - travel time effects across a finite geometry will also factor into the variations of an emission line s flux and perhaps profile . however , _ it is the responsivity that establishes the outer envelope of these variations_. light travel time effects can only act to reduce or dilute the observed line response .",
    "we reiterate that the variations in the line intensity ratios and line profiles presented here are _ not _ due to light travel time effects ( e.g. , see robinson , prez , & binette 1990 ; prez , robinson , & de  la  fuente 1992 ; pogge & peterson 1992 ) or other geometrical effects ( e.g. , line anisotropy , obrien , goad , & gondhalekar 1994 ) , but are rather due to differences in the time - averaged photon flux incident on a spatially extended blr and their effect on the line emissivity .",
    "krolik et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) , pogge & peterson ( 1992 ) , and gilbert & peterson ( 2003 ) have found that reverberation effects on the @xmath47 relation can be largely removed by correcting the emission - line light - curves for their mean time - delays .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then any residual line  continuum flux correlations must be primarily due to the responsivity of the gas in the blr , as we have defined here .",
    "however , if a line s transfer function has a long tail in time delay ( in comparison to the important continuum variability time scales ) , simply removing the lag may not sufficiently correct for this geometric dilution of the line response . the observed lag - corrected emission - line response will then be a function of the line s responsivity , as defined here , and the prior continuum history .",
    "more advanced methods , such as that introduced by horne et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , may then be needed to disentangle the effects .",
    "finally , it is apparent from figs .  1 , 3 , and 4 that @xmath04686 should be the most responsive emission line of the four optical emission lines discussed here , followed by , h@xmath2 , and lastly h@xmath3 .",
    "this is observed ( e.g. , see wamsteker et  al .",
    "1990 ; dietrich et  al .  1993 ; kollatschny 2003 ) .",
    "the model effective global responsivities of these four emission lines are listed in column  ( 2 ) of table  1 . to illustrate the trends within the balmer line series",
    ", we also plot the ew distribution of h@xmath11 @xmath04340 within the density - flux plane in figure  1 , list its effective responsivity in table  1 , and illustrate its responsivity in the density - flux plane in figure  4 .",
    "ly@xmath3 @xmath01216 is also a recombination line , but with different physics , and so we provide the same information for it .",
    "figure  3 shows that the responsivity of h@xmath2 is expected to be a strong function of radius , varying from @xmath46  0.2 in the inner blr to @xmath46  1 at the outer radius .",
    "more generally , this is indicated by the gradient in the ew contours with respect to the ionizing photon flux in figure  1 ( see also eq .",
    "2 ) , and coarsely illustrated in figure  4 .",
    "another interesting point raised by figure  3 is that the h@xmath2 line response should be significantly stronger during low continuum flux states than during high ones for similar continuum fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  3 by the dotted and dashed curves representing the low and high continuum state h@xmath2 line responsivity , respectively , computed for small ( 0.1 dex ) variations about the high and low states .",
    "the effective responsivities in the high and low states are given in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of table  1 .",
    "k.  horne ( 2002 , private communication ) and cackett & horne ( 2005 ) recovered the luminosity - dependent delay map for the 13 yr monitoring campaign of the h@xmath2 broad emission line of ngc  5548 , and found a similar relation between the amplitude of the line response with continuum state .",
    "figure  3 and columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of table  1 shows that all of these lines display generally larger effective responsivities at larger distances ( lower incident photon fluxes ) and during lower continuum states .",
    "additionally , the amplitude of the change in effective responsivity with continuum state differs substantially between the balmer and helium lines , and this should be diagnostic of the physical conditions within the blr .",
    "by contrast , ly@xmath3 shows very little variation in responsivity with cloud parameters ( fig .",
    "4 ) , and as a consequence shows a very modest change in @xmath33 with continuum state ( table  1 ) .",
    "we elucidate the change in the radial responsivity with continuum state shown in figure  3 , using @xmath04686 by way of example . in both continuum states",
    ", the responsivity at large radii is nearly independent of radius and continuum state .",
    "this is simply a reflection of the general lack of dependence of the line ew with incident continuum flux for @xmath48 ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the balmer lines , especially h@xmath3 .",
    "note also in figure  4 that most of the variations of @xmath49 ( ) with incident photon flux occur for @xmath50 ; here in particular @xmath49 declines with increasing @xmath51 .",
    "this dependence of the responsivity on incident continuum flux makes this line s radial responsivity at small distances quite dependent on the continuum state as well .",
    "these effects are also illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "the `` knee '' in the radial responsivity of occurs at the radius corresponding to @xmath52 for each continuum state , or @xmath53 ( 7 lt - days ) in the mean continuum state .",
    "simply put , strong anti - correlations between the line ew and the incident photon flux will correspond to anti - correlations between @xmath49 and the incident photon flux , which in turn will result in similar anti - correlations between @xmath49 and the continuum state .",
    "likewise , @xmath33 will anti - correlate with the continuum state , as weighted by the line s radial luminosity function . based on single power - law cloud distribution models , obrien ,",
    "goad , & gondhalekar ( 1995 ) also found `` a decrease in the mean response when the continuum flux increases . ''    by definition",
    ", a time - varying responsivity @xmath54 implies that the line transfer function , @xmath55 ) , is time - dependent ( i.e. , non - stationary ) . in this case",
    "the time dependence is due to changes in the time - averaged photon flux incident on a spatially extended blr .",
    "we therefore expect the measured lags of the emission lines and their profile shapes to depend on the luminosity state of the continuum ( @xmath4  3.3 & @xmath4  3.4 ) . we note that unless the velocity field is self - similar in radius ( goad et  al .",
    "1999 ) , a profile shape that depends on the continuum luminosity state fails a hysteresis test ( see wanders 1994 ; perry , van  groningen , & wanders 1994 ) .",
    "this is true without invoking a redistribution of material within the blr or other geometrical effects as suggested by wanders & peterson ( 1996 ) .",
    "detailed analyses of the agn broad emission - line response to continuum variations in spectrophotometric monitoring campaigns show that in all cases the responsivity in most measured lines is @xmath56 , even after accounting for light travel - time effects ( e.g. , krolik et  al.1991 ) . referring to eq .  2",
    ", we see that this requires the line equivalent width to diminish with increasing continuum flux and vice versa : the intrinsic baldwin effect ( @xmath57 ; see kinney , rivolo , & koratkar 1990 ; krolik et  al .",
    "1991 ; pogge & peterson 1992 ; peterson 1997 ; gilbert & peterson 2003 ) . in concurrence with gilbert & peterson the present work suggests that the origin of the intrinsic baldwin effect is due either in whole or in large part to the line s responsivity being less than 1 throughout the majority of a distribution of largely ionization - bounded clouds ( as shown in figure  1 ) , i.e. , without the _ necessity _ of a large population of matter - bounded clouds ( shields , ferland , & peterson 1995 ) , although we do not rule these out .",
    "as discussed above we expect @xmath58 for most lines , and thus most lines should demonstrate an intrinsic baldwin effect , since the intrinsic baldwin effect index @xmath2 is related to the responsivity as @xmath59 .",
    "based on single power law cloud distribution models , obrien , goad , & gondhalekar ( 1995 ) showed that an intrinsic baldwin effect can be induced in any line by changing its responsivity with continuum level . while we concur with these findings , we find a more general and significant origin for this effect , namely @xmath58 as defined and described in @xmath4  3 .",
    "our simple model for the blr of ngc  5548 predicts an @xmath33 for h@xmath2 of 0.54 in the 1989 high state and 0.77 in the 1992 low state ( columns ( 2 )  ( 4 ) , table  1 ) .",
    "that is , we expect @xmath33 and so the slope in the intrinsic baldwin effect to be a function of continuum state .",
    "compare the dotted and dashed lines in figure  3 .",
    "this predicted range in @xmath33 approximately brackets that measured in the same object by gilbert & peterson ( 2003 ) of @xmath60 .",
    "a line s equivalent width is usually measured with respect to the local continuum , and gilbert & peterson ( 2003 ) found that the underlying continuum becomes bluer when brighter in this object , such that @xmath61 .",
    "they then suggested that since the @xmath01350 continuum lies closer to the ionizing continuum , it might be better to reference the h@xmath2 flux to it , and found the relation @xmath62 .",
    "our simulations assumed that the sed remains constant as its amplitude changes .",
    "thus , while it is difficult to make detailed comparisons , we expect that sed changes are a secondary effect on the line responsivity ; we discuss the impact of a variable sed on line responsivity in @xmath4  4.2 .",
    "the point remains that line responsivity , as defined here , is likely to be responsible for much of the observed intrinsic baldwin effect .",
    "what can the intrinsic baldwin effect tell us about the blr ?",
    "because the ew contours of the balmer lines in particular in figure  1 are so nearly proportional to the incident continuum flux , we suggest that measurements of the responsivities of these emission lines will point to the distribution of the optical recombination line - emitting entities in the density - flux plane . low density gas ( @xmath63 @xmath44 ) illuminated by low values of the ionizing photon flux ( @xmath64 @xmath13s@xmath65 ) , and gas at any density illuminated by even lower values of @xmath51 ( @xmath66 ) will emit these optical recombination lines , but they _ will not respond appropriately _ to variations in the ionizing continuum .",
    "the responsivities of these clouds in these lines are @xmath46  1 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "such models would fall far short of reproducing the observed variations in h@xmath2 , _ independent _ of any considerations of the line luminosity or lag .",
    "next , the observed mean responsivity of the optical @xmath04686 line , @xmath68 ( see , for example , dietrich et  al .",
    "1993 ; also krolik et  al.1991 ) , necessarily implies that a significant fraction of this line forms in gas exposed to high incident ionizing continuum fluxes on average ( @xmath69  @xmath13  s@xmath65 , or @xmath70 light days in ngc  5548 ) , as well as relatively high densities .",
    "this is just as its measured lag indicates ( clavel et  al .  1991 ; k95 ) .",
    "thus , figures  3 and 4 predict a positive correlation between the lag of each of these lines and their responsivity , @xmath33 , for a particular continuum state ( see also carroll 1985 ) .",
    "so together the luminosity , lag , _ and _ responsivity ( intrinsic baldwin effect ) of each of the broad emission lines for a range of continuum states should constrain the distribution of blr cloud properties in gas density , distance from the ionizing continuum source , and column density .",
    "the quasar tomography method of horne et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) is particularly well suited to this task , and we discuss this further in @xmath4  4.3 .",
    "netzer & maoz ( 1990 ) reported that different lags for the broad emission lines of ly@xmath3 and were found for each of the three continuum variability events during the 1989 campaign of ngc  5548 ( clavel et  al .",
    "1991 ) . based on data from an earlier optical campaign ( netzer et  al .",
    "1990 ) , netzer & maoz also reported a significantly different lag for h@xmath2 than did peterson et  al .",
    "while acknowledging that a variable continuum acf will change the lag , netzer & maoz ( 1990 ) suggested that at least part of the origin of these time - dependent lags lay in a non - linear emission - line response . over the full 13 yr monitoring campaign of ngc  5548 peterson et  al .",
    "( 2002 ; see also peterson et  al.1999 ) found that the h@xmath2 emission - line lag scales with the mean continuum level , such that @xmath71 , albeit with much scatter .",
    "this positively correlated behavior of the lag with continuum state has been called `` breathing . '' after positing that the uv continuum is more intimately connected to the driving ionizing continuum and accounting for the relation that they found between the @xmath05100 and @xmath01350 continuum bands ( @xmath72 ) , the relation @xmath73 resulted .",
    "peterson et  al.(2002 ) then proposed that @xmath74 might be a natural consequence of a simple ionization parameter - type argument that @xmath75 .",
    "cackett & horne ( 2005 ) , too , have found evidence of breathing in their transfer function analysis of the 13 yr spectroscopic dataset of peterson et  al .",
    "a breathing blr has also been proposed by goad et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) to explain line profile variation differences between and in ngc  3516 . in this subsection",
    ", we address a likely origin of breathing blrs and comment on the conclusions drawn by peterson et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) in regards to this issue .",
    "the single power law cloud distribution models of obrien , goad , & gondhalekar ( 1995 ) predicted a relation between line lag and incident continuum level ( for a fixed sed ) due to a non - linear emission - line response .",
    "the results presented here for the optical recombination lines based on more general models arrive at the same conclusion .",
    "the shift in the lag as a function of the continuum state is a reflection of an outward shift in the line s luminosity - weighted radius to gas at larger radii that is better able to reprocess the increased continuum luminosity into line emission , and vice versa in low continuum states .",
    "the ew contours in figs .  1 and 4 shift vertically as the source luminosity changes , causing corresponding changes in the radial responsivity and hence responsivity - weighted radii .",
    "we therefore expect that elevated continuum states will be accompanied by an increase in the line lag and a decrease in the line responsivity .",
    "breathing will not occur for lines for which the responsivity as a function of radius and ionizing continuum level is constant .",
    "a constant @xmath76 implies that the emissivity - weighted and responsivity - weighted radii are the same ( see goad et  al .",
    "1993 ) , and therefore the measured lag is independent of the continuum state",
    ". therefore , if after correcting for reverberation effects , the measured lag varies with luminosity , then so must its effective responsivity .",
    "although gilbert & peterson ( 2003 ) did not note any evidence for changes in @xmath33 with continuum level , b.  peterson ( 2003 , private communication ) finds that a detailed analysis of the 13 yr campaign on a year - to - year basis indicates changes in the line  continuum flux slope .",
    "it is also significant that while blrs whose lines breathe must show an intrinsic baldwin effect for those lines , the converse is not true .",
    "for example , for the case of @xmath77 everywhere , no breathing will occur , but an intrinsic baldwin effect will be present .    the two triangles in each panel of figure  3 mark the positions of the responsivity - weighted radii ( @xmath78 ) of h@xmath2 and the other three emission lines for the two continuum states .",
    "in the case of h@xmath2 , it is larger in the high continuum state by a factor of @xmath46  1.6 relative to the low state .",
    "this is about the same ratio of luminosity dependent lags observed in this line in ngc  5548 for the same two continuum states ( @xmath46  1.7 ; peterson et  al .",
    "2002 ; see also wanders & peterson 1996 ; cackett & horne 2005 ) , although we note that the measured lag is expected to be smaller than @xmath79 by a factor of a few ( e.g. , see prez et  al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the effective line responsivities for the high and low continuum state are given in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of table  1 .",
    "as discussed in @xmath43.1 , the low - state responsivity is higher in every case , and figure  3 shows that the line s radial responsivity and @xmath78 shift to larger distances in higher continuum states . for this particular model , the responsivity - weighted radius scales as @xmath80 , with @xmath81 0.15 , 0.23 , 0.38 , and 0.44 for h@xmath3 , h@xmath2 , , and , respectively .",
    "these relations should be diagnostic of the physical conditions within the blr .",
    "the general relation proposed by peterson et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , above ( @xmath82 ) , is expected to hold only if the line responsivity is constant over a large portion of the blr with a steep break to lower responsivity ( see for example , in figure  3 ) , and so is not the general case .",
    "the breathing amplitude ( e.g. , the value of @xmath11 ) is expected to depend on the responsivity and the extent to which the responsivity changes with both radius and continuum state in the vicinity of @xmath78 ( compare dotted and dashed curves for each of the lines in figure  3 ) . using the relation between the @xmath05100 and @xmath01350 continuum fluxes for ngc  5548 ( gilbert & peterson 2003 ; but see also peterson et  al .  for a slightly different value ) , and assuming that @xmath83 is a proxy for the driving continuum , k.  horne ( 2002 , private communication ) and cackett & horne ( 2005 ) find a similarly weaker relation between the h@xmath2 lag and continuum luminosity state for the 13 yr campaign of ngc  5548 as do we .",
    "in addition , since @xmath11 is related to the responsivity , it too changes with continuum level ( see also obrien et  al .  1995 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the expected larger line response during low continuum states ( @xmath4  3.1 ) will be enhanced by the fact that an effectively smaller line - emitting region , due to this breathing , respond more coherently to a given continuum variation .",
    "the opposite hold for variations about high continuum states .",
    "the combined effect can be investigated in data sets such as the 13 yr h@xmath2 light curve presented in peterson et  al .",
    "( 2002 ; their figure  1 ) : more coherent and larger amplitude responses in h@xmath2 should generally be found at low continuum states , while just the opposite should result during high continuum states .",
    "one might also find differences in line responsivity between two comparably low continuum states that immediately straddle a high continuum state in time , due to light travel time effects that are not removed from the second low state by simply correcting for the lag .      in this section , we investigate the expected changes in the integrated line flux ratios due to changes in the continuum state .",
    "it should now be apparent that such line ratio variations will result simply because the responsivities differ between the emission lines .",
    "lines with greater responsivities vary with greater amplitudes with changing continuum state , and so line flux ratios can be expected to change as well .",
    "other factors may play a role , but responsivity effects will be present regardless .",
    "figure  5 illustrates the h@xmath3/h@xmath2 line flux ratio varying across the density - flux plane , from roughly 17 ( near the triangle at the bottom ) to approximately 1 ( near coordinates : [ 13.5 , 22.5 ] ) .",
    "the classical nebular theory of hydrogen balmer lines ( menzel case  b ) does not apply to the gas occupying the blr .",
    "for example , at coordinate [ 12.0 , 19.5 ] in the density - flux plane ( corresponding to a distance of 22 lt - days in the mean continuum state ) , case  b predicts h@xmath3 and h@xmath2 fluxes that are 20.8@xmath84 and 30.4@xmath84 larger than that emitted by the cloud . the case  b h@xmath3/h@xmath2 flux ratio is 2.35 , whereas the ratio predicted by cloudy is 3.44 . over a significant portion of the density - flux plane _",
    "this ratio is inversely proportional to the incident continuum flux _",
    ", as expected from the optical depth effects mentioned earlier , and in agreement with the findings of rees , netzer , & ferland ( 1989 ; see also netzer 1975 ) . this being the case , it is easy to imagine this ratio changing in response to variations in the incident continuum luminosity .",
    "thus , differences in responsivity among the balmer lines , as illustrated in figs .",
    "1 , 3 , 4 and as listed in table  1 , probably account for most of the observed steepening in the broad - line balmer decrement as the continuum drops into low states , and flattening in high states .",
    "there have been many such broad line balmer decrement / continuum state correlations reported in the spectra of variable seyfert  1 galaxies ( see , for example , antonucci & cohen 1983 ; ferland , korista , & peterson 1990 ; wamsteker et  al .",
    "1990 ; tran , osterbrock , & martel 1992 ) . integrated over this model s full broad line - emitting region , the h@xmath3/h@xmath2 flux ratio changes from 4.9 in the low state to 3.7 in the high state .",
    "while the particulars are model dependent , the trend generally is not .",
    "the balmer decrement s variations with the incident continuum level should be sensitive to the distribution of clouds in the density - flux plane .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that a seyfert  1 galaxy s sub - classification as seyfert  1.0 , 1.5 , 1.8 , or 1.9 ( as defined in osterbrock 1989 , and references therein ) may at least in part be due to the relative flux of ionizing photons present within their broad - line regions at the time of observation . that is , any given spectrum of a seyfert type  1 agn may pass through some of these sub - classifications as its continuum luminosity fluctuates from high ( seyfert  1 or 1.5 ) to low continuum states ( seyfert  1.8 or 1.9 ) .",
    "in high continuum luminosity states , a larger broad - line contribution to the total ( broad + narrow ) balmer line profile will be present and the broad balmer line decrement will be flatter . in low continuum luminosity states , the broad - line contribution to the total balmer line profile will be relatively much smaller , and the broad balmer line decrement will be steeper .",
    "ngc  5548 is generally classified as seyfert  1.5 .",
    "however , the order - of - magnitude continuum fluctuations that occurred over the 13 yr optical monitoring campaign ( peterson et  al .",
    "2002 ) probably drove the balmer emission - line spectrum from seyfert type 1.8 in 1992 to perhaps seyfert type 1.0 in 1998 .",
    "as described above , the balmer lines should show less flux variation with continuum state than , which in turn should show less variation than .",
    "this trend is generally observed ( peterson & ferland 1986 ; ferland , korista , & peterson 1990 ; wamsteker et  al .",
    "1990 ; dietrich et  al .  1993 ; peterson et  al .  1993 ; kollatschny 2003 ) .",
    "particularly interesting is that observed changes in the h@xmath2/ flux ratio may , at least in part , due to _ differences in the way these two lines respond to the level of the ionizing continuum flux _ , rather than to changes in the shape of the ionizing sed .",
    "for the model presented here , this ratio drops by nearly a factor of 2 from the low to high continuum states . to a lesser extent , this is likewise true for the / line ratio , which changes by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "such a responsivity effect may have played a role in the observation of a large increase in the @xmath04686 equivalent width in comparison to h@xmath2 during a large increase in the continuum luminosity in ngc  5548 ( peterson & ferland 1986 ) and likewise in a similar event reported by peterson et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) in ngc  4051 .",
    "while the broad line /h@xmath2 flux ratio is sensitive to the ionizing sed , the usual photon - counting ( zanstra ) argument used to measure the 13.6 to 54.4  ev continuum sed applies strictly when these lines are emitted in gas whose properties allow for responsivities @xmath85 , as would be true if case  b applied for both lines .",
    "however , these conditions _ do not _ apply for the balmer lines emitted within the blr , but they can be found within the narrow line regions of agns ( see the ew distributions of the recombination lines in ferguson et  al .",
    "1997 ) or within galactic nebulae . on the other hand , the emissivity does not stray too far from that expected from case  b for most conditions expected in the blr , as indicated by its comparatively featureless ew distribution in the density - flux plane for @xmath86 ( see also bottorff et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "finally , as a matter of general interest we note that the ly@xmath3/h@xmath2 flux ratio should correlate with the continuum flux , and apparently this is the case in the well - studied agn ngc  5548 ( wamsteker et  al .",
    "the ew contours of ly@xmath3 in the density - flux plane ( see figure  1 , _ bottom right _ ) do not show as strong continuum flux dependencies as do the balmer lines , and so @xmath49(ly@xmath87(h@xmath2 ) can be expected , with larger differences to come from gas nearer to the continuum source where the responsivity of h@xmath2 is small ( see also figure  4 ) . the combined conclusions of pogge & peterson ( 1992 ) and gilbert & peterson ( 2003 ) would indicate an observed relation of @xmath88ly@xmath89h@xmath90 in ngc  5548 .",
    "our simple model ( see table  1 ) predicts a similar relation @xmath88ly@xmath89h@xmath91 , which is steeper in high continuum states and shallower in low ones .",
    "shields & ferland ( 1993 ) discussed some of the mechanisms behind the destruction of ly@xmath3 emitted by broad - line clouds .",

    "this choice of dynamical model is motivated by simplicity for purposes of demonstration .",
    "the low - state continuum emission - line profiles of the four lines under study , as predicted by our simple loc model line emissivity and velocity field , are shown in figure  6 , normalized to their peak intensities .",
    "we note that the flat tops to these profiles are artifacts of the assumption of circular orbits , and their extents are determined by the local keplerian velocity at the distance of the model s outer radius ( 140 lt - days ) given the assumed central mass .",
    "the ew distributions shown in figure  1 , and most notably the continuum flux at the onset of significant thermalization , are roughly reflected in the widths of the emission - line profiles in figure  6 , as well as in their observed lags ( dietrich et  al .",

    "the trend in line widths is in general agreement with those found in the models presented by rees , netzer , & ferland ( 1989 ) .    since the lines under study here are recombination lines involving just one or two electrons , they are emissive over very broad areas within the density - flux plane , unlike the collisionally excited metal lines which are very sensitive to the ionization parameter .",
    "the balmer and lines span essentially equal areas of significant emissivity within the density - flux plane _ without regard to ionization parameter _ , and that of does likewise for @xmath95 ( see figure  1 ) . while it is also true that a cloud of a given column density will become fully he@xmath96 at a higher ionization parameter than for h@xmath97 , this difference is small ( see figure  1 ) . by far most of the differences in emissivity among the balmer and lines",
    "are due to the optical depth effects discussed above , and this is also true for the lines except for clouds with @xmath98 . stated another way , if all of these lines were emitted with their case  b emissivities within the blr , much smaller differences in their profiles and lags would be expected .",
    "figure  7 shows the long term ( global ) responsivities for each of the four emission lines as a function of radial velocity across their line profiles , for our simple velocity field . because of the larger response in the line cores ,",
    "the broad emission - line component of the balmer lines should become narrower / peakier in higher continuum states , and broader / less peaky during low continuum states ( cf . , h@xmath3 variations in ngc  5548 ; stirpe et  al .",
    "1988 ) ; refer also to the model high and low continuum state fwhms as listed in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in table  1 .",
    "in fact for this particular model , a continuum state that is a factor of 12@xmath84 brighter than the low state produces a fwhm in h@xmath2 that is 1000 @xmath99 narrower than that in the low state . the response across the profile of is _ much higher _ , although again this emission line would be expected to be somewhat narrower during higher continuum states .",
    "the response across the profile of is not as broad as and not as peaky as the balmer lines . in every case , _ we expect the response in the line cores to be stronger than in the line wings_. the relative change in the fwhm of the emission line with continuum state is effectively a reflection of the `` breathing '' blr as caused by changes in the line responsivity , as we discussed in @xmath4  3.3 .",
    "obrien , goad , & gondhalekar ( 1995 ) similarly linked non - linear emission - line response to line profile variability , although this general conclusion was based on single power law cloud models .",
    "since the responsivity of these lines is expected to be radially dependent and this function differs between emission - line species , we expect radial velocity - dependent variations in the line intensity ratios .",
    "these effects are illustrated in figure  8 , which shows the velocity - dependent balmer decrement ( h@xmath3/h@xmath2 ) for the low - state ( _ dotted line _ ) and high - state ( _ solid line _ ) continuum .",
    "note that in both cases the balmer decrement is steeper in the line core than in the line wings , and the balmer decrement shows larger changes with continuum level in the line core ( from 5.6 to 4.0 ) , than in the line wings ( from 3.0 to 2.7 ) .",
    "the first of these effects has been well - established ( see , for example , shuder 1982 , 1984 ; osterbrock & shuder 1982 ; van  groningen 1984 , 1987 ; crenshaw 1986 ; stirpe 1990 , 1991 ; kollatschny 2003 ) , and we are aware of just one study of the time - dependent variability of the balmer decrement as a function of radial velocity ( stirpe , de  bruyn , & van  groningen 1988 ) . both behaviors imply that _ the velocity field must decrease with increasing radius from the central source_. as just presented above , a weaker response in an individual line s wings in comparison to its core ( fig .",
    "7 ) would also argue for such a velocity field .",
    "these findings are consistent with recent reverberation studies that find a relationship between the emission - line lag and rms profile width for multiple lines in individual agns , which implies that the velocity field is dominated by the central massive object ( peterson & wandel 1999 , 2000 ; fromerth & melia 2000 ) .",
    "the results presented here also predict a smaller h@xmath2/ intensity ratio in the line wings than in the core ( fig .",
    "the ew contours in figure  1 coupled with a velocity field that diminishes with increasing distance from the central source provide possible explanations for this generally observed phenomenon ( shuder 1982 , 1984 ; osterbrock & shuder 1982 ; crenshaw 1986 ; van  groningen 1984 , 1987 ; rees , netzer , & ferland 1989 ; kollatschny 2003 ) .",
    "these lines ews peak up at similarly high densities , but the line peaks up at significantly higher photon fluxes ( smaller radii ) , because of its lower optical depth .",

    "whether or not the specific dependencies of the continuum state / responsivity effects described in this section are present in the spectra of ngc  5548 or other variable seyfert  1 agns is not particularly important .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of line responsivity to model assumptions in the appendix .",
    "instead , the emphasis of this paper lies mainly in illuminating the mostly untapped wealth of the potentially powerful physical diagnostics present in high quality spectrophotometric data sets of the optical recombination lines , and that their emissivities sensitivity to the continuum flux makes them particularly effective diagnostics of the radially dependent physical conditions within the blr .",
    "that the blr may contain a significant component of ionized gas that is optically thin to hydrogen - ionizing photons has been suggested by investigators over many years . in nearly every case",

    "( 1997 ) were based on analyses of _ time - resolved _",
    "spectral observations of the continuum and h@xmath2 , most of the above studies relied on very few , often just two , observation epochs .",
    "without sufficient time resolution of the variability , it is difficult to assess the actual line response .",
    "additional arguments for an optically thin line - emitting region have been put forth through the analyses of line flux ratios in the profile wings : optical balmer and lines ( marziani & sulentic 1993 ; corbin 1997 ) , balmer and @xmath01549 ( corbin 1995 ) , balmer and ly@xmath3 line profiles ( zheng 1992 ) , and balmer and @xmath08446 profiles ( morris & ward 1989 ) .",
    "while at any given continuum state the broad emission - line region may well contain clouds fully ionized in hydrogen , as the present model does , the results presented here suggest that there is no great need for a major line - emitting component consisting of vast amounts of optically thin gas .",
    "most of the effects mentioned just above regarding the balmer and helium recombination lines can be explained by the effects we described in @xmath4  3 : weak balmer line emission and response need not originate in clouds optically thin to the lyman continuum . while an emission line such as @xmath0774 is likely to be emitted mainly within clouds that lack a hydrogen ionization front ( e.g. , see hamann et  al.1998 ; korista et  al .",
    "1997 ) , we have also pointed out that by their very nature fully - ionized clouds are inefficient emitters of hydrogen recombination lines ( refer again to figure  1 ) , and so are unlikely to be important energetically even if their covering fraction is large .",
    "this is especially true in the face of a variable ionizing continuum source ; clouds will more likely be either ionization - bounded or too overionized to emit balmer lines of any significance .",
    "it is also significant that the matter - bounded clouds in figure  4 either have small positive ( _ lightest gray _ )  0 lie above the diagonal line @xmath101 and also within the lightest gray shaded region . ] or negative ( white ) responsivities .",
    "even if present , the latter type clouds never make their presence known in these emission lines , which is not surprising given their extremely low emitting efficiencies .    in regards to the comparisons of balmer and ly@xmath3 line profiles , as mentioned in @xmath4  3.4 , the ew contours of ly@xmath3 in the density - flux plane ( see figure  1 , _ bottom",
    "right _ ) do not show the strong continuum flux dependencies of the balmer lines .",
    "we suspect that this , along with the presence of a radially decreasing velocity field , accounts for the very large ly@xmath3/h@xmath2 ratios found in the emission - line wings by zheng ( 1992 ) , rather than these ratios being due to a major constituent of optically thin emitting gas .    finally , we also point out that many of the above studies assumed that case  b emissivities apply to the hydrogen lines emitted by optically thick clouds in the blr and attributed significant deviations from expected ratios to an optically thin emitting region .",
    "we conclude that a separate optically thin vblr may be unnecessary , and in any case for the balmer lines is probably energetically unimportant .",
    "the wings of the hydrogen recombination lines likely represent nothing more than the inner blr where the balmer line emission is inefficient and the responsivity low .",

    "all else being equal , harder incident continua result in higher electron temperatures , and so major cooling lines ( e.g. , @xmath01549 ) might be expected to increase their energy output in response .",
    "one should also keep in mind that the incident flux at energies corresponding to the _ balmer _ continuum is important to the destruction of hydrogen emission lines for the high gas densities encountered in the blr ( shields & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "also , harder continua during brighter uv - opt continuum states might also mean comparatively more photons above 1  ryd and/or 4  ryd , favoring the production of hydrogen and helium recombination lines .",
    "kaspi & netzer ( 1999 ) considered an sed whose break near 4  ryd moves to higher energies for brighter uv continuum states ( their figure  8d ) , with the effect of increasing the 4  ryd/1  ryd photon flux ratio with increasing @xmath01350 continuum luminosity .",
    "however , in this variable sed scheme , the flux above 20  ryd ( 270  ev ) remained constant .",
    "a comparison of their figs .  7 ( fixed sed ) and 9 ( variable sed ) that show their model predictions of five uv emission lines light curves versus observations illustrates some of the aforementioned effects of a variable continuum sed on line responsivity . while they included  @xmath01640 in their simulations , such was not the case for the balmer lines .",
    "their prescription for a variable continuum sed increased the responsivities of the and ly@xmath3 lines , whereas those of  @xmath01549 , ] @xmath01909 , and @xmath02800 decreased , presumably because the variations in the continuum beyond @xmath46  150  ev were smaller in their variable sed scheme than for the constant sed .",
    "it is also apparent that the lags of and increased in the higher continuum states , because of a shift to larger responsivity - weighted radii .",
    "the method of `` quasar tomography , '' proposed by horne et  al.(2003 ) , is a unification of reverberation mapping and photoionization physics .",
    "its goal is to place physical constraints on the recovered two - dimensional transfer function map @xmath103 of the broad emission lines , as well as to recover the gas distribution described by a five - dimensional map @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the time delay , @xmath106 is the observed radial velocity , @xmath107 is the distance from the continuum source , and @xmath108 is the angle from the line of sight .",
    "the sensitivity of the emissivities ( ew contours in figure  1 ) of the optical recombination lines to the continuum flux , and the resulting consequences to their responsivities , make these lines important candidates for inclusion in the quasar tomography .",
    "horne et  al",
    ".  found that when applied to the mostly collisionally excited uv emission lines , a certain amount of ambiguity arises in the recovery of the maps due to the weak dependencies in their ews ( and so responsivities ) along lines of constant ionization parameter ( @xmath109 ) corresponding to their maximum emissivities .",
    "their emissivities and responsivities are largely dependent on @xmath110 , with smaller dependencies in gas density due to de - excitation or thermalization .",
    "the optical recombination lines , along with @xmath02800 , offer additional constraints in determining the physical conditions within the blr , in that their emissivities and responsivities are dependent on the local continuum flux and so radius for a fixed central continuum luminosity , as well as changes in this flux as the central continuum source varies .",
    "the response of the optical recombination lines to continuum variations , especially the balmer lines , depends critically on the time - averaged photon flux incident on a spatially extended blr .",
    "this strong dependence exists because of the enhanced excited state populations ( and so optical depths ) that occur at higher continuum flux levels , given the high gas densities found in the blrs of agns .",
    "the emissivities , and hence responsivities , @xmath49 , of these lines are generally strongly anticorrelated with the continuum flux , so @xmath49 changes with distance within the blr for a fixed continuum luminosity and with time as the continuum source varies .",
    "below are the major implications , most of which provide explanations for observed relationships :    1 .",
    "we predict an intrinsic baldwin effect due to this non - linear response , specifically @xmath111 , in most emission lines , including the balmer lines , even after accounting for geometric dilution due to reverberation .",
    "this is a finding that has only recently been observationally confirmed .",
    "regarding the optical recombination lines , this effect should be small for @xmath04686 ( with responsivity @xmath112 ) , but significant for the balmer lines .",
    "we predict that the higher order balmer lines are more responsive , @xmath113 , as is generally observed , and so the broad - line balmer decrement will steepen in low continuum states , and flatten in high states . moreover , @xmath04686 should be substantially more responsive ( @xmath114 ) than the balmer lines , and so large variations in the broad /h@xmath2 integrated flux ratio that are correlated with the continuum state can be expected , even in the absence of a varying continuum sed .",
    "3 .   a seyfert  1 galaxy s sub - classification as seyfert  1.0 , 1.5 , 1.8 , or 1.9 may at least in part be due to the relative flux of ionizing photons present within their broad - line regions at the time of observation .",
    "likewise , any given spectrum of a seyfert type  1 agn may pass through some of these sub - classifications as its continuum luminosity fluctuates from high ( seyfert  1 or 1.5 ) to low continuum states ( seyfert  1.8 or 1.9 ) .",
    "the emission - line responsivity , @xmath49 , places an additional important constraint on the run of physical conditions within the blr ( e.g. , gas density , column density , covering fraction ) as a function of radius over and above that of the line emissivity and lag .",
    "this is because for the optical recombination lines , the mean responsivity declines with increasing incident photon flux .",
    "thus , for a particular continuum luminosity state , a smaller emissivity - weighted radius is accompanied by a lower effective responsivity .",
    "greater responsivity in the optical recombination lines is expected during low continuum states , and lower responsivity is expected during high continuum states .",
    "the characteristic size of the blr as measured by the emission - line lag also will track the continuum luminosity level , a phenomenon known as `` breathing . ''",
    "responsivities that are functions of the continuum level and hence time result in non - stationary line transfer functions . in this case",
    "the time dependence is due to changes in the time - averaged photon flux incident on a spatially extended blr",
    ". the stronger response due to an elevated responsivity at low continuum levels will be enhanced by the greater coherence of an effectively smaller blr due to breathing .",
    "this time - dependence in the line transfer functions should also manifest itself in changes in the line profile widths , with the broad - line component becoming narrower / peakier in high continuum states .",
    "because the emissivities and responsivities of the optical recombination lines are anticorrelated with the incident continuum flux , observations that h@xmath3/h@xmath2 and h@xmath2/ flux ratios and the balmer line responsivity decrease from the core to the wings indicate that the blr velocity field diminishes with increasing distance from the central continuum source .",
    "these findings are consistent with recent reverberation studies that find a strong correlation between the emission - line lag and rms profile width for multiple lines in individual agns , which implies that the gas kinematics are dominated by the central massive object .",
    "larger variations in the balmer decrement with continuum state will be found in the broad - line cores rather than in the wings .",
    "observations of such would also indicate that the blr velocity field diminishes with increasing distance from the central continuum source .",
    "differences in broad - line widths ( whether rms or mean profile ) and lags among the balmer and helium recombination emission lines are in large part due to a radial ( continuum flux - dependent ) stratification of optical depth effects in these lines . 9 .   much of the observed behavior of the optical recombination lines ( e.g. , the weak response of the balmer line wings ) previously attributed to a substantial contribution from matter - bounded clouds at small blr radii ( i.e. , the so - called vblr ) may be explained by the photon flux dependencies of these lines emissivities and responsivities within ionization - bounded clouds .",
    "these findings should be general , largely independent of any specifically adopted model of the blr . however , the details of the optical recombination lines responsivities will be sensitive to and so diagnostic of specific physical conditions within the blrs of agns .",
    "in addition to the recombination lines investigated here , we suggest that studies of the ir paschen and bracket lines should prove fruitful in further constraining the blr , particularly in its outer regions .",
    "this paper benefited from the careful and critical review of an anonymous referee .",
    "we are grateful to gary ferland for maintaining his freely distributed code , cloudy .",
    "we thank the university of st.andrews and keith horne for their hospitality and support through a pparc visitors grant .",
    "we also thank keith for discussions of work in progress . m.r.g .",
    "would like to thank the hospitality and support of western michigan university during the completion of this work .",
    "appendix : sensitivity of emission line responsivity to model assumptions    we briefly discuss the point that most of the major trends in line responsivity reported here should not depend critically on the particular choice of model for the broad emission - line region . as discussed in @xmath4  2 ,",
    "most of these effects can be understood from figure  1 , which shows quite generally the dependence of an emission line s emissivity on cloud density and incident ionizing photon flux , irrespective of how these clouds ( or emitting entities ) are distributed or other details .",
    "korista et  al .  ( 1997 ) discusses and illustrates the effects of cloud column density on the line emissivities , and thus ew contours in figure  1 .",
    "the present simulations assume a constant cloud column density of @xmath12  @xmath13 . in general ,",
    "the computed integrated agn line spectrum is relatively insensitive to this parameter for column densities exceeding @xmath115  @xmath13 ( see also goad & koratkar 1998 ) , except for the high ionization lines of @xmath01034 and @xmath0774 , which require column densities @xmath116  @xmath13 and @xmath117  @xmath13 to fully form within the cloud ( korista et  al .",
    "1997 ; hamann et  al .",
    "1998 ) . to the extent that cloud column density has a significant effect on the luminosities or responsivities of the emission lines plotted in figure  1",
    ", the clouds must lie in the vicinity of the central diagonal boundary representing the steep downward gradient in ew ( i.e. , near @xmath118 )",
    ". these would be the clouds affected by the passage of an ionization front .",
    "if the preponderance of clouds have a smaller column density than those computed here , this _ diagonal _ boundary would shift toward the lower right corners of the density - flux planes in figure  1 . for higher column density clouds",
    ", this boundary would shift toward the upper left .",
    "the emissivities of clouds lying far from this boundary in the density - flux plane would be essentially unaffected .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure  3 of korista et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) . from figure  4 and eq .  2 in the present paper",
    ", it can therefore be seen that changing the cloud column density by an order of magnitude in either direction from the adopted value will not change the overall trends of the ew and responsivity of the ionization - bounded clouds being proportional to the incident continuum flux for the four emission lines studied here .",
    "because of their inefficient natures , matter - bounded clouds can not contribute substantially to the hydrogen recombination line luminosity ( or responsivity ) , unless they have much larger covering fractions than the optically thick clouds at the same radius .",
    "even then , their importance is likely to be minor , except perhaps in the extreme wings given a velocity field that declines with distance from the central source .",
    "different assumptions about the incident continuum sed or gas abundances do not change the line ew distributions in figure  1 very much ( see korista et  al .",
    "1997 ) , and so would have little effect on these lines responsivities .",
    "if the optical depths in the balmer lines were significantly reduced by the presence of large extra - thermal velocities that might occur in an accretion disk wind ( e.g. , murray & chiang 1997 ) , the result would be the ew contours in figure  1 peaking up at higher incident fluxes and densities and the balmer line - emitting region being more strongly influenced by gas with high responsivity ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "since the balmer lines have reported responsivities less than 1 even after correcting for geometric dilution , this would constrain models with large extra - thermal velocities and/or balmer emission from large outer radii . other consequences of significant extra - thermal velocities might be smaller predicted lags and broader predicted line profiles ( for a fixed central mass and incident continuum luminosity ) . if in general the radiative transfer of the balmer lines is currently less than adequately handled ( as may be the case ; see netzer et  al .",
    "1995 ) , the optical depth of h@xmath3 should nevertheless remain greater than that of h@xmath2 , and those of the helium lines should remain smaller than the balmer lines .",
    "thus , the relative senses of the ew contours of the balmer lines in figure  1 should be preserved .",
    "the sense of the balmer decrement variability as a function of continuum state should also be preserved , as should the h@xmath3/h@xmath2 intensity ratio across the line profile : _ provided that the bulk of the velocity field diminishes with increasing distance from the central source_.",
    "most of the extra responsivity in h@xmath2 over h@xmath3 in figure  7 lies within the line core whose contributions are dominated by gas lying ( and responding ) at larger distances . as a consequence , the difference in the measured lags of these two lines may not be as large as their ew distributions in figure  1 might indicate .",
    "that is , their responsivity - weighted radii may be closer in size than their emissivity - weighted radii ( goad et  al .",
    "in fact , depending on the actual emissivity and responsivity distributions of the two lines , it is possible for h@xmath2 to lag slightly behind h@xmath3 .",
    "in other words the total light profile may be broader in h@xmath2 than h@xmath3 and the other way around in the rms variation profile , with h@xmath3 having a slightly smaller lag .",
    "the small differences in the balmer lines beaming functions ( obrien et  al .",
    "1994 ) may also play a role in altering the relative responsivity - weighted radii , and thus relative lags of these emission lines .",
