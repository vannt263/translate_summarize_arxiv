    "in a large number of field theoretical problems one needs to consider quantum fields in backgrounds with boundaries .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on the field operator modify the spectrum of the zero - point fluctuations affecting the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of physical observables . among the most interesting manifestations of this influence",
    "is the casimir effect ( for reviews see @xcite ) . in 1948 , casimir showed that two neutral parallel conducting plates placed in the vacuum attract each other by the force inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance between them .",
    "the appearance of the force was explained as a consequence of the change in the spectrum for the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field caused by the presence of the plates . since the casimir s original paper , the vacuum forces acting on the boundaries confining quantum fields have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally for other boundary geometries and also for scalar and fermionic fields .",
    "similar effects arise in models with nontrivial spatial topology . in these models the boundary conditions imposed on the fields have topological origin .    among the most interesting directions in the theory of the casimir effect",
    "is its dependence on the geometry of the background spacetime .",
    "in particular , motivated by the possibility for the casimir forces to serve as a stabilization mechanism for the radion field in braneworld models , the investigation of the casimir effect in anti - de sitter spacetime has attracted a great deal of attention ( see , e.g. , references given in beze15ads ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider a problem with two types of the sources for the fermionic vacuum polarization .",
    "the first one is topological and is induced by the presence of straight cosmic string and the second one is induced by two parallel conical boundaries .",
    "the cosmic strings are among the most interesting topological defects resulting from the symmetry braking phase transitions in grand unified theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , they may have been created in the early universe and provide an important link between particle physics and cosmology .",
    "a variant of the formation mechanism for cosmic strings has been proposed in models of brane inflation @xcite . although the recent observational data on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbations , they are still candidates for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects .",
    "the latter include the gravitational lensing , the creation of small non - gaussianities in the cmb , the generation of gravitational waves , high - energy cosmic rays , and gamma ray bursts .",
    "the conical space appears also as an effective background geometry in the long - wavelength description of condensed matter systems such as crystals , liquid crystals and quantum liquids @xcite . among condensed matter realizations of the fermionic model in the conical bulk",
    "are graphene nanocones .",
    "the latter are obtained from planar graphene sheet if one or more sectors with the angle @xmath0 are excised and the remainder is joined @xcite .",
    "the long - wavelength excitations of the electronic subsystem in graphene are described by dirac - like theory with the fermi velocity playing the role of the speed of light . in the case of graphene",
    "nanocones the background geometry for this theory is conical .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the influence of the nontrivial topology due to the cosmic string on the fermionic casimir densities and the casimir force in the geometry of two parallel plates with the mit bag boundary condition . in order to have an exactly solvable problem",
    ", we will consider the idealized model for the straight cosmic string with flat spacetime everywhere except on the string where the curvature tensor has delta - type singularity . in this simplified model",
    "the exterior spacetime has a conical structure with the planar angle deficit related to the linear mass density . among the interesting physical effects of the corresponding nontrivial topology , widely discussed in the literature ,",
    "is the polarization of the vacuum for quantum fields ( see , for instance , references given in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , combined effects of the topology and boundaries in the geometry of the cosmic string have been considered as well .",
    "the analysis of the boundary - induced quantum effects in the cosmic string spacetime have been developed for scalar @xcite , fermionic beze08,beze10 , and electromagnetic fields @xcite in the geometry of a coaxial cylindrical boundary .",
    "the casimir force for a massless scalar fields subject to dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions in the setting of the conical piston has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the casimir densities for scalar and electromagnetic fields induced by flat boundaries perpendicular to the string were considered in beze11,beze12,beze13 .    as local characteristics of the fermionic vacuum we will consider the fermionic condensate and the vev of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the notion of the vacuum has a global nature and , as a consequence of this , these vevs carry an important information about the global properties of the background spacetime .",
    "the fermionic condensate plays a crucial role in the models of chiral symmetry breaking and in considerations of the stability of the fermionic vacuum @xcite .",
    "in addition to describing the local properties of the vacuum , the vev of the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source in semiclassical einstein equations and is required in modelling the self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we specify the bulk and boundary geometries and the boundary conditions imposed on the fermion field .",
    "the complete set of the positive- and negative - energy wavefunctions is presented . by making use of these modes , in section [ sec : fc ]",
    "we evaluate the fermionic condensate in the region between the plates .",
    "various asymptotic limits of the general expression are discussed .",
    "similar considerations for the vev of the energy - momentum tensor are presented in section [ sec : emt ] .",
    "the casimir forces acting on the plates are investigated in section [ sec : force ] .",
    "the main results are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "some details in the transformations of the components for the vacuum energy - momentum tensor are presented in appendix [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we start with the description of the bulk and boundary geometries under consideration .",
    "the background geometry is generated by an infinitely long straight cosmic string along the @xmath1 axis . in",
    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 the corresponding metric tensor reads @xmath3 .",
    "the difference from the minkowskian spacetime comes from the planar angle deficit @xmath4 for the azimuthal angle @xmath5 , @xmath6 . in the discussion below we",
    "will also use the parameter @xmath7 . in the weak - field approximation , one has the relation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the linear mass density on the string and @xmath10 is the newton gravitational constant .    for points outside the string core ,",
    "the local geometry generated by the cosmic string is flat and coincides with that for the minkowski spacetime .",
    "however , these two spacetimes have different global properties .",
    "the nontrivial topology coming from the cosmic string induces shifts in the vevs of physical observables for quantum fields .",
    "here we are interested in the influence of topology on the casimir effect for a quantum fermionic field @xmath11 in the geometry of two parallel plates perpendicular to the string axis .",

    "the models with boundary conditions induced by the compactification of the cosmic string along its axis have been considered in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the investigation of the combined effects of topology and boundaries on the fermion condensate and on the vev  of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these quantities are expressed in the form of the sums over complete set of fermionic modes obeying the boundary conditions ( [ bagcond ] ) .",
    "so , our first step will be the determination of the complete set of the fermionic wavefunctions in the region between the boundaries .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that , in the geometry of a single plate at @xmath32 , the positive - energy mode functions obeying the boundary condition ( bagcond ) on that plate are presented as @xmath33where @xmath34 is the bessel function , @xmath35 , @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 in ( [ psipos ] ) we have defined the functions@xmath42with @xmath43 and@xmath44 in ( [ psipos ] ) , @xmath45 stands for the set of quantum numbers specifying the mode functions ( see below ) .",

    "<S> we investigate combined effects of nontrivial topology , induced by a cosmic string , and boundaries on the fermionic condensate and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the energy - momentum tensor for a massive fermionic field . </S>",
    "<S> as geometry of boundaries we consider two plates perpendicular to the string axis on which the field is constrained by the mit bag boundary condition . by using the abel - plana type summation formula , </S>",
    "<S> the vevs in the region between the plates are decomposed into the boundary - free and boundary - induced contributions for general case of the planar angle deficit . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary - induced parts in both the fermionic condensate and the energy - momentum tensor vanish on the cosmic string . </S>",
    "<S> fermionic condensate is positive near the string and negative al large distances , whereas the vacuum energy density is negative everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> the radial stress is equal to the energy density . for a massless field </S>",
    "<S> , the boundary - induced contribution in the vev of the energy - momentum tensor is different from zero in the region between the plates only and it does not depend on the coordinate along the string axis . in the region between the plates and at large distances from the string , </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the topological part is exponential for both massive and massless fields . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in contrast to that for the vev of the energy - momentum tensor in the boundary - free geometry with the power law decay for a massless field . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum pressure on the plates is inhomogeneous and vanishes at the location of the string . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding casimir forces are attractive .    </S>",
