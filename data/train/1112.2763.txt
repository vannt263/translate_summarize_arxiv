    "since kuramoto introduced a mathematical model of coupled nonlinear oscillators  @xcite by refining the earlier winfree s model  @xcite to be more mathematically tractable , it has become a minimal model for collective synchronization phenomena , which are ubiquitous in real systems ranging from physics to biology .",
    "the original kuramoto model is very simple but exhibits lots of rich behaviors including a synchronization transition , where all the oscillators phases are tuned by the coupling strength against the diversity of natural frequencies , and eventually reach a phase - locked state ( frequency entrainment ) including in - phase synchronization with exactly the same value ( see  @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "synchronization is a quite interesting nonlinear phenomenon , which can yield a dynamic phase transition against the coupling strength among weakly coupled oscillators for a given natural frequency distribution . above the coupling strength threshold ,",
    "oscillators become partially phase - locked , which is called partial synchronization .",
    "the existence of partially phase - locked solutions and their stability were studied by kuramoto  @xcite and crawford  @xcite , respectively . as an extension of the aforementioned works , aeyels and rogge addressed the stability issue for networks of a finite number of oscillators  @xcite , and mirollo and strogatz analyzed the linear stability of phase - locked states for globally coupled kuramoto oscillators  @xcite .",
    "later on , lots of phase models have been proposed to describe the dynamic behavior of large populations of nonlinearly coupled oscillators .",
    "furthermore , it has also been widely discussed that the nature of synchronization transitions for the continuum version of the original kuramoto model is subject to the shape of the natural frequency distribution function .",
    "while the synchronization transition has been widely discussed from the physical point of view , the strict shape of phase - locked states has not drawn much less attention because it concerns far from the transition .",
    "of course , the transition is one of the interesting topics to be studied in many senses , such as critical behaviors and its universality issue .",
    "however , it is mostly restricted to numerical studies , which implies that there are always some technical difficulties to reach a correct conclusion without rigorous mathematical guidelines and/or proofs . in that sense",
    ", it is meaningful if we can report what and how can be mathematically proven in the perspective of relevant aspects directly and indirectly to major interests for a given model before proceeding numerical studies near and at the transition .    in this paper , we address the modified kuramoto model with finite inertia and take an interest with the details of phase - locked states in order to handle the shape of phase - locked states as well as their uniqueness issue for a fixed distribution of natural frequencies .",
    "consider an ensemble of finite number of kuramoto oscillators with finite inertia .",
    "let @xmath1 be the phase of the @xmath2-th oscillator and @xmath3 denotes the strength of uniform inertia acting on kuramoto oscillators .",
    "in this situation , the dynamics of @xmath4 is governed by the initial valule problem of second - order odes : @xmath5 subject to initial phase - frequency configuration : @xmath6 without loss of generality , we assume that the average of natural frequencies is zero : @xmath7 the system was first introduced by ermentrout  @xcite as a phenomenological model to explain the slow synchronization of certain biological systems , e.g. , fireflies of the pteroptyx malaccae , and this model has been used to describe various dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "the whole review and mathematical results for the kuramoto model can be found in  @xcite . in the earlier study , the first author and his collaborators  @xcite",
    "have verified that for some classes of initial configurations and @xmath8 , the speed to the phase - locked states is slower than that of the original kuramoto model ( without the inertial term ) , which illustrates the slow relaxation of kuramoto oscillators .",
    "the main novelty of this paper is to provide a simple proof for the nonlinear stability of some classes of phase - locked states in globally coupled kuramoto oscillators with finite inertia . using the robust @xmath0-norm",
    ", we present the proof under the suitable conditions on initial phase - frequency configurations , coupling strengths , and finite inertia .",
    "it is noted that phase - locked states are orbitally @xmath0-stable , which results in the uniqueness of phase - locked states .",
