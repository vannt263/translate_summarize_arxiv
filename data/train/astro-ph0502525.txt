    "the latter changes the mass function on short and long timescales - making it extremely difficult to measure the imf .",
    "careful studies taking mass segregation into account often find salpeter indices in young clusters ( e.g. in the lmc and smc , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore a salpeter imf is found in very young clusters such as the star - burst cluster r136 in the lmc @xcite , ngc  1805 @xcite , ngc  2004 , ngc  2100 @xcite and m82-f @xcite .",

    "furthermore , about 40% of o stars and 5 - 10% of b stars are run - away stars most probably ejected from star - forming regions @xcite and found up to several kpc away from their birth places . obviously such stars need to be included in order to reconstruct an imf from a present - day mass function ( pdmf ) which has not been done . but also stars evaporating from a cluster after gas expulsion would travel 100 to 500 pc for clusters that are 100 to 500 myr old even if they leave only with a velocity of 1 @xmath10 !",
    "thus , dynamical modelling on a cluster - to - cluster basis would be needed to affirm possible non - salpeter imfs above @xmath11 .",
    "so the case may be made that the imf differs from cluster to cluster @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of any trends with physical conditions together with the gaussian distribution about the salpeter value above @xmath12 and the similar , although somewhat larger theoretical spread obtained for model clusters ( fig .",

    "in addition to using our default canonical salpeter imf above @xmath11 , we also construct models with @xmath13 to account for a possibly steeper - than - salpeter universal imf above @xmath11 .     above 2.5 @xmath7 for an ensemble of clusters and associations in the mw , the lmc and smc .",

    "below roughly 100 stars ( @xmath31 ) embedded clusters dissolve within a few myr @xcite but for our model only the initial distribution of @xmath24 is of interest , not the evolution of the clusters .",
    "the detailed distribution of such small systems is not well known .",
    "observational and theoretical evidence is contradictory as @xcite conclude that they are not major contributors to the field , while @xcite suggest that 90% of star - formation takes place in such small systems .",
    "this would be roughly equivalent to a power - law function with @xmath32 down to about 5 @xmath7 which corresponds to a group of about 20 stars . from a careful study of 580 open clusters in the milky way @xcite",

    "they are able to fit a power - law cluster mass function as steep as @xmath33 to the distribution down to a cluster mass of a few solar masses .",
    "65% of the clusters in their sample have reconstructed masses less than @xmath34 .",
    "they also conclude that 80% of newly formed open clusters will dissolve in less than 20 myr .",
    "a universality of the ecmf slope is not an established result as a number of works based on hii - region luminosity functions @xcite , direct cluster counts @xcite and gmc counts @xcite indicate that it may vary with galaxy - type or even rather erratically .",
    "the situation may be resolved once early cluster evolution is taken into account in more detail ; @xcite have already made the important point that the cluster mf evolves rapidly within the first few @xmath35 yr as a result of re - virialisation after significant residual - gas expulsion .    under the assumption that ( i ) the stellar imf is universal and canonical and ( ii ) that the ecmf is also universal , we showed in @xcite that the integrated galaxial initial stellar mass function ( igimf ) must be steeper than the individual canonical imfs in the actual clusters . but this steepening is critically dependent on the assumptions regarding the low - mass end of the ecmf .    in this contribution",
    "we develop a tool to calculate the time - depended igimf for different types of galaxies .",
    "this is possible by combining the above mentioned results with a recently discovered relation between the maximum cluster mass formed in a star - formation epoch and the star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "the varying star formation histories ( sfhs ) of galaxies therefore leave their fingerprint in the distribution of the stellar content and the resulting chemical evolution of galaxies through a highly variable imf .",
    "however , this ought to be difficult to observe because variations of the sfr also imply changes of the relative number of young and old stars , even for an invariant igimf .",
    "in the next section (  [ sec : meth ] ) we introduce the method of calculating the igimf from a universal imf , an ecmf and a star formation history ( sfh ) , before we present the results in  [ sec : res ] , where we construct standard , maximal and minimal models that span the range of parameters characterizing the stellar imf and the ecmf .",
    "the results are discussed in  [ sec : conc ] . before proceeding we note that throughout this paper imf means the stellar imf which we take to be invariant .",
    "in @xcite we derived a relation between the maximal cluster mass in a galaxy and the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of the galaxy , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass - to - light ratio , typically 0.0144 for young ( @xmath38 6 myr ) clusters .",
    "this relation connects the properties of clustered star formation with the sfr of a galaxy . of interest for investigating",
    "the sensitivity of the results on the sfr is also the use of a relation which is steeper than the default eq .",

    "[ eq : meclsfr ] can be reproduced theoretically for a power - law ecmf provided the entire population of star clusters with masses ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath40 is born within a time - span of @xmath42  myr , independently of the sfr .",
    "we refer to this time - span as a `` star - formation epoch '' of a galaxy .",
    "as these epochs are very short and the clusters fade quickly , a constant @xmath37 can be chosen and the ecmf and the resulting igimf can be determined within each epoch .",
    "we note that we differentiate between an embedded cluster that contains the entire stellar population formed in one molecular cloud core , while on the other hand the `` initial cluster mf '' has been introduced as a theoretical construct arrived at by mapping present - day cluster masses backwards in time using classical n - body evolution tracks that do not take into account violent virialisation owing to gas expulsion @xcite .",
    "thus , @xcite derive an initial cluster mf in the local mw disk with a steeper slope ( @xmath43 ) than @xmath44 suggested by local surveys of very young embedded clusters @xcite .",
    "the de la fuente initial cluster mf is likely to be biased towards smaller masses .",

    "alternatively , the scalo value may reflect a steeper igimf @xcite .",
    "we use both , the canonical salpeter @xmath51 and the scalo value .",
    "the cluster mass in stars is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the adopted minimum mass given by opacity - limited fragmentation while @xmath54 is the maximum stellar mass that can occur in the cluster .",
    "apart from not well understood physical reasons @xcite , it can not be arbitrarily high because the cluster mass sets limits on its value .",

[ fig : maxmasfr ] allow the construction of igimfs without the need to perform the detailed modelling described in this paper .",
    "it is important to note here that the sfrs in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxmasfr ] are not the averaged sfrs of the galaxy but the sfrs during the star - formation epoch .",
    "thus , for example , a galaxy with @xmath138 produced continuously over 1  gyr has the same sfr of @xmath139 and the same igimf and @xmath116 as a galaxy with @xmath140 produced continuously over 14  gyr . in order to get the complete stellar population of a galaxy the igimf slope of each star - formation epoch of the sfh has to be calculated , resulting in a series of populations , each with its own @xmath141",

    "* ) , the limit declines for lower sfrs .",

    "we show that it is possible to explain varying stellar populations in galaxies by a simple mechanism based on universal principles for all galaxies .",
    "our assumptions are ( i ) that all stars are born in clusters following a universal embedded cluster mass function which is populated up to a maximum cluster mass which depends on the star formation rate of a galaxy , and ( ii ) that within these clusters all stars are born from a universal stellar imf .",
    "but the magnitude of the effect strongly depends on the shape of the ecmf for low - mass clusters .",
    "the combination of a varying sfr with the empirical @xmath143 relation , together with the stellar mass being limited by the cluster mass , naturally leads to a time - dependent integrated galaxial initial stellar mass function .",
    "this igimf also depends on the mass of the galaxy by virtue of the average level of the sfr being proportional to @xmath144 .",
    "the steep igimf and the variations  especially for dwarf galaxies  may have implications for the chemo - dynamical evolution of galaxies .",
    "but we note that this effect occurs in addition to standard ( i.e. imf - invariant ) variations of the relative number of young and old populations as a result of varying sfrs , making the empirical detection of igimf variations challenging .",
    "we document in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxmasfr ] all quantities needed to construct , without additional computation , igimfs for galaxies of all morphological types and for a standard , a maximal and a minimal scenario .",
    "this ought to be useful for future chemo - dynamical research within a hierarchical cosmological structure formation scenario .",
    "in summary , given our assumptions the most important conclusions are :    * chemical enrichment histories and sn rates calculated with an invariant salpeter imf may not be correct for any galaxy ; * the number of supernovae is lower , and possibly significantly lower over cosmological times than for an invariant canonical imf ; * irrespective of how old a galaxy is it will always appear less chemically evolved than a more massive equally - old galaxy as a result of the steeper igimf ; * the scatter in chemical properties must increase with decreasing galaxy mass ; * a steeper ( input ) imf above @xmath2 would aggravate the systematic differences in galaxy properties when compared to a salpeter imf as well as increasing the variations with galaxy mass ;    where galaxy mass refers only to the assembled mass in stars .    of future interest would be a direct observational test of this model .",
    "this may be possible by using deep luminosity functions of nearby galaxies .",
    "but these functions will reflect the pdmf so that stellar evolution and the sfh need to be taken into account in order to extract the igimf .",
    "the difficulty associated with such work is seen by several studies of starburst galaxies having found ( ig)imfs truncated at the lower mass end near a few @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but more recent studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) showed that this seems not to be the case . in the same paper elmegreen points out that a salpeter imf with a flattening below about 0.5  1 @xmath7 gives a good approximation for starburst galaxies .",
    "this does not necessarily contradict our result of a variable galaxy - wide igimf , as the observable part of the igimf in a starburst galaxy is dominated by a few young and massive clusters for which we adopt a salpeter imf in the high mass range . in our model variations come from the fainter less - massive clusters .",
    "it should be noted here that for the more conservative approach of the minimal scenario our results still predict considerable differences in comparison with a constant canonical imf .",
    "for example , @xcite make assumptions rather similar to our minimal scenario and predict a reduction of the general metal yield by a factor of about 1.8 .",
