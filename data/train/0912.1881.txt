    "the discovery of giant magnetoteresistance in 1998 by the groups of fert and grnberg led to new reading heads for hard disks @xcite . moreover for the first time , a device based on magnetic phenomena replaced a conventional electronics device based on the movement of the electrons charge and thus opened the way to the field of spintronics or magnetoelectronics .",
    "the aim is to replace conventional electronics with new devices where magnetism plays a central role leading to smaller energy consumption .",
    "several architectures have been proposed @xcite but only in 2009 dash and collaborators managed to inject spin - polarized current from a metallic electrode into si , which is a key issue in current research in this field . showing that spintronic devices can be incorporated into conventional electronics @xcite .    in order to maximize the efficiency of spintronic devices ,",
    "the injected current should have as high spin - polarization as possible @xcite .",
    "to this respect half - metallic compounds have attracted a lot of interest ( for a review see reference @xcite ) .",
    "these alloys are ferromagnets where the majority spin channel is metallic while the minority - spin band structure is that of a semiconductor leading to 100%spin - polarization of the electrons at the fermi level and thus to possibly 100%  spin - polarized current into a semiconductor when half metals are employed as the metallic electrode .",
    "the term half - metal was initially used by de groot et al in the case of the nimnsb heusler alloy @xcite .",
    "ab - initio ( also known as first - principles ) calculations have been widely used to explain the properties of these alloys and to predict new half - metallic compounds .",
    "an interesting case is the transition - metal pnictides like cras and mnas .",
    "akinaga and collaborators found in 2000 that when a cras thin film is grown on top of a zinc - blende semiconductor like gaas , the metallic film adopts the lattice of the substrate and it crystallizes in a meta - stable half - metallic zinc - blende phase @xcite structure .",
    "later cras was successfully synthesized in the zinc - blence structure in the form of multilayers with gaas @xcite and other successful experiments include the growth of zinc - blende mnas in the form of dots @xcite and crsb in the form of films @xcite .",
    "experiments agree with predictions of ab - initio calculations performed by several groups @xcite . in the case of the half - metallic ferromagnets like cras or crse",
    ", the gap in the minority - spin band arises from the hybridization between the @xmath0-states of the @xmath1 atom and the triple - degenerated @xmath2 states of the transition - metal and as a result the total spin - moment , @xmath3 , follows the slater - pauling ( sp ) behavior being equal in @xmath4 to @xmath5 where @xmath6 the total number of valence electrons in the unit cell @xcite .",
    "recently theoretical works have appeared attacking also some crucial aspects of these alloys like the exchange bias in ferro-/antiferromagnetic interfaces @xcite , the stability of the zinc - blende structure @xcite , the dynamical correlations @xcite , the interfaces with semiconductors @xcite , the exchange interaction @xcite , the emergence of half - metallic ferrimagnetism @xcite and the temperature effects @xcite . an extended overview on the properties of these alloys can be found in reference @xcite .     of the lattice constant .",
    "note that in the case of the cras / cdse we have two non - equivalent interfaces : ( i ) when the sequence of the atoms is ... -cr - as - cd- ... denoted as cras / cdse-1 and ( ii ) when the sequence is ... -cr - se - cd- ... denoted as cras / cdse-2 .",
    "finally we should note that we have assumed the lattice constant of the two semiconductors ( 0.606 nm ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table6 ]",
    "finally , in the last section we will present our results concerning the case of in , for the cras / inas interface , and cd , for both cras / cdse interfaces , impurities at various sites .",
    "all three interfaces show similar behavior and thus in figure [ fig9 ] we present the dos for all possible in impurities for the cras / inas multilayer .",
    "we should note that with respect to the conservation of the half - metallicity this is the most interesting case since for the other two cras / cdse interfaces the half - metallic character is conserved for all cases under study . in table",
    "[ table6 ] we have gathered the atom - resolved spin moments for all cases under study and as it can be easily deduced from the table the variation of the spin moments for the same position of the in(cd ) impurity is similar for all three interfaces and thus we will restrict our discussion to the cras / inas case .    .",
    "[ fig9 ] ]    we expect that the most frequent case to occur would be the in impurity at the cr site since such an impurity does not disrupt the zinc - blende structure . in atoms have only two valence electrons occupying the deep - energy - lying @xmath7-states and thus for the energy window which we examine the @xmath0-states , which we observe , have their origin at the nearest as neighbors whose @xmath0-states penetrate in the in sites ( cd has only one valence @xmath7-electron ) .",
    "thus the in impurity acts similarly to a void , although it does not lead to such large reorganization of the charge of the neighboring atoms , leading to slightly larger spin moment of the neighboring atoms with respect to the perfect interfaces as shown in table [ table6 ] . due to the small weight of the in @xmath0-states",
    "we have multiplied the corresponding dos with a factor 5 or 10 in figure [ fig9 ] to make it visible . with respect to the case of void impurity at the cr site , here",
    "the shift of the bands of the nearest - neighboring as atoms is smaller keeping the half - metallic character of the interface although the gap is considerably shrinking .",
    "when the in impurity is located at the void1 site , the disturbance of the lattice is smaller with respect to the case just presented , although both cr and void1 sites have the same nearest - neighbors and as shown in figure [ fig9 ] the width of the gap remains unchanged . due to",
    "the negligible weight of the in @xmath0 states also the occurrence of in impurities at void2 and void3 sites leads to a slight variation of the spin moments but the half - metallicity is preserved and the gap retains a large width . to conclude we should discuss also the case of in impurities at as sites .",
    "as atoms at the interface have two cr atoms as nearest neighbors and the hybridization between the as @xmath0- and cr @xmath2-orbitals is strong .",
    "the substitution of an as atom by an in one leads to reduced hybridization for the cr orbitals and cr atoms at the interface regain the charge participating at the bonds with the missing as atom .",
    "this extra charge is accommodated at the cr spin - up states leading to larger spin magnetic moments of the cr atoms at the interface which now are about 3.59 @xmath4 instead of 3.25 @xmath4 in the case of the perfect cras / inas interface presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the in impurity atom and its nearest - neighboring in atoms have states within the gap , as shown in figure [ fig9 ] but if we take into account that we have multiplied the in dos by 10 their real weight at the fermi level is negligible with respect to the cr majority - spin dos .",
    "thus we can safely consider that the half - metallicity is conserved although as shown by the cr dos , the gap in the minority - spin band seriously shrinks and the fermi level is near the right edge of the gap .",
    "we have studied using the korringa - kohn - rostoker method the appearance of single impurities at interfaces between the half - metallic ferromagnet cras and the binary inas and cdse semiconductors . in the case of bulk cras studied in reference",
    "@xcite we had shown that most impurities affect the half - metallic character of cras inducing states either at the edges of the gap or in the middle of the gap .",
    "but multilayers are very thin as experiments show @xcite and thus we can not use the impurity calculations for the bulk to discuss the case of interfaces .",
    "we have studied al possible single impurities at the interfaces .",
    "contrary to the bulk systems almost all defects were not affecting the half - metallic character of the perfect interfaces .",
    "the only exception were void impurities at cr or in(cd ) sites .",
    "the missing cr or in(cd ) atom leads to a reorganization of the charge of the surrounding atoms and as a result the @xmath0 bands of the nearest neighboring as(se ) atom shift to higher energies crossing the fermi level and leading to loss of the half - metallicity .",
    "this is the opposite behavior that the one exhibited by the void impurities at cr site in the bulk cras alloy where the dos remained almost unchanged @xcite .",
    "the different behavior of the void impurities should be attributed to the lower dimensionality of the interfaces with respect to the bulk .",
    "but void impurities are schottky - type and we expect them to exhibit high formation energies and thus their number should be small in the experimental systems .",
    "thus contrary to the bulk cras and eventually thick films showing a bulk - like behavior , impurities are expected to affect only marginally the half - metallic character of the interfaces in the case of thin multilayers and the latter ones are promising for spintronic devices .",
