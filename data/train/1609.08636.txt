    "the _ kepler _ mission has discovered from its first 16 months data over @xmath1 planetary candidates @xcite .",
    "over one third ( @xmath2800 ) of these candidates are in multiple transiting candidate planetary systems , and one remarkable feature of them , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , is that the vast majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low - order mean motion resonance ( mmr hereafter , see also in @xcite ) , however there are small but significant excesses / deficits of candidate pairs slightly wider / narrow of the exact resonance ( or nominal resonance center ) , particularly near the first order mmr , such as 2:1 and 3:2 mmr .    such an intriguing asymmetric period ratio distribution has stimulated a number of theorists recently , who developed different models to understand and interpret it .",
    "@xcite consider that such an asymmetric period ratio distribution around mmr could be an outcome of resonant couples having underwent eccentricity damping during some dissipative evolutions , such as tidal dissipation ( see also in @xcite ) . on the other side , @xcite attempts to interpret it as a result of the combination of stochastic and smooth planet migrations .    beside and before the _ kepler _ transit survey ,",
    "many near mmr planets had been found by various radial velocity ( rv hereafter ) surveys .",
    "as we will show below ( section [ dis_rv ] ) , similar , if not exactly the same , features of the period ratio distributions seen in _ kepler _ planets , have been also shown in rv planets .",
    "one question is how all these features / clues in both the _ kepler _ and rv samples could be understood systematically in a common context .",
    "this paper is such an attempt and it is organized as the following .",
    "we first analytically study the dynamics of planets near / in mmr in section [ sec_analytic ] , and confirm the analytical results with numerical simulations in section [ sec_numerical ] .",
    "we find that planets orbital distribution could be asymmetric around the mmr center under certain conditions .",
    "we then discuss its implications to _ kepler _ and rv planets in section [ dis ] .",
    "finally , we summarize this paper in section [ sum ] . some analytical derivations are also given in the appendix a and b as supplementary .",
    "we note that @xcite posted their paper to arxiv.org just a few days before submitting this paper , which , independently and in a different way , arrived at many of the results presented in this paper .",
    "we study the orbital evolutions of two planets ( orbiting a central star ) near / in first order mmr . as we will show below",
    ", the orbit distribution could be asymmetric near the mmr center under certain circumstances .        for simplicity , we assume both planets orbits are coplanar .",
    "the total energy , or hamiltonian , is @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gravity constant , @xmath5 is the stellar mass , and following @xcite , the disturbing function due to the @xmath6 resonance is @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the two resonance angles for @xmath9 hereafter , we adopt the convention that properties with subscripts `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' belong to the inner and outer planets respectively . in the above , \\{@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 }",
    "are the mass and standard orbital elements for planets . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are relevant laplace coefficients , which are on order of unity and tabulated in @xcite and @xcite .    using the lagrange s planetary equation ( on the lowest order terms in @xmath12 )",
    ", we derive the evolutions of planets semi major axes and eccentricities , @xmath17 @xmath18 where , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mean motion of the inner and outer planets respectively .    using equation [ edot ] to eliminate @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we can rewrite equation [ adot0 ] as @xmath23 which integrate to give @xmath24 where we have defined @xmath25 we note equations [ adot1 ] or [ const1 ] are equivalent to the well known constants of motion in resonance ( see appendix a ) .",
    "a worth noting implication of equation [ adot1 ] or [ const1 ] is that if planet pairs initially formed with circular orbit near mmr , they will shift to a little bit larger orbital period ratio as their eccentricities are excited , inducing an asymmetric orbit distribution near mmr ( see numerical confirmation in section [ sec_numerical ] ) .",
    "using equation [ adot1 ] , this small shift extent in period ratio ( @xmath26 ) can be estimated as @xmath27 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to @xcite ( see their eqn .",
    "8.209 and 8.210 ) , the maximum eccentricity increase in @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( or critical eccentricities ) are @xmath30 setting @xmath31 and @xmath32 , then equation [ dp1 ] will give an estimate of the largest asymmetric shift of period ratio .",
    "dissipation processes ( e.g. , tidal evolution , disk migration ) may play an import role during planet formation and evolution .",
    "generally they cause changing on planets orbital semi major axes and damping in eccentricities . to include these effects , we consider the following changing / damping terms ( i.e. , inverse of the damping timescales ) of semi major axes and eccentricities , @xmath33 where ( hereafter ) @xmath34 for the inner and outer planets respectively .",
    "note , @xmath35 could be negative , which indicates outward migration , and @xmath36 is generally positive , i.e. , eccentricity is damped in dissipation process .",
    "following @xcite ( see the appendix b for the derivation ) , the evolutions of the semi major axes of two planets ( after adding above damping terms ) are .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proximity to the nominal resonance center , and thus its evolution follows , @xmath39    if @xmath40 , then @xmath41 will be always positive , namely the two planets will always keep divergent migration , i.e. , their period ratio will always increase .",
    "this is the case if the planetary system undergoes tidal evolution @xcite .",
    "if @xmath42 otherwise , then there is an stable equilibrium with @xmath43^{1/2 } , \\label{deq }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] wider / narrower than which , the two planets will undergo convergent / divergent migration , thus eventually they will be locked at @xmath44 .",
    "interestingly , the above equation can be roughly written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the typical planet - star mass ratio of the system and @xmath47 is the well known model parameter describing the ratio between the damping rate of orbital eccentricity and that of semimajor axis . from equation ( [ deq2 ] )",
    ", we see that the theoretical parameter @xmath0 is linked to an observable @xmath48 .",
    "we will discuss this more in section [ dis_rv ] .",
    "for comparison against the above analytical results , we perform some 3-body ( 1 star + 2 planets ) simulations using the well - tested n - body integrator mercury @xcite .",
    "for all the simulations , the central star is set with a mass @xmath49 , and all angular orbital elements , except for orbital inclinations , are initially randomly set . for most simulations , the semi major axis of the inner planet",
    "is set at 0.1 au if not specified .      from equations",
    "[ adot1]-[dp1 ] , we expect that planets orbits have an asymmetric distribution near the mmr center . here",
    ", we numerically show such an asymmetry and its dependence on the initial period ratio , orbital eccentricities , inclinations and planetary masses .",
    "figure [ fig_asym ] shows the orbital evolutions of two equal mass ( @xmath50 ) planets initially with circular and coplanar orbits but different orbital ratios .",
    "planets semimajor axes and eccentricities follow periodical oscillations , and their period ratios increase with eccentricities as expected from equation [ adot1 ] . on average the planets spend more time on orbits wider than the initial ones , causing an asymmetric distribution in their period ratio .",
    "the asymmetry become weaker as the planet pair is further away from mmr .",
    "however , the most prominent asymmetric feature is not realized at the mmr center but at a little bit narrower than the center .",
    "the reason is that planets eccentricities get most excited when they are at the separatrix which is at narrower than the nominal resonance center for the first order mmr @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_ecc ] shows how the asymmetry is affected by the initial orbital eccentricities . as expected from equation [ adot1 ] , if the eccentricity is initially larger , then it will have larger possibility ( compared to the case of zero initial eccentricity ) to decrease in the future , thus the period ratio will become more symmetric around the initial one .",
    "the critical eccentricity , greater than which the asymmetry will be very weak , could be estimated using equation [ ecr ] , which is consistent with the numerical results and the results within the context of the restricted 3-body problem @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_mas ] shows the effect of planetary mass on the asymmetry . as expected from equation [ adot1]-[ecr ] , increasing mass leading to larger eccentricity excitation and thus larger period ratio shift extent .",
    "roughly , systems with similar total masses ( regardless of mass ratio ) have similar shift extents .    figure [ fig_inc ] shows the role of relative inclination @xmath51 in the asymmetry .",
    "generally the asymmetry becomes very weak for @xmath52 .",
    "this is not surprised , as the above analytical studies are all based on an assumption of low @xmath51 . for large @xmath51 , more terms ( e.g. , on the oder of @xmath53 )",
    "should be considered in the disturbing function in equation [ rj ] , and in such cases , planets could be involved in second order of mmr , which is symmetric around nominal resonance center @xcite .",
    "the case of divergent migration ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) has been studied recently in detail recently by @xcite . here we focus on the other case where @xmath55 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath56 , and damping is only added on the outer planet with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the two planets are started at 0.2 and 0.35 au respectively with an initial orbital period @xmath59 .",
    "we study 7 different k values from 0 to 10000 and 3 different planetary mass sets .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ fig_mig ] .",
    "the left 4 panels of figure [ fig_mig ] plot the results of one simulation with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the out planet moves inward and captures into 2:1 mmr with the inner planet at about @xmath62 d. after that , the two planets still moving inward together but with resonance angles , eccentricities and period ratios reaching a relatively stable state .",
    "the orbital period ratio at the later state is asymmetric around the nominal mmr center , and the its mean value is roughly consistent with the analytical estimate from equation [ deq ] .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig_mig ] shows how @xmath48 depends on planetary mass and damping ratio @xmath0 .",
    "generally we see that @xmath48 is proportional to planetary mass and increases with @xmath0 .",
    "not surprised , the analytical predictions are consistent with the numerical simulations only for relative large @xmath48 and @xmath0 ( see appendix b ) . for low @xmath0 values ( @xmath63 )",
    ", @xmath48 do not approach zero but become a positive constant which is proportional to planetary mass .",
    "such a tiny constant @xmath48 may reflect the intrinsic asymmetry of the mmr .",
    "however , we note that here the constant @xmath48 is much smaller than the maximum asymmetry estimated by equations [ dp1 ] and [ ecr ] , which is reasonable because large eccentricity leads to weak asymmetry as seen in figure [ fig_ecc ] .",
    "the period ratio distribution of _ kepler _ multiple planet candidate systems show an intriguing asymmetric feature near mmr , especially for 2:1 and 3:2 mmr , namely there are small deficits / excesses just a little bit narrow / wide of the nominal mmr center @xcite . to interpret such an asymmetric feature ,",
    "@xcite consider that it could be a result of planets undergoing some dissipative evolution , such as tidal dissipation .",
    "in such a case , as discussed in section [ dissipation1 ] , @xmath64 , thus the planet period will always increase . to quantitively explain the observed asymmetric period ratio distribution",
    ", one needs to put a right amount of dissipation on them .",
    "in addition , as tidal effect is only efficient for short period planet , e.g. , less 10 days , one needs to resort to other dissipations at larger orbital period where the observed asymmetry is still significant . @xcite",
    "then considers if the observed period ratio is consistent with the scenario of planets migrating in disks .",
    "first , he considers smooth migration and finds that the excess or pileup of planet pairs is too large and too close to the mmr center .",
    "his result is expected from our analytical results in figure [ fig_mig ] and equation [ deq ] , which shows @xmath65 ( 2 order of magnitude lower than the observed one ) if assuming a typical _ kepler _ planet mass on order of 10 @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "nevertheless , he further shows that by including certain amount stochastic forces due to disk turbulence during migration , the large pileup at mmr center could be smeared out and a period ratio distribution similar to that of _ kepler _ planets could be reproduced .",
    "all the above attempts belong to the case with dissipation . as we have shown",
    "( section [ nod1 ] and [ nod2 ] ) , the period ratio distribution is intrinsically asymmetric near the mmr center even if there is no dissipation . in order to see whether and how the intrinsic asymmetry can reproduce _ kepler _ planets period ratio distribution , we perform the following n - body simulations . specifically , we draw 4000 planets pairs initially with a uniform period ratio distribution near mmr , rayleigh eccentricity and inclination distributions , and uniformly random distribution for all the other angular orbital elements .",
    "we use the mercury integrator to simulate these 4000 systems individually on a timescale of @xmath68 days and intensively output their period ratio very 200 days .",
    "the final period ratio distribution is calculated with these output period ratios of all 4000 systems . as _ kepler _",
    "multiple planet systems are believed to be highly coplanar within a few degree @xcite , we assume the mean inclination @xmath69 . for simplicity , we only study equal mass pairs , i.e , @xmath70 because different mass ratios lead to similar results as long as their total masses are the same ( fig.[fig_mas ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig_obs ] compares the observed period ratio distribution to those from above simulations with different planetary masses from @xmath50 to @xmath71 and mean eccentricities from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "the simulated period ratio distributions have an asymmetric feature resembling the observation , i.e. , a trough / pile up just a little bit narrow / wide of mmr center . as expected ( fig.[fig_ecc ] and [ fig_mas ] ) , the asymmetric feature become weaker with increasing eccentricity and more extended with increasing mass . in order to reproduce the observed period ratio distribution",
    ", it requires a mean eccentricity less than a few percents and planetary mass about 10 - 20 @xmath66 for 3:2 mmr and @xmath74 for 2:1 mmr .",
    "the eccentricity requirement is consistent with recent eccentricity estimate with transit timing variation @xcite . as for the typical mass of _ kepler _ planets ,",
    "it is expected to be 4 - 9 @xmath66 given the typical radii of 2 - 3 @xmath75 and a mass radio distribution either based on fitting of the solar system , @xmath76 @xcite , or transit timing variation , @xmath77 @xcite . even considering a relatively large uncertain of mass measurements , say 100% , such an expected mass is still too low to meet the requirement for 2:1 mmr , although it is comparable to the mass requirement for 3:2 mmr . therefore , we conclude that the intrinsic mmr asymmetry ( without any damping ) could partially explain _ kepler _ planets asymmetric period ratio distribution near 3:2 mmr but not 2:1 mmr . for the latter , other mechanisms , e.g. , dissipation , should play a more important role .      at the time of writing this paper ,",
    "there are 409 exoplanets detected with radial velocity ( rv ) method ( exoplanet.org ) and about @xmath78 of them reside in multiple planet systems .",
    "these rv planets have a wide mass range featured with a bimodal distribution @xcite as shown in the left panel of figure[fig_rvobs ] .",
    "the boundary is at about 0.2 @xmath79 , which separate the light rv planets ( with a media mass of @xmath80 ) and the massive ones ( with a media mass of @xmath81 ) .",
    "this bimodal distribution may indicate planets undergo different formations and evolutions for the light and massive groups @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that these two groups may have different period ratio distributions . as shown in the right panels of figure [ fig_rvobs ] , there is a strong pileup of planet pairs near 2:1 mmr in the massive planet group , which is not seen in the light group .",
    "those massive planets piled up near 2:1 mmr seems unlikely formed in situ within a small annulus , but they are more likely formed with larger distance in a disk then brought into 2:1 mmr through convergent migration .",
    "interestingly , we note that the pile up is just a few percent ( in period ratio ) wide of the 2:1 mmr center , which is expected from our analytical and numerical prediction with planetary migration ( e.g. , fig.[fig_mig ] ) . furthermore , from the location of the pileup ( i.e. , @xmath48 )",
    ", we can infer the damping ratio between eccentricity and semi major axis during planetary migration ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) by using equation [ deq ] .",
    "the result of such an exercise is shown in figure [ fig_k12 ] .",
    "here we considered two migration scenarios . in scenario 1 , only the outer planet undergoes migration , i.e. , @xmath58 and @xmath82 . in scenario 2 ,",
    "the inner one migrates outward and the outer one migrates inward , i.e. , @xmath58 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . as can be seen from figure [ fig_k 12 ] , the @xmath0 value is constrained in a relative wide range about 1 - 100 on order of magnitude .",
    "we note this @xmath0 range is consistent with the hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite which predicts a @xmath0 value of order of unity , and with dynamical modeling of the well - studied system gj876 by @xcite which prefers @xmath85 .",
    "in this paper , we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of planet pairs near first order mmr . focusing on the evolution of orbital period ratio , we find it could have an asymmetric distribution around the nominal mmr center regardless of whether dissipation is included or not .    applying the asymmetric nature of mmr to the _ kepler _ planets , we find that , without dissipation , _ kepler _ planets asymmetric period ratio distribution could be _ partly _ explained for the case of 3:2 mmr but _ not _ for 2:1 mmr , suggesting that dissipation or other mechanisms may play a more important role in 2:1 than in 3:2 mmr .    beside the _ kepler _ planets , similar asymmetric feature , i.e. , planets piled up wide of mmr , is also seen in rv planets .",
    "nevertheless , planets in multiple rv systems are bimodal distribution on mass , and the pileup is currently only seen in the higher mass group .",
    "the location of the pileup is consistent with the scenario that planetary migration toward mmr , and it infers that the ratio of damping rate between eccentricity and semimajor axis ( i.e. , k value ) during planet migration is @xmath86 on order of magnitude for massive planets .",
