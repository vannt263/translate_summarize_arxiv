    "the goal of this paper is to show that the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation provides a rough description and classification of large waves and predicts the existence of so - called `` rogue waves '' .",
    "rogue waves ( also known as monster waves , freak waves , killer waves , extreme waves , abnormal waves , etc . )",
    "are large ocean surface waves that occur far out in sea and appear spontaneously supposedly out of nowhere , even in calm seas .",
    "one such rogue wave caused the ocean ranger , then the world s largest offshore platform , to capsize in 1982 .",
    "rogue waves could appear in any place of the world ocean , @xcite .",
    "they present a threat even to large ships and ocean liners . until recently rogue waves were mostly known to exist only through anecdotal evidence provided by those who had encountered them at sea ; mariners testimonies of rogue waves were often treated with disbelief despite the damages inflicted by such waves on ships .",
    "it all changed after the scientific measurement positively confirmed the existence of a large wave at the draupner platform , in the north sea on january 1 , 1995 . since then numerous accounts of rogue waves have been reported , mostly in media .",
    "it s not just ships and offshore structures that need to worry about rogue waves ; the u.s .",
    "navy has expressed concern that some coast guard rescue helicopters lost at sea may have been struck by rogue waves @xcite .",
    "can rogue wave shoot up so high as to present a danger to helicopters ?    it has been observed that large / rogue waves often appear in sets of more than one , the famous sets of threes known as `` three sisters '' are often quoted . according to some accounts three sisters have been observed in lake superior . as unbelievable as the stories of rogue waves might have been , even less believable",
    "are the stories of the phenomenon known among russian sailors as `` devyatiy val '' ( which may be translated as `` the ninth super - wave '' or `` the ninth wall of water '' ) and popularized quite unscientifically by ivan aivazovsky in his famous painting of the same name . according to the folklore",
    ", rogue waves may appear in groups among which the ninth wave is the strongest and the most devastating , hence the name .",
    "ancient greeks held similar beliefs only it was the tenth rather then the ninth wave that was the most powerful .",
    "is the `` devyatiy val '' just a fiction or may there be a grain of truth in it ?",
    "rogue waves have now been hypothesized as a cause for many unexplained sea losses over the years including the losses over the bermuda triangle .",
    "but can this explanation account for the loss of airplanes ?",
    "although not very likely , the aforementioned cost guard report certainly leaves the possibility open . as far - fetched as it might be , it is more realistic than the explanations involving `` worm - holes '' , extra - terrestrial life - forms or the paranormal .",
    "there seems to be a fad nowadays to refer to any large oceanic / lake wave as a `` rogue wave '' .",
    "given the abundance of atmospheric , oceanographic and geological phenomena on earth it is very unlikely that all large waves have the same cause(s ) and exhibit the same behavior .",
    "there are currently many models claiming to describe rogue waves , at least some must be fairly successful in describing some type(s ) of large waves .",
    "since large waves considerably differ from each other in shape and behavior it is very unlikely that one single model can describe all of them . in this article the term `` rogue waves ''",
    "is restricted to the large waves which appear seemingly out of nowhere in relatively calm waters , have a relatively short life - span and are localized in a relatively small region of space .",
    "we will show that singular solutions of the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation provide a surprisingly good description of the shape of at least some large non - rogue waves and lead to the prediction of the existence of true rogue waves .",
    "we will not address the cause of any of these waves .",
    "the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation is chosen as the simplest nonlinear equation of water waves in @xmath0 many of whose solutions may be computed explicitly .",
    "one , of course , should understand that the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation may provide only a limited description of the phenomena .",
    "it is quite surprising that the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation turns out to be so useful as both the singular solutions and the large waves exit on the borderline of applicability of the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation derived to describe waves in shallow water .",
    "we will address the applicability of the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation in the last section .",
    "the original derivation of the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation was reported in @xcite , since then different derivations based on essentially the same ideas appeared in numerous publications . for the completeness s sake and because some parts of the derivation will be referred to later on in the paper , we shall reproduce the derivation here .",
    "typically the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation is derived for shallow water waves ; however , as point 4 of the derivation below shows the validity of the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation may be extended to waves in non - shallow water with the vertical component of the motion basically varying only in a near - surface layer .",
    "to do so consider the motion of fluid , subject to the following assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "the fluid is considered in the region of the three - dimensional space @xmath0 described by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is sufficiently small .",

    "the fluid is irrotational , i. e. the velocity vector @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "consequently the fluid has a velocity potential @xmath15 , i.e @xmath16 the assumption of irrotational flow means that there are no non - uniform underlying currents .",

    "the event may appear to the crew of a vessel carried by the current as a very powerful wave followed by a few less powerful ones with another powerful wave int he end . whereas the first one hits the vessel which is still intact and with the relatively fresh crew it may not appear that strong , the last one hits the vessel already heavily pounded with an exhausted crew .",

    "otins rise in the regions shown in figures [ fig:8 ] - [ fig:9 ] in black or close to black shades , these are the regions whose surface is considerably below the sea level and where a lot of underwater traffic takes place , such regions are just giant troughs in the ocean . since the surface of such a trough is below the sea level , it makes even a modestly tall otin to appear considerably taller , e.g. an 4 meter otin rising from a trough 3 meters deep appears to the crew of a ship that happens to be in the same trough to be 7 meters tall thus contributing to more drastic perception of the otin .",

    "in this paper we used singular solutions of kp to explain certain observed phenomena , our description and explanation of large and rogue waves considerably differ from other existing models .",
    "so the natural question is `` is it valid ? ''",
    "there are several points to consider .",
    "the first one is whether we can use kp to describe waves in non - shallow water .",
    "the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation is typically derived for shallow water waves with condition ( 2.4 ) interpreted as the plane @xmath251 being the bed of the body of water . in this paper",
    "we assume that the body of water is not necessarily shallow not necessarily shallow but the relevant flow is restricted to a near - surface layer @xmath252 below which the vertical component of the flow can be neglected .",
    "such an assumption may not bode well with many a researcher who are used to thinking that any motion on the surface should be felt all the way down to the very bottom , yet anyone with even a minimal scuba diving experience can attest to the fact that often even very powerful waves on the surface of the ocean have very little if any at all effect at the depths of even 10 - 15 meters .",
    "what contributes to the disappearance of the flow at greater depths is the viscosity of water small but nevertheless nonzero , internal flows , the motion of plankton and fish , interaction with waves reflected from the floor , etc . in view of all of this ,",
    "our assumption that the relevant portion of the ( not necessarily shallow ) flow is restricted to a rather thin near - surface layer @xmath252 with ( 2.4 ) on @xmath253 is not unreasonable .",
    "the second point is whether we may use kp to describe waves of relatively large amplitude . indeed",
    ", why would solutions of an equation derived for waves of relatively small amplitude work for waves of a relatively large amplitude ?",
    "if we look closer at the functions considered such as the ones reproduced in figure [ fig : singular ] we will see that each such function consists of two parts : one is outside the black parallelogram and the other one is inside .",
    "the former is of small amplitude and very well within the regime of kp , it is the latter that contains a crest of large amplitude and a trough extending all the way to @xmath159 taking these functions outside of the regime of kp .",
    "however , since the largest portion of the solution shown is outside of the black parallelogram and within the regime of kp it must describe the corresponding physical wave quite well ; we may assume therefore that its continuation inside the parallelogram is at least qualitatively similar to the physical wave .",
    "singular solutions are often discarded as nonphysical which may be the case for some , but as shown in this paper the singular solutions discussed in the paper provide a rather good qualitative description of corresponding physical waves .",
    "the very existence of the singular curve is somewhat contradictory as we assume the flow is shallow yet the singularity extends all the way down to @xmath254 .",
    "estimate ( 2.43 ) allows us to interpret the singularity as an indication of a strong undertow in the region near the singularity , yet since kp is not capable of describing such an undertow the singularities appear .",
    "the physical waves corresponding to such solutions do not have crests as high as predicted by the solutions and troughs extending all the way to @xmath254 , but their crests are still relatively tall and troughs are relatively deep . the solutions of kp discussed in this paper are often referred to as `` mathematical caricatures '' rather than `` mathematical models '' due to the fact that just like regular caricatures they provide rather sketchy description of the phenomena with some features exaggerated and some others suppressed .    , [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4plus ] .",
    "the regions outside black parallelograms are within the regime of kp while the regions inside the black parallelograms are not . ]",
    "philosophically speaking we may compare the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation to a curved mirror shown in figure [ fig : mirror ] .",
    "a small mosquito flying a few centimeters away from the mirror would see an almost perfect reflection of itself but the image of a large building would be significantly distorted .",
    "yet even distorted , the building s features could be easily seen and distinguished . just like the curved mirror the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation produces almost a perfect reflection of certain small waves with its soliton solutions ; larger waves are described by singular solutions which distort the dimensions but manage to preserve main features of the waves providing a unified albeit very primitive qualitative theory of large and rogue waves predicting the existence of `` crossings '' for the waves shown in figure [ fig:4plus ] , the existence of bulge inside the trough for the waves shown in figure [ fig:7aab ] , the existence of otins , the clustering of rogues waves in groups of threes as shown in figure [ fig:9 ] , the appearance of rogue waves seemingly out of nowhere and after a short while disappearance seemingly without a trace , etc . in other words , they show that there is `` a method to the mess '' and the same underlying principles are responsible for all these phenomena .",
    "we should also notice that the solutions of kp discussed do not take into account wave overturning / breaking and behave as if wave overturning / breaking does not exist even though formula ( 2.43 ) predicts wave overturning / breaking as it implies that the higher points on the crest move faster than the lower ones . to incorporate overturning / breaking into the model kp needs to be replaced with another equation , unfortunately what kind of equation the author",
    "does not know yet .",
    "although it might be tempting to replace the singular solutions discussed in the paper with regular ones expressible in terms of the riemann @xmath255function with appropriately chosen parameters , such a replacement might not be very useful .",
    "such a replacement would allow us to remove the singularities at the price of replacing rather simple solutions with much more complicated ones which have essentially the same behavior .",
    "the very presence of singular curves allows us to separate wave ( 3.5 ) into halves given by ( 3.9 ) or the waves shown in figures [ fig:4plus ] , [ fig:4minus ] into waves shown in figures [ fig:5plus ] , [ fig:5minus ] .    in  3 singular solutions and their superpositions",
    "are given by formulas ( 3.1 ) , ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.5 ) , ( 3.6 ) , ( 3.11 ) , ( 3.12 ) , ( 3.15 ) , yet so far the author has not succeeded in combining these formulas into a single one .",
    "the singular solutions discussed here are only the simplest singular solutions of kp , it is possible and very likely that singular solutions not discussed here may shed some light on other physical phenomena .",
    "for completeness sake we mention that there have been previous attempts to model rogue waves using kp .",
    "for example , @xcite tried to model rogue waves using two - soliton solutions .",
    "their main idea is predicated on the observation that the value of such a solution is considerably larger at the intersection of the solitons and thus may represent a rogue wave .",
    "such attempts , however , were doomed to fail from the start mainly because physical rogue waves appear seemingly out of nowhere and after a short while disappear seemingly without a trace but the two - soliton solutions preserve their shape and move as a whole with velocity given by ( 3.4 ) .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to explain rogue waves in terms of modulation instability for kp , formation of @xmath256function type of solutions of kp , etc . as well as some properties of solutions of the korteweg - de vries equation , the nonlinear schrodinger equation and several other equations .",
