    "in 1905 albert einstein@xcite suggested to determine the boltzmann constant @xmath3 ( `` elementary quanta '' ) by thermally agitated voltage of a capacitor .",
    "it was a lecture delivered by einstein on statistical mechanics which stimulated a phd student of max planck , walter schottky to consider the problem of tube noise and to develop his theory on the shot noise effect which opened the possibility of an alternative method for measurement of electron charge @xmath4;@xcite for additional historical remarks see also ref .  .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to describe how those ideas can be realized in a day using contemporary low noise operational amplifiers within the budget of 137  $ .",
    "the experimental set - up is so simple that can be given to students as an exercise for do - it - yourself task for fundamental constants measurement and can be made by every high school physics teacher .",
    "let us describe the idea .",
    "having a capacitor @xmath5 switched in parallel with a resistor @xmath6 , the thermally averaged common voltage is given by the equipartition theorem @xmath7 thermal voltages @xmath8 are too small to be measured directly but using low noise amplifier with almost constant amplification @xmath9 or @xmath10  db , can be determined by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the amplified voltage measured with the multimeter .",
    "first attempt was made by habicht brothers@xcite but their electrostatic multiplicator suffers from significant floating of the zero . in the present work",
    "we suggest a simple electronic scheme using contemporary integral circuits .",
    "square of the amplified voltage @xmath12 can be determined analogously using multipliers @xmath13 ; the constant @xmath14 is of order of 1  v. moreover , time averaging can be performed by a low pass filter with very large time constant @xmath15 of order of 1 minute .",
    "this final averaged voltage @xmath16 can be measured with a multimeter .",
    "schematically this chain of sequentially transformed voltages is depicted in fig .  ... and finally , the voltage on the capacitor in eq .",
    "( [ equipartition ] ) can be determined by experimentally measurable quantities @xmath17 and non ideality factor which is close to one @xmath18is a matter of routine calculation related to the electronic scheme , typically @xmath19 .",
    "the offset voltage @xmath20 is created mainly by internal noise of the amplifier and can be excluded if we measure the averaged voltage @xmath21 for different capacitors and make a linear regression @xmath21 versus @xmath22 .",
    "the slope of the linear regression gives the temperature in energy units @xmath23 , and for known temperature in conditional units we measure the boltzmann constant @xmath3 .",
    "the offset voltage @xmath20 is proportional to the input electric noise @xmath24 for the used ada-4898@xcite operational amplifier and the pass - bandwidth of the amplifier .",
    "tracing of the history of determination of boltzmann constant @xmath3 and electron charge @xmath4 by electric noise from the fundamental physics@xcite to the students laboratory , @xcite methodological articles and textbooks , @xcite and contemporary metrology @xcite gives the milestones of development of physics .",
    "the purpose of the present work is methodical to suggest a do - it - yourself set - up and in appendices to give reference to the state of the art theoretical derivation of the used formulae . from many years",
    "the measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is included in the undergraduate physics laboratories . in all these labworks",
    "it is suggested to use standard commercial electronic devices : amplifiers , filters , ohmmeters , oscilloscope , charging batteries , rms - meter , key attenuator , functional generator , etc .",
    "@xcite continuing this tradition we suggest a simple electronic scheme , which consists of three standard integrated circuits ( two double operational amplifiers and one analog multiplier ) , photodiodes , capacitors , and resistors and can be built for every undergraduate and even high school laboratory .",
    "the building of that cheap set - up is possible due to appearance of operational amplifiers whose input voltage noise does not exceed 1nv@xmath25 , such as the products of analog devices ,  @xcite texas instruments , etc .",
    "in addition , we have four - quadrant analog multipliers ( with buried zener ) with nonlinearity better than 1% .",
    "@xcite for many years a made from scratch set - up for measurement of a fundamental constant by statistical methods has been an alternative for students in university of sofia to pass the exam in statistical physics .",
    "the work is organized as follows :    * in the next sec .",
    "[ thermal_noise ] we will analyze measurement the @xmath3 by thermal noise . * the shot noise as a tool for determination of @xmath4 will be considered in sec .",
    "[ shot_noise ] . * the experimental set - up will be described in sec .",
    "[ setup ] . * in order to alleviate the text , state of the art calculation of the bandwidth of the amplifier is given in appendix  [ electronics_in_nutshell ] .",
    "* the background theoretical physics is given in other appendixes ; the appendixes are to be published in arxiv and are addressed to colleagues involved in construction of similar set - ups for educational physics experiment .",
    "almost 20 years after einstein suggestion , johnson@xcite realized the idea to determine boltzmann constant by measurements of electric noise .",
    "the square of the electric voltage can be presented by frequency integration of the voltage spectral density @xmath26 @xmath27 analyzing one dimensional black - body radiation in a transmission line as a _",
    ", nyquist@xcite obtained the general expression for the spectral density of the voltage noise expressed by the real part of the impedance @xmath28\\\\ & & \\nonumber\\qquad\\quad   = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega/2}{\\tanh\\left(\\hbar\\omega/2t\\right)}\\approx t , \\quad \\mbox{for } \\ ; \\hbar\\omega\\ll t\\equiv k_\\mathrm{b}t^{\\prime}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for example , having a capacitor @xmath5 parallely connected with a resistor @xmath6 @xmath29 the substitution of this frequency dependence of the resistance @xmath30 in the above spectral density eq .",

    "( [ u_frequency_integration ] ) gives the equipartition formula eq .",
    "( [ equipartition ] ) .    in the experiment for investigation of the noise of resistors a resistor @xmath31",
    "is directly connected to the input of the amplifier . for illustration , we suggest to connect a low pass filter ( lpf ) after the amplifier , a voltage divider with sequentially connected resistor @xmath32 and capacitor @xmath33 , with transmission coefficient @xmath34 then for the time averaged square of the amplified voltage we obtain @xmath35\\!b,\\\\&&\\nonumber b \\approx k^2\\frac1{4\\tau_{_\\mathrm{lpf}}},\\quad r_{||}\\equiv\\frac{rr_f}{r+r_f},\\quad \\frac1{\\tau_{_\\mathrm{lpf } } } = \\frac1{r_{_\\mathrm{lpf}}c_{_\\mathrm{lpf}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vnoise ] for the set - up described in the section set - up[setup ] . here",
    "the @xmath36 term describes the thermal noise of the resistors of the amplifiers described in the section set - up ; there will be calculated the pass - bandwidth @xmath37     versus resistivity @xmath6 according eq .",
    "( [ electric_noise ] ) ]    for the special case of @xmath38 and @xmath39 we return to eq .",
    "( [ c_determination ] ) .",
    "however , now we will change not the capacitor of the filter but the johnson resistor @xmath6 at the input of the amplifier .",
    "amplified voltage has to be squared and time averaged .",
    "measuring the dc voltage @xmath40 for different resistors by a multimeter , we can perform parabolic regression of the data .",
    "the curvature is determined by the current noise of the operational amplifier @xmath41 for ada  4898.@xcite the boltzmann constant is given by the linear coefficient @xmath42 of the polynomial regression @xmath43 describing the slope of the curve @xmath40 at small resistances @xmath44    in the next section we will describe how this set - up can be used for determination of the electron charge @xmath45 instead introducing notations for the coefficient of the parabolic fit , we use the notations for derivatives because in some sense polynomial fit is a tool for differentiation of a function tabulated with noise .",
    "as far as we know the schottky@xcite idea was realized for first time by in 1925 by hull and williams;@xcite see also the papers of n. h. williams and w. s. huxford  @xcite and johnson  @xcite .",
    "if a mean current @xmath46 is created by incoherent quantum transitions , this current is a sum of independent charge impulses of different electron transitions @xmath47 here we suppose that random electron impulses are homogeneously distributed in time with averaged rate of @xmath48 electrons per unit time .",
    "typical examples are electron in vacuum diodes or as in our casephotodiode illuminated by an electrical lamp ; definitely the incoherent black body radiation , not a light by light emitting diode ( led ) , which emits correlated photons and the mean charge of the impulse can exceed many electron charges .",
    "the spectral density of the current of these electron shots is proportional to the electron charge @xmath49 the spectral density is the integrand of averaging of squares @xmath50    if the current passes through a resistor , for the averaged voltage we have @xmath51 and analogously for the voltage spectral density @xmath52 this shot noise has to be added to the thermal noise and eq .",
    "( [ electric_noise ] ) now reads @xmath53\\!b.\\ ] ]     versus resistivity @xmath6 according eq .",
    "( [ electric_noise ] ) ]    quantum shots of the electron current can be created by a photodiode and by changing the intensity of light we can change the averaged voltage @xmath54 and the schottky noise .",
    "in such a way we can investigate the dependence @xmath55 and perform the linear regression .",
    "the slope of the line @xmath56 can be graphically calculated as a ratio of the differences , and for the electron charge we finally derive @xmath57 for applicability of this result , we suppose that electron shots do not overlap significantly @xmath58    as we mentioned , the purpose of the present work is purely methodological suggesting a simple do - it - yourself set - up which is described in the next section .",
    "the electric circuit of the proposed set - up is depicted at fig .  [",
    "fig : circuit ] , read the self - explained figure caption .",
    "in conclusion we hope that if all the parameters of the experimental set - up are carefully taken into account , an accuracy better than a percent in extracting the electron charge @xmath59 , and boltzmann constant @xmath60 can be reached . in high schools",
    "we can use approximation @xmath61 and within several percent accuracy we need no integration .",
    "additionally , we can use higher frequency op amp and many nia with moderate amplification , and this will increase @xmath62 for the whole amplification sequence . as the budget is less than 137  $ @xmath63 , the present experimental set - up can be easily reproduced in every university and high - school in the world .",
    "the current task which we set in the agenda for the physics education labs is determination of the boltzmann constant by the method originally suggested by einstein , not by dissipation , but by measurement of the averaged energy of a capacitor @xmath64 just as an illustration of the john james waterston equipartition theorem from the beginning of statistical physics .",
    "the authors would like to thank many students for reproducing the experimental set - up and collaboration in the early stages of this work .",
    "one of the authors tmm is thankful to genka dinekova and pancho cholakov for recommending ada4898 @xcite in the beginning of the present work and for a valuable bit of advice related to the integrated circuits tested in the development of our set - up .",
