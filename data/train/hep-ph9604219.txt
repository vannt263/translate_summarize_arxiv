    "<S> in particular the chiral condensate of @xmath0 pairs is parametrized with two angles , @xmath1 which measures the chiral condensation , and @xmath2 which measures the chiral rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the strong cp problem arises when it is assumed that the current quark masses of the standard model , have a @xmath2 phase that differs from the phase induced by the instanton term wich is originated in the qcd sector of the standard model . </S>",

    "<S> we show variationally that the physical vacuum is cp conserving and therefore the interplay of the instanton and the current mass terms can not produce any strong cp violation . </S>",

    "<S> first , we have the the lagrangian mass term @xmath5 where the @xmath6 current quark masses , explicitely break chiral symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> another well known mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking is furnished by the t hooft  @xcite coupling of the quark flavour determinant to the instanton , @xmath7 + h.c,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 are flavour indices .    </S>",
    "<S> finally the third cause of chiral symmetry breaking is due to the quark condensate @xmath9 which is generated dynamically  @xcite .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we will make use of valatin - bogolubov transformations to construct explicit examples of general orthogonal fock spaces consistent with quark condensation and chiral rotations . </S>",
    "<S> it is this residual freedom to self - consistently choose the fock space that constitutes the cornerstone of the mechanism alowing for the removal of cp violating phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the condensed vacuum @xmath10 can be generated from the trivial vacuum @xmath11 with a bogolubov - valatin transformation , generated by the parity invariant creator @xmath12 of quark antiquark pairs @xcite , @xmath13 then the @xmath10 is given by , @xmath14}| 0\\rangle    = \\prod_{c k}\\\\ & &        \\left[cos^2\\phi_{k}+sin\\phi_{k}cos\\phi_{k } c^\\dagger_{c k}+       { sin^2\\phi_{k } \\over 2 } { c^\\dagger}^2_{c k}\\right]| 0\\rangle ,        \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now using the dirac fermion fields , @xmath15 with the chiral spinors normalized with @xmath16 in order to be able to use massless spinors , we get the vacuum expectation value for the quark condensate , @xmath17 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 $ ] is positive in such a way that this expectation value is always negative and never vanishes . for current quark masses smaller than the scale of the strong confining interaction , </S>",
    "<S> this vev practically has a constant value .    </S>",
    "<S> this vacuum is an example of a wider class of vacua which will be denoted in this paper by @xmath19 . from the point of view of chiral physics </S>",
    "<S> , the extent of chiral symmetry breaking can be associated to the norm of a vector in a 2 dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> a cartesian basis of this space can be defined by the `` x - direction '' of the scalar condensate @xmath20 and by the orthogonal `` y - direction '' of the pseudoscalar condensate @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore it can be said with all generality that the fermion part of the strong interaction vacuum , must lie somewhere in a circle in this x - y plane and can be indexed by a polar angle which we denote by @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this polar angle parametrizes the chiral rotations generated by the @xmath23 operator @xmath24 .    to arrive at the vacuum @xmath25 from the trivial unstable vacuum @xmath26 we have to define an extended condensate generator in order to include any combination of scalar @xmath12 and pseudoscalar @xmath27 quark - antiquark pair creations , which we do by replacing in the equations [ [ creator ] ] @xmath28 by @xmath29 , @xmath30 i \\sigma_2\\ ] ] which in turn defines @xmath31 as , @xmath32 in eq . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath35 represents the pseudoscalar quark - antiquark creator , where the pseudoscalar spin wave function is @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to rotate directly from the @xmath37 to the @xmath38 with the generator @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we can show that we get the algebra , @xmath39=-2 iq_{s } \\ , \\ [ q_{s},q_5]=2 iq_{ip}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath40 @xmath23 generates the chiral rotation of the vacua , @xmath41 and the effect of this generator is depicted in fig.[[polar ] ] .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> we just have to bear in mind that all the vacua @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are orthogonal and they belong to independent fock spaces . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath45     \\   = \\delta_{0,\\theta}\\ ] ] thus all these vacua are independent and can not be reached pertubatively . </S>",
    "<S> each vacuum has its own field creators @xmath46 and field annihilators @xmath47 that can be used to generate the corresponding fock spaces @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> when there is only one source of chiral symmetry breaking , like @xmath49 , then we can trivially choose this vacuum to define the x - axis @xmath50    when a second source for chiral symmetry breaking exists , like for instance @xmath51 , then we have an extra direction and a p violating phase could be thouht to appear . to quote t hooft  @xcite , `` if other mass terms or interaction terms occur in the lagrangian that also violate chiral u(1 ) , then they may have a phase factor different from these . </S>",
    "<S> we then find that our effective lagrangian may violate p , whereas c invariance is maintained . ''    </S>",
    "<S> this is the origin of the strong cp problem , in the sense that strong cp violations have not yet been observed experimentally . in other words , because weak and strong interactions are independent , and in a sense one is skewed in relation to the other  @xcite , the angles @xmath52 ( which we had set to be the origin ) and @xmath53 are naturally expected to be different . </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrary example of this effect is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [  [ polar ] ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to show that a difference in the angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 may not cause strong cp violation .    </S>",
    "<S> if there were no explicit chiral symmetry breaking lagrangians @xmath49 and @xmath51 then a continuous degenerate set of orthogonal vacua would exist , and the whole hadronic physics could suffer a chiral rotation from the vacuum @xmath37 to another vacuum @xmath38 . for each @xmath2 we would find an identical replica of the whole hadronic world . </S>",
    "<S> nothing in strong interaction physics will distinguish one vacuum from another .    </S>",
    "<S> this is easy to see in a simplified version of @xmath51 provided by the lagrangian of baluni  @xcite with only 1 flavor . </S>",
    "<S> let us suppose that we have the following lagrangian , @xmath56 where @xmath57 contains the remainder of the q.c.d . </S>",
    "<S> lagrangian which is chiral invariant and should not concern us for the purpose of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we can use the valatin - bogolubov transformation , @xmath58 to get read of the complex cp violating masses . </S>",
    "<S> thus if instead of the fields @xmath59 , we use the chiral rotated fields @xmath60 then cp violation explicitely disappears from the lagrangian for the vacuum @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to show that this choice minimizes the vacuum energy , @xmath62+{\\cal e}_i \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath63 is therefore the physical vacuum of the system , and for this physical vacuum there remains no evidence of strong cp .    for the purpose of this letter it suffices to calculate the vacuum expectation value of the hamiltonian density , which can be performed with the help of the wick theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> let us define a class of t hooft determinants for n flavours as , @xmath64\\ ] ] where we drop the @xmath59 and from now on @xmath65 , @xmath66 represent the dirac fields of flavour @xmath65 , @xmath66 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hooft ] ) only the even terms in @xmath67 wich are cp conserving survive . </S>",
    "<S> in fact this is simply equivalent to insert an even number of @xmath67 matrices in the flavour determinant @xmath68 in all possible different ways . </S>",
    "<S> for instance we get the mass term for 1 flavour , whereas for 2 flavours we already get 4 terms , while for 3 flavors we would have 24 terms and so on , @xmath69 let us see how @xmath70 transforms with a general chiral rotation of angles @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we find , @xmath72 where @xmath73 has the same definition as @xmath70 except that it has an odd number of insertions of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath70 is cp invariant , @xmath73 is a pseudoscalar . </S>",
    "<S> because all the angles come in a sum , we see that from the point of view of chiral rotations @xmath70 has a single dimension , and thus is equivalent to a mass term in the flavour u(1 ) direction .    in order to study the vacuum energy we have to calculate the vacuum expectation values of the operators </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be performed with the wick contraction technique . as an illustration we give @xmath74 for the simpler case where all the flavours have the same condensate . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a bad approximation for the u , d quarks and of course this can also be calculated in the general case of unequal quark condensates . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 where g is a geometrical factor , @xmath76    in the general case we get for the vacuum energy density @xmath77 where @xmath74 is a given number and @xmath78 is given by @xmath79    in the litterature the @xmath55 is regarded as fixed . </S>",
    "<S> however for completness we will also consider the scenario where @xmath55 is a variational parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this is an @xmath80 scenario insofar that the evident solution is that @xmath55 will be `` aligned '' with the current mass chiral angles , @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the combination that yields the lowest vacuum energy . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the instanton lagrangian does not produce any cp violation either in strong or in weak interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> now we will suppose that @xmath82 is fixed and show that even in this case strong cp violation does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum condition is simply obtained when we differentiate eq.[[energy ] ] with respect to the @xmath83 , and we get the set of coupled equations , @xmath84 that can be easilly solved numerically . for small chiral angles and small current masses </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes linear an we get the simple solutions , @xmath85 thus only the lightest flavours are actually rotated because this corresponds to an average weighted by the inverse masses . if we inspect the light @xmath86 pseudoscalar meson masses with the help of the gell - mann , oakes and renner relations , together with the heavy meson masses , we get the approximate mass ratios , @xmath87 which in turn yield the chiral rotations , @xmath88 </S>"
