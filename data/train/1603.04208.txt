    "the study of quantum spin ice ( qsi ) on three dimensional ( 3d ) pyrochlore lattice has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "huang - chen - hermele @xcite have proposed an alternative hamiltonian for qsi in 3d pyrochlore lattice , applicable to certain class of @xmath2- and @xmath3-electron systems with dipolar - octupolar kramers doublets . using dimensional reduction @xcite , carrasquilla _",
    "et  al . _",
    ", @xcite have recently mapped this model to 2d kagome lattice with a [ 111 ] crystallographic field .",
    "they have identified the interaction that promotes a putative quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) state and uncovered the low - temperature quantum phase diagram using a non - perturbative , unbiased qmc simulations on the kagome lattice @xcite . in this system ,",
    "competition between the classical ising frustration and a @xmath0-invariant ferromagnetic quantum fluctuation lead to a putative qsl state .",
    "thus , there is a possibility to search for 2d qsl states within a class of pyrochlore quantum spin ice materials .",
    "the distinctive feature of the qsi hamiltonian is the presence of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we have recently studied the 2d quantum kagome ice hamiltonian of carrasquilla _",
    "et  al . _ , @xcite on the triangular lattice @xcite , using spin wave theory .",
    "an explicit numerical simulation has not been reported at the moment .",
    "however , spin wave theory still captures the interesting properties of the system because quantum fluctuations are suppressed in this model . in principle , there is a possibility of a ring exchange interaction that exhibits a @xmath0 symmetry , as in the u(1)-invariant xy model ( hard - core bosons ) with ring - exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "the ring exchange quantum spin hamiltonian is believed to be very important in wigner crystals near the melting density @xcite .",
    "they also promote interesting quantum properties with rich quantum phase diagram .    in this communication , we consider the competing interactions between a classically frustrated ising interaction and a @xmath0-invariant ring exchange interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the raising and the lowering spin operators respectively .",
    "a special feature of this hamiltonian is that it exhibits only @xmath0-symmetry in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane , _",
    "@xmath8-rotation about the @xmath9-axis in spin space , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( eq .  ) can be studied in any lattice geometry . however , for bipartite lattices , eq .",
    "is related to a u(1)-invariant model by a @xmath8-rotation about the @xmath6-axis on two sublattices , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 ; @xmath14 .",
    "we restrict our analyses to the triangular lattice .",
    "hence , the summation over the ring exchange term runs over the three possible four - spin plaquette orientations on a triangular lattice ; see fig .  .",
    "we will investigate the distinctive features of the pure @xmath0-invariant xy ring - exchange hamiltonian ( @xmath15 ) and its effects when competing with a classical ising frustration ( @xmath16 , with @xmath17 ) .",
    "the study of this hamiltonian is partially motivated by the quantum phases uncovered in 2d qsi hamiltonian @xcite and the recent study of the 2d qsi hamiltonian on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "in order to get an insight into the effects of @xmath0 symmetry of eq .  , we consider the pure-@xmath18 model in eq .  , which corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "in this limit , the resulting hamiltonian has a related u(1)-invariant counterpart @xcite .",
    "the important feature of the u(1)-invariant pure-@xmath18 model is that the energy spectra has a gapless quadratic excitation near @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , the present model is devoid of continuous symmetries .",
    "the behaviour of the excitation spectra is not known in literatures .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the excitations behave in the long wavelength limit .",
    "the hamiltonian , eq .  , in this limit ( @xmath15 ) can be written explicitly as @xmath19    classically , the ground state of eq .",
    "is highly degenerate resulting from the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the ground state corresponds to all possible spin configurations along the basis @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see fig .  ) , and it is independent of the sign of @xmath18 .",
    "there are several ways to investigate how quantum fluctuations select a particular classical ground state in this system . in the u(1)-invariant model ,",
    "this can be done by integrating out the phase fluctuations about the classical ground state in the path integral for the partition function @xcite .",
    "this method , however , is effectively the same as performing spin wave theory about any classical ground state of eq .  .",
    "the collective excitation spectrum is the same in both methods .",
    "since we have only @xmath6-@xmath7 coupling in eq .  , one can show that the excitation spectrum about any classical ground state is the same , provided one rotates the axes properly . in the present model there is no conserved quantity , it is expedient to use a direct spin wave theory via the holstein primakoff transform @xcite .",
